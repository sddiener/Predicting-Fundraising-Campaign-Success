<p><b>About NEO Neurophone Inventor Dr. Flanagan</b></p>A science prodigy, Dr. Flanagan began inventing at age 8 and was only 13 when he invented the Neurophone, hoping to aid him in learning as he slept.  By age 17, Patrick was featured in the 1962 LIFE Magazine issue, dedicated to America's best and brightest, in a feature story titled ""Whiz Kid, Hands Down"". He has since appeared in TIME Magazine, major national talk shows, countless articles and has spoken before international audiences about the Neurophone and his other amazing inventions across the world. <br/><br/>In 2013 and 2014, a whole new generation of fans have discovered Dr. Flanagan in a web series designed to inspire young people to follow his lead into science. The Doc has over 25 million views and counting for his hit web Flanagan on both Vimeo and YouTube produced by filmmaker Ken Sheetz of BuzzBroz, the doctor's host for this campaign. <p> </p>

<h2>Porquê um Ginásio do CDUP Rugby?</h2>
<p>Num contexto actual, onde a modalidade é cada vez mais exigente a nível físico, é fundamental para o sucesso de um equipa de rugby a preparação de cada atleta. Actualmente, o CDUP, ao contrário da maioria dos clubes da Divisão de Honra - principal escalão nacional - não tem ginásio próprio, facto que tem condicionado a performance dos nossos atletas que à data utilizam ginásios externos. </p>
<p>O grande objectivo do CDUP tem passado pela reconstrução do clube.  No ano passado, e após  anos de ausência, o clube regressou ao Estádio Universitário, com todos os escalões a treinar no mesmo espaço, 10 anos mais tarde. <br/>Este ano,  reforçou-se com dois preparadores físicos que trabalharão em conjunto os atletas de formação e competição, mas para que este trabalho dê frutos é imperativo que consigamos ter um local único onde todos possam  trabalhar a componente física.</p>
<p>É neste seguimento que surge então o projecto de construção de um ginásio, acessível a todos os atletas de rugby.</p>

You'll be able to receive audible feedback for your most recent swing without having to look at your phone.
Practice your perfect tempo with our metronome feature! More good news! If we reach $150,000 in funding, every backer will receive a METRONOME feature on our App for NO EXTRA COST! You'll be able to dial in the tempo of your swing with real time audio guidance.




We don’t teach you to swing like other golfers. CTRL gives you 100% customized training that teaches you to replicate your best swing, every single time. Why? Because no one swings the same.


You can't expect golfers of all different builds to swing the same way and get the same results, but that’s exactly what other golf training aids do. They train everyone on one universal, “ideal” swing, and it doesn’t work.

Instead, CTRL adapts to your unique style and learns exactly what swings work best for you.


 

 

 
 CTRL is the first of its kind—it’s a golf training tool that learns how you already swing and then gives you tips to improve your swing.The training algorithm learns from the individual user and their typical swing and measures everything that can be improved, like backswing and downswing times.The app also gives you feedback based on your ideal club path and club face.You don’t need to learn just one type of swing, you need to perfect the many swings necessary to succeed in different situations! Whether you need to hit a fade around a tree or hit a draw out from any other obstruction on the golf course, CTRL’s software creates a catalogue of your unique swings.Our motion sensors and advanced algorithm detect the slightest movements in your swing.CTRL’s feedback is made to be understood by everyone—first-timers, regular golfers and pros.We use simple graphics and plain English like “slow down your backswing” to help you pinpoint exactly what needs to be adjusted.CTRL provides feedback on the 3 most important aspects of your golf swing: tempo, club face and club path.These details determine where your ball will land by dissecting your tempo, consistency, what direction your ball takes off in, and how the ball curves in the air.Track your consistency and improvement over time with data and charts that show per session stats, the difference between various sessions and your improvement with different swings and clubs.CTRL is the easiest, most straightforward golf training tool on the market. We know that if a product takes more than 2 minutes to set up, you won’t use it. That’s why CTRL has just one sleeve and 2 pop-on sensors that work with every club and every swing. Our signature “weightless” sleeve is made of a special fabric blend that conforms to the wearer’s body, but feels as though nothing is there. It never interferes with your movement and even has a cooling effect.Our 2 hyper-sensitive motion sensors magnetically snap onto the sleeve and turn on with a simple double tap. Their tough nylon material withstands high temperatures and high G forces, meaning even the hottest days and most powerful swings have no effect on sensor performance.This app sets a new precedent in the world of golf feedback tools. Our intelligent algorithms learn as you swing and use your feedback to catalogue what’s working best for you along the way. It works for both Android and iOS.CTRL gives you control over your golf game in as little as 30 swings. It doesn’t matter if you play weekly or it’s your first time hitting the ball, our training algorithm flattens the learning curve so you advance with every swing.
Complete a minimum of 30 good swings
Give the app feedback on how the ball flew (fade, draw, straight, fat, thin, pull, push,)
Save your best swings
Enter the app’s feedback mode
Apply the simple training tips
Be amazed at your progress!
Every year, more than a billion dollars are spent on aids and golf lessons in the US alone. Despite this, golfers still aren’t getting the help they need because: CTRL is the solution you’ve been waiting for because it gives you step-by-step instructions that don’t require a coach’s interpretation. Every tip is easy to understand and implement, for even the newest golfer.There’s no limit to how much practice time you can get in with CTRL because you’re not limited to practicing on the green or at the range. With CTRL, you just slip on your sleeve, swing and watch your play improve.CTRL let’s you turn any place into a driving range. You don’t need to be outside, on a course or even have a ball! CTRL redefines the way we practice swings by eliminating the need to see where the ball goes. Once you have your swings locked in the app, you can practice anywhere, anytime, including your backyard, garage, basement or office!No coach is needed to use CTRL, but integration with a coach can help you master your best swing even faster!Your coach can change and tweak your swing during the lesson and then you can use the sleeve to lock in the motion they taught you. That way, you can be sure you’re practicing the proper swing when your coach isn’t around.CTRL is a cost-effective value add if you’re losing customers due to them showing little improvement. When clients don’t practice (or practice incorrectly), they fall back into what's comfortable and show no improvement by their next lesson. Not with CTRL. CTRL locks in the swing your students learned and ensures they practice the right motion.Every avid golfer knows there’s always room for improvement in your swings, especially as you advance to more challenging courses. CTRL’s hyper-sensitive sensors detect the tiny details that bring your swing from beginner to advanced!Whether you’ve never played golf or you need to “feel your swing” after a long period of not playing, this high-tech tool is your answer.Hitting a perfect shot is one of the best feelings in the world. It builds confidence and increases enjoyment that stays with you long after the game. But practice only makes perfect when the practice itself is a perfect fit for you. That’s why we created CTRL.With CTRL’s highly-customized training, every golfer can experience the incredible rush of hitting an impossible shot, and know that those major milestones of breaking 90 or 80 aren’t out of reach! They can get more enjoyment out of golfing and all that comes out of it like friendships, business deals, exercise and fresh air.It’s your game. We’re just here to help you perfect it.There's nothing worse than showing up to the course and realizing you've left your secret weapon at home. Now you're simply guessing how to practice! Pick up an extra sensor on discount while you can and make sure you can practice your perfect every single time.Stock up now on extra sleeves so you can always practice your perfect! Whether your main sleeve is in the wash when you want a day of practice, or just ripped on that loose screw on the golf cart, it’s best to assume you’ll want a backup, just in case.Get an extra charging stand for your home, in the car, or via the USB port on the golf cart. With a full charge time < 1 hr, you'll never have to worry about being able to practice your perfect again. Everyone know losing chargers is a given over time, so saving on a backup now guarantees your CTRL will always be juiced up when you need it!Let your loved ones know you're thinking of them this year with exclusive first access to the tool that's finally going to help them hit their golf goals!

NANO Pro provides 3 intensity levels, from warm-up, enhance to high intensity; from beginner to professional. It is compact but includes all the professional capabilities to meet everyone’s needs.


 

With high-powered torque of up to 600mN.m, 40lb force and a high-speed impact of 3500rpm, NANO Pro can precisely stroke into the hard-to-reach 8mm deep muscle group and effectively breaks up the lactic acid in the muscle for quick pain relief and fast recovery time after exercise. Offer you a very comfortable and pleasant experience!





Traditional massage guns are bulky, heavy, make them hard to be grasped with one hand. Also they take up much space and not easy to carry around. It’s time for innovation and reform. NOW, the emergence of Merach NANO Pro perfectly solves all the problems. NANO Pro is small, portable and can be easily operated with one hand. Professional no longer awkward anymore!

 The unique ergonomic design of NANO Pro provides you the highest quality and most comfortable massage experience.  Equipped with an embedded brushless motor and unique internal structure optimization technology, NANO Pro has a super low noise level of only 40dB at the 3500 rpm maximum speed, which is almost silent. Merach NANO Pro Noise Level Test 

 
The large battery capacity of 2500mah has a working time of 7-12.5 hours (the higher the speed, the faster the power consumption). With daily use of 15 mins on average, you can use NANO Pro for a month on one single charge.  Supports USB-C power delivery - the fastest and most popular charging technology, NANO Pro can be fully charged in less than 2 hours. Comes with 4 interchangeable massage heads to target all muscle groups and customize your massage, which can help you to relax all muscle tissues and obtain the safest and most comfortable protection.  The ultimate compact body of NANO Pro requires extremely demanding requirements in the manufacturing process. Whether it is the body shell or the main internal components, aluminum alloy precision machining manufacturing technology and integrated molding fuselage are applied. Compared with the traditional engineering plastics and stainless steel materials, aluminum alloy is high strength and lightweight with a much better thermal conductivity and exhibits good corrosion resistance. For maximum comfort and portability, both sides of the NANO Pro’s handles have soft silicone padding to assist with gripping, slip-resistant and anti-knock. Suitable for Your Whole Body Take it Anytime Anywhere   Comparison  The Differences Between NANO and NANO Pro   Merach is a brand specialized in researching, producing and selling household fitness equipment.

Nearly 40,000 sensors on the mat track each independent movement to provide accurate analysis and feedback while you follow the numerous range of exercise videos on the app. Various interactive features such as instructor’s voice feedback, burned calories display and encouragement tools offer you the experience of working out with a personal coach even at home. In short, MATIV helps you keep to a healthy habit of regularly working out whatever the situation or environment.   Monitor Your Workout in Real-time Embedded with 40,000 sensors and AI algorithm, MATIV distinguishes between nearly 300 movements and analyzes workout performance in real-time. This key feature of MATIV accurately monitors your training to identify appropriate situations to integrate its support features into your session.Rather than the systematic voice feedback that most standard exercise applications offer, MATIV’s voice response provides support in accordance with your specific performance at the optimum point, just as if a personal trainer is right beside you. For instance, when it detects you panting it could respond with, “You’re almost there, don’t give up!”, to help you push through until the end, or when you reach the top rank during a workout, “Well done! You’ve reached first place!”, could stimulate you to maintain the input.  On MATIV, amount of calories burned can be checked real-time during a workout, and detailed analysis of your performance against previous workouts or your friends’ performance can also be examined afterwards. The mass data collected is simulated through visual records such as graphs that lets you easily digest the analyzed information, keeping you motivated.  Check out how MATIV works!  How Does It Work? When you exercise with MATIV, movements made on top of the mat is recognized through its pressure sensors. Also, linear and rotational motion is detected on the band.The smart mat tracks the motion of your feet. As shown in the picture below, its 40,000 sensors accurately detect your feet’s position, gap and balance. The smart band tracks the arm’s motion. The 6-axis IMU sensor detects the range of motion including the speed and angle of each movement.  MATIV’s AI algorithm collects and analyzes the data from the smart mat and band at 20Hz. Through such analysis, MATIV can determine 300 different exercise movements such as jumping jacks, squats, lunges and planks in real-time.  The number of sets as well as its calorie consumption can also be determined. Such specific data collection and presentation can help you boost your form precision, strength and stamina, helping you reach your goals. The interactive workout mat on its own is sufficient to analyze your exercise data. However, for an even more accurate recognition of your movement, we recommend pairing it with our smart band to measure your arm motion as well as your footwork.

<p>We're a team of designers, developers and cyclists that spent two years creating a cycling computer that's 100% reliable. Our patented Absolute Positioning technology (APT) makes sure your routes never need re-calculating, your measured results are far more reliable and most importantly: we make sure you see these results in real-time. Because the APT is accurate within a range of 2 meters, it also <strong>makes an external speed sensor redundant</strong>. </p>

<p>By fusing GNSS (the catch-all term for GPS, Glonass, Galileo and others) with a combination of sensors inside our cycling computer it’s able to track your position more often and more accurately. The sensors check your location 20 times a second. That’s 20 times faster than relying on GNSS alone. This means that even if you’re racing at high speeds the margin of error remains very small; within 2 meters. And if you lose satellite connection our dead-reckoning algorithm will keep calculating your position using just the sensors. Whether you’re cycling through a tunnel, a forrest or near open water.  </p>
<p>We call this APT: <strong>Absolute Positioning Technology.</strong></p>

<p>Our Absolute Positioning Technology (APT) makes an external speed sensor redundant. The internal sensors fuses GNSS data to measure your speed and location 20 times more often than other cycling computers. Using this data in a smart <strong>cycling-specific algorithm</strong> the Absolute Cycling One is able to calculate your speed with a very high accuracy. Other cycling computers also measure speed but they only rely on GNSS data, meaning their calculations are only done once a second and therefore are usually very inaccurate. This results in most cyclists connecting external speed sensors to their bike, costing extra money, weighing more and making it less aerodynamic. </p>

<p>Together with sport/medical doctor Guido Vroemen (known for his work for team Roompot Charles) we created a special interface for pro training workouts. We collected data from pro riders, adventure cyclists and weekend warriors to decide which data was most important for a proper training. Together with our user experience developers at Eight Media we created an interface that presents this data in a clear and concise way. Even when you’re racing at high speeds. </p>

<p>During a ride you only have a split second to look down. You want to be able to quickly glance over the most important data. That’s why we choose 3″ full colour display with an <strong>800×480 resolution</strong> and a proper <strong>anti-glare screen &amp; anti-reflection screen. </strong>The high resolution makes it easy to distinguish data on your screen. It also makes the <strong>Mapbox maps</strong> look amazing and crystal clear. </p>
<p>The<strong> full colour</strong> display makes it a lot easier to differentiate between data. With our custom designed training screens you can even tell from a quick glance whether your power, heart rate, or cadence is still on track. If it is, good, the screen will show a big green bar. If it's not you'll end up in the red zone. It's as easy as that. </p>

<p><strong>You're in control</strong></p>
<p>When you’re racing at full speed with sweaty hands you don’t want want to use a touchscreen. That’s why the Absolute Cycling One doesn’t have a touchscreen. Just three sturdy buttons with a solid click. The left button will select the previous screen, the right button will select the next screen. Use the middle button to zoom in, click it again to zoom back out. Check the video below to see <strong>our prototype</strong> in action. </p>

<p>Upload your favourite routes and setup your training schedules using your phone. Our User Experience developers made sure that setting up your ride is extremely easy and a matter of seconds. And after the setup process, you can <strong>leave your phone at home</strong>! Our app is available for both iPhone and Android. </p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>Say you're at work, you look outside and you know you want to get One more ride in before sunset when you get home. All you have to do is select your favourite route or workout in the app on your phone and plan it. The Absolute Cycling One doesn't have to be connected just yet. When you get home you put on your cycling gear, grab the One from its wireless charger and click it in the mount on your favourite bike. When you turn it on, your planned routes will get uploaded from your phone to the One. All you have to do is select them and start cycling. The Hot Start GPS (more info below) feature will make sure you don't have to wait until it found a satellite fix. Just enjoy your ride. </p>

<p>Upload your favourite GPX and TCX routes to the Absolute Cycling One using our app. Because of our Absolute Positioning Technology there are no re-calibrations necessary when traversing your route. No more error messages mid-ride. Simply start the app, select or plan your routes and send them to the One. No need to wait for maps to load, just hop on your ride and start cycling! We're currently using Mapbox for our rendered maps. </p>

<p><strong>Hot start GPS</strong></p>
<p>When you turn off your cycling computer after your ride it will remember your current location. When you turn it back on again, and if the Absolute Cycling One is still in the same location, it won't have to search for a GNSS signal. All you have to do is hop back on your bike and it will instantly start tracking your location. We call this feature Hot Start GPS and it'll make navigating through the start of your routes a lot smoother. </p>
<p><strong>Sound design</strong></p>
<p>The Absolute Cycling One has a minimal built in sound indicator that you can turn on or off for your turn by turn navigation. It has auto-pause and auto-start functionality in case you're at a traffic light, when you start or stop an interval and of course, when you turn it on or off. </p>

<p><strong>Next generation processor</strong></p>
<p>The Absolute Cycling One uses a next generation Ultra low-power processor that can easily display full color graphics and custom rendered maps without draining the battery before your ride is finished. This processor matches high speed processors used in high-end smartphones reducing load-time significantly. </p>
<p><strong>Power optimised software</strong></p>
<p>We invested a lot of time and resources in our custom made software for our cycling computer. Our engineers and developers work hand-in-hand to create a system that gets the most out of our processor and other hardware without draining the battery.</p>
<p><strong>Perfectly matched battery</strong></p>
<p>Because we’re working with custom hardware and software we had the opportunity to select the perfect battery for our cycling computer. We’ve selected a battery size that gives the computer a battery life of 20 hours without making concessions on weight, size and aerodynamics. This removes the need to bring an extra power-bank to long distance rides. </p>

<p>No more broken or missing cables! After your ride you can simply place the Absolute Cycling One on the charging dock (included with all the Indiegogo perks) and it’ll start charging. Because it has a 20 hour battery life it’ll never run out during the ride, which we also felt was an important part of the user experience. Nothing is as frustrating as losing all your data at the end of an amazing ride. Since the One handles everything over Bluetooth, WiFi or ANT+, it doesn’t have any usb-jacks, making it a lot more durable and <strong>waterproof</strong>. The Absolute Cycling One will be shipped with a wireless charging dock included in the box. </p>

<p>For our Absolute Fans we designed a branded cycling shirt together with Vedette Incognito. The cycling shirt is made from a lightweight (125g/m2) ""Cooltech Polyester"". This Italian fabric quickly absorbs and disperses transpiration from your body keeping you and your shirt dry during your rides. The extra long Lycra sleeves are made from extra elastic fibre meaning it'll fit around your arms perfectly. The Asteria Lycra material dries quickly and breathes naturally. Below the arms is a 4-way stretch mesh for extra cooling. This fabric is double-woven and extremely light (90 g/m2). The shirt is a slim-fit making it extra aerodynamic. On the back are three open pockets and one extra pocket with a YKK zipper. </p>

<p>All cycling computers use GNSS (the catch-all term for GPS, Glonass, Galileo and others). Once every second (1hz) these cycling computers will try to capture multiple satellite signals and use them to locate its position. The problem here is that the computer needs to be in visible contact with the sky to make it accurate. This means that you may lose connection when cycling through a forest, a tunnel or near open waters. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5z8WyNY8ASg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Current Situation (GNSS)</strong></p>
<p>Every 3 seconds regular cycling computers take an average of your last location and use them to predict where you’re going. This usually results in unrealistic real-time tracking of your current location. You’re probably trying to push yourself to the limits, going as fast as you can, quickly turning these small tracking errors into a <strong>difference of multiple meters</strong>. This is why most cyclists connect external speed sensors to increase their accuracy. Unfortunately this adds weight, ruins aerodynamics and requires setup and calibration. </p>
<p><strong>What our technology does differently</strong></p>
<p>By combining GNSS with a combination of sensors inside our cycling computer it’s able to track your position more often and more accurately. The sensors check your location 20 times a second. That’s <strong>20 times faster</strong> than relying on GNSS alone. This means that even if you’re racing at high speeds the margin of error remains very small; <strong>within 2 meters</strong>. And if you lose satellite connection our dead-reckoning algorithm will keep calculating your position using just the sensors. Whether you’re cycling through a tunnel, a forrest or near open water.  </p>
<p>We call this APT: <strong>Absolute Positioning Technology</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://absolutecycling.nl/wp-content/uploads/GNSS-APT.gif"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560782885/lbhu1e7bpeyzcx0g0ikn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>For our proof of concept we did a testrun using an extremely accurate RTK measuring tool. It can track your location with an accuracy &lt;1cm and will keep on working for a very long time after losing satellite connection.  You might be wondering: “why don’t you just implement that technology in the Absolute Cycling One?” Excellent question! The technology used for this test is extremely expensive (about €250.000) but more importantly; it would make your ride look something like this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559846479/qsnbugrxphcoujmkfzjj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>In this graph you see the €250.000 reference compared to the tracking done by a different expensive GPS-only measuring device. It uses Internet to increase its accuracy. The average mean margin of error is about 0.8 meters making it very accurate. You can see where the device lost satellite connection because it simply stopped measuring that part of the route. Another downside is that this technology requires a constant connection with the internet and it’s far too expensive to implement in a cycling computer. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560783282/vhdcfxzmoc11ogjxrv15.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In this graph you see how the competitors accuracy compares to the reference created by the extremely expensive but accurate RTK measuring device. The competitors technology calculates a route based on measured GPS locations. Since it lost connection with a satellite a couple of times, these measurements are off by about 5 meters. That’s quite a distance, especially when you’re cycling at high speeds! Next up is our own Absolute Positioning Technology:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560783292/gecdqtexk3jp5l1tniqb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As you can see in this final graph, our Absolute Positioning Technology is off by about 0.75 meters. That’s less than the GPS technology that requires constant connection to the internet. More notable is the fact that it never skips a part of the route. Even if it loses satellite connection it uses its internal sensors to calculate your speed and location (amongst other data). Since it doesn’t need an internet connection it stays reliable, even in rural or harsh outdoor terrain. Our genius developers at Inspiro are working very hard to increase the accuracy even more before the crowdfunding campaign launches. </p>

<p>In the early development stages, Harm (the founder of Absolute Cycling) felt that a cycling computer should not only work perfectly, it should also look and feel amazing. You have to want to add it to your bike. Knowing Harm couldn’t do this alone, he made a bold move and contacted the designers known for their work for Bang &amp; Olufsen: <strong>Valeur Designers</strong>. One phone call and a plane ticket later he was in their studio in Denmark. It turned out one of their lead-designers -Jens-Christian Møller- is an avid cyclist so he was eager to jump on board. </p>

</div></div>","We're a team of designers, developers and cyclists that spent two years creating a cycling computer that's 100% reliable. Our patented Absolute Positioning technology (APT) makes sure your routes never need re-calculating, your measured results are far more reliable and most importantly: we make sure you see these results in real-time. Because the APT is accurate within a range of 2 meters, it also makes an external speed sensor redundant. 



 









 


 


By fusing GNSS (the catch-all term for GPS, Glonass, Galileo and others) with a combination of sensors inside our cycling computer it’s able to track your position more often and more accurately. The sensors check your location 20 times a second. That’s 20 times faster than relying on GNSS alone. This means that even if you’re racing at high speeds the margin of error remains very small; within 2 meters. And if you lose satellite connection our dead-reckoning algorithm will keep calculating your position using just the sensors. Whether you’re cycling through a tunnel, a forrest or near open water.  
We call this APT: Absolute Positioning Technology.
 



 
Omroep Gelderland (the Netherlands) did a report on the Absolute Cycling One prototype (which is bigger than the final product will be) during the Rush Hour pro race. The developers at Inspiro made sure that we could track the data of 5 racers in real-time. You can view the results of one of the racers on the bottom of the crowdfunding page. 

 

 
Our Absolute Positioning Technology (APT) makes an external speed sensor redundant. The internal sensors fuses GNSS data to measure your speed and location 20 times more often than other cycling computers. Using this data in a smart cycling-specific algorithm the Absolute Cycling One is able to calculate your speed with a very high accuracy. Other cycling computers also measure speed but they only rely on GNSS data, meaning their calculations are only done once a second and therefore are usually very inaccurate. This results in most cyclists connecting external speed sensors to their bike, costing extra money, weighing more and making it less aerodynamic. 

 


 
Compatibility chart
All the current integrations and future updates! 

 


The Absolute Cycling One is fully customisable to fit your needs. Zoom in on your most important statistics and remove the ones you don't want to see. Simply tell the One what kind of training you're going for and it will show you what you need to know when you need to know it the most. 



Watch the video below to see the Absolute Cycling One prototype up close. Harm talks about the current prototype size, switching between the different screen types and what will be in store for you in the future. Remember, the size of the device will end up being smaller than in the video. 

 

Together with sport/medical doctor Guido Vroemen (known for his work for team Roompot Charles) we created a special interface for pro training workouts. We collected data from pro riders, adventure cyclists and weekend warriors to decide which data was most important for a proper training. Together with our user experience developers at Eight Media we created an interface that presents this data in a clear and concise way. Even when you’re racing at high speeds. 

 

During a ride you only have a split second to look down. You want to be able to quickly glance over the most important data. That’s why we choose 3″ full colour display with an 800×480 resolution and a proper anti-glare screen & anti-reflection screen. The high resolution makes it easy to distinguish data on your screen. It also makes the Mapbox maps look amazing and crystal clear. 
The full colour display makes it a lot easier to differentiate between data. With our custom designed training screens you can even tell from a quick glance whether your power, heart rate, or cadence is still on track. If it is, good, the screen will show a big green bar. If it's not you'll end up in the red zone. It's as easy as that. 

You're in control
When you’re racing at full speed with sweaty hands you don’t want want to use a touchscreen. That’s why the Absolute Cycling One doesn’t have a touchscreen. Just three sturdy buttons with a solid click. The left button will select the previous screen, the right button will select the next screen. Use the middle button to zoom in, click it again to zoom back out. Check the video below to see our prototype in action. 

 

Upload your favourite routes and setup your training schedules using your phone. Our User Experience developers made sure that setting up your ride is extremely easy and a matter of seconds. And after the setup process, you can leave your phone at home! Our app is available for both iPhone and Android. 
How it works
Say you're at work, you look outside and you know you want to get One more ride in before sunset when you get home. All you have to do is select your favourite route or workout in the app on your phone and plan it. The Absolute Cycling One doesn't have to be connected just yet. When you get home you put on your cycling gear, grab the One from its wireless charger and click it in the mount on your favourite bike. When you turn it on, your planned routes will get uploaded from your phone to the One. All you have to do is select them and start cycling. The Hot Start GPS (more info below) feature will make sure you don't have to wait until it found a satellite fix. Just enjoy your ride. 

 

Upload your favourite GPX and TCX routes to the Absolute Cycling One using our app. Because of our Absolute Positioning Technology there are no re-calibrations necessary when traversing your route. No more error messages mid-ride. Simply start the app, select or plan your routes and send them to the One. No need to wait for maps to load, just hop on your ride and start cycling! We're currently using Mapbox for our rendered maps. 

Hot start GPS
When you turn off your cycling computer after your ride it will remember your current location. When you turn it back on again, and if the Absolute Cycling One is still in the same location, it won't have to search for a GNSS signal. All you have to do is hop back on your bike and it will instantly start tracking your location. We call this feature Hot Start GPS and it'll make navigating through the start of your routes a lot smoother. 
Sound design
The Absolute Cycling One has a minimal built in sound indicator that you can turn on or off for your turn by turn navigation. It has auto-pause and auto-start functionality in case you're at a traffic light, when you start or stop an interval and of course, when you turn it on or off. 
 






 



 
Next generation processor
The Absolute Cycling One uses a next generation Ultra low-power processor that can easily display full color graphics and custom rendered maps without draining the battery before your ride is finished. This processor matches high speed processors used in high-end smartphones reducing load-time significantly. 
Power optimised software
We invested a lot of time and resources in our custom made software for our cycling computer. Our engineers and developers work hand-in-hand to create a system that gets the most out of our processor and other hardware without draining the battery.

Once every second (1hz) these cycling computers will try to capture multiple satellite signals and use them to locate its position. The problem here is that the computer needs to be in visible contact with the sky to make it accurate. This means that you may lose connection when cycling through a forest, a tunnel or near open waters. 

 
Current Situation (GNSS)
Every 3 seconds regular cycling computers take an average of your last location and use them to predict where you’re going. This usually results in unrealistic real-time tracking of your current location. You’re probably trying to push yourself to the limits, going as fast as you can, quickly turning these small tracking errors into a difference of multiple meters. This is why most cyclists connect external speed sensors to increase their accuracy. Unfortunately this adds weight, ruins aerodynamics and requires setup and calibration. 
What our technology does differently
By combining GNSS with a combination of sensors inside our cycling computer it’s able to track your position more often and more accurately. The sensors check your location 20 times a second. That’s 20 times faster than relying on GNSS alone. This means that even if you’re racing at high speeds the margin of error remains very small; within 2 meters. And if you lose satellite connection our dead-reckoning algorithm will keep calculating your position using just the sensors. Whether you’re cycling through a tunnel, a forrest or near open water.  
We call this APT: Absolute Positioning Technology.
 

 

For our proof of concept we did a testrun using an extremely accurate RTK measuring tool. It can track your location with an accuracy <1cm and will keep on working for a very long time after losing satellite connection.  You might be wondering: “why don’t you just implement that technology in the Absolute Cycling One?” Excellent question! The technology used for this test is extremely expensive (about €250.000) but more importantly; it would make your ride look something like this:

 

In this graph you see the €250.000 reference compared to the tracking done by a different expensive GPS-only measuring device. It uses Internet to increase its accuracy. The average mean margin of error is about 0.8 meters making it very accurate. You can see where the device lost satellite connection because it simply stopped measuring that part of the route. Another downside is that this technology requires a constant connection with the internet and it’s far too expensive to implement in a cycling computer. 

In this graph you see how the competitors accuracy compares to the reference created by the extremely expensive but accurate RTK measuring device. The competitors technology calculates a route based on measured GPS locations. Since it lost connection with a satellite a couple of times, these measurements are off by about 5 meters. That’s quite a distance, especially when you’re cycling at high speeds! Next up is our own Absolute Positioning Technology:

As you can see in this final graph, our Absolute Positioning Technology is off by about 0.75 meters. That’s less than the GPS technology that requires constant connection to the internet. More notable is the fact that it never skips a part of the route. Even if it loses satellite connection it uses its internal sensors to calculate your speed and location (amongst other data). Since it doesn’t need an internet connection it stays reliable, even in rural or harsh outdoor terrain. Our genius developers at Inspiro are working very hard to increase the accuracy even more before the crowdfunding campaign launches. 

 

During the Rush Hour pro race in Nijmegen (the Netherlands) we mounted the Absolute Cycling One prototype on the handlebars of five racers. Our goal was to measure speed using our Absolute Positioning Technology while also measuring heart rate and power using external sensors. In the visualisations below you'll see the Rush Hour route and the test results of one of our racers. 


 


 
The founder: Harm Giesen
Harm Giesen is an industrial product designer with a passion for cycling. He’s been working on the Absolute Cycling APT technology since 2015. Recently he joined forces with Maarten Tjallingii, Henk Berg, Remko Berg, John Vader and many more talented individuals who all share the same passion for cycling and will help bring the smartest cycling computer to life. 

 
Our designers: Valeur Designers
In the early development stages, Harm (the founder of Absolute Cycling) felt that a cycling computer should not only work perfectly, it should also look and feel amazing. You have to want to add it to your bike. Knowing Harm couldn’t do this alone, he made a bold move and contacted the designers known for their work for Bang & Olufsen: Valeur Designers. One phone call and a plane ticket later he was in their studio in Denmark. It turned out one of their lead-designers -Jens-Christian Møller- is an avid cyclist so he was eager to jump on board. 

 
Our developers: Inspiro
Inspiro specialises in ’embedded system engineering’ and the ‘internet of things’. They create the hardware and software for a broad range of companies, including Toyota. Currently a piece of their technology is installed in a satellite ‘floating’ behind the moon looking for evidence of the Big Bang. Not only are they the perfect partner for Absolute Cycling, they’re also incredibly inspiring to work with.

Wearing shoes alters the structure and function of the foot resulting in a weakened appendage that is almost unrecognizable compared to the robust, anti-fragile feet of our ancestors.Although standing desks have exploded in popularity and have a ton of health benefits, people are still wearing shoes all day and at worst standing on the smooth, hard floor or at best an unnaturally flat anti-fatigue mat.  This is bad.  Standing on Stoic is like taking your feet to the gym.  Barefoot is better.When barefoot, the 26 bones, 30 joints and more than 100 muscles, tendons and ligaments are free to move. The movement builds strength, mobility, flexibility and range of motion making you a more robust human. Honor your DNA and stand on Stoic.  Do your feet a favor.Before shoes, our ancestors were barefoot for 2 million years. Their daily lives were spent walking, running, squatting, kneeling and standing on highly varied, uneven terrain. People had wide toes, solid arches, and extremely strong feet that could handle any obstacle nature provided.   Our feet have it rough. Not only do they have to carry us around all day, but they also get shoved unnaturally into shoes, boots, and other modern forms of footwear that may look sweet, but come at a cost.  Massage improves circulation, stimulates muscles, reduces tension, and often eases pain. Benefits:         Use STOIC wherever you work   RewardsOPTION 1  OPTION 2    TimelineShippingWe have partnered with Shopify to handle all of our shipping and fulfillment. We fulfilled our previous campaign using Shopify and we considered it a huge success with packages going to dozens of countries with very few returned packages and minimal shipment errors.  During that campaign, we subsidized over $100,000 in backer shipping charges to help pitch in, and we are going to do help again this campaign. We will offer discounted shipping below our quoted shipping rate to all of our backers. We will not make any profit on shipping charges, and will in fact end up eating much of the true cost.Shipping will be charged after our Indiegogo campaign successfully ends in our post-campaign pledge manager called BackerKit. Using BackerKit, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order. We have included shipping estimates in the chart below. Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances. If you purchase multiple Stoic's then you will receive an even bigger discount off of shipping. Shipping cost remains the same across reward levels because Shopify's pricing tiers encompass the difference in weight between reward levels.Hey, we're monkii.This is our 4th Indiegogo campaign!We love launching new products here because we get passionate feedback from backers who believe in what we are doing.

<p>Ever wonder what’s causing that awful smell in your shaker? It’s bacteria crawling all over the inside of your bottle. <strong>That’s why we designed Bolde Bottle to be the world's first shaker using 100% hygienic kitchen grade stainless steel in the lid, mixer, and bottle.</strong> Stainless steel prevents the build up of bacteria on its surface, is easy to clean, and will not absorb or retain foul odors.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing Bolde: the most durable, stylish, and hygienic protein shaker ever. We're shaking up the shaker game one bottle at a time. 
Maximize your training and bring Bolde Bottle to life by Selecting a Perk.
 

 

 
 


 
 

 

Ever wonder what’s causing that awful smell in your shaker? It’s bacteria crawling all over the inside of your bottle. That’s why we designed Bolde Bottle to be the world's first shaker using 100% hygienic kitchen grade stainless steel in the lid, mixer, and bottle. Stainless steel prevents the build up of bacteria on its surface, is easy to clean, and will not absorb or retain foul odors.
 


 


 


 

Odor Proof. We tried every material we could think of. Nothing matches the bulletproof protection of stainless steel. 
 
 

 

Tired of the loud mixer ball? Bolde Bottle smoothly and effortlessly blends your drinks without the annoying rattle. Our patent pending removable silent system mixer has no moving parts, is easy to clean, and best of all: no sound.
 


 


 


 
 

 

Keep your drinks ice cold in and out of the gym. That sweaty condensation on the outside of your bottle won't be an issue now either. Bolde’s double walled vacuum insulation holds up to 20oz (591 ml) and ensures your drink stays cool and enjoyable for up to 15 hours.

 
 

 

Your workout schedule can vary and getting fuel when you need it is the most important part of a strong recovery. Bolde Bottle comes with an attachable compartment great for protein, supplements, snacks or anything else you need. Holds 2 heaping scoops (160cc) of protein. 

 

 
 

 

A food grade silicone cap provides you with an extra tight seal to ensure your shaker stays closed and your drink stays in your bottle. The easy open flip cap makes opening with one hand a breeze. 

 

Bolde Bottle's visual indicator lets you know exactly when your cap hits the closed position. Eliminate any accidental spills caused by half shut bottles. 

 

 

Traditional shakers require your hands to touch the spout in order to open the cap. The same hands that touched the gym equipment everyone else is using. Bolde’s Spout Shield Technology ensures no unwanted germs or anything else come in contact with your drinking spout. 

 
 

 


 

 
We embrace a buy it once, buy it for life mindset that maximizes quality to reduce waste.
 
Bolde Bottle is constructed with only the highest quality materials, making it the last shaker you'll ever need.
 

 
Bolde Bottle's lid, mixer, and body are constructed with 18/8 Pro Grade Stainless Steel. Comprised of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, it offers superior durability, corrosion resistance, and sanitary qualities. More importantly, and unlike plastic containers, no chemicals will leach into your drink. These qualities make it the preferred choice for professional kitchens all over the world.
Our snap cap seal is made of 100% food grade silicone. Silicone is made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and silicon, a durable quartz derivative found in sand.
By utilizing elements trusted by Mother Nature, Bolde is doing its part to shape an environmentally conscious future.
 
Top Tier Hygiene.
Bolde prevents the build up up bacteria, which keeps your shaker odor free. All materials are 100% BPA free, food grade certified, and will never affect the taste of your drink.  In addition to the materials used, features like Spout Shield Technology guard against unwanted germs coming in contact with your mouthpiece. We’re proud to say, Bolde Bottle is the most hygienic shaker ever built.

 
 

 

Over the years we’ve come to think of bottles as utilities with a single purpose. Such as a bottle for water or a shaker for mixing supplements. Bolde Bottle challenges the status quo by redefining what your shaker is capable of. 

 

 
 

 
We believe superior functionality shouldn't come at the expense of flawless aesthetics. We spent years refining our design and know that Bolde Bottle strikes the perfect balance of performance and style. With a minimalist look and feel, Bolde draws its inspiration from modern design. Every line and contour of the Bolde bottle is carefully crafted. 

 

 

 

Each element of the Bolde Bottle is custom designed.  There are no ""out of the box"" parts. Ready to pre-order? Select a Perk and upgrade your old protein shaker.",71.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm HIBIKI, an experienced female rope performer who has traveled around the world. About me: Over the last 18 years, I have visited more than 10 countries around the world giving bondage shows. I also host bondage workshops, I am a model at photoshoots and go to fashion shows. I have been interviewed by many magazines, and all of these thrilling experiences motivated me to improve as an entertainer. Back in Japan, I've been running two companies of my own for 16 years. I help produce shows for other performers, I run a bar showcasing bondage and burlesque shows in Nagoya, and of course I also perform at various other shows around Japan My life was really shining, before Corona came along... Now, taking advantage of my qualifications as a yoga instructor and NLP trainer, I recently devised a unique mix of rope and yoga which I'm excited to share with you!  My goal: I want to share with the world my new form of ""tied yoga"" that combines traditional Japanese rope tying, yoga, and pressure points. Corona has spread all over the world, and our lifestyle has changed dramatically. Always wearing a stuffy mask, always afraid to go out, and always wary of the risk of infection when interacting with loved ones. The development of vaccinations and the birth of new mutant strains are always cat-and-mouse and we don’t know when it will end. So, what should we do??? It is important to improve your autoimmunity and protect yourself. This ""tied yoga"" creates pressure on the knees and soles of the feet with Japanese rope bondage and is most effective in a short time. I have started this yoga class in Japan and I want people all over the world to know about this new type of yoga. Please watch my video to learn more about this technique! By participating in the campaign, you can help me to create an environment where we can provide workshops to people from various countries. Above all, I want people to know more about rope bondage, a hidden traditional technique in Japan that is also beneficial to health.  What We Need & What You Get The financial goal is 1,000,000 yen, which is about $10,000 (USD)  How this money will be used: Prepare Japanese rope suitable for tied yoga for 50 people 400,000 yen ($4,000) Production of video teaching materials 300,000 yen ($3,000) Preparing a studio space 300,000 yen ($3,000)  If we don't reach our goal, we will do as much as we can with the money we collect.  Benefits $ 10 a personal ""THANK YOU!"" email $ 30 Baku Yoga rope tying video $ 100 Baku Yoga Beginner tying video and video lesson for beginners $ 300 Baku Yoga Kit: Includes a tying video, lesson video for beginners and 4 dedicated ropes $ 1000 group lesson (in Japan)  $ 10,000 Private lessons and shows (domestic and international * transportation costs will be charged separately)  Impact 'Kaatsu' (pressure) training was popular in Japan in the past. However, although the effect was outstanding, it was a little tricky, adjusting with special equipment and having to go to a special gym.  With ""Baku Yoga"", if you have a rope, you don't need any other special equipment. Also, since it is fixed with a rope, there is no need to choose a fixed size - it can be fitted to people of any size. In addition, you can easily make fine adjustments by changing the position of the acupoints or loosening them a little according to your needs. There are more than 100 ways to be tied according to your physical condition on the day and any individual symptoms.  ・ By making knots on the soles of your feet, you can get the effect of reflexology while doing yoga. ・ The moment you untie the rope under pressure, blood flow improves at once, and abnormalities in cell, nerve, and hormone balance are improved. ・ Metabolism increases and weight loss becomes easier.  (Participating 6 times can reduce the average abdominal circumference by 5 cm) ・ Skin age is rejuvenated and skin troubles are improved. Everyone who tried “Baku Yoga” reported that their skin improved and saw less acne after a week. ・ By adjusting the autonomic nerves, 90% of people were released from insomnia troubles and their immunity improved.  In an era when you have to fight an invisible virus, learn Baku Yoga and boost your immunity as much as possible. I really appreciate your understanding and support. I hope that as many people as possible will be interested in this new yoga and that it will be transmitted from Japan around the world!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

It is equipped with inherently sanitizing gold and silver galvanic filters, face cooling technology, exhaled air filtration, and ""clear sound"" valves for phone calls. It’s comfortable, reusable, washable, and long-lasting. Magnetic connection. Adjustable curvature.  
  Silver has been used for millennia as a natural sterilizer. But it is the positively charged silver ions (Ag+) that possess the sanitizing effect! Pure 24K gold in Breeze triggers a galvanic reaction and an intensive emission of silver ions. We thoughtfully designed breathe out valves for Breeze. They are windproof and shaped to direct the sound of your voice directly to your phone in case you need to take a call while wearing a face mask. Breeze mask is created with ""human engineering"" in mind. We implemented zero-pressure ear-saving adjustable straps and an ergonomic nose arch. Breeze valves are equipped with N95/99 exhalation filters, paired with gold / silver reusable galvanic filters. Breeze gives the same filtration for exhaled and inhaled air while ensuring more comfortable breathing than the valve-less masks.Breeze is a glasses-friendly mask. Filtered exhaled air substantially reduces fogging up.Travel ban may be lifted soon, but wearing face masks became a new normal. While Breeze is not a medical device, it is  designed to filter air more effectively than most existing masks that are used in everyday life. All silver and gold filters in Breeze are washable and made to last. The outside shell is also washable and made from very durable polyester and polyamide  blend.  Breeze is compatible with widely available and inexpensive standard N95 filters.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hi! Nice to meet you. My name is Limor, and I'm a mother of two beautiful young kids. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When I first became a mom, I was shocked to learn that choking was a leading cause of death for kids under 14 in the US. Thousands of kids choke to death every year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>I couldn’t sleep at night.</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Listen to this:</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In a choking event, there is really no time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">After <strong>3 minutes</strong>, lasting brain damage becomes likely.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">After <strong>5 minutes</strong>, death becomes imminent!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Emergency services response time is 7 minutes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>They can almost never be there on time.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>I just couldn't live with that!</u></p>

For campaigns that have entered the InDemand program, contributors may request a refund from Indiegogo within 10 days of the contribution.</p>
<p><u>Contributions are eligible for a refund by Indiegogo, unless:</u></p>
<p> (a) the contribution funds have already been transferred to the Campaign Owner,</p>

<p>Here are the questions we get asked a lot:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is lifewand dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>lifewand generates the same vacuum as a manual pump used by paramedics, is FDA registered and is not considered dangerous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Where can I see your FDA registration?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>: You can see our FDA registration at the official FDA website: <a href=""https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfRL/rl.cfm?rid=225951"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfRL/rl.cfm?rid=225951</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What does FDA Registered mean?</p>
<p><b>Answer: </b>It means it is approved for sale in the US and that the manufacturing process and all the tests are strictly examined by the FDA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Can lifewand be used on adults as well?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: lifewand can be used on children and adults. Before we ship your lifewand to you, you will be able to choose a small mask (kids 1-6) a medium mask (kids 6-13) or a large mask (14 and up).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>Can lifewand be used on babies?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> lifewand can be used on children of 1 year old and upwards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the mask interchangeable?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Right now the masks are not interchangeable. There are 3 sizes you will be able to choose from before we ship lifewand to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is the lifewand is multi-use?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Yes</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Are there any studies done for the effectiveness of this product?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The device creates a vacuum that was tested in clinical trials and was found to be safe and effective. The device is ready and is registered by the FDA. However, in order for us to mass produce under a strict quality system required by the FDA, we initiated a crowdfunding campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>Why do I need this product when I can perform a Heimlich maneuver?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Heimlich maneuver can be a great solution. The problems with it are, that it not only requires training, and correct execution you have to remember when panicked (that can result in real damage if not done right), but also can be less than effective in situations where the choking person is bigger than you or is in a position that doesn't allow the right access.</p>
<p>lifewand was designed to be used by anyone, and in any situation. You don't have to be a paramedic to operate it. You can even use it on yourself! All you have to do is press lifewand against your child's mouth and nose and lifewand will do the rest. A pressure-sensitive mechanism activates lifewand as soon as it’s pressed against a child’s mouth and nose to create a powerful vacuum, that with swift action, pulls out any obstruction that may be lodged in the kid’s throat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Can your company guarantee that I will receive either a lifewand or a full refund?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>We are determined to achieve our goal of bringing lifewand to the world. In the event that this campaign does not achieve its target, we will supplement the required amount from the company’s investors and additional investors in order that every campaign purchaser will receive the devices purchased even if takes more time. We believe that providing such an important solution to this terrible problem is worth the time and money.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: When will I receive my lifewand?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Depending on your place in line, the speed of the funding, and subject to the strictest quality assurance and production standards, we hope to get lifewand to you in within a couple of months after this campaign is over.</p>

lifewand was built by a team of biomedical engineers, and it’s FDA registered.

You can see our FDA registration at the official FDA website: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfRL/rl.cfm?rid=225951

lifewand uses a spring-powered piston, to generate a powerful, but a harmless vacuum, that extracts any object that is lodged in the child’s throat.
Designed to be used by anyone, you don't have to be a paramedic to operate.
All you have to do is press lifewand against your child's mouth and nose. lifewand will do the rest.     

2 Simple Steps To Save a life:

Press lifewand against the child’s mouth and nose
lifewand will take care of the rest and remove the obstruction

Choking is real and it's killing thousands every year!
This is why you must have a lifewand device


 

Length closed: 23.7 cm / 9.3 inch
Length extended: 29.7 cm / 11.6 inch
Minimum width: 4.39 cm / 1.7 inch
Maximum width: 4.9 cm / 1.9 inch
Weight: 350 grams / 12.3 ounces

A choking event happens when you least expect it. In the panic and confusion, you need to know that your lifewand is nearby and ready to use.
With every lifewand, you receive a quick release stand which you can hang on any wall.

We want to make sure that in the case of choking, you don't have to think about it. Just reach out and grab lifewand.


lifewand was elegantly designed so that you can literally hang it anywhere. The quiet, soft-colored design of the stand and device, makes it unobtrusive so that it can easily fit in a kitchen, children’s room or public spaces like kindergartens and schools.
 


Doctor Judith Horowitz - Pediatrics & Adolescent Medic: “A device like lifewand in any household, can help save many lives”
 

Alona Assouline Polak: “I’ve been waiting for something like this for a long time. This is by far my biggest fear. Got one for me and one for my kid’s kindergarten.”
 

Adi Cohen - Paramedic: “In every case of choking I've handled, if, by the time I got there, they didn’t pull out the lodged object by themselves, it was too late to save the person.”
 

Gale Hoover - Daycare center manager: “Every kindergarten needs such a device”.
 

Lidor Beck: “As a combat medic, I think this device should be in every home and a public place. Better safe than sorry…”

<p><b>Why is SpineGym training better than other methods?</b> </p>
<p>Pilates is effective, but it can take years to master. <br/>Gym training can result in using only the superficial muscles. <br/>Exercise balls and ""planking"" may reach the core, but they can also be harmful to your back and joints, plus they are done in the wrong position: We use our core muscles in the standing position, not when lying or seated. That's why we should also train them while standing up.</p>

<p>With the poles behind your shoulders and the belt in front of you, arch your back against the tension of the poles. This is a great boost for your back muscles, similar, but much more efficient than the traditional back raise, done lying face down on the floor.</p>
<p>Adding a rowing motion of your arms, gives a good stretch and pump to the whole upper back, neck,- and shoulder area.</p>
<p>Twist your torso to ignite the rotator muscles.</p>
<p>Place yourself with the poles in front of your shoulders and the belt behind your back. Crunch forward to ignite the deep abs and to tense the six-pack. Adding a bit of twist to the movement activates the oblique abdominals too.</p>
<p>Do 20-30 reps of each movement and that's it! 
You have thoroughly trained your abs and back + activated the complete posture chain from your calves up to your neck and it didn't take even 5 minutes!</p>
<p>The carbon composite poles create always the right resistance for your moves. No uncomfortable positions, no sweating, no gym gear.</p>

<p><b>Will SpineGym change my bad posture?</b> What appears as lazy or unbalanced posture is usually a lack of muscle coordination and balance. This core muscle imbalance is the key reason for more than 70% of back problems. <br/></p>
<p>SpineGym training quickly balances this coordination. It activates the whole posture chain, resulting in an improved posture. </p>
<p><b>I'm an active trainer with a strong back, can I benefit from SpineGym?</b>SpineGym has proven to be a must-have tool even for top athletes. Think of the National Ballet of Finland ballerinas, probably not the weakest backs and cores? Yet, they start their rehearsals by warming up with SpineGyms. For the training aficionado and top athlete, SpineGym is a great tool to enhance core stability and midriff speed and strength. Runners, cyclists, golfers, dancers, hockey players, wherever good core balance and reaction is needed, SpineGym comes in.</p>

<p>""Many great innovations are born from the idea of a person simply trying to solve a personal problem. For SpineGym, this all began with Fredrik Serlachius and the prolapsed disc in his back. He was not satisfied with the painful and inefficient exercises that were indicated for his sore back. 

So Fredrik began to experiment with different techniques, with the idea of finding an efficient physical exercise system that could be performed simply, while standing up. </p>
<p>Fredrik had a strong hunch and he knew he was onto something especially thanks to his experience as a sports masseur. He was also a successful sportsman who had been 3 times junior national boxing champion in Finland. </p>
<p>Finally, the idea and core insight of SpineGym became clear to him.

 However, Fredrik first needed to test a prototype system for his idea. So he asked his wife to secure two angling rods to the sides of his body, using duct tape around his waist and ankles! Before her  bemused gaze, he then performed a series of thrusting movements with his pelvis. Eureka! There it was! He knew he had found his system! SpineGym was born!

 Thanks to his invention, Fredrik was soon joined in developing a finished product by back specialists and researchers from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, respected at a European level. That’s when I jumped on board, too!

<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>Timo and Fredrik examining one of the early prototypes made by Fredrik. 
Fortunately, the broomstick handles of this early model were discarded somewhere along the way!
</i></p>I'm an industrial designer and I was invited to join the development team, in light of my 20 years’ experience in designing sports equipment and medical appliances. That’s in fact why the simplicity and efficiency of SpineGym immediately made a very good impression upon me. <div>
<p>I had experienced a spinal disc problem myself during my university years and have suffered from a weak lower back ever since. I took a SpineGym prototype home with me and started to train with it for a few minutes in the evenings. I was not to become fully aware of SpineGym’s real power until two weeks later when I was working at a trade fair. That day, I was suddenly struck by the realization that I had been on my feet all day long without even noticing the effort. Before I had started with the exercises, I would only last a couple of 2 hours before having to sit down to rest my poorly, aching back! That was all the proof I needed to make me into the proud SpineGym man that I am today!

</p>
<p>No sooner did we get SpineGym into production and out on the market that it became a must-have-product for groundbreaking physiotherapists across Northern Europe. You can imagine that not before long, those professionals and researchers started to talk about the need to get a SpineGym out to everyday consumers for their independent, unsupervised use. These health professionals saw the huge potential impact: getting and keeping many people in good health with a system practical and easy to use whether in the home or the workplace.

</p>
<p>But before taking our product to a larger audience we had to improve on the first version that had been developed for use under the instruction and supervision of health professionals. 

</p>
<p>So, back to the drawing board we went! We wanted to keep the praised exercise method untouched and its main features identical. It had to be simple, 100% reliable and absolutely safe. We also set ourselves a new goal: a device that could be assembled and disassembled in less than a minute without using any tools and easy to carry around. After trying a few variants and prototypes, considering a series of different materials and producing an endless stream of design sketches, our new model was finally born. 

</p>
<p>We even took it one further step by offering two different versions to choose from: a standard model with modern styling and another one with a more classic Scandinavian look. We perfected both versions down to every possible detail, aiming to satisfy even the most demanding of customers.""</p>
<h1><b><br/></b></h1>
<h1><b>Patented innovation. </b></h1>
<p>Further evidence of the uniqueness of the SpineGym device and its training method comes from the world-wide patents that it has been granted.</p>

</div></div>","Strong back and abs for life
Did you know that 95% of all lower back pain can be prevented with correct exercise of the abdominal- and back muscles?Have you ever thought, that it would be great to stand up from your sofa or office chair and do some exercise for the good of your back and abs, but there is no easy method to do it right there, in couple of minutes?
That's precisely what The SpineGym has been designed to deliver. SpineGym allows you to perform an efficient exercise at home or office, whenever you want.





 SpineGym has an immediate effect on your posture, you will feel it already after your first exercise.  A good posture greatly affects your mood and your ability with everyday tasks. 





Enhance your posture, get rid of back pain and get that nice flat belly we all dream of.

Stronger abdominal- and back muscles already after two weeks of training. We have the research-backed data to prove it.
Exercise is done in normal clothing, no sweating, no difficult positions.
Standing exercises with small and safe movements makes SpineGym suitable also for the elderly or those suffering from back pain. 
The six-pack bonus: Heavy trainers know the efficiency of standing crunches. In SpineGym you do the same move, but with the waist support, the effect on your six-pack is much greater.












Why is SpineGym training better than other methods? 
Pilates is effective, but it can take years to master. Gym training can result in using only the superficial muscles. Exercise balls and ""planking"" may reach the core, but they can also be harmful to your back and joints, plus they are done in the wrong position: We use our core muscles in the standing position, not when lying or seated. That's why we should also train them while standing up.






















 How does it work?






With the poles behind your shoulders and the belt in front of you, arch your back against the tension of the poles. This is a great boost for your back muscles, similar, but much more efficient than the traditional back raise, done lying face down on the floor.
Adding a rowing motion of your arms, gives a good stretch and pump to the whole upper back, neck,- and shoulder area.
Twist your torso to ignite the rotator muscles.
Place yourself with the poles in front of your shoulders and the belt behind your back. Crunch forward to ignite the deep abs and to tense the six-pack. Adding a bit of twist to the movement activates the oblique abdominals too.
Do 20-30 reps of each movement and that's it! 
You have thoroughly trained your abs and back + activated the complete posture chain from your calves up to your neck and it didn't take even 5 minutes!
The carbon composite poles create always the right resistance for your moves. No uncomfortable positions, no sweating, no gym gear.

















Office job & healthy back, impossible? 
A few minutes training with SpineGym, even with a cup of coffee in your hand is enough to boost your muscles and posture. Experience of use of SpineGym at workplaces shows, that over 70% of the work-absences caused by back problems can be avoided with regular use of SpineGym.



























Tech Specs











SpineGym can be assembled and disassembled in less than a minute, without tools. It weighs only 5,1 kg (11,2 lbs). Comes with a robust carrying bag and an illustrated user's manual.3 year full warranty.














































Research backed results
We have spent the last few years optimizing SpineGym and its training
method. It has been thoroughly tested by the Faculty of Sport and
Health Sciences of University of Jyväskylä, Finland: a world-famous
research center.





Test on sedentary workers (age 35-60 years): 20 person test group of regular, sedentary workers, were given 2 weeks’ training with SpineGym, exercising only for 5
minutes per working day. These were the results based on EMG
measurements before and after the 2-week period:

an average 80% improvement in back muscle activation

an average 141% improvement in abdominal muscle activation

significant improvements in posture

significant improvements in abdominal muscle strength

90% of users found the training method from efficient to very efficient.







 
Test 2. SpineGym test on users of 70-90 years of age:
Test group performed 4-5 minutes of SpineGym exercises 3 times a week. Test duration 2 months. Average of the final test results:

Standing balance: 74% improvement
Walking speed: 41% improvement
Muscle strength and coordination (chair stand test): 58% improvement

Most of the improvement was achieved already after the first month of exercise.






Field tested reliability





SpineGym has been used and tested by the most demanding professional users we could find, and in the most challenging of environments on a daily basis. SpineGym has now passed all the practical tests we could think of, performing flawlessly in its stunning simplicity! Institutions such as the Finnish Army and Air Force, the Finnish Olympic Team, the National Ballets of Finland and Denmark are some of its happy users, just to give you an idea!






Will SpineGym change my bad posture? What appears as lazy or unbalanced posture is usually a lack of muscle coordination and balance. This core muscle imbalance is the key reason for more than 70% of back problems. 
SpineGym training quickly balances this coordination. It activates the whole posture chain, resulting in an improved posture. 
I'm an active trainer with a strong back, can I benefit from SpineGym?SpineGym has proven to be a must-have tool even for top athletes. Think of the National Ballet of Finland ballerinas, probably not the weakest backs and cores? Yet, they start their rehearsals by warming up with SpineGyms. For the training aficionado and top athlete, SpineGym is a great tool to enhance core stability and midriff speed and strength. Runners, cyclists, golfers, dancers, hockey players, wherever good core balance and reaction is needed, SpineGym comes in.











Can an older person use SpineGym? The new version of SpineGym is designed to be safe and easy to use for everyone, young and old equally. In fact it has been tested by people up to over 90 years old with extremely good results. 
SpineGym really is for everyone!
 
“You can feel the effect straight away. I would say excellent for older people who are not good with floor exercises. Hits the spot straight away, a good core workout for just a few minutes each day. I like it very much.”  Personal Trainer, UK

Excellent for prenatal

The background story, told by Timo Heino, the head developer of SpineGym.






 
""Many great innovations are born from the idea of a person simply trying to solve a personal problem. For SpineGym, this all began with Fredrik Serlachius and the prolapsed disc in his back. He was not satisfied with the painful and inefficient exercises that were indicated for his sore back. 

So Fredrik began to experiment with different techniques, with the idea of finding an efficient physical exercise system that could be performed simply, while standing up. 
Fredrik had a strong hunch and he knew he was onto something especially thanks to his experience as a sports masseur. He was also a successful sportsman who had been 3 times junior national boxing champion in Finland. 
Finally, the idea and core insight of SpineGym became clear to him.

 However, Fredrik first needed to test a prototype system for his idea. So he asked his wife to secure two angling rods to the sides of his body, using duct tape around his waist and ankles! Before her  bemused gaze, he then performed a series of thrusting movements with his pelvis. Eureka! There it was! He knew he had found his system! SpineGym was born!

 Thanks to his invention, Fredrik was soon joined in developing a finished product by back specialists and researchers from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, respected at a European level. That’s when I jumped on board, too! 







Timo and Fredrik examining one of the early prototypes made by Fredrik. 
Fortunately, the broomstick handles of this early model were discarded somewhere along the way!
I'm an industrial designer and I was invited to join the development team, in light of my 20 years’ experience in designing sports equipment and medical appliances. That’s in fact why the simplicity and efficiency of SpineGym immediately made a very good impression upon me. 
I had experienced a spinal disc problem myself during my university years and have suffered from a weak lower back ever since. I took a SpineGym prototype home with me and started to train with it for a few minutes in the evenings. I was not to become fully aware of SpineGym’s real power until two weeks later when I was working at a trade fair. That day, I was suddenly struck by the realization that I had been on my feet all day long without even noticing the effort. Before I had started with the exercises, I would only last a couple of 2 hours before having to sit down to rest my poorly, aching back! That was all the proof I needed to make me into the proud SpineGym man that I am today!


No sooner did we get SpineGym into production and out on the market that it became a must-have-product for groundbreaking physiotherapists across Northern Europe. You can imagine that not before long, those professionals and researchers started to talk about the need to get a SpineGym out to everyday consumers for their independent, unsupervised use. These health professionals saw the huge potential impact: getting and keeping many people in good health with a system practical and easy to use whether in the home or the workplace.


But before taking our product to a larger audience we had to improve on the first version that had been developed for use under the instruction and supervision of health professionals. 


So, back to the drawing board we went! We wanted to keep the praised exercise method untouched and its main features identical. It had to be simple, 100% reliable and absolutely safe. We also set ourselves a new goal: a device that could be assembled and disassembled in less than a minute without using any tools and easy to carry around. After trying a few variants and prototypes, considering a series of different materials and producing an endless stream of design sketches, our new model was finally born. 


We even took it one further step by offering two different versions to choose from: a standard model with modern styling and another one with a more classic Scandinavian look. We perfected both versions down to every possible detail, aiming to satisfy even the most demanding of customers.""

Patented innovation. 
Further evidence of the uniqueness of the SpineGym device and its training method comes from the world-wide patents that it has been granted.






Why Become a SpineGym Backer?
With your help, we now aim to make SpineGym available to anyone! To cover initial production cost we need a minimum number of orders. With potential users being everyday people like you and me, we can start to talk about production quantities that enable us to keep the price accessible even for this product, far more evolved and robust than its highly acclaimed predecessor.
In fact, we trust SpineGym so much that we have given it a full 3-year warranty.

<p>And, with anything great, there's a price: manufacturing and harnessing the manpower to develop even 100 units can be tough. Successfully launching this campaign and being fully funded would fix many hiccups. So, please, help us to get you more cobra bags!</p>

SpiderCore exercises are designed to have little to no impact on your neck and spine, and because the exercises are similar to swimming, you’re able to slowly stretch, build muscle, and strengthen your body without causing strain to your spine or joints. A strong core leads to a strong back.</p>

<p><i><strong>Comfortable, ergonomic sliders</strong></i></p>
<p>SpiderCore was developed by Dr. Ken Chang after a tennis accident left him in need of two back surgeries. The designs for the sliders are simple but effective - the palm sliders have grooves for your fingers to rest on to ensure that you are staying in control while doing the exercises. The knee sliders are made to ergonomically retain your knees while they move around during your workout. </p>

<p><i><strong>Natural, low-impact exercises</strong></i></p>

</div></div>","Say goodbye to sit ups and crunches. SpiderCore is the ultimate ergonomic, portable exercise equipment that trains your entire body through the power of your core-- with minimal stress to your neck and back.SpiderCore’s patented ergonomic-shape fits your palms and knees so you can glide comfortably across surfaces. Although the training is geared towards your core, along the way, you’ll find that your arms, back, and legs will all be pushed to their limits.By having the sliders in the palms and under your knees, you’re able to unlock a wide variety of exercises that give you the benefits of swimming but on land.With just 12 minutes a day, you’ll discover stability and strength in your core that you’ve never experienced before. You can use SpiderCore no matter what age or fitness level you’re at. Our creator, Dr. Kenneth Chang, used SpiderCore to rehabilitate himself from 2 back surgeries when he was 50 years old and now is in the best shape of his life by using SpiderCore every day (we’re both shocked and impressed at how shredded he is too!). 
Improve posture and reduce lower back painPoor posture from sitting at the computer all day leads to neck and lower back strain. But a strong, stable core reduces lower back pain and improves your posture, and SpiderCore lets you get in a full-body workout in the comfort of your home. So whether you work from home, livestream all day, or just love binging on Youtube, you can easily get your stretch and sweat on! 

Shred your core like never beforeApart from helping you look shredded in the latest #MotivationMonday photos, working out the core is important to maintaining balance and overall stability. No matter what you’re training for, having a strong core is fundamental to your success.The unique exercises designed for the SpiderCore sliders make it clear how your muscles are all connected to the abdominal and back muscles.Instead of spending time doing sets on sets of sit-ups and bicycle crunches, all athletes who add just twelve minutes of SpiderCore into their workout routines will see it pay dividends in hitting goals in other areas of training. If you want to compete with the best (or start looking like Dr. Ken), start with SpiderCore intermediate and advanced training programs. 
 
Add on low-impact exercises to strengthen your back and coreThe SpiderCore sliders were originally designed to recover from the negative effects of back surgery. Back injuries/surgeries and pregnancy can cause deterioration of muscles in the back and core. And physical therapy may not be enough depending on the level of damage. SpiderCore exercises are designed to have little to no impact on your neck and spine, and because the exercises are similar to swimming, you’re able to slowly stretch, build muscle, and strengthen your body without causing strain to your spine or joints. A strong core leads to a strong back.

SpiderCore is for everyone interested in seeing a dramatic improvement in their everyday quality of life. Whether it be preventing back pain from sitting for hours at a time or taking your game to the next level, SpiderCore brings functionality and strength to your life in a new way.
 
 SpiderCore sliders work as hard as you do. Because of how many repetitions you’ll be doing on the SpiderCore sliders, the goal was to create a product that was lightweight, durable, and long-lasting.So, each slider is equipped with a strong, durable plastic that won’t break on you—no matter what you put it through. On top of the plastic, we’ve opted for a durable foam that is basically indestructible (just like your core will be). Dr. Ken’s still using his set from 12 years ago!

Our sliders are one-size-fits-all and have two versions: one version for carpet and one for non-carpeted surfaces.
Things to Note:
The final shipped product will be a sleek, dark gray, not the prototype blue.You can choose from the regular slider, which is for carpeted surfaces, or the non-carpeted version which features a fabric cover so you can use it on hardwood, vinyl, tile, etc.
According to a study by Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute, nearly 65 million Americans have reported experiencing recent back pain, and back pain is the sixth most costly condition in America. A common remedy for back pain is doing some kind of core exercise, but a quick Google search of all the core exercises is overwhelming—which core exercises are the most effective? Enter SpiderCore.Working out your core is simple and effective with our included training program. SpiderCore allows you to get a full-body workout with exercises designed to target the core in every movement. Gone are the days when you had to deal with the monotony of hundreds of crunches for barely visible results - spend just twelve minutes a day with SpiderCore and let the results speak for themselves! 

Comfortable, ergonomic sliders
SpiderCore was developed by Dr. Ken Chang after a tennis accident left him in need of two back surgeries. The designs for the sliders are simple but effective - the palm sliders have grooves for your fingers to rest on to ensure that you are staying in control while doing the exercises. The knee sliders are made to ergonomically retain your knees while they move around during your workout. 


Natural, low-impact exercises
The exercises are inspired by the natural movements of strong animals like cheetahs and dolphins. When they move, they flex their spine and their core in a fluid and dynamic motion. This allows them to run with strength and agility and is extremely similar to how swimmers move in the water.
There are no machines, weights, bands, or strain to your back. SpiderCore is designed so that you have full control over the intensity of the workouts. And you can personalize the workouts to match your level of fitness and your exercise goals. All the exercises are multifunctional and cross functional. That means you’re working out multiple muscle groups with each exercise and you perform cardio, stretching, and strength training at once.It’s total body engagement that makes you functionally fit and more agile because you’re using your core to stretch your back naturally, safely, and comfortably.You'll get access to over 40+ SpiderCore training videos for free on Youtube that will guide you through beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts. We recognize that not everyone can just jump on an ab wheel and start training. (In fact, some of us have tried to do exactly this and failed!) This is why SpiderCore includes videos to guide you on your journey, with 36 exercise videos demonstrating proper posture and six 12-minute workouts you can follow along!1st Level - BeginnerThese movements are focused on mobility and stretch out your back. 2nd Level - IntermediateIntermediate involves pushups so it’s coordination, mobility, and strength training3rd Level - AdvancedOnce you’ve made it past intermediate, you can now consider your core advanced! We also plan to have different programs for you to advance through.

Studies show that getting enough sleep is key to building a strong immune system that can fight off infection. Yet new research shows that night after night, over 1/3 of American adults are not getting the sleep they need. Keeping a healthy sleep schedule can be tricky, especially in 2020.Amazfit ZenBuds are lightweight, noise-masking earbuds designed to help you get to sleep easily, the natural way. No pills, hours of meditating, or clunky white noise machines. Just comfortable, lightweight earbuds that lull your ears to sleep. And then keep you that way all night long. Using natural sounds engineered to help trigger the sleep cycle, Amazfit ZenBuds help mask outside noises that can keep you awake at night. With their skin-soft eartips, they help block outside noises like snoring dogs from disturbing you. Their snug fit helps prevent from falling out while you’re sleeping. Even if you toss and turn. Weighing 1.78g* each side, Amazfit ZenBuds provide such a feathery lightweight and are so comfy that you’d sleep feeling that they barely exist.*Each earpiece only weighs 1.78g when fitted with the medium bud.The eartips contribute to an elastic and stretchable texture. You won’t feel pressed or stuffed in your ears over the night. Their softness and flexibility make their replacement and cleaning so much more convenient. Simply stretch upon removal of the tips.The fin of the eartips securely embraces your ear ridge. Feel free to roll over, switch sides, or hog all the blankets for yourself. Don’t worry, they will still be there in the morning.Most people don’t realize this. But the average person has one ear slightly larger than the other. Amazfit ZenBuds come with four sizes of skin-soft silicone ear tips, designed to fit snugly in your ear and stay in place all night. So you can mix and match based on your ear size. The silicone eartips are thermal and sweat-proof, without causing pressure or discomfort. Make sure the right fit for your ears, where there's no probing effect in your ear canal and no worries about sticking in too deeply or falling out.They say silence is golden. But when a room is too quiet, everything can keep you awake at night. Old school earplugs try to fix this by plugging up your ear and blocking outside noise. But those rubbery eartips cannot block out so much, and always fall out when you stir. Research shows that when it comes to sleep, masking those sounds with natural, soothing white noise is far better than simply trying to block it out.Amazfit ZenBuds do both.The ""umbrella"" structure of the earbuds fits perfectly across your ear ridge, effectively lowering the noise level from external surroundings as well as soothing you to a better sleep state. Meanwhile, with the snug, comfortable ear tips, Amazfit ZenBuds are great at keeping out noise from the party next door or your bedmate rustling the sheets.But that’s only half the battle. The ZenBuds’ real magic comes from its massive library of sleep-inducing sounds, engineered to mask the unwanted noises that can keep you awake. So you can drift easily off to sleep. And stay there all night. They use a wide library of natural, sleep-inducing sounds to create soothing white noise that helps cancel out distracting sounds that can interrupt sleep. From bubbling brooks to serene forests.From chirping birds to ocean waves, these earbuds use curated sounds that trigger the sleep cycle and make sure you sleep easy, all night long. And receivers from trusted audio brand Knowles make sure you’re getting the best quality acoustics as you drift off to dreamland.Amazfit ZenBuds also come with a breathing exercise designed to help you relax and calm your mind after a busy day. So you can fall asleep easier, and sleep deeper when it’s time to rest. A fully charged pair of Amazfit ZenBuds can last for 12 hours* when using PLAYBACK DURATION mode. That includes using sleep and heart-rate monitoring all night long. So you get the best of both worlds — three hours of sounds engineered to help you sleep. And sleep insights that give you easy-to-use data on your sleep patterns. Or if you prefer to have them serenade you all night, switch to UNLIMITED DURATION for a full 8 hours of sleep-inducing sounds. That’s the recommended target for a good night’s sleep. So you can wake up well-rested and in the zone. Ready to be at your best. Looking for even longer sleep with Amazfit ZenBuds? The charging case can provide the earbuds with extra continuous playing time of about 56 hours*.*The above data is estimated battery time. Actual results may vary with each use. Set the Amazfit ZenBuds up in UNLIMITED DURATION so they can serenade you all night. Or switch to SMART PLAYBACK and they’ll pause playing automatically once they detect that you’ve fallen asleep.
UNLIMITED DURATION — Choose your sound, and let the Amazfit ZenBuds go all night, serenading you with sleep-inducing sounds engineered to help you sleep through the whole night.
PLAYBACK DURATION — You choose how long they play for - whether it’s 30 minutes, one hour, or four. Set your preference, and let the Amazfit ZenBuds carry you into a night of deep rest timed just the way you like it.
SMART PLAYBACK* — Once they detect that you’ve reached a deep level of sleep, they will automatically pause playing. This helps continue your sleep cycle in the most natural way possible.
 Every night when you sleep, your body creates a flurry of data about your health. When collected by the Amazfit ZenBuds, that data can be used to create a clear picture of your sleep patterns. The sleep earbuds monitor your heart rate, sleep positions, and the quality of your sleep. You’ll wake up each morning to insights that can help you create better habits. So you can get more out of your nights. And more out of your days.Everyone’s morning is different. And so is everyone’s alarm. Your custom Amazfit ZenBuds alarm goes off inside your ear, so it won’t disturb anyone else around you. And sound blocking eartips mean you won’t wake up to someone else’s alarm before you’re ready. Whether you’re sharing your bed, or catching some extra shut eye on the train to work. Wake up when you want to.Designed to block out distracting noises, Amazfit ZenBuds are your ideal partner in productivity. The earbuds help you use your time better and with the Pomodoro Timer (PT), allowing you to stay super focused for 25 minute stretches. Take a short break, and they will help you get right back in the zone by blocking out sound and playing the right sounds to keep you on track. Work smarter, not longer.The earbuds will make sure you won’t miss an incoming call in the midst of your “zen-zone”. They know when to interrupt, like your personal assistant.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Purifiers, at both ends of the price spectrum, all have high maintenance fees, generally costing <strong>over $500 </strong>on average every year. Whereas Airdog comes in at an impressive <strong>$0 Running Cost</strong> <strong>while being even more effective!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">HEPA Filters dispose of the tiniest particles down to PM 0.3, whereas Airdog’s <strong>TPA®️</strong> next-generation<strong> filter</strong> is <strong>600% greater </strong>in the particles that it can filter.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Airdog’s patented <strong>TPA® technology</strong> is the latest evolution in Air purifiers. It generates a high voltage electric field so that when <b>harmful particles</b> pass through that electrified ionic field, they are instantly <strong>destroyed</strong>. Any remnants are then absorbed by the collection plate.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The latest futuristic <strong>Graphene Material</strong>, which is applied in space technology, is at the heart of X3 and right at the leading edge of filtration technology.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The <strong>Graphene Material</strong> enables the Collecting Plate to be <strong>superconductive</strong>, making X3 the most effective filtration system on the market while being 200% <strong>lighter</strong>! This is a first for air purifiers!</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>TPA®</strong> creates an <strong>Ionic Field</strong> that zaps all harmful particles down to<strong> 0.0146µm </strong>(6 times smaller than other air purifiers). These zapped wastes then stick to the collecting plates like magnets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">X3 not only captures, but actually eliminates harmful particles, and with Airdog X3 we’ve achieved a filtration rate of<strong> 99.99% harmful particles, 99.99% PM 2.5, 99.0% formaldehyde &amp; VOCs,</strong> with the remaining particles being securely contained. </p>

Airdog’s patented TPA® technology is the latest evolution in Air purifiers. It generates a high voltage electric field to electrify particulates and destroy harmful particles when they pass through that electrified ionic field. 
This Space-age Technology allows X3 to actively collect particles 6 times smaller than other air purifiers!
Airdog ensures that clean air is the norm rather than a luxury. Its 3 layers of Washable Filters value equates to zero dollars in running cost while eliminating up to 99.9% of Harmful Particles, 99.9% of PM 2.5, and 99% of Chemical Toxins in the air it cleans.

Purifiers, at both ends of the price spectrum, all have high maintenance fees, generally costing over $500 on average every year. Whereas Airdog comes in at an impressive $0 Running Cost while being even more effective!
HEPA Filters dispose of the tiniest particles down to PM 0.3, whereas Airdog’s TPA®️ next-generation filter is 600% greater in the particles that it can filter.

 

Airdog’s patented TPA® technology is the latest evolution in Air purifiers. It generates a high voltage electric field so that when harmful particles pass through that electrified ionic field, they are instantly destroyed. Any remnants are then absorbed by the collection plate.

The latest futuristic Graphene Material, which is applied in space technology, is at the heart of X3 and right at the leading edge of filtration technology.

The Graphene Material enables the Collecting Plate to be superconductive, making X3 the most effective filtration system on the market while being 200% lighter! This is a first for air purifiers!


TPA® creates an Ionic Field that zaps all harmful particles down to 0.0146µm (6 times smaller than other air purifiers). These zapped wastes then stick to the collecting plates like magnets.
X3 not only captures, but actually eliminates harmful particles, and with Airdog X3 we’ve achieved a filtration rate of 99.99% harmful particles, 99.99% PM 2.5, 99.0% formaldehyde & VOCs, with the remaining particles being securely contained. 


The ionic field acts as a powerful magnet, attracting harmful particles, common allergens such as pollen, pet dander, and dust, and filtering them down to 0.0146 microns (6x smaller than other air purifiers’ filters). 


The most vital and expensive components of other air purifiers are the air filters and in order to remain effective, you need to replace these regularly which, in traditional purifiers can get very costly.  Airdog X3 is equipped with the World's First Washable Filter that is easy to wash and fast to dry. 
It is even dishwasher safe!

The space-age properties of the Graphene material makes X3 completely durable that perform consistently time after time.   

The X3 has little downtime even after washing the filters, the Graphene infused filter is Fast-drying that will dry within 20 minutes!


Data from professional, independent testing institutions


 

TPA®️ Filters purify a much wider range than the traditional HEPA filter - from particles down to 0.0146 microns to PM 2.5 (cigarette, exhaust, dust, pet danders), and bigger particles (pollen, pet hair). 



  

AirdogX3's TPA®️ filter works perfectly, even after thousands of hours of use as its CCM is rated as highly as P4. CCM is the measurement of effectiveness, that describes how much dirt a filter is able to collect.
Over the lifetime of the unit, X3 will save over $500/year of the replacement cost of filters. Meanwhile, the X3 filter merely needs to be washed for it to continue operating effectively for thousands of hours at a maintained 99% effectiveness. 

 


Also powerful are the unit’s revolutionary turbine rotation fans that suck the dirt and blow out clean air in huge volume, even though the unit itself is far quieter and smaller. Once again Airdog X3 shows off its enhanced performance!

Airdog’s advanced “3D Circulated Purification” fans are designed to distribute clean air to every corner of the room powerfully and consistently.
The super-compact, strong design of the fans makes the unit suitable for a space of 100-200 ft². In fact, it can even clean a 300 ft² living room in just 20 minutes! 

Although Airdog X3 has a super-strong airflow system, it is super quiet! Apart from feeling the benefits of fresher air, you won’t even know it’s there.
Check out the Sleep Mode to improve the quality of your sleep. It works at CADR 100 with almost no noise (UNDER 30 dB)!



Airdog X3 quietly takes care of you and your home, cleaning and purifying with its intelligent and intuitive space-age technology, all at the push of a button.  Airdog X3's ambient light reminds you of the air quality whilst quietly getting on with purifying the air around you.

Household chemicals, airborne harmful particles, and pollutants – all of which make us sneeze, irritate our airways, our skin, and sometimes cause more serious health conditions. Airdog X3 is filtering every harmful particle and micro allergen out of the air, taking them away from you and your loved ones. It also smells better as the high-tech filters remove annoying odors as well and it is just one button!


The complex process of air purification is made simple with the Airdog X3 user-friendly controls that operate digitally and remotely.
Whilst gently and consistently improving the air in your home or office, Airdog X3  keeps you informed of the status of the air around you throughout the entire day. Its smart data-storage function records important information so that you can control your environment with precision, adjusting it to suit your requirements.

It also acts as a night light with a body motion sensor so Airdog X3 will automatically turn lights off when you go to bed and turn lights on when you leave the bed to help you see in the dark. 

 

Be one of the first to bring Airdog X3 home.

By emitting extremely low frequencies associated with deep sleep, Braindex encourages your brain to replicate Delta brainwave rhythms, leading to better quality sleep. 

 
Be more productive at work
Mid-range beta waves dominate our concentration, by stimulating the same frequency, Braindex helps you achieve peak mental performance and stay sharp when you need it.

 
Relaxing your mind easily 
It's easy to feel a bit overwhelmed, especially these days. Braindex sends out Low beta brainwave frequency to help you calm down and enter a relaxed state of mind.

 
Say goodbye to your stress
Life can be stressful at times. Braindex can also deliver Gamma brainwave frequencies, proven to mitigate stress and mental pressure.

 
Prevent chronic illness 
Schumann Resonances (SmRS/SR) is called “earth’s heartbeat”, it plays an important role in regulating human’s circadian rhythms and lowering blood pressure.
Braindex SmRS stimulation program is linked to inhibiting PC9 and B16F10 cancer cell proliferation, helping to protect against fatal illnesses. 

 
Your AI-Powered health hub 
Powered by AI, Braindex learns and predicts your personal habits accurately, and delivers the best healthy routine in Auto mode.

Braindex automatically keeps tracking you remotely in real-time and delivers the right stimulation program that you want.

 

Braindex is an advanced form of brainwave entrainment, the process of encouraging your brainwaves by replicating and synchronizing the rhythm from external stimulations.
Braindex relies on extremely low electromagnetic field frequencies that travel through your extensive neural network to change and optimize your natural brainwave frequencies. The persistent rhythm of Braindex syncs with your own rhythmic brainwaves, assisting your brain in entering your preferred state of mind. 

 
Part of Tier I public research on Brainwave Stimulation Technology.
 
Brainwave Entrainment isn't new! In fact, it’s been proven effective in laboratory settings for nearly a century now.

Scientists have studied and learned that the brain can naturally synchronize its brainwave frequencies with the rhythm of periodic external stimulations.

Your enthusiasm and support are the motivation to push us forward and make the product better every day! Thank you all for the continuous support, now we are finally approaching the fulfillment stage, you will be able to receive your BP Doctor smartwatch soon!Despite hypertension being identified as a leading risk factor for stroke, heart attacks, kidney failure and even dementia, it can be difficult for patients to keep up with the need to constantly monitor their hypertension and adjust their medication accordingly. Therefore, constantly monitoring blood pressure via wearable devices is becoming a trend nowadays.So we created BP Doctor, a true wearable blood pressure monitoring solution in the form of a smartwatch. With the patented inflatable cuff design, powerful algorithm and high accuracy sensor, BP Doctor is capable of making tracking and managing your personal health easier than ever before.Using the BP Doctor is simple, quick, and definitely less painful than whatever the nurse does to you. It's the most convenient monitor that you simply wear on your wrist and you are always ready to go.To test you just press a button, hold your hand over your heart, and the cuff will automatically inflate and deflate on its own. When it’s done, you can see a reading of your blood pressure on the screen. If it’s in a healthy range, you’ll see a green circle. If your blood pressure is too high, the border will turn red.(1) To compare with traditional upper-arm oscillometric machines, BP Doctor has advantages in its size, portability, convenience, data volume, and monitoring frequency that traditional sphygmomanometer cannot assimilate.(2) And the other “wearable blood pressure smartwatch” on the market tend to provide an estimate of blood pressure through pulse readings (which is not accurate), but BP Doctor takes a more traditional, and accurate route - by miniaturizing the components for traditional oscillometric measurement, using an inflatable cuff within the watch band to take an accurate blood pressure reading. And that makes BP Doctor unique and pioneer in the industry.The design of BP Doctor involved more than 30 new patents relating to its miniaturised pumps, valves and chips, some of which are no larger than a grain of rice. By miniaturizing the components for traditional oscillometric measurement, BP Doctor is capable of using an inflatable cuff within the watch band to take an accurate blood pressure reading just like a regular upper-arm oscillometric machine found in a doctor's surgery.Underneath the strap is a cuff that inflates to measure systolic and diastolic pressure via the oscillometric method. Basically, it’s the same technique used at your doctor’s office where they strap and inflate a cuff on your arm, except much smaller. Basically, BP Doctor has no difference in measuring method and data accuracy compared to the traditional upper-arm medical blood pressure monitor. Except it's much smaller, convenient and comprehensive in use.Video of BP Doctor's built-in tech and how to useIn this video, we wanted to demonstrate how to use a BP Doctor to measure blood pressure. Also, we made a few comparisons with the traditional oscillometric monitor that is frequently used by clinics and hospitals. You can see the high-resolution results below if it's hard for you to recognize the vital sign reading in the video.

Result of the first measurement                                      BP Doctor    vs    Omron    Systolic Pressure -       130                        128Diastolic Pressure -       73                          73Heart Rate -                     63                          63
In the first test, we measured the sample's blood pressure and heart rate in a calm state (which is what we recommended) so you can see the difference between each result are just slightly different.

 
Result of the second measurement                                      BP Doctor    vs    Omron    Systolic Pressure -       145                        144Diastolic Pressure -       74                          69Heart Rate -                     83                          81
In the second test, Jonathan did some squats and push-ups to raise his heart rate (which reflects in results), so there is a small fluctuation in the data. but overall it's still very accurate.
In Conclusion - in both active and calm states, BP Doctor can measure blood pressure and heart rate accurately. However, we do recommend taking a blood pressure test under a calm state and follow the instruction carefully to hold the device up over heart, approximately five centimeters from your chest.When you consider that blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day, a single point of reading in a doctor's office or pharmacy doesn’t really reflect your overall health. Providing a way for people with hypertension to continuously, easily and accurately monitor how their lifestyle affects their readings, can impact so many lives. Instead of merely checking, we keep monitoring.
The data is then synced to our app, which gives you insightful reporting, including high pressure, low pressure, and pulse. You can store your data to track trends, and understand at what times your blood pressure rises or falls. This enables you to develop a treatment plan or check the treatment plan based on the current trend.Our APP also providing a way for people can easily and accurately monitor how their lifestyle affects their readings may change the rules of the game. Also it gives you the ability and information to change your heart health, your lifestyle, and your future. We're powering the movement with a comprehensive range of monitors. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the time difference between each successive heartbeat, also known as ""R-R intervals variation"". To put it simply, everyone's heartbeat rhythm changes with physical conditions, not as regular as a beat machine. For example, a person's resting heartbeat is about 60 beats per minute, but the interval between beats is actually different (ie, this time is 0.9 seconds apart, and then the next time can be 1.1 seconds apart, instead of a full second every time). By analyzing the differences when the heart beats each time and having timely access to health information, HRV can be used for stress recovery. Studies have shown that heart rate variability can detect coronary heart disease, hypertension, and heart failure. In particular, the prognosis of cardiovascular disease will continue and should be monitored. Controlling the changes in the heart may prevent the recurrence of deterioration.BP Doctor can estimate whether a person is under the risk of having sinus heart rate, arrhythmias or risk of other heart diseases from its heart rate variability (HRV) analysis through multiple dimensions for your health improvement and performance optimization.Wake up in the morning and review your HRV score with your BP Doctor smartwatch. Read the full details of the heart health index in the app. Determine your body’s readiness for fitness and optimize your fitness training intensity.Please Note: HRV analysis will only take place at night (from midnight to 7 am) to ensure data accuracy. Please note that HRV Add-on ($50) only available for the perk of BP Doctor PRO. In recent years, clinicians have become increasingly interested in measuring heart rate variability (HRV) for a variety of purposes. An elegant method to assess HRV is through Lorenz Plot Analysis — a two-dimensional scatter plot of successive intervals verses immediately preceding RR intervals.Read the SCIENCE BEHIND BP Doctor's Lorenz Plot AnalysisPart of the HRV analysis is a review of your daily heart rate.

In an age of so much tech advancements making our lives easier, it’s crazy to think that we’re still rubbing a string in between our teeth to clean them. But gum disease effects over half of Adult Americans, according to the Center for Disease Control. Cleaning between your teeth, where your toothbrush is missing, needs to be a top priority.</p><p>Plus, flossing isn't even proven to be the best way to clean between your teeth. There has to be a better way, especially since recent research states many people use floss incorrectly or not at all. The American Dental Association recommends cleaning between your teeth at least once a day as an important part of overall oral health.   </p><div data-id=""18462506""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1511380375/p1tpjwjflzvjazggrta3.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>ToothShower is different.

It’s easy to use and will fit right into your morning routine. Powered by the water in your shower, ToothShower cleans 100% of teeth surfaces, every nook and cranny of your teeth, not just 60% like the average brushing. Toothbrushing misses between your teeth where gum disease can start.    Let’s face it: no one likes to floss. In an age of so much tech advancements making our lives easier, it’s crazy to think that we’re still rubbing a string in between our teeth to clean them. But gum disease effects over half of Adult Americans, according to the Center for Disease Control. Cleaning between your teeth, where your toothbrush is missing, needs to be a top priority.Plus, flossing isn't even proven to be the best way to clean between your teeth. There has to be a better way, especially since recent research states many people use floss incorrectly or not at all. The American Dental Association recommends cleaning between your teeth at least once a day as an important part of overall oral health.   ToothShower is different. It’s an all-in-one oral care device that will revolutionize tooth care forever.  ToothShower uses the water pressure in your shower as a power source, so there are no plugs to trip over or batteries to charge. And because you’re already in the shower, there’s never any mess to clean up after. ToothShower has three different attachments for optimum oral care: an irrigating dual-headed toothbrush, an irrigating tip, and an irrigating gum massager.   The dual-headed toothbrush hits both the front and back and sides of your teeth simultaneously, so you won't miss cleaning the tongue side of your teeth.  With silicone bristles on the back of the brush head you can clean the chewing surfaces of your teeth. Go ahead and use the silicone bristles to brush your tongue too!  The irrigating tip flushes water between your teeth like a water flosser (only without the mess to clean-up). This works especially well for braces and to pinpoint spots that your toothbrush can’t reach.  Finally, the irrigating gum massager works with seven jets of water to stimulate important blood flow in your gums and remove debris from between your teeth.   This is a huge part of preventing and even healing gum disease. Just hold the massager up to your gum tissue and move from side to side. Our innovative, irrigating gum massager will save you time by flushing between all of your teeth in less than 10 seconds.  Use it in place of the irrigating tip or in conjunction.        Here's a short video going through the installation processShower-powered is what we are, no loud motors to wake others up in the morning. This All-in-One Oral Hygiene Innovation lacks nothing.Use the dial to turn the device on and choose a comfortable pressure setting. Whether you like warmer or colder water, you get to choose the water temperature that matches your personal comfort level by using your showers temperature dial.  Countertop Water flossers can be messy to use because water and bacteria get everywhere!  They tend to end up back under the countertop and never to see the light of day again.  Don’t worry about where the water goes since you are already in the shower!

<p>Brushing your teeth is a long and boring task. Dentists recommend brushing teeth after each meal and dedicating at least 3 minutes to it each time. It follows that through the course of your life you should spend more than 200 full days brushing your teeth! Your time is precious and should not be wasted! With Unico™ this will no longer be the case! The solution is given in simple mathematical operations: according to dentists, the time we have to spent on tooth-brushing is <b>180 seconds</b> --&gt; <b>5.62 seconds</b> for each of the thirty-two teeth we have --&gt; <b>1.87 seconds</b> for each of the three exposed surfaces of each tooth.</p>
<p>Thanks to its design, Unico ™ is able to clean all the exposed tooth surfaces at the same time, the result is that your mouth will be clean in just 1.87 seconds! We brought the total time up to 3 seconds just to give you an even more effective cleansing and to give you the time to at least quickly do your hair or spray on some perfume while you are using it.</p>

<p>With traditional toothbrushes, both manual and electric, the quality does not depend much on the type of toothbrush, as we have been accustomed to thinking over the years by media, but rather on the way it is performed and the time that you dedicate to it. The mouth unit <strong>is </strong><b>ergonomic and allow you to reach the exposed surfaces of the teeth and the interstices between one tooth and the next one</b> without damaging the enamel of the teeth and the gums.</p>

<p>Although the energy required in manual tooth-brushing is not high, it is still a very, very boring action to accomplish. The electric toothbrush solves only partially the problem since it is necessary to hold it and shake it in all directions to reach each exposed surface of each tooth. With Unico™ The problem is solved, the Power Unit is small and lightweight. In this way it will be light enough to be held in the mouth with a slight pressure <b>without using your hands</b>.</p>

</div><div> </div></div>","About

 
Unico™ smartbrush is the Oral Hygiene device  that can perform toothbrushing in just 3 seconds. 
 

 

 

 
Brushing your teeth is a long and boring task. Dentists recommend brushing teeth after each meal and dedicating at least 3 minutes to it each time. It follows that through the course of your life you should spend more than 200 full days brushing your teeth! Your time is precious and should not be wasted! With Unico™ this will no longer be the case! The solution is given in simple mathematical operations: according to dentists, the time we have to spent on tooth-brushing is 180 seconds --> 5.62 seconds for each of the thirty-two teeth we have --> 1.87 seconds for each of the three exposed surfaces of each tooth.
Thanks to its design, Unico ™ is able to clean all the exposed tooth surfaces at the same time, the result is that your mouth will be clean in just 1.87 seconds! We brought the total time up to 3 seconds just to give you an even more effective cleansing and to give you the time to at least quickly do your hair or spray on some perfume while you are using it.

 

 
With traditional toothbrushes, both manual and electric, the quality does not depend much on the type of toothbrush, as we have been accustomed to thinking over the years by media, but rather on the way it is performed and the time that you dedicate to it. The mouth unit is ergonomic and allow you to reach the exposed surfaces of the teeth and the interstices between one tooth and the next one without damaging the enamel of the teeth and the gums.
 


 
Although the energy required in manual tooth-brushing is not high, it is still a very, very boring action to accomplish. The electric toothbrush solves only partially the problem since it is necessary to hold it and shake it in all directions to reach each exposed surface of each tooth. With Unico™ The problem is solved, the Power Unit is small and lightweight. In this way it will be light enough to be held in the mouth with a slight pressure without using your hands.

 

 
From a technical standpoint, Unico™ Power Unit will mounts an electric motor suitably sized to give the many brushes the right scrubbing power. The ultimate generation rechargeable battery is made of lithium ion, it NEVER has to be replaced. Moreover, during its use, it guarantees reduced noise levels compared to a traditional electric toothbrush!
 

 
Thanks to the antibacterial silicone material with the right flexibility, the mouth unit of Unico™ fits comfortably into all the dental arches of both men and women.
Large size – for people over 170 cm (over 5ft 7in)
Medium size - for people from 155 cm to 170 cm (from 5ft 1in to 5ft 7in)

Extra Small size – for children from 125 cm to 139 cm (from 4ft 1in to 4ft 6in)

<p><strong>What Did Research &amp; Tests Say?</strong></p>
<p>Biocrystal® technology has a tested and proven relaxing effect on users. All tested physiological parameters (depth and rhythm of respiration, heart rate, muscle tension, skin conductivity,) showed a confirmed effect of reducing stress levels.</p>
<p>Tests and research of Biocrystal® showed strong influence towards improving body energy flow. Affecting to the movement of energy through the body, Biocrystal® technology creates unique and distinctive significant benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Scientifically Proven Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce Level of Stress</li>
<li>Provide Faster Relaxation</li>
<li>Reduce Muscle Tension</li>
<li>Increase Oxygen Level</li>
<li>Reduced Fatigue</li>
<li>Improved Body Energy Flow</li>
<li>Better Focus and Deeper Meditation</li>
<li>Helps Improve Your Sleep Quality</li>
<li>Decrease Impact of EMF (electromagnetic field)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Biocrystal® has obtained the Certificate of Energy Influence on Human Organism.</p>
<p><strong>How we tested</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to testing and confirming the effectiveness of Biocrystal ® powder, we were looking for the right method that will unequivocally ensure that Biocrystal ® powder has a strong relaxing effect on the user leading to stress reduction and mitigation of stress. The results of the measurements performed during the testing, undoubtedly show the ability of Biocrystal ® to further and faster relax, reduce muscle tension, increase oxygen absorption, and therefore act to reduce stress.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle activity</strong></p>
<p>Difference between BF and CF for muscle activity can be seen after 10 minutes of measurements. Its values in this period were lower for BF as they were more constant than those for CF, which gradually increased until 21:00 minutes when the difference between them was the greatest. Lower values for muscle activity typically mean higher relaxation.</p>
<p><strong>Skin conductance</strong></p>
<p>Difference between BF and CF is not so clear for the skin conductance, but statistical analysis nevertheless showed significant differences after 16 minutes of the measurements. Values for BF are generally lower in this period of measurements than those for CF, and this indicates higher relaxation for BF</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate</strong></p>
<p>Values for heart rate become lower for BF compared to CF after 8 minutes of measurements. Lower values for heart rate usually correlate with higher relaxation or with lower physical activity. Therefore, this goes in harmony with lower muscle activity by further indicating a higher relaxation.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature</strong></p>
<p>It increased much faster and achieved higher values for CF compared to BF. The BF demonstrated strong EMF protective effect.</p>
<p><strong>Respiration rate</strong></p>
<p>Difference between BF and CF was biggest in the middle of the measurements as it gradually decreased after 12 minutes towards the end. Higher respiration rate on the beginning is correlated with higher metabolic activity. It seems that BF induced some internal response in testees that increased oxygen consumption.</p>

Biocrystal® has obtained the Certificate of Energy Influence on Human Organism.
How we tested
When it comes to testing and confirming the effectiveness of Biocrystal ® powder, we were looking for the right method that will unequivocally ensure that Biocrystal ® powder has a strong relaxing effect on the user leading to stress reduction and mitigation of stress. The results of the measurements performed during the testing, undoubtedly show the ability of Biocrystal ® to further and faster relax, reduce muscle tension, increase oxygen absorption, and therefore act to reduce stress.
Muscle activity
Difference between BF and CF for muscle activity can be seen after 10 minutes of measurements. Its values in this period were lower for BF as they were more constant than those for CF, which gradually increased until 21:00 minutes when the difference between them was the greatest. Lower values for muscle activity typically mean higher relaxation.
Skin conductance
Difference between BF and CF is not so clear for the skin conductance, but statistical analysis nevertheless showed significant differences after 16 minutes of the measurements. Values for BF are generally lower in this period of measurements than those for CF, and this indicates higher relaxation for BF
Heart rate
Values for heart rate become lower for BF compared to CF after 8 minutes of measurements. Lower values for heart rate usually correlate with higher relaxation or with lower physical activity. Therefore, this goes in harmony with lower muscle activity by further indicating a higher relaxation.
Temperature
It increased much faster and achieved higher values for CF compared to BF. The BF demonstrated strong EMF protective effect.
Respiration rate
Difference between BF and CF was biggest in the middle of the measurements as it gradually decreased after 12 minutes towards the end. Higher respiration rate on the beginning is correlated with higher metabolic activity. It seems that BF induced some internal response in testees that increased oxygen consumption.

“The results of the research I conducted on effect of Biocrystal® show that, without any doubt, Biocrystal® users experience the greatest changes in bio potential as soon as 10 minutes after the beginning of use. The results have proven that all users experienced positive changes in the general state of the organism in that period and that the average improvement is 34.6%.""

<p>The SipaBoards Air is a world-class SUP with a revolutionary innovation: <b>self-inflation right before your eyes</b>. The compressor unit, which doubles as a standard fin box, is built in right where the inflation valve on a normal SUP would be. The rechargeable battery slides in and out, and then with a wave of your hand your board pumps up to the perfect pressure every time. <b>Let us do the hard work for you</b> - while you get ready for your session, stretch out, or simply enjoy the view.  </p>

<h1>Why Is This Revolutionary? </h1>
<p>SUP works out your whole body, especially core muscles and your cardiovascular system, and it's tons of fun to go paddling with friends in the great outdoors. Now wonder that <b>paddleboarding is one of the fastest-growing sports in the world</b>.</p>
<p>Pumping, though, in a word: SUCKS! The SipaBoards air saves you the <b>time and energy you’d rather be spending on the water</b>. </p>
<p>That's <b>all the benefits</b> of inflatable SUP (iSUP) technology with <b>none of the downsides</b>. </p>

<p>Self-Inflation </p>
<p>The heart of every SipaBoards Air is the <b>SipaAir compressor</b>, powered by a removable and rechargeable battery that slides right into its slot.  </p>

<p>The compressor is connected to our existing <b>SipaApp</b> via <b>Bluetooth technology</b>. It can display a pressure gauge on the paddleboarder’s smartphone, and you can also <b>track your paddling sessions</b>.

</div></div>","We know what you pumped last summer!
And we’re here to change that with a revolution in SUPing: self-inflating boards for the best paddling experience on earth. While everyone else is busy pumping, SipaBoards Air models have already entered production. We have the hottest entry-level board on the water in the SipaBoards NEO for the unbeatable price of price 640 USD. For more experienced paddlers there are also 3 other awesome models. Early shipping will be in spring 2017. Spread the word around the world: pumping is so last year!!!
But don't just take our word for it, look for yourself at what others have said: 
 
    


 The self-inflating standup paddleboarding revolution works like a dream come true: just slide in the rechargeable battery, swipe the magnetic switch, and watch as your SipaBoards Air pumps itself up in under 5 minutes. You'll be on the water all day every day.

The Innovation

The SipaBoards Air is a world-class SUP with a revolutionary innovation: self-inflation right before your eyes. The compressor unit, which doubles as a standard fin box, is built in right where the inflation valve on a normal SUP would be. The rechargeable battery slides in and out, and then with a wave of your hand your board pumps up to the perfect pressure every time. Let us do the hard work for you - while you get ready for your session, stretch out, or simply enjoy the view.  

So toss your clunky old hand-pump away and hit the water in style: with your SipaBoards Air. 

Why Is This Revolutionary? 
SUP works out your whole body, especially core muscles and your cardiovascular system, and it's tons of fun to go paddling with friends in the great outdoors. Now wonder that paddleboarding is one of the fastest-growing sports in the world.
Pumping, though, in a word: SUCKS! The SipaBoards air saves you the time and energy you’d rather be spending on the water. 
That's all the benefits of inflatable SUP (iSUP) technology with none of the downsides. 

 
 
The Cast of Characters 

 
  


You can get your SipaBoards Air in 4 beautiful varieties so your SUP experience is a true expression of your goals and desires as a paddleboarder. All models are made of the same ultra-durable drop-stitch technology: dual layer on the premium boards and single layer on the Neo, with reinforced rail sides. Of course they all feature SipaBoards’ patented, fully-integrated SipaAir compressor. The only difference between them is size, shape, and volume, depending entirely on your interests and paddling style:


 

 
The SipaBoards Neo is a fun and stylish entry-level board for lighter paddlers (up to 225lbs), with the absolute best deal on the market. It has a narrower shape and slimmer profile, making for a straighter line in the water with tons of maneuverability. The Neo is a world-class quality for every pocket.

Our All-Rounder is for paddlers of all ages and ability levels, as it's sturdy as a ship. Families and those who are into SUP for the fun of it will love this model, which works as well as a SUP as it does as a mobile diving board - endless summer fun.

The Cruiser is a faster model, based on the same shape as the original SipaBoards Drive line, for the adventurer who wants to get out on the water in minutes and keep paddling for hours. You will enjoy its straight lines and sleek shape, which cut through the chop and take you wherever your body powers you. 

Our Balance model is in perfect harmony and comes outfitted with an anchor and dedicated hook rings. You will take this board to find your favorite hidden spot and enjoy a moment of serenity, relying on its stability to support you as you do yoga or train your core muscles. 
All boards feature a 12-month warranty.
What's in the Box? 

 Tech Specs

 
 

 

  

 
Features
 

 
Self-Inflation 
The heart of every SipaBoards Air is the SipaAir compressor, powered by a removable and rechargeable battery that slides right into its slot.  
App 
The compressor is connected to our existing SipaApp via Bluetooth technology. It can display a pressure gauge on the paddleboarder’s smartphone, and you can also track your paddling sessions. We’re still developing the compressor’s smart functions and we are hoping to introduce an anti-theft alarm and board finder.
 
    
 
  
Simply activate the switch to start self-inflation. Our switch is magnetic so that the SipaAir compressor stays waterproof, with no external contacts. 
 
 
Board Bag 
Our awesome board bag not only your SipaBoard, but also a collapsible paddle and fin, as well as whatever else you need for your session. Toss it on your back and off you’ll go.
 
  
The board bag feels so comfortable on your shoulders that you can even throw it on your back when biking to your favorite body of water. 
 
  
Safety Leash
One more innovation will ease your few steps into the surf. Our safety leash has a dual purpose: to keep you and your board together on the water, but also as a shoulder strap for easy transport.
 
  
All our features are designed to streamline and speed up the pre-paddling process, to remove anything that would stop you from paddling, and to make paddleboarding exactly what it was meant to be: pure fun. Get out on the water faster, longer, and more often. 
Paddle
Don't have a paddle? Want one? Just add $150 to your perk. Our three-piece carbon-fiber paddle is light as a feather, sturdy as a rock, and fits right into the board bag. 
 
  
Timeline
Boards are already in production and will ship in August.
 
Development 
We came out in 2015 with a SUP that set the industry on fire, even winning the Red Dot Best of the Best award! You can check it out here. The SipaBoards Air is just a natural evolution of the R&D we've been up to for over 2 years now.

Check out a collage of pictures from our first year of testing and touring. 

Our solution is (obviously) water-tight, salt-water friendly, lightweight but extremely durable, easily rechargeable, and most of all - fun: a high-power compressor built right into your SUP with an integrated finbox. Killing all the birds with one stone!

When demoed our innovation at trade fairs like ISPO and Paddle Expo, the response was humbled amazement, as people shouted that we are, without a doubt, the future of inflatable stand up paddleboards (iSUP). 

 

We gained a ton of experience setting up production from our first crowdfunding campaign last year. Our product is made of hundreds of pieces developed in-house. Naturally we went through all sorts of teething problems to deliver an awesome product to our backers. We mastered tooling, molds, the manufacturing process, assembly, packaging, and shipping logistics.

Now that the boards from our second round of crowdsourcing are in production, we can't wait to send you your board.

So be one of the first people in the world to get your hands on a SipaBoards Air - the self-inflating iSUP of the future.
SipaBoards Team 

The team of paddlers, designers, developers, and outdoor enthusiasts that brought you the first generation of SipaBoards is back. Our new innovation is the next step in our mission to bring SUP to as many people as possible. As lovers of physical activity and the outdoors, our goal is not necessarily to make SUPing easier, but to make it easier to SUP.

<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<div>
<p>We've developed, launched, and delivered a successful Snore Circle Version 1.0 and 2.0. Based on the feedback from our existing customers - we believe that the Indiegogo platform is well suited to provide us with input and feedback for the third generation Snore Circle. We've answered all the improvements in our new design from the first and second generation, and are looking toward Indiegogo to help us create the perfect Snore Circle. With that in mind, some specifications may still change later in the campaign.</p>
<p>We estimate deliveries to begin in October/November 2016 and we will do our best to meet this deadline. If we encounter any delays, we will always make sure that we share this news with you.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Q: How long does it take to charge the battery? How long does the battery last when fully charged?</b></p>
<p>A: It takes about 2 hours to fully charge the battery, and when fully charged, the battery can last for 2 nights. We recommended charging it every day.</p>
<p><b>Q: How does SnoreCircle work?</b></p>
<p>A: Snoring is mainly caused by the vibration in the soft palate as a result of the relaxation that occurs in your throat muscles that keep the airway unobstructed. Our SnoreCircle precisely detects and identifies snoring sounds with the bone conduction and sound recognition technologies, and then intervenes physically with micro sounds and micro vibrations at 54 levels. When the intervention is successful, the soft tissue at the back of the throat will contract and tighten to open the airway wider, so that you breathe smoothly, and thus stop or diminish snoring.</p>
<p><b>Q: When will be the delivery?</b></p>
<p>A: In two weeks after the crowdfunding campaign ends, so when everything goes well, we will have the perks delivered in late October or early November. </p>
<p><b>Q: Is SnoreCircle harmful to the human body?</b></p>
<p>A: SnoreCircle does no harm to the human body because it is worn only during sleep time, it works automatically upon startup without the need to turn on Bluetooth, and it is made of ecologically sound silicon.</p>
<p><b>Q. How long is the warranty period?</b></p>
<p>A: 1 year.</p>
<p><b>Q. Where can I download the App?</b></p>
<p>A: iPhone users can go to the App Store and search for SnoreCircle. Android users can go to the Google play and search for SnoreCircle.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is it noisy? Could it wake me up?</b></p>
<p>A: It may take about 3 days for a small part of customers to adapt to SnoreCircle, and during this process, they may be woken up very occasionally. After this short period has elapsed, however, the customer will enjoy a good night sleep and feel refreshed in the morning.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is it a must for SnoreCircle to work with the app?</b></p>
<p>A: You can use SnoreCircle alone, which can work and store data on its own. To view the data, you need to download the SnoreCircle App and bind your product via Bluetooth for data synchronization.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can the SnoreCircle App run on all sorts of mobile phones?</b></p>
<p>A: iPhone 4S or later versions can download and run the app. Android 4.3 or later versions with the support of Bluetooth 4.0 can download and run the app.</p>
<p><b>Q: My question is not here. Who can I contact?</b></p>
<p>A: Send us a message at crowdfund@vvfly.cn and one of our Support Staff will assist you.</p>

After years of development, Tuwan’s advanced technology can detect your snores at a rate of over 90% (above the industry standard). Plus, it doesn’t require you to wear anything on your face whatsoever.The Tuwan pillow pad goes under your pillow, and the pad itself is completely electricity and radiation-free.  Its smart app also helps you track and measure your progress. TUWAN aims to offer you the pure snore-free sleep that you and your partner has been waiting for. (10,000+ hrs of real sleep data collected)(Reduced Snoring Volume with TUWAN)  (TUWAN compares with other common solutions) Snoring is caused by an obstruction of breath in your airway while you’re asleep. Especially when sleeping on your back, your muscles relax, and the soft tissue in your throat drops into your airway. The obstructed airflow makes a vibration that causes you to snore.    Your Tuwan pad is connected to a small electronic device called the “Bedsider” which you’ll keep on your bedside table. It can accurately detect over 90% of your snores during the night.  The Bedsider effectively detects your snores using its sophisticated patented algorithm. After detection, it signals the anti-snoring pad, which very precisely turns your head to the side by activating a silent pump that inflates and deflates 4 air bags inside the pad under your pillow.This gentle and precise movement stimulates the soft tissue obstructing your breath, enlarging your airway and reducing your snoring. Your snores stop, and you and your partner both sleep more soundly! (Click to see Tuwan Work Principle Video ) Because Tuwan’s smart technology exists inside the Bedsider, there is no electricity or radiation coming from the pad itself, making it ultra-safe.The pad inflates quietly at only 35 db, about the level of a whisper, because your uninterrupted sleep is our highest priority. All you need to do is insert your TUWAN anti-snore pillow pad into your favorite pillow and enjoy snore-free sleep for you and your partner!

The first action of REGLO is the ""Relief"".
It is simple and quick to experiment, and is a very important result for most people, as it produces a more serene general condition for everyday life.​
However, in the last three years, by monitoring and testing REGLO on hundreds of people, we have also verified other important results in the medium term. Using the glove during a night's rest, with the hand in a relaxed horizontal position, creates a gentle but lasting action over several consecutive hours, applying a healthy light  decompression of the carpal tunnel.​
This leads to improving the circulation of the various fluids and therefore the flow of nutrients and the disposal of toxins, with the result of promoting a faster and complete physiological recovery process.
 
That’s way REGLO is called
THE RECOVERY GLOVE
 
 

  Watch the video below to have an in-depth look on the REGLO glove:   The surface in contact with the skin of REGLO has been treated with a bacteriostatic product based on Silver chloride, an extremely safe and long-lasting substance.The bacteriostatic treatment has numerous advantages for this glove, including:
The freshness and hygiene of the fabrics even with washing at low temperatures.
Reduction of cleaning costs.
Increased useful life of the glove.
 How does it work?In the presence of humidity, the Silver ions are activated and generate a sequence of events that lead to the death of the bacterium:
Attack and destabilisation of the cell membrane.
Blocking of breathing and the passage of nutrients into the bacterium.
Alteration of the division mechanism and therefore blocking of reproduction.
    REGLO is a multipurpose glove created to protect the skin and hands during physical and non-physical activities.REGLO helps promote healthy stretching to the carpal tunnel - an effective hand exercise for people who use their hands a lot. There's not one type of REGLO user.Active, health-conscious individuals who can benefit include but are not limited to:​
Gym-goers (workouts, gymnastics, weights)
Cyclists
Tennis players
Golfers
Software programmers
Bloggers
Gamers
Musicians (piano, guitar, drums, violin, etc.)
Drivers
DIY crafters
Cooks
Gardeners
Teachers
Hairdressers

While our bottles are 100% recyclable plastic, our next step will be developing and transitioning to more innovative, environmentally-friendly alternatives.   Stop flushing your money down the toilet!Looking at the graph above, we are wiping out the competition in all categories. There is no other wet wipe on the market that is eco-friendly, natural, flushable, and offers more bang for your buck than TUSHÉ.  Every starter kit includes a dispenser, cleansing foam, wall attachment, and USB charging cable. After the campaign ends, you'll receive a survey that allows you to add more bottles of our cleansing foam to your order.       Our TUSHÉ dispensers are designed to be compact and versatile. Dispensers can be placed anywhere in the bathroom of your choosing. Our favorite location? Right next to the toilet paper for easier access.           Customs, Duty, and VAT charges: in some cases, international backers will be required to pay additional fees. As these are beyond our control, it will be the backer's responsibility to cover these fees once they have received the selected reward. Any questions regarding this additional charge should be addressed directly with the backer's customs office.        At TUSHÉ, we are a team of dreamers and entrepreneurs focused on making the world a better place. Our mission is to reduce and replace single-use plastic wet wipes. We can sh*t on wet wipes but it doesn't mean that they should be sh*tting on our planet! With your help, we can wipe the world clean! Touché ;)   For the last two years, our team has worked to bring you the perfect TUSHÉ. Our goal was to deliver a simple design that is visually appealing in any bathroom. We are so appreciative of our incredible production team for their help throughout the entire process. In addition to avoiding any harmful ingredients, we have implemented countless butt-wiping tests to ensure that our formula is 100% safe for daily use. We are excited to share TUSHÉ to the world and replace the outdated wet wipe FOREVER!",57.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/>Introducing the patent pending Flashe Gaming Glove - Four Key Components To Improve Your Performance<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545395032/u8c9qh3sgaa6gffn2zps.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/>Gaming Sleeve<br/> </h3>
<p><i><strong>The flashe Gaming Glove always come with a standard Gaming Sleeve.</strong></i></p>
<p>Compression sleeves have been used for a long time in many sports. The reason for this is that studies show that compression sleeves help with blood circulation, body temperature, reduced muscle stress and faster recovery. <strong>Better blood circulation and body temperature means that you can perform at your peak more frequently, and for longer periods of time; and reduced muscle stress and faster recovery means that you can have a long and healthy gaming career.​</strong></p>

<p>Flashe Gaming Group have developed Gaming Sleeves to improve longevity in gaming, and to increase performance. With all the benefits that the Flashe Gaming Sleeve provides, <strong><i>we believe that our gaming sleeve will be a key component to Esports and the every day gamer. ​</i></strong><br/> </p>
<h3>Design Gaming Sleeve - Better Quality and Beautiful Design<br/> </h3>
<p>The Flashe Gaming Glove always come with a <strong><i>standard black Gaming Sleeve.</i></strong> However, if you want to really stand out, with better quality and beautiful design, then the <i><strong>Design Gaming Sleeve</strong></i> is something for you. <br/> </p>
<p><strong><i>The Design Gaming Sleeve is made of polyester, which is the superior fiber when it comes to compression in general. </i></strong>The extra benefits of this fiber includes; better breathability, ability to regulate moisture, sweat wicking capabilities and extra comfort. The standard Gaming Sleeve is made of nylon, which also is a great material for compression sleeves, but not as good as the polyester fiber.</p>

<h3>Reduced Friction For Faster and Easier Movement<br/> </h3>
<p>It's been known for a long time in the gaming community that the discomfort you encounter with your underarm and wrist against the mousepad is a big problem. Many people in their early 20's suffer from injuries related to using a computer mouse, and perform worse because of the high friction, lack of stability, and the injuries that arise.</p>
<p><strong><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545395863/llmsxs7taw5hz8rac4rs.png"" src=""""/></i></strong></p>
<p>With the Flashe Gaming Glove you never have to worry about this problem again. The underside is completely covered with teflon, the same friction reducing material that you usually find on the underside of your computer mouse. This means that you can finally become one with your mouse and move it faster, easier and with more precision than ever before.</p>
<p><strong><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545395913/taxkw1ppn19hfvfog8to.png"" src=""""/></i></strong><br/> </p>
<h3>Optimal Angle Towards The Mouse<br/> </h3>
<p>Today’s typical use of a computer mouse does not provide you with a healthy angle for the wrist. This leads to poor mouse movement and in turn injuries. </p>
<p><strong><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545395960/dwxlt4u8haxkqlw6fadn.png"" src=""""/></i></strong><br/><br/>While looking for ways to solve this problem, we started researching, and observing studies to see what the optimal angle towards a gaming mouse is. Studies show that part of the reason that leads to injuries related to a computer mouse is the angle towards the mouse, and that we should strive to keep a straight arm in relation to the computer mouse. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545396081/wadd8rdargnsbttp5uf1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To ensure that people using the Flashe Gaming Glove achieves the correct incline towards the mouse, we decided to embedd an incline into the Gaming Glove. The result became an optimal angle towards the mouse, at all times.</p>

<h3>Rotation Support For Perfect Precision<br/> </h3>
<p>Never before has something similar to this been presented. <strong><i>Our rotation support will most likely change the way we think and operate with a computer mouse worldwide, not only in gaming, but in general computer usage. </i></strong></p>
<p>In gaming, precision is extremely important. With the present technology there is no tool to assist precision while playing computer games - until now. </p>

<h3>How everything started<br/> </h3>
<p>For as long as he can remember, Oskar ""Dodde"" Ödmark have played video games. While always trying to improve his gameplay, he started to realise that a key element to improved gameplay is <strong><i>precise mouse movement,</i></strong> and <strong><i>not getting injured. </i></strong>In 2014, he suffered from a <strong><i>shoulder injury</i></strong> related to movement with a computer mouse and took a break from gaming, with rehab training for almost 2 years. <br/> </p>
<p>Oskar played games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and World of Warcraft, but his most prominent game was <strong><i>League of Legends.</i></strong> In 2016 he started playing it again, and found himself, like a lot of people, <strong><i>being stuck in silver/gold rank for a long time.</i></strong> Once again, he felt the discomfort of his underarm and his wrist against the mousepad, and performed bad, while also feeling the shoulder injury coming back. In September 2016 he stopped playing and continued his studies in <strong><i>mechanical engineering,</i></strong> but didn't give up his dream to play games at a very high level. <br/> </p>
<p>After taking another break from gaming, Oskar started to look for a solution to solve the problems he was encountering. In February 2017 the idea was born, and combined with his studies, Oskar developed the first ever Flashe Gaming Glove. </p>

<p>After struggling for so many years with high friction and unstable movement, he finally became one with the mouse and started moving it with less effort and with a controlled movement. For the first time in many years, he didn't feel the stress on his shoulder that he usually would after long hours in front of the computer. <strong><i>Oskar knew that this was something that could potentially help millions of people around the globe, </i></strong>so he started creating CAD-designs for additional testing. After months of late hours after school, he finally came up with designs that highlighted the technical functions of the Flashe Gaming Glove. </p>

<p>Intrinsic muscles are like the motor oil of the body. They keep your joints aligned and moving smoothly. When intrinsic muscles inside the arch of the foot become weak or inactive, it causes the foot to become misshapen and painful. Since the foot is the foundation of the leg, problems can spread all the way up to your back.</p>

<h3>Do you want to be a part of the newest way to get fit AND get a great reward in the process?</h3>
<p>Hancock Fitness &amp; Mobile Gym needs you to help ""Make Fitness Mobile"". By donating to our Indiegogo Crowdfund Campaign, you will be able to tell people that you helped start this innovative new way to get fit in our area! Many people that we speak to LOVE the idea and can see the advantages of having the gym come to their home however, some cannot. To those who are wondering why we want to Make Fitness Mobile, here are a few points :</p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy, Safety and Security - We pull up to your home, you come out and work out for 50 minutes in our state of the art mini gym. Exercise privately while not worrying about people staring at you, bothering you or touching everything you are touching without it being cleaned first.</li>
<li>Convenience - We come to you! We will pull up in front of your home (or close by if we can't fit) which saves you time! No more sitting in traffic to get to the gym only to find it packed with people, nowhere to park and people on every machine adding more time away from home.</li>
<li>Opportunity - Help start a fitness revolution by helping us create opportunity for more people to get into better shape so they can live longer, healthier lives. People have to juggle multiple things these days and unfortunately most of the time, we put ""taking care of our health"" last on the list. Life is precious, our families are precious, we have to take care of our bodies to be around for our family as long as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like everything is going mobile these days for many different reasons however, the idea of starting Hancock Fitness &amp; Mobile Gym came to Travis Hancock out of a combination of life experience and the motivation to help people get into better shape so they can live longer and feel better as he does. In early 2020 Travis learned he had a heart condition that would have taken him down had he not been in shape. I am sad to say that we have already lost some friends in our early forties due to heart problems, these lives cut short to soon! We have ONE body, we have to take care of it and want to bring that opportunity to as many people as possible!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Because our Mobile Gym is a new idea around our area, it has been a bit difficult to get traditional funding...this is where you come in! </h3>
<p>Hancock Fitness needs a small boost of capital to go with the 40% of funds we currently have so we are reaching out to the Community for support! We need the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Down payments on the truck and trailer, our goal is $10,000 for the truck, $9,000 on the trailer, the generator and cooling system with installation will take up the remaining amount.</li>
<li>If you can donate $5, $10, $50 or $100 to help us start a fitness revolution, we have some super perks for you! We are also taking donations from our local community businesses that want to help bring this exciting, innovative way of getting fit to our community, for your business sponsorship, we will list your business on our ""Founding Business Supporter"" plaque and shout out 2 businesses a month on our social media for the first year! We want to partner with as many people and businesses as we can, to help as many people as we can to help each other out!</li>
<li>We strive to be different and we are especially excited about our $50 donation perk...for this amount, you will receive an Insulated Water Bottle called an ORB by Asobu with the Hancock Fitness logo on it. If you haven't seen it posted...you have GOT TO CHECK IT OUT! (personally tested and love it)</li>
<li>If for some reason we do not reach our goal, we will look at extending the campaign a bit longer or generating funds another way but we have faith in our community and in God to provide just what we need to kick this fitness revolution off and we want EVERYONE to be a part of it!</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact You Can Provide</h3>
<p>To many people have busy schedules and feel like it is impossible to get to the gym, to have time to put their health first so, Hancock Fitness &amp; Mobile Gym is going to Strive To Help You, Be A Better You, by cutting out the time it takes to get a 50 minute workout in 3x a week:</p>
<ul>
<li>By bringing the gym to you, you will be saving the time, energy and gas it takes to actually ""go to the gym"" 12 times a month.</li>
<li>Travis Hancock, Certified Personal Trainer, is already training clients and ready to offer personal training if you aren't sure about your fitness level and where to start, we will bring the gym to you for personal training for only the training fee.</li>
<li>Hancock Fitness &amp; Mobile Gym also plans to be set up in a central location in Joplin and Carthage 3 days a week so, you can also come to us. With a different price structure for this service we extend this exciting opportunity to even more people.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Hancock Fitness &amp; Mobile Gym is a new kind of gym, nobody is set up to do this around our area, we are prepared to take on the risk and face any challenge as it comes along. We have already had to develop different ways to generate capital since we are considered a ""Risk"" with this new idea of mobile fitness. Other ways we are qualified to take this new innovative idea on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Owner, Jennifer Hancock, has over 20 years of experience in a business office becoming proficient technology, accounting, human resources, payroll, customer service, sales and personal life experience (she also has the drive and commitment to make this thing happen).</li>
<li>Travis Hancock has spent the last 4 years learning different ways to get fit and has become a Certified Personal Trainer, he also has the CDL license required to bring the gym to you from previous driving positions, is very knowledgeable about how you can get fit even if  you have been out of a gym for a long time. Personal Training IS optional (encouragement is free).</li>

It’s not just any spoon—it’s the only spoon you will need to take your taste to the next level. With SpoonTEK, the possibilities are endless!</p><h3><strong>SpoonTEK Overview</strong></h3><p>The human tongue can process five flavors at once: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and savory. The taste receptors within the taste buds activate while eating so the senses take over. Ultimately, the brain determines the final perception of flavor and taste.</p><ul>
<li><p>Human perception of taste is largely influenced by other sensory systems, past experiences, and our hunger for food.</p></li>
<li><p>SpoonTEK uses mild electric current to excite the taste buds on your tongue, like they’ve never been stimulated before! </p></li>
<li><p>SpoonTEK science combines the power of advanced electronics with tongue sensory and the brain for a one-of-a-kind eating experience.</p></li>
</ul><h3><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></h3><p>SpoonTEK uses a new ion sensory technology, a first for eating utensils that combines <u><strong>electric stimulation</strong></u> and<u> <strong>tongue sensory</strong></u>. This emerging technology mildly excites the taste buds on your tongue for better eating experience. You feel the difference in taste immediately!  To accomplish this task, we use two electrodes (one on the handle and one in the spoon bowl), advanced circuitry, complex wiring between all connections, and a proprietary method for hermetically sealing in the electronics.  SpoonTEK is a high quality product built for performance and benefit.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602478352/vdudhnbqx5u3mc5w52nm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The original tongue map that defines specific flavor regions has been disproved by scientists in recent years.

You won’t feel it, but your taste buds will feel it. Try SpoonTEK for new taste experiences, new recipes for a healthier diet with less sugar &amp; salt, and a new appreciation for tongue sensory.

What might taste salty to some, might taste sweet to others. Some love spicy and some love sour. Everyone is different.

Widely known for launching groundbreaking consumer products, they are now aiming to give consumers a taste-altering way to eat foods like yogurt, ice cream, soup, and many other edibles with SpoonTEK.The built-in ion sensory technology mildly excites the taste buds on your tongue like they’ve never been stimulated before! The immediate results are enhanced flavor, heightened taste, and improved aftertaste. SpoonTEK Works Great With:SpoonTEK science combines the power of advanced electronics with tongue sensory and the brain for an amazing eating experience. It’s not just any spoon—it’s the only spoon you will need to take your taste to the next level. With SpoonTEK, the possibilities are endless!SpoonTEK OverviewThe human tongue can process five flavors at once: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and savory. The taste receptors within the taste buds activate while eating so the senses take over. Ultimately, the brain determines the final perception of flavor and taste.
Human perception of taste is largely influenced by other sensory systems, past experiences, and our hunger for food.
SpoonTEK uses mild electric current to excite the taste buds on your tongue, like they’ve never been stimulated before! 
SpoonTEK science combines the power of advanced electronics with tongue sensory and the brain for a one-of-a-kind eating experience.
How Does it Work?SpoonTEK uses a new ion sensory technology, a first for eating utensils that combines electric stimulation and tongue sensory. This emerging technology mildly excites the taste buds on your tongue for better eating experience. You feel the difference in taste immediately!  To accomplish this task, we use two electrodes (one on the handle and one in the spoon bowl), advanced circuitry, complex wiring between all connections, and a proprietary method for hermetically sealing in the electronics.  SpoonTEK is a high quality product built for performance and benefit.The original tongue map that defines specific flavor regions has been disproved by scientists in recent years. Now, the consensus is that all parts of the tongue can detect all flavors. SpoonTEK and Tongue Sensory, a match made in heaven!SpoonWORKSYou hold SpoonTEK normally with your finger making contact with the electrode on the handle. Food makes contact with the electrode in the spoon bowl. Time to eat! An LED light on the handle will glow to indicate that the SpoonTEK system is working and delivering a mild electric current that passes through the food you are eating. You won’t feel it, but your taste buds will feel it. Try SpoonTEK for new taste experiences, new recipes for a healthier diet with less sugar & salt, and a new appreciation for tongue sensory. Say goodbye to after-taste, say good-bye to bland boring foods, and say hello to your new best friend…SpoonTEK!SpoonTEK’s design is elegant, lightweight, made with high quality, food safe materials, and simple to use. SpoonForThoughtAs we go through life, we experience so many things for the first time. But eating, that’s not an experience, it’s the first thing we did when we were born and what we do every day to survive. Taste plays a big role in our lives. What might taste salty to some, might taste sweet to others. Some love spicy and some love sour. Everyone is different. And for the first time, with NO chemicals added, SpoonTEK will give you another “first"" experience of a lifetime. A relationship with your tongue that will make you say “wow” and “this is amazing”. With SpoonTEK, the possibilities are endless! Subscriber Testimonials

But have you ever thought about having one to prevent hair loss?</p> <p><strong>ZeroT Cap</strong> makes building a routine for hair care easy and effective.

<p>ZeroT’s <strong>Red Light (650nm)</strong> reaches deep into your scalp to increase blood flow by stimulating the cell’s mitochondria to produce more ATP energy. This push for microcirculation allows for more nutrients to reach your hair follicles, resulting in <strong>fuller and thicker hair</strong>.</p> <p>Its <strong>Blue Light (405nm) </strong>targets the surface of your scalp to clear bad oils and reduce inflammation. As the lights destroy porphyrins, this helps<strong> reduce acne and </strong><strong>dandruff</strong>.</p>

Your scalp is highly sensitive to heat, humidity, or pollution.</p> <p>ZeroT’s Blue Light provides extra care to ensure your scalp remains <strong>clean and clear</strong>. This treatment is especially helpful for people with oily skin types, since it <strong>prevents excess oil </strong>from building up.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>To test the effects of Blue Light, we measured the level of cleanliness on a scalp <strong>before and after</strong> a single 20-minute session of ZeroT.</p> <p>Although ZeroT was designed to see results over a long period of use, you can already see a <strong>clear difference</strong> in Relative Light Unit (RLU) before and after a single 20-minute session.</p> <p>As comparison, a clean hand is measured at 2,000 RLU.</p>

<p>ZeroT Cap offers 3 Light modes: Red Light, Blue Light, and Dual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Depending on what specific hair problems you have, you can switch up the mode to fit your needs. Each mode is a <strong>20-minute session</strong> and <strong>shuts off automatically </strong>after the time is up.</p> <p>After choosing a mode, you can also choose between <strong>3 levels of light intensity</strong> to build up your treatment as you desire. Start the first month with Level 1 and slowly work your way up!</p>

<p>When comparing ZeroT to other hair growth products, its contactless method of care remains the <strong>safest option</strong>. Supplements like serums or vitamins include chemicals that cause unwanted side-effects or pollute toxins to the environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ZeroT, on the other hand, is<strong> non-invasive and safe </strong>on the skin and body.</p>

<p>ZeroT Cap derives from an advanced cell-stimulating technology called <strong>Low-level Light Therapy.</strong> Although first used to test plant growth, the same technology has been altered and applied in many different fields.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We were inspired by LED face masks to create a user-friendly treatment for the hair as well. That’s how ZeroT was born!</p>

<p>Dr. Lee, a trusted dermatologist and alumni from the renown Seoul University, has been with us since ZeroT’s early development stages. He has helped us test and refine  ZeroT's technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his words (translated from Korean), “ZeroT is an effective method of hair treatment that you can easily use every day. Especially because there aren’t that many treatment options readily available for women, I believe this product will be useful for a lot of people.”</p>

<p>We all have different hair types and physical conditions. As a result, it’s hard to guarantee you’ll see definite results within a certain period of time. The results don’t just suddenly appear—they take patience and perseverance.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve brought ZeroT to Indiegogo. We believe that as early adapters, the Indiegogo community will be most receptive to this innovative technology. We know it works. We just need others to see for themselves that it does!</p>
<p>The reason we developed ZeroT is to provide a way for hair care to be done easily and cost-efficiently at home. Compared to how common of a problem hair loss is, the access to its treatment is limited and pricey. So we came up with a solution to make hair care a fun and easy routine.</p>
<p>We aim to get FDA-tested, refine features, and conduct various experiments as we acknowledge ZeroT’s technology isn’t well known in the general public.</p>

Build Your Care Routine with ZeroT
We all have a routine around things we care about. A routine for skincare, working out, and before going to bed. But have you ever thought about having one to prevent hair loss? ZeroT Cap makes building a routine for hair care easy and effective. Because the health of our hair should  be as important to maintain as all our other daily routines.


 

 

Hair loss isn't just about genetics. More than ever, we're all experiencing faster and greater hair problems thanks to some choices we voluntarily make. Styling, for one. But also our diet and stress levels play a large factor. We need to start taking better care of our hair NOW while we still have a full head of it. Because trying to reverse what’s already gone is a lost cause.
 
Like we always say,
too late is too late.


Compared to other hair growth hats/helmets out in the market, ZeroT Cap offers a comfortable and cost-effective solution. Make sure you grab those Early Birds while they last!


 

 
ZeroT Cap offers an extensive hair care with its two types of light: Red and Blue.

 Red Light: helps grow healthier and fuller hair follicles
 Blue Light: cleans the scalp's surface of unwanted oils
 Unlike most hair growth helmets or combs that only offer red light, ZeroT goes the extra mile by offering two different types of care.

 

 

 
ZeroT’s Red Light (650nm) reaches deep into your scalp to increase blood flow by stimulating the cell’s mitochondria to produce more ATP energy. This push for microcirculation allows for more nutrients to reach your hair follicles, resulting in fuller and thicker hair. Its Blue Light (405nm) targets the surface of your scalp to clear bad oils and reduce inflammation. As the lights destroy porphyrins, this helps reduce acne and dandruff.



The Red Light reaches deep below the surface of your scalp to hit the cells of your hair's roots.
 

Step 1: Hair thins and eventually falls due to lack of nutrient supplyStep 2: Red light stimulates blood flow to reach deep into hair folliclesStep 3: Hair follicles receive sufficient nutrients again and appear fuller in form
 

 
That is why only 20 minutes is needed in a day for the lights to effectively target below the hair follicles!
 

ZeroT’s lights are specifically placed to target the areas most prone to hair thinning and hair loss. They follow along the M-shaped hairline and crown of your head.

 

 

 
The biggest cause of scalp infection is germs. Your scalp is highly sensitive to heat, humidity, or pollution. ZeroT’s Blue Light provides extra care to ensure your scalp remains clean and clear. This treatment is especially helpful for people with oily skin types, since it prevents excess oil from building up.
 

 

 
To test the effects of Blue Light, we measured the level of cleanliness on a scalp before and after a single 20-minute session of ZeroT. Although ZeroT was designed to see results over a long period of use, you can already see a clear difference in Relative Light Unit (RLU) before and after a single 20-minute session. As comparison, a clean hand is measured at 2,000 RLU.
 


 

ZeroT Cap offers 3 Light modes: Red Light, Blue Light, and Dual.
 
Depending on what specific hair problems you have, you can switch up the mode to fit your needs. Each mode is a 20-minute session and shuts off automatically after the time is up. After choosing a mode, you can also choose between 3 levels of light intensity to build up your treatment as you desire. Start the first month with Level 1 and slowly work your way up!


 

 

 
Over the past 3 years, our team has become experts at building products for our head. They're all built in our headquarters in South Korea with the best quality materials.
 
Rest assured, we even test these LED sources on ourselves to ensure its safety. If you're interested in learning more about how LED lights are safe on the skin, you can click the banner below!
 

 

 

 

 
When comparing ZeroT to other hair growth products, its contactless method of care remains the safest option. Supplements like serums or vitamins include chemicals that cause unwanted side-effects or pollute toxins to the environment.
 
ZeroT, on the other hand, is non-invasive and safe on the skin and body.
 

 

 

The side of ZeroT’s cap is made of mesh, which allows free-flowing air to circulate through your hair and scalp. This also ensures you don’t feel any sense of overheating from the LED lights.
 

 
 
 

 

 

 
ZeroT Cap derives from an advanced cell-stimulating technology called Low-level Light Therapy. Although first used to test plant growth, the same technology has been altered and applied in many different fields.
 
We were inspired by LED face masks to create a user-friendly treatment for the hair as well. That’s how ZeroT was born!
 
Curious to know more about how this technology originated? Click the banner below to see the full article!
 

 

 

 

 
Dr. Lee, a trusted dermatologist and alumni from the renown Seoul University, has been with us since ZeroT’s early development stages. He has helped us test and refine  ZeroT's technology.
 
In his words (translated from Korean), “ZeroT is an effective method of hair treatment that you can easily use every day. Especially because there aren’t that many treatment options readily available for women, I believe this product will be useful for a lot of people.”
 


ZeroT offers a wide array of benefits that aren't available in similar hair growth helmets currently on the market. Super stylish, convenient, and affordable. What more could you want?

 

 

 

 
ZeroT's essential technology is in the LED insert, which can be used under its own black outer cap. But we’re giving you the option to switch up the look.
 
Place the slim LED insert under other hats of your choice. Not just baseball caps but beanies, bucket hats, fedoras—you name it!
 

See these Seoul Fashion Week models rock the look!
 
 

 
Most hair growth hats on the market are hard, plastic helmets that aren’t subtle or sleek in any way. Meanwhile, ZeroT Cap’s flexible PCB design allows the cap to be giving yet supportive on your head.
 

 
ZeroT's adjustable and flexible strap makes it easy to size perfectly! You will also choose between a Medium or Large size when you claim your perk.
 
 

 

 
We love efficiency. And we’re sure you do too.
 
ZeroT makes it easy to multitask with its automatic shutoff feature after a 20-minute session. It’s also completely wireless so you’re free to roam about and carry on your business while ZeroT takes care of treating your hair.
 
Slip it on anywhere, anytime and no one else will notice you’re actually getting your daily hair care routine done!
 

 
The LED insert has a small opening in the back that allows you to charge through a USB-C type cable. A quick 2 hour charge will last you 2 weeks of daily use!
 
It’ll flash red during its charge and turn green once it’s fully charged.

 


 


 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
We all have different hair types and physical conditions. As a result, it’s hard to guarantee you’ll see definite results within a certain period of time. The results don’t just suddenly appear—they take patience and perseverance.
That’s why we’ve brought ZeroT to Indiegogo. We believe that as early adapters, the Indiegogo community will be most receptive to this innovative technology. We know it works. We just need others to see for themselves that it does!
The reason we developed ZeroT is to provide a way for hair care to be done easily and cost-efficiently at home. Compared to how common of a problem hair loss is, the access to its treatment is limited and pricey. So we came up with a solution to make hair care a fun and easy routine.
We aim to get FDA-tested, refine features, and conduct various experiments as we acknowledge ZeroT’s technology isn’t well known in the general public.

<h3>
<br/>Resistance bands</h3>
<p><br/>Included in all FREESIXD packages are<strong> four resistance bands</strong> in two different tension levels (blue &amp; grey). Resistance bands help you do gym exercises - without needing a gym. They allow you to <strong>train every muscle group</strong>, are <strong>lightweight </strong>and thus <strong>super-portable</strong> and the <strong>chance of injury is less</strong> due to a lower amount of force on the joints as compared to weights.<br/> </p>

<p><br/>The black band or even stronger bands can also be purchased separately after the campaign. FREESIXD is also compatible with other type of resistance bands like round tube bands.</p>
<h3>
<br/><br/>How to adjust the resistance</h3>
<p><br/>There are two ways you can adjust the intensity of the exercises with FREESIXD and the bands.<br/><br/><strong>1) TWIST THE BAR</strong>: If you use the bar for squats, deadlifts or triceps press, twist the bar and roll-up the band. The band gets shorter and thus the resistance increases.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.pullup-dip.com/media/image/c0/a7/c0/55_GIF_05_WiderstandAufrollen_210107_BestQ.gif"" src=""""/></p>

Scope of delivery of All-IN Kit

FREESIXD is much more than just a sling trainer. It's basically a portable, full-body gym in a bag. Check out the two main differences compared to other sling trainers below. 1) HEIGHT ADJUSTABLE - The attachment of FREESIXD is not only fixed at the top, but is stepless height-adjustable, so you can adjust the buckle to your desired height and train from all possible angles.
  
FREESIXD vs. sling trainers 
2) FULL-BODY PORTABLE GYM - It's a combination of a sling trainer, resistance bands and an exercise bar which allows many more exercises and strength levels than a sling trainer.
 
 
 

FREESIXD is probably THE most versatile fitness device on the market. You can do over 100 exercises and it helps to build and tone muscle efficiently. Get stronger, fitter and lose weight without having to go to the gym.

FREESIXD offers you endless possibilities with over 100 different exercises for your upper and lower body, all in one device. It's basically a complete bodyweight training system that fits into a portable bag. Check out just a few possible exercises

Outdoor group workout with FREESIXD
 


Tired of sling trainers that can only be attached to just one height above your head? We were too! That's why we developed a stepless adjustable buckle with integrated loop which can be moved up and down on the ""superbelt"", so you can attach the sling straps or resistance bands to any height from bottom to top for full flexibility. ✅ Stepless adjustable for all possible exercises and body sizes and pull or push exercises
✅ Extra durable aluminium and patented design  


Two clamps ensure maximum hold so that the buckle does not move during exercises. 

Stepless adjustable buckle which can be moved on the superbelt
Training from all different angles and for every body size and exercise. Do rows with the high attachment, chest flies with the middle attachment or curls with the low attachment and enjoy full flexibility! 


Protective padding on the backside prevents any damage to doors at home or while in a hotel so you can fully focus on your workout.
 
Adjust the resistance accordingly
Attach the resistance bands to the hook, pass them through the upper or lower D-hook of the super belt and adjust the resistance continuously by moving the buckle up or down (see also more detailed in the video below under ""How to adjust the resistance"")

 

The nylon superbelt is plugged in within seconds into the adapters on the wall, tree or door, tighten it by hand and you are ready to go. It enables you to move the buckle up and down for all different heights. Isn't that cool? ;-)

 
How it works:
1) Plug the metal plate into the upper adapter.2) Plug the second metal plate into the lower adapter.3) Tighten the belt and you are ready to train!


How to plug in the superbelt within seconds 

Super durable steel adapter plates can be screwed to the wall (two plates) or attached to a tree or post (two plates) with the straps. Tighten the super belt between them and you have a fully height-adjustable sling and resistance trainer anywhere you want, indoors or outdoors!We made them white so they are not so conspicious.
 
Wall Mount

Can FREESIXD be attached on a stud wall?
If you have only a stud wall in your house and still want to install FREESIXD on it, then you can use an additional wooden plate which you fix between two studs. On that plate you can then attach the wall adapters. (see below) 

 
How to install FREESIXD on a stud wall
 
Outdoor Tree / Post Mount
For the outdoor installation you simply need the two padded outdoor adapters and tension straps to attach it to a tree or post. This allows you to train anywhere you want, in the backyard, park or even at the beach. Enjoy the beautiful weather and fresh air with an outdoor workout! 

Outdoor adapters plus tension straps (2,0 m / 78 in each)
 

 
FREESIXD can also be installed on any round or square post.

Do not want to or can not screw into the wall or want to work out when travelling in a hotel?No Problem! We thought of everything and developed a door attachment system which you can attach to any door within seconds.

Hint: if possible train from the side of the door where the door opens away from you or lock the door so it does not open.

FREESIXD combines the benefits of a sling trainer and resistance bands, which make your workout an amazing and fun experience. 

 
Two length adjustable sling straps for all different types of exercises. Use your bodyweight as resistance.

How to change the difficulty by adjusting your body angle

 

Resistance bands
Included in all FREESIXD packages are four resistance bands in two different tension levels (blue & grey). Resistance bands help you do gym exercises - without needing a gym. They allow you to train every muscle group, are lightweight and thus super-portable and the chance of injury is less due to a lower amount of force on the joints as compared to weights. 


Strength of resistance bands 

The black band or even stronger bands can also be purchased separately after the campaign. FREESIXD is also compatible with other type of resistance bands like round tube bands.

How to adjust the resistance
There are two ways you can adjust the intensity of the exercises with FREESIXD and the bands.1) TWIST THE BAR: If you use the bar for squats, deadlifts or triceps press, twist the bar and roll-up the band. The band gets shorter and thus the resistance increases.
Twist the bar and roll-up the resistance band for more resistance
 
2) ADJUST THE BUCKLE: This is best explained by watching the video below: 

 
Two handles with anti-slip rubber coating ensure a perfect grip for all kinds of exercises. 

 

 

The additional Trings are comparable to wooden gymnastic rings, but offer you three different grip positions. 


 

 
With the pluggable bar you can expand your workout and perform exercises such as squats, deadlifts, lat pull-down, triceps press or bar curls. Its compact design fits perfectly into the portable bag.

<p>Hi Potential Backers, </p>
<p>This is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamespaulpilande/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James Paul Pilande</a> an Architect and Director of <a href=""http://www.arid.com.sg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ARID Builders Pte Ltd</a> a Commercial Interior Design firm and developer of the <a href=""http://www.lumen-aire.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LumenAire</a>. </p>
<p>In February of this year at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, myself and the LumenAire team which includes <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheldon-ruiz-8422a59/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sheldon Ruiz</a>, Alex Deng, Nick Benlota and Rene Tierra hatched a plan to design and develop <strong>a novel pendant light fixture with an integrated UVC Air purifier function, </strong>it is a patent-pending device<b> </b>in partnership with <a href=""http://lumen-aire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Philips-TUV-Germicidal-Lamp-Oct-2019.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Philips TUV</a> and supported by <a href=""http://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Enterprise Singapore.</a> </p>
<p>Our objective is to provide the world with a Singapore product that is safe and effective in improving (IAQ) Indoor Air Quality to prevent individuals from acquiring or spreading airborne pathogens which include the dreaded coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  </p>
<p>The rationale for using a pendant light is it is a perfect fixture for a UVGi (Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation) device due to its elongated body profile that will provide an extended amount of UVC intensity and exposure time to destroy the nucleic acid in the microorganisms DNA disrupting their ability to perform vital cellular functions that cause infections and disease. </p>

<div>In partnership with <a href=""http://lumen-aire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Philips-TUV-Germicidal-Lamp-Oct-2019.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PHILIPS</a> as an OEM for UV lamps and drivers, the LumenAire is safe to use in occupied space because the UVC Light is shielded, which means it is enclosed in an Irradiation Chamber, therefore avoiding contact with the eyes and skin. It is hidden from sight so air disinfection is always being performed even without noticing it.</div>
<div>Our product is focused is to provide a much improved indoor air quality in which standard air purifiers equipped with HEPA filters cannot achieve. At present these devices can only filter dust, smoke, odor, dander, and other smaller particles but not airborne pathogens. </div>
<p>To know more about how it works, you can watch our short Youtube webinar about UVGi Air Disinfection.  </p>

In February of this year at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, myself and the LumenAire team which includes Sheldon Ruiz, Alex Deng, Nick Benlota and Rene Tierra hatched a plan to design and develop a novel pendant light fixture with an integrated UVC Air purifier function, it is a patent-pending device in partnership with Philips TUV and supported by Enterprise Singapore. 
Our objective is to provide the world with a Singapore product that is safe and effective in improving (IAQ) Indoor Air Quality to prevent individuals from acquiring or spreading airborne pathogens which include the dreaded coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  
The rationale for using a pendant light is it is a perfect fixture for a UVGi (Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation) device due to its elongated body profile that will provide an extended amount of UVC intensity and exposure time to destroy the nucleic acid in the microorganisms DNA disrupting their ability to perform vital cellular functions that cause infections and disease. 

 
In partnership with PHILIPS as an OEM for UV lamps and drivers, the LumenAire is safe to use in occupied space because the UVC Light is shielded, which means it is enclosed in an Irradiation Chamber, therefore avoiding contact with the eyes and skin. It is hidden from sight so air disinfection is always being performed even without noticing it.
Our product is focused is to provide a much improved indoor air quality in which standard air purifiers equipped with HEPA filters cannot achieve. At present these devices can only filter dust, smoke, odor, dander, and other smaller particles but not airborne pathogens. 
To know more about how it works, you can watch our short Youtube webinar about UVGi Air Disinfection.  

 

Campaign Theme ""Product with a Purpose"" 
Our tagline ""Prevention is Better than Cure"" signifies our dedication to helping prevent the spread of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 pandemic.
The LumenAire team believes that good indoor air quality is the key to controlling the spread of the coronavirus and with your donations & backing, we want to provide selected nursing homes, small community clinics, and childcare centers with the much-needed protection by installing our products to these facilities and provide a pre and post (IAQ) Indoor Air Quality audit conducted by an independent agency to monitor the effectivity of the device to create public awareness about the air disinfecting capabilities of UV light. 
  
""As Architects, we cannot make ventilators, masks, or even formulate a vaccine. Hence we aim to fight this pandemic the best way we know-how."" 
Your backing will come a long way!
With your support, we can fund the following activities,

To employ a team to negotiate, coordinate, and implement the roll-out of the LumenAire in selected nursing homes, small community clinics, and childcare centers in Singapore.
To produce the quantity of LumenAire products required in our pledge. (32 nos. pendant light purifiers and 30 nos. troffer light purifiers)
To Pay for contractors to install the LumenAire in these facilities.
To hire and conduct an independent IAQ audit using a third-party agency on selected facilities. (one per facility)
Lastly, to manufacture 100 nos. pendant light purifiers necessary to fulfill the discounted pre-selling pledge. 


Testing & Certification   
To make sure that our product is safe and effective, the first batch of our pendant light will be tested in a TUV-SUD facility in the first week of July 2020. Our test fees are supported by Enterprise Singapore EDG grant. 
We will be certifying the product for the following test.
Electrical Safety testing; https://www.tuvsud.com/en-sg/services/testing/electrical-safety-testing
CADR value testing; https://www.tuvsud.com/en-sg/services/testing/clean-air-delivery-rate-cadr-testing

<h2>INTRODUCING POWER GUM.</h2>
<p>Designed specifically to increase your performance and overall health, POWER GUM is a sugar free supplement that includes caffeine, Vitamin D, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12. Whether you're gaming, exercising, studying, working, or anywhere in-between, POWER GUM will give you the boost you need - and taste great while doing so.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>WHY GUM?</h2>
<p>Chewing gum delivers energy and nutrients faster than other methods through sublingual and buccal absorption. Our gum format also ensures that you can get your boost on the go, without having to carry around clunky shakers, powders, or buy overpriced coffee or energy drinks. Research also suggests that the physical act of chewing gum activates the brain and boosts mental focus.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>THE FORMULA.</h2>
<p>Studies have shown that around 40% of Americans are lacking Vitamin D or various B vitamins, so to us, pairing Vitamin D, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and a functional dose of caffeine was a no-brainer. On top of that, each piece of POWER GUM is dosed so that should you choose, you can safely chew multiple pieces per day, based off of the FDA's recommended daily values.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>ABOUT THE CREATOR.</h2>
<p>Having an applied sciences undergraduate degree and multiple years working as a full-time online content creator, POWER GUM creator Matt Morse (StaysafeTV) knows the importance of having a clean-burning and hard-hitting energy source that combines functionality, well-being, and performance. It was this concept that drove the development of POWER GUM, which utilizes a rapid-delivery chewable gum format and a vitamin infused caffeine formula to provide energy and mental clarity whenever you need it, wherever you need it.</p>

Once we reach our goal of $100,000 USD we will begin our production stage right away. The kit is completely compatible with the ICLO and the heads are interchangeable. At our goal the shaver will be up for rewards at 50% OFF! We are looking to start production on January 2021, a head with a compatible Gillette razor blade will also be added. ( 3D Concept of the developing model)  The Iclo is the world’s first interchangeable all-purpose 3 in 1 care product which will save your nightly routine for some extra time to yourself. The Kit comes with 3 interchangeable heads which hold its own unique purpose. With all the products in one place you don’t need to worry about finding each one on a busy day.  The following images are a functioning Mock Up Model. Final model product may vary.1The Toothbrush: Start your routine with the electronic toothbrush with up to supersonic speeds of 44,000 movements per minute. Above the standard of most devices, the Iclo will guarantee you fresh and healthier teeth. The toothbrush also come with a blue LED whitening feature which turns on while brushing your teeth to insure you of whiter teeth! Optimal time usage of 3 min for the best results.Leading Quality and Durability - The electric toothbrush head is made of genuine US Dupont steel caps for hygienic storage to maintain a dust-free toothbrush head. Charcoal Toothbrush - The charcoal brush is used in the toothbrush for brighter teeth. The fade in the charcoal will indicate when to change your brush.  Recommended to replace approximately every three months. Blue LED Whitener- the Iclo toothbrush is completely LED whitening functional so you can do it all at once! To use simply change the mode to ""B"" and turn on your device. Iclo comes with four toothbrush heads, and each toothbrush head has a color band, so a family of four can use it together or you can use it alone for up to one year.2The Cleanser: Switch on the cleansing brush for a deep-pore wash. Much more effective than using your hands the cleanser will reach deep in your skin to rid of dry skin. A soothing massage to go along with your routine to start your day. Optimal time usage of 3 min. The soft non-toxic silicon base is safe and effective on your skin. Creating foams twice as much as washing with your hands, the cleansing brush gently washes and massages your face with ease. The more pressure on you face just gently apply cleansing foam on the brush and rotate gently on your skin.3The Peeler: Finish off your routine with the peeler, to remove blackheads, whiteheads and acne. Use  professional skincare products right at your home! The peeler easily takes out acne with one push leading to a clear skin. With the supersonic speed to go along with the peeler, the process is fast and soothing all while clearing your skin. Optimal time usage of 3 min for the best results. Switch onto the peeler to finish your routine! The peeler vibrates at a speed of 44,000 times per minute while thoroughly extracting any black heads or excess skin from your face.  Easy home care at a low cost. Exfoliation of dead skin cells, sebum, and various wastes, for better absorption of the nutrients of cosmetics into the skin.(Use it for a short period of time, approximately 3 minutes and using it for a long time may cause pigmentation and dermatitis on the skin. It is more effective if you use a steam towel after you open the pores.)4

The UVC is set on a timer just enough to turn off by itself so you won't need to worry about wasting electricity.  Activate the UVC Sterilizer with a click of a button. The light will indicate that the UVC feature is working. After the process is complete the UVC light will automatically turn off.6Wireless Rechargeable Base: The ICLO is cordless and charges when placed on the base.

-Caution-
When using the peeling function for the first time, please start once a week and manage it two to three times a week.The principle is to release wastes from the pores by transmitting sonic vibrations to water particles attached to the skin surface.It's not irritating, but it's too tight, so please refrain from overusing it.

<p><b>E</b>veryone in our family has long hair. Including our Turkish Angora cat Marusya and our German Shepherd Frosty. Hair clogged bathroom drains was an ongoing problem. Strainers that are currently available on the market left much to be desired, so we went to the drawing board. We challenged ourselves to create a Strainer that would <b>catch every single hair, every single time we take a shower or bathe our animals.</b></p>
<p><b>I</b>mportant part of the challenge was to create a strainer that would be esthetically appealing and most importantly <b>very easy to clean and maintain</b>.  After about 3 months of trial and little error, TubShroom™ was born. We tested the prototype for several weeks and were so impressed with it, that we crafted and handed out a bunch of them to our friends and family members. The feedback was amazing. </p>

<b>U</b>nlike traditional strainers that go over the drain, TubShroom™ is designed to go directly inside the drain opening. The hair is being wrapped around the mid-cylinder, while the water still flows freely through multiple holes strategically located throughout the unit.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">O</b>ne of the great benefits of this design is that you don't see the hair until you pull the TubShroom™ out for cleaning. Cleaning could not be easier. All of the hair is in one place nicely wrapped around the cylinder and all you have to do is simply swipe it right off the TubShroom™ with a piece of paper towel. All it takes is one effortless move to get rid off the entire bunch of hair. No pulling or untangling. The hair is just as easy to remove if it's already dry. Try doing it with other strainers!<br/>

<p><b>M</b>ost, if not all other strainers are designed to go over the drain - resulting in hair build up as seen above. Untangling soapy hair from your strainer is probably the last thing you want to do after taking a nice shower. With TubShroom™ You'll never have to go through this unpleasant process again. </p>
<p><b>T</b>ubShroom™ fits directly inside the drain opening. All drain pipes are standard size - 1.5"" in diameter. No special installation is required. </p>

<p>As is the case with any product, shipping and manufacturing delays are always a possibility. We are committed to adhering strictly to our timelines and getting the TubShroom™ produced on schedule. We gave ourselves a couple of weeks of extra time just in case there's an unexpected delay. Should everything go as planned we will actually deliver earlier than promised.</p>
<p>Throughout the research and development process, we’ve experimented with many different designs in order to develop the perfect strainer. After an extensive process, we have created a functional prototype to our design specifications, which will help expedite the production process once TubShroom™ reaches its funding goal.</p>

Here's how TubShroom™ handles weeks(!) worth volume of hair. The water keeps flowing freely while the hair is stored inside the unit until cleanup. 


You'll look forward to cleaning your strainer! It literally takes seconds. Even if you don't remove the hair right after you take a shower! Wet or dry, hair comes right off. 


 Here's what we've been dealing with before we created TubShroom™


 And this...





Now you too have a chance to own a perfect solution to clogged drains. 

Please share this project with friends to help bring TubShroom™ to life. Thank you!



Everyone in our family has long hair. Including our Turkish Angora cat Marusya and our German Shepherd Frosty. Hair clogged bathroom drains was an ongoing problem. Strainers that are currently available on the market left much to be desired, so we went to the drawing board. We challenged ourselves to create a Strainer that would catch every single hair, every single time we take a shower or bathe our animals.
Important part of the challenge was to create a strainer that would be esthetically appealing and most importantly very easy to clean and maintain.  After about 3 months of trial and little error, TubShroom™ was born. We tested the prototype for several weeks and were so impressed with it, that we crafted and handed out a bunch of them to our friends and family members. The feedback was amazing. 

We had TubShroom™ tested with all types of hair imaginable. Results were more than satisfactory every time. 

Works great with dog and cat hair. Bathing a shedding furry friend can yield a ton of hair, but TubShroom™ handles it with ease.






After several hours at a local Hardware store, we figured out what raw materials we needed in order to put together our first hand crafted prototype. 
Time to work on the 2D drawings. We worked with some of the best designers in the industry. This was an amazing experience in itself.


We are huge fans of the History channel ""How it's made"", as well as Discovery channel ""Myth Busters"" series. While working on this project, we felt extremely proud of ourselves. Getting this done meant a lot to us. While working with the CAD designer. I actually considered a career change. This is a very creative and, on many levels, satisfying job. It's an art. Thank you Harald Rehberger for your help and expertise. It was a great pleasure working with you!
Slowly but surely, TubShroom™ is looking more and more like what we had imagined. 

Prototypes Have Arrived!



Got it! At last, the TubShroom™ is ready for production.




Unlike traditional strainers that go over the drain, TubShroom™ is designed to go directly inside the drain opening. The hair is being wrapped around the mid-cylinder, while the water still flows freely through multiple holes strategically located throughout the unit.


One of the great benefits of this design is that you don't see the hair until you pull the TubShroom™ out for cleaning. Cleaning could not be easier. All of the hair is in one place nicely wrapped around the cylinder and all you have to do is simply swipe it right off the TubShroom™ with a piece of paper towel. All it takes is one effortless move to get rid off the entire bunch of hair. No pulling or untangling. The hair is just as easy to remove if it's already dry. Try doing it with other strainers!




Your hair looks good on your head. Not in your tub. 

Most, if not all other strainers are designed to go over the drain - resulting in hair build up as seen above. Untangling soapy hair from your strainer is probably the last thing you want to do after taking a nice shower. With TubShroom™ You'll never have to go through this unpleasant process again. 
TubShroom™ fits directly inside the drain opening. All drain pipes are standard size - 1.5"" in diameter. No special installation is required. 
Please share this project with your friends and help us bring TubShroom™ to life. Thank you!
We want to Thank Everyone who made this project possible!

Risks and Challenges:
  
As is the case with any product, shipping and manufacturing delays are always a possibility. We are committed to adhering strictly to our timelines and getting the TubShroom™ produced on schedule. We gave ourselves a couple of weeks of extra time just in case there's an unexpected delay. Should everything go as planned we will actually deliver earlier than promised.
Throughout the research and development process, we’ve experimented with many different designs in order to develop the perfect strainer. After an extensive process, we have created a functional prototype to our design specifications, which will help expedite the production process once TubShroom™ reaches its funding goal.",18.0,0,"4 Campaigns

The mobile app gives them a real-time update of their vital signs and seizure recordsMedical Doctors’ Dashboard features: At Epilert we believe that technology can contribute to enhance doctors’ diagnosis accuracy and help them to give the most adapted treatment by capturing specific data and ensuring a continuous feed of information about patients’ health condition. The reason why we’ve developed EPIDOC a full epilepsy monitoring dashboard through which doctors can visual a large set of data:
Vital signs (heartbeat and temperature)
Neuronal activities changes
Seizures records
Sleeping time
Medication intake
More accurate data in order to improve diagnosis and medical treatment Epilert enables physicians to have exact information about their patients’ seizures, vital signs and daily habits. Therefore, physicians would be able to establish a better diagnosis and medical treatment and adjust it over time thanks to a continuous real-time data update.
Clear data visualization
Better identification of seizures causes
Reduce error of diagnosis
Better and personalized medical treatment
“It currently takes far too long for many patients to get an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment”. Neurologist Professor Graeme Jackson ""“After my first seizure, getting a proper diagnosis was actually really hard. I went to multiple GPs and got different scans done"" R.V suffered from seizures for years.""Source: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-29/epilepsy...                     At Epilert we aim to detect all kinds of seizures and even be able to predict them through artificial intelligence soon. At this stage Epilert’s bracelet can detect 3 types of seizures which are the most common ones:
Tonic seizures: muscle stiffness, rigidity
Clonic seizures: repetitive, jerking movements
Tonic-clonic seizures: Unconsciousness, convulsions, muscle rigidity
      Being able to detect all types of seizures is one of the reasons we’ve decided to launch this crowdfunding campaign. In fact, our ability to push further our R&D depends on financial challenges on one hand, and on the other hand, artificial intelligence systems need a large database of users to be more performant. The more patients use our bracelet, the more our artificial intelligence system will be able to detect more types of seizures like:
Absence seizures
Myoclonic seizures
Atonic seizures                   
Refinement, comfort, and robustness, 3 criteria that have guided our passionate product design teamwork when creating Epilert’s bracelet design. After conducting a lot of research on design ergonomics and going through several trials, Epilert’s bracelet design emerged
Elegant and minimalist design
Robust and resistant materials
Adjustable belt to fit all sizes 
Light and convenient  
Easy magnetic closure
The perfect design to ensure a continuous sensor to skin contactEpilert design is made to support the epilepsy detection system functioning by ensuring that all sensors are always in contact with the skin while ensuring a comfortable experience and good maintenance of the wrist.
An adjustable belt, +/- 40mm to be suitable to all sizes and genders
Magnetic closure to ensure good maintenance to the wrist
Curvy shapes of the sensors to enhance the contact surface with the skin
A personalized belt for kidsKids can be very cruel to each other especially at early ages. In fact, children suffering from epilepsy can be victims of very mean mockeries from their peers. Therefore, we wanted to make Epilert a cool accessory for them so they can feel comfortable and happy to wear itA bracelet that fits everyone, everywhereEpilert’s bracelet is designed to fit kids as well as adults, men, and women.Patients simply must wear it on their wrist, and they are always ready to go 5 color options and two types of fabrics to be suitable for all occasions.     List of mechanical components of the bracelet           Electromagnetic Safety Standards Epilert Bracelet was tested and certified for:

Who are we?Epilert is a growing start-up that designs and develops high-quality wearable devices for patients suffering from neurological disorders in order to support them in daily life and to ensure better and rapid access to medical care when needed.Epilert’s first bracelet is dedicated to patients with epilepsy. Therefore, people suffering from epilepsy can have a real understanding of their disease and feel safe and secure regarding the unpredictable seizures’ occurrence.Our storyOur story began in 2017 with a group of 3 talented friends from different academic backgrounds (engineering, economics, and medical studies) reunited by a strong willingness to help their friend’s little sister to live a fulfilled life despite her disease and to ensure peace of mind to her worried mom regarding her daughter’s unpredictable illness.They decided to put in common their knowledge in order to find an effective solution enabling all the family to be constantly informed about their little girl’s health and to be immediately alerted when a seizure occurs without being on her back all day long. Therefore, she can enjoy life as any of her peers, and always feels surrounded and supported by her beloved ones.Started then a long series of robust scientific research supervised by doctors, to design the finest epilepsy detection and monitoring device to be on market.An initiative of a group of people united by friendship and animated by the desire to make life easier for millions of patients with epilepsy gave birth to a bigger ambition to shape tomorrow’s medical care through cutting-edge technologies.The Great Team Behind Our SuccessFrom concept to prototype This was a very challenging phase for everybody in the team. It took us almost 3 years full of scientific research supervised by doctors and hard work to design and create our high-quality wearable device. We’ve been lucky with our own fund availability and have utilized that to move successfully from a concept to a fully working prototype overcoming all the challenges.They talk about us 
   
Amongst 332 startups tackling epilepsy in the world, we have been ranked amongst the top 5 by StartUs insights' innovation analysts. Read the article below for more detailshttps://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-gui... Our Partners and Achievements WHY CROWDFUNDING?Working prototypes are now available and clinical trials are currently running for around 7 to 8 months 
We have decided to launch a campaign on Indiegogo for 3 main reasons:
A need for financial resources to fulfill all testing and FDA clearance requirements. 
This campaign is an indicator of demand for our device. We hope you will find it as fulfilling as we have opted to and use the opportunity to pre-order at highly discounted prices. 
Our aim to predict seizures before they happen depends on how large our database would be. The more patients use our bracelet, the more our artificial intelligence system will be able to recognize different types of seizures at the earliest possible.
You may also want to support us by making a donation. Or if you can't pre-order the bracelet or are not able to donate to our campaign, but still, find that our device can change someone’s life, then we would love to hear you make some noise about our campaign. Share our Indiegogo page on your social media, or blog. Talk about EPILERT around you.

<h2><u>Unlock the Potential of the Concept2® Rower</u></h2>
<h3>We all love the Concept2 rowing machine, it's simply the best in the business for what it does.  <i>But what if it could do more? </i>
</h3>
<p>I'm Brad Gresham, inventor and founder of Rowdaptor.  As a former Navy SEAL, I worked hard to squeeze every ounce of capability from my equipment in order to stay at the top of my game.  </p>
<p>My approach to the Concept2 rower was no different.  It's a fantastic machine, but I knew there had to be a way to get more out of it.  Rowdaptor does just that.  Rowdaptor turns the Concept2 rower into a complete home gym, allowing the user to focus that smooth, low-impact resistance and isolate specific muscle groups.  <i><strong>10 new exercises can be performed; no modifications are needed to the machine, and the normal rowing motion is not impeded in any way. </strong></i></p>
<p>Rowdaptor's design allows for rapid engagement and disengagement, facilitating <i><strong>quick transitions from normal rowing to any alternate exercise, and back to normal rowing</strong></i>.  This provides for some crazy, high-intensity intervals unlike anything you've ever felt.  The smooth, low-impact resistance of the Concept2 is a serious asset in this context.  With the resistance focused on the concentric contraction of the muscles, blood flow is maximized.  And because the machine's output (felt as resistance) is proportional to the effort you put into it, you get built-in drop sets every time you use it.  You can use it as a simple warm up by going easy on the effort being put into the machine, methodically increasing blood flow to targeted muscle groups.  OR...you can attack it and easily destroy yourself with a soul crushing workout.  Either way, there's no worrying with changing a thing about how the machine is set up; it's all about what you pour into it.  </p>
<p>Here's the list of <i><strong>10 new exercises</strong></i> that Rowdaptor now allows you to perform on your Concept2 rower:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bicep curls</li>
<li>Reverse bicep curls</li>
<li>Upright rows/high pulls</li>
<li>Single-arm rows</li>
<li>Cross-body pulls</li>
<li>Front shoulder raises </li>
<li>Lateral shoulder raises</li>
<li>Goblet squats</li>
<li>Overhead presses</li>
<li>Single-arm overhead presses</li>
</ol>
<h3>Construction:<strong> </strong>
</h3>
<p>Rowdaptor is, and always will be, <i><strong>made in the USA!!</strong></i>  The device is CNC machined from 6061 billet aluminum and uses alloy steel hardware throughout. The foot plate is CNC routed from 3/4"" Baltic birch ply and coated with a durable, non-slip coating.  A nylon strap is attached to the foot plate, and includes an ultra-smooth Rollercam buckle.  The foot plate and strap assembly acts as a platform that connects to the rower to keep weight on the machine when the user is standing; that keeps everything on the ground when pulling vertically.  With very few moving parts, and nothing fancy to break off or malfunction, it's purpose-built for daily abuse.  Coming from someone who was paid to destroy things in pursuit of U.S. Government interests around the world, this thing is bomb-proof.  </p>
<h3>What Your Support Means: </h3>
<p>Rowdaptor's development has consumed the last 2 years of my life; I've poured my heart and soul (and bank account) into developing what I believe is the ultimate improvement to an already incredible machine.  I've gone through 7 design iterations and constructed 4 completely different prototypes to arrive at this final design.  It's finally ready, and I want to get it out into the wild.  Your support will be instrumental in making that a reality. </p>
<p>With my background from the SEAL Teams, it's not a stretch to understand that I've always been focused on human performance.  What isn't obvious is that I suffer with Multiple Sclerosis, and have done so for the past 9 years.  Having MS has taught me that I cannot take mobility and health for granted, and that I need 100% focus on what I refer to as ""<strong>health span</strong>.""  Health span is not simply living longer, but it's a focus on living an active, mobile and healthy life so that we are able to truly enjoy life with those that we love for as long as possible.  We need to support one another in developing our strength and mobility at all points in our lives.  <i><strong>I truly believe that Rowdaptor is one of those transformative devices that can safely and effectively aid in increasing our health span.</strong></i>  The low-impact, compound movements and cardiovascular benefits of rowing with the Concept2 rower are irrefutable.  Rowdaptor advances those benefits by leveraging that low-impact resistance for strength and mobility training for specific muscle groups.  The Concept2 rower outfitted with Rowdaptor is simply a magical combination of endurance, mobility and strength training for folks of all ages and abilities.  Supporting this campaign will serve to improve the health span of countless others by providing an easily accessible means to support their continued mobility and strength.  </p>
<h3>What Rowdaptor, LLC Needs &amp; What Your Support Will Get:</h3>
<p>My funding goal for the campaign is $50,000.  Your support will allow me to design and construct the required production fixtures and tooling; purchase raw materials, hardware, and packaging; and quickly transition to sustained production.  With this accomplished, Rowdaptor, LLC is off and running as a veteran-owned small business and, in my book, that's about as cool as it gets.  </p>
<p>The perks of this campaign are super simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can back us and get a complete Rowdaptor system from the initial production run</li>
<li> Back us with a generous donation to help get us off the ground  </li>
</ol>
<p>Or you can select both...then you'd be super awesome!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To be honest, the risks are extremely low at this point.  The design work and testing are complete.  I am testing a new finish for the foot plate, but that would be the only change from what you see here vs. production, with the exception of a minor cosmetic tweak.  Barring any totally unforeseen issues, and regardless of what happens with funding, everyone who supports us by selecting the Rowdaptor Perk <i><strong>WILL GET A ROWDAPTOR. </strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please pass the word and share this campaign with your friends, family and co-workers by using the sharing tools and social media.  If your gym uses Concept2 rowers, please provide the owner with a link to the campaign.  I truly appreciate the support, HOOYAH!!!</p>

With my background from the SEAL Teams, it's not a stretch to understand that I've always been focused on human performance.  What isn't obvious is that I suffer with Multiple Sclerosis, and have done so for the past 9 years.  Having MS has taught me that I cannot take mobility and health for granted, and that I need 100% focus on what I refer to as ""health span.""  Health span is not simply living longer, but it's a focus on living an active, mobile and healthy life so that we are able to truly enjoy life with those that we love for as long as possible.  We need to support one another in developing our strength and mobility at all points in our lives.  I truly believe that Rowdaptor is one of those transformative devices that can safely and effectively aid in increasing our health span.  The low-impact, compound movements and cardiovascular benefits of rowing with the Concept2 rower are irrefutable.  Rowdaptor advances those benefits by leveraging that low-impact resistance for strength and mobility training for specific muscle groups.  The Concept2 rower outfitted with Rowdaptor is simply a magical combination of endurance, mobility and strength training for folks of all ages and abilities.  Supporting this campaign will serve to improve the health span of countless others by providing an easily accessible means to support their continued mobility and strength.  
What Rowdaptor, LLC Needs & What Your Support Will Get:
My funding goal for the campaign is $50,000.  Your support will allow me to design and construct the required production fixtures and tooling; purchase raw materials, hardware, and packaging; and quickly transition to sustained production.  With this accomplished, Rowdaptor, LLC is off and running as a veteran-owned small business and, in my book, that's about as cool as it gets.  
The perks of this campaign are super simple:

You can back us and get a complete Rowdaptor system from the initial production run
 Back us with a generous donation to help get us off the ground  

Or you can select both...then you'd be super awesome!!

Risks & Challenges
To be honest, the risks are extremely low at this point.  The design work and testing are complete.  I am testing a new finish for the foot plate, but that would be the only change from what you see here vs. production, with the exception of a minor cosmetic tweak.  Barring any totally unforeseen issues, and regardless of what happens with funding, everyone who supports us by selecting the Rowdaptor Perk WILL GET A ROWDAPTOR. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Please pass the word and share this campaign with your friends, family and co-workers by using the sharing tools and social media.  If your gym uses Concept2 rowers, please provide the owner with a link to the campaign.  I truly appreciate the support, HOOYAH!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The degree° App guides you through treatment options and shows location based medical services Our Story - a turning point for technologyMy name is Greta Kreuzer. I am an innovations manager and mother of three. Together with my husband Johannes, who is a PhD medical engineer, we founded cosinuss°. We are developing first-in-class wearable sensors to monitor several relevant vital signs from inside the ear. Greta and Johannes Kreuzer, parents of three and founder of degree°One day our three year old daughter suffered from a viral infect causing high fever that sud­denly led to a febrile convulsion. I sat at her bed, taking the temperature every hour. But still I could not see the seizure coming. Later, I learned why: The reason for a febrile convulsion is not the absolute height of the temperature, but the fast rise of it.This incident didn´t let us rest. As we recognized that febrile convulsions are quite frequent and not just an incident in our family we put everything on finding a perfect solution for this problem. Parents should be enabled to see the whole temperature curve of their child during fever in order to be able to manage fever more relaxed and without stress. That´s why we created degree°.Our Kids are our inspiration. Our technology - benefit from our Expertise Continuous MeasurementBenefit from a continuous temperature monitoring by always seeing the temperature development with one glance. Know:
If your child´s body temperature is increasing or decreasing at any moment
The exact effects of your treatment
How long it takes until there is an effect.
When temperature is too high or rising too fast possibly indicating a febrile convulsion.
You do not have to estimate a temperature curve by connecting the dots of your one time measurements every one or two hours. You now have a steady and reliable temperature monitoring. In comparison to other temperature taking methodsdegree° is a major industry breakthrough giving you the confidence you need in times of fever. With degree° you can make decisions based on reliable data. Accuracy and ease of use are essential to a continuous monitoring of your child´s body temperature. With digital thermometers you can only take selective measurements. The results always differ and the procedure can be unpleasant depending on where you take the temperature.Using infrared thermometers you get various results with various handling depending on where the light hits the skin.degree° takes the temperature reliable from always the same spot which was validated in empiric studies. degree° is the thermometer giving you the core body temperature with a comfortable and steady quality. You can wear it 24/7 and be sure to be as accurate as ± 0.2°F (±0.1°C).degree° is a major industry breakthrough Why is degree taking the temperature from inside the ear?The body´s own temperature sensor, the hypothalamus, is located in the brain region near to the ear drum. Thus, taking the temperature from inside the ear canal will show you the same temperature than your body´s regulation system. Highest accuracydegree° is taking the temperature in the ear canal with a technical accuracy of ± 0.2°F (±0.1°C.) This measuring place is medically approved and is known to have the following normal temperature ranges: 97.7°F - 99.5°F (36.5°C - 37.5°C).State of the art components and best sensors on market combined with German quality engineering.  Battery LifeOur on-the go charging pod will automatically keep degree° always fully charged and safely stored. A thermometer luckily isn´t in use everyday. But it has to be ready at any time. Once you take degree° out of it´s box it´s battery life is 5+ days. Which means during a common fever you only have to put on the device once, and do not have to worry about runnning out of energy - literally ;) Technical Specificationsdegree° is an extreme lightweight but also durable and very cool device. degree° is hiding hardware of highest quality inside an overall size of only 1.6 x 1.6 inches (4x4 cm) and a weight of 0.18 oz. (5,4 grams). The world´s smallest and lightest wearable fever thermometer. Data Transmission with lowest radiation possibledegree° is recording all the data on the device itself without transmitting any data. Values are only sent to your smartphone on demand. Setting a certain threshold for getting a temperature alarm, there only will be one single moment where data will be transmitted. Using Bluetooth Low Energy and sending small compressed data packages only on demand, degree° is as low on radiation as possible. Prototype Functionality The Team - degree° is nothing without them.United we deliver to you a design that immerses you in the comforting feeling of being able to know when your child needs you most.

This is a major industry breakthrough that will make the life of parents easier, reducing uncertainty and stress especially during the nights.cosinuss° - an award winning companyThe Munich based company, cosinuss°, developed the technology that is used in degree°. A technology that is also in use in the medical sector. With degree°, this technology will be available for home use.Selection of awards of cosinuss° - the company behind degree°. Partner in ScienceWe’ve spent thousands of hours working with world-class universities, respected medical centers and health-tech designers to develop the very best and most comfortable continuously measuring fever thermometer.The underlying technology of degree° is a.o. already in use in a preemptive pediatric clinic, during heart surgeries and in an Allied Health Center and Body Temperature and Fluid Lab.Selection of partners who helped researching and studying body temperature.Example: German Heart Center, Munich. Evaluation study comparing different methods for taking the temperature during heart surgery.During a heart surgery the human body needs to be cooled down very low. This must be monitored very accurate. degree° is not only staying closest to the gold standard (pulmonalis), but is also the only non-invasive method for continuous monitoring. Our origin - pioneering mobile monitoringPrevious success of cosinuss° came with the cosinuss° One - the predecessor of degree°. A wearable In-ear vital sign monitor used in professional sports like triathlon and Formula One.Jan Frodeno, two times IRONMAN world champion, is using cosinuss° technology. cosinuss° One is our award winning sports wearable. Primary an in-ear heart rate monitor with a patent pending technology to measure very accurate inside the ear canal.Secondary it tracks body temperature, too. This technology is preventing overheating in sports. Used by IronMan world champion triathlete Jan Frodeno on Hawaii 2016.cosinuss° One showed us the effect of calf packing during fever for the very first time. For degree° we specialized on design and ergonomics for children especially during their sleep.The very first version of a prototype for a wearable body temperature device. This was made years ago along with Johannes PhD thesis about mobile vital sign monitoring.Further developing stages of our first wearable in-ear vital sign monitor followed over the years- and finally the cosinuss° One came to the market.The process of degree° design stages. First: flattening cosinuss° One. Second: change positioning of processing unit. Third: Minimizing edges and bulkiness. Optimizing ear anchorage.Finish geometry and making the degree° adjustable.

If you use a menstrual cup that fits your body well, it will provide incredible convenience in your daily life! Youtuber's Review! 


 
 Menstruation is a considerably large part of a woman's life from her teens to her fifties, occurring approximately once a month for an average of 3 to sometimes even 8 days. This is equivalent to roughly 3,500 days- almost 10 years of a woman’s lifetime!Women have used various products such as sanitary pads and tampons for a long time. However, there are many problems with these products, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We urgently looked for an alternative and finally stumbled upon a replacement product called a menstrual cup, but it was not easy to find cups to fit our unique bodies. So we thought, “why don’t we design a good product instead of looking for one?”We endeavor to deliver products that fit women perfectly, removing the discomfort that comes with other products. We hope that MORECUP will alleviate women’s menstrual discomfort worldwide by making our product adjustable to their individual bodies.It’s economical, eco-friendly, and fits perfectly.  It's very important that you can customize the product yourself. When you first use a menstrual cup, having a sensation of a foreign object or leakage is likely if you are using a product that does not fit your body accurately. This happens because each person has a different vaginal length (uterus height).  The vaginal length is the height from the entrance of the vagina to the cervix (the end of the uterus), from which menstrual blood is discharged. The principle of the menstrual cup is to collect blood by placing the cup under the cervix. Buying non-adjustable menstrual cup sizes which come in S, M, or L, is inconvenient and wasteful because you are potentially buying the wrong size. However, MORECUP provides a new concept for menstrual cups without this unnecessary process. MORECUP comes in one standard size that you are able to trim to fit your body using the cutter provided in the package.  To combat this, we made MORECUP with 100% medical-grade silicone which is completely harmless to humans. Since menstrual cups are inserted into your body, we created our product with a focus on safe material, so you can use MORECUP with confidence, free of worry.* FDA Registered Menstrual cups are largely divided into bell-types, which have an elongated shape, and sphere-types, which have a spherical shape. Bell-type cups have the advantage of an easier and more comfortable fit, while sphere-type cups have the advantage of collecting larger amounts of menstrual blood. MORECUP’s shape was designed to combine the advantages of both of these two types.

 Talking about your Patterns with family and friends might ignite deeper thoughts and conversations about Patterning your life.  Think how Patterning can help you find more peace, purpose and performance. Patterning a better life, together.As founders, we both have a proven track record for helping establish and grow zeitgeist brands & products, like suicide prevention charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably) & fashion workwear brand M.C.Overalls, to building new audiences for BBC Radio 1, American Idol & Spotify. And as we've already mentioned, at the heart of the practice is a unique sonic experience exclusive to Patterning, embodying 33 years of exploration of quantum science.  This takes some explaining - something we can do with curious fans in a longer conversation with us on Zoom.Patterning brings together our wide breadth of experience and progressive science into a practice that can empower us every day. 

We have an MVP in Beta  …but we know we can improve it with our product designers and developers. 


We have clear routes to market  …but we know we could use more muscle to market and manage those routes effectively.


We have a growing fan base of users  …but we know from experience 1000 fans are the tipping point to success.


We have a suite of documents ready to share ...so email us on hello@patterning.life if you want to know more.

 Purchase now to practice Patterning as a life-long beta user - for you, your young, your team or your organisation.With your help, we can ignite our fan base, refine the final product for scale, and market it effectively at launch this September.With your help, we can demonstrate how Patterning can galvanise the members of teams and whole organisations to align around shared values, purpose and productivity.As we have found exploring what Patterning means to our Gen X peers and groups of Millennials & Gen Z , our new practice chimes with many like-minds across generations.Join us... Patterning a better life, together.ThanksJames & Matt",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

It was built using ionic wind technology, which enables a non-consumable (reusable) filter, highly efficient filtration, and lower wind resistance/noise. It cleans the air in your home, so you can breathe clean and live a healthier life. It’s also a green solution to air purification, since it doesn’t use disposable filters and is energy efficient.</p><p><strong>What is ionic wind filtration?</strong></p><p>Ionic wind is wind generated by ions flowing under an electrical field. It’s an amazing technology that’s been recognized by Scientific American and the MIT technology review. Ionic wind filtration has two parts. First is the dust charging and collection stage.

It was built using ionic wind technology, which enables a non-consumable (reusable) filter, highly efficient filtration, and lower wind resistance/noise. It cleans the air in your home, so you can breathe clean and live a healthier life. It’s also a green solution to air purification, since it doesn’t use disposable filters and is energy efficient.What is ionic wind filtration?Ionic wind is wind generated by ions flowing under an electrical field. It’s an amazing technology that’s been recognized by Scientific American and the MIT technology review. Ionic wind filtration has two parts. First is the dust charging and collection stage. Air enters a chamber in the air purifier and gets charged. The charged ions/dust in the air then move under an electrical field, and there is an avalanching effect where more and more ions/dust are charged and moved under the field. Finally, they hit the electrically charged collecting plates, where the dust gets collected, and the ions are neutralized. The now clean air keeps its momentum and then exits the chamber. This process circulates and continues, which is how the Airdog X5’s ionic wind technology can clean the air in your house.How big of a room can the Airdog X5 purify?The Airdog X5 can be used in a 300 square foot room.How long does it take to purify the air in one room?Just 20 minutes. (It takes traditional air purifiers one hour.)How long does the reusable filter last?The collecting plates need to be washed every 1-2 months depending on the pollution level of the room. There's a built-in timer (600 hours) to conveniently remind you.

We developed our heating technology to mimic these effects so that all that built up tension deep within your body can just melt away.     The areas with the most amount of muscle tension were released by the infrared heating provided by Alpha Neck. This is done comfortably in a non-invasive manner.  Test institute: Professor Jae-Ho Yoo's team, Department of Physical Therapy, Sunmoon University Test subjects: 20 to 50 years old adult male and female / 20 subjects with neck pain 1) Those who complain of strong non-specific neck pain 2) Those who complain of chronic nonspecific neck pain 3) Those who complain of pain from non-traumatic neck pain Test period: 2021.01 - 2021.03       * The actual temperature can be differ from the temperature we have stated above. Turns off automatically after 10 minutes Once you place the Alpha Neck on the neck-bed side and lie down on it, the natural weight of your head will press your neck down onto the acupressure contact lines to provide deep yet gentle stimulation to the cervical spine.   This technique was inspired by the shiatsu massage style, which is well known for using acupressure to target, stretch, and massage the upper back muscles. The contact lines help the thoracic portion of the vertebrae find its correct position to take pressure off of the neck.    Check out how the body reacts to the acupressure contact lines around the neck and upper back area. Not only will you feel how loose your muscles get after a ten-minute session with Alpha Neck, but you’ll even see the difference!   This is as close you’ll get to the feeling of being massaged by a top-tier masseuse without ever leaving the comfort of your home! Whether it’s through the use of a smartphone, tablet, or computer, people in today’s world have developed habits that place a lot of burden on the neck. When positioned incorrectly, even gravity can have a negative effect.This is why practically everyone you know has experienced some or a lot of soreness and stiffness around the neck and upper back area.   In order to reverse the negative effects that gravity can have on a body with poor posture, Alpha Neck uses traction techniques to stretch out the cervical and thoracic vertebrae to release tension and untie knots.Bytargeting the upper back section along with the neck area, the root problem is taken care of properly so that you can experience full relaxation for considerably longer periods of time. 

Alpha Neck: Gives you a natural c-curve stretching without straining the cervical and thoracic vertebrae.

Foam Rollers: Places excess pressure on the spine which prevents it from gently holding the correct c-curve position.
  The cervical and thoracic vertebrae can be quite delicate which means you need specialized skills to properly carry out a traction massage on those areas. Developed jointly by a team consisting of physical therapists, licensed doctors, and pilates/yoga experts, Alpha Neck has been fine-tuned so that you are empowered to take care of your own body.  We have found that users that fall in the range of 5’0” - 6’6” and weigh no more than 300 lbs have experienced the most benefits from using the Alpha Neck.  Unlike those bulky turtle neck braces or kneading massagers you see online or in stores, Alpha Neck is drastically more compact and light which makes it convenient to store and take anywhere with you. We’ve also intentionally given it a clean form factor so that it doesn’t look out of place in any setting. 
Can be held with one hand and fits easily in a bag so that you can take it to your home, the office, the gym, your yoga studio, any vehicle, a plane, a train, and any other place you might want to take it to.
It can even be used when you’re sitting upright like a travel neck pillow.",58.0,0,"1 Campaign

</td></tr></tbody></table></div>","Introducing OYeet NEX massage gun, the world's strongest and portable percussion massage gun. With NEX, you can have all the benefits of a professional and high-speed high stoke massage gun. Get your massage therapy whenever and wherever you need it, all thanks to this pocket-size massage gun.
NEX comes in a stylish and elegant shape that’s small, practical, and has a noise level that’s between 45-55 dB (i.e. it’s pretty close to silent). Combined all together, you’re in a complete state of enjoyment, flow and relief when using NEX.  NEX is the perfect partner for any indoor or outdoor activities or sports: such as hiking, cycling, running, ball sports, you name it. You get rapid muscle recovery, maximum delivery and enhanced workout results.


OYeet has completed the NEX production stage and shipping is currently underway.  Thank you to our backers, we cherish the relationship that we have established with you. We hope that you are having a great user experience with your NEX Massage Gun. 
 




 



        
NEX goes 60% deeper into the skin at precisely 50 times per second and 3,500ppm. It targets sore spots, enhances muscle recovery, releases stress and tension within the body, and also soothes aches and pains.
 

Our founder and power users team searched for a natural solution for customer's pain. Ten versions later, we birthed NEX-a unique device that addressed our inital objectives. A massage gun that has a 40lbs force that doesn’t stall and, it offers greater tension release.
 

NEX’s streamlined, cutting-edge build means it’s only the size of an iPhone (6.1 x 3.9 x 1.8 in) and weighs just over a pound. Store it comfortably in your pocket and bag, that’s if the attractive design doesn’t have you showing it off to the world instead.

 When the slim, compact NEX is in your hand you’d never know you were holding a powerful engine. One that allows you to massage your entire body with just the one hand. It’ll turn you into a self-massaging master. Instead of using plastic shafts like other average massage device (which will probably last less than a year), OYeet NEX utilizes two, 100%-metal shafts with a heavy-duty 600 mN.m torque and a 30% longer life usage.  When you have a noise reduction design that’s patented and a motor that’s brushless, you get a powerful massage that’s practically silent. Whether at home or in public, quiet, 45 dB relief is with you.


With 240 minutes of battery life, you can spend 10 minutes every day on muscle recovery for an entire month, uninterrupted.


The Core-less Charging Stand beautifully displays your NEX for hassle-free charging and quick access to your device. Forgot to carry the charging stand? Don’t worry, simply plug the provided, universal USB cable into a wall charger or laptop and you're good to go.


NEX comes with 4 different speed settings controlled by a single button. Treat sensitive areas or use the full power of the device, with a simple click.  NEX is not only 60% smaller than most massage guns, it comes with a travel-friendly pouch. Go anywhere your active urges take you, and you’ll have immediate relief by your side.     NEX comes with four different shapes of massage attachments that are equally portable.  NEX comes with a guide on three sets of health solutions. Explore our step-by-step warm-up, recovery and ailment routines. You can also get a free, downloadable version from the official O’Yeet website.
     
We’re as confident as one can be about the quality of our product. However, if you’re still worried about something going wrong, the two-year warranty that comes with NEX gives you peace-of-mind.

</div></div>","HELLO! 
I'm Molly Burkett, a 27-year-old professional intuitive artist based in New York City. I use tarot cards, energy healing and do-it-yourself spirituality to help you unlock your inner strength and creativity. I've developed these services with care, passion, and determination, and I'm seeking to bring a new dimension to my practice: YOGA!


I'M REACHING OUT BECAUSE...
I was recently one of 24 students accepted into the dreamiest intensive, a 200-Hr Yoga Teacher Training in Bali, Indonesia, from September 5-30th, 2015. This program embraces the spiritual essence of yoga in addition to rigorous physical discipline. I will be practicing hatha and vinyasa flow, power yoga, yin/restorative, breath, mantra, as well as herbal medicine, Vedic astrology, and energetic anatomy, and more.
...It's going to be AM-A-A-ZING! 
Not only will I earn the credentials needed to teach yoga, but it will dramatically expand my abilities to offer exceptional services to my clients and community in Brooklyn, back home in Indiana, and beyond. Think psychic private yoga lessons, reiki+yoga workshops, and in-depth intuitive readings that acknowledge the whole of you: mind, body and being! 
This also marks a commitment to the next chapter in my personal path towards wellness: fully integrating everything I've learned on my inner journey and embodying it in the material world. I want to share everything I've learned, but in order to officially teach yoga, I have to earn the credentials!





THE HEALING POWERS OF YOGA

Meditation & yoga has been part of my remedy for clinical depression and PMDD over the past two years. (Read more of my story here and here.) I've learned how to transform my hypersensitivity into a superpower, and find balance in a natural and sustainable way. Since beginning a personal spiritual practice, I have:


given up smoking after 8+ years of addiction

weaned myself off of anti-depressants and therapy

no longer suffer from frequent panic attacks and migraines
quit my day job to start my own business
had countless psychic experiences with clients across the country

My practice has helped me to listen to the natural wisdom and intuition within, and helps me guide others to experiencing their own unique relationship with this inner voice. Yoga has helped me to respect the ever-changing nature of our bodies, and of life itself. 




THE NITTY-GRITTY 

My goal is to raise $3,000*, which is approximately half of my total expenses for three and a half weeks of spiritual study with master teachers. Adding roundtrip travel to Indonesia and various expenses since this will be my first time travelling internationally, *my actual costs will be around $5,000-$6,000. 
I have already submitted the $320 down payment to reserve my spot in the program. I must send an additional $1800 by August 5th, or my spot will be given away and my down payment will be forfeited! An additional installment of $1800 is due by September 5th for a total tuition & room/board cost of $3,920. The program offers no financial aid.
I'm a one-woman independent business, and I support myself entirely from tarot/reiki clients, classes, events, and workshops. Since I am unable to work the month of the training, and either way the costs would exceed my budget, I am humbly opening up to receive from my community!  




YOUR INVESTMENT IS REAL

Intuitives make the best teachers. They know when to motivate and when to comfort, when to be sassy and when to be sacred. With my down-to-earth speaking style and an unshakable dedication to keeping it REAL, you can trust that I will bring a strong new voice to the wellness community.

I am a dedicated supporter, collaborator, and teacher: This year I founded Sister Healing Exchange, a network for female entrepreneurs to trade services & develop their businesses. Through my educational platform Agency of Nu Age Magic, I've produced events for emerging readers and artists, as well as led workshops and moon circles. I'm currently mentoring a brilliant 12-year-old (!) pre-teen witch. Ultimately, your participation is a way to sustain a new wave of intuitive healing artists who are empowering their communities and changing the world.

And, of course, your POWER-PERKS! Ranging from tarot readings to reiki rituals to limited edition magical kits and intimate ceremonies, all the backer rewards are special and come straight from my heart to you. Some are even discounts on services, such as the $100 Deluxe Intuitive Session + Power Kit which is a $135 value. More prizes will be sprinkled in throughout the campaign. Watch this space!

<h3>Our Need:</h3>
<p class=""p1"">As we all know, if a doctor or a lawyer is involved, it's going to be expensive! Well, we at Camp Bethesda need both … doctors and lawyers. As we are starting our organization there are certain legal fees that must be paid, insurance that must be purchased, and medical staff that must be paid (during the camp). </p>
<p class=""p1"">For every child that will go to camp, it will cost us about $1,000. Our goal for our very first camp in the summer of 2014 is to send 50 kids to camp. As any mathematician, calculator or 3rd grade math will tell you, that's $50,000! So that's why we are here, asking for your help to get Camp Bethesda off the ground. We've laid the ground work and now just need your support. </p>
<p class=""p1"">So we are here to ask the community to help us raise the funds needed to pay legal fees, insurance  expenses and get us well on our way to sending kids to camp. As you can see, $10,000 is a fraction of what we will truly need to reach our goal of sending 50 kids to camp. <strong>So if you, our supporters, are generous and give beyond the $10,000 goal, know that for every additional $1,000 you are helping send one child with congenital heart disease to camp.</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Thank you for your generous support. We at Camp Bethesda are eternally grateful. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Sincerely,</p>
<p class=""p1"">Katie McLemore<br/>Executive Director<br/><br/></p>
<h3>About Us:</h3>
<p class=""p2"">Camp Bethesda is a camp for children between the ages of 8 and 18 that have congenital heart disease. We offer a safe place for kids to relax, be themselves, talk, cry, laugh, and heal.</p>
<p class=""p2"">We are a Christ-centered organization who believes that camp should be a physical, mental and spiritual experience.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Our summer camp is a 5 day 4 night camp that includes fun activities, chances to relax, socializing with other who have had similar experiences, times of praise and worship as well as biblical instruction time, and more.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Our hope is that a child who comes to Camp Bethesda will leave with a smile on their face, new friends in their life, and peace and healing in their heart.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Our Mission:</h3>
<p class=""p2"">Camp Bethesda is dedicated to meeting the emotional, psychosocial, psychological and spiritual needs for children by providing a Christian atmosphere and therapeutic activities.<br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Need:
As we all know, if a doctor or a lawyer is involved, it's going to be expensive! Well, we at Camp Bethesda need both … doctors and lawyers. As we are starting our organization there are certain legal fees that must be paid, insurance that must be purchased, and medical staff that must be paid (during the camp). 
For every child that will go to camp, it will cost us about $1,000. Our goal for our very first camp in the summer of 2014 is to send 50 kids to camp. As any mathematician, calculator or 3rd grade math will tell you, that's $50,000! So that's why we are here, asking for your help to get Camp Bethesda off the ground. We've laid the ground work and now just need your support. 
So we are here to ask the community to help us raise the funds needed to pay legal fees, insurance  expenses and get us well on our way to sending kids to camp. As you can see, $10,000 is a fraction of what we will truly need to reach our goal of sending 50 kids to camp. So if you, our supporters, are generous and give beyond the $10,000 goal, know that for every additional $1,000 you are helping send one child with congenital heart disease to camp.
Thank you for your generous support. We at Camp Bethesda are eternally grateful. 
Sincerely,
Katie McLemoreExecutive Director
About Us:
Camp Bethesda is a camp for children between the ages of 8 and 18 that have congenital heart disease. We offer a safe place for kids to relax, be themselves, talk, cry, laugh, and heal.
We are a Christ-centered organization who believes that camp should be a physical, mental and spiritual experience.
Our summer camp is a 5 day 4 night camp that includes fun activities, chances to relax, socializing with other who have had similar experiences, times of praise and worship as well as biblical instruction time, and more.
Our hope is that a child who comes to Camp Bethesda will leave with a smile on their face, new friends in their life, and peace and healing in their heart.
Our Mission:
Camp Bethesda is dedicated to meeting the emotional, psychosocial, psychological and spiritual needs for children by providing a Christian atmosphere and therapeutic activities.

Hello, My name is Roy L. Russ, and I am the President/CEO of Seniors Play a 501(c) (3) Non-Profit. Our mission is to increase physical activity among adults 50 and older. Our motto is: ""It's Easier To Play Than Exercise.""
Seniors Play has more than 50 persons participating in our Men and Women's Basketball, Softball, and Healthy Walking Programs. Our plan is to help reduce the high cost of health care by introducing Seniors to the Fountain of Youth, which is proper diet and exercise.
Seniors Play would like to increase our participants and expand our programming; however a lack of time and space prohibits us from doing so. With the influx of Baby Boomers attaining the age of 65, it is becoming apparent that Seniors are the fastest growing population in our communities.
Currently our programming is scattered throughout the City of Detroit, and we are in need of a facility to house all of our programming at one location. With your help we will start our first entrepreneurial venture, a Non-Emergency Transportation Company.
As President/CEO, I believe that we can begin to finance our mission and move toward our vision of self-sustainability. Your contributions will make it possible for us to purchase a bus to become a Non-Emergency Transportation Company to finance our mission.

There is nothing cosmetic or elective about trying to save your own life. I am forever in all of your debts. lily",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>      ==========================================</p>
<p>BioTETRAD is one type of a CyberMOD.  It consists of using several physical mod-cards (“moddies”) and appropriate software apps that each provide specific sensing and diagnostics for infectious disease pathogens and non-invasive testing and monitoring of medical conditions including selected biomarkers.  In future versions there will be therapeutic (e.g., medication release) moddies as well, but the basic BioTetrad CyberMOD does not provide (administer) therapeutics or pharmaceuticals.<br/><br/>BioTETRAD is a package of sensors and diagnostics.  It is not just a smartphone app or gizmo, but it works seamlessly with smartphones and tablets - by design, of course.</p>
<p>BioTETRAD mod-cards work with a wide variety of smartphone, tablet, and conventional computing devices, all  communications including voice and non-voice data transfer are accommodated through different wireless protocols that come either via attachments (e.g., smartphone or tablet) or a comms mod-card.  There are mod-cards for data defense against cyberattacks such as malware intrusion, and for long-performance power.<br/><br/>You do not need the whole ""package"" all at one time.  You use the components that matter - for biosensing and diagnostics for the disease of concern, and depending upon whether it is all about a person, or a pet, or one's food or water.  It is not only for emergencies and disasters.  It can be used by individuals, and also by healthcare providers and institutions.  Your funding will help it to be ""out in the field"" in 2013, and specifically in two areas of the world that really need this - some communities we are working with in Africa and also in the Fukushima area of Japan.</p>
<p>BioTETRAD is designed from the outset to adapt to new consumer and institutional products (e.g., next-gen smartphones and tablets), future sensing technologies (e.g., graphene-based), and future requirements for data protection and cyberdefense, the latter being an important dimension for all CyberMOD products given the acceleration in both internet dependencies and cyberattacks.</p>
<p>BioTETRAD’s architecture in both hardware and software adheres to the fundamental CyberMOD architecture and at the same time, it will adhere to the specific requirements of both the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize and Nokia Sensing X Challenge competitions, starting up right now this fall (2012) and in which we are set to register and compete and win.</p>
<p>Roots of the foundational R&amp;D including human-machine interfaces go back to the early 1990s and include work done at VCU/Medical College of Virginia, some at other universities (USA and Europe). Support and partnership has come from NSF, NIH, DARPA, USAID, Medicine for Humanity and partners such as Univ. of Toronto, Radford Univ., Virginia Tech, ST Microelectronics, Univ. of Costa Rica, Intel, Moscow State University and a few others, over the years.</p>
<p>Associated documents that are being made available in part or in whole include material from the X Prize Foundation competitions in which we intend to register and compete and complete - with BioTETRAD, although these are still in the early stages. </p>

<p>We have: credentials, commendations, references, and also, resources to provide and prove, demonstrable, 100% accurate and proper fiscal accounting and dinancial management.<br/><br/></p>
<p>YOUR FUNDING SUPPORT will be spent only on what is absolutely necessary, for purchase and project completion.  Every dollar given will be properly accounted for.  There may be a lot of people out there asking for money for all sorts of things, but here you can see that it is going to be put to proper good use.  You can rest assured on these points, and find the confirmation that I am speaking the honest truth.</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER that BioTETRAD includes a group of Mobile APPs which are for emergency/disaster aid, and for health/wellness growth, and these can be used independently.  So there is also this ""special new perk"" - everyone who contributes at least $20.00 will receive the EmergeSense App as soon as it passes through its beta testing.</strong></p>

BioTETRAD mod-cards work with a wide variety of smartphone, tablet, and conventional computing devices, all  communications including voice and non-voice data transfer are accommodated through different wireless protocols that come either via attachments (e.g., smartphone or tablet) or a comms mod-card.  There are mod-cards for data defense against cyberattacks such as malware intrusion, and for long-performance power.You do not need the whole ""package"" all at one time.  You use the components that matter - for biosensing and diagnostics for the disease of concern, and depending upon whether it is all about a person, or a pet, or one's food or water.  It is not only for emergencies and disasters.  It can be used by individuals, and also by healthcare providers and institutions.  Your funding will help it to be ""out in the field"" in 2013, and specifically in two areas of the world that really need this - some communities we are working with in Africa and also in the Fukushima area of Japan.
BioTETRAD is designed from the outset to adapt to new consumer and institutional products (e.g., next-gen smartphones and tablets), future sensing technologies (e.g., graphene-based), and future requirements for data protection and cyberdefense, the latter being an important dimension for all CyberMOD products given the acceleration in both internet dependencies and cyberattacks.
BioTETRAD’s architecture in both hardware and software adheres to the fundamental CyberMOD architecture and at the same time, it will adhere to the specific requirements of both the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize and Nokia Sensing X Challenge competitions, starting up right now this fall (2012) and in which we are set to register and compete and win.
Roots of the foundational R&D including human-machine interfaces go back to the early 1990s and include work done at VCU/Medical College of Virginia, some at other universities (USA and Europe). Support and partnership has come from NSF, NIH, DARPA, USAID, Medicine for Humanity and partners such as Univ. of Toronto, Radford Univ., Virginia Tech, ST Microelectronics, Univ. of Costa Rica, Intel, Moscow State University and a few others, over the years.
Associated documents that are being made available in part or in whole include material from the X Prize Foundation competitions in which we intend to register and compete and complete - with BioTETRAD, although these are still in the early stages.

Additional memos pertaining to CUBIT, BioScan, BioProt, NomadEyes research and product/service offerings, some of which are focused upon particular infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., influenza, salmonella, WMD pathogens) See http://biotetrad.tetradyn.com 

 My background including in the biomedical, epidemiological and public health areas, as well as on the electrical engr and information technology/computer science side, is at http://martin.instinnovstudy.org
We have: credentials, commendations, references, and also, resources to provide and prove, demonstrable, 100% accurate and proper fiscal accounting and dinancial management.
YOUR FUNDING SUPPORT will be spent only on what is absolutely necessary, for purchase and project completion.  Every dollar given will be properly accounted for.  There may be a lot of people out there asking for money for all sorts of things, but here you can see that it is going to be put to proper good use.  You can rest assured on these points, and find the confirmation that I am speaking the honest truth.
REMEMBER that BioTETRAD includes a group of Mobile APPs which are for emergency/disaster aid, and for health/wellness growth, and these can be used independently.  So there is also this ""special new perk"" - everyone who contributes at least $20.00 will receive the EmergeSense App as soon as it passes through its beta testing.

<p> </p>
<p>Shannon is 28 years old, living in Minneapolis Mn. Shannon attended Circle in the Square Theatre in NYC where she trained on Broadway. She received a B.A. Degree in Communication Arts from Marymount Manhattan College in NYC. She worked at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for several years as a manager. Shannon was currently working at Iqor up until her accident.  Shannon is currently involved with the Saint Paul Winter Carnival. Shannon is a caring, giving, and a outgoing individual. She has a passion for theatre, art, badminton, and photography. She is a huge animal lover and her dog Sammers is one of her best friends. Shannon's family and friends are extremely important to her.</p>
<p><strong>The Accident</strong></p>
<p>On January 20th 2012 Shannon was on her way to a doctor appointment when she was involved in a serious car accident. She was t-boned by a semi truck on the driver's side of her car. She was left trapped inside the car and the jaws of life were used to get her out.  Shannon was taken to Regions Hospital in St. Paul Mn. she suffered significant injuries, broken femur, several ribs, shattered pelvis, elbow, clavicle, back, bruised lungs, concussion, nerve damage in her arm, and memory loss.   Shannon had a surgery to repair her leg, they place a rod through her femur bone, a rod through her hip, and two screws in her knee.  She spent several weeks in the hospital recovering...while there she received extensive physical therapy where she learned how to walk again, put on her clothes, shoes, count, read, and write. etc... Recently, Shannon just had another surgery to repair nerve damage in her arm. Shannon still has another surgery ahead of her to remove all the hardware in her leg.  Once, she recovers from that surgery she will again need intensive physical therapy.  Shannon has had a long, difficult, and challenging journey to recovery.</p>
<p>  Due to Shannon's accident she had lost her job and health insurance...with Shannon being without health insurance for four month it made things extremely difficult.  Shannon has been left with a lot of medical bills and continues to need treatments to manage chronic pain and physical therapy to keep her strength up. We're trying to raise money to cover the cost of her medical bills, on going medical bills, future surgery, and living expenses.  </p>
<p><br/>  Throughout this entire process Shannon has kept a smile on her face and continues to have faith that there's a light at the end of the tunnel.  Shannon is so thankful for all the doctors and nurses that helped save her life, as well as, all of her family and friends that have been there for her...she thanks everyone for the well wishes, thoughts, and prayers! Shannon has always said, ""great things are truly possible as long as you believe.""  Shannon continues to defy odds and works hard every day. </p>
<p>  We are hoping to raise 8,000 dollars...any amount will truly help Shannon. If you are unable to give all we ask is you share this campaign with others. Thank you!</p></div>","About Shannon

It took her years and at least 100 doctors/hospital/specialist appointments and visits to finally receive a proper diagnosis. </p>
<p>In March 2014 Heather was 50% better in beating lyme, this has to do with her amazing lyme doctor &amp; her extraordinary chiropractor and naturopath team &amp; her own strength.  Heather was on same antibiotics for 18 months, she got bit by ‘something’ weeks ago, ever since then she went from being 50% better to only 10% better with 80% of her previous lyme symptoms returning.  She was bit by an unknown bug in late march which caused her ankle to turn red and swell double it’s size, insane itch, she wasn’t able to walk and I took her to the hospital emergency 3 times in one week to get no help, no referrals, nothing. For the last 6 months there was so much improvement, so much hope and light, and now, to be perfectly honesty, we are scared. Physically and neurologically it is as if Heather’s state is as it was before we even started lyme treatment back in September 2012.  I have to help her wash her hair, I have to prepare all of her meals, do her laundry and dishes as her joints are swollen, painful and inflamed and she can’t do the things she normally did for the last 6 months as this new ‘infection’ is making all symptoms return that were seemingly gone.  We have made an emergency appointment to go back to her lyme doctor only a month after seeing her, as everything we were doing (medication/supplement/etc wise) is no longer working.  So far, in 2014 Heather has gotten shingles 3 times &amp; is currently trying to recover from them again. Her immune system is compromised and this is the cause of them recurring.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/503632/files/20140412141040-perk1.jpg?1397337040"" src="""" style=""width: 588px; height: 422px;""/></p><p></p>
<p>Thank you to heather’s loving online family, on redbubble and face book, to her friends and even strangers that have donated in the past, shared this link, and supported her with love, kindness and patience and unconditional love during her journey. I couldn’t have helped heather go this far without all of you beautiful souls, and I don’t know what we would do without you. It’s a scary time, Heather likes to put on a brave face, but I myself am not only her best friend, but caregiver and have been watching her rapidly decline over the last few weeks. I need your help now more than ever.</p>
<p>If you know you were bitten by a tick and seek immediate treatment in Canada you go on antibiotics for a few weeks and you’re cured. If you didn’t know you were bit by a tick the tick not only infects you with a devastating bacteria, but it lays its eggs in your body which hatch in 18 days. Heather went almost 4 years in extreme physical pain, I watched her mind and body deteriorate in the most devastating way. Going to every medical appointment, ambulance ride, neurosurgeon, MRI, family dr visit and never getting an answer, having it all blamed on her ‘anxiety’ I decided to take matters into my own hands and researched full time, it was months of extensive research that all signs and symptoms pointed to lyme disease.  In Canada treatment beyond a month is NOT available. Chronic lyme is not treated in Canada, and the few doctors who have done so, have lost their license.  This is why we have to travel to the USA every 3 months for treatment and expensive antibiotics which are not covered.</p>
<p>The majority of people with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed for years and by the time it is discovered it is almost too late. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/503633/files/20140412141112-perk2.jpg?1397337072"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>In 2009 Heather had a gym membership, walked 5 miles a day, hiked, spent time in nature, and constantly doing photo shoots. Now, she can't walk more than 20 minutes, becomes so fatigued far too quickly, has difficulty breathing, chest pains, migraines, her joints swell up so bad she can't write or type, difficulty folding laundry, doing dishes and playing with her cat. Something in her body is malfunctioning as her entire body is covered in edema.</p>
<p>This woman means everything to me. I can't put into words how I love her. She is an amazing artist/photographer (<a href=""http://www.locustgirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><span>www.locustgirl.com</span></u></a><a href=""http://www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl</u></a>) and a genuine pure soul and there's nothing I won't do for her. Meeting someone like this only happens once in a lifetime, and I fear her lifetime will be over soon if her medical treatment is unable to continue.</p>

<p>Even while ill, both she and I helped out with other fundraisers (Rideau Valley Wildlife Sanctuary) by donating hundreds of dollars worth of her art to be sold to help treat injured wildlife. She went to college to learn how to take care of the disabled, now she is disabled.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/503635/files/20140412141139-perk3.jpg?1397337099"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>On a happier note, Heather got to spend time with her favorite wild snowy owl this year, snowy momma goddess and this owl was/is the reason why Heather continues to have hope/fight, as 3.5 yrs ago she had lyme and no one would help/diagnose her, and meeting this owl, watching this owl survive and brave the cold ALONE is what motivated Heather to change her life for the better, mentally and emotionally.</p>

But anyway, the doctors are hoping they caught it early enough to correct it with therapy. This therapy is going to cost me around $420. Now some people may say this isn't all that much but on my paycheck, after my bills, its next to impossible.

<h3>About the Tour</h3>
<p>Did you know that APEX Movement started the 1st parkour classes in the Western Hemisphere 7 yrs. ago? Since then, few organizations in the world have helped spread the benefits of parkour as much as APEX Movement. With 3 gym locations in CO, APEX Movement has taught thousands of people and entertained even more through performances, commercials, and online videos.</p>
<p>For the 2nd summer in a row, APEX Movement is touring 5000 miles across the USA and Canada to train, film, teach, and document the parkour lifestyle through high quality media. This year, the crew consists of Ryan Ford, Amos Rendao, Dylan Baker, Jake Smith, Cosmo Dudley, and Justin Clark.</p>
<p>Packing 6 people into a van for this tour takes a lot of hard work, time, and money. With your contributions, we will be able to fund our expenses such as food, transportation, and lodging. Additionally, we would love to be able to pay these amazing athletes and film makers a modest stipend for the instruction provided and epic media that will result from this tour.</p>

<h3>Why You Should Donate</h3>
<p>APEX Movement is a world leader in the development of safe parkour instruction. We have spent 7 years refining our curriculum and teachning methods for parkour. By traveling around and sharing these ideas with other parkour communities, we can all benefit through collaboration and encouraging safe, efficient training methods.</p>
<p>Additionally, we love to make parkour videos to share with the world for free online. Doing this takes a lot of work and time. We could sell the videos for a fee, but we would rather post them for free online so that people all around the world can access them easily and be inspired to further their own training.</p>
<h3>What We Will Use the Money For</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paying 6 athletes to perform, teach, and coordinate the 25 day tour.</li>
<li>Funding 6 athletes to eat for 25 days.</li>
<li>Tour van maintenance.</li>
<li>Gas expenses for 5000 miles of driving.</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous expenses including parking fees, train tickets, laundry, and more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to help us get the word out? You can help by sharing this fundraiser with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, parkour websites, and more.</li>

Additionally, we love to make parkour videos to share with the world for free online. Doing this takes a lot of work and time. We could sell the videos for a fee, but we would rather post them for free online so that people all around the world can access them easily and be inspired to further their own training.
What We Will Use the Money For

Paying 6 athletes to perform, teach, and coordinate the 25 day tour.
Funding 6 athletes to eat for 25 days.
Tour van maintenance.
Gas expenses for 5000 miles of driving.
Other miscellaneous expenses including parking fees, train tickets, laundry, and more.

<p>So far in little Lilly's life, she has been diagnosed with Optic Nerve Hypoplasia (she's legally blind) at 2 months, and suffered a stroke at 11 months old. These are 2 very rare, and unrelated instances. Being young, she is recovering from the stroke and with the help of adequate care, she will grow up strong and healthy :) </p>
<p>October 26th is a day I'll never forget.  I went in to get Lilly out of her crib and found her slumped against the rails, like she couldn't get her arms up to pull herself up.  I didn't think much of it and went about with her morning feeding.  We quickly noticed she would fall on her right arm when crawling and her fist was in a closed position.  This began an 11 day journey of tryins to diagnose why my baby wouldn't use her right arm/hand.  Once we diagnosed her stroke with an MRI, we began running multiple tests because we needed to know why she stroked...was it her heart, her blood, or her brain's vessels.  We ultimately found out that she has a narrowed blood vessel on the left side of her brain that spasmed, and caused a stroke.  This is now something we have to monitor to make sure the vessel doesn't continue to close, potentially causing more strokes.  The hope is the vessel will either stay the same, or possibly open back up.  Lilly is currently on asprin daily to keep her blood thin so it can pass through the narrowed vessel.  </p>
<p>Although she has insurance, the deductible is large and the hospital stays, multiple MRI's, angiograms of the brain and heart, etc are only covered 70%. We work very hard to stay on top of the growing list of monthly payments, but we've had to stop paying other things to do so.  We want to continue being able to provide for her and her brother, while maintaining access to the quality of care she needs :| Looking into next year, we will be monitoring the area of the brain that stroked, with an MRI, every 3 months. Thus far, her MRI's are costing around $3,500 out of pocket (we had an MRI back in March to diagnose her ONH with her eyes). Our out of pocket deducatble is $9,000...thus the $9,000 goal.  Any of this recovery fund will go straight into a new checking account we have already created to pay (current and upcoming) medical bills from. </p>
<p>Lilly is such an amazing gift. I joke that she is my ""ever serious baby"" :) She is so curious about the world around her, I am constantly wondering what she is seeing and thinking.  She has a very calm and curious demeanor, but can be very spunky and happy when she is surrounded by her family.  She is such a sweet baby and she continually amazes us.  When we found out about her eyes, one of our biggest worries was not setting the bar high enough for our visually impaired baby. Where is that happy medium of pushing her to learn, but not letting fail?  We can tell you that daily, she shows us she can do anything like a ""normal"" baby.  And now with her stroke, she is just learning to adapt without her right arm.  She just goes on and nothing seems to bother her.  We have learned so much from her in her short 11 months with us.  I hope those reading this either know her or get a chance to meet her one day.  She is a true gift from God, and we are blessed to be her parents. </p>
<p>Touching on the fact that her stroke took over 11 days to diagnose.  We went through 2 ER visits, an orthopedic doctor, a urget care doctor, and our pediatrician.  No one suspected that a baby so young could have suffered a stroke.  We asked anyone that would listen why they thought our baby wouldn't use her right arm, and kept it in a balled fist.  After more research, it shows that 11 out of 100,000 babies have strokes each year.  Needless to say, pediatric stroke awareness is nowhere near where it should be.  This is somthing our family is looking into immedately.  You can find a wealth of information about pediatric stroke on the CHASA website! You can even join and become a member and just ""tell somebody"" that KIDS HAVE STROKES TOO! :)</p>

A doula does not replace the support system; instead, they help support them so that they can focus on loving and encouraging the laboring woman. Doulas can serve as a source of information during pregnancy, labor and birth.

The ImpactThe Bellies, Birth & Babies Project is a fund raising effort which will provide the funds necessary to train 20 women as Community Doulas.  The project is geared towards low-income women and young mothers.  While the project will provide vital pregnancy and birth support to expectant and new mothers, it will also enhance the community by providing employment opportunities to women who often are underserved.A doula helps fill this gap by providing support to the woman and her partner or support system throughout the childbearing year. A doula does not replace the support system; instead, they help support them so that they can focus on loving and encouraging the laboring woman. Doulas can serve as a source of information during pregnancy, labor and birth.

<p>My name is Cassandra Yasko and I am both a dancer and the founder of Cloud Nine Supplements. Growing up I benefited from my mother’s holistic healthcare practice, and as such I have always been conscious of the benefits of natural supplementation.  However, through my experiences as a dancer I realized most of my friends and peers weren’t aware of the healthy alternatives they could use to support themselves and their practice. I want to raise awareness and education throughout the dance community about the benefits of proper supplementation.  It is this mission that inspired me to found Cloud Nine.</p>
<p>I am hoping to raise $8,000 to help formulate and expand my product line, as well create a user friendly e-commerce site that will primarily serve as a hub for information and resources on health and wellness for dancers at all levels. </p>
<p>Equipped with an understanding of health and wellness, alongside the powerful effects of proper supplementation, I believe dancers have their best chance for optimal performance and avoiding common injury and fatigue.</p>
<p>I worked very hard to put together a set of prizes for everyone who believes and supports my mission! From beautiful die cut stickers and the first Cloud Nine supplements, to custom Nalgene bottles and GAIA yoga mats, I've included prizes that will help support your active, healthy lifestyle! </p>
