Our Story 
Alternative Spring Break (ASB) is a week-long volunteering program of the Milton Community Youth Coalition for Milton High School students. The application process is competitive - about 35 students apply annually and 13 are selected to attend the trip. This year the group will travel to the New York City and New Jersey area to help with Super Storm Sandy relief efforts.
 
ASB is a focused project that builds leadership skills and new friendships. Past trips have included Biloxi, Mississippi to help with Katrina relief, Washington D.C. to work with the homeless, Macon, Georgia to help build housing for people in poverty, and Joplin, Missouri to rebuild homes destroyed by devastating tornadoes
.
The group of selected youth conduct various fundraising activities to cover expenses for the trip, with this campaign being one of them.
 
The Impact 
In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy roared up the East Coast of the United States. As a result: 

More than 100 people lost their lives
Gasoline rationing caused people to wait in line for fuel for generators and cars for up to 20 blocks
20,000 people in NYC alone need to be relocated to new homes
An economic loss of over $18 billion
 
Your contribution to the ASB program can make the experience real for these lucky MHS students.

When the hurricane struck, many buildings were destroyed, almost all of which still need to be rebuilt. Your contribution will assist families, youth, and a community in dire need of your help.
 
Many of the students have never been outside of Vermont. Along with helping those in need, you will provide the opportunity for these young people to explore another area of the country while helping others!
 
Every dollar helps! If the group does not reach its goal, we still keep the funds raised!
 
What We Need & What You Get 
The total cost of the program is approximately $12,000. All money earned goes to support travel and housing costs for the duration of the trip and building materials.

<p>Hi! My name is Christine and I am the owner/operator of Wild Rose Flower Farm. For the past seven years, I have faced considerable physical and economic challenge due to having an undiagnosed neuromuscular disease that rendered me disabled. All that changed almost two years ago when I was FINALLY diagnosed following a particularly nasty flare that landed me in the hospital for several weeks. Since beginning regular IVIg treatment, I have improved greatly and thus embarked on a long-time dream of owning a flower farm. This is my first year farming, and while my physical health has allowed me to do what was previously unthinkable, I've tapped out in what I can financially invest on my own. (Getting a farm up and rolling from scratch is no small task!) </p>
<p>Last winter, I began clearing land for what I envision to be a rose field and nursery, a piece of land used solely for growing, selling, and hybridizing roses suitable for cut flower production in Maine's cold climate. Fortunately, I was able to trade several cords of wood in exchange for the logger's time and labor. Unfortunately, I can't do the same for the excavation, drainage, and soil amendment needs, which will add up to no less than $2500. I'm therefore doing another unimaginable thing - asking for help. Currently, I'm doing everything I can think of to raise money on my own - hosting educational workshops, rose walks, etc, but I'm light years away from what I need to complete this project. I'm therefore setting up this campaign in hopes of being able to finish the field by Fall 2021 so it can be ready for spring planting. If you are unable to contribute, I just ask that you please share and spread the word about this dream for the future of Wild Rose Flower Farm. Alternatively, if you could help get word out about the regular weekly fundraising educational workshops, I'd be forever grateful! Many thanks to whoever is willing to help, and, if we ever meet...a dozen roses on the house! </p>

<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465240638/jpgs-45997_e375sx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The Yo-Yo industry is cosy small. Its a community. One of our goals as a company is to try to have a positive influence on that community. YoYo is so many different things to so many different people. Its an identity, a creative outlet, its a sport, a hobby, a passion.</p>
<p>We support competitive yo-yo as a way to continue the progression of yo-yo trick development and performance. In 2015 we formalized another way we wanted to promote yo-yo and that was as a vehicle for adventure. Usually our adventures are on the way to or from somewhere that we need to be for other reasons. Sometimes adventure is enough of an excuse itself.</p>
<p>We want to inspire our audience to get out there, see and be a part of the world. Leave a positive influence and share the stoke of traveling.</p> </div> <div> <h3>We have BIG dreams</h3> <p>We have already been to ICELAND, climbed Mt Fuji, Visited Everest Basecamp in Tibet to see the highest place on earth and gone to the lowest place at the Dead Sea.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465240756/6I2A1746_qjx1ue.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Ultimately we would love to visit every continent. Run YoYo Contests in distant lands for people who have never see a yoyo!</p>
<p>This one however is just the next step. We have visited Europe, Asia and North America. </p>
<p>Its time for SOUTH AMERICA and we are asking you to help.</p>
<p>In return we want to hook you up with some sweet product at a VERY friendly price AND invite you along.<br/></p>
<p>Our funding request is for $4000. </p>
<p>This generates enough profit to pay airfare accommodation and other travel expenses for 2 players for the proposed 7 day trip.</p>

We can share it with you and show you the breakdown of the expenses and how the $1500 gets spent.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHEN?</h3>
<div>September 2016 We plan to RETURN to LAX September 15 just in time for the USA National Contest starting September 16. So departing SEPT 8</div>
<div><h3><br/></h3></div>
<p></p>
<h3>WHY?</h3>We want to share the stoke. Inspire others to get out and see the world and get a better understanding of the world they live in. As part of the trip we meet other like minded travelers who we share yoyo with for them to pass along plus we will visit local communities and share yoyo with them too  </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Stuff happens. People get sick, weather doesn't co-oporate but thats life. One of our YoYoFactory Adventure trips was to summit Mt Fuji overnight. It was tough. While we survived, it was more survival than collecting video/photographs to share! Still we met a kendama master at the summit and now, you can find a YoYofactory YoYo and someone to teach you a trick at 13,000 ft every summer in Japan!</p>
<p>The other big surprise element is in ticket prices changing significantly. IF prices did change we would have to offer full refunds to anyone coming along prior to booking.</p>

<p>-Ben @ YoYoFactory</p>
</div></div>","We play yoyo. We played yo-yo before there was a YoYoFactory and we don't plan on stopping any time soon. Its what we do. We do it EVERYWHERE.


The Yo-Yo industry is cosy small. Its a community. One of our goals as a company is to try to have a positive influence on that community. YoYo is so many different things to so many different people. Its an identity, a creative outlet, its a sport, a hobby, a passion.
We support competitive yo-yo as a way to continue the progression of yo-yo trick development and performance. In 2015 we formalized another way we wanted to promote yo-yo and that was as a vehicle for adventure. Usually our adventures are on the way to or from somewhere that we need to be for other reasons. Sometimes adventure is enough of an excuse itself.
We want to inspire our audience to get out there, see and be a part of the world. Leave a positive influence and share the stoke of traveling.   We have BIG dreams We have already been to ICELAND, climbed Mt Fuji, Visited Everest Basecamp in Tibet to see the highest place on earth and gone to the lowest place at the Dead Sea.


Ultimately we would love to visit every continent. Run YoYo Contests in distant lands for people who have never see a yoyo!
This one however is just the next step. We have visited Europe, Asia and North America. 
Its time for SOUTH AMERICA and we are asking you to help.
In return we want to hook you up with some sweet product at a VERY friendly price AND invite you along.
Our funding request is for $4000. 
This generates enough profit to pay airfare accommodation and other travel expenses for 2 players for the proposed 7 day trip.



   The Destination? Ideally we would like to keep it a secret until the June 24 reveal, but if you are serious on coming, contact us! We can share it with you and show you the breakdown of the expenses and how the $1500 gets spent.

WHEN?
September 2016 We plan to RETURN to LAX September 15 just in time for the USA National Contest starting September 16. So departing SEPT 8


WHY?We want to share the stoke. Inspire others to get out and see the world and get a better understanding of the world they live in. As part of the trip we meet other like minded travelers who we share yoyo with for them to pass along plus we will visit local communities and share yoyo with them too    Risks & Challenges Stuff happens. People get sick, weather doesn't co-oporate but thats life. One of our YoYoFactory Adventure trips was to summit Mt Fuji overnight. It was tough. While we survived, it was more survival than collecting video/photographs to share! Still we met a kendama master at the summit and now, you can find a YoYofactory YoYo and someone to teach you a trick at 13,000 ft every summer in Japan!
The other big surprise element is in ticket prices changing significantly. IF prices did change we would have to offer full refunds to anyone coming along prior to booking.


Whats that other perk?

Oh yeah, you noticed?  The Titanium Shutter!



in 2015 we launched our first Indiegogo campaign for the DREAM Titanium YoYo. We had a a lot of fun, created some amazing YoYos and really enjoyed the process. It's the main reason we are back here!  Knowing people love titanium YoYos we decided this would be the perfect platform to introduce our newest Ti YoYo, to offer our original supporters another great deal.

This item will be produced ONE time. It will be available here, and only 6 stores. After that it will be retired to history.

Performance wise. Its a beast. Sound and sight wise, its a beauty. Spark wise.... well we haven't done that yet....


The Stretch:
AT
$4,000 we go!
2  PROS head SOUTH!
AT

$10,000 A 3rd member of YYF team will get added to the trip.
The super stretch is now $50,000. Its a long shot, But we will throw it out there that if we hit $50k the Adventure after this will be ANTARCTIC Adventure. Seriously. How cool would that be. Ok, we don't expect to hit it but its all about dreaming :)

Smaller than your sleeping bag and lighter than a 1-person tent, the Mantis offers a lightweight respite for hikers on trail.  Available in BackerKit after the campaign,  these accessories help maximize your camp. Each accessory seamlessly integrates with the Mantis and compresses in the Mantis stuff sack for optimal packability.Organizer (Indiegogo pricing - $19): The Mantis Organizer is a suspended pouch for mobile, small storage inside the Mantis. The Organizer attaches with knotless hooks to the ridge line inside your canopy and moves along the line for easy access. It’s the perfect lightweight storage option for your phone, granola bar and headlamp. Gear Loft (Indiegogo pricing - $19): The Gear Loft is a removable, lofted sling to keep your essentials elevated and close at hand inside the Mantis. Suspended from the ridge line in the peaks of your canopy, the Gear Loft is perfect storage for your book, beanie, and a back-up pair of socks inside the Mantis. Storing your gear is easy - no knots necessary to hang your Gear Loft.Winter Barrier (Indiegogo pricing - $69): An accessory for colder months, the Winter Barrier takes your Mantis to winter temps by zipping seamlessly into your canopy. To create a cozy cocoon inside, the Winter Barrier blocks out the cold and features steam vents to eliminate condensation. All accessories will be available in limited quantities after the campaign.  Set-up fast, sleep comfortably and minimize your footprint by opting to hammock camp. Curving to the natural arch of your back, a hammock provides soft support off the ground. No stiff necks or sore backs in the morning. Set up for hammock camping is quick: simply wrap your python straps around two trees 13’ to 18’ apart, and clip in. Hammock camping also leaves a minimal impact on the environment. According to Leave No Trace, “hammocks generally leave a very small footprint and are good examples of minimum impact shelters.” Learn more here.   Sleep off the ground in a silky soft hammock enclosed in our Stargazer™ mesh canopy. The Mantis all-in-one hammock tent features built-in pockets and a structural ridge line to keep what you need close at hand. Cozy up, campers.  An all-in-one hammock tent to protect you from the elements, no matter what Mother Nature throws your way. The Mantis’ customizable features - insect net, rainfly, and winter barrier - provide shelter and allow you to shed weight when you need to. Lighter than your tent and easier to set up, the Mantis takes camp set-up to 60 seconds with a knotless suspension. No more knots, no more tent poles. It’s time to put your feet up faster. Early morning starts just became easier, too, with a quick tear-down.     The Mantis Ultralight™ harnesses new fabrics and fibers innovated to lighten your pack. The Levitas™ 20D nylon ripstop is the strongest, lightest hammock fabric in its class. The included Python 10 Ultralight straps are constructed with SpiraLine™, a high-molecular polyethylene fiber that weight for weight is 15 times stronger than steel. These innovations make the Mantis Ultralight the lightest all-in-one hammock tent with the highest strength to weight ratio. See what the pros have to say about the Mantis Ultralight...Derek Hansen, expert hammock camper and creator of The Ultimate Hang, got a sneak peek of the Mantis Ultralight and Python 10 Ultralight straps and ""was delighted to see the attention to detail at every key feature.""

brand and we've been in the business of designing and manufacturing travel apparel since 2015. Our team has extensive experience in fabric design and manufacturing high-quality apparel as well as fulfilling hundreds of thousands of orders. This is the 2.0 version of our shoes and the feedback from the previous campaign has been taken into consideration to help improve our designs and sizing. We have our manufacturers lined up, and our production team is waiting for our signal.</p><p>We've had our fair share of manufacturing hiccups in one of our earlier campaigns and we've dealt with them in a transparent, responsible way by keeping our backers updated and we’ve always delivered all of our commitments towards our backers. Should any issues come up, you can be confident we will handle them with transparency and utmost care for you.</p><p>Supply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain and are confident that we can fulfill all the orders. But sometimes things happen, such as fabric delays due to the yarn being stuck in customs, etc. We've added buffer time for such events, but sometimes it's not enough. If anything should arrive late we will get through it together.</p><p>The BAUBAX brand is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Jamiak, Inc., and is run under the leadership of our President Mr. Jason Akatiff. The new leadership team has extensive experience in international supply chain and we are more confident than ever on our promise of delivering all the rewards to our backers.</p><p>Thank you for your support!

We have our manufacturers lined up, and our production team is waiting for our signal.We've had our fair share of manufacturing hiccups in one of our earlier campaigns and we've dealt with them in a transparent, responsible way by keeping our backers updated and we’ve always delivered all of our commitments towards our backers. Should any issues come up, you can be confident we will handle them with transparency and utmost care for you.Supply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain and are confident that we can fulfill all the orders.

Make up to 70% more space 
Provides powerful compression while weighing only 172g (6oz) and making less noise
Eliminates bad odor and bacteria in the luggage or in the closet
Packs away old clothing, duvets, seasonal items and more
   2. Store clothes for longerAIRDOT vacuum storage bags are thinner and stronger than the competition by AIRDOT’s special technologies. Pack once and keep the space you need for your entire trip. Also, compress and store blankets, winter clothes, or thicker items to save space in your closet. We designed the AIRDOT Vacuum Storage Bag to keep sealing for more than 6 months with its embossed surface and superior material with excellent tensile and puncture resistance. We are continuing to measure how long the AIRDOT bag can hold the seal. See more details below in the section [AIRDOT Vacuum Storage Bags].   3. 3-ways to use the AIRDOT vacuum bagsYou can use the AIRDOT in any situation!AIRDOT vacuum bags are versatile and can be sealed using three methods:
AIRDOT vacuum pump
Vacuum cleaner
By hand
   ※ Better Quality Assurance for all.We promise to keep you informed during all stages of this campaign so you can know exactly what's happening in our production process. See more details below in the section [AIRDOT Development].  ​We will provide the AIRDOT connector for free to all backers.As feedback from many backers, we decided to make the AIRDOT connector. We are doing our best to make the AIRDOT connector to be compatible with other vacuum bags in the market and we are considering many options and possibilities about the design, materials, molds, etc. with the production factory in detail. Please enjoy the hints of the AIRDOT connector in the AIRDOT Making Film #4 of the section [AIRDOT Development].   ▶ PROBLEM: Packing and organizing clothes are tough We're travelers just like you. And we hate fighting with our luggage and trying to get everything to fit into one bag.Also, we need to organize everything in our closet just like you. And in the warm spring, we are especially concerned about how to organize our winter clothing in a wardrobe. ▶ SOLUTION: Airdot Vacuum Pump & Storage BagWith AIRDOT you can pack your bags faster, save space, have more room to bring home souvenirs, and travel stress-free. And you can organize your wardrobe's clothing.AIRDOT is a vacuum system that combines the AIRDOT vacuum pump with AIRDOT vacuum storage bags.This system can be used before your trip, during your trip, at home, or anywhere you need to create more storage space.    1. AIRDOT IS LIGHTWEIGHT & COMPACTThe AIRDOT vacuum pump weighs less than a smartphone and can fit inside tote bags, purses, and other carry-on bags. 2. AIRDOT HAS MULTIPLE POWER OPTIONSThe AIRDOT vacuum pump works with any power source and can be powered by Portable Battery, Wall Charger, USB port. 3. AIRDOT IS TRAVEL READYThe AIRDOT vacuum pump and storage bags can be taken on the plane in your carry-on bag or placed in your checked luggage.  4. AIRDOT IS QUIETAt just 50dB, the AIRDOT vacuum pump is up to 20% quieter than other portable vacuum pumps and the person sitting next to you on the plane who won’t stop talking. 5. AIRDOT HAS MOTOR COOLING SYSTEMThe AIRDOT vacuum pump uses incoming air to cool the motor. This protects the motor from overload and extends its life.   1. A BETTER VALVE FOR A BETTER VACUUM BAGThe valve on AIRDOT storage bags doesn’t have a cover, and they are thinner than any other vacuum storage bag.A “no-cover” design means that you’ll have one less thing to worry about when you’re traveling because there’s nothing to lose when you’re using the storage bags. Thinner valves also make it easier to pack extra vacuum storage bags in your suitcase.  2. AIRDOT STORES CLOTHES FOR LONGERWith its embossed surface and superior material with excellent tensile and puncture resistance, AIRDOT vacuum storage bags can hold their seal for up to 6 months! Pack once, and keep the space you need for your entire trip. AIRDOT vacuum storage bags can also be used to save space in your closet. Compress and store blankets, towels, or other items.  In our advertisement, we described the duration of the sealing of the AIRDOT Compression bag as 30 days, the minimum period. However, we designed the AIRDOT compression bag to keep sealing for more than 6 months. We are currently testing beyond 105 days until the AIRDOT vacuum bag loses its sealing. Explore our test videos: TEST #1 and TEST#2.  3. A BETTER VACUUM STORAGE BAG FOR CLOTHING AIRDOT’s special embossed surface allows clothing to be compressed 4 to 5 times more than traditional vacuum bags will let you. The embossed surface creates air channels that pull air out of the bag more efficiently when using the AIRDOT vacuum, a household vacuum, or hand rolling.AIRDOT storage bags are equipped with sealing channels that have double mating pairs. These sealing channels are arranged in a unique configuration that creates an airtight seal during compression and reduces leakage over time allowing you to save space for longer periods of time.On the bottom of every AIRDOT vacuum storage bag is a patented adhesive film that helps the bag maintain its vacuum seal for longer without compromising the storage capacity of the bag.   3-WAYS TO USE THE AIRDOTAIRDOT vacuum storage bags can be sealed using the AIRDOT vacuum pump, a standard vacuum cleaner, or by hand. Connect the AIRDOT vacuum pump to the AIRDOT vacuum storage bag by inserting the AIRDOT vacuum pump into the valve on the bag. Tilt slightly to get a firm connection, and then press the button on top of the AIRDOT vacuum pump.    The blue LED light of the AIRDOT vacuum pump indicates the operating status.  The AIRDOT vacuum pump is a smart device and can automatically turn itself off when the vacuum process is completed. Also, the AIRDOT vacuum storage bags are smart, and can automatically lock the valve after the AIRDOT vacuum pump is removed.  Check out the demonstration video below.  AIRDOT vacuum storage bags are compatible with most household vacuum cleaners that have a circular entrance that’s 27mm / 1.06in diameter or greater. For reference, the most common size of a household vacuum cleaner hose is 32mm / 1.26in.  If you don’t have a household vacuum cleaner handy, or a power source for the AIRDOT vacuum pump, you can remove the air out of the AIRDOT vacuum storage bags by rolling them up with your hands.Seal the bag first, place the bag on a hard surface, and begin rolling the bag starting at the end you just sealed.     :: THE AIRDOT CLIPMakes it easy to fully close the AIRDOT vacuum storage bags with a single slide. And you can also use it with other vacuum bags!  :: AIRDOT IS DESIGNED FOR VACATIONS, INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL, AND EVERYDAY USE :: NON-ROLLING DESIGN WITH EASY TO GRIP CIRCULAR-SHAPE MAIN BODY :: CAP AND O-RING ON THE AIR INTAKEOn the bottom of the AIRDOT vacuum pump are a cap and o-ring. The cap prevents dust from entering the air intake and damaging the motor. The o-ring prevents air leakage during compression and makes it easier to connect the AIRDOT vacuum pump to the AIRDOT vacuum storage bags. :: AIRDOT HAS DESIGN FOR HUMAN FACTORS :: AIRDOT IS BUILT TO LAST   :: AIRDOT IS ECO-FRIENDLYThe AIRDOT was designed to be bought once and used 1000 times. We wanted to create a device that was eco-friendly. And required customers to reuse it again and again instead of buying new items and generating more waste. When you receive your AIRDOT, it’ll be packaged in recyclable materials that are eco-friendly. AIRDOT vacuum storage bags are also recyclable as well.   AIRDOT Vacuum Pump AIRDOT Vacuum Storage Bags   All pledges placed in Indiegogo Project will start shipping in September 2020.       We started AIRDOT with one simple motto: “If you do your best, step-by-step, even with the small stuff, you can change everything”.We’re trying to show that two individuals can change the small things with a little bit of engineering know-how to create products that have tremendous value.Thank you for joining us on our journey in creating our first product the AIRDOT.     AIRDOT MAKING FILM #1The production of AIRDOT is largely composed of compressors and compression bags.

Through this process, we were able to develop vacuum seal bags for clothing that are easier to seal, hold their seal longer than leading brands, and a vacuum pump that’s more efficient and quieter. We now have a fully developed and working prototype that’s ready for manufacturing. We’ve also begun the injection molding process to help speed up the delivery of the AIRDOT after the campaign has ended. Many projects fail to meet their delivery deadlines because of failures during the injection molding process. To reduce our risk of failure, we’re currently working with an experienced injection molding company with all the necessary equipment to bring the AIRDOT to life.",63.0,6,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","The translation software is free and it comes part of the purchase of the Fito earphone. It is free only for our Indiegogo backers during this limited campaign time.
 

Fito Tap Pro is a portable, instant voice translation earphone for travelers, students, business professionals, employers and medical staff to read, write and speak in different languages, anywhere in the world. 
 

 
 
 

More than 30+ languages can be automatically detected and translated through an app.

 

 
Translator supports the following languages: 
Egyptian Arabic • Saudi Arabian Arabic • Catalan • Croatian • Czech Tranditional Chinese • Mandarin Chinese • Simplified Cantonese • Danish Dutch American English • Austrailian English • British English • Indian English • Finnish French • Canadian French • German • Greek • Hebrew • Hindi • Hungarian • Italian Japanese • Korean • Malay • Norwegian • Polish • Portuguese • Romanian • Russian Brazilian Portuguese • Slovak • Spain Spanish • Latin American Spanish • Swedish Thai • Turkish • Vietnamese
 
 

Fito Tap Pro earphones come with a smartphone app. We use Microsoft Translator API to handle translation between two different languages in a real-time. The software lets you select a “Home Language” and a “Foreign Language” before begin a conversation. 
There are 3 ways to use the translation app:
Option 1 - Converse Mode: Press the “Power Button” (O) on the charging case (for 3 seconds) and start speaking. Make sure your earpieces are placed inside the case to activate. Press the right triangle arrow (▷) to  translate your own language to a different language and press the left triangle arrow (◃) to translate foreign language to your native language.
Option 2 - Private Mode: Put your earphones in your ear and start speaking. Tap on the “Language Button” on the bottom to translate into another language.
Option 3 - Learning Mode: You may type directly into the app.
 

 

*Microsoft Translator API is powered by cutting-edge technology used by Office, Bing, Skype, Internet Explorer as well as by partners such as Twitter, Yelp, eBay, WeChat and more.The app is available for both iOS and Android devices.
 

Microsoft translator is based on neural machine translation (NMT) system. NMT provided major advances in translation quality over the then industry-standard statistical machine translation (SMT) technology. Because NMT better captures the context of full sentences before translating them, it provides higher quality, more human-sounding and more fluent translations. Learn more.

 
 
 

The two microphones + cVc(clear Voice capture by Qualcomm) noise cancelling technology picks your voice accurately from a noisy background. It reduces ambient noise in your conversation and presents your clear voice to the person on the other end. 

Learn more about cVc noise cancelling technology
 
 
 

When used in unison with the translation service, the four microphones (from both earphones) in the charging case form a matrix to pick up sound with optimal accuracy and sensitivity to effectively improve the conversation smoothness. 

 
 

 
 
 
 

Fito Tap Pro does way more than simply translate. Enjoy the world around you with Fito Tap Pro. 

 
 
 

 
Tap Pro is equipped with a Qualcomm QCC3026 chipset. As the most advanced Bluetooth chipset series in the industry, QCC chipsets are featured with Bluetooth 5.0 Low Energy, and advanced technology specifically designed for true-wireless.

Learn more about QCC3026 Chipset
 
 

Most Bluetooth 4.0 chipsets in the market have their power consumption at around or above 20mA (milliamp). Some Bluetooth 5.0 chipsets can control the power consumption at or slightly above 10mA. QCC series’ sub-6mA consumption is about half of the competitors and definitely unbeatable in today’s Bluetooth market. *A mA is a unit of measurement for an electric current flowing through an electrical conductor and a measure of the rate of flow of electrons.

 
 
 

FITO Tap Pro is equipped with the most advanced consumer level accelerometers. It offers its users an even better experience with an optimized shape of the earphone body. Simply double-tap on the earphone to play/pause music or answer/end phone calls.

 
 
 

The proximity sensor and optical sensors are combined to allow the earphone to detect if it is in or out of your ear accurately.

 

The dynamic driver in FITO Tap Pro is applied with a graphene coating, which ensures the precision of oscillation, thus enhances sound clarity over its frequency spectrum, especially for the mid and treble range. *The structure of graphene – a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice.  The charging case recharges your earphones in a fast and safe way. FITO Tap Pro extends its overall lifespan much longer than the 5+ hours of pure music playback. Compared to other Bluetooth 5.0 earphones with the same battery capacity, you’ll find yourself having to charge FITO Tap Pro less frequently.
A 10 minute charge can support the earphone to provide 1 hour of music playback
A full charge on both earphones with the case provides 24 hours of music playback
    Fito Tap Pro is IP65 rated. It is water resistant and will not be damaged by sweat or rain. Water projected by a nozzle (6.3 mm) against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects. It is also dust tight, which means no dust gets inside the earphone to cause damage.  An elegant design with a premium housing allowing for maximum portability and protection.      

 
 
 
 
 



 
 
 
 




 
 
 

Compared to the available basic version (T1). Tap Pro is a big leap offering an upgrade on all basic core features and we need your support to accomplish this great improvement.

<p>Our history began a long time ago. We have successfully operated in textile business for over <strong>25 years</strong>, and still today we create every single shirt with the same love and care of the first one. The company was founded in the middle of the twentieth century in Rome, playing an important role in the history of the famous Italian tradition of high-quality clothing. Italy’s old tradition of world-class craftsmanship, rich culture and history of fashion are our daily inspiration for every new design project.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>Building on 25 years of experience in the textile and fashion industry, our launch of Zeno Shirt on Kickstarter is so we can present to the world this innovative product that breaks all the rules when it comes to shirts and fashion. We know our mission is challenging, and although we have carefully planned and prepared for launch, there inevitably may be some unexpected events ahead. We have anticipated potential risks and have developed contingency plans as well. <br/>Beginning with a solid business foundation and many years of industry experience, you can be confident in our ability to execute. In preparation for launching Zeno Shirt on Kickstarter, we have produced and tested dozens of samples. We have very close working relationships with the production lines in Turkey, and are continuously improving our processes and products. <br/>We have faith in the product we are introducing, confidence in our Kickstarter plan, and a history of reliable and on-time business operations. Our promise is to do what we have said and we will keep you informed on all progress and any unexpected events, both during the campaign and afterwards. <br/>Care instructions for Zeno Shirt: Most surface stains can be simply removed by gently cleaning with cold water on a damp cloth. If soil is rubbed into the fabric fibers, machine wash in cold water only. Following these instructions will provide long life of the exclusive Zeno treatment on your shirt.</p></div></div>","Zeno Shirt is 100% made from natural, breathable cotton fibers. Thanks to exclusive Zeno technology, Zeno Shirt is Anti-Stain, Anti-Sweat, and Non-Iron. At the end of the day, you will feel as impeccable as you did in the morning.

2 Ply Premium Cotton: Zeno Shirt is crafted in a high premium two-ply cotton that provides a smoother touch and is 10 times more durable than normal cotton typically used in the industry.

 
 

 

 

 
REGULAR FIT
Classic and versatile, the Zeno Regular Fit Shirt projects dignity and refinement.

 
SLIM FIT
Modeled on your body, the elegant Zeno Slim Fit Shirt will always be comfortable.

About us

Our history began a long time ago. We have successfully operated in textile business for over 25 years, and still today we create every single shirt with the same love and care of the first one. The company was founded in the middle of the twentieth century in Rome, playing an important role in the history of the famous Italian tradition of high-quality clothing. Italy’s old tradition of world-class craftsmanship, rich culture and history of fashion are our daily inspiration for every new design project.
 
Risks & Challenges
Building on 25 years of experience in the textile and fashion industry, our launch of Zeno Shirt on Kickstarter is so we can present to the world this innovative product that breaks all the rules when it comes to shirts and fashion. We know our mission is challenging, and although we have carefully planned and prepared for launch, there inevitably may be some unexpected events ahead. We have anticipated potential risks and have developed contingency plans as well. Beginning with a solid business foundation and many years of industry experience, you can be confident in our ability to execute. In preparation for launching Zeno Shirt on Kickstarter, we have produced and tested dozens of samples. We have very close working relationships with the production lines in Turkey, and are continuously improving our processes and products. We have faith in the product we are introducing, confidence in our Kickstarter plan, and a history of reliable and on-time business operations. Our promise is to do what we have said and we will keep you informed on all progress and any unexpected events, both during the campaign and afterwards. Care instructions for Zeno Shirt: Most surface stains can be simply removed by gently cleaning with cold water on a damp cloth. If soil is rubbed into the fabric fibers, machine wash in cold water only. Following these instructions will provide long life of the exclusive Zeno treatment on your shirt.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

Quiver X enables you to move seamlessly from place to place, from indoor to out, from work to play in just one pack. Carrying just a single bag for your life's activities has been our promise since our first Kickstarter campaign. We are committed to meeting that every single time. Always have, always will.
Everything-Resistant

Packed with interior and exterior organisational pockets, dedicated compartments for both a laptop and tablet, plus a quick access card slot pocket with RFID protection, Quiver X is constructed to meet your everyday adventures.
 
Hear what others have to say: 


Whether you’re pitching in the field or the boardroom, we've got your back. Leave your dirty kicks in the large compartment and pull your laptop from the all-new laptop compartment, padded for extra protection.
Padded laptop and tablet compartment

Traveling is now an everyday affair. But with great traveling comes the need for great security. In New York City alone, the NYPD reported 3000 pickpocket incidents a month,with most cases going unreported. Each day, more than 400,000 pick pocketing incidentshappen around the world. 
The problem with existing anti-theft bags...
Imagine having to dial the same 3 digit code every time you open your bag for your laptop. And then again for your charging cables. And then again for your notebook if you forget it.


1. Time-wasting2. Inaccessible to essentials3. Frustrating for everyday usage



In fact, as high as 50% of users reported not even using the locking functions of their bags for everyday usage. At BOW, we wanted to solve that. After thousands of emails, brainstorming and a whole lot of designing, we're proud to introduce Quiver X’s Auto-lock zip mechanism. 
Want to lock your bags and secure your valuables? Just touch the zips together (yes, it's that magical!) 
Autolock Zip Mechanism
 Want to unlock it? Just pull it to the side and voila. 
Quiver X VS Other Anti-theft Bags 

Suitable for travellers and daily commuters alike, the privacy pouch acts like a safe for your most valuable items ( passport, money, wedding ring…) against pickpockets and other potential threats.

Showering after a hard run or a night in the office? Quiver X’s 180 shower compartment comes with dedicated pockets for your toiletries and clothes. Hook Quiver X on the shower door and grab what you need at a glance.

Navigate your phone anytime, anywhere. Integrating a waterproof touch-sensitive fabric, Quiver X enables you to navigate your phone through the pocket – in the shower, or when your hands are grimy from the rock wall.

I just wanted to start off by giving a big thank you for stopping by my Indiegogo page! I know that it is easy to get caught up in our lives, and I know that there are probably some of you that I have not spoken to in a while (we have to fix this error). I think it goes without saying that we often need to slow things down in order to appreciate our surroundings and each other, this is precisely why I am doing a bike tour from Denver Colorado to Phoenix Arizona. I also want to reiterate that if you are unable to, or choose not to back my trip that it is totally fine to check out what I am doing, and what adventures lie ahead. I hope too that my trip might inspire others to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. For the next few minutes I would like to do a quick overview of how I got into this adventure, and a brief outline of what I am doing, and where I am going. After that we will sum up what your donations will do for me, and lastly, what your donations will get you (I know that what I will be giving back is a bit meager, but I still hope that you enjoy it).</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>What the heck am I doing, and how did I get into this mess?</u></strong> Both good questions! I am going to be riding my bicycle from the small town of Castle Rock near Denver to Phoenix Arizona. Most of my ride will be cutting through the southern part of the Rocky Mountains where I will then cycle through the Northwest portion of the Navajo Nation in New Mexico. I decided on Phoenix for a couple of reasons, the main one being that my brother Devan just moved out there last year and I want to go see him and Shannon and my nieces. I have also not explored this region of the United States very much and what better way to see it than on the saddle of a bicycle!!</p><p>    But how did I decide to do this? Well last May I sold my vehicle and decided that I would commute to work full time and use my bicycle as my primary means of transportation. I ended the year with over 1200 miles commuted to work, not to mention cycling that I did on my free days. Needless to say I immediately fell in love with cycling and decided to try bike packing. Bikepacking is essentially backpacking but cycling instead of hiking (for the most part).

Though I do have some vacation time saved up, I do not have nearly enough to cover the entire trip (I will be taking off a month from work). The amount I am asking for in addition to the vacation time that I have accrued should allow me to do my trip and give me a slight cushion in case anything bad happens along the way. If I do end up getting more money than what I am asking then those funds will go towards my next bike touring adventure, so if you would like to make a donation but I have already hit my goal, don’t think that it won’t go towards the same cause. Throughout the last year and a half I have obtained most of the gear I will need on my trip, but what I still need are mostly essential items. Though I would sincerely appreciate gifts of these items, due to the nature of my job I can get good discounts on all said gear. The list is as follows:</p><p>Ortlieb sport-packer plus (Main set of front panniers, I have already purchased the rear panniers)</p><p>Revelate Designs Tangle bike frame bag (Bag for putting bike tools, snacks, and extra storage space)</p><p>Garmin Explorer 820 (I have not 100% decided on this, and may change devices</p><p>MSR Pocket Rocket (Again, I may do a different burner depending on conditions)</p><p>Snowpeak Trek 1400 Titanium (Lightweight cooking pot)</p><p>Goal Zero Venture 30 solar kit (Solar panel so that I can charge phone, gps, and lights along the way)</p><p>Pearl Izumi Elite Softshell shoe covers (It will be cold in Colorado, and possibly wet)</p><p>Schwalbe Marathon plus tour bike tires (My tires and tubes are just about at the end of their life, time for new ones!)</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Lastly, is there anything that you will be giving back?</u></strong> For future trips I would very much like to do vlogs along the way, and I also have interest in biking for a specific cause, though I still would like to do research on that front. However, for this trip, my return will be a little bit more meager. No matter if you donate or not, definetly follow my Strava account which will show my progress everyday. As soon as I have Strava set up I will link it. If you donate 20$ or more then I will send you a postcard from somewhere along my journey. If you donate 70$ or more then you will get a postcard, and an “Artifact” from my trip. This artifact could range anywhere from a cool rock that I find, a picture that I take specifically for you, something unique that I find along the way, or maybe something else? The point is that it will be something catered just for you. For a 150$ donation I will send you a private email or text everyday talking about my adventure thus far. Keep in mind that there will be days that I will not have reception, but I will contact you as soon as I am able. The 250$ donation will get you everything above and then some. Not only will you receive a postcard, ""Artifact"", and personalized message every day, but you will also have access to my Strava beacon! This means that no matter what time, day or night, you will be able to track my every location! It will be as if you are right alongside me! However, be aware that there are only two of these perks available because Strava only allows up to 3 people to have access to the beacon, so supplies are extremely limited!  And the last donation level of 500$ (Don’t freak out, I don’t expect anyone to donate this individually) will of course get a postcard, an “Artifact”, and I will specifically design and plan a bike tour to come visit you wherever you may be. If you are planning on donating this amount I ask that you chat with me first so that we could discuss such a trip!</p><p>            Again, I want to give everyone a huge thank you.

Tolkien</p></div>","Dustin’s Phoenix Bike Tour!             Hey Friends and Family! I just wanted to start off by giving a big thank you for stopping by my Indiegogo page! I know that it is easy to get caught up in our lives, and I know that there are probably some of you that I have not spoken to in a while (we have to fix this error). I think it goes without saying that we often need to slow things down in order to appreciate our surroundings and each other, this is precisely why I am doing a bike tour from Denver Colorado to Phoenix Arizona. I also want to reiterate that if you are unable to, or choose not to back my trip that it is totally fine to check out what I am doing, and what adventures lie ahead. I hope too that my trip might inspire others to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. For the next few minutes I would like to do a quick overview of how I got into this adventure, and a brief outline of what I am doing, and where I am going. After that we will sum up what your donations will do for me, and lastly, what your donations will get you (I know that what I will be giving back is a bit meager, but I still hope that you enjoy it). What the heck am I doing, and how did I get into this mess? Both good questions! I am going to be riding my bicycle from the small town of Castle Rock near Denver to Phoenix Arizona. Most of my ride will be cutting through the southern part of the Rocky Mountains where I will then cycle through the Northwest portion of the Navajo Nation in New Mexico. I decided on Phoenix for a couple of reasons, the main one being that my brother Devan just moved out there last year and I want to go see him and Shannon and my nieces. I have also not explored this region of the United States very much and what better way to see it than on the saddle of a bicycle!!    But how did I decide to do this? Well last May I sold my vehicle and decided that I would commute to work full time and use my bicycle as my primary means of transportation. I ended the year with over 1200 miles commuted to work, not to mention cycling that I did on my free days. Needless to say I immediately fell in love with cycling and decided to try bike packing. Bikepacking is essentially backpacking but cycling instead of hiking (for the most part). I found this to be even more enjoyable than traditional backpacking because of the opportunities it opened to see more places and meet more people in a shorter amount of time. Immediately I began doing research on bike touring (mostly sticking to paved roads) and thus my trip to Phoenix spawned from that research! How long is my trip going to take? What will I be doing along the way? Expecting that I will take a day or two off from biking during my tour then I should be arriving on my 14th or 15th day. This is dependent on my pace of course, and it may alter slightly, but two week would be my goal! My daily average should hopefully be about 60 or 65 miles per day, however, some days that I have steep hill climbs will be much lower.Along the way I will mostly be camping with the exception of a few days where I will be staying with a host family and another day where I will be staying at a cheap hotsprings to get a much needed break from my hardest days of cycling.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">We get it, picking a pair of skates for this winter is an exciting but challenging task. We are here to help! Below, you will find a breakdown of the skates we offer! If you have any additional questions you can chat with us at usasleddogs.com or email us at info@d49ak.com. </p>
<p><strong>Halden : </strong>Our trusty intro skate, the Halden is great for beginners and youth. Its dependable design with flexible sizing offers the best option for this group. Beginners, are defined by us as anyone entirely new to winter sports or to skating on ice. If you are an advanced ice skater, roller blader or inline hockey player you are already good at skating on snow and just don't know it yet so Halden would not be a great option for you. However, if you have very limited experience skating on ice and or haven't been to the slopes before Halden is perfect for you.</p>
<p><strong>Lunde : </strong>The Lunde is very popular with the ladies as it is equipped with an ultra soft inner liner, aluminum buckles and stylish exterior. It is great for both beginners and intermediate riders. Most customers who buy this skate love the extra comforts and are figure skaters and or enjoy just touring the slopes in style.</p>
<p><strong>Hygen :</strong> The Hygen is part of our intermediate/advanced skate lineup. Great for both men and women, the Hygen is a charger. Aggressive down the slopes its stiffer profile gives the rider access to more speed and tighter turns. An excellent choice for intermediate/advanced on ice skaters i.e. hockey players, figure skaters and advanced recreational skaters.  </p>
<p><strong>K9.02 :</strong> Designed for the true mad dog, the K9.02 is built for speed and performance. It comes equipped with a heat moldable EPS liner, shock absorbing insole and all aluminum hardware. It is the top choice of advanced on/off ice skaters.</p>

We get it, picking a pair of skates for this winter is an exciting but challenging task. We are here to help! Below, you will find a breakdown of the skates we offer! If you have any additional questions you can chat with us at usasleddogs.com or email us at info@d49ak.com. 
Halden : Our trusty intro skate, the Halden is great for beginners and youth. Its dependable design with flexible sizing offers the best option for this group. Beginners, are defined by us as anyone entirely new to winter sports or to skating on ice. If you are an advanced ice skater, roller blader or inline hockey player you are already good at skating on snow and just don't know it yet so Halden would not be a great option for you. However, if you have very limited experience skating on ice and or haven't been to the slopes before Halden is perfect for you.
Lunde : The Lunde is very popular with the ladies as it is equipped with an ultra soft inner liner, aluminum buckles and stylish exterior. It is great for both beginners and intermediate riders. Most customers who buy this skate love the extra comforts and are figure skaters and or enjoy just touring the slopes in style.
Hygen : The Hygen is part of our intermediate/advanced skate lineup. Great for both men and women, the Hygen is a charger. Aggressive down the slopes its stiffer profile gives the rider access to more speed and tighter turns. An excellent choice for intermediate/advanced on ice skaters i.e. hockey players, figure skaters and advanced recreational skaters.  
K9.02 : Designed for the true mad dog, the K9.02 is built for speed and performance. It comes equipped with a heat moldable EPS liner, shock absorbing insole and all aluminum hardware. It is the top choice of advanced on/off ice skaters.

It began with a simple and efficient way to dry and hold gear while on the go. Since then, our product line has expanded to include dry bags &amp; duffels, backpack coolers, parkas &amp; changing robes, seat covers, and fishing apparel. Malo’o products are proprietary, patented, manufactured to the highest standards, and sold throughout the world.  </p><h1>THE LOUNGERS </h1><p>We’re Phil Kelly, founder and owner of Malo’o, Chris Crawford, founder, and inventor of RinseKit. We are avid adventurers and also like spending time outdoors with our families. Who knew that walking barefoot over razor-sharp rocks – while carrying a surfboard – would be easier than hauling toys and snacks for a family beach day? Ok, maybe that’s an exaggeration, but you get the picture. </p><p>With several companies and many successful products developed between the two of us, we got to work together on something new. Something that would change the way we carried our stuff and how we enjoyed our time once we got there. </p><div data-id=""29773793""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-lounge-wagon/x/24598618#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1599170191/ngqiwoaw8zfie4hwbeqd.jpg"" src=""""/></a></figure></div><h1>THE IDEA</h1><p>It all began with trying to take beach chairs, towels, coolers, bags, sand toys, boogie boards, umbrellas, and a 5 and 1-year-old to the beach. Let’s face it; if you have kids, you’ve been there. </p><p>We’re both surfers who’ve traveled the world for the perfect wave, but going to the beach with groms is a totally different story. We knew we needed to bring innovation and efficiency to this problem—a new way to haul our gear and enjoy our time outdoors. </p><p>A wagon that wasn’t just a wagon. It needed to be durable, collapsible, and easy to use. It definitely needed all-terrain wheels so it could be easily pulled through the sand or over rocks. And it needed a way to keep everything in place. A bonus if it was easy to put things in and take them out. We also wanted to seat two adults, provide them with shade, and have places to store personal items. </p><p>We had our list of requirements, so we started designing and ultimately developed Lounge Wagon: a 3-in-1 utility wagon, double chair, and umbrella.  </p><div data-id=""30014738""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-lounge-wagon/x/24598618#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1599170192/rxdsklnlux5taceawzb5.jpg"" src=""""/></a></figure></div><div data-id=""29864357""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-lounge-wagon/x/24598618#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1599170193/wkvp4aq4klw6qlq4f3gr.jpg"" src=""""/></a></figure></div><div data-id=""29840399""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-lounge-wagon/x/24598618#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1599170193/qkilsthbpuumhg1i4fay.jpg"" src=""""/></a></figure></div><h1>DURABLE WAGON. COMFORTABLE CHAIR. </h1><p>The design process started with putting together computer models of what we wanted to build. We had to figure out how the cart sides would convert into a chair or fold away. Then we worked on the chassis (the base frame for the wheels) and the steering mechanism. We took our time with determining the best wheels for sand and other rocky surfaces. Next came the balance. We needed to make sure the seat held two full-size adults and wouldn’t tip over. </p><div data-id=""29820515""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-lounge-wagon/x/24598618#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1599170194/gzwjs7ppdfurvxgxgzlx.png"" src=""""/></a></figure></div><p>We made prototypes and added real-time info on what worked and what didn’t.  Our prototype was a great chair but lacked some of the wagon utility we wanted. Our second was a better wagon but we took a step back on the lounging comfort. We kept improving each area through the next several prototypes until we had a working prototype that met our goals. </p><p>We’re proud of what we’ve developed. Still, We are committed to continually make improvements throughout this Kickstarter campaign,  the manufacturing period, and the extensive QC period so that you receive the best Lounge Wagon possible.

Plenty of shade for both people. </p><p><strong><span>Made to Move </span></strong></p><p>When it comes to sand and uneven terrain, many wagons can’t hack it.

Pull up the side of the Lounge Wagon to form the cart. Fold it down for the base of the chair when you’re ready to relax.

The durable 600D polyester fabric sides securely store your goods, and the bright blue color looks good too. You’ll be rolling up in style (see what we did there?).

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot ship to these locations currently due to freight costs. </p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong><br/>This isn’t our first rodeo. Both inventors of Lounge Wagon have had successful Kickstarter campaigns (Chris Crawford for RinseKit, Phil Kelly for Malo'o). And both campaigns delivered all products to all of the campaign supporters. Additionally, we have thousands of customers in countries worldwide and are experienced in bringing new products to the market. Together, we’ve developed and delivered hundreds of different products with our production and design partners over the last several years. We know what it takes to make quality products, bring them to market and deliver them to customers. We may be two Southern California surfers, but we also get the job done and put in the office hours.</p>
<p>We are utilizing exacting manufacturing standards and materials, but there are risks and challenges with any new product. We are taking every measure to control what we can, but there are some things out of everyone’s control with anything in life. Some possible worst-case scenarios: the factory could close due to the pandemic, the freight containers could be lost at sea, or some other unpredictable event could delay production or Lounge Wagon delivery. Quality Control is super important to us, so if there are any ,QC issues, it could extend the delivery times.</p>
<p>These conditions are extreme and ones that every product potentially faces. That’s why a dedicated support team that will always go above and beyond is in place to find a solution. Lounge Wagon has gone through several iterations, and concrete plans are now in place for its production. We have CAD files. We have a manufacturer lined up. We are confident that we will be able to deliver a product that will live up to the demands of your next adventure, even if that’s trekking across a blazing hot parking lot and three football fields of sand to find the perfect spot.</p>

We knew there had to be a better way, so we created it. Lounge Wagon is a 3-in-1 sports wagon, double chair, and umbrella that makes hauling all your gear simple so you can sit back and enjoy when you get there. • Durable, all-terrain utility wagon large enough to hold your gear• Comfortable double beach chair with head and armrests• Double wide umbrella for complete shade• Large, sport wheels that roll easily over sand, dirt, gravel, or uneven roadway• Removable netting system to keep everything in its place• Folds flat and buckles closed for easy transport – compact enough to fit in most car trunks, SUVs, or that minivan • Multiple pockets and storage spots to hold phones, drinks, keys, wallets, and more  ABOUT MALO'OMalo’o was started in early 2016 with a mission to help outdoor adventurers enjoy more of what they love doing through durable, portable, and versatile outdoor gear. It began with a simple and efficient way to dry and hold gear while on the go. Since then, our product line has expanded to include dry bags & duffels, backpack coolers, parkas & changing robes, seat covers, and fishing apparel. Malo’o products are proprietary, patented, manufactured to the highest standards, and sold throughout the world.  THE LOUNGERS We’re Phil Kelly, founder and owner of Malo’o, Chris Crawford, founder, and inventor of RinseKit. We are avid adventurers and also like spending time outdoors with our families. Who knew that walking barefoot over razor-sharp rocks – while carrying a surfboard – would be easier than hauling toys and snacks for a family beach day? Ok, maybe that’s an exaggeration, but you get the picture. With several companies and many successful products developed between the two of us, we got to work together on something new. Something that would change the way we carried our stuff and how we enjoyed our time once we got there. THE IDEAIt all began with trying to take beach chairs, towels, coolers, bags, sand toys, boogie boards, umbrellas, and a 5 and 1-year-old to the beach. Let’s face it; if you have kids, you’ve been there. We’re both surfers who’ve traveled the world for the perfect wave, but going to the beach with groms is a totally different story. We knew we needed to bring innovation and efficiency to this problem—a new way to haul our gear and enjoy our time outdoors. A wagon that wasn’t just a wagon. It needed to be durable, collapsible, and easy to use. It definitely needed all-terrain wheels so it could be easily pulled through the sand or over rocks. And it needed a way to keep everything in place. A bonus if it was easy to put things in and take them out. We also wanted to seat two adults, provide them with shade, and have places to store personal items. We had our list of requirements, so we started designing and ultimately developed Lounge Wagon: a 3-in-1 utility wagon, double chair, and umbrella.  DURABLE WAGON. COMFORTABLE CHAIR. The design process started with putting together computer models of what we wanted to build. We had to figure out how the cart sides would convert into a chair or fold away. Then we worked on the chassis (the base frame for the wheels) and the steering mechanism. We took our time with determining the best wheels for sand and other rocky surfaces. Next came the balance. We needed to make sure the seat held two full-size adults and wouldn’t tip over. We made prototypes and added real-time info on what worked and what didn’t.  Our prototype was a great chair but lacked some of the wagon utility we wanted. Our second was a better wagon but we took a step back on the lounging comfort. We kept improving each area through the next several prototypes until we had a working prototype that met our goals. We’re proud of what we’ve developed. Still, We are committed to continually make improvements throughout this Kickstarter campaign,  the manufacturing period, and the extensive QC period so that you receive the best Lounge Wagon possible. We will be posting improvements and updates throughout the process. SPECS  Lounge Wagon measures 45” long, 23” wide, 23” high, and stands 34” tall from the bottom of the wheels to the top of the sides. The umbrella is 32” high and 10 feet wide! Plenty of shade for both people. Made to Move When it comes to sand and uneven terrain, many wagons can’t hack it. Lounge Wagon’s all-terrain rubber wheels are made to move across sand, dirt, and rocky pavement so it can easily steer and haul your gear almost anywhere you go. Easy Set-UpNo Ph.D. is required. Pull up the side of the Lounge Wagon to form the cart. Fold it down for the base of the chair when you’re ready to relax. The included cargo netting securely stores items, and the UPF 50+ umbrella attaches easily at the back of the chair. Built to LastLounge Wagon is made from corrosion-resistant materials and designed to hold up to 500 lbs. The durable 600D polyester fabric sides securely store your goods, and the bright blue color looks good too. You’ll be rolling up in style (see what we did there?). As a wagon, it’s made for strength and durability. As a chair, it’s comfortable and stable for two full-grown adults – no tipping over!  REWARDSWe need your help – back Lounge Wagon today! We believe in our product and think it is the best way to haul your gear and enjoy more of what you love to do. Be among the first to get your own Lounge Wagon (including umbrella and cargo net) with the pledge amounts below.Take it easy with Lounge Wagon: the 3-in-1 utility wagon, double beach chair, and umbrella.

Now, it's just one! I still have the youngest in my arms, but the wagon is so easy to pull, it's not an issue. Thanks, Lounge Wagon!                                                                                    - Ash W., Laguna Beach, CA""We bought 3 different wagons before trying the Lounge Wagon. They either didn't hold enough, could not make it through the sand with a load, or didn't work. The Lounge Wagon is great with how it converts to a double-seat and umbrella… a great idea. Bonus: great for our kid's sporting events too!”                 - Nate S., San Diego, CA""...amazing, I figured the seat would be uncomfortable as it looks more like a wagon...was I wrong. Good job, guys, I can sit here for hours!""    - Nick K., Scottsdale, AZ.

Unfortunately, we cannot ship to these locations currently due to freight costs. 
Risks and ChallengesThis isn’t our first rodeo. Both inventors of Lounge Wagon have had successful Kickstarter campaigns (Chris Crawford for RinseKit, Phil Kelly for Malo'o). And both campaigns delivered all products to all of the campaign supporters. Additionally, we have thousands of customers in countries worldwide and are experienced in bringing new products to the market. Together, we’ve developed and delivered hundreds of different products with our production and design partners over the last several years. We know what it takes to make quality products, bring them to market and deliver them to customers. We may be two Southern California surfers, but we also get the job done and put in the office hours.
We are utilizing exacting manufacturing standards and materials, but there are risks and challenges with any new product. We are taking every measure to control what we can, but there are some things out of everyone’s control with anything in life. Some possible worst-case scenarios: the factory could close due to the pandemic, the freight containers could be lost at sea, or some other unpredictable event could delay production or Lounge Wagon delivery. Quality Control is super important to us, so if there are any ,QC issues, it could extend the delivery times.
These conditions are extreme and ones that every product potentially faces. That’s why a dedicated support team that will always go above and beyond is in place to find a solution. Lounge Wagon has gone through several iterations, and concrete plans are now in place for its production. We have CAD files. We have a manufacturer lined up. We are confident that we will be able to deliver a product that will live up to the demands of your next adventure, even if that’s trekking across a blazing hot parking lot and three football fields of sand to find the perfect spot.

<h3>Outdoor Recovery Project</h3>
<p>The OUTDOOR RECOVERY PROJECT seeks to add spiritual, emotional and physical wellness to the lives of persons recovering from alcoholism and addiction through meaningful outdoor recreation and adventure. This includes, hiking, kayaking, canoeing, cross country and downhill skiing, and snowboarding. We have the skills to teach and guide we just lack the funds to get moving.</p>
<p>Many in recovery face the challenging task of finding meaningful activities in new lives free from alcohol and drugs. Adding to this, many in the recovering community simply don’t know where to start when working to fully enjoy a life free of alcohol and drugs. Still others simply lack the knowledge or tools at hand to engage in outdoor recreational activities. That’s why we’re here… we’re here to help, we’re here to have fun!</p>

<p>The funds will specifically be used for gear rentals and expenses for hiking, skiing, kayaking, canoeing, and taking recovering folk on day ski and snowboarding trips. We provide the transportation, guiding, and training but for now we'll need to rent the gear.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The OUTDOOR RECOVERY PROJECT arose from the need to take a more holistic approach to personal recovery by embracing the often overlooked physical element of health. A small group of recovering addicts and alcoholics recognized the many benefits of recreation, outdoor adventure, fellowship, and fitness when added to a program of recovery. They then sought deeper fellowship through outdoor experiences and worked to find a way to share this with other recovering alcoholics and addicts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Outdoor recreation and adventure has been shown to improve the lives of recovering persons and aid in relapse prevention.</li>
<li>Our leadership group is comprised of avid hikers, cyclists, kayaking enthusuasts, skiiers, snowboarders, triathletes and runners. We're made up entirely of recovering persons.</li>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am a 22 year-old business student and entrepreneur. I am passionate about innovation, social events, and fresh thinking!</p>
<h3>Here's the deal:</h3>
<p>Fishing is awesome. Snagging lures is not. Being an experienced fisherman myself, I have experienced this problem first-hand and created the Break Away Coupling to solve it. The Break Away Coupling is fully designed, patented, and ready for manufacturing. With your help I can build it and bring it to market!</p>
<h3>Problem/Solution</h3>
<p>Snagging lures is time consuming, expensive, and has a negative impact on the environment (we've all seen tangled fishing line next to a lake or river.)</p>
<p>BUT, the Break Away Coupling will solve these problems by causing the hook to break off the lure at a pre-determined rate of tension! Meaning, you only lose the hook, not the entire lure. Hooks are 50x cheaper to replace than lures, and the Speed Snap design allows fishermen to re-attach a new hook in under 10 seconds!</p>
<p>A question I'm often asked is this: If I catch a big fish will I lose it? No. Simply set your drag beneath the breaking point of the coupling and you will never lose fish because if this product. </p>
<h3>Why do I need your help?</h3>
<p>Prototyping is expensive per-piece because it is generally a small quantity being produced. However, with your help, I will be able to raise enough enough funds and validate the market to attract larger investment funds. With this money I can bring the cost of the product down to a much more reasonable level.</p>
<p>If you think this product deserves a chance on the market, contribute to it!</p>
<p>Since I need money for inventory, anybody who helps me by giving at least $5 will get a sample of my product shipped to them (shipping is included in the cost, the lure is not!).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If my goal of 5000 units is not reached, any funds raised will go towards producing product for lab and field testing. Or, give me an idea for how YOU think it should be spent!</p>

</div><blockquote style=""text-align: center;"">Mike Westra, our Trail Program Director, sitting on a shiny new Kubota excavator.<br/>
</blockquote>We usually rent a machine or two for each project, 
but we now have enough work that owning a machine makes good financial 
sense.  This isn't just spending, it's an investment in future 
singletrack for you.<br/><br/>The Olallie State Park project will be at 
high elevation and a major break down could mean paying tens of 
thousands of dollars to helicopter the machine out.  Now is the time
 for an ultra-reliable new machine.<b><br/></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438646678/x4lb7xzbct7p1qmpisit.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Help us buy a Kubota KX018 Excavator<br/>
</h3>The new excavator, custom thumb, frost ripper and tax will cost $35,259.  This is with a 14% nonprofit/government discount from Kubota. The trailer will be around $4000, maybe less if we can find used one.  Total cost is $39,259.<br/><br/>We are getting the model with an enclosed cab and heater so crews can work through miserable winter conditions and build trail year round.  It is a 2 ton mini-excavator, and track width is adjustable from 4’3” down to 3’3”, allowing for both stability on steep slopes and narrow trail.<br/><br/>Our goal is to raise <i>at least</i> $20,000, and Evergreen will cover the other half of the cost from our general fund.  <br/><br/>Let's think even bigger!  If we raise $30,000, we'll also buy a UTV such as a Gator to get our crews and gear in and out of remote trail building sites.<br/><br/><div align=""center"">
<b>We're going to build you a lot of new singletrack!<br/><br/></b>
</div><b><i>August 12 Update:</i>  The plan to buy two excavators.<br/></b>
<p>We’ve been doing detailed planning for our
upcoming projects, and it’s become clear that buying a second excavator is the
smart thing to do for Evergreen, and we’ve found a way to do it.<span>  So you heard this right, <b>we’re buying two excavators</b>.</span></p>
<p>We are going to purchase a second
KX018 excavator of the same model/specs, receiving about $3.5k discount for
purchasing them together. This makes sense for maintenance and common spare
parts.</p>
<p>We'll have up to five excavators
running at a time over the next two years.  We'll rent any additional
excavators from Hertz, which has been a great partner of ours through their US
Communities program for nonprofits.</p>
<p>We'll put approximately $40,000 down
of the total $75,500 cost and finance the balance with two-year
financing.  Any funds we raise beyond $20,000 will increase the down
payment, and the balance of funds will be paid out of Evergreen's general fund.
The machines will have an expected 8-10 year life under the conditions that we
operate.  </p>
<p>Buying the two machines is an
investment in our trails programs and compared to renting we will recover the
cost within the first 2-3 years.  We will continue to rent additional
machines we need beyond the two we own, depending on project needs.  This
hits the right balance for us of the good economics of owning, cash management,
and the flexibility of renting.  After the current 2-3 year surge in
projects we're confident we can keep two machines running.</p>

Update, August 12:  We've been meeting and doing detailed project planning.  We've made the decision to buy two excavators.   The total cost for two machines is $75,000, we'll use donated funds, general funds from Evergreen, and financing to buy them (see below for details).This decision was an easy one due to a combination of the amazing support from this fundraiser, and the economics of renting versus buying.  Read further down for more details on the revised plan.  Thank you for your support!We are a highly effective nonprofit dedicated to creating and protecting mountain bike opportunities in Washington State.  We just announced five new trail projects for a total of 60 miles of new singletrack over the next two years.  The trail construction is starting right now.  It's time for Evergreen to buy two reliable, new excavators of our own. 

Mike Westra, our Trail Program Director, sitting on a shiny new Kubota excavator.
We usually rent a machine or two for each project, 
but we now have enough work that owning a machine makes good financial 
sense.  This isn't just spending, it's an investment in future 
singletrack for you.The Olallie State Park project will be at 
high elevation and a major break down could mean paying tens of 
thousands of dollars to helicopter the machine out.  Now is the time
 for an ultra-reliable new machine.Help us buy a Kubota KX018 Excavator
The new excavator, custom thumb, frost ripper and tax will cost $35,259.  This is with a 14% nonprofit/government discount from Kubota. The trailer will be around $4000, maybe less if we can find used one.  Total cost is $39,259.We are getting the model with an enclosed cab and heater so crews can work through miserable winter conditions and build trail year round.  It is a 2 ton mini-excavator, and track width is adjustable from 4’3” down to 3’3”, allowing for both stability on steep slopes and narrow trail.Our goal is to raise at least $20,000, and Evergreen will cover the other half of the cost from our general fund.  Let's think even bigger!  If we raise $30,000, we'll also buy a UTV such as a Gator to get our crews and gear in and out of remote trail building sites.
We're going to build you a lot of new singletrack!
August 12 Update:  The plan to buy two excavators.
We’ve been doing detailed planning for our
upcoming projects, and it’s become clear that buying a second excavator is the
smart thing to do for Evergreen, and we’ve found a way to do it.  So you heard this right, we’re buying two excavators.
We are going to purchase a second
KX018 excavator of the same model/specs, receiving about $3.5k discount for
purchasing them together. This makes sense for maintenance and common spare
parts.
We'll have up to five excavators
running at a time over the next two years.  We'll rent any additional
excavators from Hertz, which has been a great partner of ours through their US
Communities program for nonprofits.
We'll put approximately $40,000 down
of the total $75,500 cost and finance the balance with two-year
financing.  Any funds we raise beyond $20,000 will increase the down
payment, and the balance of funds will be paid out of Evergreen's general fund.
The machines will have an expected 8-10 year life under the conditions that we
operate.  
Buying the two machines is an
investment in our trails programs and compared to renting we will recover the
cost within the first 2-3 years.  We will continue to rent additional
machines we need beyond the two we own, depending on project needs.  This
hits the right balance for us of the good economics of owning, cash management,
and the flexibility of renting.  After the current 2-3 year surge in
projects we're confident we can keep two machines running.

<p><br/> KaytLyn is the inspiration and drive for this campaign. Her dream is to travel around the world helping those in need. At 12 years old she has some pretty high goals, and is very compassionate for others. Last fall we learned of a mission group ""Never the Same Mission"" through our church. KaytLyn listened intently to the speaker and her words filled her mind and heart with a desire to attend one of these trips.</p>
<p>I am too protective to send my little girl out of the country without momma, and quite honestly the images and words that were spoken about this sent my mind on a whirlwind of thoughts and ideas, also.

<p>By helping fund this trip you are doing so much more than helping pay for us to travel. It goes far beyond the idea that we get to see foreign land and meet new people. Your help is giving way to a dream; a future. KaytLyn has a passion for helping others. Please help me in supporting her and the desire to follow God's command for her. She talks of being a missionary someday, and I believe that this is only the beginning.</p>
<p>The total cost of the trip will be approximately $6000 for both of us to attend:</p>

<p>Airfare to and from Miami, FL</p>

<p>While in Peru we will visit schools, orphanages, poverty-stricken neighborhoods, parks, markets, and other community areas and meet the people of Lima. We will be providing them with drama ministry as well as completing service projects in their neighborhoods.

<p>An everyday carry tool needs to be able to withstand your everyday grind, so we’ve built the Bandit out of some tough stuff: </p>
<ul>
<li>The body is made of Grade 5 Titanium, a metal known for its strength and minimal weight.</li>
<li>The blade is made of hardened AUS-8 Stainless Steel.</li>
<li>The pivot and lever is made of stainless steel as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every component is made with the tightest tolerances, resulting in a strong, sturdy and lightweight knife that will endure the worst.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454204093/jvdupva0oubf49ohhnnu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>How Is it Built?</b></p>
<p>The pivot post and lever is the mechanism that allows for the smooth opening and closing of the blade. It’s crucial to the life of the knife, so we’ve spent extra time ensuring that these parts were machined and cut with tight tolerances to deliver smooth, reliable action. There are no flimsy complicated metal parts. The pivot post can also be tightened as the blade wears to prevent blade play</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454204850/g5e3md58zvcszdcfcnb6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>The Shape</b></p>
<p>I’ve tried other knives of a similar size and found that they were just a novelty. It was tough to get a good grip on the thing for some practical cutting tasks. Other tools like razor blades just won't cut it as they are limited in their tasks and I didn't want to change blades. With the Bandit, functionality is the foremost priority. A fold out blade design, in addition to the lower notch and the flat spine offers you enough real estate for a better grip and provides adequate leverage for more difficult cutting tasks. Other tiny keychain tools do not have sufficient length for proper cutting.</p>
<p>The Bandit Titanium has a modern timeless design that features rounded corners for comfort and increased durability. Jimping (small grooves) found on the spine of the knife promotes grip during more strenuous tasks. At the bottom side, you’ll find the 4mm built-in loop that allows you to attach it to a key ring or lanyard. There is no need for any small split ring attachment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454205175/znebw1y56ggdd43kvzhk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>The Blade</b></p>
<p>The blade is 1.2 inches long and is made from hardened AUS-8 Stainless Steel. The blade is heat treated to 58/60HRC, in addition it will go through a cryogenic process which removes residual stresses and improves wear resistance. We chose this metal for its ability to hold its edge for longer while also being easy to re-sharpen when needed. The blade thickness is a generous 2mm. You will never need to change a blade. Each Bandit is sharpened and ready to use right out of the box.</p>

<p><b>Quality</b></p>

<li>The Bandit is custom manufactured, meticulously machined, and hand finished.</li>
<li>Stainless steel pivot allows for a lifetime of use. </li>
<li>Stainless steel lever mechanism is designed to withstand normal wear and tear. </li>
<li>The blade is made for daily tasks and is ready to use right when you get it. </li>
<li>Screw pivot can be tightened if needed but not any time soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Durability</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely durable with a rust-proof blade that holds a sharper edge for longer. </li>
<li>The body is made of titanium that is strong and lightweight. </li>
<li>Built to last. The Bandit can take a few punches.</li>

<p><b>Comfort</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Small, compact and ultra-light. </li>
<li>Rounded smooth corners to ensure comfort and no wear on pockets.</li>
<li>Doesn’t weigh down your keys, pocket or zipper. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Practicality</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Slim locking blade that takes up minimal space and will not fold back on your fingers. </li>
<li>Adds a productive tool to your everyday carry. </li>
<li>Use it to open boxes or anything that requires more effort than your fingers. </li>
<li>Cut, pry, pop and tighten. </li>
<li>Flip out the blade for instant access in time of need. </li>
<li>It is handy and may get more use than some of your keys. </li>
<li>You will soon discover that it’s now an essential part of your everyday carry. </li>

<p>The Bandit knife is designed to be a basic, do-everything blade that just happens to be housed in a simple eye-catching handle. No unnecessary add-ons, the single blade simply acts as your trusty sidekick in everyday life.</p>

Thank you for your continued support! - Bryce</div></div>","Innovation results from using a little creativity to solve life’s problems. In my case, I needed something small enough to attach to a zipper or keychain yet, sharp enough to slice through daily tasks. And thus, the Bandit Titanium keychain locking pocket knife was born.

At the mere size of your standard house key, the Bandit Titanium is discreet. Slide it in your jeans’ coin pocket. Throw it on your bundle of keys. Heck, attach it to the zipper of your favorite jacket. I've attached one to my zipper of my fishing pouch. This folding knife makes a statement without having to announce it.

Despite its miniature size, the Bandit Titanium can take on tasks that are too big for lesser pocket knives or small cutting tools. It can slice through annoying heat-sealed packaging, cut persistent zip ties, and even whittle a pencil to a nice sharp point.
An everyday carry tool needs to be able to withstand your everyday grind, so we’ve built the Bandit out of some tough stuff: 

The body is made of Grade 5 Titanium, a metal known for its strength and minimal weight.
The blade is made of hardened AUS-8 Stainless Steel.
The pivot and lever is made of stainless steel as well.

Every component is made with the tightest tolerances, resulting in a strong, sturdy and lightweight knife that will endure the worst.

How Is it Built?
The pivot post and lever is the mechanism that allows for the smooth opening and closing of the blade. It’s crucial to the life of the knife, so we’ve spent extra time ensuring that these parts were machined and cut with tight tolerances to deliver smooth, reliable action. There are no flimsy complicated metal parts. The pivot post can also be tightened as the blade wears to prevent blade play

The Shape
I’ve tried other knives of a similar size and found that they were just a novelty. It was tough to get a good grip on the thing for some practical cutting tasks. Other tools like razor blades just won't cut it as they are limited in their tasks and I didn't want to change blades. With the Bandit, functionality is the foremost priority. A fold out blade design, in addition to the lower notch and the flat spine offers you enough real estate for a better grip and provides adequate leverage for more difficult cutting tasks. Other tiny keychain tools do not have sufficient length for proper cutting.
The Bandit Titanium has a modern timeless design that features rounded corners for comfort and increased durability. Jimping (small grooves) found on the spine of the knife promotes grip during more strenuous tasks. At the bottom side, you’ll find the 4mm built-in loop that allows you to attach it to a key ring or lanyard. There is no need for any small split ring attachment.

The Blade
The blade is 1.2 inches long and is made from hardened AUS-8 Stainless Steel. The blade is heat treated to 58/60HRC, in addition it will go through a cryogenic process which removes residual stresses and improves wear resistance. We chose this metal for its ability to hold its edge for longer while also being easy to re-sharpen when needed. The blade thickness is a generous 2mm. You will never need to change a blade. Each Bandit is sharpened and ready to use right out of the box.

Blade thickness - 2mm with no blade changing & easy to re-sharpen
Made with hardened AUS-8 stainless steel

Quality

The Bandit is custom manufactured, meticulously machined, and hand finished.
Stainless steel pivot allows for a lifetime of use. 
Stainless steel lever mechanism is designed to withstand normal wear and tear. 
The blade is made for daily tasks and is ready to use right when you get it. 
Screw pivot can be tightened if needed but not any time soon.

Durability

Extremely durable with a rust-proof blade that holds a sharper edge for longer. 
The body is made of titanium that is strong and lightweight. 
Built to last. The Bandit can take a few punches.


Comfort

Small, compact and ultra-light. 
Rounded smooth corners to ensure comfort and no wear on pockets.
Doesn’t weigh down your keys, pocket or zipper. 

 Practicality

Slim locking blade that takes up minimal space and will not fold back on your fingers. 
Adds a productive tool to your everyday carry. 
Use it to open boxes or anything that requires more effort than your fingers. 
Cut, pry, pop and tighten. 
Flip out the blade for instant access in time of need. 
It is handy and may get more use than some of your keys. 
You will soon discover that it’s now an essential part of your everyday carry. 

The Bandit knife is designed to be a basic, do-everything blade that just happens to be housed in a simple eye-catching handle. No unnecessary add-ons, the single blade simply acts as your trusty sidekick in everyday life.


Why you need a small pocket knife?
 How many times have you been in a situation where you’ve said to yourself, “Heck, a knife would be really handy now!” Here are a few instances when a pocket knife can come in handy or just make the simple things in life more enjoyable: 

Open boxes 
Open letters 
Cut zip ties 
Cut cordage or twine 
Trim loose thread 
Sharpen a stick or a pencil 
Cut, pick, pry - many uses 
General small tasks



INDIEGOGO Price $36 Includes US Shipping
Retail Price $40 
Invest in a knife that you are proud to show off, is comfortable in your pocket, and one that reflects personality. A tiny little pocket knife that feels good in your hand, that you’ll take pride in and want to carry around plus won’t break the bank. It's tiny and titanium!

 </h3>We went through countless iterations of robots - constantly tweaking the 
proportions to maximize stability, range of motion, and ease of maneuverability.  Our final design 
stands just under 1m (38"") H with a base of just 32cm W x 35.5cm L (12.5"" x 14"").  This allows it to 
easily traverse even the most confined<br/><p>
of spaces with the perfect reach just just over standard kitchen counters and door knobs/dead 
bolts.  Although it looks top heavy, you can see in the video that it is extremely stable even at 
full extension and payload.  This is due to a very low center of gravity and hefty mass of 3.35kg (7.4lbs) centered near the rear of the robot.<br/></p>

ORIGIBOT Is a Dream Come True""""We may not have robots roaming the streets quite yet, but if the Origibot has anything to do with it, that will soon become a reality""""the Origibot, a telepresence device that is not only functional, it’s affordable too.""What is ORIGIBOT?ORIGIBOT is a fully robotic platform that pairs with your Android 
phone or tablet (running our free App) to become a complete telepresence
 solution.  You connect remotely to ORIGIBOT from anywhere in the world 
on most any device with an Internet connection (Android, iOS, Windows, 
Mac).  Since it uses WebRTC technology, the
 web interface is simple and light (doesn't require any additional 
plugins or java applets).  It's also fast and responsive with minimal 
lag over broadband connections.Not only do you have two-way audio and video, but also full control of 
the robotic platform, arm, and gripper.  How awesome is that?  A full 5 
degrees of freedom (including the robot base) to interact with the 
remote environment!By leveraging your existing device as its communications hub, display, 
and camera, we were able to create something awesome at a great price.  
Also, because its Android, this opens the door to unlimited applications
 and future enhancements from users and the community.Here are just some things ORIGIBOT can do:








Featured in:DESIGN:ORIGIBOT is made mostly of sleek aluminum extrusions.  Its minimalist design is all about functionality and strength.  The body and arms are just the right length to be unobtrusive while navigating, yet can reach from a few inches off the ground to just above most counters, door knobs, and refrigerator water dispensers.ORIGIBOT will ship with an updated tablet mount that will accommodate ANY android phone or tablet with up to a 10"" display.  (Our prototype is carrying a 7"" Samsung galaxy tab 3 )



ABS plastic parts were carefully designed for 3D Printing, easy updates, and modifications.  All design files will be made available to contributors.ORIGIBOT's gripper opens to 7.8 cm with a recess to accommodate cans, bottles, and cups.

Motorized wheels are mounted at the optimum location to provide great stability even when carrying payloads.



Standard T-Slot extrusions provide incredible strength and easy customization.
Control:Simple controls via our secure app make controlling ORIGIBOT child's play.  Simply login from any device running Firefox or Chrome browser (supporting WebRTC) and access your ORIGIBOT.  The intuitive joystick control makes maneuvering ORIGIBOT as easy as playing an arcade game: control the base 
forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and stop.  Sliders control 
movements for the Neck, Arm, Wrist and Gripper.  Tilt the neck forward 
and backward to get a better view of the environment.  Lift the arm up 
and down, then turn the wrist to get just the right position.  Open and 
close the gripper to grasp or release.Fully hackable...
ORIGIBOT was built from the ground up using off-the-shelf components including standard and high-torque hobby servos, standard T-Slot aluminum framing, and an Arduino for control.  All custom components are 3D Printed and .stl files will be available for download so you can modify and print replacements yourself.  Its Arduino sketch will also be available so you can add custom commands and tweak parameters yourself.  The ORIGIBOT forum will become a community where fellow enthusiasts can share and collaborate on ideas and enhancements.


What can ORIGIBOT do?(What can I do with ORIGIBOT)?

Unlock a deadbolt                              Open a door
Get water from the fridge                Fill your pet's bowl
Bring Grandma her meds                    Water your plantsRetrieve the remotePatrol your home/officeJoin in on events while awayTurn on/off lights and appliances???


*Please note that this is an experimental robot and cannot be relied upon to 
provide care to any people or pets!What the ORIGIBOT can do is only limited by your imagination (and its hardware of course). Power/Battery:Included NiMh batteries provide about 8 hours of standby time with moderate use.  The included charger will safely recharge the batteries in under 4 hours.  Batteries do not suffer from ""memory"" and will recharge over 1000 cycles.Development/Prototyping...
 We went through countless iterations of robots - constantly tweaking the 
proportions to maximize stability, range of motion, and ease of maneuverability.  Our final design 
stands just under 1m (38"") H with a base of just 32cm W x 35.5cm L (12.5"" x 14"").  This allows it to 
easily traverse even the most confined
of spaces with the perfect reach just just over standard kitchen counters and door knobs/dead 
bolts.  Although it looks top heavy, you can see in the video that it is extremely stable even at 
full extension and payload.  This is due to a very low center of gravity and hefty mass of 3.35kg (7.4lbs) centered near the rear of the robot.



(Special thanks to Makeblock.cc for their awesome robot construction kit!)We custom designed our own gripper with 
just the right balance of cost/size/function.  Our gripper opens wide enough to grab a cup or can of soda and has a unique 
curved shape to get a good grip on whatever you're carrying.
While we made sure to source only standard components 
wherever possible, custom parts were designed for 3D printing.  We printed hundreds of parts while constantly testing & tweaking until we got it 
right.Thanks heavens for RepRap (and Printrbot)!
We ended up with a robust robotic platform made entirely of strong aluminum framing and 3D printed ABS parts.

Our Arduino firmware will be available for download so you can modify it as you 
wish.

Why Indiegogo?
Over the past year, we have made many prototypes and much progress... Now we have a working design that has been tweaked and tested.  We need your help to bring ORIGIBOT to market by bringing manufacturing costs down.  Larger quantity buys and streamlined assembly processes are only possible at the larger volumes made possible by your support!
Can't/don't want to contribute but still think the ORIGIBOT is awesome?  Please help us by spreading the word to all your friends and family!Who are you people anyway?We are makers and doers... We are Engineers and Scientists who love technology, but not just for technology sake.  With backgrounds in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Software Development, and Product Design and Manufacturing, we are well positioned to make this project a success!
 What We Need & What You GetOur campaign goal is just high enough to unlock volume savings with quantities just large enough to make mass assembly feasible.  Every contribution counts and we appreciate every one!  We are offering some great perks for robot enthusiasts at EVERY level:











Production Plan



Risks & Challenges
We have minimized risk by sourcing ONLY standard and 3D Printable parts. Further, we have developed several prototypes and have a fully functional, tested version as you see in the video.  We also have working software and apps.  All we need is to ramp up our order quantities and tweak and refine our UI.

</div></div>","Dave Thomas and Bill Davis have untaken the task of recreating the City of Burbank Streamliner lost in a crash in 1955. The City of Burbank Streamliner was one of the first ""home built"" land speed cars to set national and international speed records in the 1950s 


We are looking for $5000.00 in this campaign to help us build the unique fiberglass body for the streamliner. Participants will recieve various perks comenserate with their contribution.


This racing car represents a significant part of U.S. land speed racing history as well as the early days of hot rodding in America. We are hoping to celebrate the 60 year anniversary of the City of Burbank Streamliner by returning and running again at the Bonneville Salt Flats this August.

<h3>WHY WE START THIS PROJECT</h3>
<p>People love outdoor barbecuing. It is fun and enjoyable for everyone, but the storage, transportation, and cleanup process with normal equipment is dreadful. Campers, for example, require people to store and transport heavy equipment. BISON, in its compact and highly transportable structure allows you to bring an essential cooking platform to enhance your overall outdoor experience. With BISON’s proprietary BBQ grill design that is easy to clean and allows for simple yet flavorful cooking, you are able to cook high quality food for everyone.</p>

<h3><strong> ABOUT PRODUCT</strong></h3>
<p>The BISON Rolling Grill is made for backpacking campers and outdoor enthusiasts. This unique design allows you to roll up the grill into a compact size (from 250 mm 9.85 in x 300 mm 11.8 in to 50 mm 1.97 in x 300 mm 11.8 in). Set up is easy and intuitive; you can start barbecuing in less than a minute. The Rolling Grill Set also includes a size-adjustable stake stand for campfire setups that makes it easy to increase desired heat levels.</p>

<p><i>Ciao</i>! And welcome to my Indiegogo page! As many of you may know, I will be studying abroad in Italy with my University this Summer for 6 weeks! I am so excited, and feel incredibly honored to have been able to receive a few scholarships to help pay for this trip. With that being said, Europe can be expensive for the average college student, and so to help pay for some leftover expenses, I decided to create this funding page. By donating, you not only will help by contributing to this incredible experience I'm about to embark on, but you'll also receive something in return! </p>
<p>For those of you who don't know, I am a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography Major at the University of North Florida. I'm originally from Miami, and love to travel and take photos along the way. I decided Photography was my one true passion, and wanted to be able to study it and better my photographical skills in a learning environment. </p>
<h4>The Perks</h4>

We thought we had to do something!No one should have to avoid going out because of something as minor as a little bit of rain, and we are set on reducing the number of people who do so.To take on the challenge, we have designed VEAR, a sleek and stylish, eco-friendly pair of rain pants that zip up on your body just like a jacket does.VEAR Legs Jacket is loaded with features that will keep you comfortable, dry, and safe on your outdoor trips, so you can arrive at your destination in style!This is not a computer-generated image. It is a real shot of the product in a professional studio
Product Demo - Please wait for the GIF to loadGolf, mountain biking, hiking, motorcycling or pretty much any rainy outdoors activity.VEAR Legs Jacket was inspired by the Scandinavian weather. This outdoor product is made to last and withstand harsh weather conditions. With VEAR, rain will never stop you from going out again!for men and womenVEAR Legs Jacket is packed with different features that will keep you dry and comfortable, and also add durability, so it stays in perfect condition for a long time.
    On the left side we can see a daytime (no flash) photo, while on the right side we have a night photo (with flash).WATERPROOF, WINDPROOF & BREATHABLEWaterproof and windproof, yet still breathable rain pants, giving you that level of comfort you’re looking for. The pants come in two versions - made with a standard type of fabric -good for everyday use in light rain showers, and a high-performance fabric from Sympatex - more durable and best for activities in heavy rains and that require more physical effort; and it also comes with waterproof side zippers.Both fabrics are waterproof, windproof, and breathable but the fabrics' specifications differ from one another.
 ​EASY TO PUT ON & TAKE OFF
​It takes less than 15 seconds to put it on. The legs jacket is made with YKK zippers from top to bottom on both sides. Under normal usage conditions, the zippers won't get wet thanks to our design that redirects the water away from it.
Easy on, easy off: forget stretching and removing shoes. This unique design allows you to transition from road to office in seconds! Cool, right?!Below we made a table to show you how much more efficient you are by using our pants. The ""normal pants"" times were measured including the time it takes to put on and remove the shoes.That is quite an improvement, isn't it?!LIGHTWEIGHT & EASY TO STORE AND CARRYThe back pocket is magic! It doubles as a sack, with a double sided zipper so you can pack the pants inside (in less than 30 seconds). Use the carabiner hook to attach it to your bike or simply put it in your backpack.DURABLE Made to last you a lifetime - VEAR Legs Jacket is manufactured only with premium materials such as YKK zippers - known to be among the best in the world.The pants are seam taped so the water doesn't penetrate the seams. They are also reinforced at the knee level, where you need it most. Crafted for strength and made to last.WATERPROOF FRONT POCKETSREFLECTIVE FEATURES       The special black reflective patterns allow you to look cool during the day and stay safe at night! They are made with tiny glass beads that reflect light back to its source.SHOE PROTECTORADJUSTABLE WAIST STRAPSVEAR Legs Jacket gives your waistline a little bit of leeway during the holiday season. So, go ahead, have that extra piece of Aunt Betty’s pumpkin pie!SLIM DESIGNNot only is the tapered-leg sleek and stylish, it is essential to help keep your feet and socks dry and also prevent your pants from getting stuck in the bicycle chain.ECO-FRIENDLYAt VEAR we believe in sustainable production. This translates to our rain products as well, and you’ll find that the label in every pair proves it.VEAR Legs Jackets are manufactured with sustainability in mind. We will try to minimize the impact on the environment in the process.“Today's linear ‘take, make, dispose’ economic model relies on large quantities of cheap, easily accessible materials and energy, and is a model that is reaching its physical limits. A circular economy is an attractive and viable alternative that businesses have already started exploring today” – Ellen MacArtur FoundationThis is what VEAR stands for! We want to close the loop and be pioneers in the transition towards a circular economy.If you don’t need your product anymore, send it back to us with the sustainability label in place, and we’ll refurbish it or transform it into something else, protecting the environment further. We’ll also give you a 10% discount on your next purchase if you do. Fair enough?!  Although we do not have a direct competitor that would encompass all the features our product has, from a technical point of view our product is comparable to high-end brands.     We'd appreciate a lot if you'd share this with your friends! Don't let them miss this one!  EXCHANGE POLICY: If you follow the sizing chart carefully, the rain pants should suit you well. Still, if you wish to exchange your product for any reason, we will allow you to do that, but you’ll have to pay for the shipping both ways. Due to the fact that we are offering the products at highly discounted prices on Kickstarter, we will not be able to accept returns.After successfully ending the Kickstarter funding period, we will take our final version of the product and start production.Most of the money we are asking for will go for serial production; additionally, some of the proceeds will go towards shipping, packaging, taxes etc.We are working with experienced manufacturers and this is the timeline they informed us about: 400 to 1000 items can be manufactured in 15 to 20 working days, but the custom YKK zippers require an additional 10 days to a total of 38 days. It usually takes two weeks for Kickstarter to release the funds after the campaign ends, therefore we will be able to place the order at the beginning of January 2017 and we already discussed with our manufacturer to reserve the time for us, so they can start production right away. One thing we must also consider is the fact that from Jan. 26th to Feb. 5th is Chinese New Year and factories will not work in that period, therefore another 12 days will add to that 38. We concluded that by 20th of February 2017 the factory will deliver the items and we can start shipping.Any problems shall arise, we also have backup manufacturers and they can deliver by the end of March.Valentin, Andrei & friends in the offline campaign for promoting the product.We are passionate about cycling, a healthy and sustainable method of transportation. Our goal is to get more people to cycle more often, regardless of the climate. To do so, we want to make cycling easy, safe and more enjoyable by tackling the consumer problems related to cycling.How was this product born?“I moved to Denmark where I encountered terrible weather (a lot of wind and rain), so I had to buy a pair of rain pants. I found the one I bought very hard to use: difficult to put on, difficult to take off. If your shoes are dirty then you have to take your shoes off before taking off your pants. It is very annoying and can be a real hassle!I searched endlessly for a product that would solve this problem but couldn’t find anything so I made my own – now I wear them every time it rains! People saw mine and asked me where they could get a pair of their own, so now we’re on Kickstarter…“ – ValentinFollow us and get in touch! Also, don't forget to share!Feel free to add any questions you may have, we are happy to help!   SHIPPING, CUSTOMS & DUTIES INFORMATIONWe have backers from all over the world and in order to avoid logistic problems, we will ship all orders from our manufacturing location in China.Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other taxes but the package will be marked as gift.

  NOTICE: You will select your add-on via a survey that will be sent to you via email 2 weeks after you have made your pledge on Indiegogo. NOMATIC was born and raised on Kickstarter.  In 2014 we launched the BASICS Wallet. Then in 2015 we launched the BASICS Notebook. Thanks to our incredible backers and supporters, over 100,000 people worldwide are now enjoying our products everyday. As our brand has evolved, we have changed our name from BASICS to NOMATIC. Today, with with the help of Indiegogo, we are excited to bring you our most epic product yet, The NOMATIC Travel Bag.  The NOMATIC Travel bag was designed for a 3-7 day trip. By combining the best features from a backpack, duffel bag and general luggage, we have created the ultimate travel bag to help you spend less time fussing with your luggage and more time enjoying your journey. The NOMATIC Travel Bag has over 20 features that make it the most functional travel bag ever. On top of being packed with incredible functionality, the bag has a sleek minimalist design, is made of strong weather-proof materials and is built to last.         Our Innovative strap system allows you to switch between backpack and duffel in seconds and have no dangling straps.        A laundry bag comes with each travel bag to complete the set. When closed, the laundry bag was designed to fit perfectly inside the door of the shoe compartment of your travel bag. When you arrive at your destination, the laundry bag expands and hangs on a door knob so you can easily toss dirty clothes in. When the trip is over and the laundry bag is full, it will fit back into your travel bag perfectly and keep your dirty clothes separate and organized.    The NOMATIC Travel Bag is equipped with an RFID safe pocket and a TSA approved lock. This “mini safe” keeps your scannable and valuable items safe during travel from pickpockets, room service, and other potential threats.Perfect place to safely travel with valuables and RFID scannable items. TSA Approved lock included.  The padded and secure laptop pocket allows you to leave your backpack or laptop bag behind and travel like a pro with just one bag. The laptop pocket can hold a 15"" laptop comfortably. Plus with the airport security friendly design, you won't have to take your laptop out of the pocket. Just open the bag and lay the main compartment door flat (as shown in the second image below) and you will be good to go.    Keep your tablet accessible and safe in this easy access padded pocket found on the inside of the main compartment door. The secure velcro flap was designed with a slot to allow you to charge your tablet on the go with a power bank while keeping it secure.  Located at the top of the bag is a water bottle pocket lined with a water proof material to allow you to stay hydrated on the road while keeping all of your belongings dry in case of a leak.  If you travel with a roller bag, The NOMATIC Travel Bag will be the perfect companion. We have designed a built in durable sleeve to fit over the handle of your roller bag.  The exterior of the NOMATIC Travel Bag is a durable 100% water-proof tarpaulin material. Tarpaulin is commonly used on rugged outdoor bags because of its ability to endure and stay strong in harsh conditions. We have also integrated waterproof zippers into the exterior of the bag to keep your gear protected in the rain and snow. This bag features a large opening into the main compartment which gives you easy access and visibility for packing.  The shoe, socks, and underwear compartments help you to stay organized. In addition, the strong tarpaulin material holds its shape to make packing easier. Put 1 or 2 pairs of shoes in the shoe compartment, and socks, underwear or a light jacket in the upper compartment, and still have plenty of room for everything else.  On the bottom of the bag we have included a shoe compartment where you can easily fit up to two pairs of shoes. (2 pairs of U.S. size 12 fit comfortably inside)  On the top of the bag is a similar compartment to the shoe compartment where you can keep socks, underwear, or even a light jacket for easy access when you get cold while traveling. These compartments were designed to help you organize your packing rather than just stuffing everything into one big pocket like most duffel bags.   At 21"" x 14"" x 9"" inches this bag meets domestic and international carry-on standards.  Keep your phone, sunglasses, and other valuables protected in this soft fleece-lined pocket on the top side of the bag.  With this combination of mesh, fleece-lined, and zipper pockets, you can keep your cords, power banks, laptop chargers and any other odds and ends right where you need them.  The side pocket is sized to hold a BASICS Notebook or any other book of a similar size (roughly 5.5"" x 8.75"")   When the bag is worn in backpack mode, this pocket is easily accessible, making it the perfect place for frequently needed travel documents.  Also, because it is positioned with the zipper close to your back it makes it more difficult for pickpockets to access this zipper undetected.  Carrying your luggage can become painful and heavy, so we added a very comfortable handle to make your interactions with the bag as enjoyable as possible.  Last but not least we have added a sternum strap for added comfort and support.         
The following four accessories are designed to fit perfectly inside the bag and to match the design of the bag to create the perfect travel kit.  To order any of these accessories, first back one of the perks listed on the top right of the page.  After paying for the perk and checking out, you will receive an email that will take you to the survey process that will give you the opportunity to select any of the accessories you would like. Vacuum BagThe NOMATIC Vacuum Bag is both water proof and air tight. This added feature will help you pack all you need in half the space, leaving more room for other travel essentials.    Toiletries Bag Made from the same Tarpaulin material as the Travel Bag, this toiletries bag will last forever and will keep liquid spill inside the toiletries bag and away from your clothes.  Waist StrapTo give you better support when carrying the bag, you can clip on these waist straps to distribute the weight more comfortably.  Also each strap has a pocket big enough to hold your passport for even more functionality. Shirt OrganizerUsing the plastic guide that comes with this accessory, you can fold your shirts to just the right size, then store them in the organizer to avoid wrinkles while traveling. We are confident that we can deliver all NOMATIC Travel Set rewards by February 2017. 
   We love creating innovative products that help people simplify, organize and improve their lives. We are so grateful to all of our backers and supporters who helped us successfully launch the Basics Wallet and Basics Notebook on the Kickstarter Platform.  And now we are also grateful to those who are helping us bring the NOMATIC Travel Bag to life on the Indiegogo platform.  Thanks for all of your support!  If you have any feedback or questions please contact us through our website www.nomatic.com.",83.0,0,"8 Campaigns

Unless they accept payment in the form of hugs in Iceland, we're going to have to hustle our butts off these next two months.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, we set up a shop to sell some fun stuff on the side. Sadly, we only get a very small percentage of the items sold in the shop (<a href=""https://society6.com/nomadicphotomakers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://society6.com/nomadicphotomakers</a>) so this page is to hopefully collect more money while still offering some cool stuff in return.</p>
<p>If you know Lisa and I personally, you know there will be plenty of pretty pics coming your way. You are welcome (and encouraged) to pick a perk so you can have an awesome print or video sent to you~</p>
<p>Lastly, if you're still reading this, thank you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Gabe, Fred, Raquel</p>
<p>Brittni, Brianna</p>
<p>We are undergraduate students from Azusa Pacific University and are all excited about watching God work this summer in Burkina Faso.  The five of us have been preparing for  five months to attend to the needs of the Burkinabe.  In Burkina Faso we will be living with a married missionary couple, Rotimi and Florence.  For six weeks from June 2 to July 12 we will aid them in any way necessary. We are expecting to work in several villages and help build homes and water pumps for clean water.  We will visit orphanages and spend time loving the parentless children of Burkina Faso. We are also preparing to work with the churches of Burkina and share the love of God through music and drama.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our team needs to raise $10,000 by May 22, 2013. The monetary aid that you provide will be used to pay for our arrival, residence and departure saefley from Burkina Faso.  It also goes to any projects that Rotimi and Florence are working on for the Burkinabe. Any and all money that is not used is saved for future mission trips to Burkina Faso.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This trip is about all of us as much as it is about the Burkinabae. God has called us to move and to serve our sisters and brother when no one else will. This willingness and hunger we have to move under God's love is our message to the world. Though God is of infinite power and measure He moves through the faithfullness of His people; so where we go , you go with us. </p>
<p>There is a song that says ""you can never beat God's giving"".  We believe that in return for your selfless giving you will be blessed in return. No good deed is missed by God and no good deed is is left unrewarded. Apart from tangible blessings we believe that the joy  of knowing you have sent your love and support to Burkina Faso through us, is more rewarding than any material gift.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not all who want to are able to give and we want to let anyone in this situation know that your prayers are invaluable.  Prayers for the Burkinabe and their country.  Prayers for Rotimi and Florence. As well as prayers for our team. Spreading the word and sharing our campaign would also be a great help. Thank-you.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What is Cosmic Eye?</b></p>
<p>Cosmic Eye was imagined by an amateur astronomer that was once clueless about the cosmos. The learning curve of astronomy is very high and discourages new entrants into the science. However, if one can begin to understand the basic concepts and fundamentals of the science the beauty and impressive vastness of the universe is revealed. To aid in this learning curve a better viewing experience through a telescope is what Cosmic Eye wishes to accomplish; to expose the true nature of what you see through a telescope.</p>
<p>Astronomy is a science that offers a unique perspective to even the most casual of astronomers. It provides those who understand the fundamentals a special connection with the universe we are all so lucky to perceive and only just beginning to understand.  </p>
<p>Cosmic Eye will utilize augmented reality display within the eyepiece of the telescope itself to overlay information and images that have been taken in different wave lengths of light to expose the true structure of the cosmos.</p>
<p>Different wave lengths of light can indicate different processes and events occurring throughout the cosmos. What can be seen through infrared light for example are regions of space that are active with star formation. Objects like nebula and galaxies can be seen with much better clarity and in more detail when looking at images taken with infrared filters and detectors. To illustrate this The Orion nebula is show below in a simulated view through Cosmic Eye:</p>

Your contribution will not only help increase the likelihood that this product is successful, but also aid in the depth and usability of the software.  </p>
<p>Your aid toward this project could help on two major frontiers. The expansion of the science of astronomy, as well as increasing the contextual understanding of the cosmos to many more people. Not just the simple things, but truly expanding peoples' knowledge and perception of the universe that exists around and within them.</p>
<p>We are made of stardust, to use the phrase coined by famous astronomer Carl Sagan, and we are only the universe trying to understand itself. It is with this understanding that can come many great things, not just in science, but in human affairs as well.

<p>It's simple: Fill the ROCK SOK (neoprene pouch) with a few rocks.  Attach a carabiner and rope. Toss over a tree branch and use the unique pulley system to pull your food up high away from hungry animals. No more knots around rocks. No more struggles to get your rope over a tree branch. No more ropes cutting into the branch leaving your food hanging only a few feet off the ground. </p>

</div></div>","What is the problem?Hanging your food in the backcountry is rudimentary, and can be a hassle. Have you ever tried tying a knot around a rock? It's tough. More often than not, backpackers find themselves struggling to hang their food & gear safely.   What is the solution?The Ultralight Food Hanging System is a complete system that equips you with everything you need to quickly and easily hang your food. It eliminates the struggle of tying a rope around a rock, or the hassle of getting the rope over the branch. It eliminates BFF (Branch Friction Frustration), and its unique pulley system gives you a 2-1 mechanical advantage. Meaning half the pulling force is needed to raise your food bag.   Total weight for this complete system is only 6.5oz.  
How it Works
It's simple: Fill the ROCK SOK (neoprene pouch) with a few rocks.  Attach a carabiner and rope. Toss over a tree branch and use the unique pulley system to pull your food up high away from hungry animals. No more knots around rocks. No more struggles to get your rope over a tree branch. No more ropes cutting into the branch leaving your food hanging only a few feet off the ground.",14.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p style=""font-size:8px;""> </p>
<p><b>How do I order more than one bag?</b></p>
<p>You can only order 1 perk at a time (an Indiegogo limitation) so if you want multiple bags, you need to go through the ordering process multiple times. The downside is that you'll have to pay the shipping fee again, and your shipments will be sent separately. The upside is that you're still getting a great deal!</p>
<p><b>What is the warranty?</b></p>
<p>Lifetime, baby! All Peak Design products carry a lifetime guarantee. That means if any part becomes defective or dysfunctional over time we will repair or replace it free of charge.</p>
<p><b>What is the return policy?</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While all of our products are guaranteed for life, we unfortunately do not offer refunds or returns on items received as Indiegogo perks.</p>
<p>The support we get from our Indiegogo and Kickstarter backers is what enables us to run and grow our business, gather customer feedback, design new products and improve existing ones. In the crowdfunding community, the items that you receive after making a pledge are referred to as ""perks"" or ""rewards"" because they are not purchases in the traditional sense. They are gifts—in our case, sweet bags—that are sent to our supporters as a token of appreciation for their support of our business. In the same way that public television funds their service through the pledges of their supporters, who in turn receive gifts and continued programming, we have chosen to run and grow our business on a crowdfunded business model.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What size laptop will each bag hold?</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Everyday Backpack 20L/30L are designed to hold up to a 15 inch Macbook Pro, 2009 and later models.</p>
<p>The Everyday Sling and Everyday Tote is designed to hold up to a late model 13 inch Macbook Pro Retina.</p>
<p>We speak in terms of Mac models because a) we're based in San Francisco and it's what people do here and b) PC models come in a huge range of sizes. For those with PCs, here are the maximum outer laptop dimensions that our bags can fit:</p>
<p>Everyday Backpack 30L: <br/>16""x10.75""x1.5"" (40x27x4cm)</p>
<p>Everyday Backpack 20L: <br/>15""x9.75""x1"" (38x25x2.5cm)</p>
<p>Everyday Tote: <br/>12.5""x8.65""x.75"" (32x22x2cm)</p>
<p>Everyday Sling: <br/>12.5""x8.65""x.75"" (32x22x2cm)</p>
<p>If your laptop is within a cm of those dimensions, it should still work. But more than that and it probably won’t fit easily or at all.</p>
<p> </p> <b>What size tablet will each bag hold?</b><p> </p>

<p>Everyday Sling**: <br/>12.5""x8.65""x.75"" (32x22x2cm)</p>

The Everyday Backpack (in 20L and 30L), Everyday Sling, and Everyday Tote are the newest additions to the Peak Design lineup. Successfully funded on Kickstarter on September 9th, they are now available for pre-order here on Indiegogo, as well as peakdesign.com and Peak Design retailers worldwide. Like all Peak Design products, our new bags are packed full of features and meticulously engineered. They are designed from the ground up to be both the best camera bags and the best everyday carry on the planet.
 
How to get them
Become a backer of this project. To do that, click on the Perk you want and enter your payment info. Your order will ship once we have finished fulfilling pre-orders made previously on Kickstarter. We expect all Indiegogo pre-orders to be shipped by December 2016.
Note: if you want to pre-order Range Pouch, click one of the pre-order links at the bottom of the Range Pouch section of this page.

Wait, are these camera bags?
Let's make one thing abundantly clear: these ain't just camera bags. They're Everyday bags—crafted by a team of designers, engineers, and photographers to meet the needs of everyone in the modern world. 
We may have cut our teeth in the camera accessories world, but these bags are for everyone, just like our (award-winning*) Everyday Messenger that we designed and launched a year ago with the help of renowned adventure photographer Trey Ratcliff. Peak Design Everyday Bags are unrivaled as camera bags and uncompromising as everyday companions.

                                                                                                                     
 
And now, meet the bags:
 Everyday Backpack

 
Simply put, a backpack without compromises. Available in Charcoal and Ash, and in 20L and 30L sizes. Unless otherwise specified, all pictures are of the 20L Everyday Backpack.
What makes the Everyday Backpack so stacked?

The classic tote bag, completely reimagined to protect, organize, and provide lightning-fast access to your camera gear and everyday carry (think beach, gym, traveling, diapers, etc). Available in Charcoal and Ash.
What makes the Everyday Tote so dope?
 

 

                                                          Everyday Sling

The ultimate low-profile, quick-access day bag for light carry and daily excursions. Makes a great bag for beginning photographers or pros who just want to carry essentials. Also a fantastic option for the non-photographer who just wants a sleek everyday bag. Available in Charcoal and Ash.
What makes the Everyday Sling so bling?

 

                   Range Pouch
The Range Pouch is specifically designed to protect and carry lenses on belts, straps, or in bags, available in three sizes. Like our Everyday Bags, the Range Pouch is intelligently designed, expandable, versatile, and feature-packed.

Then the MAKKER app will log your flying times and your precision progress. It is plug’n’play and works straight out of the box.

You can place the marks inside or outside, on the ground, on the kitchen floor, under a table or in a tree. The great thing is that you can decide how difficult you want your track to be. When the drone passes over a mark it will be indicated by a blue flash as well as clear sound feedback from the app.</p><p>With the MAKKER app you can either choose precision or race mode to monitor your progress and flight times. The app will then help you determine who is fastest or the most precise (they are not the same thing at all) and you can challenge yourself or your friends to beat your own personal best. You can even duplicate tracks from the best drone pilots around the world and compare your flight skills and racing times against theirs.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Get racing</strong></h3><p>The MAKKER app measures the time spent from the first to last mark – it is that easy to get a race going and all the lap and split times are saved so you can monitor your progress.

The story behind MAKKER Mikkel Barker (commercial pilot, flight, and aerobatic instructor)“In November 2016 I bought a Phantom 2 drone to use in my business and spent a great deal of time practicing and developing my flight skills. In this process, I really found I was missing something that could provide the feedback needed to improve.For instance, when I was trying to rotate over the same position in even the mildest summer breeze it was a real challenge and with just a little wind it would be almost impossible.This was the start of MAKKER, to create a tool that would give precise feedback from your drone. MAKKER has taken many forms since then but we have always stuck to the basic concept – to invent an electronic device that can give you real-time feedback from your drone” And the team behind MAKKER From left to right –  Founder, Mikkel Barker, partner Michel Riis, partner Christain Duus.Mikkel Barker: “MAKKER has long been my brainchild and together with the team of dedicated professionals I am very excited to bring MAKKER to the drone community.”Christian Duus: ""Being responsible for the user experience, it is my job to ensure that all development is made with the end-user in mind. I have a background in interaction design and storytelling, and I am super excited to be a part of the MAKKER team.""Michel Riis: “I am responsible for the design of MAKKER and design and quality is extremely important to me. All design decisions have to mean that the user gets the best possible experience. Having worked as a designer for Yamaha Motors my heart is on fire for the race side of MAKKER and I look forward to a lot of racing.” But we are not the only ones!In February this year, MAKKER partnered with Innovation on Wings as well as teaming up with the University of Southern Denmark’s Center for UAS, Centre for Integrative Innovation Management (C*I2M) and UAS Test Center Denmark.We also collaborate with Amfitech, a company that has years of experience with LEGO and whos dedicated team of electronics engineers are focused on developing easy-to-use technology that brings value and fun to a range of end-user applications. Amfitech works within the fields of high performance, cost-efficient tracking, IR and wireless technologies. Help us get MAKKER flyingWe are in the final stages of the development and we need you. All the product details are specified, the technology frame is in place and we are raring to get over the finishing line.We are a dedicated team looking for the extra capital to do further testing and development. We love drones and have identified an untapped corner of a market that builds and grows relationships, both with the drone itself and even more importantly through the drone to other users.With you, we want to be part of that.Hard work and coffee!Our studio is filled with inspiration from the field.Working with rapid prototyping has made it possible to test the concept from a very early stage.We have tested MAKKER on fanatic droneyoungsters .  We have tested the MAKKER concept in a parking garage with cool FPV drone pilots! 

The time-lapse above is from the making of our Indiegogo movie! A beautiful day outdoors and a great team to accomplish the task!

MAKKER has taken many forms during the design and testing process! 
After teaming up with our tech partner we designed the PCB and had a shipment sent over.
Getting the parts home to complete the build of the first MAKKER.
Coding all day - and still coding. Things are looking great! :-)
Who said coding and testing was an easy task? Things work great! We have a good reliable Bluetooth connection, and sunlight doesn't spoil the infrared light signal! 

Risks and challengesWe are quite far in the development of Makker and have already experienced some of the risks and challenges associated with the creation of a new technology product! There are still challenges ahead, but we are doing our very best to tackle them as soon as they appear and we promise you, that we will be open and transparent and keep you well informed through the process!We have teamed up with Amfitech in Denmark on the technology side, and their extensive experience in developing new technology is very important for the success. Among their customers are Lego, and together with them, we have the right people and the know how to see this project through – right till it lands on your doorstep!We have already started preparing the production and we believe it is realistic to deliver MAKKER before Christmas. The MAKKER app is also planned to be available for download before Christmas! We expect to first deliver an android version and soon after the IOS version.",24.0,2,"1 Campaign

It has been designed to provide the action sports community with a place to connect with other riders and share their experience, both the good and bad. Use it to record your rides, save your favorite routes, track your performance metrics - no matter the sport. Your photos, videos, routes and ride stats are all available right from your profile page. Share them to the FUSAR feed, or across your favorite social media channels. You can also talk to your friends at the push of a button thanks to our unlimited-range RiderChat walkie talkie feature. If you find yourself in need of help, you can use our Guardian Angel Emergency Alert feature to send a free SOS message with your GPS location and phone numbers for nearby EMS dispatchers to 3 preset emergency contacts. Did we mention the app is 100% free? Even if you're not in the market for hardware products, this is one tool you can't leave home without.The app is where it all starts, but we take things to the next level with our line of FUSAR Hardwear™ products. Our universal smart helmet system is capable of turning ANY helmet into a smart, connected device - no matter the type, size or shape. There are a just a few components in the kit: the FUSAR Smart Action Camera, the F7 Bluetooth Headset, and our handlebar and wrist-mounted remote controls. Each product functions as a standalone device, but you can unlock some of our best features when you use them together.The complete system provides full action camera, activity tracking, unlimited-range communication*, navigation, music playback, black box, and emergency alert capabilities. Everything the modern rider needs. You can use our handlebar or wrist-mounted remote control everything when you're on the go. No more stopping what you are doing, pulling off you gloves, and fishing your phone out of your pocket. We're not talking about ""inaction sports"" here. Now, you can control your favorite music, talk to your friends, drop waypoints, highlight your favorite twisties, snap and share photos and videos - all without ever taking your hands off the bars or your eyes off of what's ahead.*requires cellular data connection No one likes having to reach up to their helmet to mess with buttons they can't see. Our handlebar and wrist-mounted remote controls allow you to easily interface with your FUSAR Camera. Multi-color LEDs provide constant feedback, so you always know exactly what it's doing.Short press on your handlebar or wrist controller to snap a hi-res photo, or long press to start recording HD video. Photos and video thumbnails instantly sync with your smartphone so you can easily view and share.Have you ever missed an awesome shot because your action camera wasn't recording? We feel your pain. That's why we created the HotShot™ feature. Press two buttons on your handlebar or wrist controller to save the last 15 seconds of action and push it to social media in real-time - even if you weren't actively recording! By the time you stop to check your phone, your friends have already seen it, liked it, and shared it.Our cloud-based push-to-talk communication feature enables up to 12 users to chat walkie-talkie style, over any distance. You can use the FUSAR F7 Bluetooth headset or any 3rd party Bluetooth headset that syncs to iOS and Android devices.The onboard sensors in the FUSAR Camera allow you to track your activity like never before. Ever wanted to know what your air time was? How far you leaned in a turn? How to get back to that awesome set of twisties? Now, all of that data is right at your fingertips.The FUSAR Camera can detect if you've experienced a collision. When a crash has been detected, it immediately sends out an emergency distress beacon. Our cloud servers then automatically send SMS and email alerts to your emergency contacts, or Guardian Angels. They receive a map with your precise location and the local phone numbers of the three nearest EMS dispatchers (over 15,000 locations in North America alone).In the event you go down, our patented black box system locks down the last two minutes of audio, video, speed, direction of travel, and other telemetry information. For the first time ever, you'll have a full, contextual record of what happened leading up to the incident.The FUSAR app packs a lot of punch. It is free to download for iOS and Android devices. Without any additional hardware, it allows you to track your rides, use in-app push-to-talk comms, send GPS emergency beacons, and share photos and videos. FUSAR Camera

Luggage that fits your on-the-go lifestyle and keeps you organized on the road. Available in 2 sizes and 3 colors, this is the upgraded version of our suitcase that keeps selling out.   The shelf hangs on the handle of the suitcase and the front door acts as a kickstand - so you're fully self sufficient no matter how your hotel or Airbnb ends up being.  
 Why is it 2.0? It’s improved from the original that we keep selling out of! We launched the 1.0 last winter and we've sold out of it 5 times. On top of that, TIME Magazine listed us as Best Inventions 2018 in the travel category! 

 
 
Sleek function in your room and stylish looks on the street - available in stealth black and navy blue. The Carry-On fits as standard carry-on for all airlines, including European airlines with limited sizing. The Carry-On Plus is geared for American travelers - U.S. Domestic flights allow this size. Most flights will allow you to take either suitcase + a personal item (i.e. a backpack) *note: we've tested on 20+ flights with the Carry-On Plus size and never been denied.How we've traveled with these:Carry-On: 7x T-Shirts, 7x Socks, 7x Undies, 1 sweater, 1 pair of jeans, Swimsuit.Carry-On Plus: 9x t-shirts, 10x socks, 10x Undies, 2 sweaters, 1 jeans, 1 jacket, Swimsuit.Weight of Carry-On: 7.6lbs + Weight of Carry-On Plus: 7.9lbs. The shelf adds 0.5lbs)
   1) Open the suitcase. 2) Grab shelf system by the top strap and lift up vertically. 3) Hang the shelf from the suitcase trolley handle using the top strap or using the pocket on the back of the shelf. 4) Grab your outfit and go!   This is a major upgrade to the 2.0 - we've made it a great suitcase regardless of the shelf. This means improved internal organization - allows for way better organization in case you're on a trip where you don't use the shelf. *We use the shelf on 3/4 of trips. BYOPB - The internal pocket has space for any powerbank - allowing you to keep charged on the journey. The USB Port has a waterproof flap that covers when not in use.    Anti-Theft is at our core - included is a TSA Approved lock.   Our polycarbonate shell has an anti-scratch surface and offers a little bit of flex for the perfect balance of being durable for long haul (in case you want to check it), and light weight for carrying up the stairs to your Airbnb.  We love travel and we love the planet. Everything we build is designed with sustainability in mind. Starting now - we also remove 5lbs of plastic from the ocean for each item we sell.We owe all of our success to our Kickstarter community and we will forever be thankful for you. You've got first dibs to get discounted products - and the first units to ship. First time backing a Kickstarter? Check over this quick demo to learn how it works. Our team is truly global. We’re based all over the world and we strive every day to be the best that we can be.Adrian Solgaard: Founder and CEO | Chris Cavill: Head of Design | Stan Liu: Head of Operations | Kaveh Kiani: International Sales | Estefania Leon: Controller of Chaos| Libby Vilner: Social Media Coordinator | Taylor King: Photo & Video | Jenina Julian: Customer Service About us:We believe that being a global citizen is about being a good steward to the earth while enjoying everything that it has to offer.

<p>In linea con la tradizione di bruciare ""la vecchia"" di legna per celebrare l'anno nuovo che inizia e la primavera che scaccia l'inverno, abbiamo deciso di costruire un bel falò ogni sei mesi, e per rendere il tutto significativo, facciamo in modo che la gente ci getti dentro i propri ""mostri"". Un ""mostro"" può essere qualcosa con un significato (come un diario oppure un vestito) oppure una tavoletta di legno con sopra scritto qualcosa.

<p>    Hi, we are a small group of people out to “squish” a large problem – The 2 Liter Squish!</p>
<p>   <strong> The Story:</strong></p>
<p>    Once upon a time, there was a very nice man who was invited to his good friend’s pot luck dinner and while holding a plate of food in one hand, attempted to pour himself a cup of soda from a two liter bottle with the other. Said man then embarrassed himself terribly when the dreaded “2 Liter Bottle Squish” was initiated and a geyser was produced - soda went everywhere but in the cup. Basking in the attention, he apologized and cleaned up the mess as he mused that there must be a better way - but after doing some research found out there wasn’t.</p>
<p>     He then remembered the old “wrap the hand evenly around the egg, squeeze the egg and it doesn’t break trick” involving Pascal’s Law combined with the rule of Circumferential Stress stating that an object is weakest when pressure is applied on part of its area and strongest when pressure is evenly distributed over its entire area (okay, whatever)! Born then, was the 2 Liter Handle. Everyone lived happily ever after!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.infozark.net/spill_no_spill_01.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>    <strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<p>    2 Liter Handle’s unique patent pending design simply distributes your grasping force evenly around the bottle for a sure-handed, single-handed, safe, secure, pour every time. The 2 Liter Handle is light weight, dishwasher safe and is easy to use; slip it over the bottle, grab it and pour! And when you set the bottle down, 2 Liter Handle is easy to remove and place on the next bottle - with one hand! So whether you’re carrying a big plate of food at a picnic, or a small toddler at a birthday party, the 2 Liter Handle lets you pour that soda safely without having to put down your precious cargo.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.infozark.net/color_row_bottles_01.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>    <strong>The Plan:</strong></p>
<p>    The design, development, and production of the 2 Liter Handle have been completed and limited inventory has been acquired. We are looking forward to our planned retail launch of the 2 Liter Handle in mid to late February 2013. Your contributions will be used to help fund the marketing cost of the retail launch and the procurement of additional inventory to support the effort.</p>
<p>    We plan to use TV (infomercial) as our main media source to bring the 2 Liter Handle to the attention of the public and are near completion of a one minute commercial to be aired. Once we have established the 2 Liter Handle’s presence in the public eye, we feel certain that the exposure will help us considerably in getting the attention of the larger retail outlets, as well as generate the funds to acquire inventory necessary to approach those large retail outlets. Yes, we intend to head straight to the ""As Seen On TV!"" section of major retailers everywhere! Once we have been established in the retail arena and in the public eye, we anticipate the 2 Liter Handle to establish longevity by becoming a ""household"" item in every home where two liter bottles are used!</p>
<p>    We have been able to introduce the 2 Liter Handle to the retail market on a small scale and it has been received by the consumer with extreme favor.</p>
<p>    You would be hard pressed to walk into a single Mom &amp; Pop store, gas station store, large grocery chain, or any other store selling food items, snacks, etc, and not find two liter bottles of soda offered for sale. Statistically, there are well over 6 billion two liter bottles sold in the United States each year – and pretty much every one of them suffers from the “2 Liter Squish!”</p>
<p>    We do not have statistics on how many two liter geysers are initiated at birthday, New Year’s, Superbowl parties and picnics around the world, but can imagine it is quite a few – we are out to cure that rather inconvenient and embarrassing phenomenon!</p>
<p>    We thank you so much for your support in this endeavor through your contributions!</p>
<p>    Additionally, you can help by telling your friends about the “Solution to the Squishy 2 Liter Bottle”. (Perhaps guarding them against the dreaded ""2 Liter Squish"" initiated geyser and sparing them from a rather embarrassing moment - Hey, what are friends for!)</p>

The world's first city surf


A high tech board with no limits


About the Project: 
""I looked around and could not find the board I dreamed of on the market. So I decided to build it myself. I made DESKA for those who love extreme sports, It's for windsurfers, kiteboarders, snowboarders and more. It's more than a skateboard -it's an experience you have never had before. It's DESKA...""

NOW YOU CAN GET YOUR BOARD and more premium DESKA products 40% CHEAPER THAN THE NORMAL RESALE PRICE! Choose from the PERKS on the right! >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


DESKA Board won the ""People's Choice"" award on LaunchBox's pre-crowdfunding contest. It was a contest sponsored by HP, Intel, and Cut & Paste.

Three-times windsurfing World Champion Ricardo Campello also posted the project on his Facebook page! >



Special features:



Disk brake system       


Windsurf straps             


Windsurf sail input       

Convex carbon kevlar shape
Handmade high-performance design


DISK BRAKE SYSTEM
One of the most helpful features when you use the board in the city. Just stop any time you want! You can use the board with or without the brake system! You can remove it in just two minutes.





Windsurf strap system:
You can set the straps to right-footed or left-footed positions if you're cruising in the city without a sail. Set it on the middle when you use it as a windsurf.  You can also remove it if you want to use the board without straps. Use it however you like!




The strap system makes your jumps easier and safer in the cityIt's also helpful for emergency braking!



USE YOUR SAIL WITH THE BOARD!

The board can be equipped with a windsurf sail. The sail input is similar to windsurf boards. Just attach your sail to the board in 10 seconds!




GREAT FOR WINDSURF SCHOOLS!Teach the basics of windsurfing on land! It's easy to understand the main movements and successions on the ground, and enjoy the power of wind.















Design details

& prototyping:
All parts are hand-made to the highest
              industry standards.

After seeing demand far outweigh supply for Sea of Light, Salas released the second installation in the trilogy, Blue Visions, in 2012. Blue Visions presents readers with captivating images of the varied, and often threatened, marine life that inhabits the Islands of Mexico down to the Equator including Galapagos and Cocos Islands. Blue Visions was released in the iBookstore in the spring of 2014. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/674846/files/20140625122523-Covers.jpg.jpg?1403724323"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>How Was Luminous Sea Shot? </h1><p>For the last seven years, Richard has braved the unpredictable currents of the chilly Northern Pacific ocean to bring us a memorable collection of high-quality seascape photographs. Using an open heart, Salas is able to approach an underwater creature in its natural habitat and capture its personality in a beautiful, candid photograph. </p><p>Richard uses a Nikon 300s with a Tokina 10-17mm for wide angle shots and a 60mm and 105mm for macro with 2 Inon 240 strobes attached to a Subal housing. He dives from charter boats, including Truth Aquatics boats in Santa Barbara: the Nautilus Explorer, the old Don Jose down in Mexico and the Swell in Alaska, along with other divers and leads underwater photography workshops at Gods Pocket out of Port Hardy, British Columbia. </p><br/><h1>What Can I Expect to See in Luminous Sea?</h1><p>Luminous Sea presents the unique marine life found along the coastal islands from Washington to Alaska. Readers will get up-close and personal with wildly playful 700 pound Steller Sea Lions and a 9 foot Giant Pacific Octopus. They’ll see intimate shots of the cutest fish on the planet, Spiny Lumpsuckers and colorful nudibranchs of all sizes and shapes.</p><p>Readers will see these beautiful animals that call the Pacific Northwest home, including:</p><ul>

</ul><p>I took my first trip up to Vancouver Island, Canada in 2004 on the Nautilus Explorer and was stunned at the beauty and prolific life that exists in such cold water. Over the last 10 years, I’ve been up there 9 times and can’t seem to stay away.</p><p>I wanted to show folks that even though the water is a chilly 43 degrees on average, it doesn’t mean there’s no life there. Quite the contrary, the nutrient rich sea has more life per square inch than its warmer counterparts in the tropics. Life explodes all around you diving up there and the effort it takes to dive there is well worth it.</p><p>When I dive up there, I have to put on thermal underwear, then a dry suit to keep the underwear from getting wet.  It’s more cumbersome than just throwing on a wet suit or tee shirt and shorts, but I personally think it’s more interesting up there than in the warmer waters.</p><p>“Luminous Sea” will show the colder side of things -- animals that are beautiful, cute and have lots of personality. You also will not believe the color up there -- greens, golds, yellows and blues.</p><p>Yes, you will come away with a much deeper understanding and appreciation of the great northwest. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/673896/files/20140625043304-01_ASKstudio_fb_ads_470x246px_0011_Blue_Visions_1.jpg?1403695984"" src="""" style=""width: 588.4552845528456px; height: 308px;""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><h1>Dimensions</h1><ul>

We produced our first two books, Sea of Light and Blue Visions, ourselves and, as such, were only able to produce a limited number of books. Being that the donation to The Ocean Foundation is directly affected by the number of copies of Luminous Sea sold, the hope is to produce as many copies of the book as possible.</p><p><b>That’s where you come in.</b></p><p>Helping us reach our funding goal will enable us to offset a portion of the production costs and, in turn, print more copies of Luminous Sea. By helping us with our campaign, you’re helping The Ocean Foundation in their continued aim to preserve the natural marine habitats of the world so that future generations can enjoy them as we have.</p><p><br/></p><h1>Perks</h1><p></p><ul>

That’s why he’s decided to donate 50% of all of Luminous Sea’s profits to the Ocean Foundation.What is the Sea of Light trilogy?Luminous Sea is the third and northernmost installment in the Sea of Light trilogy, a series of three books featuring awe-inspiring photographs of deep-sea habitats along the western coast of North America and Canada.  The first book in the series was Sea of Light (2009), which showcases the underwater habitats of California’s Channel Islands. After seeing demand far outweigh supply for Sea of Light, Salas released the second installation in the trilogy, Blue Visions, in 2012. Blue Visions presents readers with captivating images of the varied, and often threatened, marine life that inhabits the Islands of Mexico down to the Equator including Galapagos and Cocos Islands. Blue Visions was released in the iBookstore in the spring of 2014. How Was Luminous Sea Shot? For the last seven years, Richard has braved the unpredictable currents of the chilly Northern Pacific ocean to bring us a memorable collection of high-quality seascape photographs. Using an open heart, Salas is able to approach an underwater creature in its natural habitat and capture its personality in a beautiful, candid photograph. Richard uses a Nikon 300s with a Tokina 10-17mm for wide angle shots and a 60mm and 105mm for macro with 2 Inon 240 strobes attached to a Subal housing. He dives from charter boats, including Truth Aquatics boats in Santa Barbara: the Nautilus Explorer, the old Don Jose down in Mexico and the Swell in Alaska, along with other divers and leads underwater photography workshops at Gods Pocket out of Port Hardy, British Columbia. What Can I Expect to See in Luminous Sea?Luminous Sea presents the unique marine life found along the coastal islands from Washington to Alaska. Readers will get up-close and personal with wildly playful 700 pound Steller Sea Lions and a 9 foot Giant Pacific Octopus. They’ll see intimate shots of the cutest fish on the planet, Spiny Lumpsuckers and colorful nudibranchs of all sizes and shapes.Readers will see these beautiful animals that call the Pacific Northwest home, including:
Wolf Eels 
Red Irish Lord
Spotted Ratfish
Decorated Warbonnets
Hooded Nudibranchs
Stubby Squid
Sockeye Salmon
Anemones like jewels spread out on the sea bottom

I took my first trip up to Vancouver Island, Canada in 2004 on the Nautilus Explorer and was stunned at the beauty and prolific life that exists in such cold water. Over the last 10 years, I’ve been up there 9 times and can’t seem to stay away.I wanted to show folks that even though the water is a chilly 43 degrees on average, it doesn’t mean there’s no life there. Quite the contrary, the nutrient rich sea has more life per square inch than its warmer counterparts in the tropics. Life explodes all around you diving up there and the effort it takes to dive there is well worth it.When I dive up there, I have to put on thermal underwear, then a dry suit to keep the underwear from getting wet.  It’s more cumbersome than just throwing on a wet suit or tee shirt and shorts, but I personally think it’s more interesting up there than in the warmer waters.“Luminous Sea” will show the colder side of things -- animals that are beautiful, cute and have lots of personality. You also will not believe the color up there -- greens, golds, yellows and blues.Yes, you will come away with a much deeper understanding and appreciation of the great northwest. Dimensions

Why Indiegogo?The decision to host Luminous Sea on Indiegogo ultimately came down to what we hoped to achieve with the book. We produced our first two books, Sea of Light and Blue Visions, ourselves and, as such, were only able to produce a limited number of books. Being that the donation to The Ocean Foundation is directly affected by the number of copies of Luminous Sea sold, the hope is to produce as many copies of the book as possible.That’s where you come in.Helping us reach our funding goal will enable us to offset a portion of the production costs and, in turn, print more copies of Luminous Sea. By helping us with our campaign, you’re helping The Ocean Foundation in their continued aim to preserve the natural marine habitats of the world so that future generations can enjoy them as we have.Perks

<h3>Save Lindsey Wolfe From The Ren Faire Trip Of Doom!</h3>
<p>Lindsey Wolfe and her fiance, Frank, came to the Black Rock Ren Faire in Augusta, MI to be a vendor and make some money. What they ended up with was a dead car, a camper with four flat tires, and a U-Haul mishap that lost them their business computer. Now they're trapped in Michigan with no way to recoup their losses and no idea how they're going to get home.</p>
<h3><strong>This is where you come in:</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Lindsey has been a long-time reader of mine, who has turned into a cherished internet friend. I just want to help her get her vehicles running so she can get back home!</p>
<p>Here is what I'm going to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you donate a hundred bucks ($100.00), I'll name a character after you in one of my Abigail Barnette books. Just, you know, be prepared for that character to be a Victorian harlot or a gay baseball player. You know what I write. I'll use just your first name, if you prefer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you donate fifty bucks ($50.00), you'll be included in a book dedication.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you donate anything under that, I'll put your name on the big old list of awesome people that helped Lindsey, which will go on my blog at the end of the fundraising project.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Author Bronwyn Green will send 4 ebooks from her backlist to everyone who donates $25 or more!</strong></li>
<li><strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other perks will likely be added later, I'm still trying to wrangle some.</strong></p>
<p>Even if we don't reach the goal I set for this thing, all the money that does get raised will go to Lindsey. Every little bit helps!</p>
<p><strong>I just want to help Lindsey and her partner get home! If we make the goal of $1000, I will continue recapping the 50 Shades of Grey books on my blog!</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Plus, everyone who donates at any level will be entered in a drawing to win a necklace from <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/NerdyNecklaces"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Nerdy Necklaces"">http://www.etsy.com/shop/NerdyNecklaces</a></strong><a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/NerdyNecklaces"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Nerdy Necklaces""> </a>!</p>

<p>It's a new kind of crossover bag: a <b>companion bag</b>. We designed it for on-the-go people to be large enough to take on a week-long trip yet maneuverable, durable and light enough for your daily commute.</p>
<h1>2. WHEEL INNOVATION</h1>
<p>All other rolling luggage is basically a box on casters. Their little wheels break more often; they travel badly over bumps, bricks, grates, snow and sand; they weaken the luggage design with more rivets, screws and reinforcements; they require more parts to assemble and break; they reduce the available volume; and they often cause awkward nooks in the interior space.  </p>
<p>But because of our ingenious patented wheel design, G-RO:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>feels lighter:</b> the center of gravity of the load is closer of the center of the wheels;</li>
<li>
<b>rolls easier: </b>the big wheels perform so much better over all terrains, and glide effortlessly on smooth surfaces;</li>
<li>
<b>lasts longer:</b> the case and wheels are integrally designed and reinforce each other; </li>
<li>
<b>packs smarter:</b> there's more interior space than other bags of similar weight and volume;</li>
<li>
<b>looks better: </b>form follows function, and these wheels tell you this is smart design.</li>
</ul>
<h1>3. TOP-NOTCH HANDLING</h1>
<p>Our aircraft-grade aluminum handle is longer and stronger, too. It extends <i>six inches further</i> than the industry standard, with stops at multiple levels for people of all heights. This gives you better leverage than other rollaboards, and makes it extra comfortable to pull your G-RO.</p>
<h1>4. BUILT TOUGH</h1>
<p>We designed G-RO from the strongest and smartest materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ballistic nylon</li>
<li>Aerospace and firearm-grade polymers</li>
<li>Top-quality YKK nylon zippers with a unique (and patented) ""roller coaster"" design that distributes any stress</li>
<li>Waterproof base and arched belly to stay dry and avoid scrapes.</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>5. ROOM FOR WORK <i>AND</i> PLAY</b></h1>
<ul>
<li>A spacious interior compartment for personal items</li>
<li>A compartment for work items — and it can charge your laptop while you travel</li>
<li>A personal pocket for essentials.</li>
</ul>
<h1>6. SUPER POWER</h1>
<p>G-RO has a built-in tablet stand and charging station with two USB ports. And with <b>G-RO Power</b> and <b>G-RO Tracker</b>, your G-RO has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A battery with enough juice (23,000 mAh) to charge your phone, tablet and laptop all at once—that's enough power to charge your smartphone up to 10X</li>
<li>A universal DC output to charge your laptop</li>
<li>A location tracker</li>
<li>A wireless proximity detector.</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>REINVENTING THE WHEEL</b></h1>
<p>Most luggage is literally a drag. Back in 1596, the term “luggage” was coined from the word “lug” which means “to drag.” Surprisingly, over 400 years later, most of us are still lugging around our bags. Rollaboards were developed in the 1980's, but their small wheels, while an improvement, still haven’t done much to make a bag feel lighter.</p>
<p>Take a look at our wheels and we think you'll see why they work so much better:</p>
<div>
<div data-id=""4576042""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480935542/gwrk6ha3gakxdnatrnnv.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">G-RO's wheels make the bag to feel lighter while also being more spacious and more durable.</p>
<div data-id=""4576045""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1449873174/r5b0e6qunbpnuajpksaf.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Because of their <b><i>large diameter</i></b>, the wheels support the load closer to its center of gravity, so your bag balances better and <b><i>feels significantly lighter</i></b> when you pull it. </p>
<div data-id=""4576049""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1449873174/ffmak16u37hlqxvc6qpa.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>G-RO<b><i> glides easily </i></b>over any kind of terrain—cobblestones, curbs, steps, gravel, snow, sand.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Because our wheels are on the outside of the bag, our bag offers a <b><i>larger packable space</i></b> compared to typical rolling bags.</p>

<p>Our wheels are made of super strong aerospace and firearm-grade polymers that<b> <i>strengthen the walls</i></b> of the bag. Unlike traditional bags, the wheels are the strength of this bag—not the weakness.</p>

<h1>LONG, STRONG, ERGONOMIC HANDLE</h1>
<p>G-RO's aircraft grade aluminum four-stage telescoping handle is more than <i>six inches longer</i> than the industry standard! The handle stops at multiple levels and is great for people of all heights. It provides better leverage and comfort.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p></figure></div>
<h1>SUPER STRONG MATERIALS</h1>
<p>The body of G-RO is made of high quality Cordura ballistic nylon and mold-injected aerospace-grade polymers. It’s crush proof and water resistant, keeping your belongings safe and sound.</p>
<p>The zippers are high quality YKK zippers.  G-RO’s unique “roller coaster” zipper design helps distribute any stress across the zipper, creating a longer zipper life.</p>

<p>To protect your items from water damage, G-RO's bottom protective panel consists of a plastic shell over a waterproof, plastic-coated ballistic nylon textile to ensure that nothing gets wet. </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>WORK PLAY COMPARTMENTS FOR WORK LIFE BALANCE</h1>
<p>G-RO has an internal compartment for your personal items and an external compartment for your work items, because no one likes to show their “unmentionables” at a business meeting (or at least most people).</p>
<p>G-RO helps your private items stay private, but gives you immediate easy access to the items you need while traveling or working. </p>

<p>The latest “game-changing” luggage configuration - the four-wheel “spinner“ luggage with 360 degree turning capabilities, was introduced globally by Samsonite in 1990, more than 25 years ago, but the problem with four-wheel luggage is that it doesn’t really work anywhere except on a perfectly flat surface.</p>
<p>More than half of the time people carry their four-wheeled bags in a tilted position, because it’s far more comfortable. If you’re moving over a rough surface, it’s impossible to pull a four-wheeled bag. You’re basically just dragging the weight. Ergonomically, it’s better for you to have the bag pulled slightly behind you than directly at your side. In tight spaces, it’s nearly impossible to roll a bag by your side, so four-wheel users tilt the bag and pull it behind themselves to cut through a crowd. Lastly, if the bag is heavy, maneuvering it can become tiring on the wrist, and with today’s mega terminals, it can be hard to push them for long distances.</p>
<p>Besides the impracticality of using a four-wheel bag in many scenarios, the four-wheel bags have wheels that protrude and therefore are more likely to catch and break. It’s particularly inconvenient when it’s the ones you need for walking with the bag tilted. Lastly, despite these negatives, one still must pay a 20-30% premium price for these four-wheeled models.</p>

 Classic Black G-RO with Silver Wheels
 
 

Stealth Black G-RO with red wheels in the overhead bin.
 

  
G-RO is the world's first bag in a whole new category: it's a companion bag—a bag specifically designed to accompany on-the-go people, whether they are traveling around the block or around the globe. We all know travel can be a hassle. The more you do it, the more tiring and frustrating it becomes. To get from here to there, too many of us depend on inferior bags, travel gear and accessories. 
So, we set out to design a bag that is better than anything else available. Here are six reasons we think G-RO really is different, and better, than any other bag: 
 

 
1. G-RO IS YOUR COMPANION BAG
It's a new kind of crossover bag: a companion bag. We designed it for on-the-go people to be large enough to take on a week-long trip yet maneuverable, durable and light enough for your daily commute.
2. WHEEL INNOVATION
All other rolling luggage is basically a box on casters. Their little wheels break more often; they travel badly over bumps, bricks, grates, snow and sand; they weaken the luggage design with more rivets, screws and reinforcements; they require more parts to assemble and break; they reduce the available volume; and they often cause awkward nooks in the interior space.  
But because of our ingenious patented wheel design, G-RO:  


feels lighter: the center of gravity of the load is closer of the center of the wheels;

rolls easier: the big wheels perform so much better over all terrains, and glide effortlessly on smooth surfaces;

lasts longer: the case and wheels are integrally designed and reinforce each other; 

packs smarter: there's more interior space than other bags of similar weight and volume;

looks better: form follows function, and these wheels tell you this is smart design.

3. TOP-NOTCH HANDLING
Our aircraft-grade aluminum handle is longer and stronger, too. It extends six inches further than the industry standard, with stops at multiple levels for people of all heights. This gives you better leverage than other rollaboards, and makes it extra comfortable to pull your G-RO.
4. BUILT TOUGH
We designed G-RO from the strongest and smartest materials:

Ballistic nylon
Aerospace and firearm-grade polymers
Top-quality YKK nylon zippers with a unique (and patented) ""roller coaster"" design that distributes any stress
Waterproof base and arched belly to stay dry and avoid scrapes.

5. ROOM FOR WORK AND PLAY

A spacious interior compartment for personal items
A compartment for work items — and it can charge your laptop while you travel
A personal pocket for essentials.

6. SUPER POWER
G-RO has a built-in tablet stand and charging station with two USB ports. And with G-RO Power and G-RO Tracker, your G-RO has:

A battery with enough juice (23,000 mAh) to charge your phone, tablet and laptop all at once—that's enough power to charge your smartphone up to 10X
A universal DC output to charge your laptop
A location tracker
A wireless proximity detector.


 

REINVENTING THE WHEEL
Most luggage is literally a drag. Back in 1596, the term “luggage” was coined from the word “lug” which means “to drag.” Surprisingly, over 400 years later, most of us are still lugging around our bags. Rollaboards were developed in the 1980's, but their small wheels, while an improvement, still haven’t done much to make a bag feel lighter.
Take a look at our wheels and we think you'll see why they work so much better:


G-RO's wheels make the bag to feel lighter while also being more spacious and more durable.

 
Because of their large diameter, the wheels support the load closer to its center of gravity, so your bag balances better and feels significantly lighter when you pull it. 

 
G-RO glides easily over any kind of terrain—cobblestones, curbs, steps, gravel, snow, sand.

 
Because our wheels are on the outside of the bag, our bag offers a larger packable space compared to typical rolling bags.

Our wheels are made of super strong aerospace and firearm-grade polymers that strengthen the walls of the bag. Unlike traditional bags, the wheels are the strength of this bag—not the weakness.

 
LONG, STRONG, ERGONOMIC HANDLE
G-RO's aircraft grade aluminum four-stage telescoping handle is more than six inches longer than the industry standard! The handle stops at multiple levels and is great for people of all heights. It provides better leverage and comfort.

 
SUPER STRONG MATERIALS
The body of G-RO is made of high quality Cordura ballistic nylon and mold-injected aerospace-grade polymers. It’s crush proof and water resistant, keeping your belongings safe and sound.
The zippers are high quality YKK zippers.  G-RO’s unique “roller coaster” zipper design helps distribute any stress across the zipper, creating a longer zipper life.


  

ARCHED BELLY DESIGN AND WATERPROOF BASE
G-RO’s arched belly design ensures the bag doesn’t scrape on the ground. 

To protect your items from water damage, G-RO's bottom protective panel consists of a plastic shell over a waterproof, plastic-coated ballistic nylon textile to ensure that nothing gets wet. 
 
WORK PLAY COMPARTMENTS FOR WORK LIFE BALANCE
G-RO has an internal compartment for your personal items and an external compartment for your work items, because no one likes to show their “unmentionables” at a business meeting (or at least most people).
G-RO helps your private items stay private, but gives you immediate easy access to the items you need while traveling or working. 
 
SPACIOUS INTERIOR COMPARTMENT FOR PERSONAL ITEMS
G-RO’s spacious and private interior compartment is designed for easier packing. It includes: 

A detachable flat packing divider for items you want to keep separate or wrinkle-free, 
Plenty of mesh pockets for packing options, 
A removable garment bag for your dress clothes, 
A TSA-friendly lock for added security




G-RO comes with a removable garment bag, shown above
 
""NO FISHING"" COMPARTMENT FOR WORK ITEMS
Ever feel like you’re blindly fishing for items in your bag? G-RO solves that problem with its organized, easy-access external compartment. It includes:

padded pockets for your 15” laptop
plenty of other places for your tablet, papers, pens, etc. 

 

 

With G-RO's G-RO Power and G-RO Tracker (formerly known as the Optional Electronic Module), you can charge your laptop while it's in the laptop pocket. See the ""G-RO Power and G-RO Tracker"" section for more details.
 
PERSONAL POCKET FOR ESSENTIALS AND WATER BOTTLE HOLDER
Tucked in the area of G-RO's handle, this easy access pocket holds your passport or any other essential items you want to keep safe and close to you. It also has a convenient water bottle holder.

 
BUILT-IN CHARGING STATION AND TABLET STAND
A Built-In Charging Station is built into the top of each G-RO. This water-resistant charging station includes 2 iPad-strength USB outlets.
NOTE: To charge your devices from the Built-In Charging Station, you must first purchase and connect G-RO Power or your own portable charger to the charging cables located in G-RO’s interior compartment. See the ""G-RO Power and G-RO Tracker"" section below for details.

Built-In Charging Station. *Cable not included.
 
When open, G-RO's handle functions as a tablet stand! 

Built-In Tablet Stand
 
G-RO POWER & G-RO TRACKER
G-RO Power and G-RO Tracker (formerly known as the Optional Electronic Module) is a $175 value.
G-RO Power includes:

A 23,000 mAh battery
2 USB ports (that connect to built-in wires, which power the Built-In Charging Station on the top of the bag)
1 universal DC output
The charging adapters and cables you need for common laptops
And G-RO Tracker includes:


A location tracker 
A proximity detector
Integration with G-RO App


 

G-RO Power connects to 2 USB cords located in the external work compartment. These cords run through the interior of the bag and connect to and power the Built-In Charging Station at the top of the bag.
 
Because we’re confident in G-RO’s durability and we think it will stay with you for years, we chose not to build G-RO Power or G-RO Tracker into the bag. We realize that electronics often need an upgrade or need to be replaced. We also wanted to give you the option of using both components outside of G-RO! 

With G-RO Power, you can charge your laptop, tablet and smartphone all at once.
 
G-RO POWER: PORTABLE BATTERY
The Optional Electronic Module's G-RO Power has a 23,000 mAh battery, which is strong enough to charge your smartphone up to 10 times! 

 
 
G-RO TRACKER: LOCATION TRACKER AND PROXIMITY DETECTOR
G-RO Tracker uses GSM-GPRS technology for location tracking and Bluetooth Smart/Bluetooth Low Energy technology for proximity detection. Using G-RO's mobile app, you can track the global location and proximity of your G-RO. Our app is compatible with iOS and Android smart phones that support BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). 
You’ll never lose your G-RO or have to join the crowd at the baggage carousel unnecessarily. You'll be alerted if the bag gets too far away from you. 
For those of you that want to track your bag beyond your immediate vicinity, you can sign up for sign up for the following affordable tracking subscriptions through our G-RO mobile app: (1) Month $4.99, (6) Months $19.99, or (12) Months $29.99. 
You will have unlimited, free proximity alerts with G-RO Tracker.


 



The exact specifications are subject to minor changes as we optimize the design for mass production. The weight and capacity are based on computer generated analysis. 

The G-RO carry-on now comes in two different colors. 
 

After 11 days of placing your order, you will receive a survey via email where you can select your color. 
 


We offer $15 SHIPPING to the United States. For the rest of the world, please check your shipping rate on the check-out menu while backing the project.

GUARANTEED FOR LIFE ...   
We designed and build G-RO to last a lifetime and we stand behind the quality and durability of our products. If your bag ever breaks down, just ship it back to us. We'll either repair it or replace it, and return it to you. It's our lifetime guarantee to you.
...BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL.

The latest “game-changing” luggage configuration - the four-wheel “spinner“ luggage with 360 degree turning capabilities, was introduced globally by Samsonite in 1990, more than 25 years ago, but the problem with four-wheel luggage is that it doesn’t really work anywhere except on a perfectly flat surface.
More than half of the time people carry their four-wheeled bags in a tilted position, because it’s far more comfortable. If you’re moving over a rough surface, it’s impossible to pull a four-wheeled bag. You’re basically just dragging the weight. Ergonomically, it’s better for you to have the bag pulled slightly behind you than directly at your side. In tight spaces, it’s nearly impossible to roll a bag by your side, so four-wheel users tilt the bag and pull it behind themselves to cut through a crowd. Lastly, if the bag is heavy, maneuvering it can become tiring on the wrist, and with today’s mega terminals, it can be hard to push them for long distances.
Besides the impracticality of using a four-wheel bag in many scenarios, the four-wheel bags have wheels that protrude and therefore are more likely to catch and break. It’s particularly inconvenient when it’s the ones you need for walking with the bag tilted. Lastly, despite these negatives, one still must pay a 20-30% premium price for these four-wheeled models.",44.0,1,"3 Campaigns

Camping, travel, unique adventures, family, and serving others are some of our favorites so VanGo makes sense. WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT –Jordan’s dream has been to own an auto repair shop that goes over and beyond for customers, staff, and the community. One way we will achieve and deliver this dream is through renting VW Vanagon Campervans. Last fall, we packed up our family to road trip 5,500 miles and visit six Vanagon rental shops throughout the country. These companies reported that they cannot keep up with demand. Customers simply loved their old school retro road trip adventure. There are no VW Vanagon rental companies in the Midwest and VanGo does not want the Midwest to miss out on these classic rides any longer. WHAT WE NEED SUPPORT FOR –We need your support to help us get a fleet of four VW Vanagons on the Midwest roads. Currently, we have enough funds to complete our two current Vanagons; however, we need your help to update the next two vans (i.e. new bumpers, new fridge, awnings, replacing worn out parts, ensuring they are in tip top shape mechanically, etc.) purchased in March-April. Please help us gift the Midwest people with the opportunity to experience what the VW Vanagon Campervan hype is all about; after all, the rest of the nation is geeking out about it because it’s so cool. The chart below allows one to understand the benefits of the VanGo rentals. HOW MUCH SUPPORT WE NEED –To fund VanGo, we have put our life’s savings into this exciting venture, have two banks working with us, a nonprofit, Department of Economic Employment and Development, and personal loans from friends/family. The $12,500 we are campaigning for here will enable us put those last two classics reliably on the road and looking good. This dream and gift to the Midwest would not be possible without a community of supporters. Whoa – thank you for being a part of that community! PERKS FOR SUPPORTING VANGONo, not this cute baby Ivy but one of the perks is a vacation in the Vanagon behind us! RISKS & CHALLENGESOne of the largest obstacles is securing four quality Vanagons and preparing these classics to be rental ready.

The concept was to design a bag for those who don’t want their gear to hold their travel experience back. We travel a lot so our target group was initially ourselves although later we worked with friends, family and other people who spend lots of time on the move to understand what are the big travel annoyances which we can address. Following our research, we moved quickly from sketches to prototyping, trialling, testing and improving until now where we have refined the design and developed a production ready sample.ProductionWe have searched far and wide for a manufacturer who can construct our products to the highest standard under fair working conditions. We spent many weeks working with our chosen manufacturing partner and we’re delighted with both the quality of workmanship and their demonstration of ethical business practice.DistributionWe've tried to be as proactive as possible to ensure that we distribute the goods as quickly as possible. We've paired up with an extremely competent distribution company with warehouses across the world. We know that they're the best for the job!ArcidoArcido was set up to make one-bag travel easier and smarter. We’re based in Edinburgh, UK but spend as much time travelling as we can. Travelling with a bag on your back leaves you feeling more free do what you what you want so it’s definitely the way that we prefer to travel. We couldn’t find a bag that fulfilled our functional criteria so we’ve built a brand to make the best, beautiful carry-on bags.Your SupportIt’s already taken more than 6 months of hard work to get The Arcido Bag into what we think is the perfect carry-on bag. Now we’re looking for backers to help us fund our initial production run. Reaching our goal will mean we’ve got enough funds to cover our manufacturer’s minimum order requirement. Having received great feedback from product testers and reviewers, we’re confident The Arcido Bag is going to be a success. And we’re looking forward to making more travel bags in the future!We want as many people to know about our project as possible so we would be really grateful if you were to share our campaign on Facebook and Twitter. We really appreciate your support!                                  
PressInterested in writing about our project? You can find a press release and  images here. Need something else? Fancy a chat? Just email us at press@arcido.comRisks and challengesBetween us we’ve worked for a number of companies producing soft products handling all aspects of bringing new bags to market so this definitely isn’t our ‘first rodeo’!We’ve also meticulously planned the campaign which should mean that the production and fulfilment process runs smoothly. That said, some eventualities are uncontrollable but we’ll do everything we can to prevent delays. We also promise to keep our supporters updated with progress.What is Kickstarter?Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that allows creators to fund projects. It's a way of guaranteeing us customers when we launch our product - your pledge goes into a total pot which we put towards the cost of producing and distributing our product. Once we have enough pledges, we'll have enough funds to go into production.You aren't charged until our funding period ends. However Kickstarter will place a temporary block on your card for the amount you pledge.If you pledge, it'll take a few months to receive your bag. That's because our manufacturing time is 40 days, and it takes around 30 days to ship the product to Europe/USA by sea. However, by backing our project now you'll get a much better deal on the bag - all our pledge tiers are lower than the RRP. You're also helping to support an early stage startup, and for that we're really grateful!",53.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We work to provide design and innovation to the urban cycling community. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Carlos, Co founder, realized thanks to his wife, the common helmets were not adapted to the way urban cyclist live and understand the cities.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>Closca redefines the cyclist helmet, wisely adapting it to the city, focusing on two important handicaps conventional helmets have: </p>
<p>- Excessive volume, which makes carrying it difficult after pedaling.</p>
<p>- A look that is cut off from the personal style of those who choose bicycle as their transportation alternative and do not want to compromise their style.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>To develop this smart and elegant product, Closca teamed up with 2 great partners:</p>
<ul><li>
<a href=""http://www.upv.es/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Polytechnic University of Valencia</a>, one of best technologic centres according the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU). And <a href=""biomechanics%20institute%20of%20valencia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Biomechanics Institute of Valencia</a>. Engineering and lot of talent to resolve the impact absorption, anthropometric   and comfort design.  </li></ul>

The Story

""Reason loves emotion""


We work to provide design and innovation to the urban cycling community.  
Carlos, Co founder, realized thanks to his wife, the common helmets were not adapted to the way urban cyclist live and understand the cities.

Closca redefines the cyclist helmet, wisely adapting it to the city, focusing on two important handicaps conventional helmets have: 
- Excessive volume, which makes carrying it difficult after pedaling.
- A look that is cut off from the personal style of those who choose bicycle as their transportation alternative and do not want to compromise their style.


To develop this smart and elegant product, Closca teamed up with 2 great partners:

The Polytechnic University of Valencia, one of best technologic centres according the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU). And Biomechanics Institute of Valencia. Engineering and lot of talent to resolve the impact absorption, anthropometric   and comfort design.  

Culdesac, creative partner for product deconstructing and helping to get a very sexy product.









Bike to work

""We believe in better cities""






We believe in bicycles, not only as the best mean of transportation for cities but also the most beautiful. Our aim is to encourage as many people as possible to adopt a stylish two wheeled approach.

Our contribution:

Get Partnership with global brands like Airbus or Telefónica; promoting #biketowork among their employees.



Our new App - RideU - for smartphones that is capable of browsing over 240 municipal bicycle rental services in more than 25 countries. With RideU it is possible to check bicycle availability, find empty bicycle bays and know the general status of the service. Furthermore, this new app is compatible with the new Apple Watch and with Google Glass.

[Goal 3- $80k : Closca new App with NFC Integration] 


We Love Technology - Our helmet is the first with integrated NFC chip for bidirectional communication between helmet & smartphone.  Would you like if your helmet could give the instruction to call your emergency number only by approaching your smartphone? Can you imagine taking your public bike using your Closca helmet instead of your citibike card?  






Yes! This is possible today and Closca Design is working on it. 
Is there something else you would like us to include in the New App? Let us know  your suggestions :)


Sustainability: Awarded Eco Value proposalAs consecuence, we have been winners of the Accelerator Climate Kic-European Program, the EU’s main climate innovation initiative, promoting smart cities and CO2 reduction.



Design Process

""Our challenge: Urban Helmet Deconstruction""




Treating cycling as an icon itself, has inspired us to create an honest set, where form and function coexist in a balance, generating the personality of the product. So the helmet is explained intuitively by itself. 
Dieter Rams guidelines inspires today the Product Design in companies like Braun or Apple. These guidelines have influenced very positively in our Design Process, Closca Fuga is innovative, understandable, clean and timeless.

Design and innovation coexist in this useful helmet: the first safety certified and most efficient folding system.

I was impressed with the nationalism of the American people and I tried, for the last 3 years of my life to inspire patriotism to my fellow countrymen. I am carrying my national flag everywhere with me, teaching people something about my country, teaching them words and inviting them to explore Romania and inviting them to come visit Dracula's castle and many other interesting places in my country. I even customized a pair of chucks with my country's flag colors. I am happy to see how the people of the United States have their national flag on clothes, shoes, cars and any product you can think at... and how they proudly carry it everywhere, especially in their soul. I tried the same with my country, I customized t-shirts and I tried to copy my model. I do not know if I succeeded but I am truly grateful to be inspired in the first place. And for this, I would like to invite you to participate to my campaign... People in the United States are a community and you guys help each other. I will give you an example - If somebody looks suspicious staying too long next to somebody's car, there will be a person that will call the police. If somebody does something wrong on the street, people will defend the one that did not do anything wrong. Even for a cat that hides under a bench, people will stop and try to help the owner. All these happened to me, one in Texas, Dallas, another in Ocean City, Maryland.

Whether it's to the office, from the gym to the bar, or on the trail, this is the last carry system you'll ever need.Swap between packs to save time. No more frantic unpacking and repacking.  Meet the frame to end all pack frames By designing the Quiver around a removable frame, the packs are easy to repair and refurbish. This keeps our backpacks out of the landfill and on the trail.Every adventure needs a unique pack. OddLot is excited to continue designing new packs that all fit the Thruster Frame, which saves you time, money, and space in your closet. Your Quiver can grow to fit your unique, adventurous lifestyle.Meet the Packs  The Sidestep is a daypack designed for the modern hiker. It features zipper-free stretchy side pockets that are great for stowing snacks or a phone . With a water bladder sleeve and trekking pole / ice axe loops, the Sidestep is the ultimate day hiking backpack. The Bandit is ideal for the daily grind, whether commuting by bike or train to the office or gym. The clamshell design makes it easy to organize everything you need for the day. It features a padded laptop sleeve that fits 15"" laptops and doesn't interfere with the support of the frame. Interior organizer pockets keep cables and pens tight and easy to access. You don't take a laptop into the woods, nor trekking poles into the office. The Quiver allows you to be purposeful in what you take with you.Product Features The Quiver is the best backpack system because it eliminates redundancy. No more compromising on features. The technical backpack frame supports your load no matter the adventure. YKK #8 waterproof zippers are easy to pull, durable, and keep out water. Our zipper pulls are also fully glove compatible.   Swaps in 15 seconds or less!  Unlike complicated modular systems, the Quiver swaps quick and easy without any hassle.We are excited to offer The Quiver in new color options. If we meet these stretch goals, you have the option of choosing what colorway you want before fullfilment. We are still matching fabrics, so the colors could be slightly different than what is drafted above.FUTURE QUIVER PACKS The Quiver doesn't stop with the Bandit and Sidestep. Currently, a drybag pack is in development. We can't wait to share the progress with everyone. Every pack we make will fit the same Thruster frame. This saves our existing customers money in the long run because there is no need to buy a frame over and over. By designing the Quiver around a single frame, the amount of waste and material redundancy is reduced in the manufacturing processes, lessening our impact on the environment.  SIZING AND FIT We want these packs to fit everyone. The standard frame (pictured) fits most, while the XL frame will fit the taller humans. We recommend the XL frame for 5'11"" and up.Meet the Team The Odd Lot team was formed by three outdoorsy gearheads who were convinced that there had to be a better, more efficient approach to the entire backpack industry. As both outdoor adventurers and urban travelers, the team knew that the current paradigm of buying one-off, unique, disparate and costly packs for each specific adventure was inefficient, frustrating and expensive. From the outset, their mission was to design long-lasting, efficient, affordable serious gear for un-serious people. Their groundbreaking backpack system, The Quiver, has been in the works for over two years.SustainabilityWe recognize that making any product using modern technical materials is inherently bad for the planet.The most effective way to combat the impact a product has on the environment is by increasing that product’s useful lifespan.That’s why we make our packs both durable and easier to repair. Our goal in the years to come is to implement a repair and refurbish program that will keep packs on your back, full of memories, and ready to pass on to the next adventurer.The OddLot GuaranteeIt is important for a brand to stand behind it's products. We have built our packs tough, durable, and timeless. In the unlikely event that a product does fail, we will right the situation.Production TimelineWe've partnered with one of the best backpack manufacturers in the world. Their expertise and dedication to quality has helped Odd Lot bring this crazy idea to life.

<li>
<strong>It's Faster:</strong> No more gate checking. No more searching for a big enough overhead bin spot. With one bag, you move faster and wait around less. </li>
<li>
<strong>It's Safer:</strong> Carrying multiple bags, particularly ones with wheels, marks you as a tourist, making you a target for thieves. When you travel with one bag, you blend in more and keep your stuff with you. </li>
<li>
<strong>It's Easier:</strong> When you're not dragging a bag behind you, your hands are free and it's easier to move through a crowded airport or public transport.</li>
<li>
<strong>It's Less Expensive:</strong> Avoid baggage fees when you check and keep your bag with you when you explore. </li>
<li>
<strong>It's More Fun:</strong> Ever have a few extra hours on a trip that you ended up wasting? If you have wheeled luggage, you're stuck going only where it can go. With the Continuum, you can explore and take your stuff with you. </li>

<p>We found that a lot of the bags that people use for one bag travel weren't particularly friendly to laptops. Some add a padded laptop compartment, but even with a dedicated compartment you still need a way to carry your laptop during the day when you're not hauling everything else.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we built a matching laptop sleeve that actually becomes its own bag.</p>

<strong>Two Sizes:</strong> If your reward includes a sleeve, you'll get to choose a 13"" or 15"" size when you complete your backer survey. As far as sizing goes, the 13"" easily fits both MacBooks and MacBook Airs. The 15"" sleeve accommodates most 15.6"" laptops. The largest laptop we tested was <a href=""http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/latit/dell_latitude_e6530_spec_sheet.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this Dell</a>, which is 15.1"" x 10.1"" x ~1.2"". </li>

<strong>In-Sleeve Charging:</strong> Our double-zippered ingress opens wide enough that you can charge while your laptop is safe in its case. </li>

<strong>TSA Compliant:</strong> We comply with TSA specs so you don't have to remove your laptop from the sleeve to x-ray it.</li>

<p>Many of the world's best and most interesting destinations require buses or subways to see. </p>
<p>When you're on public transport, the last thing you want is a big bag knocking into people or rolling over their toes. We've designed the Continuum to go strapless to minimize your footprint in a crowd.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>If you want to carry just one bag, there a couple of key considerations:</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> You want enough capacity to fit your stuff but not so much that you end up with too much weight, especially with people with smaller frames. After trying both larger and smaller options, we felt that 30 liters offered the best balance for the most trips for the most people. </p>
<p><strong>Shape:</strong> Most soft bags - both backpacks and duffels - are...roundish. This presents a problem because your stuff stays nicer when it's packed flat. We opted for the classic lines of an old Volvo - <strong>boxy but good</strong> - to maximize usable space while minimizing wrinkles. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467385276/whavbbhpiyzvzpsvgulm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The boxy shape pays dividends when you have to store it as well. With a little practice, you'll be amazed at how much you can take with you in something that takes up so little space.</p>

<p>The shell is made of an innovative PVC Coated 300D Ballistic Nylon. Most premium bags go with a heavier weight, but uncoated nylon. By adding the PVC coating we're able to offer awesome protection (including fray resistance) with a lighter weight fabric. In terms of look and feel, the finer denier (basically thinner fibers) impart a softer hand-feel than you get from heavier denier bags.</p>

<p>To get through security as quickly as possible, it helps to have a place you can easily stuff your phone, passport, watch and wallet. </p>
<p>We created a special fleece-lined pocket for stashing your valuables as your bag gets x-rayed. Every time we use this little pocket, we're thankful we're not digging around for our stuff in the main compartment or leaving it in the bin.</p>

<p>Several successful bags on crowdfunding sites have featured some sort of built in charging apparatus. We respect the ambition here, but the problem with this is that the second you add electronics to soft goods, you dramatically increase the regulatory cost of production to get various international certifications (read: you get long delivery times).</p>
<p>We liked the idea of integrated charging, but we suspected that most of our prospective backers already had one or more USB chargers lying around. So we just made a pocket that will support most 3rd party chargers to charge less for the bag and get it to you more quickly. </p>

<p>Shoes are the bane of any efficient packer's existence, especially if you want to work out while you're on a trip that requires more than a pair of trainers. The Continuum features two large shoe pockets - one on each end - so you can keep your footwear, workout gear or dirty laundry separated from the rest of your stuff.  Pockets are big enough for dress boots as shown below.</p>

</div>
</div></div>","Pledge now to lock in our best pricing and to discover how to make travel better and more fun by becoming a one bag traveler. Mr. Davis has completed two successful crowdfunding campaigns (one for our best undershirt and the other for our best underwear) in the past and we are excited to bring our latest project to Indiegogo.We know how important it is to deliver quickly, so that's exactly what we're going to do here. We have hundreds of great great rewards for early supporters. Maybe you've never heard of one bag travel. It's still a quiet but burgeoning movement of people around the world who have discovered that a minimalist approach to both business and personal travel has a lot of advantages over the way most of us travel.

It's Faster: No more gate checking. No more searching for a big enough overhead bin spot. With one bag, you move faster and wait around less. 

It's Safer: Carrying multiple bags, particularly ones with wheels, marks you as a tourist, making you a target for thieves. When you travel with one bag, you blend in more and keep your stuff with you. 

It's Easier: When you're not dragging a bag behind you, your hands are free and it's easier to move through a crowded airport or public transport.

It's Less Expensive: Avoid baggage fees when you check and keep your bag with you when you explore. 

It's More Fun: Ever have a few extra hours on a trip that you ended up wasting? If you have wheeled luggage, you're stuck going only where it can go. With the Continuum, you can explore and take your stuff with you. 
Travel experts like Rick Steves and Conde Nast (among many many others) believe that one bag traveling is the best way to go.These sites endorse the flexibility of one bag or carry-on only travel (links above).Once you try one bag traveling - whether with the Continuum or another option - you'll never want to haul multiple bags again. The Continuum can easily handle a three to four night trip. If you're an efficient packer, you can get five to seven nights from a bag that will fit in any overhead bin, even on international and commuter flights. 

 
Frames and wheels have their place, but for most of your trips, they add weight, complexity and cost. They also take up space that could otherwise be used for your stuff. By going with a soft shell, we maximize capacity and minimize weight.

 

 

We found that a lot of the bags that people use for one bag travel weren't particularly friendly to laptops. Some add a padded laptop compartment, but even with a dedicated compartment you still need a way to carry your laptop during the day when you're not hauling everything else.
To address this issue, we built a matching laptop sleeve that actually becomes its own bag.

 



Two Sizes: If your reward includes a sleeve, you'll get to choose a 13"" or 15"" size when you complete your backer survey. As far as sizing goes, the 13"" easily fits both MacBooks and MacBook Airs. The 15"" sleeve accommodates most 15.6"" laptops. The largest laptop we tested was this Dell, which is 15.1"" x 10.1"" x ~1.2"". 

In-Sleeve Charging: Our double-zippered ingress opens wide enough that you can charge while your laptop is safe in its case. 

TSA Compliant: We comply with TSA specs so you don't have to remove your laptop from the sleeve to x-ray it.

Becomes a Bag: Our included d-rings attach to the bag's strap so you have a perfect small bag while you're on the road.



13"" sleeve with a little extra room for your stuff.
 
 
 

 
The best way to make travel more fun is to make it easier. To that end we built the Continuum so you could carry it how you like depending on what you are doing. We offer two main carry options plus a third bonus option for getting around in tight spaces. 
 
 

 
Seasoned travelers swear by the backpack. They minimize your silhouette and distribute weight efficiently, so they're fantastic over distance. If your trip is going to require a decent amount of walking, we recommend wearing the Continuum as a backpack. 
 

 

 

 
Whether you just want something to help you to get out and see a new city at the end of a business trip or you're looking to buy a Eurail pass and hang out in Europe for a few months, we have you covered.
 

 
The backpack straps are reinforced, are lightly padded with a breathable mesh and feature an elastic chest stabilizer to help keep the Continuum close to your body.
 

 
When you're not using the bag as a backpack, the straps tuck away into a recessed zipper pocket so they won't tangle.
 
 

 
For shorter trips, you might prefer to wear the Continuum as a shoulder bag - messenger style if you will. Doing so makes the TSA pocket more accessible to help you speed through security and makes your laptop easier to grab.
 

 

 
If you're not going to spend that much time actually carrying your bag, we highly recommend traveling messenger style.  
 

 

Many of the world's best and most interesting destinations require buses or subways to see. 
When you're on public transport, the last thing you want is a big bag knocking into people or rolling over their toes. We've designed the Continuum to go strapless to minimize your footprint in a crowd.

 

 
If you want to carry just one bag, there a couple of key considerations:
Size: You want enough capacity to fit your stuff but not so much that you end up with too much weight, especially with people with smaller frames. After trying both larger and smaller options, we felt that 30 liters offered the best balance for the most trips for the most people. 
Shape: Most soft bags - both backpacks and duffels - are...roundish. This presents a problem because your stuff stays nicer when it's packed flat. We opted for the classic lines of an old Volvo - boxy but good - to maximize usable space while minimizing wrinkles. 
 

The boxy shape pays dividends when you have to store it as well. With a little practice, you'll be amazed at how much you can take with you in something that takes up so little space.
 

 
For a detailed list of all features, see our feature image at the top of the page. Below, we've highlighted some of our favorites. 
 

The shell is made of an innovative PVC Coated 300D Ballistic Nylon. Most premium bags go with a heavier weight, but uncoated nylon. By adding the PVC coating we're able to offer awesome protection (including fray resistance) with a lighter weight fabric. In terms of look and feel, the finer denier (basically thinner fibers) impart a softer hand-feel than you get from heavier denier bags.



As with all our products, we use premium materials throughout so the bag not only holds up but also resists scuffs and marks. It will continue to look good as you use it. 
Warranty: We stand by our product. The Continuum is guaranteed to be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for 5 years from the date of receipt. If a defect appears during the warranty period, we will repair or replace your product.
 

To get through security as quickly as possible, it helps to have a place you can easily stuff your phone, passport, watch and wallet. 
We created a special fleece-lined pocket for stashing your valuables as your bag gets x-rayed. Every time we use this little pocket, we're thankful we're not digging around for our stuff in the main compartment or leaving it in the bin.

The stash pocket incorporates a cable port to connect to the main compartment so you can charge your phone while it's tucked safely away by connecting to our included USB charger pocket.
 

Several successful bags on crowdfunding sites have featured some sort of built in charging apparatus. We respect the ambition here, but the problem with this is that the second you add electronics to soft goods, you dramatically increase the regulatory cost of production to get various international certifications (read: you get long delivery times).
We liked the idea of integrated charging, but we suspected that most of our prospective backers already had one or more USB chargers lying around. So we just made a pocket that will support most 3rd party chargers to charge less for the bag and get it to you more quickly. 

The lining of the Continuum is made of ripstop nylon and features recessed zippers on all interior pockets. The USB charger pocket has a velcro strap to hold your charger in place while leaving your USB port(s) accessible.
 

The Continuum's shoulder strap is wide and well padded so it's easy to carry and comfortable to wear.  

When you're not using the strap for the main bag, you can use it to convert the optional laptop sleeve into its own minimalist satellite bag.

The sleeve offers just enough room for a day of meetings or a session at coffee shop. When you are traveling, you'll finally be able to leave your main laptop bag at home. 
 

Shoes are the bane of any efficient packer's existence, especially if you want to work out while you're on a trip that requires more than a pair of trainers. The Continuum features two large shoe pockets - one on each end - so you can keep your footwear, workout gear or dirty laundry separated from the rest of your stuff.  Pockets are big enough for dress boots as shown below.
We stopped short of calling it a bag built for runners, but we never travel without a pair of running shoes and in our experience, it makes running while on the road a lot easier. 
 

One of the most useful features of the Continuum is what it does when you are not using it. Because of its soft shell and its boxy shape, it will actually hang up in a spot in your closet. If you'd prefer to compress it into a drawer or another bag that's fine too, but we like hanging it. 

 
Get you space back. If you live in a big city, then you know how precious space is. By replacing wheeled luggage, the Continuum will help you reclaim a little room until you need to use it. 
 

When it rains, you want your stuff to stay dry. The Continuum isn't waterproof, but we wanted to help you be prepared for inclement weather, so we included a rain cover.
Some manufacturers charge up to $40 for rain covers, but we wanted to include one with every bag, because you never realize how much you need one until after you need it. 

It's not the same as a dry bag, but you'll be glad you have it. Packs down into about 3""x6"".

We have two abiding travel fears: leaving our car keys back at the hotel room and having a delicious cold beer trapped in its own bottle. We decided to address them both by adding a bottle opener to our key keeper. 
The bottle opener is just a simple aluminum number, but if you have ever googled how to open a bottle without a bottle opener, then this bud's for you.

</div>Save the Ride Repeat Tour Earlier this season, Restless Longboards, Paris Trucks, Rollin boardshop, Concrete Wave and the Push Culture cup came together and purchased an RV in order to create The Ride Repeat Tour.  The goal was simple, give riders transportation and lodging to multiple events, help promote the growth of the sport and offer a safe environment for the practice DH longboarding. On site, it provided the crowd with entertainment, offered product visibility for our sponsors and shelter for riders. In the early morning hours of Monday August 11th, while coming back from the Downhill Throwdown, one of the Push Culture Cup stops, something terrible happen. Scaling the hills of Vermont proved to be too much for the RV. A hole the size of a fist was punched through the engine block and left our RV out of commission on the side of the road.

<h3>X'TREMFISHROD™ story</h3>
<p><b>The origin</b></p>
<p>This is the culmination of an idea came during a trekking in rainforest in Thailand where we have walked along a river without being able to fish in case of necessity or just enjoy fishing moments with friends. Once back home, we decided to design a fishing rod who can be easily carried in a pocket, a backpack or others similar items including the necessary to fish in fresh and salt water.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448901454/pybkb886wi7x60odjbgc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>Design</b></p>
<p>During the development phase, the product should meet the requirements in our technical specifications as <b>robust, compact, lightweight, ready to fish and affordable. </b></p>
<p>The most important point to be develop in the design phase was to preserve the rod to gather all the technical components while allowing the possibility to use X'TREMFISHROD™ as a survivor with just the reel, the hook and line. </p>
<p>Now, you need one second to decide your fishing mode thanks to the one second click to take off the rod.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">One rod, two modes... Let you drive by your instinct.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The distinctive design encloses all functions needed during fishing with the reel and its self-locking ring, the bobber, the lead-free sinker (selected to preserve the nature against toxic lead), the hook with its safe cap to protect you from injuries and a removable rod in fiber glass to make it strong and lightweight, to allow you to keep it smaller than you need.</p>

<p>X'TREMFISHROD™ was tested in real conditions using the 2 different modes. Sometimes in harsh environments with basic baits as a worm to simulate survival conditions, other times, with artificial lures or sweet corn.</p>
<p>The tests have been realized in different places and environments as on riverbed in Africa and Asia, in natural and artificial lakes and rivers in France and aboard ship on sea. </p>

X'TREMFISHROD™ story
The origin
This is the culmination of an idea came during a trekking in rainforest in Thailand where we have walked along a river without being able to fish in case of necessity or just enjoy fishing moments with friends. Once back home, we decided to design a fishing rod who can be easily carried in a pocket, a backpack or others similar items including the necessary to fish in fresh and salt water.

 
 
 


Trekking in Atlas Mountains, North Africa, 2015
 
Design
During the development phase, the product should meet the requirements in our technical specifications as robust, compact, lightweight, ready to fish and affordable. 
The most important point to be develop in the design phase was to preserve the rod to gather all the technical components while allowing the possibility to use X'TREMFISHROD™ as a survivor with just the reel, the hook and line. 
Now, you need one second to decide your fishing mode thanks to the one second click to take off the rod.

One rod, two modes... Let you drive by your instinct.
 
The distinctive design encloses all functions needed during fishing with the reel and its self-locking ring, the bobber, the lead-free sinker (selected to preserve the nature against toxic lead), the hook with its safe cap to protect you from injuries and a removable rod in fiber glass to make it strong and lightweight, to allow you to keep it smaller than you need.
 
 

Surely, the world's smallest fishing rod!
 
 

CAP'N HOOK™ - Safe Cap to secure hook
 
 

 

 
 

Sample of bobbers  - Adjustable along the line
 
Testing
Once the final prototype has been finished, we could begin the test phase. 
X'TREMFISHROD™ was tested in real conditions using the 2 different modes. Sometimes in harsh environments with basic baits as a worm to simulate survival conditions, other times, with artificial lures or sweet corn.
The tests have been realized in different places and environments as on riverbed in Africa and Asia, in natural and artificial lakes and rivers in France and aboard ship on sea. 
Some of us tested the street-fishing to enjoy the quality to get a complete and compact rod.  

 
 
The lightest weight on the market with only 20g in survival mode and the smallest complete fishing rod with an overall length of 270mm in tactical mode.
Built with its own accessory line.
Its small size makes a perfect buddy for an amazing improvised survival tool.
Developed, tested and made from high quality components selected in Provence, France.

<p><b>Stability and Reliability</b> - People's number one concern when they hear about Lumbos™ is that their feet will move out from underneath them, but nothing could be further from the truth. It seems counter-intuitive, but by having two feet that can turn independently, a rider is able to move more naturally and feels one with their board. When riders exert a load bearing force on one foot, the un-weighted foot is free to follow through and translate a rider’s intentions into more fluid swishing or swaying motions on slopes. Meanwhile, the weighted foot finds the most stable attack angle, keeping the other foot in check.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F1G2-c_UxczY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1G2-c_UxczY&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F1G2-c_UxczY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Fluidity of Motion</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> - With Lumbos™, riders can make quicker, smaller, and tighter turn radiuses. As one’s load bearing force is focused on the lead foot; the snowboard itself is able turn simultaneously under the un-weighted rear foot, much like surfing and skateboarding. This makes snowboarding a whole new experience, and much more fun!</span><p></p>
<p><b>Board Flex</b> - Approximately the same thickness as a pencil, Lumbos™ has minimal impact on flex or torsion. The turning turret is slightly raised above the board’s surface, not only to prevent marring, but to reduce impacting torsional flexibility.</p>
<p><b>Ease of Learning</b> - Because new boarders can try out any number of stances as they are learning, Lumbos™ makes learning to ride significantly easier for kids and adults of all ages.</p>
<div data-id=""4664151""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Thomas's daughter Sofia on Lumbos"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1452300562/x6rnb7otww0eqt4ylezx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption><i>Thomas's daughter Sofia on Lumbos</i></figcaption><figcaption> </figcaption><figcaption><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY OF BOARDING</b></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><b>The Fun Stuff</b> - Now, you can have unparalleled maneuverability and control of your snowboard, providing you with the ability to make split-second adjustments/decisions. Simply shifting your weight around and changing foot angles accordingly, you will be able to use any combination of positions/stances in a single run. Rethink all of the assumptions that you have made about how you perform tricks on your board—this is more like surfing or skateboarding, yet unprecedented. Maybe even with the potential to perform a snowboard 360˚ ""shove-it"" like Jeremy Jones!  [Disclaimer: Jeremy Jones is not riding on Lumbos™ in this video or affiliated with Lumbos™ in any way.]</p>

<p><b>The Comfort</b> - Never again will you need to face the dreaded snowboarder’s shuffle in the lift line, twisting your body uncomfortably and putting strain on the knees. By disconnecting one boot or the other from the binding, you can scoot along (so to speak), making it especially useful on flat terrain, or when going up hill for that matter. Imagine finally sitting in a chairlift comfortably without twisting of your body or legs. Lumbos™ allows you to let your legs dangle down freely and in a natural position. And when it’s time for a break, you can take a seat in the snow and choose to angle your foot and board in any direction that you want, so that you can relax, free from any excessive torquing of your knee.</p>

</div></div>","SEPT 2016 UPDATE - All-silver colored Lumbos are completely sold out for the 2016 season! However, you can still get a pair of your own Lumbos, as we have very limited numbers of black, blue, green, purple, or orange-colored Lumbos available to ship beginning Nov 2016. Please order via the perks on the right side of this page. There haven’t been any major changes to snowboarding in over 40 years. It's high time for an evolution.Lumbos™ Technology is a new type of snowboarding accessory that mounts between your board and your bindings, allowing one's feet to rotate bi-directionally for a more free and comfortable experience. This allows the rider to snowboard better, easier, safer, and funner than ever before!BENEFITS:Lumbos™ moves freely and is immediately responsive, allowing one to turn each foot independently at will on your snowboard, while remaining securely attached.Lumbos™ allows you to shift positions/stances at any given moment while standing or riding. Experience any combination of rides in every single run down the slopes.Lumbos™ allows quicker, tighter turns, increasing maneuverability and control of the snowboard; not to mention a plethora of more tricks.Lumbos™ reduces leg fatigue commonly associated with snowboarding. When it’s time for a break, a rider can take a seat in the snow and choose to angle their foot and board in any direction that they want, so that they can relax, free from any excessive torquing of the knees and spine.No more twisting and bending your knees in awkward positions while sitting on the lift or waiting in lift lines.  Navigate flat terrain like a skateboarder, even up-hill.Lumbos™ are designed to be compatible with virtually any brand or model snowboard or bindings, and will not damage them in any way.Lumbos™ installs quickly and easily in just a few simple steps with a Philips screwdriver.Lumbos™ are built to last a lifetime, constructed out of durable and corrosion-resistant stainless steel.One size fits all; meaning, a person can use the same pair as a junior rider and then keep on using them well into adulthood.With the revolutionary advent of Lumbos™ universal snowboarding accessory, it provides riders a pre-emptive pivot response to lengthen response time and reduce or cushion injurious forces. And give them a chance to save themselves in case of loss of balance. Lumbos™ allows users to better control, find, and use various positional options in navigating terrain and in case of falls. It is postulated that Lumbos™ would allow a rider a chance to relocate forces and regain control. Making the experience more like skateboarding and surfing.Lumbos™ has made it easier for beginners and experts to raise themselves from a kneeling, squatting, and sitting position. Lumbos™ all but eliminates fatigue associated with standing, skating, riding chair lifts and tow ropes. Allowing riders to comfortably navigate lift lines, congested areas, and flat terrain. Lumbos™ may reduce injuries common to snowboarders or lessen their effects. While there have been no studies conducted on the forces and pressures exerted on the body when snowboarding or at injury. Lumbos™ postulates that some of these may be reduced based on the ability of the rider to move from a fixed stance on the fly and only when initiated by the rider themselves. Empirical data gathered on the slopes reveals that the mechanism can not rotate without the volition of the rider. When both feet are planted on the board and gravitational forces are in play spontaneous movement is not observed. SAFETY
Stability and Reliability - People's number one concern when they hear about Lumbos™ is that their feet will move out from underneath them, but nothing could be further from the truth. It seems counter-intuitive, but by having two feet that can turn independently, a rider is able to move more naturally and feels one with their board. When riders exert a load bearing force on one foot, the un-weighted foot is free to follow through and translate a rider’s intentions into more fluid swishing or swaying motions on slopes. Meanwhile, the weighted foot finds the most stable attack angle, keeping the other foot in check.
Fluidity of Motion - With Lumbos™, riders can make quicker, smaller, and tighter turn radiuses. As one’s load bearing force is focused on the lead foot; the snowboard itself is able turn simultaneously under the un-weighted rear foot, much like surfing and skateboarding. This makes snowboarding a whole new experience, and much more fun!
Board Flex - Approximately the same thickness as a pencil, Lumbos™ has minimal impact on flex or torsion. The turning turret is slightly raised above the board’s surface, not only to prevent marring, but to reduce impacting torsional flexibility.
Ease of Learning - Because new boarders can try out any number of stances as they are learning, Lumbos™ makes learning to ride significantly easier for kids and adults of all ages.
Thomas's daughter Sofia on Lumbos AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY OF BOARDING
The Fun Stuff - Now, you can have unparalleled maneuverability and control of your snowboard, providing you with the ability to make split-second adjustments/decisions. Simply shifting your weight around and changing foot angles accordingly, you will be able to use any combination of positions/stances in a single run. Rethink all of the assumptions that you have made about how you perform tricks on your board—this is more like surfing or skateboarding, yet unprecedented. Maybe even with the potential to perform a snowboard 360˚ ""shove-it"" like Jeremy Jones!  [Disclaimer: Jeremy Jones is not riding on Lumbos™ in this video or affiliated with Lumbos™ in any way.]

The Comfort - Never again will you need to face the dreaded snowboarder’s shuffle in the lift line, twisting your body uncomfortably and putting strain on the knees. By disconnecting one boot or the other from the binding, you can scoot along (so to speak), making it especially useful on flat terrain, or when going up hill for that matter. Imagine finally sitting in a chairlift comfortably without twisting of your body or legs. Lumbos™ allows you to let your legs dangle down freely and in a natural position. And when it’s time for a break, you can take a seat in the snow and choose to angle your foot and board in any direction that you want, so that you can relax, free from any excessive torquing of your knee.
Regular snowboarders and Lumbos snowboarders on the chairlift. Can you see the difference? The Usefulness - Lumbos™ are designed to be compatible with virtually any brand or model snowboard or bindings. Lumbos™ are built to last a lifetime, constructed out of durable and corrosion-resistant stainless steel. One size fits all; meaning, a person can use the same pair as a junior rider and then keep on using them well into adulthood.
Lumbos is compatible with virtually all brands and models of snowboards and bindings PRODUCT FACTS

Lumbos™ will last a lifetime - Each pair is constructed from durable and corrosion-resistant stainless steel with an ultra low-friction coating.
Lumbos™ will never gum up, stick, or catch fire.

Lumbos™ are lightweight - Each unit weighs approx 1.5 lbs, making them approx 3 lbs for the pair (and working on making them even lighter.

Lumbos™ is/are easy to install - We timed several testers (adult and children) installing Lumbos™ on various snowboards and bindings. The average speed was approx 8-10 minutes. All you need to install it is a simple Philips screwdriver.

Lumbos™ won't damage or permanently alter your board in any way.

Lumbos™ has a very low profile - (approx. 3/8 inch) In fact, it has about the same width as a pencil!
Lumbos is as thin as a pencil (0.25 inches thick)
Lumbos are constructed out of high-grade stainless steel for its strength, durability, and anti-corrosive properties
 
Are you ready to try Lumbos™ and have fun?

Keep it on or tuck it away.Use the stuff sack separately or attach it to the pack - The choice is yours!  In the summer of 2016, we set out on a 4-day hike into the Garabaldi's. With over 7,600ft of elevation, our gear had to be light, compact, durable and built with maximum utility to not weigh us down - we managed to get our packs down to 60lbs. The one thing that was missing was a backpack that we could take with us on our day trips out from basecamp. A backpack that would be large enough to carry our day trip gear, light enough to not weigh us down on the way up, yet durable enough to survive our rugged journey. The Sea to Sky pack was born out of necessity. We designed the pack to be large enough to fit everything we needed, yet small and light enough to conserve space and weight. After going through dozens of prototypes and iterations, we finally created a bag we were happy to call our own.        ---- Lightweight | Waterproof | Compact | Durable | Functional | Beautiful ----The Sea to Sky Pack is made for all you world travelers and adventure seekers.
