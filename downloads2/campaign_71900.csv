<p>Hi, our names are Courtney Bell and Anya Ranganathan. We are Duke seniors and the co-founders of Ungraded Produce, an <strong>affordable ""ugly produce"" delivery service</strong> that reduces food waste. </p>
<p>Food waste is a huge problem because our food industry demands perfection. Produce that is deemed less-than-perfect is rejected from supermarkets due to strict <i>cosmetic</i> standards that have nothing to do with taste, nutrition, or shelf-life. Farmers are in turn discouraged from harvesting these ‘less saleable’ products.</p>
<p>The environmental and economic impacts of food waste are MASSIVE. In the United States alone, discarded food accounts for $165B of annual spending, 4% of US oil consumption, 33 million tons of landfill waste, and 16% of methane emissions. Every day, Americans waste enough food to fill a <strong>90,000-seat football stadium!</strong></p>
<p>We decided it was <u>time to take action</u>. In June 2015, we founded Ungraded Produce to challenge the food system’s obsession with perfection. Ungraded Produce is an online, subscription-based delivery service that distributes “ugly produce” at a discount. In line with our stance against waste, we source high quality produce that does not meet the appearance standards to sell in commercial markets due to atypical size, shape, or coloration. Nothing is bruised, old, less tasty, or less nutritious!</p>
<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customers sign up for a subscription at <a href=""http://ungradedproduce.com/get-started/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ungradedproduce.com</a>. Every other week, subscribers have a box of ugly produce delivered to their homes.</li>
<li>We offer three core products: a 5 lb, 10 lb, and 15 lb box of ugly produce. Each box contains <strong>4-7 varieties</strong> of “ugly” produce sourced from <strong>North Carolina farms</strong>. Our products are priced <strong>30-50% cheaper</strong> than grocery store comparables.</li>
</ul>
<h3>THE BENEFITS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ungraded Produce helps connect farmers with misshapen and surplus product with consumers who want high quality, low-cost fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li>We compensate farmers fairly for their high quality but atypical-looking products. Our suppliers are happy to see that their labor of love is reaching consumers!</li>
<li>Our convenient home delivery model and low prices help more people access affordable, high quality products.</li>
</ul>
<h3>OUR PROGRESS</h3>
<p><i>“Even in relatively equal societies, welfare can be increased without increase in consumption by consuming differently, rather than consuming more.”</i></p>
<p> <i>       -- Ha-Joon Chang</i></p>
<p>Since founding Ungraded Produce in June 2015, we’ve continued to remain inspired by this quote. Ungraded’s vision is twofold. First, we aim to <strong>challenge perceptions</strong> of what constitutes “marketable” produce. Second, we want to <strong>fight against food waste</strong> by diverting viable product towards buyers. By selling ugly and excess produce, Ungraded <strong>reduces inefficiencies in the farming system</strong>.</p>
<p>We officially launched Ungraded Produce in September 2016. During our pilot, we distributed thousands of pounds of produce to our subscribers. Since then, the demand for Ungraded Produce has grown dramatically!</p>
<p>January 28 will mark the beginning of the Spring 2017 subscription period. We hope to have 500 subscribers by the end of 2017, and need funding to support a growing customer base. Here is a summary of what your contributions will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery vehicles</li>
<li>Rent for storage space</li>
<li>Integrating eCommerce, automatic billing, and delivery management into our website</li>
<li>Marketing initiatives</li>
<li>Fees for licenses</li>
<li>Legal assistance</li>
</ul>
<h3>WHY INVEST IN UNGRADED?</h3>
<p>We want to make our service available to thousands of people throughout North Carolina and beyond, all while remaining committed to compensating growers <strong>fairly</strong>, providing an <strong>affordable</strong> and <strong>convenien</strong>t product, and using <strong>sustainable</strong> practices. But in order to do this, <strong>we will need your help!</strong></p>
<p>Your contributions will help us grow in a number of ways. As a startup, we currently have have limited resources to invest in delivery vehicles, e-commerce infrastructure, marketing campaigns, and additional members to add to our two-person team. But all of these are instrumental in helping us <strong>recover</strong> and <strong>reintegrate</strong> as much food back into the market as possible! </p>

<li>
<strong>Community</strong> - Having somewhere to go to ask questions, get advice, learn, and meet folks in your neighborhood is important! We think our city deserves more accessible spaces for learning and experimentation - so we’re building one!</li>
<li>
<strong>Creativity</strong> - Making tools accessible means lowering the stakes for creating! Try something new, take a chance, and make some art! Tool libraries create new opportunities for building and imagination. </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Tiny Victory is something of a homecoming for Ian Merryman. TV is located at 506 W. Broad Street in historic Jackson Ward. This isn't his first dance in this space. In 2016, Ian was the chef of the awesome, but too short-lived restaurant, Antler &amp; Fin (who, like mentioned...was housed at 506 W. Broad St.) There's something vindicating about returning to this space with his own project (which he co-owns with partner, Devon Halbert and long-time friend/co-worker Mark Frenier.) Antler &amp; Fin never got to achieve its true potential, but Ian has returned with a Tiny Victory of his own...</p>

</div><p><b>A Different Kind of
Tech Service</b></p>
<p>How often do you get
frustrated with your IT Company?  Do you
find that they simply don’t deal with issues quick enough? That they don’t see
you as a priority? Or do you simply feel that the service you are being billed
for just isn’t there? This is a common problem today; many companies believe
that they are being treated poorly and paying too much for the privilege.</p>
<p>Here at Evolve IT
Solutions, we plan to change that for good. Having been in the IT and
Technology game for 12 years, we’ve seen it all and we’ve been treated badly by
those IT companies. Customer service doesn’t exist with many of them and that’s
what we want to change.</p>
<p>Evolve It Solutions is
offering you a brand new deal. We are offering you high quality customer
service, a service that is fully aligned with your technology needs and your
business goals. We will offer you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed
     services</li>
<li>Business
     Continuity Planning</li>
<li>Backup
     Disaster and Recovery</li>
<li>IT
     Consulting</li>
<li>On-Demand
     services</li>
<li>Cloud
     services</li>
<li>Email
     and Spam protection</li>
<li>Hosted
     solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>And much more besides.
And all of that with a professional customer service that works for you not
against you. We are focusing our service on small to medium business, providing
an efficient and accurate way for them to focus their attention on their
business, without having to worry about the IT end of things.</p>
<p>We’ve done our
homework. We’ve talked to CIO’s and partners of some of the bigger companies
and asked them what they think the biggest source of frustration is – they all
agree that it comes down to the IT company not having a true grasp of the
business model and not providing what the company needs to service that
business model. </p>
<p>Competition is rife in
in the IT industry. There are so many companies that, instead of charging by
the hour, they now go on a monthly contract, winning the business of companies
by putting in competitive bids. We are a little more traditional than that –
we’ll offer you a monthly contract and by the hour charging which means we can
offer you the most competitive deal.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What
You Get</b></p>
<p>Ok, so here’s the
crunch. We are already up and running, we work for two businesses in Dallas but
we want to be able to expand, offer more. We want to be able to pull together the
tools and monitoring systems that will help us to provide you with the service
you are paying for and we want to get cloud accounts set up for standardization.
As well as that, we would love to be able to hire a professional web designer,
someone who can put together a user-friendly website that includes forms and
easier ways to contact us.</p>
<p>So, we are asking for just
$10,000 to help us expand our services. If we break that barrier, any money
over and above our target will be donated to <b>Big Brother, Big Sister </b>and<b>
Homeless Teens</b> and, once we are all set up, we will be donating to both of these
charities on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>For your donation, you
will be rewarded with:</p>
<ul>
<li>$100 will get you a personalized thank you message</li>
<li>$500 will get you will get you a personalized thank you message</li>
<li>$1,000 will get you a lifetime sponsor spot on our website</li>
<li>$2,000 will get you a lifetime sponsor spot on our website and personal video from me</li>

</blockquote></div>","A Different Kind of
Tech Service
How often do you get
frustrated with your IT Company?  Do you
find that they simply don’t deal with issues quick enough? That they don’t see
you as a priority? Or do you simply feel that the service you are being billed
for just isn’t there? This is a common problem today; many companies believe
that they are being treated poorly and paying too much for the privilege.
Here at Evolve IT
Solutions, we plan to change that for good. Having been in the IT and
Technology game for 12 years, we’ve seen it all and we’ve been treated badly by
those IT companies. Customer service doesn’t exist with many of them and that’s
what we want to change.
Evolve It Solutions is
offering you a brand new deal. We are offering you high quality customer
service, a service that is fully aligned with your technology needs and your
business goals. We will offer you:

Managed
     services
Business
     Continuity Planning
Backup
     Disaster and Recovery
IT
     Consulting
On-Demand
     services
Cloud
     services
Email
     and Spam protection
Hosted
     solutions

And much more besides.
And all of that with a professional customer service that works for you not
against you. We are focusing our service on small to medium business, providing
an efficient and accurate way for them to focus their attention on their
business, without having to worry about the IT end of things.
We’ve done our
homework. We’ve talked to CIO’s and partners of some of the bigger companies
and asked them what they think the biggest source of frustration is – they all
agree that it comes down to the IT company not having a true grasp of the
business model and not providing what the company needs to service that
business model. 
Competition is rife in
in the IT industry. There are so many companies that, instead of charging by
the hour, they now go on a monthly contract, winning the business of companies
by putting in competitive bids. We are a little more traditional than that –
we’ll offer you a monthly contract and by the hour charging which means we can
offer you the most competitive deal.
What We Need & What
You Get
Ok, so here’s the
crunch. We are already up and running, we work for two businesses in Dallas but
we want to be able to expand, offer more. We want to be able to pull together the
tools and monitoring systems that will help us to provide you with the service
you are paying for and we want to get cloud accounts set up for standardization.
As well as that, we would love to be able to hire a professional web designer,
someone who can put together a user-friendly website that includes forms and
easier ways to contact us.
So, we are asking for just
$10,000 to help us expand our services. If we break that barrier, any money
over and above our target will be donated to Big Brother, Big Sister and
Homeless Teens and, once we are all set up, we will be donating to both of these
charities on a quarterly basis.
For your donation, you
will be rewarded with:

$100 will get you a personalized thank you message
$500 will get you will get you a personalized thank you message
$1,000 will get you a lifetime sponsor spot on our website
$2,000 will get you a lifetime sponsor spot on our website and personal video from me

Other Ways You Can
Help
We know that there are
thousands of people, businesses looking to get off the ground so if you want to
learn more about ours, take a look at the following links. And, if you like
what you see, pass the word onto your friends and families.

the kids involved in the design, and engage the community through its premier at the
Market Street Prototyping Festival. Our class is helping to facilitate the group of designers
comprised of middle school kids from San Francisco Friends School, Everett Middle School,
and the French American International School who have been working diligently over the
last month to design and prototype their ideal urban playscape. Our role is to design an integrative structure that can provide a sense of environment for
the playscapes to perform within. It will provide shade and a feeling of enclosure, the
vertical element to compliment their horizontal urban obstacle course. We have been
working closely with the kids so that our design can better respond to their ideas and to
gain inspiration from their energy and creativity. The Market Street Prototyping Festival, running April 9-11 2015, is an opportunity to
transform how we envision Market Street as a public space, and to promote civic
engagement through design. Our collaboration with KIDmob has been selected as one of
fifty unique installations, but our budget is very tight and we need to secure more funding
to truly realize our combined vision!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We will provide extra services such as natural rock climbing outings , birthday parties, basic climbing courses and of course we will organize the Second Climbing Championship in Chiapas! ¿Que queremos hacer? Hemos encontrado dos espacios nuevos para la sala de escalada, en Tuxtla Gutierrez y San Cristobal de las Casas en propiedades de amigos, que nos cobran una renta mucho mas baja y con mas espacio para crecer.  Estamos dispuestos a construir los muros de nuevo, incluyendo una torre techada. Utilizaremos toda la experiencia que hemos aprendido de la Roca para construir el muro nosotros, e implementaremos un sistema de membresias que apoyará a sostener al gimnasio a largo plazo. Esperamos incluir una sección de escalada deportiva (usando cuerdas) donde podemos practicar diversas técnicas verticales. Proveeremos servicios extra como salidas a la roca natural, fiestas de cumpleaños, cursos de escalada básicas y por supuesto organizaremos el segundo campeonato estatal de Escalada en Chiapas!    
What perks do we offer? 
For your generous donations we are offerering unique La Roca Sala de Escalada bumper stickers, Chiapas climbing guides, La Roca Sala de Escalada t-shirts, your name or logo on the  climbing wall, climbing wall memberships (if you live in Chiapas) or sponsor a low-income child's climbing wall membership!  For the more generous donations, we are offering a whole free day or weekend of guided climbing on the date of your choosing in one of our many climbing zones in Chiapas, one year and unlimited memberships and a trip to the unique and virgin la Venta Canyon! ¿Cuales incentivos ofrecemos?Para sus donaciones generosas estamos ofreciendo calcomanías de la Roca Sala de Escalada, Guias de Escalada en Chiapas, playeras de la Roca, tu nombre o logo en el muro de escalada, membresías para usar el muro (si vives en Chiapas) o patrocina una membresia de un niño de bajos recursos. Para las donaciones generosas, estamos ofreciendo un dia completo de escalada o un fin de semana en la fecha que escojas en una de las varias zonas de escalada en Chiapas, membresías de un año o ilimitados y un viaje al unico y virgen Cañón río la Venta!",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Come Grow with Us!</b></p>
<p>Come grow with us! Be part of our dream; the magic
&amp; love of chocolate made by hand in small batches.</p>
<p>We are Mike &amp; Emily, the owners and creators of
Lune Chocolat: Syracuse's only natural, artisan, handmade chocolatier. We have
been in business since September 2011.Together we make most of the pieces that
go out our door. We are
dedicated to furthering its growth and success.</p>
<p>We take great pride in running a business where the
staff and patrons feel at home and happy. Mike received his MBAin
2010 from Syracuse University and Emily is an artist by trade, who learned the
art of chocolate at the Culinary Institute at Hyde Park. Lune Chocolat employs
5-8 workers (scheduling varies based on their college and school commitments)
who we love like family. </p>
<p>Our goal has always been to work together. Our
daily business and wholesale accounts both continue to grow, and for this we are thankful.
This is what has brought us to the decision to run this campaign. We have outgrown
our current space of 480 square feet. When you have three employees working in
the kitchen, while the do-Si-do's we do are bountiful and elegant, we need more
space to be more productive. This campaign will help us achieve our goal to
move to a building we can (hopefully) own and allow us to work together full
time. </p>
<p>**************************************************</p>
<p><b>What We
Need &amp; What You Get:</b></p>
<p>We are hoping
to raise $25,000 in this campaign. </p>
<p>Money raised
through this campaign will go toward new equipment, which will
also allow us to bring you, our customer, NEW creations! One of those products is popsicles. For this, we
will need molds and a blast freezer. Easy as pie...and then we will knock it
out of the ball park with flavors...something like watermelon-basil-mango or strawberry
balsamic- coconut. And don't forget chocolate popsicles! We would also like to apply
part of the funds to professional fees we have incurred. It has been a long
road to get to this spot. Part of what we raise will also go towards being
closed for a few days while we move all the equipment and product to our new
location. (Being closed. That will be super weird!)</p>
<p>In
appreciation of your support, there will be chocolate! We will also have wine &amp;
spirits gift cards, t-shirts, hats, pens, and magnets. As well as some other
very fun perks, from local spas, farmers and chefs (we will announce something
new every time we reach a goal of our fundraising)..</p>
<p>We hope
that you will join us in this journey; it’s bound to be full of adventure for
all of us. </p>
<p>*********************************************************</p>
<p><b>The
Impact:</b></p>
<p>We draw
people to Manlius from all over. Our chocolate has been shipped worldwide, to
Sweden, France, England, and it has traveled to The Galapagos. We have regular
customers from Toronto, Schenectady, Boston, and Connecticut. We also draw
people from various cities close by, Oswego, Binghamton, Bernhards Bay, and
more. These people come back, the love visiting and seeing the new creations.
They are excited for our growth. </p>
<p>This
campaign is to raise money for equipment which will create new products which
will bring in new customers. It will also help cover the professional fees we
have from the process of purchasing a commercial property. These things
include: architectural drawings, permits, signage, lawyer fees, construction
costs, and hopefully some direct mail advertising to announce the opening. It
will also let us breathe a little easier on those few days we have to move
equipment and be closed.</p>
<p>**************************************************************</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We have
faced obstacles along this path of growth. Originally, we were looking at
another property and we struggled to get the zoning changed. This was a process
of loss of time and money because in the end we had to let it go. We are not
quitters. Once we let it go, we picked ourselves up and found the property we
are now working on. We have started construction. We are so close. </p>
<p>It's so
surreal, but it's so exciting. And then sometimes, it’s very scary.</p>
<p>We want
to keep moving, to keep growing, and to keep getting things done. A recent
quote I heard, ""<i>Sometimes when life
doesn't seem fair and you know everything you put into it is way more than you
will ever get back, just remember this, no matter how hopeless it may seem, you
are still way ahead of everyone who never tried at all</i>.""(C.Clark2015) We never stop
trying. That way we never stop learning.</p>

<p>As Zane Lamprey
said it in one of his Chug episodes, ""craft beer is all about bringing people together
that share a common interest.""  </p>
<p>We used to go to the typical bars, but about 2 years ago we discovered craft beer.

<p>Before I tell
you how you can help, I’d like to share with you how we came up with the

<p>“Hops — one of the key ingredients in
craft beers — was grown in Ohio until the early 1900s, until pressure from
disease and insects caused farmers to give up growing the crop.  Today, an estimated $4 million worth of
hops are imported into Ohio.  But thanks
to a two-year specialty crop grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and
Ohio Department of Agriculture, as well as interest by growers across the
state, there is faith the crop can be revived. 
As a result, a Hop Yard Plot is being tested in Wooster, OH.  The Hop Yard Plot fea<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">tures a quarter-acre

<p>We would like
to lease the building where the former café was housed.  We need to remove all the coffee and food
handling equipment, paint the dark walls a lighter color, put in new flooring, add additional tap handles and a kegerator, install booth
seating, do some electrical work and buy some used bar stools.  We also need to purchase a merchandiser, renew the liquor license, obtain business insurance, buy a POS system and pay rent and utilities.  Wow, there is so much to starting a new business!</p>

As Zane Lamprey
said it in one of his Chug episodes, ""craft beer is all about bringing people together
that share a common interest.""  
We used to go to the typical bars, but about 2 years ago we discovered craft beer. We started going to this little place called The Garden Café on Broadway in downtown Grove City.  We felt welcome right away and knew this was a different kind of place, not the typical bar crowd. It felt a little more sophisticated and we started meeting new people right away. The owners at the time, Will Roberts and Carol Alberts were amazing!  They made the place extremely successful and made everyone feel at home.  Unfortunately, that little café was sold and since then things have not been the same. The entire community misses the fun little craft beer bar, the place where life long friendships begin!    So,,,,we bought the bar!We hope to bring the locals back to the place where it all started.

<p><b>                                                     Can you help Laya?</b></p>
<p>Our precious daughter Laya was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular
Atrophy Type 1 (SMA 1) when she was just 8 months old. Laya is now nearly 5. SMA1
is a life limiting condition without a cure. Laya cannot walk, crawl or even
sit by herself. She has very poor head control and she has extremely weak
muscles. For instance a small apple is too heavy for her to hold. Although
profoundly disabled, Laya’s brain is completely unaffected by her condition, she
is very bright, loves to sing, read, tell stories and chat!</p>
<p>A year ago, her current wheelchair, Wizzy Bug, gave Laya her
first taste of independence. For the first time she didn’t need to be pushed or
carried, she was able to move in a direction that she chose, where and when she
wanted to.  We will never forget her smile on that day, it’s a memory we
will always treasure. She has now outgrown Wizzy, which is a pre-school wheelchair for toddlers.<br/></p>
<p>Laya is very special as there are only a
small handful of children around the world with SMA1 who have survived passed
the age of two.  Because Laya is a bit of an anomaly she doesn't quite fit
into any specific category and so we have struggled greatly to get any charity
or government funding for a powered wheelchair that will give Laya this level
of independence. This is why we have decided to fundraise ourselves.  The cost is out of our reach. </p>
<p>We really believe that with the right support (and a lot of love❤)
Laya will continue to thrive and love life.  This is why we desperately
want to raise the money to buy her a Snap Dragon wheelchair, it will completely
open up her world and enable her to keep her independence. You only need to
watch Laya's video to realise how much she wants and needs this wheelchair
(link at top of the page).</p>
<p>With your help we might be able to give Laya what she needs! </p>

Frog Fragrances began over 4 years ago from my home doing markets and festivals
while still working full time.  After 2 years I was ready to take the next
step and resigned from my full time job as General Manager of an international
company to pursue my passion.  After another twelve months it was time for
the next big step and move into a production/retail space and out of my home
and kitchen where I had been making all the candles and wax melts. <br/><p>
<br/>
I am passionate about educating people on good quality candles and soy
wax.  I do this by writing blogs, making videos, speaking to customers in
my store and now running candle making classes.  I want to spread this
knowledge further by having my products in more stores not just in Australia
but worldwide.  Our new packaging will tell our story and show the
benefits of our ingredients on them.<br/>
<br/>
So where did the business name come from? Living in country Queensland,
Australia, green frogs are normal to have in your toilet or even in your boots
if you don't turn them upside down.  So when deciding on a name for my
business I chose Green Frog Fragrances.  </p>

<br/>
We already have nearly 50 stores around Australia selling our products and we
want to expand into more stores.  To do this we require new packaging
including bar codes for all products.  With 35 fragrances in our full
range and 4 sizes of candles and 2 sizes of melts there is a lot required to
revamp our packaging.  I want to take my products internationally and to do
this we need quality packaging.  I have done a lot of research and found
the perfect packaging for our new frog melts which will keep them safe but
attractive to sell on shelves in any store.<br/>
<br/>
With your help I will be able to reach more people to educate them on the
benefits of 100% soy wax and what they are breathing in when burning cheaper
candles. So many candles on the market don't list their ingredients which is
concerning that you don't know what it is made of.  A lot of cheaper
candles are made with paraffin wax which is made from petroleum.  This is
not good for the environment or our health. 
Soy wax is made from soya beans and I only use the best quality that is
not genetically modified and made specifically for use in candles.  </p>
<p>I am conscious even more so these days on what I am breathing in as well
as consuming.  </p>
<p>With this in mind I want to be able to educate customers even if I’m not
there.  By having this information on the
packaging it doesn’t matter where in the world it is sold the customer can read
about the benefits of soy wax, cotton paper wicks and body safe fragrance oil –
all components of my candles and melts.</p>
<p>I am also aware that our current labels are not easy to read in the smaller sizes and these need to be redesigned with the new design of boxes for the candles.<br/>
<br/>
I have broken down our budget<br/>
New candle label design $3000<br/>
New candle packaging &amp; printing $7400<br/>

Frog Fragrances began over 4 years ago from my home doing markets and festivals
while still working full time.  After 2 years I was ready to take the next
step and resigned from my full time job as General Manager of an international
company to pursue my passion.  After another twelve months it was time for
the next big step and move into a production/retail space and out of my home
and kitchen where I had been making all the candles and wax melts. 

I am passionate about educating people on good quality candles and soy
wax.  I do this by writing blogs, making videos, speaking to customers in
my store and now running candle making classes.  I want to spread this
knowledge further by having my products in more stores not just in Australia
but worldwide.  Our new packaging will tell our story and show the
benefits of our ingredients on them.

So where did the business name come from? Living in country Queensland,
Australia, green frogs are normal to have in your toilet or even in your boots
if you don't turn them upside down.  So when deciding on a name for my
business I chose Green Frog Fragrances.  
In the
beginning I wanted to make the soy wax melts in the shape of frogs but the
molds were quite expensive so I put that idea on the back burner but never
forgot about it.  One day I was talking to a customer who was taking the
candle making class and he said he had an idea how I could make the molds
myself.  This started a process off and now I have made a few molds with 2
sizes of frogs to suit our existing product line of small wax chips for small
oil burners and larger wax melts for bigger oil burners.

<li>We need £10,000 i) to plant our first hectares, with the best available agronomic advice and ii) to build on existing hydroponic trials.   We will use the revenue from the crops we plant, to expand and replant, so that the business continues: we reinvest our profits.

<p><b>Economic</b></p>
<p>We can multiply your money for Rwanda: we can use it to build up a sustainable business, built on both conventional and hydroponic production of horticultural crops in an environmentally sustainable way.  The potential is enormous because local and regional markets are growing very fast.  We will select only the most profitable and robust crops to grow conventionally, and we will develop hydroponics methods that are profitable in Rwanda.  Hydroponics tends to have high production per square metre compared to conventional agriculture, and therefore trials could lead to new sources of profit for us and for many other Rwandan farmers.  Ultimately, we aim to work with partners to replicate what works for us, with other farmers, and therefore help create jobs and income for Rwandan people.  </p>
<p><b>Environmental</b></p>
<p>Most hydroponics is many times more water-efficient than normal agriculture: one litre of water can produce a higher volume of crop.  Hydroponics is also more land-efficient than normal agriculture: one square metre of land can produce a higher volume of crop, and does not cause soil erosion or depletion.  Your money will help us make this work well in Rwanda.  We will also use and promote the use of the best home-grown and regionally proven sustainable land management methods to minimise soil depletion and maximise efficient land use.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Social</b></p>
<p>We aim to foster a positive image for agriculture for talented young Rwandans and to lure talent into the sector, to take the problem of food production and sustainable land use seriously.  We will also operate in a way that is sensitive to local community contexts, and operate according to a 'do no harm' principle.  Once we are more mature, we will contribute surplus that is not reinvested to build the company, to Aegis Trust, an international genocide prevention organisation working to build social cohesion. </p>

If we don't reach our goal, or if we exceed the goal, we will use the funds we get to plant as much land as we are able, and extend hydroponics trials.     The Impact 
Economic
We can multiply your money for Rwanda: we can use it to build up a sustainable business, built on both conventional and hydroponic production of horticultural crops in an environmentally sustainable way.  The potential is enormous because local and regional markets are growing very fast.  We will select only the most profitable and robust crops to grow conventionally, and we will develop hydroponics methods that are profitable in Rwanda.  Hydroponics tends to have high production per square metre compared to conventional agriculture, and therefore trials could lead to new sources of profit for us and for many other Rwandan farmers.  Ultimately, we aim to work with partners to replicate what works for us, with other farmers, and therefore help create jobs and income for Rwandan people.  
Environmental
Most hydroponics is many times more water-efficient than normal agriculture: one litre of water can produce a higher volume of crop.  Hydroponics is also more land-efficient than normal agriculture: one square metre of land can produce a higher volume of crop, and does not cause soil erosion or depletion.  Your money will help us make this work well in Rwanda.  We will also use and promote the use of the best home-grown and regionally proven sustainable land management methods to minimise soil depletion and maximise efficient land use.

Social
We aim to foster a positive image for agriculture for talented young Rwandans and to lure talent into the sector, to take the problem of food production and sustainable land use seriously.  We will also operate in a way that is sensitive to local community contexts, and operate according to a 'do no harm' principle.  Once we are more mature, we will contribute surplus that is not reinvested to build the company, to Aegis Trust, an international genocide prevention organisation working to build social cohesion. 
The big picture: The vision of Afroponics is a thriving and innovative
agribusiness that contributes to food security and sustainable peace in Rwanda,
and is part of the solution to the growing global scarcity of land and water
resources.  The mission of Afroponics is to work towards food security by
exploring, demonstrating and replicating commercially successful agriculture in
Rwanda according to the principles of best practice in sustainable land
management.
    Risks & Challenges We can find land; we can find expertise, and we can certainly find markets.  Our main challenge is to find money to start off.  Our laser-like focus on commercial viability (from our starting points of economics and business respectively) will ensure that we will plan well and make good use of people's money. In addition to crowdfunding, we will approach multiple funding sources.

<p>Let's face it, many of us have every intention of eating healthy, but we still tend to reach for that overly processed, high calorie junk food that just results in the spiking and crashing of our blood sugar levels. This can wreak havoc on our minds and bodies, causing anything from headaches and mood swings, to losing our ability to focus and concentrate.</p>
<p>At Kraze Foods, our goal is to provide you with high quality, nutrition-dense foods that are healthy and bursting with flavor. We are focused on creating raw food snacks that appeal to people from all walks of life, not just raw foods enthusiasts.</p>

For example, did you know that walnuts support brain and heart health? Did you also know that pecans are rich in magnesium, a mineral known for its anti-inflammatory properties? And cashews are known cancer fighters. Good stuff, right? Down to the last ingredient, we have health in mind when creating our products. Just a handful of our nuts will give you the natural energy boost you need…your body will thank you, too!</p>

<p><b>Long Story Short…</b></p>
<p>We never thought we would be here: in the last place
we ever dreamed of being, doing the last thing we ever dreamed of doing.
Together, raising a child of our own in the small town in which we were raised,
farming for a living…</p>
<p>Though we farm full-time, it is not on land of our
own. Another small-farm family, the Howells of <a href=""http://www.needmoreacres.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hickory Lane Farm</a>, are not only
teaching us how to farm, and how to do good within our community through
farming, but have also encouraged us to begin our own farm business from the
produce we help grow on the farm. Think Little, a year-round twenty member CSA, is our way
of making a living while learning to operate a farm business. Without them,
we may never have realized our dream of becoming a farm family.</p>
<p>However, despite the unbelievable opportunity the Howell
family has given Think Little, we need to begin thinking about the future. We’re
unable to get a loan for equipment because of our outstanding student loan debt and grants/cost-shares
will not cover the cost of one central piece of equipment: the tractor. Currently,
our family is leasing a few acres of land on which we are able to grow our own
produce, which will allow us to expand our small CSA to the point of saving
money. By growing a little more over the next few years, we hope to be able
save enough for a down payment on land of our own. Our campaign is for a walk-behind tractor and
the implements needed to begin cultivating our few acres of leased land. <br/></p><p>Year one will entail growing fresh herbs and flowers on our leased land for both the Hickory Lane and Think Little CSAs. Currently, we do not depend heavily on market sales, but will earn additional income as there are currently few fresh herb options within our local market. By the Winter, we will have acquired an additional high-tunnel (to our name) for expanding our capacity to grow vegetables for the two CSAs year-round. Year two is when we will begin to expand our fruit and vegetable production to supplement what is grown on Hickory Lane so that we may then increase the number of CSA members to approximately 30.<br/></p>
<p>A small contribution here, today, will create a
wealth of produce for not only more CSA members, but for low-income families as
well. Food access is built into our CSA model. For every four members, we
provide a free CSA share to a low-income family through <a href=""http://hotelincbg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HOTEL INC</a> (a local
non-profit serving those who demonstrate a need in our community) for three months of
the year. More so, we hope to one day provide the same opportunities for aspiring young
farmers that have been given to us by the Howell family.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the equipment we need, we’re asking for an even
$8,000. Here’s the breakdown:</p>

from which we will be purchasing the following items: <a href=""http://www.earthtoolsbcs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.earthtoolsbcs.com</a> **</p>
<p>In case we do not reach our goal, the money will be spent in the order of the
list above. First, we’ll purchase the tractor, then the plow, and so on.
However, if we go above our goal, the money will be used to purchase plastic
mulch, drip irrigation tape, seed, and other small implements (we’ll cross
that bridge when we come to it if we get close to our goal). </p><br/><p></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The short-term impact of a successful campaign will
give us the tools we need, along with the continuing support of Hickory Lane Farm, to
expand our CSA for the 2015-2016 season. Our goal is to have a total of 30 CSA
members by our second quarter (April) of 2016. The result will be an additional
$11,000/year in membership, allowing us to reinvest a substantial portion in our business (nearly doubling
the return on the investment within two years), and the addition of
three more twelve-week shares to be given to low-income families (rounding up,
for those of you doing the math). You can follow our progress on the farm blog: <a href=""http://www.thinklittlecsa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thinklittlecsa.com</a></p>
<p>The long-term impact of a successful campaign is an
investment in one small-farm family focused on food access. Unfortunately,
these are rare, but the number of us who are concerned first with a fair and
equitable local food system is growing (we are lucky to have some of them as
mentors). Farmers have a unique role in providing food security not only for the
average consumers of a given region, but also in closing the gap between local farms and those without adequate access and
good whole foods. Further, we work just as hard off the farm advocating for
food access in other arenas: farmers markets, public health, policy/regulation, non-profits,
and other grassroots organizations. Being a stronger producer will give us a stronger voice in those arenas. Our long-term goal, besides sustaining a
small family farm indefinitely, is to raise enough awareness, and inspire
enough action, about food insecurity to put our particular CSA model out of business.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Qualifications</b></p><p>For the sake of brevity, here's a quick list:</p><p>&gt; Our year-round CSA has a retention rate of 85% within it's first year<br/>&gt; Former <a href=""http://cfaky.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Community Farm Alliance</a> Farmers Market Support Fellow<br/>          Assisted 6 other Eastern KY markets with Double Dollar/outreach programs<br/>          The program is now offered to 20+ KY markets in low-income communities<br/>          * Did not renew the fellowship to pursue farming full-time<br/>&gt; Current Outreach Co-coordinator for <a href=""communityfarmersmarketbg.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Community Farmers Market</a><br/>          CFM started the first Double Dollar program for SNAP/WIC in the state of KY<br/>          Acquired an additional $20,000 in grant funding for the Mobile Market project<br/></p>

enough action, about food insecurity to put our particular CSA model out of business.QualificationsFor the sake of brevity, here's a quick list:> Our year-round CSA has a retention rate of 85% within it's first year> Former Community Farm Alliance Farmers Market Support Fellow          Assisted 6 other Eastern KY markets with Double Dollar/outreach programs          The program is now offered to 20+ KY markets in low-income communities          * Did not renew the fellowship to pursue farming full-time> Current Outreach Co-coordinator for Community Farmers Market          CFM started the first Double Dollar program for SNAP/WIC in the state of KY          Acquired an additional $20,000 in grant funding for the Mobile Market project

Other Ways You Can Help
Lastly, if you’re able to give, that’s
awesome! If you want to give more, also consider a donation to HOTEL INC or the Community Farmers Market Double Dollars Program. If not, here are some other ways you can help our mission to support beginning farmers and the connection between local farms and low-income communities:
· 
Spend some of your budgeted food dollars with local
farmers at a farmers market or at establishments that support local farms. Further, encourage your local market to accept SNAP benefits (see MarketLink).
· 
Share some of the good work other organizations
are doing in your community regarding food access, which is easy to do via
social media.
· 
Ask local farmers for permission to glean
seconds for local food pantries.
· 
Spread the word about our Think Little campaign!!!** If you're in TN, please consider supporting your local farmers first by donating to the Double N Urban Farm tractor project. **",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Shareagenarians
is an online housemate service specifically for older adults.  We match adults over 60 who have more home than they need
or can afford with older adults who are looking for safe,
affordable housing.  Many of our
users are empty-nesters, widows or widowers, who may have an especially
difficult time adapting to life alone.</p>
<p><b>The Backstory </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438091455/do5wabf0irmnfkfv09nl.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;""/>
I’m Stephanie Heacox, Founder and CEO of Shareagenarians. When my mom was no longer
able to remain in her home of 50 years, my sisters and I wrestled with a
problem that you may have faced already – or that you may be anticipating as
your own loved ones age. Mom cherished her independence, and she wanted to
remain in her home, but it was no longer safe for her to live on her own. At
the time, I thought there ought to be an online service that helps elders in
this situation to find each other and create""Golden Girl"" households. There wasn’t. So as a longtime web and usability consultant – and third-generation do-it-yourselfer – I decided to form a team and build one. </p><p></p>

Shareagenarians
is an online housemate service specifically for older adults.  We match adults over 60 who have more home than they need
or can afford with older adults who are looking for safe,
affordable housing.  Many of our
users are empty-nesters, widows or widowers, who may have an especially
difficult time adapting to life alone.
The Backstory 

I’m Stephanie Heacox, Founder and CEO of Shareagenarians. When my mom was no longer
able to remain in her home of 50 years, my sisters and I wrestled with a
problem that you may have faced already – or that you may be anticipating as
your own loved ones age. Mom cherished her independence, and she wanted to
remain in her home, but it was no longer safe for her to live on her own. At
the time, I thought there ought to be an online service that helps elders in
this situation to find each other and create""Golden Girl"" households. There wasn’t. So as a longtime web and usability consultant – and third-generation do-it-yourselfer – I decided to form a team and build one. 
The Scope of the Problem




There were
12 and a half million Americans over the age of 65 living alone in 2012.  70% of those were women.  And people in this age group faced
foreclosure eight times more often than they had just 5 years earlier. According to AARP and Harvard, the high cost of housing can cause older adults to cut back on essentials such as food and medicine.Meanwhile,
scientists are documenting what most of us intuitively know:  living alone simply isn't good for us.  In a society where multigenerational
households are not the norm, the growing number of alone elders has social,
psychological, health and financial consequences.
Boomers Are Different
That said,
if one thing is clear about Boomers, it's that we're going to change the way we age.  More so than the generations that precede
us, we want to remain active and independent. 
Yet we are also keenly aware that we are social, familial creatures, and
we are willing to explore new ways of living in community, and of participating
in today's sharing economy.
Shareagenarians:  One Solution
One
potential solution for many homeowners and fixed income older adults is to share a

that already exist are mostly local, offline, or otherwise limited, and only meet a small percentage
of the existing need.  As a national
online matching service, Shareagenarians can reach the larger market and even
supplement local manually-operated programs.
Help us Provide Free Access and Support
So what do
we need?  In short, we need users.  Lots of them, and fast.  This is our biggest challenge, because if a user from Cleveland logs in looking for a housemate, we need other users from
Cleveland to be there, as well.  
To create
this critical mass as quickly as possible, we want to offer the service free of
charge for the first 30 to 60 days – longer for individual states where we haven’t

libraries, churches, senior centers and social service agencies.  We want to give them marketing materials and
user guides to support that outreach effort.

<p>Lexis Dilligard and Sharon Gonzalez are the mother daughter owners of Lady
Lexis Sweets Harlem's House of Confections.</p>
<p>We are seeking $18,000 for construction cost of a new storefront and to
support our efforts in providing free monthly baking classes to families which
would entail purchasing equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>My name is Lexis Dilligard and I am the owner and Pastry Chef of Lady Lexis
Sweets. While attending Baruch College for two years I decided to change my
major and attend Kingsborough Community College and study Culinary Arts. After
graduating I went on to City Tech to obtain a Bachelor's Degree in Hospitality
Management. While attending City Tech, I decided to pitch the idea to my mother
about opening up a Sweet Shop in Harlem. I raised some money, received some
help and with the help of my mother we opened the shop. While we are novice to
the baking arena there is nothing simple about our creations.  I am responsible for hand making all of the
Pastries, Cakes, &amp; Cookies in the shop and coining new creations that are
fan favorites like Smorkie Cookie, Rum Raisin Oatmeal Cookies and Chocolate
Chip Cranberry Cookie.</p>
<p>One of my goals was to provide my community with healthy choice for
desserts.  I created a line of Granola
and Vegan Treats for the Ralph Lauren Cancer Center located in Harlem, the
center has been a great supporter of our business.  </p>
<p>This year I spent time at The Community Health Academy of the Heights
providing free baking demos to the students who are being trained to create
healthy eating dishes.  </p>
<p>I also provide baking and cupcake decorating classes for children and as a
Certified Wilton Instructor I provide the community with cake decorating
classes. During my classes I show families how they can create fantastic
desserts that are free of artificial flavoring and preservatives.  We even provide weekly nutrient workshops at
our shop.  </p>
<p>As residents of Harlem it was a unanimous decision to open the Sweet Shop in
the same neighborhood where my mom and I were born and reared. We are vested in this neighborhood and it is
here in which we want to remain.  We need
help to remain in the community.  We have
no staff so it is just a mother and daughter team.  We love what we do; but we need more exposure
so that our daily revenue can increase and we can continue to accomplish our
goals; Showing families how to create healthy desserts and providing free
nutritional classes.  </p>
<p>We have put all of our savings into this business and we would like to
remain here.  We need $18,000.  The money will be used for construction of a
new storefront, to increase seating for the family baking classes and purchase
equipment for the classes  </p>
<p>The new storefront will open up our shop to more people and bring us more
foot traffic.  After a year and half at
this location we still have people who come inside and say, they didn’t even
know that we were here.  We want everyone
to know that we are here, and it is here that we would like to stay.  </p>

</div>
<p>In a few short weeks I will be launching my businesses showcasing my interpretation or I should say Abstract Realism in Nature and Beauty in Bold Body Contours and Apps creation for small business.</p>
<p>I started drawing and painting so that I could depict my conceptualised ideas of nature and form.  I love Picasso's Cubism  and Rembrandt's style and colour. Contemporary Art has always appealed to my senses but I have other talents and skills and hence have searched for a way to find balance between them. Even though I consider my art authentic, I by no means am an expert artist but a creative person who believes in the expression of self and ideas to one's best abilities.  I thought of the years I have spent pondering ""what if!?"" and decided it was time to take a leap of faith into the Creative Global Stream of Abstract Reality, to bring affordable original art to the masses.</p>
<p>My goal is to found Aundra Smith's Online Gallery in conjunction with my small business creative apps business<a href=""http://www.creativeloyaltyapps.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> www.creativeloyaltyapps.com</a><a href=""www.creativeloyaltyapps.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a>  because I love the balance between Art and Science, since everything stems from a creative core.  I have realised that in life we all possess a multiplicity of talents and defined skills (some with more talents than others) and all bestowed, is a Great Thing.  And because of this, one should live a life so full, that they empty themselves of all the talents and skills of which they possess, for the enjoyment and greater benefit of mankind, so that they leave empty one day, having lived for Live You Must!!!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order for me to do so I need to market my work both online and offline.  This is the first stage of my journey.  My Abstract Realism in Nature and Beauty in Bold Body Contours will showcase 8.3 x 11.7 (A4), 11.17 x 16.5 (A3),  10 x 14, 16x 20 and 23.5 x 23.5 (all dimensions quoted in inches) and all canvas using mediums: acrylyc, oil and ink.</p>
<p>To cover the cost for more canvas and paints, inks and brushes as well as to market my art and apps businesses the cost will be $750.00 to me. In order to do this though, I need your help funding this amount, and in return for helping me out, you can be one of the few who gets your hands on my original abstract creations and vouchers for apps to be created for your small business or someone that you may know who has a small business.</p><p><b>Here are some of my Perks to you:</b></p><p>These beautiful flowers are some of the perks to be had.  I really hope you like them as much as I enjoyed creating them. <br/><br/></p><p><b>The Blue Flower</b></p><p>Available in A4 and A3  and for your contribution of $35.00 and $40.00 respectively.  This painting is created in acrylic on canvas paper.  Be one of my unique collectors of these original paintings where no two are ever alike.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430739003/rcldr33jnxdcypimgwzs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>The Red  and Orange Flowers</b></p><p>These paintings were created on varying size canvas using acrylic, ink and oil paint.

I started drawing and painting so that I could depict my conceptualised ideas of nature and form.  I love Picasso's Cubism  and Rembrandt's style and colour. Contemporary Art has always appealed to my senses but I have other talents and skills and hence have searched for a way to find balance between them. Even though I consider my art authentic, I by no means am an expert artist but a creative person who believes in the expression of self and ideas to one's best abilities.  I thought of the years I have spent pondering ""what if!?"" and decided it was time to take a leap of faith into the Creative Global Stream of Abstract Reality, to bring affordable original art to the masses.
My goal is to found Aundra Smith's Online Gallery in conjunction with my small business creative apps business www.creativeloyaltyapps.com  because I love the balance between Art and Science, since everything stems from a creative core.  I have realised that in life we all possess a multiplicity of talents and defined skills (some with more talents than others) and all bestowed, is a Great Thing.  And because of this, one should live a life so full, that they empty themselves of all the talents and skills of which they possess, for the enjoyment and greater benefit of mankind, so that they leave empty one day, having lived for Live You Must!!!!

In order for me to do so I need to market my work both online and offline.  This is the first stage of my journey.  My Abstract Realism in Nature and Beauty in Bold Body Contours will showcase 8.3 x 11.7 (A4), 11.17 x 16.5 (A3),  10 x 14, 16x 20 and 23.5 x 23.5 (all dimensions quoted in inches) and all canvas using mediums: acrylyc, oil and ink.
To cover the cost for more canvas and paints, inks and brushes as well as to market my art and apps businesses the cost will be $750.00 to me. In order to do this though, I need your help funding this amount, and in return for helping me out, you can be one of the few who gets your hands on my original abstract creations and vouchers for apps to be created for your small business or someone that you may know who has a small business.Here are some of my Perks to you:These beautiful flowers are some of the perks to be had.  I really hope you like them as much as I enjoyed creating them. The Blue FlowerAvailable in A4 and A3  and for your contribution of $35.00 and $40.00 respectively.  This painting is created in acrylic on canvas paper.  Be one of my unique collectors of these original paintings where no two are ever alike.The Red  and Orange FlowersThese paintings were created on varying size canvas using acrylic, ink and oil paint. For your support of $50 and $65 respectively, these are my perks to you.Body Beautiful Contours My goal is to create more forms on larger canvas in continued bold and vibrant colours and some in perhaps 2 tones and textures.  The aim is to view the contour of the body in different perspectives from one painting as shown here.  For your support of $150 this is my perk to you.  Size 23.5 x 23.5 inches.MORE PERKS: Mobile Apps Vouchers for Android and iPhonesI decided to create apps because it is another form of creative.  Apps are tools used in the mobile revolution of today.  Every small business should have a Mobile Website and an App.  The reason being every where one turns, someone uses a mobile device be it young or old.  People live their lives today on the Go...Mobile. It is important to reach them where they are. Whilst a mobile website encourages one to stay in touch with what is on offer, a Mobile App helps with engagement.  Having a customer purchase online one time is one thing, but to keep them coming back for more is another, especially on slow days.  This is where mobile apps comes in and creates the magic.So for your contribution you will get the following:APP Perk 1 - for your contribution of $50.00 Voucher ($70.00 Value)I will create a 5 Tab App - Android Version Only.  This will be uploaded into Google Play under my developer account and will come with Push Notification Function for engagement - text only.  A Flyer will be created for your small business for the download of your app to be displayed in your store or a digital copy for your online social media marketing.  APP Perk 2 - for your contribution of $100.00 Voucher ($150.00 Value)I will create a 10 Tab App for your Android and Iphone.  Both of these apps will be uploaded into Google Play Apps and iTunes both under my developer accounts and will both come with Push Notification Function for engagement - text and html only.  A Flyer will be created for your small business for the download of your app to be displayed in your store or a digital copy for your online social media marketing.Includes 1 push notification.Sharing my FundraiserPlease, help me share Audra Smith and my Creative Apps with the world!

</p><p></p><p>In today’s economy, every penny and every dime counts. For many of us saving 10-20% is a welcoming offer. But stores and brands have put up a tremendous amount of hurdles and requirements just to save a few dollars. Coupons are difficult to save and keep track of, daily deal emails are usually for products that most of us don’t need, and loyalty cards make you check-in and earn points just to get a free cup of coffee. Getting a discount should be as easy breathing.<br/></p><p>If you don't use coupons, dislike daily deals, and rarely use loyalty cards then you're one of tens of millions of Americans who feel the same way. Even though the combined industry of all three is over $100 billion, all three industries have been in decline for years.</p><p>Some of the main reasons constantly cited by consumers as to why they don't use coupons, daily deals or loyalty cards is because coupons are difficult to organize and constantly expire, daily deals are usually product irrelevant to them, and loyalty cards require too much time and hassle just to earn a small reward.</p><p>wRipple, <a href=""http://www.mywripple.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mywripple.com</a> is a completely new way for people to save. wRipple allows users to share an offer that they receive from a merchant with their friends on social media. This sharing feature, gives our users the power to get a discount on anything that they are buying at any time. This on-demand discount is done without our users needing coupons, or a daily deal, or even a loyalty card. Our users just need our app and a willingness to share. </p><p>The reason that merchants are willing to give our users a substantial discount is because our users will allow them, via the wRipple software to auto-post a one-time first person message to their social media accounts that the user linked to wRipple. This message also includes an offer from that merchant that the user's friends and connections to use. If one of their friends ""likes"" or ""shares"" the post, then even more people can take advantage of the offer.</p><p>wRipple gives the merchant the ability to get directly in front of the audience that they covet most - the friends and connections of their existing customers </p><p>And we give our users the ability to save on-demand without the hassles of coupons, daily deals, or loyalty cards.</p><p>I designed wRipple for my wife.</p><p>When my wife found out she was pregnant with our first child, she decided that it was time to save more money. Raising a child especially living in New York was very expensive. And as any parent knows infants need a lot of diapers. My wife cut out as many coupons as she can. She saved every discount mailer from every national baby chain stores and downloaded every coupon app, daily deal app, and loyalty card that she could find.</p><p>But for some uncanny reason, every time she went to these national baby chain store, she would either forget the coupon or the coupon was expired. Coupon apps weren't very helpful since she could never find a coupon for a specific product when she actually needed it. And as much as my wife would have loved to get 75% off a massage, she didn't have the time and didn't want to pre-purchase a deal when she didn't even know what her plan was for the next day. Loyalty cards were not at all helpful. Especially since it takes an average of 9 months to get enough points to earn a reward.</p><p>I knew that there had to be a better way for people like my wife to save and get a discount without having to save a coupon, buy a daily deal, or earn points. I knew that there had to be a way to get a discount without all these hassles and jumping through all these hoops. I knew that there had to be a lot of other people out there who also didn't like coupons, no longer used daily deals, and don't use all the loyalty cards that they sign up for. </p><p>I conceptualized wRipple, <a href=""http://www.mywripple.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mywripple.com</a> for people like my wife. And I knew that I didn't have all the answers so I solicited three of my friends that had different areas of expertise to help be build it.</p><p>We sketched out the idea, poked holes through the business model and came up with a solution that simplified getting a discount for a consumer and simplified offering a discount through viral marketing for a merchant.</p><p>We believed that if we empower people with the ability to get a discount on-demand whenever they want, that they will in-turn pass along these offers to their friends. We believed that the power of our friends and connections linked together by social media can be the engine that drives our ability to save without ever having to cut out another coupon, or purchase another daily deal, or be required to ""check-in"" or earn points. </p><p>Since our approach was completely new and there are literally no companies that socialize offers and social media marketing the way we do, we wanted to be responsible for the initial huge risk. So, we put in our own money and sweat and tears to build the first app prototype.</p><p>Then nine months later wRipple was born. Our app is currently live and available in the Apple App store. <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wripple/id969586602?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wripple/id969586602?mt=8</a></p><p>We now need your help to make our prototype the norm in the world of shopping. We now need your help to simplify and transform the way we all can get a discount. We need your help to market - get new users, and bring on new merchants.</p><p>wRipple has the ability to transform the discount industries.</p><p>Our feature of on-demand socialized discounts without hassles is new to the discount industries.</p><p>And with just one post, a merchant has the ability to get in front of hundreds and potentially thousands of the most highly coveted and valuable lead base - the friends and connections of their existing customers.</p><p>Like other recently and highly successful companies (Uber and Snapchat, for example) have done, we're delivering significantly more value to our users and merchants by simplifying an industry. </p><p>While there are a lot of competitors out there from coupon companies, daily deal sites, and loyalty cards, we believe that the simplicity of our model can disrupt all three of these industries. All three of these industries are in a steady decline. Less than 1% of all coupons generated or printed are ever used and even though most people have close to 30 different loyalty cards, we use less than 1/3rd of them. And if you're one of the people, like my wife that no longer use coupons, daily deals, or loyalty cards then you know why. </p><p>We are looking to raise $500,000 in increase marketing, hire more sales people, and improve our app and even start work on the next generation.

For many of us saving 10-20% is a welcoming offer. But stores and brands have put up a tremendous amount of hurdles and requirements just to save a few dollars. Coupons are difficult to save and keep track of, daily deal emails are usually for products that most of us don’t need, and loyalty cards make you check-in and earn points just to get a free cup of coffee. Getting a discount should be as easy breathing.If you don't use coupons, dislike daily deals, and rarely use loyalty cards then you're one of tens of millions of Americans who feel the same way. Even though the combined industry of all three is over $100 billion, all three industries have been in decline for years.Some of the main reasons constantly cited by consumers as to why they don't use coupons, daily deals or loyalty cards is because coupons are difficult to organize and constantly expire, daily deals are usually product irrelevant to them, and loyalty cards require too much time and hassle just to earn a small reward.wRipple, www.mywripple.com is a completely new way for people to save. wRipple allows users to share an offer that they receive from a merchant with their friends on social media. This sharing feature, gives our users the power to get a discount on anything that they are buying at any time. This on-demand discount is done without our users needing coupons, or a daily deal, or even a loyalty card. Our users just need our app and a willingness to share. The reason that merchants are willing to give our users a substantial discount is because our users will allow them, via the wRipple software to auto-post a one-time first person message to their social media accounts that the user linked to wRipple. This message also includes an offer from that merchant that the user's friends and connections to use. If one of their friends ""likes"" or ""shares"" the post, then even more people can take advantage of the offer.wRipple gives the merchant the ability to get directly in front of the audience that they covet most - the friends and connections of their existing customers And we give our users the ability to save on-demand without the hassles of coupons, daily deals, or loyalty cards.I designed wRipple for my wife.When my wife found out she was pregnant with our first child, she decided that it was time to save more money. Raising a child especially living in New York was very expensive. And as any parent knows infants need a lot of diapers. My wife cut out as many coupons as she can. She saved every discount mailer from every national baby chain stores and downloaded every coupon app, daily deal app, and loyalty card that she could find.But for some uncanny reason, every time she went to these national baby chain store, she would either forget the coupon or the coupon was expired. Coupon apps weren't very helpful since she could never find a coupon for a specific product when she actually needed it. And as much as my wife would have loved to get 75% off a massage, she didn't have the time and didn't want to pre-purchase a deal when she didn't even know what her plan was for the next day. Loyalty cards were not at all helpful. Especially since it takes an average of 9 months to get enough points to earn a reward.I knew that there had to be a better way for people like my wife to save and get a discount without having to save a coupon, buy a daily deal, or earn points. I knew that there had to be a way to get a discount without all these hassles and jumping through all these hoops. I knew that there had to be a lot of other people out there who also didn't like coupons, no longer used daily deals, and don't use all the loyalty cards that they sign up for. I conceptualized wRipple, www.mywripple.com for people like my wife. And I knew that I didn't have all the answers so I solicited three of my friends that had different areas of expertise to help be build it.We sketched out the idea, poked holes through the business model and came up with a solution that simplified getting a discount for a consumer and simplified offering a discount through viral marketing for a merchant.We believed that if we empower people with the ability to get a discount on-demand whenever they want, that they will in-turn pass along these offers to their friends. We believed that the power of our friends and connections linked together by social media can be the engine that drives our ability to save without ever having to cut out another coupon, or purchase another daily deal, or be required to ""check-in"" or earn points. Since our approach was completely new and there are literally no companies that socialize offers and social media marketing the way we do, we wanted to be responsible for the initial huge risk. So, we put in our own money and sweat and tears to build the first app prototype.Then nine months later wRipple was born. Our app is currently live and available in the Apple App store. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wripple/id969586602?mt=8We now need your help to make our prototype the norm in the world of shopping. We now need your help to simplify and transform the way we all can get a discount. We need your help to market - get new users, and bring on new merchants.wRipple has the ability to transform the discount industries.Our feature of on-demand socialized discounts without hassles is new to the discount industries.And with just one post, a merchant has the ability to get in front of hundreds and potentially thousands of the most highly coveted and valuable lead base - the friends and connections of their existing customers.Like other recently and highly successful companies (Uber and Snapchat, for example) have done, we're delivering significantly more value to our users and merchants by simplifying an industry. While there are a lot of competitors out there from coupon companies, daily deal sites, and loyalty cards, we believe that the simplicity of our model can disrupt all three of these industries. All three of these industries are in a steady decline. Less than 1% of all coupons generated or printed are ever used and even though most people have close to 30 different loyalty cards, we use less than 1/3rd of them. And if you're one of the people, like my wife that no longer use coupons, daily deals, or loyalty cards then you know why. We are looking to raise $500,000 in increase marketing, hire more sales people, and improve our app and even start work on the next generation. We want to get wRipple to ever major and minor city in the U.S and eventually the world but we need your help. Once we reach our goal- 60% of the funds will go towards marketing and hiring sales people, 30% will go towards software development, and the remaining 10% for a rainy day. We believe that with your help, we can onboard over 100,000 new users and over 1,000 merchants. And when you help, you'll be part of our wRipple family.

I'm a young man of 19. It's June of 1989,  I'm wide-eyed and smiling from ear to ear in front of an itinerary of events. The activities include water skiing, hot air ballooning, sailing, camping, canoeing, and white water rafting. I begin to feel as if I have entered an extreme sports summer camp. I add my name to all these events and the fun begins. But I am not at an extreme summer camp. Instead, I have recently been admitted to Craig Hospital,  a rehab facility for individuals with spinal cord injuries and head trauma.</p><p>Only months before. It’s a dark night in October . The year is 1988. There are four young men. They’re 18. And there knocking back a few Budweiser’s. At midnight, one of boys has what he thinks is a brilliant idea. He says, let’s go visit Kevin at Stockton college. Freshman in search of a party. Yeah right! A brilliant idea. The passenger steps inside his dream car. It’s A white Nissan 300ZX Turbo. The driver jams his foot on the floor and the passenger is pinned back into his seat. It’s like a roller coaster. They are rocketing down the Highway at 120 miles an hour.</p><p>Because they’re teenagers, they're more thrilled than they are scared. 18-year-old geniuses. The driver slows at a toll. Once through, the passenger is once again thrown back into the seat. The passenger sits up, looks over his shoulder, and what do you think he sees? That’s right. Red white and blue police lights. What does the driver do? Slowdown? Pullover? No. That would make too much sense. He speeds up in an attempt to escape. He grabs the steering wheel and jerks it to exit the Highway. But they don’t. They don’t! The Turbo jumps a curb. It hit’s a small tree. The tree collapses. The Turbo flips over and since the passenger Charles is not wearing a seatbelt, He's ejected from the vehicle, thrown wildly through the air 100 feet. His neck breaks! He's hit with a permit spinal cord injury. Yes! I was the passenger on that tragic night.</p><p>The rehab process, from the time of my accident and through long years is long hard work, but gradually I come by answers. By the time I finish SCI rehab, I have a new awareness and new tools to deal with my life altering injury. Most importantly I now know that the glass is still more than half full.

<p>424 Gates Ave. <br/>Brooklyn, NY 11216</p>
<p><a href=""http://housing-art.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HOUSING</a> will open its doors September 23, 2017.<br/> </p>
<p>Historically speaking, there has been no room for the “other” in the euro-centric art canon. Major institutional collections in the US have widely excluded black artists for decades, despite the fact that without black artists there would be no modernism. Artists of color are widely expected to maintain a rhetoric that focuses on intersectional issues, while white artists are afforded the freedom to prioritize their own dialogue. </p>
<p>Because the ""other"" carries with it an overwhelming amount of weight, it is difficult, if not impossible, for marginalized artists to find the right languages to use, or the appropriate platforms to speak on. The problem here is that the margins are often where the most crucial work is being done. When the very systems for visibility are always already co-opted by White Supremacy, it is unsurprising that this whole terrain is difficult to navigate.</p>
<p><i>""Even the nominal inclusion of young Black artists in predominantly white institutional art spaces does not translate into substantive representation.</i>""<br/>— Olubukola Gbadegesin <br/> </p>
<h3>HOUSING is a place for art in the Bed-Stuy neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.</h3>
<p><br/>Part of our motivation is to support artistic practices &amp; aesthetic experiences that contour the limits of visibility, &amp; advance the conditional inclusion of artists of color.</p>
<p><strong>We are opening a six hundred square foot platform for discourse, for critical commentary, &amp; for the exhibition of some of the most crucial work that is being done. We are opening a space for some of the most discerning artwork rarely shown elsewhere. Our aim at HOUSING is not to promote the exhibition or collection of this work as a specialized initiative, &amp; it is not our aim to mitigate liberal guilt without the discomfort of actually challenging anything.</strong><br/><br/>With an impressive exhibition series, performances, lectures &amp; young artist workshops ahead, <a href=""http://housing-art.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HOUSING</a> requires the support of its community to offset the opening costs &amp; rental agreements. By providing any contribution to <a href=""http://housing-art.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HOUSING</a>, you are effectively funding the continuation of cultural programming in Bed-Stuy.</p>

424 Gates Ave. Brooklyn, NY 11216
HOUSING will open its doors September 23, 2017. 
Historically speaking, there has been no room for the “other” in the euro-centric art canon. Major institutional collections in the US have widely excluded black artists for decades, despite the fact that without black artists there would be no modernism. Artists of color are widely expected to maintain a rhetoric that focuses on intersectional issues, while white artists are afforded the freedom to prioritize their own dialogue. 
Because the ""other"" carries with it an overwhelming amount of weight, it is difficult, if not impossible, for marginalized artists to find the right languages to use, or the appropriate platforms to speak on. The problem here is that the margins are often where the most crucial work is being done. When the very systems for visibility are always already co-opted by White Supremacy, it is unsurprising that this whole terrain is difficult to navigate.
""Even the nominal inclusion of young Black artists in predominantly white institutional art spaces does not translate into substantive representation.""— Olubukola Gbadegesin  
HOUSING is a place for art in the Bed-Stuy neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.
Part of our motivation is to support artistic practices & aesthetic experiences that contour the limits of visibility, & advance the conditional inclusion of artists of color.
We are opening a six hundred square foot platform for discourse, for critical commentary, & for the exhibition of some of the most crucial work that is being done. We are opening a space for some of the most discerning artwork rarely shown elsewhere. Our aim at HOUSING is not to promote the exhibition or collection of this work as a specialized initiative, & it is not our aim to mitigate liberal guilt without the discomfort of actually challenging anything.With an impressive exhibition series, performances, lectures & young artist workshops ahead, HOUSING requires the support of its community to offset the opening costs & rental agreements. By providing any contribution to HOUSING, you are effectively funding the continuation of cultural programming in Bed-Stuy.
 


 

SUPPORT 
Your contributions will assist with the opening costs & operating supplies required to facilitate the unique program forthcoming at  HOUSING, including but not limited to:
signage; interior space refurbishment; the proper outfitting of a storage area for artworks; the purchase of a color/laser printer; general rental costs; electric & other utilities; the shipment & insurance of artworks; exhibition refreshments; artist & lecturer honorariums; the purchase of display equipment such as televisions/projectors for media works; 3-D printing; flight costs for artists &/or lecturers; community dinners; marketing materials & advertising costs;PA system rental & audio equipment for performances; the purchase of basic tools & hanging hardware; assistance with the fabrication of artist's works, continued payment for any & all freelancers, designers, producers, DJs, photographers or otherwise unlisted creative labor put into the space.
We are eternally grateful  for any amount of generosity you are able to show HOUSING, & promise to offer in return: 
an unprecedented exhibition platform for artists of color; affordable rental fees for various events & production purposes; a community gathering space; a number of purposeful HOUSING related products included herein; a performance series; young artist workshops & more.If we don't reach our entire goal, we are still fully committed to the production of an impressive exhibition series. Additional funds we receive beyond our goal will be instrumental to the realization of artists' works.

<p>In
Istanbul, Turkey this August, Alternative G20 will be hosting a summit on the
future of the Middle East. We will gather ordinary people, representatives from
NGOs and academics from all over the Middle East region to have their say on
the future of their region. The purpose of the summit is to debate and develop
real ideas for a better, peaceful Middle East. In other words: Allowing the
people who live there to shape their own futures.</p>
<p>We
have a team of organisers from various countries in the Middle East, including

Utilizing a 10 lesson curriculum that will culminate in several trips related to the performance arts, multi-culturalism and politics, and finally an end of semester talent showcase, it is our goal to foster a sense of empowerment and promote critical thinking and creativity to ensure that our youth are able to directly affect their futures and their communities in positive ways. The summer initiative aims to reach 40-50 NYC youth grades 6-12.Need Statement:The purpose of this program is to instill critical thinking skills, inspire and empower students of color and encourage them to excel in school while also honing their artistic skills effectively in a progressive and enriching environment. Most students, especially students of color, are guided down a path that either focuses heavily on academics, and stresses the importance of book smarts, or focuses on some sort of vocational skill that can ensure employment and a steady income. Either path leaves the student with little or no time or energy for creative endeavors with the exception of a few clubs or teams the school or community may offer in the afternoon or on weekends. Since we at YPOC understand the importance of allowing our children's creatvity to blossom, and it has been scientifically proven time and time again that children who are involved in extra curricular activities, especially those related to the performance arts, actually fare better academically than their peers without access to creativity enriching experiences, we aim to make academic achievement and creative forms of expression a dynamic duo rather than an odd couple. In a society full of youth who have access to a plethora of negativity in the form of reality television, an ever declining standard of music, the internet, and various other modes of transmitting negative depictions of people of color, our men, our women, our children and our communities, it is up to us as educators, parents, community members, family members and friends to lead by example and teach our children that not only are they capable of anything, but that they can actually achieve their dreams as individuals and as a people through awareness, empowerment, leadership and action. Whether they'd like to become a fashion designer or a neuroscientist we must instill in our youth a sense of self worth and agency so that they can take charge of their lives and make the most of the gifts they have been given. We must make them aware that their life itself, no matter how troubled they may be, is a gift, and that it is never too late to start over and be the best you can be.Goals and Objectives:The 3 primary goals of the YPOC summer initiative are:1. To instill a sense of empowerment in youth POC. Through enriching dialogue, experiences and examinations of self and society using pop culture, the performance arts, current events, history and other means of examining the role of POC in their own lives and as members of the Black Diaspora.2. To discover and hone each student's inate creative talents. Whether they are a singer or an architect, we aim to allow their creativity to flourish as their minds open to new ideas so that they are expanding their whole mind and not just their left brain. Through performance, deep reflective writing and creative seminars we aim to give students an opportunity to figure out what they like and realize their full potential in that area.3. To instill critically thinking minds. The main objective of the YPOC summer initiative is to make sure each and every student leaves the program with a questioning mind and a thirst for knowledge. As a community, we are often unaware of what isn't between the covers of a magazine or on the news, but a desire to know more about everything, and an understanding of the importance of concepts like empowerment and activism, will hopefully help create a generation of future thinkers, doers and leaders with the book smarts to know how to solve problems, the creativity it will take to defeat issues related to those problems and the empowerment to be the change they want to see in this world without fear.In addition to the main objectives, other significant objectives include improving students writing and public speaking abilities, improving their ability to learn in new ways and expanding their knowledge of history, society and themselves.Program Design:The YPOC summer initiative curriculum was created by YPOC founder Tajh Sutton. As a childhood education major at Brooklyn College with a concentration in English, a mother of two, a political activist, and an aspiring performance artist and model, my aim was to take all the things that have helped expand my understanding of life and added to my happiness, and put them together to create a holistic edu-cultural program that would benefit the collective. Future Goals:If successful in all goals, the YPOC summer initiative aims to branch out into an academic school year program, such as an elective or after school program option, in addition to the summer program. There is currently a senior staff of one, with an alternating list of volunteers providing assistance when needed. We are currently building support for sponsorship and partnering with like minded businesses, programs and initiatives for funding and implementation in order to hire a consistant staff and provide compensation as well as provide our students with enriching opportunities outside of their schools and communities.Excess funds raised will be stored in a YPOC account and used exclusively for YPOC initiatives, events & expansion including but not limited to the following:Equipment & crew to help create a promotional video as well as launch YPCTV & spread YPOC content & dialogueYPOC Freedom & Fun Summer Camp 2015 YPOC Summer Camp Farewell Student Showcase/ Exhibition/ GraduationYPOC Implimentation in public schools & community centers beginning Fall 2015YPOC Saturday Sessions (Ongoing according to demand)YPOC 2nd Annual Self Love Sessions (Black History Month 2016)YPOC 2nd Annual Mothers Day Brunch (May 2016)YPOC 2nd Annual Fathers Day Brunchv(June 2016)YPOC UnityFest Block Party Fundraiser (TBA)YPOC Parent Support Groupt (TBA)YPOC Community Potluck (TBA)Stipends for YPOC volunteersThe summer initiative is just one of many projects in a long line of endeavors to enrich our youth, our families, our communities and the world at large!Check out the photo gallery to see what we've been up to since our first indiegogo campaign in 2012 where we raised $1,100 and the YPOC journey began.

We can make this all happen in a bigger premises. 
Our chosen new shop is bigger. It has foot traffic. A quiet room for workshops and book club. Storage. Parking. Visibility. 
* We also need to 'curate' more - so we will be working with our suppling creatives to up their game. To try new things. To work on their business. 
This is all capacity building - and we are in negotiations with all sorts of professionals to make this work. This also fuels other small businesses and adds to their bottom line. 
* We need staff - so we are working with an agency on providing a training ground for people in the region so that we are a pathway to confidence and success. We will be looking at engaging them long term. 
Though - we need $$ to do this - so we need to build our business and our sales.
We need courage. And we have that in spades.

""Last Friday, on the day that his father was martyred as a result of his wounds, Ahmed woke up yelling 'they burned us... put the fire out... let me out'.""The hardest thing we face is when Ahmed asks about his mother. We try to change the subject and console him.'Rough days'Riham's mother, Satira, cannot hide her grief and worry.Riham's father, Hussein, tries to hide his sadness and anguish.""They were a loving and understanding family,"" said Hussein. ""Saad worked in construction while Riham worked as a math teacher. They lived a peaceful life until that terrorist attack burned them.""I heard a loud explosion while I was on the roof of my house. I was really worried when I saw it was near my daughter's house. I frantically drove there. Everyone was trying to help and put out the fire. I'll never forget that scene.""Hussein continued: ""Riham knew something had happened because she was awake for a while after arriving at the hospital until the sedative started to work. But she doesn't know the details of what happened to her family. She's been heavily sedated and unconscious ever since, and the doctors what to keep her like that due to the severity of her burns.""-BY al-Araby al-Jadeed (with some modification due to the mother's death)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>AJAX ADVENTURE CAMP</b></p>
<p>Ajax Adventure Camp aims to teach kids about their natural world through hands-on experiences. At Glassier, kids help raise chickens, ducks, rabbits, quail and in future years - other livestock.  The goal is for the kids to learn about agriculture, food sources, and sustainable practices in fun, creative, and explorative ways.  Furthermore, kids are exposed to other agricultural producer coop members so they can understand what it takes to grow crops on the land, how to use animals in the most sustainable fashion, and what it means to be a farmer.  <br/></p>
<p><b>COLORADO SOIL SYSTEMS, LLC</b></p>
<p>Colorado Soil Systems, LLC is a landscape management company whose mission is to act as a resource to the Roaring Fork Valley and surrounding area for information, education, and assistance in organic landscape management practices and soil building processes in order to grow our local food economy, increase environmental health, and increase resistance to disturbance in our food production systems and landscapes.</p>
<p><b>ELEVATED PRODUCE</b></p>
<p>Elevated Produce is a new company dedicated to growing locally and organically with the intention of selling these products to local vendors and residents of the Roaring Fork Valley.  We mainly focus on growing strawberries and we are currently experimenting with greens, vegetables and herbs. Although our operation is small we are currently cultivating part of the Glassier property in order expand strawberry production to meet our clients’ needs.  We look forward to building a relationship with local vendors, restaurants and the general public by selling at farmer’s markets and capitalizing on existing connections with small business owners in Snowmass Village and throughout the Valley.<br/></p>

<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>There are many reasons to support a co-op like Glassier Gardens.  When you support and buy from independent, locally owned businesses your money goes back in to your local community rather than to a nationally owned business.  Keeping business local also reduces environmental impact.  Locally owned businesses purchase more from other local businesses thus reducing the need for transportation and therefore contributing less to urban sprawl, congestion, and pollution.  Supporting local farms also preserves the environment by conserving open space.  Rather than developing the Glassier land for commercial use, Pitkin County decided to lease a portion of it to our co-operative for agricultural use.  Therefore, by supporting Glassier Gardens, you are doing something proactive to preserve the agricultural landscape.  When you buy local you are also investing in your community. Local businesses are owned by people who live in your community, are less likely to leave and care about your community's future.  </div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>THE GRASS</div>
<div>Although the Glassier property is historically known for having some of the richest soil in the valley, when we acquired the lease on our section of the property it had not been in agricultural use for quite some time.  Over the years local grasses have taken over and developed an extensive root system that is difficult to break through when tilling the land.  We would like to extend a special thanks and our deep gratitude to Brett Meredith, Rio Grande Trail Manager, for donating his time and effort and bringing a bobcat to help us break through the soil so that we may prepare it for planting.  </div>
<div>WATER</div>
<div>The Glassier land has excellent water rights and we have access to a water canal which we can dam at various points in order to flood irrigate our plants and flowers.  However, we need funding for an irrigation pump and pipe in order to best access and take advantage of this water supply.  Currently we are pumping water from a well on the property through several hoses to get water to our crops and flowers.  If we can get funding for an irrigation pump/pipe and rely less on on water from the well we can reduce our environmental impact on the water table and conserve groundwater.</div>
<div>THE WEATHER</div>
<div>High altitude gardening about 5,000 feet elevation has always proved challenging.  The heat from the searing sun during the day combined with unreliable rainfall and a short growing season can make production difficult in the Rocky Mountains.  If we can raise our goal of $10,000 (or more!) then we can set aside money for a greenhouse which would extend our growing season from early spring through late fall.  </div>
<div>ANIMALS</div>
<div>From prairie dogs to deer and even the occasional bear, our parcel of land on the Glassier Open Space land is home to abundant wildlife.  We seek to coexist with these animals but some have proved to be detrimental to our plants and flowers.  With every contribution we receive we will be one step closer to raising enough money to purchase an electric fence which will help protect our gardens from pests. </div>

Each contributor that adds money to our goal will get a signed price list and a thank you card, for people that give us more support well then we have to give you more from us, so if you're thinking of giving us £15 we will give you Hershey's GIANT Chocolate bar and if you want to give us £25 then you will receive a small sample box of  different sweets as a thank you.
If we do not reach our goal its not all sour apples! We will continue to make the website run and still send out those delicious boxes what ever we raise we know that you supported us.
The Impact

<h3>POURQUOI DEMANDER UN FINANCEMENT ?</h3>
<p>Les banquiers ne sont pas très coopératifs... et la société doit grandir.

<ul>
<li>Pour avancer, la société doit trouver un financement d'environ 195.000$ sur 3 ans ou au moins 65.000$ pour un an. Ces fonds seront consacrés entièrement à l'embauche de salariés à temps complet, à la recherche, l'acquisition et design de nouveaux produits.</li>
<li>Mais nous ne demandons pas de financement sans compensation. Chaque participant recevra une contrepartie, suivant la liste établie et dans la limite des stocks disponibles.</li>

<p>We created our company in order to begin training women and minorities through an extended cdl course.</p>
<p>My name is Jason Adams and I am the team leader.  I started my trucking 
career through the company sponsored cdl training with Beech Trucking in
 Little Rock for whom I began driving in the mid  90's.  To toot my own 
horn I was the only person in my class to pass the driving exam with a 
perfect score.  I went on to become a driver trainer with Beech later in
 my career.  I have also worked as a CDL trainer for Continental Express
 (now part of Celadon) also in Little Rock.  I
 left trucking in 2000 to work with a facility for troubled teens as a 
house parent.  I had direct authority for 10-14 boys for 5 years.  I came back to trucking in 2004 and currently drive for a company out of Grand Forks ND.<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>When you read almost any magazine or newsletter connected to the transport industry the two things you will see are that there is a driver shortage and that the driver retention rate for some companies is extremely high.  If you listen to the radio, like Road Dog radio on SiriousXM, you hear of the severe need for truck drivers, a need that is projected to grow over the next 10 years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447544425/uaxgc0t63m2p6lqtvpdw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The trucking industry has constantly and consistently ignored the large pool of unemployed and underemployed women in our nation.  I believe that most of them are unaware that they can do the job as well as anyone and that the conditions and equipment have improved to such a large degree that it's not the hard grueling job that it used to be.  To educate the public we will create a seminar and travel around to the unemployment and workforce centers and show women how they can become part of the transportation industry and make a good living using their cdl.  We are not about promises of riches or get rich quick schemes or the flashy upfront bonuses that other companies lure their students with.  We want to show our students that if they put in an honest days work they can get a honest days pay and support themselves and their families with a good paying job that they can be happy about and proud to do.<br/></p>
<p>We want to create a cdl training course that gives our students an extended training period where when they receive their cdl they can walk into any carrier, be assigned a truck, and take off with a load without the usual 2-6 week ride along.  We want to go beyond the basics and train women on how to protect themselves at their stops, how to find parking, how to deal with the unusual instances that arise, how to be safe, defensive, responsible drivers projecting professionalism for themselves, for their company, and for us as their trainer.</p>
<p>We believe that two week training courses set the students up to fail from the moment they begin.  Two weeks is barely enough time to learn the very basics of what is on a cdl test.  We want our students to have at least 30 hours of individual driving time with an instructor in addition to two weeks of cdl test prepration time along with time in-between to work on the practice yard going through the skills course.  Then if the student still feels unprepared we want to be able to eventually offer extended one-on-one time up to 12 additional weeks.</p>

<p>1.<span> 
</span><b><u>New improved website</u></b>- improved search engine, market fragmentation for
advertising &amp; placement, GPS enabling, innovations to draw reviews from
other apps: <b>$35,000 - $50,000</b>. The
website will be built to specifications.</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span><b>Mobile App</b> – App to capitalize on fact that 80-90% of yululate consumers are currently
accessing website on mobile phones. Cost: <b>$15,000
- $25,000</b></p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span><b>Advertising:</b> Main obstacle to scale so far has been limited reach of advertising.
Over 7 months we have identified best means to advertise – combination of
capturing captive business wi-fi customers, social media ads, events and other.

</span><b>Balance – </b>other operating costs such as staff salaries, rent, SEO expert,
utilities etc.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>There are 2 Kenyas. One built
for the tourists and one for the locals. The customer service experience one
can have in these 2 Kenyas is dramatically contrasting. Since majority of
tourist interactions take place at hotels, resorts and restaurants and there is
a public court to try businesses (Tripadvisor), the level of service at these
places is world class. However, on the flip side, since locals do not have a
consolidated platform to voice their views, businesses have gotten away with
treating consumers extremely poorly. </p>
<p>The biggest impact of Yululate
will be giving a voice to those consumers that have had to stay silent &amp;
suffer for very long, by harnessing the power of the mobile phone that majority
of them (30 million out of 44 million people have mobile phones in Kenya) now
use.  </p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>In addition to giving consumers a voice, Yululate will provide a medium
for the vast number of small businesses an avenue to economically reach wider
audiences and in order to scale their business, but more importantly it will
ensure that the best of these rise to the top through the public trial system.</p>

<p>When
business standards<span> begin

<p><b>Business Intelligence to level the playing field:</b> There is a growing movement of small and medium enterprises(""SME"") in Africa and they embrace the digital economy more liberally than their more established peers. However, established names cannot ignore their consumers who spend more time on digital devices. as a result, even though digital advertising spend constitutes a small amount of total advertising there is huge potential for growth. </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457082844/xmoxlwb7fetpkcejjumb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The big search engines however, are too complex and too expensive for

next-big thing on the investment horizon but instead of focusing on sectors or
companies we want to be the rising tide that will lift all boats by subjecting
African businesses to the public court and raising accountability and business
standards across the board. 
As a Contributor you will be the
catalyst to effect change across businesses in a region where legal and
regulatory changes are extremely slow and do not favour ordinary consumers.
Your contribution will not only have an impact on the daily digital lives of
African consumers but also provide an avenue that will give a voice to every
African with a mobile phone and access to the internet.





Our campaign is about harnessing
the power of the internet to empower every day Africans. We are committed to Africa
and African consumers and businesses by allowing them to voice their opinions on our website: www.yululate.com

Imran Khan, CFA is a CFA charter holder and former finance professional
having worked in New York for over 10 years in investment banking, consulting,
asset management & private equity. He co-founded Yululate with his wife
Tehmeena Manji. Imran is a graduate of Whittier College, California.

Tehmeena Manji is a co-founder
of Yululate. She worked in New York for over 5 years at Lehman Brothers as a
tax professional. She holds a Bachelor’s degree from CUNY Hunter College and a
Master’s degree from University of Edinburgh. 
   
Yululate is seeking to raise $250,000. The funds will be used
as follows:


1. 
New improved website- improved search engine, market fragmentation for
advertising & placement, GPS enabling, innovations to draw reviews from
other apps: $35,000 - $50,000. The
website will be built to specifications.
2. 
Mobile App – App to capitalize on fact that 80-90% of yululate consumers are currently
accessing website on mobile phones. Cost: $15,000
- $25,000
3. 
Advertising: Main obstacle to scale so far has been limited reach of advertising.
Over 7 months we have identified best means to advertise – combination of
capturing captive business wi-fi customers, social media ads, events and other.
Cost: $120,000 to $144,000
4. 
Business Development staff: Hire team of business development staff (10 – TEN)
across cities in Kenya. Cost $30,000 to
$40,000
5. 
Balance – other operating costs such as staff salaries, rent, SEO expert,
utilities etc.   The Impact 
There are 2 Kenyas. One built
for the tourists and one for the locals. The customer service experience one
can have in these 2 Kenyas is dramatically contrasting. Since majority of
tourist interactions take place at hotels, resorts and restaurants and there is
a public court to try businesses (Tripadvisor), the level of service at these
places is world class. However, on the flip side, since locals do not have a
consolidated platform to voice their views, businesses have gotten away with
treating consumers extremely poorly. 
The biggest impact of Yululate
will be giving a voice to those consumers that have had to stay silent &
suffer for very long, by harnessing the power of the mobile phone that majority
of them (30 million out of 44 million people have mobile phones in Kenya) now
use.  






In addition to giving consumers a voice, Yululate will provide a medium
for the vast number of small businesses an avenue to economically reach wider
audiences and in order to scale their business, but more importantly it will
ensure that the best of these rise to the top through the public trial system.




When
business standards begin
to rise and entrepreneurs are able to broaden their market reach, the impact
of Yululate in Kenya will be realized both socially and economically.

Business Intelligence to level the playing field: There is a growing movement of small and medium enterprises(""SME"") in Africa and they embrace the digital economy more liberally than their more established peers. However, established names cannot ignore their consumers who spend more time on digital devices. as a result, even though digital advertising spend constitutes a small amount of total advertising there is huge potential for growth. 



The big search engines however, are too complex and too expensive for
these SMEs to access and hence limit the growth of these SMEs. In Africa, these
international search giants are perpetuating the digital divide and instead of
being a means to connect more people are allowing the bigger, deep pocketed
companies to leave the SMEs behind. Yululate has been set up to allow these
SMEs to put in all their key words for an affordable price of $100 a year and
more importantly appear in search rankings based on their customer reviews not
based on how much money they have spent on us. Our Business Intelligence report will give information on what consumers are searching across categories, days/months etc. This will allow SMEs to compete
with other companies on their service offering for the first time but also give them vital and factual information on what consumers are looking for and allow them to target these consumers, thus,
leveling the playing field.

<h2>So What’s the Big Issue?</h2>
</div>
<p>This.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456450961/vjttpf8brw5to0cf5oct.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Sadly, oceans are the world’s sink drain. When civilization has a problem, we often like to scrub it off and swiftly flush it down the drain.<b> Eventually the drain backs up</b>. And the ""plumbers"" we hire to fix it are either <b>incompetent</b> or have a side business of <b>purposely clogging drains</b>.<br/>
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457718017/u0sedlyy263c03ztze54.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 561.885px;height: 373px;""/></p>

The massive problem with microbeads is their incredibly small size (most under 3mm). Once they leave your sink or shower they fly right through those industrial- grade filters at water treatment plants and <b>straight into our rivers and seas</b> (403 out of the 610 water treatment plants in New York State alone can't stop them!). According to a stunning 2015 study,<b> 8 trillion microbeads</b> enter our waterways <h4>
<b>EACH AND EVERY DAY</b>.</h4>

<p>Remember, these aren't natural ingredients -- they're <b>non-biodegradable plastic</b>.  Once these things get released into the wild, they never break down and they <b>never go away.</b><br/></p>

But it gets worse. Microbeads are <b>poison magnets,</b> too. They actually attract toxins <b>the same way magnets attract metal</b>.

</div></div>","Crush the Microbead Menace





See these? They’re microbeads. Those little bits of colored plastic are in hundreds of health, beauty and cleaning products. They're supposed to help with scrubbing. And now trillions of them are choking our waterways and killing marine life.

Hi. I'm Nawal Calder and I'm one of the owners of KINDERMA LLC, a small but pioneering skin care company in New England. We are deeply passionate about our work and we have dedicated ourselves to creating natural environmentally-safe products that make a real difference in people's lives. This microbead situation is a disaster. We're about to launch an amazing new skin care product that will help keep hundreds of millions of cosmetic-grade microbeads from being flushed into our lakes, rivers and seas. But we need your help. 

So What’s the Big Issue?

This.



Sadly, oceans are the world’s sink drain. When civilization has a problem, we often like to scrub it off and swiftly flush it down the drain. Eventually the drain backs up. And the ""plumbers"" we hire to fix it are either incompetent or have a side business of purposely clogging drains.



The massive problem with microbeads is their incredibly small size (most under 3mm). Once they leave your sink or shower they fly right through those industrial- grade filters at water treatment plants and straight into our rivers and seas (403 out of the 610 water treatment plants in New York State alone can't stop them!). According to a stunning 2015 study, 8 trillion microbeads enter our waterways 
EACH AND EVERY DAY.
- 2015  Microbeads Report, College of Science, OSU


Remember, these aren't natural ingredients -- they're non-biodegradable plastic.  Once these things get released into the wild, they never break down and they never go away.
Tweet: ""Microbeads are the ocean's version of disposable diapers"" #SaveTheSeas




But it gets worse. Microbeads are poison magnets, too. They actually attract toxins the same way magnets attract metal. Contaminates such as PCBs, DDT, fuel oils and solvents stick to the outer surface of these beads as they float through our waterways; waterways that are teeming with life.


And then the problem gets even bigger. Guess what a microbead looks like to a fish? Yup -- Lunch. Huge numbers of fish are now being found with chemical-laden plastics and microbeads in their stomachs.

If you're playing ahead, then you already know how this ends.









Hungry yet?




How is KINDERMA Different?


KINDERMA's campaign will make a real difference, because it will help all our efforts to put more microbead-free products on the shelves and force an earlier end to the microbead epidemic.The U.S.A. just passed important Anti-Microbead legislation. But it unfortunately allows companies to keep selling microbead-filled products until July of 2018. And trust us, many of them plan to.

KINDERMA (www.Kinderma.com)
 has fought against the proliferation of microbeads from day one. Our sole focus is on developing the highest quality and most naturally sustainable products possible for your skin.  
In fact, we got a tiny bit famous last year when the American TV show “The Doctors” recommended our high-end 
skin moisturizing lotion, DERMA RESCUE, for people who suffer from 
Psoriasis. 
Here’s the show clip:

Our flagship product, Hand Kind SCRUB, is a high performance hand and skin cleanser that removes concentrated dirt stains yet actually softens your skin the more you use it. Formulated with a powerful combination of natural humectants, premium moisturizers, and crushed walnut shells, Hand Kind SCRUB is equally as effective at removing grease, oil and toxins from your skin as it is at eliminating odors.But most importantly,
NONE of our products contain microbeads.

I believe that  foodies and restaurants, when unified,  have the power to help change the conversation around food.I started Food Tribe as a result of being frustrated with current restaurant review platforms.Restaurant reviews like these:""The risotto with scallops is where hope goes to die.""...andare really confusing and ultimately caused me to miss out on some good #eeeeeats based on the opinions of others.After some conversation with friends who were equally frustrated, I decided I wanted to combine my love of food, technology and giving back to start a company I believe can create community and honest feedback.Restaurant Reviews SuckFor Foodies: 16% of all restaurant reviews are fake, so for hungry eaters like you and me, that means a lot of wasted dollars.For Restaurants: 1 bad review = 30 lost customers! Crappy reviews are losing good restaurants potential customers.But Wait! There’s More!Social entrepreneurs everywhere are creating solutions to major problems and making them fun, which is how Food Tribe was born. I want to create a restaurant review platform that could provide a way for restaurants and their patrons to address LA's local hunger issue.Feeding the HungryOne in seven people in Los Angeles County experiences food insecurity.Food Insecurity = “the state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.”I believe that Los Angeles' exploding food scene—foodies and the restaurants they love—is the perfect group to address this problem.The Food Tribe#JoinTheTribe: With your help, Food Tribe  can develop a connected restaurant review platform + digital gift card program that rewards good reviews—reviews that push the food community forward and drive thoughtful conversation and change—and gives food to the needy.The Food Tribe will be the first restaurant review site with a cause.About the CampaignHere's how you can help: I've partnered with Santa Monica based gourmet cookie shop Cookie Good in order to raise the $8000 in order to design, build and launch The Food Tribe.

Under federal law, I can run for Congress or even become the President of the United States and have my finger on the nuclear trigger, but face a five year prison sentence if my finger were on the trigger of a Colt 45.To remedy this, I filed a federal class action lawsuit. As most of us know, litigation like this can be very expensive.  For this reason, I'm asking for your help to support my efforts to correct this injustice which affects my life and the lives of millions of others.  While it is true that each of us committed a serious offense, the offense was non-violent  and committed years ago.  We paid a dear price through the loss of personal liberty, however, once being released, we became law-abiding productive members of society.  Each of us has been law-abiding for at least five years.  There are some individuals in the Class who have been law-abiding in excess of 60 years!  After all of this time, aren't we entitled to the same rights and privileges as other law-abiding citizens?

Together, we have founded Lynx to offer high quality, professionally-guided experiences with an emphasis on linking the participants to the people and the environments around them. We understand what makes a safe and quality experience, and our focus on responsible business practices will set us apart from other guide services as well as do our part to improve our world.  
Through Lynx, we will show people great adventures in the varied natural areas of the northeast, and we will also work to protect them through educational programs, outreach, service work, community involvement, and responsible & sustainable business practices. We know that protecting the natural world and the integrity of our communities will not occur without first having a relationship with them. We are seeking your contribution so that we can foster these relationships.We need assistance obtaining initial capital costs: getting the equipment we need to offer these programs. We require $3,500 for climbing equipment (harnesses, helmets, shoes, hardware, and ropes); $400 for general outdoor gear (first aid kits, maps, and guide books); $1,800 for overnight camping equipment (tents, sleeping bags and pads, and cookware). Less sexy, but just as necessary, we need a $1,500 for insurance and $2,500 for marketing and advertising such as web-hosting fees, printed marketing materials, third party advertising fees, and loads of Lynx-branded merchandise (so everyone that sees your backer perk can have their own!).To say thank you, contributions earn you a gift certificate to our programs for double the contributed amount (up $1000) and some of our awesome Lynx merchandise. We've also partnered with local businesses to bring you additional perks: authentic Japanese ramen (www.misohungryramen.com), Vermont maple syrup products (www.wayeesesfarms.com), fair-trade, organically- grown, locally-roasted coffee (https://www.facebook.com/olddodgefarm), and local Vermont fraw honey (http://www.honeyhillfarmsvt.com).

This summer's operations will proceed regardless of us reaching our fundraising goal; your contributions will enable our inaugural year be a huge success. Keep an eye on our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/lynxguides/) and our News and Events page to follow us on our adventures (http://www.lynxmountainguides.com/#!news-events...) We greatly appreciate any help you are able to offer to us. If that can’t be monetary, there are other ways to help Lynx: share this with people you know would be interested; we are seeking clients as well as backers. You may have noticed gear is a big part of our need; if you have gear that we could use in the program, or that we could sell, please contact us to work out the perks of the trade.We started Lynx Mountain Guides of Vermont to help people experience and forge a connection to the landscapes, adventures, and cultures that Vermont and the surrounding states have to offer. Thank you for your interest, your contribution and spreading the word about this endeavor.  Sincerely,
Craig Cimmons & Nicholas Ruschmeyer",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Risks & Challenges


How will your crappy car make it all the way to Mongolia?  
I can't guarantee that our car will make it all the way. I hear teams do not make it all the way every year. All I can offer is the iron will to make it the whole way.

How will a scrawny desk jockey like you be able to pull this off?

The wood, the previous content, age, temperature, location in the warehouse... Everything makes a difference. Two casks of a distillery filled at the same time and sitting next to each other can taste different because the wood crafts its magic over the years in a subtly distinctive way. This is why bigger single malt brands marry casks in large vats so that the master blender can try to make the taste of the brand consistent.Chapter 7™, an award winning Swiss independent bottler, is the brainchild of Selim Evin. Selim was inspired by his Scottish grandfather’s passion
for whisky and created Chapter 7™ in 2014 .He was taught at an early age that casks (barrels) are not just vessels but they give the whisky its character and soul and thinks that each has its own unique story to tell. So Selim travels to Scotland and
Ireland to hand- select single casks from different distilleries. Then he
custom bottles each one with its own story. For Selim it’s more than a business, it‘s a passion.We are actively bottling selected single casks for our trade clients and our editions are recognised by whisky authorities like Jim Murray (Liquid Gold Award by Whisky Bible 2016). More info available on:  www.chapter7whisky.com
What makes us different?
Most independent
bottlers are after casks from much-sought distilleries. We act as a
spotlight for gems from lesser-known distilleries with exceptional quality and
character. Liquid Gold Award (94.5 Points) by Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible 2016 for Chapter 7™ Tormore Distillery 1995 Single Cask Bottling is a good example where Jim Murray expresses his surprise by quoting “Tormore...? Really....? I mean really...???”. Whisky Bible also rated our Allt-a Bhainne, Glenrothes and Glentauchers distillery editions with 91.5, 91 and 89.5 points respectively. Similarly, our Miltonduff Distillery 2008 cask bottled at 65.1% alcohol by vol. received a Silver Medal at C2C Cup in Germany.Some top distilleries don't want their distillery name mentioned on labels of independent bottlers to protect their trademarks. When we come across outstanding casks from those, we grab and bottle them respecting the brand owner's wishes. You can see the casks we have bottled to date on our website: www.chapter7whisky.com/casks 


  Product HighlightsWe mostly bottle single casks and occasionally we blend 2-3 casks from the same distillery that we think would marry well together for a good drinking experience.  Our whiskies are cask strength (between 50%-65% alcohol by volume). We don't chill-filter whiskies to keep all the elements of the whisky untouched. Single casks typically give  between 150 -600 bottles depending on cask type. Small batch editions are usually between 300 - 1300 bottles. Some of our casks are
from distilleries that don't have own distillery bottling hence are collectable. Each of our bottles are hand-numbered stating bottle number and batch total.

<p>My grandmother Leona had a small farm in Pocatello, Id for
many years. As the crops grew in and it became harvest time throughout the
years she would sell her bounty at the local farmers market in town to not only
the local people but to the restaurants as well. As a young adult working my
way up in the culinary world I had many opportunities to visit and work
alongside my grandmother learning the importance of small farms and what they
provided to small communities. This would play a big part in where my career
path would take me in the future.</p>
<p>I grew up in Virginia for a majority of my life before taking
a leap and moving to Washington. My studies in the culinary field started at
Johnson &amp; Wales University in Norfolk. From there I have spent the past 16
years working all aspects of the culinary world. Doing Fine/Upscale Dining in
places such as The Fat Canary and Prima Bistro; Bar/Steakhouse’s such as The
Grate Steak, The Taphouse Hampton, and Lonestar Steakhouse; and rounding out my

long with a menu that centered on global street foods and farm to truck
cuisine. The menu had items such as Cubans, Sliders, Butter Chicken, Chicken
Tikka Masala, and our take of street food brunch. We rounded out a great summer

after our little cart became unavailable to use anymore.</span></p>
<p>We are now looking at Petosa Roasta, which opened in the summer of 2015 selling killer BBQ. The owner has decided to sell off the Petosa Roasta, and we are jumping on the opportunity.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For the past couple months people have asked how they can get involved and help with the work Etter Consulting has been doing the families adopting and this is your chance! Through this crowdfunding campaign you can donate and or buy Etter Consulting apparel that helps us raise money to reach these three goals:</p>
<p>● Bring more adoptee focused events to Lancaster  <br/>● Get “When Your Family Doesn’t Look Like You” into potential Publishers hands<br/>● Help us get an official promo video made</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why These Goals? </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Bring more adoptee focused events to Lancaster.</strong><br/>Lancaster County has a large number of adoptees especially transracial adoptees, we hope to bring events that center around the adoptee experience. These event will also be educational for adoptive parents and parents considering adoption. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Get “When Your Family Doesn’t Look Like You” into potential Publishers hands</strong><br/>As many know founder of Etter Consulting, Isaac Etter, is writing a book on transracial adoption and his experience as a transracial adoptee. This campaign help us get his book into the hands of potential l publishers who could get the book into bookstores everywhere.  <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Help Etter Consulting get an official promo video made.</strong><br/>In the past couple weeks Etter Consulting has been asked to present at multiple conferences and adoption agencies on transracial adoption and our work in family preparation for transracial adoption. We beleive an official promo video will help us market our services to families, conferences, adoption agencies, and colleges. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over the last 9 months Etter Consulting has had the opportunity to share at several adoption agencies, work with many families, and even at present at Millersville University. Here are what some of the people have to say about their experience with Etter Consulting. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Isaac Etter is well versed and articulate on the subject matter of transracial adoption. Through his firsthand experience as a black child raised in a white family, Isaac is able to share his journey in a honest, direct and respectful manner. He speaks frankly about the identity issues with which many transracially adopted children struggle.

</div></div>","Short Summary
For the past couple months people have asked how they can get involved and help with the work Etter Consulting has been doing the families adopting and this is your chance! Through this crowdfunding campaign you can donate and or buy Etter Consulting apparel that helps us raise money to reach these three goals:
● Bring more adoptee focused events to Lancaster  ● Get “When Your Family Doesn’t Look Like You” into potential Publishers hands● Help us get an official promo video made

Why These Goals? 


Bring more adoptee focused events to Lancaster.Lancaster County has a large number of adoptees especially transracial adoptees, we hope to bring events that center around the adoptee experience. These event will also be educational for adoptive parents and parents considering adoption.  

Get “When Your Family Doesn’t Look Like You” into potential Publishers handsAs many know founder of Etter Consulting, Isaac Etter, is writing a book on transracial adoption and his experience as a transracial adoptee. This campaign help us get his book into the hands of potential l publishers who could get the book into bookstores everywhere.   

Help Etter Consulting get an official promo video made.In the past couple weeks Etter Consulting has been asked to present at multiple conferences and adoption agencies on transracial adoption and our work in family preparation for transracial adoption. We beleive an official promo video will help us market our services to families, conferences, adoption agencies, and colleges. 


The Impact
Over the last 9 months Etter Consulting has had the opportunity to share at several adoption agencies, work with many families, and even at present at Millersville University. Here are what some of the people have to say about their experience with Etter Consulting. 
 
""Isaac Etter is well versed and articulate on the subject matter of transracial adoption. Through his firsthand experience as a black child raised in a white family, Isaac is able to share his journey in a honest, direct and respectful manner. He speaks frankly about the identity issues with which many transracially adopted children struggle. Isaac also brings insight and a thoughtful perspective on a range of related transracial adoption issues.""
— Mark Unger, Regional Director- Bethany Christian Services
 
""We had the privilege of meeting Isaac during our foster care training with Bethany Christian Services. He shared his own adoption story with such transparency, authenticity, and vulnerability that made him immediately relatable. His openness to sharing his knowledge, wisdom, and life experience on the topic of transracial adoption makes him a great resource. He is incredibly helpful!""

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Churn Urban Creamery started as a pop-up in April 2016, owned by a husband and wife team.  Our focus was to provide farm fresh ice cream, a healthier/less sweet option, in our little renegade ice cream cart.</p>
<p>Along the way, we wanted to create and nurture relationships with different farmers so we could get our hands on the freshest and most delicious ingredients.  We even took the liberty of growing some of the ingredients in our humble backyard urban farm.</p>
<p>After popping up all over San Francisco and the Bay Area, working private events, farmers markets and festivals, we are needing a more permanent home.  We are now working on a brick and mortar location.  Contributions to our campaign will help us make the finish line.  And what a perfect neighborhood to bring farm fresh ice cream to, the Portola neighborhood, the Garden District of San Francisco.  And what a perfect space, one that was originally a 1920s sweets shop. </p>

<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>Churn is raising $21,000 to fund aspects of the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will be needing 11,000 for a new batch freezer.  This equipment is what freezes the liquid base and adds air to the product to make it ice cream.</li>
<li>We will be needing $8,000 to build a custom bar and stools for that old times soda jerk feel.</li>
<li>We will be needing $2,000 for a 16 flavor dipping cabinet, the type of display freezer you see at the ice cream parlors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reach Goal: $30,000.</p>
<p>Once we reach our initial goal of $21,000 we would like to achieve our reach goal of $30,000 to add in a convection oven to make our special ice cream mix ins, in house.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I'm Todd Burbo, founder of Harrison's. I've been part of Chicago's coffee scene for well over a decade, having represented Intelligentsia, Dark Matter, and Stumptown Coffee, among others. I've helped small business owners across the country build great spaces and serve great coffee.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548009253/i504azcllbomtfvk2dle.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking for a different challenge, I moved to Austin three years ago, but Chicago never left my mind- Just ask any Texan I've ever spoken to.</p>
<p>There were so many things to miss, but it was the neighborhood communities that brought me back. These pocket communities flourish in Chicago like in no other American city- That feeling of living among millions, yet knowing every face you pass on the sidewalk? That's uniquely Chicago.</p>

And as Harrison's, the space will incubate positive social change and the creativity of our neighbors!</p>

</div></div>","Who am I?
I'm Todd Burbo, founder of Harrison's. I've been part of Chicago's coffee scene for well over a decade, having represented Intelligentsia, Dark Matter, and Stumptown Coffee, among others. I've helped small business owners across the country build great spaces and serve great coffee.

 
Looking for a different challenge, I moved to Austin three years ago, but Chicago never left my mind- Just ask any Texan I've ever spoken to.
There were so many things to miss, but it was the neighborhood communities that brought me back. These pocket communities flourish in Chicago like in no other American city- That feeling of living among millions, yet knowing every face you pass on the sidewalk? That's uniquely Chicago.
 
 

What your contribution will create:


This campaign will allow me to do what I do best (give hot takes while serving coffee; surround myself with talented friends), while giving others a space to do whatever it is they do best. 

I'm asking for $15,000 to rehab the existing space and cafe equipment, as well as implement a new food menu. 
With the cafe operational, remaining funds will go toward amenities and equipment for communal use by registered clubs. This could be anything from music equipment to art supplies, and I will be taking requests from existing clubs in the future. 


 
The Impact
Aside from getting you a cool t-shirt or poster, your contribution will ensure that the Cup & Spoon space will remain a local, independently-owned business with longstanding ties to the neighborhood. And as Harrison's, the space will incubate positive social change and the creativity of our neighbors!

<p><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What happens when you visit a country and fall in love with the mountains, the oceans and the people?</strong></p>
<p>If it’s me, you decide to take a chance, change your life and use your life experience towards making a difference. That’s what happened to me in 2012 when I first visited Ecuador.<br/><br/>As an American, and a Latina, I couldn’t help but view my life through privilege as I became acquainted with a peaceful people with a rich culture and a diversity of customs in such a small country. Although this country may be rich in natural resources there is much poverty here too.<br/><br/>I was surprised to learn that the average wage in Ecuador in 2014 was $340 per month.  That wouldn’t get very far in the USA but here a family of five or more must survive even when work is scarce and infrequent. I was also surprised at how basic needs are often not met in some areas near our land.<br/><br/><b><i>I wondered how I could use my work to make a difference for a people I had come to appreciate and care for.</i>  </b></p>
<p>My profession for the last twenty years has been in the field of conscious leadership, inspiration and personal development.  <b><i>How could I apply my experience and skills to make a greater impact?</i></b><br/><br/>This question was the beginning of this idea called <strong><em>Oasis</em></strong> and my shift towards social entrepreneurship.<br/><br/><strong>Social Entrepreneurship | Social Impact</strong><br/>Social entrepreneurship is the attempt to draw upon business techniques to find solutions to social problems.  Through our Oasis project we provide economic support by generating jobs that shift families out of extreme poverty.  <br/><br/><b><i>We estimate that in the last four months here we have contributed about $20,000.00 to the local economy through employment, using local vendors and resources and buying locally sourced materials.  That is a huge impact in this area of fishermen and farmers.</i></b><br/></p>

<p><b>Our vision is that OASIS becomes a community of people from around the globe who value reflection, renewal and spirit as source for their greatest creative expression. OASIS is a place for those seeking a retreat, or a ""time in"",  from busyness and chaos. </b><br/><br/>Those coming to Oasis have the opportunity to amplify their own development by participating in our social programs (teaching English, tourism training, community gardens and more).  A percentage of our income will go to a fund specifically for community and cultural support so we can continue to support this community.

<b>Tito</b> is a maestro, an artisan with a mastery of traditional building skills.  Sometimes maestros concentrate only in construction or only bricklaying or only tiles.  Others have skills that are broader, like Tito. He is our “go to” maestro and he has been instrumental in helping us redesign our buildings to accommodate the environment here. He has an artist eye with a practical application.  Because of the work we provide he brings home a steady $600 month or more.<br/><br/>Our project is providing his family almost twice the average monthly Ecuadorian salary.  His children have new clothes for school and his wife has started a small food service business.  We had a wonderful time at his wife’s birthday party that was full of laughter. We brought two birthday cakes and fed about forty people that day that stopped by for a slice.<br/><br/><b style=""font-style: italic;""><img align=""none"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gallery.mailchimp.com/22db9aca17a110a880e42d737/images/fcb14bc9-b8fd-4998-8600-13d6c01568d4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></b><br/><strong style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"">Nicolas</strong><br/>Nicolas is our #2. He picks up where Tito leaves off. A quiet, diligent man he keeps mostly to himself and is tireless in his work.  We nicknamed him the “energizer bunny” because he would autograph his work with a bunny and because he never seems to tire.  Nicolas brings home $400 per month or more. He has used his money to finish building his house that up until now he could not complete because of lack of money. His quality life has greatly improved.<br/><br/><strong style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"">Victor</strong><br/>Victor is a master woodworker.  If it’s wood, he is working it. He built the strong front door, will be working all the floors and the bamboo ceiling, the large closets and more. His artisanry shows in his attention to design and detail. Victor brings his 11-year old son to work and it’s a pleasure seeing him teach his craft to his son.  Victor has earned about $4000 working on our project, which is like winning the lottery.<br/><br/>There are other workers and maestros we use based on the work needed. They are excited to be working with us not only because of the income but also because they are working on a project that also provides self-respect and pride for their work.<br/><br/><strong style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"">Anita and Blanquita</strong><br/>There are two women who live on each side of our property. Anita and Blanquita. Anita was living with no electricity or direct access to water. She would have to use buckets to bring the water up the hill. She has five daughters and works sporadically as a cook in a nearby hostel. Yet, she is always smiling and offers to help in many ways. She now does our laundry and brings us lunch to the construction site for us and for the other workers.  Her girls had stopped going to school because they needed to work. Now the two younger daughters are back in school with new school supplies.<br/><br/>Because our area is known to experience an occasional drought we built a large cistern and when we created the water flow plan to our buildings we included a pipe that runs water to Anita’s house and to Blanquita’s house so they would never be without water.<br/><br/>Blanquita is a single woman whose children are grown and gone. We could not build Oasis without her. She kept our supplies safe from thieves and the elements by allowing us to store them under her house. She comes in to sweep the dust every week. Recently she gave me a lovely hand made purse and hammock.  We have told her we would allow her to sell her artisan works at Oasis when we complete our project.<br/><br/>The two women earn about $50 a week or $200 a month from their work with us, which keeps them from extreme poverty. We have also shared our building supplies with them so that they can improve their homes. Their gift to us comes through goodwill and a daily smile.<br/><br/><strong style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://igg.me/at/oasisinecuador.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img align=""none"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gallery.mailchimp.com/22db9aca17a110a880e42d737/images/7edbc110-dba8-4565-882e-d67392e8d9d1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/>The Kids</strong><br/>I started my first English class this week.

<p></p>
<p>In 2012 I visited Ecuador because of a call of destiny. I was meant
to be there for an encounter with the ancestral wisdom of this country, to
learn about love and spirituality. Through Napo’s wisdom teachings I was
able to understand the marvels of the spiritual life. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our spiritual connection was immediately evident
and now we are guides and facilitators for those who come to visit us in Oasis.</span></p>
<p>After sharing our lives in Ecuador and USA we decided to
teach what we learned about our own encounter. We took our own experiences and
created wisdom teachings that would resolve life’s significant concerns.</p>
<p>Based in Love and Spirituality we are companions on life’s
journey with others that long for an encounter with the spiritual life. In
other words, they are ready for an encounter with Self that will transform bringing greater purpose and meaning into their lives.</p>

</div></div>","What happens when you visit a country and fall in love with the mountains, the oceans and the people?
If it’s me, you decide to take a chance, change your life and use your life experience towards making a difference. That’s what happened to me in 2012 when I first visited Ecuador.As an American, and a Latina, I couldn’t help but view my life through privilege as I became acquainted with a peaceful people with a rich culture and a diversity of customs in such a small country. Although this country may be rich in natural resources there is much poverty here too.I was surprised to learn that the average wage in Ecuador in 2014 was $340 per month.  That wouldn’t get very far in the USA but here a family of five or more must survive even when work is scarce and infrequent. I was also surprised at how basic needs are often not met in some areas near our land.I wondered how I could use my work to make a difference for a people I had come to appreciate and care for.  
My profession for the last twenty years has been in the field of conscious leadership, inspiration and personal development.  How could I apply my experience and skills to make a greater impact?This question was the beginning of this idea called Oasis and my shift towards social entrepreneurship.Social Entrepreneurship | Social ImpactSocial entrepreneurship is the attempt to draw upon business techniques to find solutions to social problems.  Through our Oasis project we provide economic support by generating jobs that shift families out of extreme poverty.  We estimate that in the last four months here we have contributed about $20,000.00 to the local economy through employment, using local vendors and resources and buying locally sourced materials.  That is a huge impact in this area of fishermen and farmers.



Get details on our vision and business plan HERE.
OASIS is a place to reconnect spiritually, emotionally, physically and intellectually to self and to others through community, what we in Ecuador call convivencia. 
Our vision is that OASIS becomes a community of people from around the globe who value reflection, renewal and spirit as source for their greatest creative expression. OASIS is a place for those seeking a retreat, or a ""time in"",  from busyness and chaos. Those coming to Oasis have the opportunity to amplify their own development by participating in our social programs (teaching English, tourism training, community gardens and more).  A percentage of our income will go to a fund specifically for community and cultural support so we can continue to support this community. We are committed to making a positive impact on our local community here in Ecuador. Every dollar that goes to our project directly affects someone here in our community by providing work and economic sustenance.
If you are someone who desires more from life and are open to engaging a deep inquiry with Self, open your heart and engage a conversation with life itself. Oasis is a place of peace and tranquility to practice opening yourself to Love. On ancestral land full of healing energy and with experienced guides you are held in a safe space.


Everyone needs this kind of place but there are too few places like this. Oasis in Ecuador is that place. 








We believe that it is our responsibility to contribute to the wellbeing of our neighbors.  

To meet some of the Ecuadorian people who are part of our community please watch this short video.  I want to share a bit of their lives with you and how our project is making a significant difference in their lives. 







Tito is a maestro, an artisan with a mastery of traditional building skills.  Sometimes maestros concentrate only in construction or only bricklaying or only tiles.  Others have skills that are broader, like Tito. He is our “go to” maestro and he has been instrumental in helping us redesign our buildings to accommodate the environment here. He has an artist eye with a practical application.  Because of the work we provide he brings home a steady $600 month or more.Our project is providing his family almost twice the average monthly Ecuadorian salary.  His children have new clothes for school and his wife has started a small food service business.  We had a wonderful time at his wife’s birthday party that was full of laughter. We brought two birthday cakes and fed about forty people that day that stopped by for a slice.NicolasNicolas is our #2. He picks up where Tito leaves off. A quiet, diligent man he keeps mostly to himself and is tireless in his work.  We nicknamed him the “energizer bunny” because he would autograph his work with a bunny and because he never seems to tire.  Nicolas brings home $400 per month or more. He has used his money to finish building his house that up until now he could not complete because of lack of money. His quality life has greatly improved.VictorVictor is a master woodworker.  If it’s wood, he is working it. He built the strong front door, will be working all the floors and the bamboo ceiling, the large closets and more. His artisanry shows in his attention to design and detail. Victor brings his 11-year old son to work and it’s a pleasure seeing him teach his craft to his son.  Victor has earned about $4000 working on our project, which is like winning the lottery.There are other workers and maestros we use based on the work needed. They are excited to be working with us not only because of the income but also because they are working on a project that also provides self-respect and pride for their work.Anita and BlanquitaThere are two women who live on each side of our property. Anita and Blanquita. Anita was living with no electricity or direct access to water. She would have to use buckets to bring the water up the hill. She has five daughters and works sporadically as a cook in a nearby hostel. Yet, she is always smiling and offers to help in many ways. She now does our laundry and brings us lunch to the construction site for us and for the other workers.  Her girls had stopped going to school because they needed to work. Now the two younger daughters are back in school with new school supplies.Because our area is known to experience an occasional drought we built a large cistern and when we created the water flow plan to our buildings we included a pipe that runs water to Anita’s house and to Blanquita’s house so they would never be without water.Blanquita is a single woman whose children are grown and gone. We could not build Oasis without her. She kept our supplies safe from thieves and the elements by allowing us to store them under her house. She comes in to sweep the dust every week. Recently she gave me a lovely hand made purse and hammock.  We have told her we would allow her to sell her artisan works at Oasis when we complete our project.The two women earn about $50 a week or $200 a month from their work with us, which keeps them from extreme poverty. We have also shared our building supplies with them so that they can improve their homes. Their gift to us comes through goodwill and a daily smile.The KidsI started my first English class this week. I managed to get a photo of our “classroom” but once the lesson was over, they scattered before I could get them into one photo. In July I’ll return with some lesson books and pencils and art supplies to continue our English classes.  These are some of the kids we have been able to help here and in other areas of Ecuador.


Every dollar that is contributed goes through OASIS to the community and its people. This is what we mean by building a community both locally and globally. 



Salango and the Rio Chico Community, the location of OASIS, is an ancient settlement located on the south coast of the province of Manabí. Archaeological findings show that spirituality and wisdom were interwoven with the environment with efforts to preserve the culture by transmitting spiritual knowledge through the generations.  Humpback whales migrate here during the months of June to September. These animals are symbolic for the people of the Manabí culture.


This is an area of farmers and fishermen, making their living from the land and sea. Life is pretty real and basic here. It teaches you to appreciate the little things and to see how simpler life can be without the fascination with material things.I’ve learned that I really don’t need a lot to live a happy and fulfilled life.  Coming here you may find that your perspective on your life changes too and you realign towards things that truly matter.




We have a heartfelt mission that is based on a practical business plan. Get details on our vision and business plan HERE.

Writers, artists, poets, musicians and photographers seeking a quiet place to reconnect with their muse come here.
Professionals who need to renew their energy and recalibrate their lives.
People who are looking for a place and guides to help them make important decisions in their lives will take the journey to find nourishment at Oasis.
Yogis, coaches and holistic health practitioners will find our space ideal for holding retreats to share their contemplative practices and wellness programs.
Women who are traveling alone and wish to safely enjoy a personal adventure and a encouraging community to explore a new country and culture and perhaps become involved in our local community service programs.
Groups – business or non-profit and socially conscious organizations – will come for the inspiration they find in the natural surroundings to develop conscious leadership to solve global challenges. Supported by our care and nourishment for the mind, heart, body and soul, teams will discover a deeper purpose for their work.

I'm Alicia Rodriguez and I'm an explorer, an entrepreneur, a storyteller, an author  and a mentor. In my ""day job"" I am a coach and advisor to executive women, visionary leaders and creative and social entrepreneurs.  In my private practice I work with my clients on Conscious Living  - thriving in work and life through intentional practices. My partner, Napo,  is a trained psychologist and an
Andean Wisdom Keeper in the Quitu Cara tradition. We both share this dream we
call Oasis. Why? Because people need to find their oasis, a place of sustenance
and peace for the soul, mind, and body.



In 2012 I visited Ecuador because of a call of destiny. I was meant
to be there for an encounter with the ancestral wisdom of this country, to
learn about love and spirituality. Through Napo’s wisdom teachings I was
able to understand the marvels of the spiritual life. Our spiritual connection was immediately evident
and now we are guides and facilitators for those who come to visit us in Oasis.
After sharing our lives in Ecuador and USA we decided to
teach what we learned about our own encounter. We took our own experiences and
created wisdom teachings that would resolve life’s significant concerns.
Based in Love and Spirituality we are companions on life’s
journey with others that long for an encounter with the spiritual life. In
other words, they are ready for an encounter with Self that will transform bringing greater purpose and meaning into their lives.

Now we want to make it possible for you and others to have your own life changing experience while we improve the lives of the people here in our community in Ecuador.



Right now we need $60,000.00 to build three casitas in the next nine months. With three casitas we can begin to generate income to help pay for more construction and to begin to develop our programs. All our workers are local, they are our neighbors. Our project provides work to many people in the Rio Chico community now.  We will be one of the major employers here so we will be able to contribute to the economic wellbeing of this area in the future as well.Phase Two will be the Main House and workshop and spa space. Phase Three will be the remaining casitas and more landscaping, the pool and a vehicle.CHECK OUT OUR ONCE IN A LIFETIME PERKS.  FROM PREPAYING YOUR VACATION TO LIFETIME MEMBERSHIPS TO A RAINFOREST ADVENTURE TO A VERY SPECIAL AND PERSONAL RETREAT FOR YOUR SOUL-SEARCHING TRANSFORMATION. SCROLL DOWN TO THE END OF THIS PAGE TO SEE DETAILS AND PICTURES OF OUR UNIQUE PERKS.We are committed and on our way. To date we have already received $30,000.00 in donations (just by sharing our vision) and have contributed thousands of our own to make this dream a reality. We estimate the total cost to build OASIS at about $450,000.00.  We are here to ask your HELP.  We would like to open by early 2017.



Each casita will cost $20,000 to build and furnish and the main house will cost about $150,000 to build and furnish. We will need $80,000 for a vehicle, $40,000 for a pool and pool area and about $30,000 for the landscaping, organic gardens and fruit trees and maintenance.  We have already paid for the land and built and paid for water, electricity and internet as well as a septic tank, water cistern and fencing. Any funding will go towards the immediate phase of constructions so we can become operational by Spring 2017.

SCROLL DOWN TO THE END OF THIS PAGE TO SEE DETAILS AND PICTURES OF OUR ONCE IN A LIFETIME PERKS.





Our greatest challenge
is funding.  We have already made a significant investment ourselves.  One advantage is that Napo is Ecuadorian and he
knows his way around the bureaucracy that can often causes delays. He is also
steward of hectares of family owned rainforest so he has experience in
agriculture and how to manage a large property. 

My background as an
entrepreneur and in the hospitality business combined with my organizational
background will help with the technological aspects of running OASIS and with
its marketing.  Having run several retreats together we know how to create
memorable and transformational experiences.  
Through our project you are also helping SUPPORT AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY  in Ecuador, to enhance their quality of life and feel empowered to grow and develop. Now and in the future. 
Because of our business experience we  teach local entrepreneurs better skills in working in tourism which is a major fountain of income in this area. We have already begun teaching English and sharing the world's cultures with the people here so they can understand better how to manage the burgeoning tourism business here without losing their own traditions.





You believe, like we do, that we all need a place to recover and renew, away from the chaos, so we can remain inspired and healthy in mind, body and soul.
You are committed in your own work to being a leader, to supporting others in reaching their potential.
You are interested in having a real, direct impact on people who need assistance in growing into a new world of computers, business and tourism in order to thrive in the future. Our presence here will directly affect the quality of life of the people here.
You know me and Napo and have worked with us and experienced how you can transform given the right support and guidance.
You want to be a part of a global community where you can feel at home while growing, learning and meeting other like minded people.
You have been looking for a place like this, where you can come and be taken care of, nurtured. Where you can find quiet spaces in your day to reflect or choose to go on an adventure in nature to a rainforest, to an island or simply a walk through our gardens.
You have wanted to visit Ecuador, a land of spirituality, mystery and beauty and this is your chance to do so in comfort and with friends.
You are planning a retreat for your group or a personal retreat for yourself in 2017.  This is an opportunity to commit at lower rates than will never be available again.



Not everyone has the discretionary income to contribute. We understand this. But there are other ways you can help that will MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.  When you receive mailings from us for our Indiegogo campaign please forward them to your friends and invite them to contribute and share. You are here because you care about being part of a community where the soul can find peace in a world of chaos. Your friends and community likely share your values around making a difference in people's lives.
Social media is important in getting the word out. For you social media savvy people, SHARE and POST on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and anywhere else about our campaign and let your readers know why Oasis matters. Use hashtag #oasisinecuador and @aliciarod.
Any bloggers out there? I'm available for interviews and to write guest posts for your blog in exchange for promotion and a link to our campaign.
Any travel bloggers or travel agents out there? I'd love to write about Ecuador and what it's like to travel through this beautiful country.
Any personal growth gurus out there? I'm available to speak or write on transformational travel as a way to find one's true nature.  I'd love to share my personal story - actually a kind of love story - about what brought me to Ecuador and how it changed my life.
Indiegogo has its own sharing tools.  Please use them.

We are looking for ""evangelists"" (Guy Kawasaki's word!) people who believe in our vision, to talk it up at your next social gathering or with friends or colleagues or with your yoga teacher and others who might be interested in bringing their retreats here. 
We welcome well wishes and good vibrations to keep us on our path!

In addition, a Foundation will be established for funding the consciousness-based projects identified at the Club's annual conferences of thought leaders as most valuable. The Foundation will be funded from the Club's profits and independent donations. 



 
Who's Behind the Project

I've spent more than 10 years in extended meditation, sold millions of dollars of consulting and training to Fortune 500 companies, and served as an executive or CEO in 15 businesses. I helped arrange 70% of the interviews for the book and movie phenomenon, ""The Secret"" and now I'm dedicated to making the vision for the Heaven on Earth Project a reality--with your help and participation.

I've put this photo of me with my wife and kids because they were the original inspiration for this project. This photo was taken with my Mom, 5 days before she passed away just a couple months ago. This project is dedicated to her and her memory. It wouldn't be possible without her.

Founding members receive lifetime membership benefits for themselves and up to 4 additional members of their family. Plus, their heirs will be able to continue to enjoy Club membership for 10 additional years after their death.

Corporate memberships provide five year's of membership benefits, but companies who enroll during our crowdfunding campaign will be able to receive deep discounts on Patron training courses starting in 2017, but the company's 5-year membership will not begin until the first Beyul Resort is open (scheduled for Spring, 2021). 
That means companies who join the Club now will be able to send their staff to Club courses for almost ten years in total! Corporate membership is $50,000 which amounts to about $2,000 per team member per year.

<p><i>The Dèmos community is proud to present Project Dèmos.</i></p>
<p>Project Dèmos (demos meaning people) is about freedom and empowerment through technology. We know there is a much more efficient way to communicate, organize, and co-create on a worldwide basis, and therefore believe the time has come to update societal organization to contemporary possibilities.</p>
<p><b>The Platform</b><br/></p>
<p>The Dèmos community works to create an all-encompassing, transparent, and user-friendly platform for efficient communication, cooperation, and co-creation. We strive to empower people to be able to contribute peacefully, and proactively to societal transformation, in the comfort of a safe online environment, with the look and feel of a game.</p>
<p>The Dèmos Platform combines communication and social networking, problem-solution management and co-creation, grassroots organization (which is natural and spontaneous bottom-up organization), upward control (which is the influence an individual has on public discourse), engagement characters, delegation, and economics into one single interface.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Method of Operation</b><br/></p>
<p>We keep track of, and discuss the latest technological solutions that contribute to individual empowerment and co-creation on our website (<a href=""http://www.projectdemos.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.projectdemos.net</a>), if possible, integrate them into the blueprints, and continuously update and share what we envision to be the most ideal Dèmos Platform.<br/></p>
<p>Alongside the creation of the Dèmos Platform, we produce a documentary detailing its blueprints, and potential political, cultural and socio-economic implications. We rely on donations and crowdfunding to finance the creation of a bèta and final platform.</p>
<p>The future Project Dèmos website, with its integrated forum and social network, is an environment for people committed to the project to efficiently and productively combine their efforts. By interacting and cooperating with similar initiatives, we build upon our collective strengths, as we build towards an open future.</p>
<p>We follow a ten step roadmap, focused on three general phases:<br/></p>

<p>(1) At first, we lay down the groundwork that will form the basis of the project, by presenting realistic possibilities and technological solutions that contribute to empowerment and co-creation.

<p>Hello, my name is Taeisha Black. As a Manager of more than 20 years with one of the most celebrated natural hair salons in the country, I feel it is my duty to carry on its legacy.  It is a legacy steeped in customer care that offers a nurturing, safe space for our clients to bond and beautify.  A solution centered salon for your hair care needs and desires.  This legacy now includes three generations. It allows us to have a positive and inspring space for our young daughters and sons to feel proud and confident in their natural tresses and the styling options offered to them. <br/><br/>While the doors have closed at Khamit Kinks, a door has opened for me to continue to grow and to hone my skills, not only as a Manager, but also as a Stylist, Stylist Coach, and Consultant. I can continue to practice my passion to beautify and serve. The name of my new salon will be Kinky Kollective.</p>
<p><strong>Your donations will allow me and my team to acquire a space where we can offer the best in styling and service.</strong></p>
<p>With your contributions, we will be able to take what we already have to the next level.  We will open a salon that will address not only your hair but other beauty services will be available to you under one roof ~ lashes, brows, facials, and other express beauty services to meet your needs.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $25,000.00. Your contributions will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two months deposit and the first month's rent</li>
<li>Build out of the salon space</li>
<li>Installation of shampoo bowls, wall dryers, and lighting</li>
<li>plumbing, electrical, painting</li>
<li>Installation of communication systems, phones, wifi,</li>
<li>We are offering perks that we look forward to sharing with you</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, funds received will go towards securing a new space.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>I enjoy serving others and thrived in my former work environment. There, I had the opportunity to meet and work with countless clients whose lives were transformed by the hair artistry offered at the salon.</p>
<p>It’s now possible to make my dream a reality. Our styling team will help to actualize my mission to continue training and coaching the next generation of stylists to treat, groom, and style healthy hair.</p>
<p>Our team and our clients are accustomed to an environment with a particular ambiance. We are currently sharing space in a salon that is not our own. While we’re grateful to be able to continue working, this temporary setting cannot accommodate the level of service we’re accustomed to providing. We must have our own salon space.  Your donations will help us to secure the type of salon space and environment we’ve come to be known for – a salon that is beautiful, welcoming, inspiring, and relaxing.</p>
<p>By backing this project you can be a part of helping to continue a legacy started by my mentor Anu Prestonia more than 40 years ago.  It was her mission to serve Black women and men while celebrating their value and the greatness of our people. You will be helping to keep a legacy alive, growing and thriving.</p>
<p>We need your help to meet this goal.  Please donate.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are some risks and challenges with this project.  Finding a large enough space that is affordable proves to be quite challenging in the New York real estate market. It is our desire to remain in downtown Brooklyn, but considering the cost of rents, we may have to consider other neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We have looked at dozens of spaces and we are certain of what will and won't work.  Over the years we have always worked from large and beautiful spaces.  With so many spaces on the market for rent, we are certain that we will find the right location.</p>

In fact, 70% of cats who enter a shelter do not make it out alive. Namastray is a cat rescue that will save cats and kittens from shelters who are considered at risk for euthanasia. Shelters can be very stressful for a homeless pet, and many are unable to thrive in that environment. This is our call to action.    Logistics:    Operating in the form of a lounge, Namastray will offer a relaxing environment to hang out with the adoptable cats. Our lounge will serve as a foster home while our team works to find placement for all of the cats in our care. A zen space free of cages allows guests to interact with the cats in a natural setting.    We will offer a variety of services such as yoga, meditation, sound baths, and workshops that will benefit the humans and felines.    Cats are a healing species, their purrs fluctuate between 20-140 Hz, a frequency range that is proven to be medically therapeutic. We are building a sanctuary dedicated to promoting healing and compassion, and it is only possible because of humans like you who are willing to give these cats a second chance at life.   Our goal is to help you achieve inner peace while providing the cats with socialization and stimulation. We bring our love of self-care and pet-care together in the hopes of building some “furever” friendships.

<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>Ben Waxman along with his fiance Whitney Reynolds, and parents Dory and Dan Waxman are the co-founders of American Roots. AR is a 100% American made textile company producing high quality Polartec fleece outer wear.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""> Mission is simple: ""</span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">“Our mission is to create good jobs in the United States, deliver a quality product, have a commitment to our community, our workers, and our country, and support a better more sustainable way of life.”</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>A little less than three years ago Ben returned from Washington DC and working for the AFL-CIO and in the political arena to his hometown of Portland, Maine. He came home to be close to his family, his friends from childhood, and the community and state he deeply loves.  His love of the labor movement and politics had not changed but his vision to leave a lasting mark in life had. He wanted to build something that created jobs in his hometown, and was part of the solution for changing the US and global economy.  Manufacturing was in his bones through his family.</p>
<p>After months of trying to determine what to build, Ben's mother Dory, owner of Old Port Wool &amp; Textile the sister company to American Roots, invited him to take a drive to her wool provider in Woonsocket Rhode Island. Dory had an idea for him to help grow a blanket line through his network.  So Ben and his fiancé Whitney Reynolds jumped in his Ford Explorer and headed south.  It was that hot July day standing on the floor of an old mill listening to the machines shake the walls that Ben looked at Whitney and said “we are gonna build a factory …and it’s gonna change the game.”  </p>
<p>Of course Ben finally came to realize that while he grew up hauling 100 pound rolls of wool for his mother and father with the family company Casco Bay Wool Works and now Old Port Wool and Textile,  it would be a partnership with Polartec of Lawrence Massachusetts, the leader in manufactured fleece  that would set in motion what has become the foundation of our company, our dream and now our reality.  American Roots was born.</p>
<p> With a newly trained, soon to be unionized workforce from the Old Port Wool and Textile training school, whose pride in their work and commitment is an inspiration to us all, we are ready to roll!</p>
<p>We are at a point where we have to get to the next level in our launch and that is why we need your help. On Wednesday, October 21st, our company American Roots will launch as will our capital campaign working with Indiegogo.  The money raised through our Indiegogo campaign will round out our ability to begin production.</p>
<p>My partner and love of my life Whitney Reynolds along with my parents Dan and Dory have made an incredible team. My love for my community, my country, and my belief that we can make things in America has never been stronger.</p>
<p>By contributing today you will help propel a company with the means to acquire orders to grow the production capacity, purchase in advance raw goods from Polartec and meet the pending orders of the fiscal year.</p>
