<h3>Monique Needs Your Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Dusan Palka and Monique Dream is the game I work on.</p>
<p>I like playing games and I also believe that working on the game is a kind of art. During my work on the first level I noticed that I love Monique and I want to prepare for her more and more adventures in the next levels. That's nice but...</p>
<p>I realised that without your help I can hardly finish her dream in good time and fully devout to her.</p>
<p>With your help and support, Monique can continue to fight for her life, solve all the puzzles on her journey and one day wake up from her long dream.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488267127/pi1flwyfzkmiowbwspzo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>So far all the work is made just by me. I was focused on animations, on her ability to interact with the world in the game and with her enemies. Monique can live her dream and actually be alive.</p>
<p>Next levels design of the game will be more attractive about a game environment. Monique will live her adventures in the caves or solve puzzles in abandoned buildings and that's a lot of work with textures and modelling in 3d software. Monique needs the team. There are two talented friends of mine that will join me and will be the full-time staff so that we can work as a good small developing studio and make the interesting environment happen. Finishing Monique Dream will take time and we want to fully devout to her. It means to work 8 hours minimum daily or more...</p>
<p>I know that if we want Monique to live her stories, finish the game in good time and keep quality of her fantasy dream world...then we can't keep other job. We have to work hard...and give Monique all our working time.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488268422/li1z2klhbvld4olvjyre.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>The Sound &amp; Our Original Soundtrack</h3>
<p>The sound is really important for us and we want the sound of Monique Dream Game to be excellent. I use a home recording software to make a working version of the sound and the voice of Monique for now. It's just a temporary solution.</p>
<p>Thanks to your contributions we will record all (voice of Monique, other sounds and our own music) in a professional recording studio.</p>
<p><strong>""The music in the game - the parts of my own songs""</strong></p>
<p>I've been playing the guitar for a long time - but there won't be only the guitar. In the part of our country called Bohemia and right in our town Straznice we have great musicians. They will join me on the CD of our music with their instruments. The CD will be full of nice songs - (not only parts specially adjusted for the game)</p>
<p>Music will be around 40 minutes long. See section ""REWARDS"".</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>When Will Be Our Game Finished ?</h3>
<p>We don't want to disappoint you.</p>
<p>Monique Dream Game will be a big full game with nice animations, puzzles and monsters or other creatures.</p>
<p>For me it means that there will be a minimum of ten levels in the game. Also, the time of your playing will not be under 8 hours.</p>
<p>We are hardworking and able to finish Monique Dream Game probably earlier but we want to avoid any disappointment that we can make to you by promising.</p>
<p>I feel we need one year and four months to be ready and bring an interesting game from us to the world of the games and to you.</p>

<h3>The Funds From You</h3>
<p>The funds from you will be used wisely and just for the purpose of making and finishing Monique Dream Game.</p>
<p>We have set our fundraising goal we need to reach and the time for completing the game. You may feel that it is a large sum we’re requesting to finish our game but this is actually the minimum for the full-time staff of 3 people and the game like Monique Dream.</p>
<p>This is a fixed funding campaign. If we don’t meet our fundraising goal, all contributions will be refunded. We can’t finish Monique Dream Game without the full amount and there’s no point in keeping the money if we don't reach it.</p>
<p>With your kind help we will finish the game and thanks to you we start to work as a small good studio that will be developing interesting games in the future as well.</p>

My name is Dusan Palka and Monique Dream is the game I work on.
I like playing games and I also believe that working on the game is a kind of art. During my work on the first level I noticed that I love Monique and I want to prepare for her more and more adventures in the next levels. That's nice but...
I realised that without your help I can hardly finish her dream in good time and fully devout to her.
With your help and support, Monique can continue to fight for her life, solve all the puzzles on her journey and one day wake up from her long dream.
""Torofly"" - one of the enemies that Monique meets in her dream.
 

Making Monique
So far all the work is made just by me. I was focused on animations, on her ability to interact with the world in the game and with her enemies. Monique can live her dream and actually be alive.
Next levels design of the game will be more attractive about a game environment. Monique will live her adventures in the caves or solve puzzles in abandoned buildings and that's a lot of work with textures and modelling in 3d software. Monique needs the team. There are two talented friends of mine that will join me and will be the full-time staff so that we can work as a good small developing studio and make the interesting environment happen. Finishing Monique Dream will take time and we want to fully devout to her. It means to work 8 hours minimum daily or more...

<h2><strong>3D Historical &amp; RPG Game.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>THORDERIA</strong> is a one-man strategy-intrigue-new world game. It offers to players an<br/>extraordinary experience with the world atmosphere supported by cinematic realism,.<br/>    You choose the limit of what can be done in Thorderia according to the fate you choose.<br/>The infrastructure of the game will present you different surprises in each new path chosen</p>
<p>and you will be able to take on unexpected roles!</p>
<p>What distinguishes Thorderia from its counterparts? Realistic atmosphere and roles you can</p>
<p>take in unlimited universes and more!</p>
<p>This is not a dice game or a game of chance! It's not a trip back to the end of the road! Go<br/>ahead and discover Thorderia! In Thorderia, the game starts with 3 different fates…</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588081799/yiwapddc3anh1pjaxoti.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>Choose Your Fate, Start Build Your Life!</strong></h2>
<p>    The general systematics of the Thorderia game is mainly based on living as an individual in<br/>the medieval world. This world is similar to the world with the high realism created, almost<br/>anything that can be done in the real world can be done without borders. It is the basic logic to<br/>establish an order and not to pursue a continuous goal, and to continue on our own goal.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588081851/u19gu671entbwtj31cwc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Just as life is the setbacks and games we encounter while we are making plans, life in<br/>Thorderia works just like this. When we are farmers, our harvest can be looted, we may be<br/>victims of intrigue in the palace, or we may suddenly lose our assets as a merchant. If it is the<br/>single biggest difference, we choose the identity we were born in the beginning!<br/>There is a huge empire to be discovered. Of course, this empire contains various mysteries<br/>and intrigues like everything else. You will learn this as the game progresses. After joining<br/>the game, you will choose your identity, and with the knowledge you acquire, you will gain</p>
<p>property, skills and power in your Thorderia life.</p>

Of course, no one said that terror is not a viable choice to get things done, just cover it with some propaganda. Not enough funds? Rob the bank or try to forge money.

Are we trying to bring freedom to our country by listening to the orders of someone else? So, in the game we are trying to replicate “how the real team would execute operation”. You are choosing who to send on missions, which equipment they will get but most importantly how to execute the mission. Each mission has 3 phases (preparation-action-aftermath). We have a map of the building, the visibility of action points/scenarios on which depends on how well we conducted the preparatory work for the mission. For each key point on the map you choose who to send and what to do (of course you must check if their personalities and skills suit the job), decide what to do on each stage and send your team to make history.

You must know and treat your people well, they are not just tools. Character Profile that reflects his individuality and views  Base management and characters’ interactions – By gaining popularity in the city and country, you will get followers; some of which may even join your team. Choose wisely which group will gain your favor because they will join you and if you reject them what will others think? You may group people in cells with various degrees of independence. You choose what they must do and how many resources they will get to achieve the goal that you set. But they may disobey you, change the goal and gather resources by themselves. Therefore, you must combine people in cells wisely and choose those you trust to lead, those who have enough willpower and the necessary skills to do it. Base Management Gameplay Mission types and preparation – It’s not easy to organize a demonstration. You must have enough supporters, enough money to feed everyone, influencers to entertain the mass but mostly the idea that will make everyone’s heart beat in unison. So, you must prepare. Get to know each corner of the country, gather compromising materials on enemies, make new contacts with people of the same beliefs, get international support and only then can you achieve something. Of course, no one said that terror is not a viable choice to get things done, just cover it with some propaganda. Not enough funds? Rob the bank or try to forge money. Is the Chief of police just on your tail? Kidnap his child and “make him an offer he can't refuse”. But of course, simple and short-sighted solutions like these mean consequences.Planning Phase – in real life no one will listen to your orders without doubts in their minds. Are we trying to bring freedom to our country by listening to the orders of someone else? So, in the game we are trying to replicate “how the real team would execute operation”. You are choosing who to send on missions, which equipment they will get but most importantly how to execute the mission. Each mission has 3 phases (preparation-action-aftermath). We have a map of the building, the visibility of action points/scenarios on which depends on how well we conducted the preparatory work for the mission. For each key point on the map you choose who to send and what to do (of course you must check if their personalities and skills suit the job), decide what to do on each stage and send your team to make history. Don’t worry if they need to ask you how to proceed, they will do it or they will decide on their own, yet again choose people wisely. Planning Board Gameplay Story:Setting - 15 years ago, the people raged a revolution for independence from the Shah, in which they won.  Democratic elections were held, then once more, but this time, democracy died. Because of certain decisions, the dictatorship of one family and the police regime was consolidated in the country. Not only has freedom abandoned the country, but your parents fell victim to that same revolution 15 years ago, when you were only 5 years old at the time. Since then, you are living with your uncle that also has a rich history of opposition activities. Yesterday you were expelled from university for excessive political activities and you decided that it’s time to change things. International Affairs  
Hijalla – It’s a middle eastern country, that has some oil, gas, little production and farms, but most importantly dictatorship and police that protect the oligarchs who exploit the corrupt system. Also beware of difficult relationships between neighbors and warring religious groups inside of the country.Deasima – A big metropolis, with everything you want from the poor residential areas of workers to luxury restaurants with cocaine paths.Nahzeir – A relatively poor region that feeds the whole country, as it is on the fertile soils of the river Firat.El-Balehir – An ancient and rich region that historically plays an important role in the economy of the East. Nahzeir, El-Balehir and Deasima cities respectively People:Badawi family (Nacer – President/Father/Older brother, Hafid – General/Younger Brother, Fathi – Air Chief Marshal/Older son, Hani – Minister of Economy/Younger son) the family of a dictator who seized all the major state structures who do not intent on giving power back to the people.Abidin Family (Derzel – Father, Ibtissem - Daughter) close friends of the President, you can say that Abidins’ are the purse of the ruling regime. They’ve got their hands in every big and profitable business running in the country.Elbaz family (Hakim – Supreme Judge/Father, Amira – Head of Huriya TV Network/Daughter) – Need to slander someone and throw them in jail? This is the right job for the Elbaz, the personal executioners and propagandists of the president.Al-Hameini family (Mahmoud – father, Wassim - son) is a dynasty that controls the seaport of El-Balehir. You can imagine the power of controlling main transportation and the economical hub, everything that comes in and out of the country passes Al-Hameini hands. Everyone in power is tied up  Art:We tried to achieve an art-style that transmits to the player the oppression and problems of the inhabitants of the country, but also conveys the hope and desire of change for the better.Music:Music is composed by ”Soundspring Studio”. You can hear it in all of our videos.Why CrowdFund:The game is in development for a year and a half. Currently, the game is 40% done. All of the game concepts and mechanics are finalised, the basic systems are coded and most of artwork is done. Till now, I was the only developer, but it’s time to expand the scale of production. However, this requires funding. We do not really want to turn to publishers because the game concerns sensitive topics and politics, so we need full creative freedom. If we don't get funded, the game will be released anyway but with less content.Budget Overview:RoadMap:January 2017 – Development StartedSeptember 2018 - Indiegogo CampaignNovember 2018 – Pre-Alpha DemoFebruary 2019 – Alpha DemoMay 2019 – Start of Beta TestingJuly 2019 – Polishing of the gameOctober 2019 – PC/Mac/Linux ReleaseFebruary 2020 – Xbox Release Free roads unlike our busy Roadmap Post Scriptum:We are very glad that you have read this far!

<p><strong>HoldOn</strong>! is a mobile game with a positive message: save people! The idea of the game came from a recurrent dream - what if all the people close to you were barely hanging on to the edge of a cliff? Who would you save first?</p>
<p>I'm a graphic designer, illustrator, and comics artist. I also do stand-up comedy in Romania, but I've always loved programming even though I have no formal training - I taught myself. I've made a lot of games and programs over the years, but very few were actually published.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Remember that recurrent dream I mentioned earlier? Well, since I couldn't get rid of it, I decided to be proactive and make a game based on it.  I couldn't do it all by myself, so about 2 years ago I convinced a bunch of friends and family to help me bring it to life. They all loved the idea and gave their time and talents for free. </p>
<p>Even though everyone had a full time paying job elsewhere and we only worked on the game in our spare time, the app we build up until now is way better than I imagined we could! </p>
<p>However, it is far from a finished or final game. We're calling it a proof of concept as well as a proof of our ability to create a game and work together.</p>

<p>In order to finish the game (in a reasonable timeframe), we need to be able to pay ourselves a salary. Most of the money we raise will go towards that, with a small percentage going to marketing the game prior to launch, developer fees &amp; QA services.</p>
<p>Also, because we don't want to release half a game and call it done, we won't move forward with the project unless we meet our goal - we want to be able to put in 100% and create an awesome app you can enjoy for a long time.</p>
<p>Here's a quick breakdown of our costs over the next <strong>12 months</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$9600</strong> for a programmer to work on adding all the features, optimize the game and work on all the publishing aspects, as well as support post-launch</li>
<li>
<strong>$8400</strong> - animation: characters, powerups, and backgrounds</li>
<li>
<strong>$9600</strong> - artwork: backgrounds and UI</li>
<li>
<strong>$6000</strong> - music: all the sound FX and custom music in the game</li>
<li>
<strong>$2400</strong> - project management: we need someone to organize the project, deadlines and campaing updates</li>
<li>
<strong>$1800</strong> - accounting: we need to have some sort of legal form to work, and an accountant to take care of all our taxes and paperwork</li>
<li>
<strong>$3000</strong> - marketing: someone to take care of social media for a few months around the launch date as well as a budget for ads and promotional things</li>
<li>
<strong>$11000</strong> - production of all the different perks (books, hoodies, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>That comes out to ~€73,000. On top of that, we need to take into account the Indiegogo fees. If we manage to secure our funding, we'll be able to work full time for a whole year and launch an awesome game!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What if we go beyond our goal?</h3>
<p>Well if we manage to secure at least $8000 over the goal, we will be able to afford renting a studio apartment so we could work together instead of each at our homes. This would definitely make things much easier and most likely shorten the delivery date!</p>

<p><strong>Space Outlaw Alice</strong> is a 2D retro game inspired by the clasics of the NES/Famicom console and the mecha anime genre. It is a game that puts together distinct <strong>platformer and horizontal shoot'em up segments</strong> and is powered by pixel art, chiptune music and rule of cool.</p>
<p>The game is a junction of several sciece fiction and space opera elements in a simple but interesting storyline. It comes close to the hardware specifications of the NES, but adds modern features like diagonal scrolling, widescreen and fewer graphic and sound limitations.</p>
<p>The story follows the titular character as she gets targeted by the corrupt government of the Earth Union and is forced to deal with mysterious extra-dimensional monsters. The player will mainly experience a classic platform action, but each stage also contains segments where Alice will pilot Seraph, her giant robot, and the game will shift to a horizontal scroller shooter.</p>
<p>Space Outlaw Alice is scheduled for a <strong>Q4 2019</strong> release.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Space Outlaw Alice's funding is set to a <strong>flexible $6000 goal</strong>. This is the ideal ammount needed for Hissatsu Studios to work on the game and release it within a reasonable time frame.

<p>This is the studio's first project. Its founder and currently sole member, Lucio de Godoy, can only work on his spare time.

Space Outlaw Alice is a 2D retro game inspired by the clasics of the NES/Famicom console and the mecha anime genre. It is a game that puts together distinct platformer and horizontal shoot'em up segments and is powered by pixel art, chiptune music and rule of cool.
The game is a junction of several sciece fiction and space opera elements in a simple but interesting storyline. It comes close to the hardware specifications of the NES, but adds modern features like diagonal scrolling, widescreen and fewer graphic and sound limitations.
The story follows the titular character as she gets targeted by the corrupt government of the Earth Union and is forced to deal with mysterious extra-dimensional monsters. The player will mainly experience a classic platform action, but each stage also contains segments where Alice will pilot Seraph, her giant robot, and the game will shift to a horizontal scroller shooter.
Space Outlaw Alice is scheduled for a Q4 2019 release.
 

 

Playing as Alice, action is in platformer format with (mostly) linear stages. Expect plenty of jumping, shooting, spikes, pits and explosions.
 

Alice will also battle using her giant robot Seraph. That's when the game shifts to a horizontal scroller shooter. More shooting, obstacles and tough bosses await!
 

All graphics inside the game are made with pixel art inspired by the NES color palette, which gave life to some quite charming sprites back in the day.
 


Speaking of charm, all tracks in the game are chiptunes inspired by the catchy music from the 8-bit classics.
 

The game will have 6 stages for you to advance through. Each has two parts, one on foot and the other piloting Seraph. You can also go back to already complete stages to look for items.
 

Alice can collect 5 extra weapons and some upgrades for health and ammo. Seraph also has collectable upgrades for its health and charged shot.
 


When things get really tough, you can expend your special attacks to cause extreme damage to regular enemies. They help against bosses too.
 


The storyline from Space Outlaw Alice is presented through pixel art cutscenes and dialogues. If those aren't your cup of tea, you can press start and skip them too!
 



Here is where things get real crazy. There are all kinds of enemies for you to face: soldiers, space outlaws, deadly robots and even monsters from another dimension!
 

 
Space Outlaw Alice is being developed with Clickteam Fusion and will be released for Windows PC. Release on other platforms will depend on technical and financial viability, a stretch goal being a possibility.
The game will be available on Steam Store when completed.
Minimum System Requirements

Players follow the life of a human being from birth to death by influencing important life decisions at every stage of development, and can add their own experiences to the story.
Experiencing different Lives - Story ModeThe player has no direct control over his life choices, but he/she can communicate with and influence the “inner dialogue” that makes up their character's emerging personality, represented as different, autonomous cursors. When you discover the right approach in interacting with them, you can ask them to “step aside” and let YOU make the choice – exercising free will. If they don't trust you, they might choose something you think is not a good idea, resulting in tragic consequences.The goal is to gradually raise the level of Consciousness points by developing a good relationship with your fractured sub-personalities, unlocking additional choices as well as Destiny points.  At the beginning of story mode you only have a very limited number of Destiny points, and you can spend them whenever you want to “force” your character's life into a direction YOU want, even if the character's caregivers or inner voices prefer something else.  At the end of your life you will lose all your Consciousness points, but you will keep the Destiny points, starting again as a baby. In this way you can lift up the quality of life for every person you play, but you can also see the dark side of life, witnessing tragic choices and suffering resulting from a lack of consciousness.
Psychology PuzzlesThe key game-mechanic in Story Mode are the conversations with your character's sub-personalities - making this game separate from all the other RPGs or life simulations. It resembles very closely how our brains actually work, trying to deal with trauma, adapting and creating an identity that fits into our social environment.​If you want to learn more about the concept of sub-personalities, I recommend this video. Exploring Consciousness - Free Will ModeIn this mode you have total control and consciousness over your all your life decisions independent from Destiny points, even as a small child. You can experiment with the freedom to see where life can go if it is all up to you for a change. Writing your own Story - Self-Authoring ModeThis feature is a “level editor”, allowing players to create their own story or expand the existing one with unique choices and inner dialogue that reflects their own personality. You can choose backgrounds and music that matches the mood of every new stage of life. You can create “mouse cursors” from 8 different archetypes that represent aspects of your character's personality - what they choose, what they would think and how they would respond in all the different moments of life that require a meaningful decision.  Creating a rich inner life offers a psychological puzzle for each moment, depending on nature and nurture, the developmental stage and the personality type - on YOU as the author. The challenge for players is to have empathy for each part and understanding for how it wants to help, even if what they suggest seems counterproductive.  The Meaning of Life - Project PhilosophyThe term “self-authoring” (exploring your past, present and future in written form) has been popularized by the success of Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. He speaks to a growing audience of people that are looking for purpose and are motivated to “sort themselves out”. ​ Inspired by his work, I created this game in the hope that it addresses the longing for meaning and awareness, as well as the curiosity, that even very young children already have: trying to figure out what life is all about in pretend play, asking questions such as:What is it like to grow up?How can you be a “good” person?What is it like to fall in love or have children?What is a breakup or divorce and why is it happening?What is addiction?Why do some people commit suicide?How does it feel like to be really old?How does it feel to die?What is it like to have a different skin color or grow up in the Middle East?What is it like to be a gay teenager? Or to have cancer?Or to be a millionaire?The main story of the game will offer a taste of what is possible - with only a limited number of choices, of course. The strength of this concept is the invitation to players from various backgrounds to contribute their own experiences. The authoring mode is kept very simple and easy to use, and the text limitation of 280 characters per moment (twice the size of a tweet) prevents people from becoming overwhelmed when reading or writing.  I want to offer a playful experience of self-knowledge – players are able to gain insight into their own and other people’s personalities and the inner dialogue that everybody has, but rarely ever shares - or is even aware of.  You can have fun experimenting with the “wrong” choices to see how life can take a radical nose-dive or how addiction cycles can keep you stuck, and you are able to figure out in a playful way, how your mind works, and with compassion for your own sub-personalities and their sometimes tragic strategies, you can overcome even the worst situations.When writing their own stories, players are encouraged to share their key life moments and the inner turmoil that they have been going through, promoting an anonymous creative outlet for experiences that are otherwise difficult to convey and getting acknowledgment and empathy over the in-game rating and commenting system.Self-Authoring is scientifically proven to improve academic performance, and journaling is well known to be essential for personal growth.

Building the setup feels just like in real life, where you grab your item &amp; place it anywhere in the room. You can also toggle free placement, which allows you to place anything anywhere.

We don’t want people creative ideas to be restricted when they build their computer. It works like in real life. You can boot your computer without having having all case parts equiped. This also gives you more freedom to fit larger parts in smaller cases. Cable management plays a large role when it comes to the final touch of a pc. So we made it possible to have an influence on the cable management by choosing specific point where curtain wires should go. We hope to see some crazy builds from you guys!</p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t stop here… We want you, the player to experience the computers performance, not only by vision, but also by hearing it.

In there i would build the gaming rooms of my dreams. I got the idea of making a game about creating theese rooms, but that quickly fell apart, since the onlyu thing i could codeback then, was a small game on scratch. 3 Years later i was taking my coding very serously &amp; 1 year later i started teaching programming.Back then I've had been working on multiple team projects &amp; that've teatched me a lesson or two. So now i finally felt like i was ready. So i hit up a  guy i've been working on projects with before &amp; told him about the idea. He loved it, so we immidietly planned out the game &amp; in november of 2019, the development begun. It didn't take long before the core systems of the gamer was working.</p><p>Weeks of everyday programming passed by...</p><p>Then in may 2020, Jon told me he couldn't continue on the project. This was due to some personal resons. I was pretty upset, but i didn't want to stop the development of my dream game. So with all my savings i hired Leo as a permanent artist &amp; the game quickly started looking much better. Then i hired a couple of different programmers to temporarely take over Jons role. Now the game started to look and work better than ever. Tho my savings where not big enough to continue for too long, especially because i quit my job for the project.</p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596282315/ld9c8u8ootgnio8id9oe.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>I'm paying for the entiere project out of my own pocket.

Unity is my sweet spot, i know it inside out. I even teach unity. This gives me a huge advantage in being quick and efficiant.</p><p>We've been working on the game for 10 months so far and that gives us a good perspective on what it will take to finish the entire picture. We've been working with many different influencers, so we have a good idea of which people we want, for when we complete the game. Last but not least, we've digged very far into what itr takes to make a good looking game which is still playable on low perfomance pc's. We stumped over the CTAA v2 antialiasing package, which makes the games light &amp; reflections look much better, especially when rbg lighting is such big part of this game. This asset can be turned of in the settings, for people with less powerfull computers.  Another asset that playes a big role in this game is Amplify Impostors.

Build any setup in anyway you want, with endless possibilities . With endless possibilities and multiple ways to achieve the result you desire. Here money is not a problem. Play the sandbox mode with unlimited money and unrestricted placement, or play the campaign, where you earn your own money and continuously progress, to achieve your ultimate setup. If you want to take your computer knowledge and creativity to the test, a challangemode is also an option. All of this, is a part of setup simulator. Since the game is still under development, we wouldn’t let your hunger torment you. So we made a free appetizer, allowing you to experience the concept in 2D, since there is no other substitute game out there. This is far from the real game and it doesn't have all the features as the real game, but it will give you an idea of what its like. We know that there are many limitations when it comes to building a setup. That’s exactly why we created setup simulator. We want to give you the freedom to build setup you’ve ever thought about. Here money and physics restrictions is no problem. We try our best to replicate real life, This means you can move around in the room & see your setup evolving up close. Building the setup feels just like in real life, where you grab your item & place it anywhere in the room. You can also toggle free placement, which allows you to place anything anywhere. We allow you to build your ultimate setup, with real life brands.Wires are the thing that many people often overlook, but we don’t. We implemented a simple system with 3 types of wires: USB, display port & power outlet. That perfect setup also needs a classy computer. We’ve made it possible to build your computer from the bottom. Bring each part to the computer & start building. We don’t want people creative ideas to be restricted when they build their computer. It works like in real life. You can boot your computer without having having all case parts equiped. This also gives you more freedom to fit larger parts in smaller cases. Cable management plays a large role when it comes to the final touch of a pc. So we made it possible to have an influence on the cable management by choosing specific point where curtain wires should go. We hope to see some crazy builds from you guys! It doesn’t stop here… We want you, the player to experience the computers performance, not only by vision, but also by hearing it. If you made a mistake you’ll quickly hear the computer struggling to complete task, but if you did well you can enjoy the silence of your sweet build. The sound of the computer depends on: airflow, fan quality and the parts in the computer. To effectively simulate computers performance, we implemented boot time, which depends on the computers power. When you boot your computer, you will start with only an internet browser. With this browser you can do a lot of things: 
Shop for items
Receive jobs & earn money
Download applications
 We have 4 applications to choose download. A software that lets you control the light in your setup. An overclocking software that let’s you max out your computers performance(be careful, you don’t want to toast your computer). A benchmark application, that can take your computer to the test. Not only can you benchmark test your computer, but you can also play a minigame, containing insights on your computer performance like fps and so on… Explore the 3 different gamemodes:
Sandbox - The gamemode with no restrictions or money limit
Campaign - Earn your way up to the top
Challenge - Compete in challenges
 Aproximately 5 years ago, i bought sims 4. In there i would build the gaming rooms of my dreams. I got the idea of making a game about creating theese rooms, but that quickly fell apart, since the onlyu thing i could codeback then, was a small game on scratch. 3 Years later i was taking my coding very serously & 1 year later i started teaching programming.Back then I've had been working on multiple team projects & that've teatched me a lesson or two. So now i finally felt like i was ready. So i hit up a  guy i've been working on projects with before & told him about the idea. He loved it, so we immidietly planned out the game & in november of 2019, the development begun. It didn't take long before the core systems of the gamer was working.Weeks of everyday programming passed by...Then in may 2020, Jon told me he couldn't continue on the project. This was due to some personal resons. I was pretty upset, but i didn't want to stop the development of my dream game. So with all my savings i hired Leo as a permanent artist & the game quickly started looking much better. Then i hired a couple of different programmers to temporarely take over Jons role. Now the game started to look and work better than ever. Tho my savings where not big enough to continue for too long, especially because i quit my job for the project. I'm paying for the entiere project out of my own pocket. But the salary for 1 permanant artist & 1-3 freelancers are not affordable on the long run, with this budget. This game requires a bigger budget to finsh. Without the help, we sadly can't afford to finish this game.But we building up a community, a community we believe in and that also believs in us. If you want the game to become reality, we strongly urge you to help us & become a part of the community from the beginning of the devlopment. You are the creators of setup simulator.  We understand that this game is a huge project and we are still far from done. We also want the game to look good, but at the same time also be playble on low performance pc's.This is not my first project, therefor i have a good feeling of what it will require & how we will work towards thew finished game. Unity is my sweet spot, i know it inside out. I even teach unity. This gives me a huge advantage in being quick and efficiant.We've been working on the game for 10 months so far and that gives us a good perspective on what it will take to finish the entire picture. We've been working with many different influencers, so we have a good idea of which people we want, for when we complete the game. Last but not least, we've digged very far into what itr takes to make a good looking game which is still playable on low perfomance pc's. We stumped over the CTAA v2 antialiasing package, which makes the games light & reflections look much better, especially when rbg lighting is such big part of this game. This asset can be turned of in the settings, for people with less powerfull computers.  Another asset that playes a big role in this game is Amplify Impostors. This asset allows us to have more high quility objects in the game, without using too much of the gpu. But in generel we are doing all we can to uptimze the games perfomance, so that all thoose advanced objects can be rendered in realtime while playing.But the bigfgest challange is to get the budget to pay the freelancers, so we can finish the game. Thats why we need you, to help us make this setup simulator a reality.    The backers edition of the 2D game, is kinda like a starter, taht you can enjoy while waiting for the main course(the real game). The 2D game is the concept game, but with much more features and many more items to build with. Learn More...   Thank you for viewing this our indiegogo campaign. We are very grateful for your interest and for taking the time to check us out!For those of you who cant afford back the project, there is another solution. Sharing our project with friends and family and social network would truly mean the world to us.

<p><u><strong>Quantum Fall Game Design Document Quick Sheet </strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Title: </strong></u></p>
<p>Quantum Fall </p>
<p><u><strong>Platform Releases: </strong></u></p>
<p>Oculus, HTC Vive, Valve VR, Xbox, PlayStation, PlayStation VR, Nintendo Switch, PC. </p>
<p><u><strong>Intro: </strong></u></p>
<p>A 50-year war has devastated Earth, during which a group of scientists has discovered quantum entanglement, allowing them to take the best humanity has to offer to a new world. A century has since passed on this new world, now called New Earth. The capital, New Phoenix, is home to the most technologically advanced systems humanity has ever created. The deeper understanding of Quantum Physics has allowed humanity to make great strides in clean energy, healthcare, and life. There is just one problem; a secret organization has brought it all crashing down with the destruction of the Quantum Core that powers the planet. This results in sending it into what is called a Quantum Fall, obliterating everything in existence and restoring Earth’s war torn timeline from 100 years ago. You are a temporal agent that was activated the moment the core breached. It is your job to piece together who was responsible and make a stop to it before it can happen again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Character Bios (Subject to change and more additions): </strong></u></p>
<p>Agent X: The main hero of the game (the player). His job is to find and solve the clues as to what happened to trigger the Quantum Fall and who is responsible for the attack. He has a personal Quantum Entanglement Device implanted by a government organization for this purpose. It will allow him to travel the timeline associated with each clue he solves to piece together the real culprit of the attack and prevent it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cosmos (Ai): Cosmos is the Quantum AI created when the scientists first settled New Earth. She is tasked with controlling and managing all the systems of New Phoenix with very little human oversight. Cosmos has studied all of human history to assist her with anything humanity needed. However, is Cosmos truly all that she seems?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Rough Plot: </strong></u></p>
<p>The game opens with a quote from a great 21 century physicist on black background,</p>
<p>“It is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century, the silliest is quantum theory. In fact, some say that the only thing that quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably correct.”<br/>― Michio Kaku, Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p>Fades in then pans across New Phoenix to a man looking out at the city from a window talking about the history of New Phoenix.</p>
<p>Agent X:</p>
<p>“New Phoenix the most technologically advanced city ever created. Powered by a Quantum Core that will never die providing clean energy for as long as it runs. A city of the future built from the ashes of Ear....”</p>
<p>Massive explosion and screen fades to bright white, then to Agent X waking up in a different place and time.</p>
<p>Game starts.</p>
<p>From the starting level, Agent X will need to solve puzzles and find clues to discover what has happened, all with the assistance of Cosmos, the Quantum AI that was created to help him.</p>
<p>Each level will consist of discovering a series of clues. These are presented in the form of exploring the different data terminals based on information gathered, data logs, and Quantum Trails left behind from the accident. These will present as puzzles and tasks to decipher the truth.</p>
<p>The end will present itself as an awakening moment when the last piece has been collected and all the information plays as flashback, revealing what happened and who was responsible for the destruction of the planet’s Quantum Core, at which point Agent X will have to solve the hardest puzzle of all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Artistic Feel: </strong></u></p>
<p>Quantum Fall will have a heavy Sci-Fi influence, much like cities in Star Trek, Star Wars, Cloud Atlas, and Fifth Element. The mechanics will be very similar to the older games of Myst and Riven, but with the added AI element and modern mechanics.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Colton Childrey. I am a passionate game developer in Los Angeles. I have over 8 years working on and in the game industry. I have taken on this new challenge of running my own studio working to bring games back to what they where; an emotional and engaging platform for storytelling. As a kid, I grew up playing games like Final Fantasy, Myst, and The Beast Within. These are games where players not only had an actual campaign to play, but also became emotionally involved with the characters, story, and worlds they were exploring. In today's games, it is all about the next battle royal or FPS. I say it is time to change that, but in VR, where players can have more of an immersive experience.  If you have read this far then GREAT, THANK YOU! As a contributor, you will help redefine VR games before they too get stuck in the FPS rut all other systems are in. Did I mention that you also get your name on the credits when it launches? Oh yes, it is just one of the many rewards you can receive for contributing to my campaign. Please look on for other rewards and perks.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now for the nitty gritty of why we are here (Ughhh! Right?)</p>
<p>We are trying to raise $50,000 for the project.</p>
<p>How we intend to spend the income:</p>
<ol>
<li>$5,000 will be spent to pay off the rent for the year on the office to reduce overhead.</li>
<li>$10,000 will go towards getting more computer and equipment for the other staff.(We are a small studio only 4 core developers.)</li>
<li>$5,000 will go to buying the last of the remaining software licenses. (Maya and Substance not cheap anymore WOW!)</li>
<li>$25,000 will go to paying the staff for expenses for the first year of the project. Staff do have sweat equity, so they are happy to work on their passion full time with little pay as we are all friends and coworkers trying to change reality.</li>
<li>$5,000 will be set aside for emergency funds, such as broken GPU, CPU, or any other event. (We tend to set fire to our GPU, the poor thing.)</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Perks</strong></h3>
<p>There are a limited number of each perk. We make more available if we see higher demand. The perks will take 6-8 weeks for delivery depending on location. Here is a brief list of perks available to contributors:</p>

<li>Pens</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully you are still there, we are at the end, I promise.</p>
<h3><strong>Back Up Plan</strong></h3>
<p>If in the event we don't reach the full amount, we will spend it on staff and equipment and move from there. Please, the more the better! Let’s make something great together!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With any development, there are always risks and setbacks.</p>
<p>We plan to always have at least 1 day a week to address any issues with equipment, hardware, software setbacks. We will be holding two meetings a week with the core team to share issues and concerns to address in the project. If in the event of some kind of disaster, we will also have a daily uploaded project file for remote access to prevent any interruption of the timeline for the project. All the core team will be well trained to take over another task in event of a staff emergency, death, or simply quitting. In addition, we will have emergency funds set aside for minor issues that will require just a little more cash to fix.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cant contribute, DON'T PANIC! You can always help by sharing this campaign on all social media platforms. We will give you a perk based on amount of shares and views your post are receiving, but only 1(one) perk will be given, so get those views on the post and re-shares. Once done, just email moreinfo@legiongamingstudios.com with an image of your post and how many views, shares, and re-shares or tweets it has.</p>

Quantum Fall Game Design Document Quick Sheet 
 
Title: 
Quantum Fall 
Platform Releases: 
Oculus, HTC Vive, Valve VR, Xbox, PlayStation, PlayStation VR, Nintendo Switch, PC. 
Intro: 
A 50-year war has devastated Earth, during which a group of scientists has discovered quantum entanglement, allowing them to take the best humanity has to offer to a new world. A century has since passed on this new world, now called New Earth. The capital, New Phoenix, is home to the most technologically advanced systems humanity has ever created. The deeper understanding of Quantum Physics has allowed humanity to make great strides in clean energy, healthcare, and life. There is just one problem; a secret organization has brought it all crashing down with the destruction of the Quantum Core that powers the planet. This results in sending it into what is called a Quantum Fall, obliterating everything in existence and restoring Earth’s war torn timeline from 100 years ago. You are a temporal agent that was activated the moment the core breached. It is your job to piece together who was responsible and make a stop to it before it can happen again.
 
Character Bios (Subject to change and more additions): 
Agent X: The main hero of the game (the player). His job is to find and solve the clues as to what happened to trigger the Quantum Fall and who is responsible for the attack. He has a personal Quantum Entanglement Device implanted by a government organization for this purpose.

Fades in then pans across New Phoenix to a man looking out at the city from a window talking about the history of New Phoenix.
Agent X:
“New Phoenix the most technologically advanced city ever created. Powered by a Quantum Core that will never die providing clean energy for as long as it runs. A city of the future built from the ashes of Ear....”
Massive explosion and screen fades to bright white, then to Agent X waking up in a different place and time.
Game starts.
From the starting level, Agent X will need to solve puzzles and find clues to discover what has happened, all with the assistance of Cosmos, the Quantum AI that was created to help him.
Each level will consist of discovering a series of clues. These are presented in the form of exploring the different data terminals based on information gathered, data logs, and Quantum Trails left behind from the accident. These will present as puzzles and tasks to decipher the truth.
The end will present itself as an awakening moment when the last piece has been collected and all the information plays as flashback, revealing what happened and who was responsible for the destruction of the planet’s Quantum Core, at which point Agent X will have to solve the hardest puzzle of all.
 
Artistic Feel: 
Quantum Fall will have a heavy Sci-Fi influence, much like cities in Star Trek, Star Wars, Cloud Atlas, and Fifth Element. The mechanics will be very similar to the older games of Myst and Riven, but with the added AI element and modern mechanics.

With any development, there are always risks and setbacks.
We plan to always have at least 1 day a week to address any issues with equipment, hardware, software setbacks. We will be holding two meetings a week with the core team to share issues and concerns to address in the project. If in the event of some kind of disaster, we will also have a daily uploaded project file for remote access to prevent any interruption of the timeline for the project. All the core team will be well trained to take over another task in event of a staff emergency, death, or simply quitting. In addition, we will have emergency funds set aside for minor issues that will require just a little more cash to fix.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you cant contribute, DON'T PANIC! You can always help by sharing this campaign on all social media platforms. We will give you a perk based on amount of shares and views your post are receiving, but only 1(one) perk will be given, so get those views on the post and re-shares. Once done, just email moreinfo@legiongamingstudios.com with an image of your post and how many views, shares, and re-shares or tweets it has.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The idea for our game hit us in November last year. I've created a game that is supposed to inform how we can help people who desperatly need our support. Under the eyelids is a charity mobile game, in which the heroes are children. In this game the fate of heroes depends on us.  Throughout the work we’ve been inspired by the desire to help others. Poor children were what motivated us when we created  “Under the Eyelids” Every lvl tells another story, in every lvl we can help people who have different problems.  We want to make a mobile game that will allow to show problems from all over the world. Our motto here is: Each of us can help!  Under the Eyelids will be game of physical skill in which the character is a young child. Climatic, black and white graphic, the best soundtrack and interesting stories, it is our highest priority.Our target group is young people aged between 16 to 30. They mostly use phones for gaming.It's very important that the game will have multi-stage levels.Do you know what happens every day in the world? Let me explain it to you It's 21st century, we have telephones, electric cars, nuclear power, but every 5 seconds a child dies of starvation and lack of water. 
 
                                                        

 
The construction of one well in Africa costs $ 3,500, but every day in the world people buy 700 million bars of chocolate… On average a bar of chocolate costs $1, multiply it 700 million times. For that sum we can build 200 thousand wells, which are really needed there, or provide 12 months of education, medication and food for 2 million children. I would like to present this problem on the first level of the game.When we created Under the Eyelids we felt that it is not enough for us. Not every person would like to have a mobile game, so we came up with an idea. We must make an official website Under the Eyelids where news, updates, upgrades will be published and this will be our way to help children all over the world. During this project we also wanted to find out what kids know about children in Africa.                                                       
Together we painted pictures for children in Africa. This was a really great fun and it let us see our project through children’s eyes.We are going to send our pictures for children in Africa.www.undertheeyelids.pe.hu I have created all levels with children on my mind. I want to make a mobile game that will allow to show problems from all over the world. Our motto here is: The second level will be about children which live in war. Our mission is to collect money for them. I strongly believe that we can help, but it isn't easy to do. Armed conflict is a reality for millions of children.                                                       
Do you know that 50 million of them flee from worm! Under the Eyelids is committed to supporting these children. The same like in the first level (Africa-the lack of water) player after the game will have the option to donate money to a good cause.  I`ve a lot of ideas for Under the Eyelids, but i need money for realizations of it. I`am going to spend money on :

<p>So far we have completed well over half of the art required for the cards (which is the most time consuming part) as well as extensive player testing over the last 8 or so months.

And for those fans of bling decks, there will be foil versions of most of the cards in the set too!<br/></p>

the fans and backers by providing weekly updates each week.
 This will come via a Status update on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/EtherTCG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a> and update here

<h3>WHERE IS MY MONEY GOING?</h3>
<p>Your pledge dollars
 go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you.  
We have invested in getting the project to this point where it's ready, 
your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make 
the games - the most costly part of game production.  </p>
<p>- Creating the products

</p>
<p>- Taxes for importing the products</p>
<p>- Pay for our websites hosting</p>
<p>- Hardware</p>
<p>- Promotion 
</p>
<p>- Commission Work</p>
<p>- Secure Storage of Product</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES<br/>
</h3>
<p>All designs are still subject/likely to change. Images shown here are of the final art - however while it 
is not expected, changes may be made before final production both to the 
art work and game contents.  Variations in the production process and 
monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to 
what appears in physical form.<br/><br/>As we are relying on another company to create our product delays may occur. The estimated shipping time we  provided, is based on the estimated production times, plus some. It's our goal to get it out before the estimated dates!<br/></p>Have an issue? Send us a message. Nothing 
would make us happier than having 100% of our supporters be 100% 
satisfied with their pledge rewards! You can contact us through indiegogo, our website or jump on over to our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/EtherTCG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a>, where you can discuss the game with other community members and us! <br/><br/>View our website and browse our <a href=""http://www.ethertcg.com/#!card-database/c1rgq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">card database</a> which is being updated throughout this campaign! <a href=""http://www.ethertcg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ethertcg.com</a> <br/><br/><p><br/></p> <br/><br/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


All our products being produced are of the best quality and come in professionally designed custom packaging. Our trading cards are being printed on thick 300gsm stock, our boxes are sturdy and made to be reusable, with  plastic insert trays designed to hold your cards while you are not playing with them.The campaign will be the only time that these
 cards will be available in 1st edition. In the future the more popular 
cards and cards that may need a buff/nerf (stuff happens!) as they were not working as 
originally intended, may get re-released and therefore not be 1st 
edition any more.
SHIPPING INFO (Important!)


Once the product is ready to ship we will send each one of you a paypal invoice with combined shipping cost,  This is so we can be fair to everyone by charging you the exact shipping  rate. This also means that if stretch goals get met, instead of getting charged twice for shipping you will just get charged the one price.

After some time however,there were power struggles in the leadership and a subsequent attempted coup that divided the knightly order into two fractions.Which, despite the ensuing peace negotiations, turned into a violent war.This is only a short summary, you can discover the full history in-game if you are interested. In the future we plan to bring more content based on the lore, new content should be chosen democratically by the community. Most wanted content has top priority for us.Players can join one of these factions as a knight in order to gain dominion over Vall Tir in epic multiplayer/singleplayer battles.Each fraction has its own history, culture and religion, which is reflected in the style of play, music and general ambience.Play your way up in their ranks with friends or alone, unlock new skins, achievements, etc.(more on this in the future)Every time you spawn, you play a new life, because by death you lose all items and the ingame level progression.But if you manage to recover your treasure before an opponent has done it, you lose nothing.General account level, unlocked content, achievements, etc. should be spared from death.Graphic violence (18+): The time in which the RKO plays is characterized by violence and the law of the strongest.This is also reflected in the visual presentation.Swords, for example, can cut plants, wood, fabric and even flesh and bones.Example of our realtime slicing & destruction system.The level of violence can be set in three stages:(no gore, blood, full gore) The combat system in 'Remote Knights Online' is designed to be fast, tactical, immersive and fun.Hits are done by weapons collision, there is no target locking or aim assists, players have to decide and aim by themselfs.There are five weapon styles, each with its strengths and weaknesses.(Unarmed, One-handed, Two-handed, Polearm, and Bow)Attacks can be charged in direction and force, which affects damage and range.Evading and parrying have to be timed well.To win against heavily armored opponents you should try to hit the least armored part of the body for maximum penetration or just destroy armor with heavy charged attacks if you have some space.Rhythm and awareness can be decisive in most battle situations.The Action system is structured as follows:Attack action: ((left mouse button + Time) + input direction)Defend action: (right mouse button + input direction)Evade action: (left shift + input direction)Actions share the same cooldown.Making the right choice here is what makes the difference between life and death for your avatar.Attack techniques in detail:Basic melee attacks (fast but not suitable to penetrate heavy armor)Charged melee attacks (heavy attacks with adjustable dash range but leaves you vulnerable while charging)Melee Combos are charged attacks chained together (heavy and fast attack chain but leaves you vulnerable for flank's while active)Defense in detail:Parry is a reaction action which leaves your opponent vunerable for a short time window, when succesfull.Weapons: (Unarmed,One-Hand,Two-Hand,Lance/Pole)Block requires One-Hand and Shield.

AI, items and entire scenarios change while playing.So you never know what adventure awaits you.   
The AI has a real life cycle and wants to fulfill needs like drinking, eating, resting and adventure. It can also use emotions to communicate with you and other AI's.Which is not only amusing and atmospheric but also invites you to roleplaying. (even in this early version)Apparently the best loot is to be found with dangerous bandits, waylayers, animals, undead and other creatures that roam the world.For larger groups of higher level opponents, you better bring a few friends.At night, most of the residents of Vall Tir retreat to their camps to rest, eat or just be in company. In addition,it is said that in the absence of sunlight the undead crawl out of their graves, driven by the urge for fresh blood.

 
Items are an important part of RKO, your virtual life depends on them.At the moment there are weapons, armor, consumables and tools.Each type varies within quality levels, from common to very powerful and rare.Searching for items is a great adventure in itself.You never know if the next opponent might drop something epic and valuable.Equipment can also break and wear out, so stocking up if possible can be useful.Weapons:Five types of weapons, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.(Unarmed, One-Handed, Two-Handed, Pole, Bow)Armor:Each part of the body represents a hitbox which can be protected by an armor item.Because direct hits with sharp swords, arrows and claws are very bad for your health,you should try to get a full set of the highest possible quality.Consumables:Fresh drinks and good food are just as important to staying alive.They are currently the only source to fill up missing hit points.It is also possible to further process food in order to increase efficiency. To support deep immersion, there is a social interaction system,players can communicate quickly via a pie menu.

<p><strong>Osku</strong> is the village Elder’s hot-headed grandson. Having the blood of a magus family, he also has great potential as a magus. However, in a young age, he became interested in weapons and followed the path of modern weaponry instead. Thankfully, his parents and the Elder respected his preferences and decision to master a different field. The Elder has not given up on Osku studying magic though, always asking Osku if he’s thinking of starting the life of a magus.</p>
<p>Osku has grown to be very proficient in using and even modifying various weapons to suit his fighting style. He boasts that weapons wouldn’t require chanting long spells to deal great damage to an opponent. For example, firing a strong fireball from a gun would only need 2 seconds of charging while it may take 10 – 20 seconds of chanting for traditional magic and the chanting speed would still depend on the caster’s magical ability. He can be usually seen fighting with Razi but he actually cares about him a lot as a friend.</p>

<p><strong>Razi </strong>is the village Elder’s best student in traditional magic. He’s always praised as a genius despite not belonging in a magus family. Razi lost his parents when he was young and he was adopted by the Elder when he was spotted boiling a small forest pond by only staring at it, showing great potential as a magus. He can be usually seen fighting with Osku but he actually cares about him a lot as a friend as well.</p>
<p>Razi, despite being conceited, has great respect towards the Elder who raised him and taught him how to be a skilled magus. He also sees the Elder as his own grandfather.</p>

</div></div>","Arzu Venture is a 2D kemono platform game being developed by Orion's Reverie for PC with future plans for console and mac.  Founded in 2016 in Doha, Qatar. Orion’s Reverie is an international studio of directors, designers, artists, animators, writers, and producers that creates video games, animations, and commercials. As a creative team we go out of our way to get under the skin of every project. We are passionate about our craft, and we challenge ourselves to leave a lasting impression with every piece of work. Arzu Venture is one of ourcurrent projects. Arzu Venture's English trailer 

 
Arzu Venture's Japanese trailer    A 2D kemono platform game with a story that combines fantasy and science fiction. The game is set in the fictional world of Celestia, a world being maintained by twelve Stellar Guardians who are currently in deep slumber. Albeit asleep, their powers remain active in their respective shrines, making it possible for them to maintain the stability of their world. One day, the Elder of Sidus Village felt a great disturbance in the twelve Stellar Shrines, which he thought was a sign of a grave danger befalling Celestia.  You play as Osku and Razi, two childhood rivals tasked to investigate what’s causing the disturbance in the twelve shrines. They set out an adventure of rivalry, not knowing that they were about to face a force that they cannot defeat alone.  
The Protagonists:

Osku is the village Elder’s hot-headed grandson. Having the blood of a magus family, he also has great potential as a magus. However, in a young age, he became interested in weapons and followed the path of modern weaponry instead. Thankfully, his parents and the Elder respected his preferences and decision to master a different field. The Elder has not given up on Osku studying magic though, always asking Osku if he’s thinking of starting the life of a magus.
Osku has grown to be very proficient in using and even modifying various weapons to suit his fighting style. He boasts that weapons wouldn’t require chanting long spells to deal great damage to an opponent. For example, firing a strong fireball from a gun would only need 2 seconds of charging while it may take 10 – 20 seconds of chanting for traditional magic and the chanting speed would still depend on the caster’s magical ability. He can be usually seen fighting with Razi but he actually cares about him a lot as a friend.

Razi is the village Elder’s best student in traditional magic. He’s always praised as a genius despite not belonging in a magus family. Razi lost his parents when he was young and he was adopted by the Elder when he was spotted boiling a small forest pond by only staring at it, showing great potential as a magus. He can be usually seen fighting with Osku but he actually cares about him a lot as a friend as well.
Razi, despite being conceited, has great respect towards the Elder who raised him and taught him how to be a skilled magus. He also sees the Elder as his own grandfather.
 
The world
 

 
Celestia is the fictional world in Arzu Venture. The locations are all very unique with a combination of fantasy and sci-fi elements. We make sure that every scenery is memorable and breathtaking. There will be forests, ruins, dungeons, and other locations that have different climates. Towns are also different from each other as some people prefer the traditional ways of living (e.g. using magic for everyday tasks) while some prefer advanced technology which is evident with each town's design.  Arzu Venture's enemy monsters were carefully designed to fit the dreamlike world of Celestia. The normal enemy monsters were intentionally designed to be simple and cute with vibrant color schemes while the boss monsters were given more details and were made to be bigger to give off a feeling of intimidation and to separate them from the normal monsters.    Like with most platform games, Arzu Venture involves guiding a player character to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to navigate the environment. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the player character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps.  Before starting, the player can choose to play as Osku or Razi. The two characters have different play styles - Osku is a weapon user while Razi mainly uses magic. Each stage will have a boss battle that the player will have to defeat to make progress in the story. 2-player mode will also be available. Each stage will have side quests and locations that will only be accessible if two players cooperate and help each other as Osku and Razi.

If we gather enough funds to hire one more server programmer, we can include online functionalities in the 2-player mode.
What makes Arzu Venture special?
 - Arzu's fantasy-inspired art style is hand painted. We aim to make the players will feel like they are reading picture books while playing the game.
 - An engaging story about friendship, rivalry, and heroism centered in the fictional world of Celestia where advanced technology and traditional magic co-exist. In the story, players can collect story-related items in checkpoints to unlock a series of paintings as rewards. This way, players can enjoy the deepest parts of the story, which is rarely provided in action games nowadays.
- The two playable characters have very distinct play styles that are both needed for 2-player mode which will really give the players a real sense of cooperation. 
- Animated cut scenes.
- An interactive platformer gameplay that would also require puzzle-solving skills.
- Cute and likable kemono characters designed by well-known artists in the internet. And that includes that monsters!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Raise the dead is a work of art I really want to get out there. I want to create a cute game that's goofy and fun. I chose something that people normally see as scary, zombies, and made it cute. Making the zombies 'almost' harmless also makes for a fun, relaxed experience of a farming styled game.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p>- Herding zombies and keeping them in cells.<br/>- Synthesize various potions.<br/>- Use potions to perform experiments on zombies.<br/>- Research and develop new upgrades, potions and tech.<br/>- Farm plants.<br/>- Customize your lab<br/>- Play around with the cutest of zombies.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds will make sure I have enough money to purchase any extra help and any extra software or assets the game might need.</p>
<p>The plan is to get the game on Steam and many other stores. Steam keys will allow for easy distribution and a centralized place where the game can be updated. Steam keys would be preferred if we do get onto Steam, however if not, there are other stores like Itch.io, Humble, etc. There will also be a soundtrack available (you can preview some of it here: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/deadgravity/sets/raise-the-dead-sample-playlist"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/deadgravity/sets/raise-t...</a> ).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The game will be completed even if the funding goal is not reached, however, reaching the goal will make sure I can deliver the best game possible.</p>

If you are playing Warrior then just Warrior leveling up, if you switch to Ranger, you are starting to level that class instead.  CollectionYou are going to find new Collections while you are playing, those Collection do you need to move forward in the game. All classes have different Collections. All have different abilites too!You are wearing it always, and making you stronger too.   
Many places to explore.
Collection system (Finding Weapons).
Rifts (Not fully finshed yet)
Day & Night Cycle
   And more can come after a while..  And much more!You have a big world to explore, you are going to have a great adventure. Finding Caves, Castle, Towns and much more. Talking with NPC, buy stuff, meet bosses, find secrets, get gold, shards and so much more!   I have been worked with this project around 1700+ hours, without any help. But now I feel the more I'm getting closer, there is more things I need to spend money on. Later I need to start a Company that cost, and Website host, marketing, maybe find someone that can help me with the project to get it faster on the later updates.",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Summary
As a Dad of gamers, I searched for game servers on which my boys and their friends could play, ideally:

high performance
cost effective
on-demand
private

The options available were always lacking in one or more of those characteristics.  They were either:

low quality
expensive
always running

Rats Alley provides that missing option for gamers of all ages, and for parents of gamers.

What We Need
The initial development stage of Rats Alley is complete, and in alpha release (which you can see at RatsAlley.net).  Registration is closed off to the public, but the system is being used by a group of stalwart Alpha Test Heroes.  Before we can open up the Rats Alley site for registration, we need:

AccountingRats Alley wants your money!  But we also want to manage that money well, and have the financial systems in place and personnel under contract.  We estimate about $2,500 to get that set up.


UX / Graphic DesignThe Rats Alley game server system is working well, but boy is it ugly!  It is amazing how a good User Experience designer can transform a web application, even if the base functionality remains the same.  We estimate about $15,000 for a complete front-end usability overhaul and graphic upgrade.


Third-party Validation
​The independent identity and age verification system we want to use (https://blockscore.com) is legally bound to only provide services to businesses with a commercial address.  The software development company (https://greenhollowtech.com) that is engineering Rats Alley has been, since its founding in May 2011, a home-based business.  Local office space is available for $6,000 for the first year, which would provide the required commercial physical address to contract with the verification provider.



The Impact
Your contribution will empower Rats Alley to provide quality and affordable game server hosting with a solid fiduciary and legal foundation as well as a great looking and easy to use front end.

<p><strong>Allenstapt</strong>, a vast temperate planet, billions of years old, has declined for millennia. After a hundred generations passed, the creatures alive now have never felt a storm among their surface. Grass grows, trees remain staunch, but drought grips any who attempt to irrigate or farm the land. The planet's temperature has slowly even declined, with fears that a couple hundred years in the future, the earth they stand on may just simply freeze over. The cause of the slow calamity is known. <strong>Dragons</strong>, primal beings of pure elemental force and will, which have manifested and drawn unique connections to the cosmos' forces, are dying out. Patrons and Matrons alike, since the dawn of creation, dragons have created beings in their own image or to fulfill their objectives. Without them, all creation slides closer to the brink of desolation. Good and evil conspire to allow the spread of conflict and calamity to worsen and spiral further out of control. As a boy reaches adulthood and joins the Human Kingdom Corps, a military branch of human civilization, an incident forces him out of his old life and into a new purpose. This incident, which starts as a mere ripple, will become a typhoon across the universe; as an adventure spanning worlds unfolds. And the hope of restoring order to creation rests in the hands of <strong>the Boy from Dragons.</strong></p>

<p>DRM didn't exist.</p>
<p>In-game purchases didn't exist.</p>

<p>Alphas that last seven years and somehow reach v3.123141 also didn't exist.</p>
<p>I could also get higher than level 4 when I purchased a video game. -.- Monsters.</p>
<p>There was no emphasis on open-world or crafting that turn the video game into a soup of spending days hitting rocks off trees to build cabins so that you can play two hours a day, and someone else who plays 22 hours a day can destroy it.</p>
<p>That's not how we enjoy stories and shouldn't be why we enjoy games. The Boy from Dragons isn't about leaping back; it's about pulling forward everything we love in video games and making it today's project with today's technology.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Dean, and I'm the author of The Boy from Dragons: Tales, which just successfully funded on Kickstarter. We have plans to launch a whole series this year, one after another, and so this falls in line with issues in Kickstarter's rules, which are you have to complete the campaign, AND rewards first. Some rewards can take 3 months to a year to manufacture. So it's OK, we did one good project with them, now we are here for our video game, as we are way too far into production to wait, and planned to release it hot on the tails of the book. I am a creative writer and indie game developer, who like many, has been indoors for much of the pandemic. I have started to explore my creativity in creative writing, artistry, and coding, and the journey has been mind-blowing. Growing up, I had stories I loved like everyone else, and although I took very strongly to video games instead of books, their level was the most crucial component of what I enjoyed. My experience with some of those games would carry over twenty years, and I still look back on with admiration and joy. There is, however, also a bit of sadness. With the best stories I have ever been able to even imagine, some of my favorite games never got to continue growing with me. Their sequels never happened and eventually were canceled, not by the artists, because artists never stopped dreaming, but by the publishers. Our new series won't be, because we didn't use any.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our studio is led daily by a dev team with individuals who do it all. Gamers who are executives, JRPG/RPG fanatics, and developers with skill and experience. Having our lead developers from diverse backgrounds allows up to wear more hats, cut costs, and still deliver a polished product. Our two head individuals do 20 Years+ combined experience in the business but double that in playing video games and appreciating craft. We set the budget of the task at 41,700. At 100% funded, we understand our game's capacity to end up around 60 hours on Steam and Switch. However, that's not all we want to deliver! To fully realize the dream for this game and ensure a classic full-length feel of 60+ on ALL consoles, we need to surpass this amount well and attempt stretch goals without community! We need to crush that budget goal, so the next time you want to pick up a JRPG classic, it's off the Steam store or PS Network. Not a Rom, a publisher, didn't appreciate 20 years ago that still deserves to be played today.</p>

<h2><strong>Welcome to Terra Second!</strong></h2>
<p>Terra Second gathers the world visionaries in an online environment. There we can do what comes most naturally to us humans – to play. We belong together in little societies, we constantly communicate and we develop ideas of how to make a world the way we want it to be. We dare to face challenges – such as artificial intelligence, natural disasters, social problems, you name it…</p>
<p>Welcome to Terra Second! Who knows what stands in front of us?</p>
<p>We are creating a model for a better, more rewarding human civilization.</p>
<p>We volunteer to provide the solutions, which will make the world a better place for living.</p>
<h1>Who we are:</h1>
<p>We are a united international team of visionaries, IT gurus and civil activists joining our efforts across five European countries. We have put to use the British accuracy, the German neatness, the Spanish passion, the Polish innovative thinking and the Turkish reverence for past traditions. Together we have developed a platform that aids in synchronous and asynchronous distance</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>The E-Referendum</h1>
<p>The University for Applied Sciences, Bern, Switzerland brought us together. We have been inspired by Switzerland, the ""Admiral"" of referendums, but we have also experience with a project for legislative changes conducted in Bulgaria. Thus our e-referendum came into being. It supported the organization of a Round Table (think about the Arthurian Legend) in the Bulgarian Presidency featuring expert participants from Germany, Switzerland, Latvia, and Canada.</p>
<p>While we were doing this, we got to meet everybody. We have contacts of various communities from all around the globe, reactive, enthusiastic communities who are willing to change the patterns of the current human reality.</p>
<p>Our Cisco Academy, launched in 2001 made possible the gathering of a company of IT specialists, working on different positions all over the globe. Nowadays, they keep on cooperating on a variety of IT projects.</p>
<p>We are proud to present our Terra Second – a social game that is in its essence a simulator of an alternative human reality. It provides the experience of global cooperation to all kinds of business, art and entertainment people, who wish to contribute to alternative solutions for the world we live in. We will discuss challenges and opportunities, create ideas, and make decisions. Through voting, we can implement different scenarios and estimate how their application will affect a world like ours.</p>
<p>We will teach ourselves how to take part in a referendum as a part of our daily round. We guarantee the immaculateness of our results by using the blockchain technology. Everyone can become a “miner” independently of his computer capacity and contribute to the program security.</p>
<p>Thus we will learn to give vent to our strategic solutions and our political representatives can learn how to implement them and finally earn their wages honestly. </p>
<p>This game can practically change our lives…And that’s not all!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h1>What Do We Need And What You Will Get</h1>
<p>All financial contributions will accelerate the creation of Version 1 – the prototype of the game. Obviously, this project needs a lot more than just funds. Everyone can participate and aid progress. It's a huge, ambitious project, the risk of the investors is shared. We work really hard.</p>
<p>We are building Terra Second – the game, as well as a network of collaborators and this game,  will evolve continuously. The players will be able to redefine the rules of the game at some point of this development.</p>
<p>How can you contribute? We accept hosting and cloud services, skilled labor from volunteering designers and web developers, as well as online marketing specialists.</p>
<p>We also need a group for testing and generating ideas for improvement of the game, so volunteering is valuable to us.</p>
<p>Each contribution will be highly evaluated and rewarded – everything from writing code, to relevant contacts. Probably, there will be additional bonuses except the ones mentioned in Indie GoGo.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p>The Internet has turned the world in a big village. Our social game Terra Second is the opportunity to involve in what's happening to us, to navigate our destiny. It truly is a game for visionaries. Its environment is beautiful and emotional, moreover – it will redefine the rules of Life, and most important of all – you guys, who care for our beautiful planet will finally get the chance to meet each other! We will discuss solutions for global challenges – how we came into being, what technological needs do we face, how do we rule societies and the world. Some of the players will have the chance to constitute an entirely new set of Rules and Laws, for the betterment of human civilization. This is the ultimate Goal of the Game.</p>
<p>We are aware that immense interest and significant efforts are put into revealing the past of our Human Race. Haven’t you asked yourself – Who we are? Where do we come from? Why are we what we are? Are we a product of genetic experiments? Does someone control us?</p>
<p>We are nowadays getting excited about the colonization of the Moon and Mars, and the development of international space programs can also be based on ideas generated by Terra Second.</p>
<p>What do you think? Can the collective mind help us all find adequate solutions for the plenty of challenges faced by our civilization? This game, Terra Second, this social experiment will give rise to the people and open new ways ahead of them.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h1>Risks and Challenges</h1>
<h2>Technical challenges</h2>
<p>Until now, there has been no e-referendum based on the blockchain, not even in Switzerland. The Game Terra Second is actually a simulator for crowd self-study and the next application in real voting systems. We have also drawn in our team as consultants some top experts of the blockchain. Until now, they are quite experienced only with the application of blockchain, for the creation of cryptocurrency. We now have to experiment with different applications and create the base version of the game.</p>
<h2>The Concept</h2>
<p>Nowadays we are bombarded with all kinds of messages, and a lot of them distract us from the real challenges. Everyone needs to walk his way and follow his legend, and reach a certain state of maturity – and that cannot be accomplished only with education.</p>
<p>But among the billions of humans on Earth, at least millions are at a certain intellectual level – to perceive by themselves, rationalize, discuss ideas, generate their own ideas and participate in e-voting via blockchain. Yes, they can do this!</p>
<p>The Question is:</p>
<p>Are you among them?</p>
<h2>Possibilities for reaching out</h2>
<p>In the beginning, when we create Terra Second – there is naturally a lack of resources. The most important of resources is obviously the people. We aim at creating a community from reformers and gathering active people all over the world – like the Space Kingdom Asgardia or the Italian Damanhur. Thousands of clubs for UFO, associations for technical progress, debate communities exist all over the world, and we are interested in empowering them through our game platform.</p>
<h2>Political challenges</h2>
<p>Yes, we challenge the System, the Matrix and they will try to defy us, and that’s the wonderful evidence that we are on the right track.</p>
<p>We expect the unexpected. We prepare ourselves for hard scenarios. We hire security experts, but we are not being paranoiac.</p>
<h2>A Shocked Human Civilization</h2>
<p>We are prone to not believing the real threats that stand in front of us.</p>
<p>When some negative events happen people tend to blame that on conspiracy theories. What if we prove them wrong? What if professional astronomers, geologists, and other scientists present convincing facts for an inevitable natural disaster? For instance the cyclic switch of the magnetic poles? How will all of this affect the psyche, will, possibilities and reactions of some of the game players and the Big Brother watching us – authorities, governments, media?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let’s make Terra Second the land of the free and the home of the free…</p>

<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Enthusiasm is contagious and very important. We will be incredibly grateful to all of you who wish to contribute with their services. We are in dire need of enthusiasts in all aspects of creation – from hosting services to civil activists. We appreciate it even if you share about the project in your Social Media or your video blog on YouTube, featuring your opinion and recommending the game. Please, share your reasons to support us, no matter what way you chose. It is impossible to predict all the opportunities for you to be a part of this futuristic project. </p>

<p>Field players have 4 skills: pass, dribble, shoot and defense. Goalkeepers have 3 skills: pass, defense and goalkeeping.</p>
<p>Skill <b>values</b> range from 1 (lower) to 5 (higher) and each player has a <b>unique</b> combination of values. For example, attackers usually have higher shooting whereas defenders have higher defense.</p>
<p>Player cards have two sides: black or white. If you are playing in the black spaces of the board, you use the black side of the cards. Otherwise, you use the white side.</p>

</div></div>","Warm up!
Rollplay Football is a board game about football. It has 10 different teams and 110 unique player cards.
Pick your team and control your favourite players in a board that looks like a football pitch.
The rules are simple: score more goals than your opponent and win the match!
What you get:

1 game board
10 team cards
110 player cards
45 coach cards
10 ball tokens
5 black dice (1x d20, 2x d12, 2x d6)
5 white dice (1x d20, 2x d12, 2x d6)
1 rulebook






Kickoff!
You and your opponent take turns, first the attacker, then the defender. The attacker tries to pass the ball between his players, dribble and shoot to score a goal. The defender needs to move the players wisely, and choose the right moment to tackle to get the ball.
Each player has its own set of skills. Higher skills give you higher dice, thus a better chance to succeed in skill checks.
There are also special coach cards that can be played at any time to tip the balance to your side. Use them to turn opportunities into fantastic goals!
ARE YOU UP TO THE CHALLENGE?





8'Player cards
Player cards represent football players. Each card has the player's team colors, the starting position for that player in the pitch, and a set of skills.
Like in real football each team has 11 players: 10 field players and a goalkeeper.

Field players have 4 skills: pass, dribble, shoot and defense. Goalkeepers have 3 skills: pass, defense and goalkeeping.
Skill values range from 1 (lower) to 5 (higher) and each player has a unique combination of values. For example, attackers usually have higher shooting whereas defenders have higher defense.
Player cards have two sides: black or white. If you are playing in the black spaces of the board, you use the black side of the cards. Otherwise, you use the white side.





17'Game board
The game board is a football pitch 53x79 cm large. It has 31 black spaces and 31 white spaces to place the player cards. One team uses the black spaces and the other team uses the white spaces.





23'Actions, skills and dice!
Players use their skills when they do actions. For example, if a player is passing the ball, the value of the pass skill represents how well he passes the ball.
Sometimes players have to do a skill check to see if the action is successful or not. Skill checks use dice. An higher skill has an higher dice, so an increased probability of being successful.





Help us making it happen!
We have been working on this game for the past two years. The game is ready to go, but we need your help to make it happen.
The total production costs for 1000 copies are near 20.000€.
We are hoping to raise 10.000€ from this campaign and, if we reach this goal, the project will go ahead and we will support the rest of the investment.





What comes next?
This campaign will run for 2 months.
We will have weekly updates with details about each individual component. While detailing each component we will further explain how to play the game.
And don't forget that we have special stretch goals if we meet our main objective!
CAN YOU HELP US SPREAD THE WORD? 





When will you get the game?
We are able to produce the game in 2-3 months after the campaign ends. 
You will get the game in the beginning of September.

Tiny Armies is small game with a lot of strategy but also balanced with a bit of luck.

I'm working on this game for a very long time and after many playtest, rules and graphic modifications, it's now ready to be launch and for this, I need your help!So help me make this a reality by choosing one of the amazing rewards.Thank you.

Specifications



Minimum Players: 2 Players


Maximum Players: 4 Players


Time: 20 to 40 minutes


Ages: 9+







Includes

64 playing cards (1 1/6"" x 2"")
4 army cards (4"" x 6"")
50 small stars (7/8"" x 7/8"")
1 regular dice
The rules (small booklet)
1 box (4.5"" x 6.5"")





The game objective is to be the one at the end of the game who has earned the most stars. The game ends when all 50 stars have been won. When you play less than 4 players or you want to play a shorter games, use less stars.
There are two ways to get stars: 

By destroying an enemy unit


By stealing stars to other players


SetupAt the beginning of the game each player must have an army card on which he will put (during the game) his combat units. Each player draws three cards from the deck of cards and keeps them hidden from other players.The game is played in the clockwise direction. To determine playing order, each player rolls a dice. The player with the highest dice roll will be the first to play.On a turn...
During his turn a player must respect the following playing order:



Draw one to three cards from the deck. At the end of this turn the player must have 3 cards in his hand. So if a player already has one card in his possession he must draw 2 cards to have a total of 3.


Recruitment : add (if possible) 1 to 2 units on the army card


Playing an action card (Missile or Spy)


Attack an enemy unit (only 1 attack per turn)


Discard 1 card (unless the player has no more cards in his hand)




Recruitment
To recruit a unit in his army, just place the card of this unit on a free space of the army card.

A player cannot stack soldiers on each other. So there should be only one unit per space.  See exception*.

In addition, once a unit is recruited, it can't be moved or switched to another space.

The recruitment phase is not mandatory. A player can decide to not recruit any unit and wait for the next turn.

Of course a player cannot recruit if the player has no units in his hand.

*During his recruitment a reserve soldier must absolutely be placed under another soldier already on the army card. So he cannot be placed on an empty space. When the soldier placed on top will be killed, the reserve soldier will automatically take his place and make a counter attack (see attack rules).


Attack rules
The attacking player must choose the unit that will attack and the enemy unit that will be attacked.Then, the attacker rolls a dice.If the score is equal or higher to the defense number, the player destroy the enemy unit and earns the number of star(s) indicated in the upper left corner of the destroyed unit. The destroyed unit is placed at the bottom of the deck. The attack ends.If the attack score is lower than the defense number, the enemy unit is not destroyed and makes a counter attack. Then, the unit rolls the dice. If the score is equal or higher to the defense number of the unit that had previously attacked, it destroys this unit and wins the number of star(s) indicated in the upper left corner of the destroyed unit. The destroyed unit is placed at the bottom of the deck . If the counter attack score is lower than the defense number, the attack turn ends.Particular case (reserve soldier)In the event that an unit is destroyed but has under it a reserve soldier, the reserve soldier reply immediately with a counter attack.The reserve soldiers, the regular soldiers and the gunners cannot attack enemy unit(s) in the 2nd line if there are still enemy unit(s) in the 1st line.

    Risks & Challenges The game is ready and I just need 500$ to start the production.
Why only 500$? Because I have an agreement with my regular printer who is ready to produce in small quantities if necessary.
Also as a graphic designer since 1998, I have a lot of experience in the printing industry.
If you have any question on this topic (or another one), don't hesitate to contact me.

<h2>Zaron</h2>
<p>Zaron is the first multiplayer role-play strategy game which is a completely new genre. In this game, you will be give one of 22 unique factions to control and to write its own story. We have developed a glamorous world with lots of mechanics and opened unlimited capabilities for every single memeber of the game. In fact, you will find intriguing what you can do in Zaron. First, you are able to customize all in-game objects such as clothes, weapons, structures and transport. Second, you are allowed to experience a fascinating turn-based battle system which is slightly different from other systems. Last but not the least, there is an amusing thing, which we call social element. Its main part are inhabitants of each faction, since every NPC in Zaron has his or her own personality. We can even call our game a simulator of the world and society. The history of Zaron’s universe is extremely interesting, and it will be not so easy to reveal it. Therefore, there is a system of “Key moments” and an archive to help you. Every person with a desire will be able to join the game, as there are only two turns in a real-life week. However, don’t think that the game is reluctant since we can assure you that the amount of content allows everyone to find an occupation for the whole time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get into a unique and completely new Zaron universe</li>
<li>Take one of <strong>22</strong> unique factions and their sub-factions under control</li>
<li>Explore breathtaking history of the world</li>

<li>Remember, your actions also affect other players, so this makes the game even more interesting</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The game process description</strong></p>
<p><strong>The beginning:</strong> When the session starts the game generates a completely new world filled with lots of objects, like ancient ruins connected to the world history or material deposits. All the factions of the game are also randomly situated in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Factions:</strong> As it was said before, first thing that the player does when he or she joins the Zaron session is choosing a faction which he or she wants to play for.</p>
<p><strong>Character:</strong> Then players need to describe the appearance of their characters, who later will be the leader of one of the inter-factional structures (either the government of the faction, guild of tradesmen, aristocratic family or anything else).</p>
<p><strong>NPC:</strong> The game is filled with different structures and even more - NPC. Everybody in Zaron has his own system of goals and values, so it won’t be so easy to govern the faction and to demand on others.</p>
<p><strong>Game process: </strong>When players got into the world, they should once at a turn give multidirectional orders, which can affect different aspects of the game. Every player receives an introductory at the beginning of the turn. Then they give orders to all NPC they have under control. Remember, every one of them has his or her own character and together they form a society.</p>
<p><strong>Craft:</strong> The player can develop technologies and create new objects. Every faction possesses different technologies and different branches of development tree from the very beginning. In this “trees” players will get the access to materials and modules with which they are allowed to create a big variety of things. All in all, there are one technological, one social and 11 magical “trees” in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Magic:</strong> Magic is one of the widest aspects of the game. Zaron theory is very laconic, but the practical part is quite vast. You’ll prove that to yourself during the game.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership: </strong>The leadership of the faction almost always is given to the first player who joined it, but it doesn’t mean that the faction will obey that player. First of all, Zaron is a game about power, deceit and social interaction. Every willing person can become a leader and every willing person can conquer him (with a share of luck, of course). If a player does something, what contradicts the morality of the faction, he risks losing all his power in it. Every action has its serious consequence. In addition, all the player’s acts are evaluated by every NPC that knows you according to unique characters and systems of values, what makes the game multifaceted.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer aspects:</strong> When a player meets another faction, after establishing the contact he or she is able to spread your influence (which is quite difficult), and the game will become more complicated. However, don’t think that players in your faction will be only helping you. You both can come to an agreement, starting a cooperation, or end up in the argument, declaring the war.</p>
<p><strong>Dungeons:</strong> There are a lot of different places in the world, visiting which can really be interesting. There are opportunities to discover parts of Zaron’s history or get mighty artifacts in them. Each place has its own story and all the stories are combined into one vast world. But reconnaissance data can become obsolete, the recon team can be killed or bribed, and rumors can be deceptive.</p>
<p><strong>Key moments:</strong> “Key moments” are one of the most interesting and important aspects of the game. The player can name every action as KM and play it from the first person. It doesn’t matter whether it is a battle or a guest visit, the player will get into a place where he’ll be able to interact with any object and change the world. Usually KM are declared in advance, and the world is described by one of the duty dungeon masters.</p>
<p><strong>History: </strong>There are a lot of scattered books and texts, including fragments of past history events. The collection of your own library is an important part of the game, and it will become a real challenge for every player, who wants to know the real history of Zaron’s universe.</p>
<p><strong>Session: </strong>Zaron session lasts for a long period of time and ends when one of the players collects enough power to control 90% of the intellectual planet population. But don’t care about it, the main part is the game process and the world exploration. The capabilities are amazing with their diversity, so use them. We have everything: the plot, magic system, technologies and the mechanics, in secret not just for fun. We can assure you that it would be really interesting for you to discover it yourself by collecting everything from pieces, and to realize that everyone has his or her own truth. Change the world and live a unique life as everything is in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Community goals:</strong></p>
<p><strong>12000$ - Faction interface </strong>Braided by lianas or immersed into the sea depth - faction interface will be in special stylistics</p>
<p><strong>12500$ - 3D markers for maps</strong> (what can be better?)</p>
<p><strong>13000$</strong> <strong>- Character development tree </strong>(“Everybody is unique” - game characters will have their own development trees)</p>
<p><strong>13500$</strong> <strong>-</strong> <strong>Voice chats </strong>(“Text is great, but voice is better” - we’ll make voice chats for Key moments)</p>
<p><strong>14500$ - Impulse KM</strong> (If you want to play an interesting KM not connected to the game - it is for you)</p>
<p><strong>15000$ -</strong> <strong>Alchemy/farming/blacksmith's craft</strong></p>
<p><strong>15500$ - 3D view of Key moments</strong></p>
<p><strong>17000$ - Archive illustrations</strong></p>
<p><strong>17500$ - In-game translator </strong></p>
<p><strong>18000$ - Free platform for creating Key moments </strong>(Only for you and your friends)</p>
<p><b>20</b><strong>000$ - Zaron BattleGrounds </strong>(1st person view for KM)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Thank you:</strong> Thank you a lot for your help, we’ve been working on this project for already half a year and it would be great if we finally succeed. With your contribution, Zaron is destined to become an amusing game with lots of great mechanics and interesting history, so we hope for all your support.</p>

Multiplayer aspects: When a player meets another faction, after establishing the contact he or she is able to spread your influence (which is quite difficult), and the game will become more complicated. However, don’t think that players in your faction will be only helping you. You both can come to an agreement, starting a cooperation, or end up in the argument, declaring the war.
Dungeons: There are a lot of different places in the world, visiting which can really be interesting. There are opportunities to discover parts of Zaron’s history or get mighty artifacts in them. Each place has its own story and all the stories are combined into one vast world. But reconnaissance data can become obsolete, the recon team can be killed or bribed, and rumors can be deceptive.
Key moments: “Key moments” are one of the most interesting and important aspects of the game. The player can name every action as KM and play it from the first person. It doesn’t matter whether it is a battle or a guest visit, the player will get into a place where he’ll be able to interact with any object and change the world. Usually KM are declared in advance, and the world is described by one of the duty dungeon masters.
History: There are a lot of scattered books and texts, including fragments of past history events. The collection of your own library is an important part of the game, and it will become a real challenge for every player, who wants to know the real history of Zaron’s universe.
Session: Zaron session lasts for a long period of time and ends when one of the players collects enough power to control 90% of the intellectual planet population. But don’t care about it, the main part is the game process and the world exploration. The capabilities are amazing with their diversity, so use them. We have everything: the plot, magic system, technologies and the mechanics, in secret not just for fun. We can assure you that it would be really interesting for you to discover it yourself by collecting everything from pieces, and to realize that everyone has his or her own truth. Change the world and live a unique life as everything is in your hands.
Community goals:
12000$ - Faction interface Braided by lianas or immersed into the sea depth - faction interface will be in special stylistics
12500$ - 3D markers for maps (what can be better?)
13000$ - Character development tree (“Everybody is unique” - game characters will have their own development trees)
13500$ - Voice chats (“Text is great, but voice is better” - we’ll make voice chats for Key moments)
14500$ - Impulse KM (If you want to play an interesting KM not connected to the game - it is for you)
15000$ - Alchemy/farming/blacksmith's craft
15500$ - 3D view of Key moments
17000$ - Archive illustrations
17500$ - In-game translator 
18000$ - Free platform for creating Key moments (Only for you and your friends)
20000$ - Zaron BattleGrounds (1st person view for KM)
 
Thank you: Thank you a lot for your help, we’ve been working on this project for already half a year and it would be great if we finally succeed. With your contribution, Zaron is destined to become an amusing game with lots of great mechanics and interesting history, so we hope for all your support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

But how many times have you
thought ...

“what if there could be a

“Wish I could take a look at
my opponent’s hand?”

Short Summary We love Texas Hold'em !!!!
We love card games !!!
We love giving life a little twist !!!!!
You will love Pokerish

How Pokerish Works
Pokerish is an add-on card game which joins a regular Texas Hold'Em Poker game night. 

Pokerish though doesn't cut the rhythm off of the poker game. It is silently embedded into your game, and brings up the adrenaline and the excitement, using only some basic rules.






At the beginning of the game
each player gets dealt 2
POKERISH cards clockwise
starting first with the
small blind.

You may now start playing
regular texas hold'em poker. 







The general rule of the game
is that each player can play
any card, WHILE HE IS ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATING IN A ROUND.
Each player can play only
one card, until the dealer
button changes player.

Each card used goes to the
“used cards” deck face down.

When there are no cards left
at the “card’s deck” the “used
cards” deck get reshuffled
and the cards are back into
play.

When the dealer button
makes a full circle, each
player (starting again with
the dealer) can draw up to 2
cards from the POKERISH deck
in order to have again 2 in his
hand. 





The Cards 
Pokerish cards are designed respecting poker's rules and traditions. The names of the cards and the descriptions, aim to entertain the player by referring to wild wild west and several other historical facts.  They are not intended to offend any race, culture or group of people.

CHILDREN HAVE A KNACK FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS IN SIMPLE WAYS.
             Growing up we would always trade video games back and forth with other kids because we were to young to work a job as a means to buy games. As we grew older our disposable income increased while fewer people where around to trade games with.
              ""There should be a way to expand the trading process we used to do when I was younger. A service that opens up the amount of people to trade with over the barriers of distance, age, and acquaintance.""


AFTER 2-3 MONTHS OF EFFORT, AS OF 2016 THAT SERVICE IS FINALLY HERE.

   Risks & Challenges




What are alternative solutions for those people?


Buy the game new


Buy the game used


Online rental service


Neighborhood rental

Trade with current friends


What makes this solution better than the alternatives for those people?



It's less expensive to trade for the game than buy it new


It's less expensive to trade for the game than buy it used and there is a bigger selection of games then a store would provide.


It's less expensive to trade for the game than pay a monthly service fee for an online rental service; which charges the customer even if they are not currently using the service.


It's less expensive to trade for the game than pay a fee for a rental that you get to keep for a limited amount of time.


There are a wider selection of gamers to trade with than a persons current set of friends.

I am Alexey. I am one of the main developers of the project “Willderia”. We’ve been working on the project for more than half a year. There are 11 people in our team of developers. In addition to the core staff, we closely cooperate with users from other countries who are directly involved in the development of our project. At the moment we’ve spent about $ 35000 on the project. This amount includes the cost of purchasing essential equipment, the purchase of Content and support for our developers. As for the creation of the game, the idea appeared by chance while sitting over a beer with a friend. Having started talking about some pirate romance, how it would be cool to plunge into a modern game with stunning graphics and incredible adventures that could drag you into yourself. Based on colorful memories of my favorite game ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2"" we began to form a staff of employees who got mad when they hear the word pirates. There were not so few of them! Here it all started. Allocating tasks and roles, we immediately started creating a game! We put our souls into this project because it’s more than just a game. We check everything 10 times and until all the staff agrees, the content won’t be included in the game. The creation of the game has become one of the main components of life for us and takes at least 12 hours a day for development. Such a fast pace affects the family relationships and the main job which helps to keep the project afloat and compensate the enthusiasm of the Developers! We want to introduce our game to you and hope that you will like it. Depending on your support we will decide how quickly and efficiently the game will be launched. Involving funds we are looking forward to the release of the game in Steam in early access to the 3rd quarter of the 19th year. The game will be released in the format of buyToPlay and those users who support our project will be provided with various bonuses. (Silver / Gold / Platinum kits). You can read more on the site. Initially, the game will be multi-server type where each player can create his own server and invite friends there. There will also be official servers. In the future, the game will be completely transferred to the MMO RPG mode, where the server will live until the last person playing. </p><p>It is based on ‘Unreal Engine 4’. Our Game will go through all stages of development. Alpha, Beta tests. The sandbox mmorpg game is a seamless open world. WillDeria will take you to an era of travel, adventure and piracy. The expanse of the world's ocean with islands and archipelagoes will open up before you. You’ll have the opportunity to touch the unique worlds with their own ecosystems, different climatic zones and the habitat of animals. The dream of every traveler is to explore the harsh Arctic zones, impenetrable forests and tundra marshes, tropical thickets and hot sandy deserts, tops of the highest mountains and intricate branches of karst caves. All these studies will not do without the private transport. Riding on a horseback or in a cart overland and by sea on a ship or a boat. Numerous types of ships, from the rowing boat to the legendary Manovars, will make adventures even more fascinating! The world of Willderia is a harsh and dangerous place which is not for weaklings. You will need protection things, and which ones you choose. There is a large variety of small arms, muskets and pistols, bows and crossbows. A huge selection of melee weapons: knives, daggers, swords, axes, halberds and more. Defend yourself with any facilities, whether it is a hammer or a stone. Any means are good in a dangerous situation! And you will have enough enemies. A wild animal or any other man, whether it’s a pirate or a nice guy, can harm you. The sea is no less dangerous place. Predatory inhabitants will not let you quietly admire the underwater beauties. People - that's the main enemy. Sea battles are an integral part of the journey around the world of WillDeria! You can’t do without navigation. Compass and map are the best companions for any traveler.</p><p>When going on a long trip or voyage, you need to take care of provisions. A variety of food will pacify the ardor of any gourmet, but do not dream of eating a restaurant dish in the middle of the desert! Hunting and fishing will save you from starvation. And an oasis or any other source of water will not let you go crazy with thirst. Traveling the world, you have found a beautiful place and want to stay there</p><p>forever?! The system of building houses and villages will give you this opportunity! You can build your little house by the river. Or together with other players you can establish a village, or even a city with a pier and a wall for protection. And believe me, the wall will come in handy! The system of free ""PVP at any time in any place"", you can be killed.</p><p>There will be no levels in the game. The system of skills is constructed in the following way – the things you do you get pumped. At any time, you can choose your type of activity and achieve mastery of a skill. Depending on the skill level, some certain ""skills"" will appear. For example, such as ""skill fencing"" which is responsible for the accuracy and strength of the impact. ""Parrying"" bias, block of impact. The skills of the gunner - ""the speed of reloading the gun"" ""accuracy"", etc.</p><p>Let’s sum up. Willderia is a various game. Everyone will find a place here, whether you are a warrior, a robber, a merchant or an artisan and even if you are a farmer – just get a cattle, plant vegetables and live peacefully on the continent! There is a place for everybody! But if you're a pirate, assemble a team as quickly as possible, build a ship and go forward to adventure! And now I want to conclude my statement. I hope you enjoyed it, thank you for your attention.</p></div>","We present to Your attention the project sandbox MMORPG-WillDeriaThe game will reveal the whole romance of adventure and piracy.The game is currently in development.

<p>I’m offering you a dark fantasy story with secrets and details that are not always visible at first sight. The story will be written no matter you are involved in events or not. But you will have an opportunity to participate in it and bring it into your sight. The basic idea: you are not a super hero, who is able to change whole world, but you will have an opportunity to change the outcome of events. You are a cogwheel which will behave well or badly. Also you will have a wide set of battles - an important part of the game. So, move on.</p>
<p><u><i>small hint:  if you don't want to read the details about every part of the game, just scroll down page and look the screens. It will help you to understand the game briefly</i></u></p>
<p>The game format is an old book with illustrations. The second part of the game is the game board where you have to make measured steps. The board where the tactical part takes place. A chessboard-like type, to be more precise. </p>
<p>Third part is playing cards. Yes, old paper playing cards with illustrations. </p>
<p>Summing all these things up, we can have some picture. Yes, it’s unclear (yet). We will fix it soon.</p>
<p>We have a book with a story, we are free to move where we want (and we will have many opportunities there), we take parts in events (or don’t, everything will have an affect on the story). If we are involved in turmoil (fights), we will have deep interaction on a game (tactics) board with actions and game cards.  </p> <p>Are you still intrigued? Do you want to understand what kind of the story are waiting for you and how it works? Let's talk about each thing in details.</p> <h3 style=""margin-left:120px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531363398/owahznhiu3u6ipefeqip.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>Some global events that are the foundation of the story have ALREADY happened. The world is huge, but these events had an effect on massive territories and all aspects of life by it’s own kind. Some aspects significantly changed, some ones felt changes less. The main essence - the world has changed, and the inhabitants have adapted to it, some ones had not. The population significantly decreased. There are no inhabitants who passed consequences without a trace.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531377760/scfg6fknzcfbmfxwjbza.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are experiencing the world, where the Middle Ages live style is still a base of surviving and total atmosphere, similar to NoMans Lands and Wilds (hello, The Witcher 3!). Meanwhile, past events played a great role (which are related to the story and the plot of the game), which gave a rise for rudiments of the first discoveries (and in some places and not the first) such as mechanics, possibility to use the electricity and the first devices based on it, steam machines, and other stuff.</p>
<p>To clarify a bit what is waiting for you and leave some space to your mind, I will propose an example.</p>
<p>Imagine  “Fallout” world with all it’s technologies, made in past, or Morrowind world with the Dwemers, who have sunk in ages (past events in the game had been not so far ago). But all this story stuff moved to the Middle Ages. One of you might remember Arcanum with magic and technologies, but it will be far from the truth. By the story, there is no opposition between technology and magic. Technology is more like something, that has made an incredible leap and great discoveries. It has become impossible to move this line in the modern world where player take place. The knowledge is lost and there no help to wait from inside with new one. A kind of Post apocalypse in the Middle Ages. As all popular stories like, humanity had not been mutilated beyond recognition. But big changes have come (including weather). You have to find out what happened and choose your own way through this difficult world environment.</p>
<p>Many of you can say: Why do you just not tell the basic story? I have an answer – you have to find what is going on in this world and the main plot. Every detail will give you a spoiler of the key of the story moments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This story is about the world and events, but not about specific heroes. Nevertheless, the game will have many unique picturesque characters with its dark stories. All of these individuals who found a place in this world has its own interests, and you have to act with them ... or not.</p>
<p>I can’t say for sure at this moment, but we have a plan to implement Afterword for each character you met (as in Fallout with settlements). The decision to make it will depend on the achieved goals of the Project.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531363276/aeiqrmxzvompvsx2ttij.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531368620/tnrcfbj1vvs8yfyestfw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All of us want to walk in an interesting world to look at spellbinding corners of the lands (whether it's the Huge Old Town with large half empty quarters and haunted interiors or it is ruins of an abandoned tower with its secrets, or the smoggy swamps, the Deep Forests where the light can barely break through).That was small spoiler for you. It’s your choice where you want to go.Every of this part will depend on several factors. First, your desire to explore the Lands (this possibility will be provided). Second, your advertency (as a player) will give you a chance to reveal hidden terrains (or set of character parameters will help you).</p>
<p><br/>There will be many hidden actions in the game. If your character can't find them yet (not enough skills), you can do it by yourself using text input (as in Fallout 1 or Leisure Suit Larry).This is not a mandatory part of the gameplay. Therefore, by carefully reading the story, you will be rewarded with advanced features. These actions can lead you to hidden events, locations, valuable things, etc.</p>
<p>As a result, for example, there will be moments when you can see the Spot in the fields traveling at night, which can lead to a band of bandits ... either to discover a hidden path…or cave in a bush behind a bridge.., or climb onto a ledge that the Book basically does not offer you. Meanwhile, you have to understand, each of your actions can lead not just to a new path or location, but to a danger with the next series of events that you hastily decided to touch. You can’t say for sure where it brings you. Maybe you will end up in the beast den and become its dinner. Whether you have to climb over the ledge, and, if you are missing the appropriate items, you break a leg and remain as lame until the end of the game ... I am joking of course. Realism is good, but we are not interested to make you stumbling with the cane through the whole storyline.</p>
<p>So, your choices can lead you to Events, to New Territories, to Details of the story. Or you will get some type of experience in different forms ( Perks that can be used in other events). The basic idea - the book will give you some uncovered basic interaction mechanics, other part will depend on you and your character. So, the second part will lead you to facilitation of advancement on the story line path. If you want to go straight without exploring the details, at some point of the story you will start to understand: It was worthwhile to look into that draw-well, which you did not like and have to see what it would lead to. Perhaps your life will become even harder after that or… maybe you will get something valuable or learn something that will give you an access to new events and introduce new book characters.</p>
<p>Let admit small benefits about this part of the game. The game provides markers (hello, Witcher 3). If you have visited a key area in the book, the game will mark this place on your map, so that means you do not need to thumb half of the book to get to this place. The terrain is divided on three types of levels. Territories, Locations, and Sublocations. The Territory is a place on the global map (the Big area). Such territory has its own map (illustrated Page in the book) where Locations are marked (Locations that you discovered already). Every location has its own schematic map to give you an basic idea what you may discover here (Sublocations). Sublocations are the minimal main movement part where the player takes place.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531368516/b5zdprq8gyf67bytuwav.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In most cases, it will be an illustrated page with the terrain and your simple set of actions (moves) ... and additional details with hints such as sets of phrases (which can give you a completely new experience about this place). Or it can be explicit direct Actions (indicated by additional illustrations). They are leading to series of new events (a simple example, encounter with a traveler who is passing by on the road).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To get a better idea how it looks like, let's take another example: Territory: Eastern District near the City, Terrain: near the Weeping Forest, Sublocation: Road Fork.</p>
<p>Here our actions take place like our minimal unit of choice. Whether we want to go - to the village through the fields, or whether we should go straight down the tract towards the old farm, making our way to the city walls along the forest. Or we can notice a small detail: that the branches of the forest are strangely unnaturally moving… you are now getting involved in some new adventure and event proceeding to a remote forest, if you want to, of course.  Each such action has its own price of time.</p>
<p>Any movement takes some period. Walking a couple of hundred meters along the path to the next location will cost you a couple of minutes. For example, if you are making some active action, like talking with a traveler, you begin to understand that person is a hostile and will hit you next moment using knife, you should to make a choice…, or the choice will be made by the  book considering to situation. There will be actions in certain moments when you need to make a decision quickly. This is not a static story with the “Next” button, where you can go to take a cup of tea for 10 minutes and nothing will happen with your character like a random encounter on the road while you are just standing, or flock wolves passing through will not try to hunt on you.</p>
<p>There will be action scenes when your enemy will not wait until you make a choice.</p>
<p>Of course, in most of the moments you can safely hide in some abandoned building to have some rest or craft some sort of extract or just to study materials about a creature you have to fight with. All the actions are described in details; there will be no feeling like you ""are teleported"" from one location to another. If your path is laying from forest to village, the Book will give you a description how you should get there (besides the description of the location itself); if you are moving in the opposite direction, from village to the Forest, there will be absolutely new description of you path, because you see different objects on the way back. ""I chose the action and it seems like something happened"" - this is not about this Book. You will have enough description what is going on not to feel yourself ""hollow"" in the vastness of the story.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531363062/mhomkd7n2zievxbiso1w.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531377393/ueir6tmpe1r59tislrbd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since we are talking about time and it’s directly related to your actions, it worths mentioning some additional details. Real daytime will visually effect on the illumination of the Book for greater immersion in, is not just an aesthetic aspect. Time of day, weather (snow, rain, clear weather) – all of these can effect the world around us. As an example, you can see at night what you have not seen at daytime on the same path. Or you will not notice the path under your nose to the right, or walk along the familiar to you road under the cover of darkness, trying to get to the hut. The game will throw you in situation when you accidentally turn wrong way and find yourself in another place, where you would not ever get under any of other circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let’s remember now that our character is an ordinary person and he has his needs like food, drink (don’t worry, eating and drinking will work automatically. Your character is not so stupid so you have to do everything for him, this stuff will work like in Mount &amp; Blade. The main thing – character should have something to eat in his backpack). Fatigue is key parameter of you character (important in the skirmishes), cold and heat (it is a bad idea to wander in bad weather without a certain equipment). Eventually you may find out that you have pneumonia that will not pass by itself. All of these effect your character state, a possibility to fight in skirmishes and even in simple interactions (if you have a broken leg, this will not make your life easier in combat or in movement). That is a big cascade ecosystem of your character, which affect on your opportunities and will be available for you.</p>
<p>Oh yes, we forgot to add an important thing about exploring. Depending on your choice in the game and achieved project's goals, you will be able to explore the world with company. There will be characters in the game who will be able to join you, but you do not need to travel together. You can split your characters into parties and wander around the world. So, how it works.</p>
<p>If you have more than one party, you can play one party at once, at other parties you can do some stuff (moving to distant territories, craft some items, rest, etc. like in Jagged Alliance 2). Depending on your goals in the Project, you will have a possibility to give some extended job to your party (searching for simple resources, ingredients, hunting, etc.). So you will be able to switch between parties any time and proceed the story in another part of the game world. But you should remember that most of your actions take time and the time goes simultaneously for everyone for every party. You may encounter a situation when you have to choose where to go (intercept some character in different places) so that is an idea to separate party to check few places at once. Also there will be different situations where probably better to have all the characters or only one, as complex parameters can be used to achieve the goal (bigger one, lower one or medium). The game can give a challenge where you can suffer comprehensively; or there will be an action where some special Perk should be used and I will miss some opportunities because you will not have such a character in a current party. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>As a characters getting some perks during the game, one party will get them, the second one will not (although in certain moments that is for good). After all, some Perks can be useful and some can be harmful or just unwanted.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:160px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531363181/tytkovmgox5b6rsgd5ng.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531377155/ebopz9zy386smc8essdf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Let’s talk about the experience. There is no experience in the Book as it is usual for games. Each action can bring you something of its own. You can get hurt or disease, you can hint certain detail in the dialogue - you will get a Perk that will improve or reduce one of parameters of your character; also you can do something bad and the character will get a Perk that can play negative  role on some of events.</p>
<p>It’s worth to notice about one of the game key points - about the status of your characters. You will have a basic set of characteristics at the start and probably this will be the best state of your characters unlike the entire length of the game.</p>
<p>Of course these things can be different but the world is harsh and the ambient environment is not friendly to you.</p>
<p>The world will try to harm you during the story. Depending on the events, you will receive a lot of Effects that will obviously have a negatively effect on you. So it’s better to take care about it (although the choice is yours).</p>
<p>In addition, you will have the back side of the medal - learned skills and knowledge (as Perks, the direct parameter increase, knowledge of alchemy and craft, knowledge about strong and weak creatures’ sides, combat skills, enemy behavior). You will get all of these during the world exploration process. It will compensate negative aspects affected on you in the world. Both of these sides will be present simultaneously. Which side will grow faster depends on you.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p style=""margin-left:160px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531362955/vennuuxyspz0zsmclcuz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Final key moment regarding to territory exploration is our favorite part in all of the games- items that you can be found. There will be no useless garbage in the Book - no forks, plates, caps furniture, etc. for sale (sorry, Skyrim). There will be useful items for some actions (ropes, shovels, hooks, winches, etc.), things needed for craft (like elixirs, salves, powders, other useful items and devices, armor and weapons, depending on stretch goals achieved in the Project), food, valuable stuff worth to be sold.</p>
<p>Item looting and searching also look like a set of actions, a kind of mini quests. That will depend on your skills needed for research or on your advertency (as a player).</p>
<p>For example, you have found an abandoned shack and you want to loot it. The book will give you the opportunity to loot all the stuff  with your naked eye (for example, the Old Shovel, standing in the corner of the shack). But you have to make a closer look with certain skills  to find something special…,or you should read the description of the shack carefully that will give a chance to find a closet or cellar which will lead to something hidden from prying eyes. Perhaps you will need the strength to move the cabinet and get into a hidden shelter with a useful object.</p>
<p>Thereby you will never be able to say for sure if you have learned everything at some place.  This will lead an opportunity to return here later after getting some information from a particular character or when you become more experienced in research.</p>
<h3>Items price and about items themself.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531377064/k3kaa5ihhsqg4ggpigaz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Items will be expensive to buy (sorry, Witcher 3, no bags of gold). This part of the world is lack of supplies. There were better times, but not right now. Most of found items will be not in the best condition (some items will require additional actions before they can be used). To not get into spoilers, some of items will not have magical origin but they do not belong to the Middle Ages stuff. Meanwhile that does not mean that there's a place for high tech fiction items.</p>
<p>If you do not have an opportunity to buy something, you can always try to find it, but it will cost your time and, in addition, a danger related to search, there will be a risk of getting negative effects for the character (as I hinted before, not immediately reveals themselves).</p>
<p>Again, in order to not get into spoilers, I’ll give you a small hint - there will be no packs of Zombies like in Walking Dead TV series. There will be no deadly virus that struck humanity. I can say only one thing, that some events of the past has affected the emergence and spread all known large city medieval disease of (I think you know which one is).</p>
<p>This is not a key event and not a main issue of this world, but it has been already woven into the story and it has took place a bit earlier. So, let’s go back to item search. You will have a risk of getting some negative effects in some places (Disease or Mental effect in the form of depression after you have seen something).</p>
<p>This loot is cheap for your pocket, but perhaps you will have to pay for it by your health. You should deal with it anyway (as it was told before, the Book will not let you understand immediately that you got this effect; this is a kind of SaveLoad AntiCheat system. You will learn about what you get when the time passes. Many of the negative effects have ""incubation time"", so you'll be wondering where you got it). Of course, you can always kill someone. That is the favorite part. You think you have prepared for such actions? Now we are going directly to the combat system.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:160px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531362795/c6snna9zhwzae25qwa0r.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Perhaps some of the readers will find the Tactical and Combat Part a bit difficult. Let us say you are right. That is only at first sight. It becomes nice and clear when you will be dedicated to details.</p>
<p>All the moments are made to ensure that each player have a wide range of choice in combat.</p>
<p>So, let's speak about it more closely.</p>
<p>The game board is represented as a game table with sectors for cards. Each such sector, as like as a chessboard, is the place for the figure (the card in our case). Meaning figure we mean a character, creature or ordinary humanoid enemy. You are free to walk on any of these cells, approaching to or retiring from enemies.</p>
<p>In turn-based mode each unit has a certain number of action points and turns. These turns are movement on the board, Close Combat card use, inventory use, using an active item, or using Effect Cards (Mental Attacks, etc.). You can decide how you will spend your action points using the position of units on the board.</p>
<p>You may ask why the tactical part is important. Let's be more detailed:</p> <p>Each unit has its own unique set of characteristics that affect its State and its danger (as in any game).</p> <p>Each unit has body parts that have their own state, armor (different protection from slash, blunt and piercing damage, etc.). Armor has a state, either does the body part. All of these parameters affect their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Each unit (critters are exceptions, they have their own specifics) has its own set of weapons which affects the abilities of its combat like sets of Close Combat Cards. In addition, this has an effect on ability to conduct offensive and defensive combat depending on the type of unit weapons.</p>
<p>Each unit has a set of knowledge about these Close Combat Cards. This will have an effect on its defensive abilities too.</p>
<p>Depending on unit smartness, he can remember/forget the Close Combat cards used against him. This will give a chance to better repel of attack.</p>
<p>Depending on the character smartness, he will try to use the best card against you (no Random, the probabilities are calculated with the maximum damage against the enemy on the game board)</p>
<p>By the way, there are many ways to effect these mental abilities using Effect Cards, such as Intimidation, Confusion, Panic, or make a character frenzy and attacks everyone on a board. There will be many Effect Cards to learn by completing game events.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531461841/dbmgu3r8l6m2hhlqxhjw.png"" src=""""/><p>Some weapons can cause specific damage as well as Effect Cards.</p>
<p>To make a decision who you want to hit next, you can use any of the proposed choices. Just get a closer enemy to use max action points or you can be a bit smarter. You can use knowledge of Battle Almanac against a particular creature (the similarity of the Witcher Bestiary). You can use the View of the available details of your enemy (detailed information will be available depend on your skills, how good your knowledge is with certain enemy)  </p> <p>Once you have determined your opponent, you are ready to choose Close Fight Card.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:160px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531362678/rextkd1mop0wkbthmo8g.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>What is a Close Fight Card and how does it work.</p>
<p>A Close Fight Card is a set of punches for certain parts of the body. You should decide which parts of the body should be damaged first so that the enemy becomes weaker or more vulnerable, or stops the action which you do not need. Like W.A.T.S. system in Fallout but with sets of punches.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531361975/azvfa9h5yz5msy6yzhaq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each card has a basic version of the strike with certain hit belonged to one of the body parts (up to the 4th level of study).</p>
<p>Depending on the knowledge level of this card, you can use such card for one action. This action produce up to four hits to opponent (for certain body parts).</p>
<p>Depending on your skills (one-handed, two-handed, clubs, etc.), each hit will spend your total number of action points (restored to some level with each new move based on your fatigue and basic characteristics).</p>
<p>Looks difficult, isn’t it? Only At first glance!</p>
<p>Let's use an example to explain how this works.</p>
<p>You are attacked by an enemy with a sword. This is an experienced opponent and he knows some Close Fight Card used with sword. He have studied such card to a 3rd level. Accordingly to knowledge level, he is ready to perform 3 hits on body parts provided by this Fighting Card. But you do not know witch parts of the body enemy will try to hit. Now we are going to the most interesting part of the fight.</p>
<p>How do you protect yourself in this case? Forget about boring static card battles, about the QTE system like insane button push. It will be a short fight which lasts up to half a minute, but you’ll have to think fast.</p>
<p>Every hit scene divided to 3 stages.</p>
<p>First one, the opponent will throw you a card with the first hit flavored with a driving battle</p>
<p>music and attacking screams. The game has more than 600 combat sounds generated for each action set depending on the type of character and damage. You will not be bored to listen the same sounds every time.</p>
<p>If the Card is familiar to you (your character already learned this card), you will see a unique picture with an attack pose and a text symbolizing actions of this attack.</p>
<p>If you are well prepared for a battle, your associative logic (based on the visual perception of the picture and the unique text for each strike) will remember where the hit strikes. You can choose which part of the body should be protected by throwing your defend card.</p>
<p>You will see generated Unknown Special Card - you are unfamiliar with this hit and you will have to guess how to defend yourself. Of course, it will seem a bit difficult in the beginning.</p>
<p>The character needs to know this card, you should remember the picture and text related to a hit. But this is only at the first moments of the game. The more you play, the less hard it will be.</p>
<p>In addition, you have other possibilities to simplify the fight. For example, with having good advertency and reaction you will have more time to decide how you should defend yourself.  Or by using a Special Help Card that will guide you which side of attack you should wait . This will simplify your fight several times. Also, having a shield (depends on the size of the shield)  your choice can be simplified up to two or three choices like to block entire left side of the body or the entire right side.</p>
<p>You should keep in mind that the shields consume a lot of stamina and limited durability. Your action points are restored depending on stamina too. You will have to choose what is more important for you at the moment.</p>
<p>So, that was the second stage called SLO MO. During listening the sound of slow heartbeat you have to make a choice how to fend off an attack.  After the choice has been made, the game will change the rhythm of the music to series of attacks. Further, everything will depend on many parameters of the characters involved in close fight.</p>
<p>The third stage is a result of your choice. You will get Result Card based on your actions with general text which will describe what happened.</p>
<p>Not so difficult, right?</p>
<p>Such an action will be iterated as many times as knowledge level of Card attacker has (and…the action points spent to card, up to four).</p>
<p>After last hit lasts, you can calmly consider the details: the injuries received by each punch; perhaps even details like the enemy was more experienced in weapon skill, quicker or more agile. So you can make a conclusion which tactic to choose next time: change weapon style, etc.  Also you can read Almanac to find out how the opponent is capable of…. If you stay alive, of course. After that, you will return to the tactical board until you win (or lose) the fight.</p>

<p>In addition to the characteristics and skills of your character, player should have some skills too (symbiosis of the player's knowledge and his character). That is the main idea of the card game. You are using your character like an avatar with his own capabilities but your skills as a player is very important too. So the character is a killing machine and you are part of it. If you have played some fighting game, then you should know: each character has its own fight tactic: set of techniques to defend and attack. Every unit has weak and strong sides.</p>
<p>Of course you able to miss a couple of kicks if you have good armor or you are mighty kid with magnificent health. Such fight system provides many opportunities to play as a thief without armor or as a heavy tank. Everyone has its own bonuses like speed, critical hits and so on. So, flimsy thief can bring you notable damage (till you hit him a couple of times). All of these things work in the opposite situation too. Character characteristics, weapon weight, the Close Fight Cards, Effect Cards -  no sense to describe all the list of possibilities you will have. There will be a detailed manual for this part.</p>
<p>Few last extra details: you can use two-handed weapons as one-handed (if you have enough strength). Also there is no limit to have two-handed weapon in each of hand, but keep in mind – weapon weight affects endurance.</p>
<h3>Knowledge and Learning.</h3>
<p>Everything can be learned and every action has counteraction. If you have learned many Cards, you will have many rooms for fighting. If you have studied a certain group of creatures, then you know weak and strong enemy sides. You will gain an advantage on the battlefield. The Witcher game Bestiary could be more useful, because it has a great potential. We will fix this part of the game in our Book and will make it your best friend in surviving. If you are strong in crafting or brewing, you have wide space to protect yourself or improve your characteristics, or get rid of some effects. Some of knowledge you learn thanks to completing Events; some of knowledge you will learn during the battle, some of knowledge you can simply buy for money.</p>

<p>Most the game content, which has been already done, is related to the final goal. So we do not even think to cut something just because we won't be able to deliver it in the StoryLine</p>
<p>The project is huge and  nothing happens from the air(Alas!). So it takes time. Development period about 3 years(that is standart time for a huge game with huge content). </p>
<p>In my opinion, better to wait a bit to get good game at the end unlike do not wait nothing at all,right?</p>
<p><br/>I hope you share this  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Just a few words. One of my character traits is ""Saying the Truth no metter how much it will cost"". So, I will say you as it is.</p>
<p>I am working on the project for two years(29 of May was 2 years date).</p>
<p>I have made already:</p>
<ul>
<li>more then 50K lines of code to make parts of the game working</li>
<li>200+ pages of content(Fight Card Texts,Effect Cards, Items, Location Descriptions, etc)</li>
<li>2000+ of Art Images(Location Places, Cards, Items, Effects, Unique Armor Parts, etc)</li>
<li>300+ Sounds related to Fight;</li>
<li>and a lot of other things(databases, item structures with all the data)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this things I made ALONE. Yeap, friends say that I'm a fanatic.</p>
<p>And YES, I am ready to finish what I have started. I have a storyline, a raw content to work with, the skills to write the story, code, draw an Art, but I am really need <i>your  </i>help. I have only two hands. Content is a very time-consuming part. It would be impossible to work on the Project and have additional  work to pay the bills. That's why I am here and asking for your help. Using your support I will be able to finish on the biggest projects I will work on. If the Second Goal will be reached I could use some extra help. Having more human power I will be able to concentrate on the story you will get.</p>
<p>My final goal: ""kids"" should get the game at the end.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The project runs under ZERO marketing budget. Usually the games you see (you know who we speaking about) spend half of the project budget for this(included to price you pay) . I want you pay for content you get, not for advertising. So, if you able to share the link - I will be more then happy for your help! Just copy a link to project or use  Indiegogo Share Tools, it will help a lot!</p>

</div></div>","I’m offering you a dark fantasy story with secrets and details that are not always visible at first sight. The story will be written no matter you are involved in events or not. But you will have an opportunity to participate in it and bring it into your sight. The basic idea: you are not a super hero, who is able to change whole world, but you will have an opportunity to change the outcome of events. You are a cogwheel which will behave well or badly. Also you will have a wide set of battles - an important part of the game. So, move on.
small hint:  if you don't want to read the details about every part of the game, just scroll down page and look the screens. It will help you to understand the game briefly
The game format is an old book with illustrations. The second part of the game is the game board where you have to make measured steps. The board where the tactical part takes place. A chessboard-like type, to be more precise. 
Third part is playing cards. Yes, old paper playing cards with illustrations. 
Summing all these things up, we can have some picture. Yes, it’s unclear (yet). We will fix it soon.
We have a book with a story, we are free to move where we want (and we will have many opportunities there), we take parts in events (or don’t, everything will have an affect on the story). If we are involved in turmoil (fights), we will have deep interaction on a game (tactics) board with actions and game cards.   Are you still intrigued? Do you want to understand what kind of the story are waiting for you and how it works? Let's talk about each thing in details. 
Some global events that are the foundation of the story have ALREADY happened. The world is huge, but these events had an effect on massive territories and all aspects of life by it’s own kind. Some aspects significantly changed, some ones felt changes less. The main essence - the world has changed, and the inhabitants have adapted to it, some ones had not. The population significantly decreased. There are no inhabitants who passed consequences without a trace.

We are experiencing the world, where the Middle Ages live style is still a base of surviving and total atmosphere, similar to NoMans Lands and Wilds (hello, The Witcher 3!). Meanwhile, past events played a great role (which are related to the story and the plot of the game), which gave a rise for rudiments of the first discoveries (and in some places and not the first) such as mechanics, possibility to use the electricity and the first devices based on it, steam machines, and other stuff.
To clarify a bit what is waiting for you and leave some space to your mind, I will propose an example.
Imagine  “Fallout” world with all it’s technologies, made in past, or Morrowind world with the Dwemers, who have sunk in ages (past events in the game had been not so far ago). But all this story stuff moved to the Middle Ages. One of you might remember Arcanum with magic and technologies, but it will be far from the truth. By the story, there is no opposition between technology and magic. Technology is more like something, that has made an incredible leap and great discoveries. It has become impossible to move this line in the modern world where player take place. The knowledge is lost and there no help to wait from inside with new one. A kind of Post apocalypse in the Middle Ages. As all popular stories like, humanity had not been mutilated beyond recognition. But big changes have come (including weather). You have to find out what happened and choose your own way through this difficult world environment.
Many of you can say: Why do you just not tell the basic story? I have an answer – you have to find what is going on in this world and the main plot. Every detail will give you a spoiler of the key of the story moments.
 
This story is about the world and events, but not about specific heroes. Nevertheless, the game will have many unique picturesque characters with its dark stories. All of these individuals who found a place in this world has its own interests, and you have to act with them ... or not.
I can’t say for sure at this moment, but we have a plan to implement Afterword for each character you met (as in Fallout with settlements). The decision to make it will depend on the achieved goals of the Project.


All of us want to walk in an interesting world to look at spellbinding corners of the lands (whether it's the Huge Old Town with large half empty quarters and haunted interiors or it is ruins of an abandoned tower with its secrets, or the smoggy swamps, the Deep Forests where the light can barely break through).That was small spoiler for you. It’s your choice where you want to go.Every of this part will depend on several factors. First, your desire to explore the Lands (this possibility will be provided). Second, your advertency (as a player) will give you a chance to reveal hidden terrains (or set of character parameters will help you).
There will be many hidden actions in the game. If your character can't find them yet (not enough skills), you can do it by yourself using text input (as in Fallout 1 or Leisure Suit Larry).This is not a mandatory part of the gameplay. Therefore, by carefully reading the story, you will be rewarded with advanced features. These actions can lead you to hidden events, locations, valuable things, etc.
As a result, for example, there will be moments when you can see the Spot in the fields traveling at night, which can lead to a band of bandits ... either to discover a hidden path…or cave in a bush behind a bridge.., or climb onto a ledge that the Book basically does not offer you. Meanwhile, you have to understand, each of your actions can lead not just to a new path or location, but to a danger with the next series of events that you hastily decided to touch. You can’t say for sure where it brings you. Maybe you will end up in the beast den and become its dinner. Whether you have to climb over the ledge, and, if you are missing the appropriate items, you break a leg and remain as lame until the end of the game ... I am joking of course. Realism is good, but we are not interested to make you stumbling with the cane through the whole storyline.
So, your choices can lead you to Events, to New Territories, to Details of the story. Or you will get some type of experience in different forms ( Perks that can be used in other events). The basic idea - the book will give you some uncovered basic interaction mechanics, other part will depend on you and your character. So, the second part will lead you to facilitation of advancement on the story line path. If you want to go straight without exploring the details, at some point of the story you will start to understand: It was worthwhile to look into that draw-well, which you did not like and have to see what it would lead to. Perhaps your life will become even harder after that or… maybe you will get something valuable or learn something that will give you an access to new events and introduce new book characters.
Let admit small benefits about this part of the game. The game provides markers (hello, Witcher 3). If you have visited a key area in the book, the game will mark this place on your map, so that means you do not need to thumb half of the book to get to this place. The terrain is divided on three types of levels. Territories, Locations, and Sublocations. The Territory is a place on the global map (the Big area). Such territory has its own map (illustrated Page in the book) where Locations are marked (Locations that you discovered already). Every location has its own schematic map to give you an basic idea what you may discover here (Sublocations). Sublocations are the minimal main movement part where the player takes place.

In most cases, it will be an illustrated page with the terrain and your simple set of actions (moves) ... and additional details with hints such as sets of phrases (which can give you a completely new experience about this place). Or it can be explicit direct Actions (indicated by additional illustrations). They are leading to series of new events (a simple example, encounter with a traveler who is passing by on the road).
 
To get a better idea how it looks like, let's take another example: Territory: Eastern District near the City, Terrain: near the Weeping Forest, Sublocation: Road Fork.
Here our actions take place like our minimal unit of choice. Whether we want to go - to the village through the fields, or whether we should go straight down the tract towards the old farm, making our way to the city walls along the forest. Or we can notice a small detail: that the branches of the forest are strangely unnaturally moving… you are now getting involved in some new adventure and event proceeding to a remote forest, if you want to, of course.  Each such action has its own price of time.
Any movement takes some period. Walking a couple of hundred meters along the path to the next location will cost you a couple of minutes. For example, if you are making some active action, like talking with a traveler, you begin to understand that person is a hostile and will hit you next moment using knife, you should to make a choice…, or the choice will be made by the  book considering to situation. There will be actions in certain moments when you need to make a decision quickly. This is not a static story with the “Next” button, where you can go to take a cup of tea for 10 minutes and nothing will happen with your character like a random encounter on the road while you are just standing, or flock wolves passing through will not try to hunt on you.
There will be action scenes when your enemy will not wait until you make a choice.
Of course, in most of the moments you can safely hide in some abandoned building to have some rest or craft some sort of extract or just to study materials about a creature you have to fight with. All the actions are described in details; there will be no feeling like you ""are teleported"" from one location to another. If your path is laying from forest to village, the Book will give you a description how you should get there (besides the description of the location itself); if you are moving in the opposite direction, from village to the Forest, there will be absolutely new description of you path, because you see different objects on the way back. ""I chose the action and it seems like something happened"" - this is not about this Book. You will have enough description what is going on not to feel yourself ""hollow"" in the vastness of the story.


Since we are talking about time and it’s directly related to your actions, it worths mentioning some additional details. Real daytime will visually effect on the illumination of the Book for greater immersion in, is not just an aesthetic aspect. Time of day, weather (snow, rain, clear weather) – all of these can effect the world around us. As an example, you can see at night what you have not seen at daytime on the same path. Or you will not notice the path under your nose to the right, or walk along the familiar to you road under the cover of darkness, trying to get to the hut. The game will throw you in situation when you accidentally turn wrong way and find yourself in another place, where you would not ever get under any of other circumstances.
 
Let’s remember now that our character is an ordinary person and he has his needs like food, drink (don’t worry, eating and drinking will work automatically. Your character is not so stupid so you have to do everything for him, this stuff will work like in Mount & Blade. The main thing – character should have something to eat in his backpack). Fatigue is key parameter of you character (important in the skirmishes), cold and heat (it is a bad idea to wander in bad weather without a certain equipment). Eventually you may find out that you have pneumonia that will not pass by itself. All of these effect your character state, a possibility to fight in skirmishes and even in simple interactions (if you have a broken leg, this will not make your life easier in combat or in movement). That is a big cascade ecosystem of your character, which affect on your opportunities and will be available for you.
Oh yes, we forgot to add an important thing about exploring. Depending on your choice in the game and achieved project's goals, you will be able to explore the world with company. There will be characters in the game who will be able to join you, but you do not need to travel together. You can split your characters into parties and wander around the world. So, how it works.
If you have more than one party, you can play one party at once, at other parties you can do some stuff (moving to distant territories, craft some items, rest, etc. like in Jagged Alliance 2). Depending on your goals in the Project, you will have a possibility to give some extended job to your party (searching for simple resources, ingredients, hunting, etc.). So you will be able to switch between parties any time and proceed the story in another part of the game world. But you should remember that most of your actions take time and the time goes simultaneously for everyone for every party. You may encounter a situation when you have to choose where to go (intercept some character in different places) so that is an idea to separate party to check few places at once. Also there will be different situations where probably better to have all the characters or only one, as complex parameters can be used to achieve the goal (bigger one, lower one or medium). The game can give a challenge where you can suffer comprehensively; or there will be an action where some special Perk should be used and I will miss some opportunities because you will not have such a character in a current party. The choice is yours.
As a characters getting some perks during the game, one party will get them, the second one will not (although in certain moments that is for good). After all, some Perks can be useful and some can be harmful or just unwanted.


Let’s talk about the experience. There is no experience in the Book as it is usual for games. Each action can bring you something of its own. You can get hurt or disease, you can hint certain detail in the dialogue - you will get a Perk that will improve or reduce one of parameters of your character; also you can do something bad and the character will get a Perk that can play negative  role on some of events.
It’s worth to notice about one of the game key points - about the status of your characters. You will have a basic set of characteristics at the start and probably this will be the best state of your characters unlike the entire length of the game.
Of course these things can be different but the world is harsh and the ambient environment is not friendly to you.
The world will try to harm you during the story. Depending on the events, you will receive a lot of Effects that will obviously have a negatively effect on you. So it’s better to take care about it (although the choice is yours).
In addition, you will have the back side of the medal - learned skills and knowledge (as Perks, the direct parameter increase, knowledge of alchemy and craft, knowledge about strong and weak creatures’ sides, combat skills, enemy behavior). You will get all of these during the world exploration process. It will compensate negative aspects affected on you in the world. Both of these sides will be present simultaneously. Which side will grow faster depends on you.
 

Final key moment regarding to territory exploration is our favorite part in all of the games- items that you can be found. There will be no useless garbage in the Book - no forks, plates, caps furniture, etc. for sale (sorry, Skyrim). There will be useful items for some actions (ropes, shovels, hooks, winches, etc.), things needed for craft (like elixirs, salves, powders, other useful items and devices, armor and weapons, depending on stretch goals achieved in the Project), food, valuable stuff worth to be sold.
Item looting and searching also look like a set of actions, a kind of mini quests. That will depend on your skills needed for research or on your advertency (as a player).
For example, you have found an abandoned shack and you want to loot it. The book will give you the opportunity to loot all the stuff  with your naked eye (for example, the Old Shovel, standing in the corner of the shack). But you have to make a closer look with certain skills  to find something special…,or you should read the description of the shack carefully that will give a chance to find a closet or cellar which will lead to something hidden from prying eyes. Perhaps you will need the strength to move the cabinet and get into a hidden shelter with a useful object.
Thereby you will never be able to say for sure if you have learned everything at some place.  This will lead an opportunity to return here later after getting some information from a particular character or when you become more experienced in research.
Items price and about items themself.

Items will be expensive to buy (sorry, Witcher 3, no bags of gold). This part of the world is lack of supplies. There were better times, but not right now. Most of found items will be not in the best condition (some items will require additional actions before they can be used). To not get into spoilers, some of items will not have magical origin but they do not belong to the Middle Ages stuff. Meanwhile that does not mean that there's a place for high tech fiction items.
If you do not have an opportunity to buy something, you can always try to find it, but it will cost your time and, in addition, a danger related to search, there will be a risk of getting negative effects for the character (as I hinted before, not immediately reveals themselves).
Again, in order to not get into spoilers, I’ll give you a small hint - there will be no packs of Zombies like in Walking Dead TV series. There will be no deadly virus that struck humanity. I can say only one thing, that some events of the past has affected the emergence and spread all known large city medieval disease of (I think you know which one is).
This is not a key event and not a main issue of this world, but it has been already woven into the story and it has took place a bit earlier. So, let’s go back to item search. You will have a risk of getting some negative effects in some places (Disease or Mental effect in the form of depression after you have seen something).
This loot is cheap for your pocket, but perhaps you will have to pay for it by your health. You should deal with it anyway (as it was told before, the Book will not let you understand immediately that you got this effect; this is a kind of SaveLoad AntiCheat system. You will learn about what you get when the time passes. Many of the negative effects have ""incubation time"", so you'll be wondering where you got it). Of course, you can always kill someone. That is the favorite part. You think you have prepared for such actions? Now we are going directly to the combat system.


Perhaps some of the readers will find the Tactical and Combat Part a bit difficult. Let us say you are right. That is only at first sight. It becomes nice and clear when you will be dedicated to details.
All the moments are made to ensure that each player have a wide range of choice in combat.
So, let's speak about it more closely.
The game board is represented as a game table with sectors for cards. Each such sector, as like as a chessboard, is the place for the figure (the card in our case). Meaning figure we mean a character, creature or ordinary humanoid enemy. You are free to walk on any of these cells, approaching to or retiring from enemies.
In turn-based mode each unit has a certain number of action points and turns. These turns are movement on the board, Close Combat card use, inventory use, using an active item, or using Effect Cards (Mental Attacks, etc.). You can decide how you will spend your action points using the position of units on the board.
You may ask why the tactical part is important. Let's be more detailed: Each unit has its own unique set of characteristics that affect its State and its danger (as in any game). Each unit has body parts that have their own state, armor (different protection from slash, blunt and piercing damage, etc.). Armor has a state, either does the body part. All of these parameters affect their effectiveness.
Each unit (critters are exceptions, they have their own specifics) has its own set of weapons which affects the abilities of its combat like sets of Close Combat Cards. In addition, this has an effect on ability to conduct offensive and defensive combat depending on the type of unit weapons.
Each unit has a set of knowledge about these Close Combat Cards. This will have an effect on its defensive abilities too.
Depending on unit smartness, he can remember/forget the Close Combat cards used against him. This will give a chance to better repel of attack.
Depending on the character smartness, he will try to use the best card against you (no Random, the probabilities are calculated with the maximum damage against the enemy on the game board)
By the way, there are many ways to effect these mental abilities using Effect Cards, such as Intimidation, Confusion, Panic, or make a character frenzy and attacks everyone on a board. There will be many Effect Cards to learn by completing game events.
Some weapons can cause specific damage as well as Effect Cards.
To make a decision who you want to hit next, you can use any of the proposed choices. Just get a closer enemy to use max action points or you can be a bit smarter. You can use knowledge of Battle Almanac against a particular creature (the similarity of the Witcher Bestiary). You can use the View of the available details of your enemy (detailed information will be available depend on your skills, how good your knowledge is with certain enemy)   Once you have determined your opponent, you are ready to choose Close Fight Card.

What is a Close Fight Card and how does it work.
A Close Fight Card is a set of punches for certain parts of the body. You should decide which parts of the body should be damaged first so that the enemy becomes weaker or more vulnerable, or stops the action which you do not need. Like W.A.T.S. system in Fallout but with sets of punches.

Each card has a basic version of the strike with certain hit belonged to one of the body parts (up to the 4th level of study).
Depending on the knowledge level of this card, you can use such card for one action. This action produce up to four hits to opponent (for certain body parts).
Depending on your skills (one-handed, two-handed, clubs, etc.), each hit will spend your total number of action points (restored to some level with each new move based on your fatigue and basic characteristics).
Looks difficult, isn’t it? Only At first glance!
Let's use an example to explain how this works.
You are attacked by an enemy with a sword. This is an experienced opponent and he knows some Close Fight Card used with sword. He have studied such card to a 3rd level. Accordingly to knowledge level, he is ready to perform 3 hits on body parts provided by this Fighting Card. But you do not know witch parts of the body enemy will try to hit. Now we are going to the most interesting part of the fight.
How do you protect yourself in this case? Forget about boring static card battles, about the QTE system like insane button push. It will be a short fight which lasts up to half a minute, but you’ll have to think fast.
Every hit scene divided to 3 stages.
First one, the opponent will throw you a card with the first hit flavored with a driving battle
music and attacking screams. The game has more than 600 combat sounds generated for each action set depending on the type of character and damage. You will not be bored to listen the same sounds every time.
If the Card is familiar to you (your character already learned this card), you will see a unique picture with an attack pose and a text symbolizing actions of this attack.
If you are well prepared for a battle, your associative logic (based on the visual perception of the picture and the unique text for each strike) will remember where the hit strikes. You can choose which part of the body should be protected by throwing your defend card.
You will see generated Unknown Special Card - you are unfamiliar with this hit and you will have to guess how to defend yourself. Of course, it will seem a bit difficult in the beginning.
The character needs to know this card, you should remember the picture and text related to a hit. But this is only at the first moments of the game. The more you play, the less hard it will be.
In addition, you have other possibilities to simplify the fight. For example, with having good advertency and reaction you will have more time to decide how you should defend yourself.  Or by using a Special Help Card that will guide you which side of attack you should wait . This will simplify your fight several times. Also, having a shield (depends on the size of the shield)  your choice can be simplified up to two or three choices like to block entire left side of the body or the entire right side.
You should keep in mind that the shields consume a lot of stamina and limited durability. Your action points are restored depending on stamina too. You will have to choose what is more important for you at the moment.
So, that was the second stage called SLO MO. During listening the sound of slow heartbeat you have to make a choice how to fend off an attack.  After the choice has been made, the game will change the rhythm of the music to series of attacks. Further, everything will depend on many parameters of the characters involved in close fight.
The third stage is a result of your choice. You will get Result Card based on your actions with general text which will describe what happened.
Not so difficult, right?
Such an action will be iterated as many times as knowledge level of Card attacker has (and…the action points spent to card, up to four).
After last hit lasts, you can calmly consider the details: the injuries received by each punch; perhaps even details like the enemy was more experienced in weapon skill, quicker or more agile. So you can make a conclusion which tactic to choose next time: change weapon style, etc.  Also you can read Almanac to find out how the opponent is capable of…. If you stay alive, of course. After that, you will return to the tactical board until you win (or lose) the fight.


In addition to the characteristics and skills of your character, player should have some skills too (symbiosis of the player's knowledge and his character). That is the main idea of the card game. You are using your character like an avatar with his own capabilities but your skills as a player is very important too. So the character is a killing machine and you are part of it. If you have played some fighting game, then you should know: each character has its own fight tactic: set of techniques to defend and attack. Every unit has weak and strong sides.
Of course you able to miss a couple of kicks if you have good armor or you are mighty kid with magnificent health. Such fight system provides many opportunities to play as a thief without armor or as a heavy tank. Everyone has its own bonuses like speed, critical hits and so on. So, flimsy thief can bring you notable damage (till you hit him a couple of times). All of these things work in the opposite situation too. Character characteristics, weapon weight, the Close Fight Cards, Effect Cards -  no sense to describe all the list of possibilities you will have. There will be a detailed manual for this part.
Few last extra details: you can use two-handed weapons as one-handed (if you have enough strength). Also there is no limit to have two-handed weapon in each of hand, but keep in mind – weapon weight affects endurance.
Knowledge and Learning.
Everything can be learned and every action has counteraction. If you have learned many Cards, you will have many rooms for fighting. If you have studied a certain group of creatures, then you know weak and strong enemy sides. You will gain an advantage on the battlefield. The Witcher game Bestiary could be more useful, because it has a great potential. We will fix this part of the game in our Book and will make it your best friend in surviving. If you are strong in crafting or brewing, you have wide space to protect yourself or improve your characteristics, or get rid of some effects. Some of knowledge you learn thanks to completing Events; some of knowledge you will learn during the battle, some of knowledge you can simply buy for money.

The book is initially aimed to the medical side. Such knowledge and visual art has a significant component as does an element of the game.  
If you are intrigued let's move to the goals and I will show you what you get
 
 
 
Goals

Most the game content, which has been already done, is related to the final goal. So we do not even think to cut something just because we won't be able to deliver it in the StoryLine
The project is huge and  nothing happens from the air(Alas!). So it takes time. Development period about 3 years(that is standart time for a huge game with huge content). 
In my opinion, better to wait a bit to get good game at the end unlike do not wait nothing at all,right?
I hope you share this  
Project costs overview

 
 
Rewards
In game NPC: one of the NPC will get your lineament.

The main idea:  if you are speaking with such NPC you will see full size page with the face.
By clicking on such Face you will be able to move to Facebook page(if you like) and people will see the Prototype of the NPC(You). So, maybe one of the NPC is your friend or neighbor :)  
We have common character reward or key character reward. The key character is a person which you will see more often in the game.
Sponsor Reward:
Your name on the first page of the Book: Every time the people open Main Menu they will see your name(by hitting the name you can  move to FB page to look at the person ). If you do not want the link,we will disable it.

 
Titles reward
Your name in titles.We will have to sections of the Titles:Disbelievers Section:This option for people who want to say the word like : ""I TOLD YOU!""
Maybe you don't beleive in the project quality(or something else)  and want to say the world that you was Right!(Perhaps you are a true predictor? Let the people know!)
Believers Section: Maybe you just want to help the project but not interested in the game...or If you haven't enough money(I hope you are OK)
 

Risks & Challenges
Just a few words. One of my character traits is ""Saying the Truth no metter how much it will cost"". So, I will say you as it is.
I am working on the project for two years(29 of May was 2 years date).
I have made already:

more then 50K lines of code to make parts of the game working
200+ pages of content(Fight Card Texts,Effect Cards, Items, Location Descriptions, etc)
2000+ of Art Images(Location Places, Cards, Items, Effects, Unique Armor Parts, etc)
300+ Sounds related to Fight;
and a lot of other things(databases, item structures with all the data)

All of this things I made ALONE. Yeap, friends say that I'm a fanatic.
And YES, I am ready to finish what I have started. I have a storyline, a raw content to work with, the skills to write the story, code, draw an Art, but I am really need your  help. I have only two hands. Content is a very time-consuming part. It would be impossible to work on the Project and have additional  work to pay the bills. That's why I am here and asking for your help. Using your support I will be able to finish on the biggest projects I will work on. If the Second Goal will be reached I could use some extra help. Having more human power I will be able to concentrate on the story you will get.
My final goal: ""kids"" should get the game at the end.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
The project runs under ZERO marketing budget. Usually the games you see (you know who we speaking about) spend half of the project budget for this(included to price you pay) . I want you pay for content you get, not for advertising. So, if you able to share the link - I will be more then happy for your help! Just copy a link to project or use  Indiegogo Share Tools, it will help a lot!",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>the story of rocklegend.</h3>
<p><a href=""http://rocklegend.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rocklegend</a> is a free online music game. If you like games like Guitar Hero, Rockband, Frets on Fire or the legendary Jamlegend, you'll love rocklegend.</p><p>We're working with artists to get them onboard, and are also talking to labels in order to create a diverse song catalogue.</p><p>It all started back in October 2013 when Patrick, the founder and developer of rocklegend decided that the time for a new online music game has finally come. He started developing the core of rocklegend.</p>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135142/files/20150106134555-Bildschirmfoto_2015-01-06_um_22.23.40.png?1420580755"" src="""" style=""width: 349.317697228145px; height: 381px;""/></p>
<p><i>This was the very first version of the rocklegend player (nostalgia ;))</i></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Ftb7nWwYMpVI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dtb7nWwYMpVI&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Ftb7nWwYMpVI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>In March 2014 Michael, a good friend of Patrick and a marketing and sales expert joined the project and is now Co-Founder of rocklegend. He started talking with bands and labels, and now, we have a catalogue of 17 artists and 56 songs (growing)! </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135269/files/20150106152451-Bildschirmfoto_2015-01-07_um_00.23.48.png?1420586691"" src="""" style=""width: 557.516059957174px; height: 460px;""/></p>
</div>
<p>Now, more than a year has passed an it's been exciting to see how this project grew from a little side project to a project which has many fans and passionate players.</p>
<p></p><p>We went through a closed alpha in which about 1.000 Users joined us and started playing around with the track editor, and later began to battle for highscores!</p><p>On the 30th November 2014 we opened <a href=""http://rocklegend.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rocklegend</a> for everyone, and in just one month, more than 500 users joined us already and are playing the game :)</p>We went through a closed alpha in which about 1.000 Users joined us and started playing around with the track editor, and later began to battle for highscores!<div>
<br/><h3>what's next, and what do we need?</h3>
<p>We're currently at a point where we got the basic mechanics of the game done, a growing user base and lots of ideas. The current design of the rocklegend website and game was made by a developer (Patrick) and it's main purpose was to make ""feature"" tests possible for the closed alpha phase of the project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135277/files/20150106152716-Bildschirmfoto_2015-01-07_um_00.26.47.png?1420586836"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It doesn't look great, and implementing new stuff into the current website is a pain (navigation structure is horrible, everything looks different, it doesn't have a ""game"" - feel).</p>
<p><b>We want to pay a designer to create the new screen- &amp; player-design for rocklegend.</b></p>
<p>This is going to help us with a few things:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>the website is going to be faster, due to the new way we are going to code and deliver the new version</li>
<li>new features can be implemented more quickly</li>
<li>a consistent design where nothing looks out of place</li>
<li>new player style will allow custom designs</li>
<li>rocklegend is going to look better than ever!</li>
</ul>
<p><i>For this we need $ 4.250,-. This includes costs for perks, payment to indiegogo and the payment provider. There's also a small amount reserved to be safe if something we didn't think about comes up.</i></p>
<p>
<b style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">We want to implement a ton of new features.</b>
</p>
<p>Since the stuff you see on rocklegend.org is just the beginning, there's a lot of planned features coming to rocklegend in 2015.</p>
<p>If you help us to raise more than the $ 4.250,- we need for the screendesign, it will allow us to <i><b>speed up the development</b></i> of these things:</p>
<p><b>6.000 $ - </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">multiplayer mode - play against friends or strangers in realtime</span></p>
<p><b>10.000 $ - </b>a revolutionary fan/experience system. realtime competition between all players. you can win and loose fans. some people say it reminds them of bitcoins system.</p>
<p><b>12.000 $ </b>- performance recording. got a great score? post it on youtube without opening a screen-recording tool!</p>
<p><b>25.000 $ - </b>rocklegend mobile. keep playing rocklegend anywhere you want.</p>
<p><b>50.000 $ - </b>""Beat-Legend"". Upload your songs, play them instantly with automatic track conversion.</p>
<p>And there's also a few other things we're going to implement this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>moderation system - mods will keep the community an awesome place to be.</li>
<li>improved managament and communication system for trackers</li>
<li>improved track editor to make it easier, faster and more fun to create tracks</li>
<li>improved player: custom designs, performance improvements</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Yes, there's going to be premium content.</b></div>
<div>Keeping rocklegend online costs money. We thought a lot about how to implement a business model which won't block anyone and found a way to provide additional content, which is not pay to win, for users who like rocklegend and want to get the most out of it.</div>
<div>Examples for premium content:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>High Quality Audio</li>
<li>Special Emoticons</li>
<li>Custom Designs</li>
<li>Special Venues (this has to do with our upcoming fan system)</li>
<li>Custom Playlists</li>
<li>Private Chat rooms</li>

<h3>risks and challenges</h3>
<div>We love this project, and therefore we are not going to quit working on it :)</div>
<div>We know how much we have to pay for our designers and we know what they are capable of - therefore the risk of not getting a design done (or the design is not good enough) is extremely small.</div>
<div>There are known risks for:</div>
<div>- stretch goal: video recording. it's possible that we need to redevelop the whole player in order to make this work. </div>
<div>- stretch goal: beat legend. it's possible that there's going to be much more effort to implement this system. we already have a few working demos though and are dedicated to implement this feature since it's something we'd love to use too.</div>
<div>We're very communicative, so if you have any ideas, or want to help us in any way - you can write us a mail to office@rocklegend.org anytime!</div>

</div></div>","Do you have what it takesto be a rocklegend?
We need you, to help us build the best music game ever.You can already play the open beta here: rocklegend.org !A free to play music game, right in your browser (and later on your mobile phone too!). You can play when you want, where you want and what you want!
the story of rocklegend.
rocklegend is a free online music game. If you like games like Guitar Hero, Rockband, Frets on Fire or the legendary Jamlegend, you'll love rocklegend.We're working with artists to get them onboard, and are also talking to labels in order to create a diverse song catalogue.It all started back in October 2013 when Patrick, the founder and developer of rocklegend decided that the time for a new online music game has finally come. He started developing the core of rocklegend.


This was the very first version of the rocklegend player (nostalgia ;))

In March 2014 Michael, a good friend of Patrick and a marketing and sales expert joined the project and is now Co-Founder of rocklegend. He started talking with bands and labels, and now, we have a catalogue of 17 artists and 56 songs (growing)! 



Now, more than a year has passed an it's been exciting to see how this project grew from a little side project to a project which has many fans and passionate players.
We went through a closed alpha in which about 1.000 Users joined us and started playing around with the track editor, and later began to battle for highscores!On the 30th November 2014 we opened rocklegend for everyone, and in just one month, more than 500 users joined us already and are playing the game :)We went through a closed alpha in which about 1.000 Users joined us and started playing around with the track editor, and later began to battle for highscores!
what's next, and what do we need?
We're currently at a point where we got the basic mechanics of the game done, a growing user base and lots of ideas. The current design of the rocklegend website and game was made by a developer (Patrick) and it's main purpose was to make ""feature"" tests possible for the closed alpha phase of the project.


It doesn't look great, and implementing new stuff into the current website is a pain (navigation structure is horrible, everything looks different, it doesn't have a ""game"" - feel).
We want to pay a designer to create the new screen- & player-design for rocklegend.
This is going to help us with a few things:


the website is going to be faster, due to the new way we are going to code and deliver the new version
new features can be implemented more quickly
a consistent design where nothing looks out of place
new player style will allow custom designs
rocklegend is going to look better than ever!

For this we need $ 4.250,-. This includes costs for perks, payment to indiegogo and the payment provider. There's also a small amount reserved to be safe if something we didn't think about comes up.

We want to implement a ton of new features.

Since the stuff you see on rocklegend.org is just the beginning, there's a lot of planned features coming to rocklegend in 2015.
If you help us to raise more than the $ 4.250,- we need for the screendesign, it will allow us to speed up the development of these things:
6.000 $ - multiplayer mode - play against friends or strangers in realtime
10.000 $ - a revolutionary fan/experience system. realtime competition between all players. you can win and loose fans. some people say it reminds them of bitcoins system.
12.000 $ - performance recording. got a great score? post it on youtube without opening a screen-recording tool!
25.000 $ - rocklegend mobile. keep playing rocklegend anywhere you want.
50.000 $ - ""Beat-Legend"". Upload your songs, play them instantly with automatic track conversion.
And there's also a few other things we're going to implement this year:

moderation system - mods will keep the community an awesome place to be.
improved managament and communication system for trackers
improved track editor to make it easier, faster and more fun to create tracks
improved player: custom designs, performance improvements

Yes, there's going to be premium content.
Keeping rocklegend online costs money. We thought a lot about how to implement a business model which won't block anyone and found a way to provide additional content, which is not pay to win, for users who like rocklegend and want to get the most out of it.
Examples for premium content:

High Quality Audio
Special Emoticons
Custom Designs
Special Venues (this has to do with our upcoming fan system)
Custom Playlists
Private Chat rooms


legendary perks
Most of the perks are pretty self-explanatory :)



All badges will be awarded by the end of the campaign

Premium content will be available in late 2015.
Guitar picks and drumsticks will be delivered in april/may 2015.


At higher perk levels you get a pair of rocklegend signature drumsticks or a rocklegend signature pick!

This is our template for the picks:






This is a preview of how the drumsticks are planned to look like:

You may tell us if you have any strength preferences for the picks!

risks and challenges
We love this project, and therefore we are not going to quit working on it :)
We know how much we have to pay for our designers and we know what they are capable of - therefore the risk of not getting a design done (or the design is not good enough) is extremely small.
There are known risks for:
- stretch goal: video recording. it's possible that we need to redevelop the whole player in order to make this work. 
- stretch goal: beat legend. it's possible that there's going to be much more effort to implement this system. we already have a few working demos though and are dedicated to implement this feature since it's something we'd love to use too.
We're very communicative, so if you have any ideas, or want to help us in any way - you can write us a mail to office@rocklegend.org anytime!

ex-jamlegend player?We have a thread in our forums where you can post your previous username and clan from the old jamlegend days: http://forum.rocklegend.org/index.php?p=/discussion/11/calling-all-jamlegend-players

<h3>Features</h3>The feature this whole thing is about: <b>Profiles</b>. With it, you can define custom resolution/dpi/over-scan to be applied right before launching the app/game you want. Just draw the app gesture to launch it with the aforementioned profile. You can draw it anywhere over any app/game/window opened or even on your home screen. Just tap ""Dotty"" and draw your gesture.

It has to be done with style!We've gathered more than <b>150 themes</b> for our little Dotty to suit everyone's styles.

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p></p>  
When you open our application, you'll see one screen with three tabs: 
Settings/Gestures/ and Themes. In Gestures tab, you can ad new custom 
gesture to your list:<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450895987/oxkl1dp4yujjtsqsdequ.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>After
 clicking ""Add new gesture"", a new screen will appear, in-which you'll 
draw a gesture of your choice and associate it with a certain app/action
 -and optionally choose custom resolution to be applied before the app 
is opened. Click save and Voila! you're done :)<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450896261/cs7threoahjnr4eq3ilp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Now, you can go anywhere now and click on Dotty (if not visible, get
 it from the notification bar) and draw your gesture ... The action will
 take place immediately! If you no longer need Dotty or just don't want 
it to be visible now, just long click on it and it'll disappear and

<p>Hordes of strange and powerful monsters started invading Earth! But it turns out that Earth wasn’t their only target. The “Dimension Busters”, huge beings that command an army of bizarre creatures, were invading not only Earth, but a lot of different Worlds in different Dimensions too.</p>
<p>An Inter-Dimensional organization to hunt down and dispose of these beings, the DB Hounds, was formed with select warriors from each Dimension, with their base on Planet Earth. Their job is clear: to go to any World that might be being invaded by the Dimension Busters, get rid of them, and recruit any warrior that might be willing to join the fight.</p>
<p>After destroying a Dimension Buster, we can use the remains to extract data about their Prime Dimension, after enough data has been collected we can transport to their own dimension and end this war once and for all!</p>

<p><strong>ARCADE</strong></p>
<p>On every stage, there are many waves of incoming enemies to defeat, using the unique qualities of your character and cooperating with the other players, while evading any hazard that might be in place.</p>
<p>There are power ups and items that will help on surviving the waves, either dropped by the defeated enemies or provided by vending machines.</p>
<p>In the final wave there will be a boss to conquer, much powerful that the other enemies, once it is destroyed the stage will be completed. Clearing a stage will unlock new ones to try and might unlock new playable characters.</p>
<p>The player has a certain level of control about what stage to play next, so the game doesn’t need to be linear.</p>
<p>There are 6 dimensions with 5 stages each, on the final stage of every dimension there will be a Dimension Buster. After defeating all 6, the final boss , the biggest challenge in the game, will be accessible.</p>

<p><strong>CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<p>After any stage is defeated, a special “challenge mode” for that certain stage becomes available. The challenges vary wildly from stage to stage, like dealing with a super hard wave on a single room, replacing every enemy with one harder to kill, only being able to use bombs and all sorts of crazy things!  </p>
<p>These present a new world of challenge for those daring and skilled players that want a harder experience and some characters can only be unlocked by clearing certain challenges.</p>

<p>A special survival mode will be available for certain stages; here the players will face unending waves of monsters and bosses, trying to set a new record. This is the ultimate challenge of the game, as the waves will become progressively harder and eventually much harder than the normal game.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/1d5I05q1Wo8FjVJHfi/giphy.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>

<p>You start with 4 characters and soon you start unlocking more, either by beating a specific level or challenge.</p>

DB Hounds is a 2D coop-oriented action game where you and up to 3 friends fight waves after waves of enemies and destroy huge bosses, unlocking new and interesting characters along the way. With 30 stages, each one with a challenge, and over a dozen of characters to unlock, the game is jam-packed with content to enjoy!  

The Game’s EARLY BETA demo is out right now!  Download it here: https://masked-hero-studio.itch.io/db-hounds

Developer: Masker hero Studio
Platform: PC
Release date: 2019
Players: 1-4
 
 
Hordes of strange and powerful monsters started invading Earth! But it turns out that Earth wasn’t their only target. The “Dimension Busters”, huge beings that command an army of bizarre creatures, were invading not only Earth, but a lot of different Worlds in different Dimensions too.
An Inter-Dimensional organization to hunt down and dispose of these beings, the DB Hounds, was formed with select warriors from each Dimension, with their base on Planet Earth. Their job is clear: to go to any World that might be being invaded by the Dimension Busters, get rid of them, and recruit any warrior that might be willing to join the fight.
After destroying a Dimension Buster, we can use the remains to extract data about their Prime Dimension, after enough data has been collected we can transport to their own dimension and end this war once and for all!

 
Meet some of the NPCs that will guide you on your journey:


 
 
ARCADE
On every stage, there are many waves of incoming enemies to defeat, using the unique qualities of your character and cooperating with the other players, while evading any hazard that might be in place.
There are power ups and items that will help on surviving the waves, either dropped by the defeated enemies or provided by vending machines.
In the final wave there will be a boss to conquer, much powerful that the other enemies, once it is destroyed the stage will be completed. Clearing a stage will unlock new ones to try and might unlock new playable characters.
The player has a certain level of control about what stage to play next, so the game doesn’t need to be linear.
There are 6 dimensions with 5 stages each, on the final stage of every dimension there will be a Dimension Buster. After defeating all 6, the final boss , the biggest challenge in the game, will be accessible.

 
CHALLENGE
After any stage is defeated, a special “challenge mode” for that certain stage becomes available. The challenges vary wildly from stage to stage, like dealing with a super hard wave on a single room, replacing every enemy with one harder to kill, only being able to use bombs and all sorts of crazy things!  
These present a new world of challenge for those daring and skilled players that want a harder experience and some characters can only be unlocked by clearing certain challenges.
 

 
SURVIVAL
A special survival mode will be available for certain stages; here the players will face unending waves of monsters and bosses, trying to set a new record. This is the ultimate challenge of the game, as the waves will become progressively harder and eventually much harder than the normal game.  

 
 
24 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS
You start with 4 characters and soon you start unlocking more, either by beating a specific level or challenge.
Characters are different in many ways: having a distinctive look, health, speed and special recharge rate, however the biggest way characters differentiate from each other are their main attack and special.The main attack is their normal shoot ability, which varies wildy from one character to another and it’s what you will be using the most. The special is a unique ability which can have many different uses, whenever it is for helping the party or disposing of enemies.
 
Here are some of our characters:


6 DIMENSIONS WITH 30 STAGES IN TOTAL
Your mission to terminate Dimension Busters takes you to 6 different dimensions, each with a different look, feel, hazards and set of enemies.
Each dimension has 5 stages, and you don’t have to do them all in order, beating a stage will grant you Data, and as long as you have enough data you can challenge a stage in another dimension, so you have a lot of freedom about progressing through the game!
The Dimensions are:
DB Hounds Base

Lost Island

Forgotten Castle

Mystic Forest

Frozen Palace

Alien Realm

FEARSOME ENEMIES
On every stage you will find wave after wave of dangerous enemies that you will have to defeat to be able to proceed to the next one, some of these critters are simple to deal with and some of them will require you to use certain tactics to crush them!The different dimensions each will have their unique enemies, but you can also find special, “Irregular” version of basic enemies, that adapted to the different worlds, and are both stronger and harder!
Some of our enemies are:

Some examples of irregulars are:

POWERFULL BOSSES
At the end of every world you will find the cause of the calamity, a Dimension Buster, a supreme being. Defeating these is your biggest challenge, and doing so will always reward you with an amazing character!
After defeating all 30 stages and 6 Dimension Busters, you will have enough data to enter their Prime Dimension, and challenge the final and strongest Dimensional Buster in a duel!

Being students from Argentina, publishing the game by ourselves is just completely out of our reach, that’s why we chose crowd funding as the mean to make our dream a reality.
With the money from the campaign we can sustain and devote ourselves full time to the project and finish it in a timely manner, buy new hardware (which we really need), pay for the game’s music and sounds and take care of all the publishing costs.
 
 
There is already a playable beta of the game, so you can try for yourself and see that we are fully capable of reaching our goals.While this is the first commercial project we get our hands on, we are 100% set on making the best product we possibly can and deliver it on time. We have improved tremendously these last years and will hopefully continue to do so.We love videogames, and we love making videogames, so we assure to do our best to make a videogame you can love too!

<h3>A Tale of War</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>The battle rages </strong>and you feel defeat is near. Though countless enemies are slain, still more keep coming. Your mastery of magic, your superhuman combat skills... they are not enough. Weakened, you fall back as the foes advance to deliver the final strike. But they will not win today, for your own legions are finally at hand !</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Warriors thunder into position</strong> and raise their shields between you and the enemy, a wall of steel in harm's way. Elsewhere, heavy cavalry picks up speed and charges into the writhing enemy flank. Expert crossbowmen send screaming bolts into the enemy host and each strikes true. Behind it all, you direct your forces as the tide of battle begins to turn.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Your thirst for vengeance</strong> now takes over. With replenished strength you throw yourself into the fight. Again and again, enemies fall to your deadly blows. Powerful magic crackles and burns. Your emboldened warriors press the attack even more.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Then, suddenly, it is over.</strong> The great host has melted away and the day is yours. As the red mist clears, you prepare to take advantage of another battle won, another step forward in the great struggle...</p>

<h3>What's the Plan ?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This game is currently <strong>a one-man job</strong>. I've come up with the concept, designed, programmed and playtested a working gameplay demo. I have outsourced art and I am fortunate to have friends with Extreme Awesomeness +10 who helped me enormously; without their skill and effort, none of this would be possible.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yet, to make a game like Warleader - Tales of Heroes, it takes more than that. This game requires a team of experienced developers: programmers, artists and designers working full-time to make it happen. And to put that crack team together, <strong>I need your help</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">So far, this project has been <strong>entirely self-funded</strong>. A demo mission is almost ready for release, which will showcase just what a mission in Warleader - Tales of Heroes will look and feel like. The gameplay is pretty much final, the visual effects as well, combat balancing and tuning are in progress and getting there.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Now, <strong>with your help</strong>, we'll build the team that churns out missions and campaigns for you to play. Each campaign will be available to purchase on Steam, one episode at a time, as soon as they are finished. Depending on your contribution, you will receive free early access, Steam keys to the first few chapters, to the first campaign or even to everything we will ever make !</p>

Or maybe a ghostly mount of mist and shadow ? Whatever you prefer.</p>

We put User Experience at the core and center of our focus and attention to deliver a high quality product to our respected user and  ensure they love it and play it for many days to come.   Once upon a time, in a cyber space universe far far away, there was a magical kingdom lead by a legendary King and beautiful Queen. Unfortunately although life in the kingdom appeared blissfully peaceful from the outside, over time the King and Queen inevitably fell out of love due to constant arguements and bickering about who was more powerful, who was the most intelligent, and who was best suited to wear the crown and lead the kingdom. Our beautiful Queen, an insanely smart, super confident leader with a love for her people, and a life long passion for improving life in her kingdom, was a little naive in some aspects of political life, but when angered - you don't want to be the one standing in her way! She is fierce, loyal and skilled with a mace, and her eyebrows are the stuff of legend and are an important tool of expression - one frown can convey a very clear message mere mortals from far and wide.Our legendary King, famous for his leadership and prowess on the battlefield, is as you might expect, a firecely narcissistic character, he's very full of himself and he has an ego the size of a planet. He is as famous for his sword skills in battle, as he is for stopping in front of every shiny reflective surface to flex his muscles and admire his ripped physique.  As are so many kings, ours is brave in a kinda stupid way, in typical male style, he just charges at things because he knows he is too good to be killed in the battlefield, with the view that he is destined for great things and legendary deeds. Throughout the kingdom he's known for saying out loud to anyone who will listen ""I'm the most handsome and most powerful person in this kingdome"".  One day the King and Queen were yet again arguing fiercely and loudly with each other in the throne chamber of the castle, yet again about who did something wrong, who got it right and who should lead the kingdom. But this time the argument ended in the inevitable decision that they should separate, and go their own ways before they did something terrible to each other or their loyal subjects.After years of bickering and arguing, the inevitable happened and they finally decided to go their own ways, to go off and build their own Kingdoms, to engage in epic battles, and finaly prove once and for all, to the each other and their clans, just who really was the strongest, the most intelligent, and the greatest leader in the kingdom.They have been separated and each of them decided to start their own kingdom and build their own empire. At the beginning of the game, you'll are given option the select your side and lead the army of your choice. So now that you know the background of the story let us introduce you to our company, our team, and our technology and why you should join us by backing our campaign and coming along with us on this exciting journey and in turn recieving your personal rewards in the process. Influencer Early Access ProgrammeSo you’ve invested time & effort in developing a loyal community of followers across social media, youtube, forums or blogs?

So to ensure there was no possible risk of either of them claiming the other had gained an unfair advantage in any Battle, they both agreed on common set of rules of engagement and both agreed to play fairly and adhere to the rules at all times. Those rules are: Rule #1Your most valuable asset is the Town Hall, if an attacker destroys an opponents Town Hall, the attacker is considered to be the winner and is awarded the Town Hall Destruction medal (shown above). Rule #2An attacker must to inflict more than 50% damage upon the opponents Kingdom in order to be a winner; if you inflict damage between 50% and 75%, you will also receive the Bronze Medal of honor (shown above). Rule #3Any attacker who inflicts more than 75% damage, and less than 100% damage, will be awarded a Silver medal (shown above). Rule #4Any attacker who inflicts 100% damage, will be awarded the Total Destruction Gold medal; this medal comes with VIP Points which allow you upgrade your VIP status (shown above). Rule #5Depending on the level of  opponent's Town Hall, if you inflict 100% damage within 90 to 120 seconds, you will receive the Rapid Destruction medal, as well as VIP points (shown above). Timing of any damage inflicted is subject to change during updates and are based on a player's feedback. Building your KingdomUpon seperationg, the King and Queen immediately began building their own Kingdoms. They both decided to select an area of land with magical properties, which can rebuild any damaged building (called the Terrain), but before building anything, they have to remove a set of obstacles to then be able to start building.They each soon discovered that building their respective kingdoms was not an easy job, and not one which could be completed alone. They quickly learn that they need help. Luckily a group of resident Goblins offered to join in the challenge, to help remove the many obstacles, and construct new buildings, but would only agree to do this work in return for a Goblins most prized delecacy, magic Clovers, which help Goblins to energize themselves so they can quickly finish the work they undertake for either the King or Queen. The Builder's hutYou will quickly learn that Goblins and Villagers are settled in the builder's hut. Your villagers collect Clovers for the Goblins, to incentivise them to work faster. The Town HallAs you would expect, your Town Hall is your Command Center, everything is centered around your town Hall. The Town Hall is the main building of each kingdom, not only because it is the command center, but also because by upgrading it you can unlock new features, building and knowledge.There is a huge dependency on this building and its level; more importantly, in every battle as soon as you destroy the opponent's Town Hall you get one star and you are considered winner while continuing the remaining battle time making more damages for more stars.During the battle, if attacker destroys your Town Hall, you' lose the battle and if you destroy opponent's Town Hall, you'll win the battle.As you upgrade the Town Hall, you'll unlock new troops and new features.  The BarracksYour Barracks are where you train your troops; you can have more than one depending on the level of your Town Hall. As you play, you can upgrade your Barracks to unlock new Troops and increase the training queue of your barrack. Army CampYour Army Camp is where your trained troop will gather together to get ready for you to take them to the battle. population of your army is controlled by level of your Army Camps; upgrade your Army Camps to increase population of your army. BlacksmithYou'll need to upgrade your troop's Armor and Attack Power; we designed Blacksmith that you can use to upgrade your troops and make your army stronger; as you upgrade your Blacksmith new troops upgrades will become available.  TroopsMighty Knight: He is a narcissistic individual, fond of himself and with big ego. He is the type that will flex his muscles in the mirror. Think Johnny Bravo - type.He is brave in a kinda stupid way - he just charges at things because he knows he is too good to be killed at the battlefield. He is destined for legendary deeds.    Dwarf: He's a dwarf and when you are born a dwarf, there are only couple of occupations you can choose in life - and they all focus on gold and treasures. Started his career as a jeweler but discovered he is way too energetic for life behind the desk. He ditched his job, trained for couple of months, made himself a one-of-a-kind shoes... and became a professional thief. Not many people expect his speed and sneakiness. Those people pay the price.   Paladin: Paladin is a confident character, with an internal need of making world better. She is kinda naive in some aspects of life, but when angered - don't stand in her way!Fierce, loyal to her Queen and skilled with her mace (seriously, this thing is HEAVY). Her brows are important tool of expression (think: Emilia Clarke reference).  Red: sometimes called Redei, Oh, what a nice child you are! Where is your mum? Oh, you are all by yourself here? Please be careful. Have this candy, bye! Wait, where is my wallet? You'd never suspect her and that's her selling point. She knows her assets and she knows her business. I know, I know, children are growing too fast these days. And they are way too clever.She is still a kid though. She has a weak spot for long midday naps and stuffed toy animals.Her favorite are dogs and wolves.  Ranger:  Ranger is one of those girls that always bump into something. You know, the one that will always have bruises on her elbows and knees, knock the polka-patterned vase you like and smash your mug that you kinda liked but not that much. The fact that her fringe is obscuring her eyes might be a factor.She loves animals and can befriend beasts that would scare others. She's the outdoor type.  Viking: “Sweet girl that you don't want to cross” would be probably the best description. She likes pretty dresses, makeup and flowers but her occupation as warrior prevents her from manifesting this as much as she would like to.She's tough and reliable for her friends. And, boy, she can really swing that hammer of hers!The bear's name is Bojo and people are joking he should have been born a panda bear - he likes to munch on veggies and is kinda slow. Watch out during a fight though!   Barbarian: Not very intelligent, this one. You can kinda tell when looking at his face. Big forehead, small eyes, forward jaw. He should have been born in times where muscles were all that mattered (so, I guess, 80s?). He likes crude clothes and jewelry, preferably made from parts of his dead enemies. Only one thing was able to penetrate his thick skull and discover the fragile heart within - it happened the moment he saw the Viking for the first time.      Wrecker: Wrecker is...ah, hard to describe. It's not that he likes destroying things, nothing simple and crude like that. I guess he is just very angry at, well, most of the world.He's not young but his speed and toughness will surprise you. He is like the living memory of this old neighbor that you were underestimating and making fun of while being a kid until you accidentally hit his window while playing.You know what this big, green guy says? ""That's my secret, I'm always angry"".I think it fits Wrecker very much.    Boomer:  Sweets is the girl that dresses as if Halloween is a year-round event. She's in love with candy-themed stuff, cute dresses, striped stockings, bright colored hair...oh, and explosives.Mind you, she likes her explosions to be pretty too. That's why she spends a lot of time designing them so you really want to keep the distance from her workshop. The New Year fireworks are majestic though. And she's not crazy, if that is what first look is telling you. She's just...very focused on things that sparkle and have potential to destroy a city. Dragon and Squire: Young, scared of his steed (hey, it’s a dragon!), inexperienced. Big front teeth. He is a squire of the Knight. Looks up to the Knight and wants to be like him, despite already handling much more (he is riding a DRAGON, remember?). Knight is very happy with the fact that the Squire admires him and wants to keep it that way. He will show the Squire (mostly useless) tricks like throwing his sword up in the air and catching it (barely). Squire would sit on the grass and his eyes would be all shiny because Knight is such a hero for him. Knight is afraid of the dragon, that’s why he makes Squire do the job. He will never admit that Squire is doing it great, because he wants to keep Squire admiration - it feeds his vanity, so Squire doesn’t really believe in himself.The Dragon - angry, mean beast. It will use every opportunity to try to escape or play a trick on the Squire, because it thinks he’s annoying. Much like a horse when it decides it doesn’t like you, but stronger and breathing fire. The Summoner:  Nobody really know who and what Wizard is. There must be a face somewhere below his hood, right? Right? And did anyone ever heard him talk?Actually, yes. Wizard likes to talk and likes for people to listen to him. He will give a lot of advice, mostly unsolicited. Lots of topics too, from mechanics of best swordfight style to preferable way of peeling potatoes.People will roll their eyes when he’s mentioned but will listen when he talks to them, because they fear of being turned into frogs. He can do pretty powerful magic, that Wizard.His magic is a little out of this world - rays of light and green lighting The Witch:  Born with power to control the Fire, she grew up with not a lot of friends, because people were scared. She is very confident, even cocky, because of her (reasonable) belief she is able to defend herself. Likes to show her abilities. Kinda vain too, very obsessed with her looks. She eats only veggies and nobody really knows where does her strength really comes from.Deeper inside, she wants some people to acknowledge and like her - this is why she is very proud of her companions and will fight by their side till the very end.Quote: “Fire, walk with me” And many more unique and amazing characters, some of which will be designed by help from our respected Backers. The Power of MagicWe blended the power of troops with power of great and powerful magics that you can leverage to increase the power of your army and increase your chance of winning. Magic HallYou prepare the magics in magic hall, upgrade your magic hall to unlock new magics and to increase the speed and queue of the magics. Magic Spellswe tailored great and powerful magics for the game play to increase the fun and power of your army. TempleThis magical building is used to upgrade the power of your magics; make sure to build and upgrade it to unlock new magic upgrades and increase the power f our magics. Defense UnitsWe game you any kind of defense unit you may need to protect your kingdom from Cannon to Mortar to Air Defense, Ground and Air Bombs, Archer Tower, Freeze Tower, Lighting Tower, Walls and more to come in the updates.Upgrade your defense units to increase their Attack Power and HitPoints, make them stronger against enemy attacks to  protect your Kingdom.       TrapsWe added traps in the game, so you can trap the enemy troops and defend your village against their raid.  you have all kind of options, hidden bombs, freeze trap, fire trap, so feel free to learn them a lesson, freeze them, burn them, toast them, ??????? and wait for more new Traps to come.   The Kingdom is now in your capable hands and smart brain; implement a great strategy to protect your Kingdom, attack your enemies and move up to the ladder of leader board for our great prizes. Empire & Empire CastleNothing is more important than teaming up with great players and establish your great Empire; it all starts with your Empire Castle, build it and establish your Empire. You can support your alliance by sending them troops and magics to help them protect their kingdom and to increase the power and strengths of their army.  EmpireYou Can build an Empire to invite your friends and alliances to the Empire, together you can fight against other alliances and Empire for pride and victory.  Create your own Empire or join an existing Empire.Search the existing Empires based on many different factors and find the one that suits you to join. Or Create your own Empire from scratch and lead others to join your Empire and team up together for success:Design a stunning and stylish flag for your empire; so everyone can recognize your Empire.  Game EconomyGoldCollect Gold from unlimited underground resources by building and upgrading your gold mines; you can also collect golds in the battler by attacking opponent's gold mine and gold storage.

<p>As we mentioned, a full motion video (FMV) is a video game narration technique that relies upon <strong>pre-recorded videofiles</strong> (rather than sprites, vectors, or 3D models) to display action in the game (Wikipedia). But it was never real-time before, right?</p>

<p>Let’s go back to the 1980’s, when these good old-fashioned games were at their peak. That’s when I fell in love with this <i>not so popular </i>genre, even though my hunger for the games was never truly satisfied. FMVs have always missed something that can make them feel more like a <strong>hyper-realistic game </strong>than an interactive movie.</p>
<p>Then 5 years ago we decided to find the missing ingredients which can shoot the FMV genre to the stars. We tried our luck and published a simple but cool <strong>post-apocalyptic FMV game</strong>, that was the<strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shadesofviolet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SOV 1</a></strong> and<strong> <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shadesofviolet2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SOV 2</a></strong>, and it turned out that you loved it!

COMING SOON on:      


control real-life videos

experience the celebrity life 

explore locations, use objects, collect items and interact with your surroundings

conversate with NPCs, your choices having an impact on character development and karma

fight with multiple enemies controlling attack, defence and move combinations
do skill movements like parkour during a rooftop chase
aim and shoot during gunfights, car chases
control a small team on a mission
drive cars, quad and jet-ski, go rock-climbing or sky-diving through this thrilling story!



Action-packed game / real-time control 

Jack is a millionaire celebrity who treats people like sh*t. Stereotypic, but don't worry, you won't have to play him. Instead, you'll be replacing him! A wanted man, he must find a body double who looks like him, and as you probably already figured out, that’s you!

Story trailer
Your mission? Live like Jack. Act like him. Speak like him. Do the things which he does and try to survive in a world where friends are wolves in sheep's clothing, and enemies are even worse. Can you remain true to yourself or money changes everything?

FMVs have always missed something that can make them feel more like a hyper-realistic game than an interactive movie.

<li>Jungles should have umbrella-like canopies, with beams of sunlight filter through, moist, foggy ground covered with undergrowth. Sea of grass sway in the wind, stretching around you as far as the eyes can see. In the background, imposing mountain ranges resemble that of the Tibetan Plateau or the Gobi Desert. Or of another world in space, where remnants of meteorite impacts can still be seen. That's is what we envisioned and building.</li>

<p><br/> We have substantially invested in Oh Nebula. We Have been developing this game full-time for around a year, and covered all of the costs ourselves. As you can see in the video, this game is reaching a stage, where both visual &amp; gameplay are on track to be something special. But we need your support to be able to make Oh Nebula complete &amp; polished.</p>
<p>Money raised will enable us to cover expenses relating directly to development, hiring additional help, buying equipment &amp; tools. Should we raise funds above our target, it will allow us to develop some of the stretch goal features that we think will enhance the core game</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges are mainly coming from providing the basic incomes for each &amp; every team members. We have a core team of a few guys on salary, plus contract developers. Game engine &amp; frameworks are set. From now on all we need just taking contents from this rough stage, adding, polishing &amp; iterating the game to completion, as bug free as possible.</p>
<p>Kit has been through these kind of grinds for decades. Backers will be able to access the promised delivery time if funded.</p>

</div></div>","About our team & our game.

My name is Kit Hoang. I have been in the industry since the 2000s. Please refer to (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kithoang/). Since 2014, I founded a small team TYS Studio (http://www.tysstudio.com) & making indie games.

 

We carefully crafted a Sci-Fi outerspace world, that is filled with living things, creatures inhabited the barren wilderness, the mighty mountains and the misty jungles. In the deep dark caves, there lurk horrifying monsters. It has day/night and seasonal cycles.


It is an action-adventure game played from a third person shooter perspective. The world is fully open and the player can freely roam the environment. There are vehicles such as buggies, motorcycles and Jetpacks that you can collect, to assist your survival in this harsh world, find powerful weapons and equipment, earn new stats, hunt creatures & questing.
Jungles should have umbrella-like canopies, with beams of sunlight filter through, moist, foggy ground covered with undergrowth. Sea of grass sway in the wind, stretching around you as far as the eyes can see. In the background, imposing mountain ranges resemble that of the Tibetan Plateau or the Gobi Desert. Or of another world in space, where remnants of meteorite impacts can still be seen. That's is what we envisioned and building.

An exotic alien landscape as far as the eyes can see, you can scale the mountains, conquer the peaks and discover things beyond the distant valleys.
Vehicle types including Buggies, Motorbikes & Jetpacks. There are so far three types of weapon categories, powerful close range, long rage & small arms. we will be adding more types that  inspired by real guns with Sci-Fi capabilities. Both vehicles & weapons can be upgraded & modified.

Vehicles need fuels & other resources to maintain, which you can obtain in different ways. They have different characteristics, for example the ""Fuel Storage"" buggy in the video, it doesn't need to be refueled, but drives slow & will blow up when gets it.



This forsaken minor space human colony is driven by mining and other resources plundering. It is a lawless frontier where human migrants were subjected to brutal exploitation, while the local inhabitants & human military machine engaging in a seemingly eternal conflict.
There are back stories of the main characters. NPC from all segments of this society share their fragmented stories & experiences. Walking with them through joy & sorrow, pain & suffering. Piece together a picture of this planet's past & present, and your place in it.




50 pages Digital Artbook. Help fill in the back story of Oh Nebula. (IPad not included).


The game will be released on PC, Mac & Linux (via Steam) first.
If meets the Stretch Goals then XboxOne & PS4. We have all of the hardwares & done Microsoft XBoxOne port before.



 We have substantially invested in Oh Nebula. We Have been developing this game full-time for around a year, and covered all of the costs ourselves. As you can see in the video, this game is reaching a stage, where both visual & gameplay are on track to be something special. But we need your support to be able to make Oh Nebula complete & polished.
Money raised will enable us to cover expenses relating directly to development, hiring additional help, buying equipment & tools. Should we raise funds above our target, it will allow us to develop some of the stretch goal features that we think will enhance the core game


 
Risks & Challenges
The risks and challenges are mainly coming from providing the basic incomes for each & every team members. We have a core team of a few guys on salary, plus contract developers. Game engine & frameworks are set. From now on all we need just taking contents from this rough stage, adding, polishing & iterating the game to completion, as bug free as possible.
Kit has been through these kind of grinds for decades. Backers will be able to access the promised delivery time if funded.

<p>My best friend is a young, creative and extremely talented individual who started an indie game developing company in Kyiv. Even though the company began as one individual writing down his code ideas on a piece of paper during breaks between his classes, it has gained momentum and support. Now he has a team of hardworking individuals, who help him develop his new interesting  ideas and bring them up to life. I joined his team last year. <br/>Even though the company has grown, we still have a long way to go, as we lack a lot of resources. Since I joined the company, I know that my best friend has a big dream. He is always talking about building out an office that will have enough space for all of the coworkers to work cohesively together. Unfortunately, our company is pretty new and all the revenue goes toward funding new projects and covering our costs, which includes paying salaries to our programers and designers and our rent. <br/>I would love to make his dream come true, which is not possible without some sort of fundraising and help. I am not here to ask you to give me some money and promise that it will go towards a cause that will make you feel good about yourself. What I am here to propose is for you to get involved in a new movement. A movement that can gain momentum and reach a larger community of dreamers, who will be given the opportunity for their dreams to come true.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It was quite an interesting journey that I started on May 2020. It’s a lot to process &amp; share, so first I’ll provide here my formal writing to introduce myself: Let’s start with many bits about me.</p>
<p>To begin things, I’m currently just a restaurant supervisor of my family’s Pho restaurant chain in California’s Orange County &amp; a studious enthusiast of video games &amp; all unique creativity of current pop culture. Many months ago in 2020 I watched a YouTube video that showed off many arcade games of the 90s. One of them was Time Traveler. I’m a huge fan of the creative 1991 arcade classic &amp; I played it for the first time &amp; many times later at Circus Circus &amp; Mirage hotels in Las Vegas back in 1992. I loved Time Traveler for its innovative &amp; unique creativity...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the help of Indiegogo set for May 15th 2021, I plan to celebrate Time Traveler’s 30th Anniversary Celebration of its arcade release in November 11th 2021. The event will be fully non-profit &amp; I’m personally organizing it with a special YouTube-live fan-gathering event here at a retro arcade/bar in Santa Ana CA where the remaining original cast of actors, Mr. Rick Dyer, the remaining original developers tell stories about how Time Traveler came to be &amp; many other fun things with Q&amp;As, photo ops, &amp; autograph signings where most of the fans will cosplay as Time Traveler characters. What is most special is that each &amp; every attending fan will each be given a memorable t-shirt &amp; a collectible promo book which entails everything that pertains to Time Traveler, like newspaper stories &amp; magazine articles &amp; never before seen behind-the-scenes photos &amp; actors’ photos where autographs be signed. For the kindest of fans, they will be given admission to attend my event...</p>
<p>So far, I have already reached out to 17 of the original acting cast &amp; 14 of the original developers &amp; they’ve all given me their positive &amp; good-to-go response. They will all be fairly compensated for kindly giving their time for the love of Time Traveler &amp; all their fans. I will also make sure they &amp; all their family members are provided great lodging &amp; travel arrangements…</p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div><p>This is my very first time doing anything like this &amp; I’ll do my best to provide the best &amp; most comfortable experience for everyone. The real main focus of this event is not just a great reunion. This event is meant to restore the credibility, respects, recognitions, &amp; immortalization that slipped away from the performers &amp; developers of Time Traveler during 1991-1992 &amp; to have Time Traveler welcomed back into the great industry that is the video gaming community of this current generation. I did buy Digital Leisure’s DVD game of Time Traveler &amp; like the arcade version, it did not include End Credits.

You're not sure what they're protesting about, but you thought to yourself this might be fun, and it is always interesting to see a wall of police officers in anti-riot armor...  After a while of hanging in the back, you hear thump sounds and​ notice a few troublemakers at the front line have started throwing random objects at the police. Another group starts demolishing a nearby car. Just when you thought this might be a good time to leave, you hear shots get fired, and the crowd starts running away from the police, almost trampling you over. You look towards where a group of your friends is standing, when all of the sudden a stream of icy water from water cannon washes them away from your sight. You start looking for an escape route, but then a cloud of tear-gas smoke engulfs you and you begin to cough and stumble around half-blind...  You manage to leave the cloud, but then run straight into a police officer, who knocks you down with a baton and starts beating you on the ground. Next to you is another civilian, lying down unconscious with his hands cuffed behind his backs, his face covered in blood, is that the faith which awaits you as well? Suddenly, a molotov cocktail thrown out of nowhere hits the police officer's visor, setting him on fire, and he runs backwards, screaming while his colleges go after him with a fire extinguisher. You stand up and pick up a crowbar you found on the ground. Something begins to boil inside you, you are a citizen dammit, you know your rights and today you will fight for them. You think to yourself, this is either a dream, or the A.C.A.B. mod was finally released and you're playing it!</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485474376/jqaehic9kemeau7tznal.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Mount&amp;Blade engine is the best choice out there for any sort of conflict which involves melee, shields, thrown missiles and horseback fighting.  And modern day riots fit the description perfectly, yet the setting has not been explored enough, until now.</p><p>The more I played around with ideas and built prototypes, the more it became apparent that this mod setting has a huge potential in all of these areas: single player missions, multiplayer coop missions, multiplayer casual and role-play servers, regimental events.</p><p> </p><h3>How will it start?</h3><p>My current focus is towards two aspects: regimental events and role-play servers. Reasons are, it is easier to get decent number of players on an event server rather than casual one, and role-play/jailbreak servers are most popular and a natural choice considering the setting. In design concepts section at bottom of this page there are more explanations on how both of these types of servers would work. To answer the question directly, the first step will be to release public Alpha version and organize a test event, as is usual.</p><p>A single player mission type game is also an option but it will come later, as I want it to be done well. It shouldn't be a simple invasion type thing where you bash endless waves of bots. But primary development focus for now is building a mod for regimental event play where up to 200 players can join the riot event as either a group of rioters or a police force squad.</p><p>Events themselves would have a little bit of role-play elements, as obviously the victory condition in this setting cannot be to kill everyone in the enemy team, nor should police be able to immediately attack any ""enemy"" on the spot. If you're left wondering how can this work or will it even be fun, please do read the design concepts at bottom of this page, which will explain more.</p><p> </p><h3>Why the Riot Mod Needs Your Help?</h3><p>The mod, in it's current state, is already starting to achieve brilliance in gameplay, inventiveness, sound and atmosphere. But almost all the 3D models used for clothes and scene props are just place-holders, downloaded for free or made by me, to be replaced with quality models as I acquire them.</p><p>The problem is I am a coder, my modelling skills are limited, and all the good modelers I know will not produce quality models for free, especially for items as complex as clothing. And for a mob of civilians to look convincing, there needs to be a lot of different random clothing combinations. One section most lacking at the moment is head wear, as you can see on promo video, most civilians are still wearing centuries old Napoleonic Wars hats. Also, there are certain scene props which are  very much needed for the mod to be complete, but I wouldn't be able to make them myself, which is why acquiring models is a critical aspect, and to get quality results money needs to be payed to modelers, which is why I'm asking for your help.</p><p>I (and others who saw/tested it) firmly believe this is going to be an awesome mod, and it <strong>will</strong> be released whether this funding succeeds or fails. The difference is, it will work and look ten times more awesome if funding succeeds, and you will be able to pride yourself on the fact that you gave a contribution which made it all possible.</p><p><strong>Also, it is not just about 3D models, if funding succeeds and the modeling part of the job is off my back, I will be able to spend more time coding features and making it a better game, so your contribution will help all the game aspects improve, not just visual.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485474446/eofzitkzc45wa2630wjk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>I'm not going to pretend everything is skimmed milk and honey, of course there may be some risks and challenges on the road. Since I personally know the mod will be fun to play, the only risk is whether a sufficient mass of players will come to realize this, and the challenge is in helping them make their mind, but if you believe in this mod then you can help with that as well, with some good word of your mouth, or at least by spreading links to this or other related pages. Of course, there is a competition with other multiplayer event based mods, but that is another reason why I am asking for donations - better quality models, combined with fun gameplay, will give this mod an edge.</p><p>Another risk is whether some wild feature will make server with lots of players crash or lag outstandingly. I will use all my experience as a developer and knowledge of M&amp;B module system, combined with testing before publishing any release to prevent this from happening.</p><p>One more risk I can think of comes with the fact that this is a NW mod which means only owners of Napoleonic Wars can play it. However I don't see a problem with that, as a portion of people who quit NW out of boredom might come back to it just to play the riot mod.</p><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>I only need money to achieve the goal of having quality visuals, of course you can help in other ways. If you really like the mod idea that's a good start, you can help by talking about it and sharing links with your friends and enemies. If you are skilled modeler/texture artist/animator/sound engineer or are on your way to become one, you can help by doing some volunteer work. In return, apart from the pleasure of taking part in creation of this mod, you will get some work experience and things to add to your portfolio.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485474277/avlv2pbas8umjfq2fzia.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Q&amp;A:</h3><p><strong>Q: Why are you asking for such a small amount?</strong></p><p>My intention is not to become a hot-shot studio owner running on thousands of dollars of crowdfunded money, I just want to publish this awesome mod and make it look prettier and work better (and be published sooner) than it would without any funding. In my estimate, $500 is enough to achieve that. If we manage to gather more money, more improvements and a bigger content pool could be made, also game servers are not free, and the more money put into them the better. If we don't even reach the $500 goal, all backers will get their money back (campaign is set to <strong>fixed</strong> goal), and I will continue to work on the mod alone. This mod will be published eventually whether the funding works or not, though it will look worse and will take much more time until public release.

Of course you do higher damage the usual M&amp;B way - by holding the attack longer, aiming for the head, moving body with the swing, or just taking a bigger baton which does more damage.<br/>-Once in knocked down animation, if you hit a guy again while on the ground, one of three things will happen depending on damage amount:<br/>--Nothing, too low damage<br/>--Medium damage, the guy falls on his back for several seconds, and while in this position, as he is instinctively using his arms and legs to protect himself, all damage dealt to him is reduced times /4, as you are mostly hitting his arms and legs and not the head or torso. This allows fun times where several policemen are beating one person on the ground without much fear of killing him.<br/>--High damage, contused, with face down and won't wake up soon. Of course, hitting a guy further while in this state would mean you risk to kill him.</p><p><strong>Pistols and how they work:</strong></p><p>Depending on context it can scare them off, halt them, cuff them, all done by pressing X while holding a gun.<br/>Pistols should have next to no part in multiplayer riot event, but are useful for making solo play as a cop vs bots a richer experience.<br/>Sequence needs more polishing, for example they should drop wielded weapon properly before hands behind back animation.

Can be used to:<br/>1) identify individuals from enemy team, by aiming at someone and pressing a button you get to see his player name.<br/>2) order arrest, which means put a beacon over someone who should be taken out, as name of the target has to be picked from the list of names, it would be good to use 1) identify people first.<br/>3) report position, this would make beacon (visible by anyone in his team who has radio) flash over the radio user for few seconds so other unit commanders know his squad position.<br/>4) communication with other squads, radio could have shortcuts for useful communication between squad leaders on events, anyone who has radio in inventory would pick up these messages, shortcuts to say stuff like ""we're on position"", ""we're moving in"", ""requesting reinforcement"" etc....<br/>-Molotov cocktails, colored torches and other pyromaniac toys, I'd take special care to have decent fire dynamics. Molotovs are more a psychological tool to cause a hole in a line of cops, it wouldn't be easy to actually set a guy on fire but if it does happen, cop team should have someone who chose to carry fire extinguisher, hopefully they will remember to bring one of those.<br/>-Scene props which would allow server owner to use map editing to do some custom stuff which were previously possible only by modding (writing code), its hard to explain really, but the point would be to allow more control over server rules, and allow creation of custom role-play environments thought up by server owner without doing the actual modding, by just editing a map and adding invisible scene props which decide on server rules. I think prison break type server has most potential here, which is why there will be prison guard and inmate classes, and some suitable scene props.<br/>-Cuffing people, with police cuffs, obviously. If cuffing a target ordered by radio you get one point, and same like when capturing flag in siege nearby cops get a point.<br/>-Undercover detectives, cop class dressed up in random civilian clothes, hard to distinguish from rioters, if player has some sneaking skills he can get himself into the crowd. The fact that he doesn't have a banner wouldn't give him away as friendly banners would be turned off by default (as sides are civilians and cops, easy to distinguish without banners), what can give him away is when a rioter looks at him from upclose and the name label doesn't show up (""who the hell is this guy?"") but in a crowd that is hard to spot. Undercover is so far the only class which has choice to carry pistol with deadly ammo (currently glock17), other choices are tiny baton or pepper spray, and a mandatory badge (left hand shield item, so you can extend it towards the crowd as you hold the pistol in weapon hand, ofc the badge has only 1hp and will be beaten out of your hand if someone strikes at you).<br/>-Classes which are there for fun and roleplay, on cop team rp would be chief of police, CEO/businessman type, politician, news crew loyal to the regime, all are there only to have their asses kicked really. On rioter side RP classes would be demonstrators with transparents (though they can become formidable force), angry factory workers, homeless folk, adolescents who are there just to skip classes, independent TV crew, again, all there just to have their asses kicked. Actual fighting classes on riot side would be decided based on their weapon type or groups they belong to.<br/>-Destructable scene props, apart from spawning with some fun improvised weapons, rioters would have ways to get some more op weapons by destroying the environment, so some scene props like trash bin can be picked up and used as slow but OP missile/melee, if the crowd destroys a street sign it could be used as pole weapon, bench would give planks, some heavier weapons like street light poles would require a crowd to hit at a street light for some time until it breaks off, and police can prevent them from doing that. Weapon the size of a street light pole would be very slow but effective against line formations as it would break through shields.</p><p>-Several real-world locations and classes, though this largely depends on success of crowdfunding campaign.</p><p>-Uh, bunch of other stuff.<br/><br/><strong>How would an event work?</strong><br/>That is yet to be decided in practice but, the way I see it, typical default event would go like this - anti-riot team forms lines at desired position, preferably somewhere narrow, and watches what the rioters will do. Rioters can either walk up straight to police lines, or go destroy some props to get more dangerous weapons (in which case a squad may do an intervention against vandals), or just mess about. Obviously it would be for the best if least disciplined regiments get to be rioters.<br/><br/>In different scenarios rioters would fortify in a building or lay siege to police station. That search and destroy game type from native could be used for this mod, so rioters would have to destroy several objects on the scene and cops would have to prevent them, that would give some actual objectives, but a simple battle can work as well. In case of not enough interest for big events, a players vs bots mode could work, but I would rather not go with bots as in typical riot both teams should be inventive with their approach. For example one possible weapon for rioters is a folding ladder, which if uneqipped becomes a ladder scene prop, which can be used to get to high places or just stick out of the crowd, you won't see a bot doing that.<br/><br/>The police team is not allowed to use violence until they are given good reason, like if an individual tries to push through their line. So at the beginning rioters may decide to just throw taunts and insults and small harmless projectiles and pose next to cops, increasing the tension, but they shouldn't be attacked for that. Cops should use this time to look tough, hold the line and identify main suspects. Chief of police is using megaphone item to call the crowd to disperse, just for fun. In case larger objects are thrown at them, the police can start returning with tear gas. Squad leaders can start ordering arrests of spotted troublemakers. But to actually make that arrest, one whole squad will probably have to push forward, isolate the guy when they reach him and beat into submission+handcuff then drag him back behind lines. Once deadly weapons are used against the police or someone from police team gets knocked out, all violence is allowed.<br/><br/>Though even with full violence mode on, it would be tactically wrong for all cops to just start charging everyone as police team is supposed to have less players than riot team (10:7), so they would probably want to hold the lines and wear the crowd out with any means available (for example a few tear gas canisters well landed could completely prevent attack from one area), sending a squad to charge out only where a weakness is noticed, or one particularly dangerous rioter needs to be taken down, for example that guy supplying rioters with molotovs. If riot cavalry is available they would stand behind lines and at some point push beyond their line and make a turn like a horse figure in chess does, to isolate one group nearest to frontline enabling their capture or just breaking them, though foot units could do that move as well. Horses are very OP and almost as big as irl, though not as fast and manoeuvrable as in NW, and their rider is still fragile but safe from most short weapons. So horse is not a 1vs10 unit like in NW but a tactical addition, though in general you will want to stay away from a horse, which will be easy as they are slow and few.<br/><br/>For a round of battle to be won not everyone from the enemy team has to die, if everyone who are alive are either contused, surrendering or cuffed the round will end.<br/> </p><p><strong>Future plans: persistent servers.</strong></p><p>In case the mod gets a good amount of players, I will try to realize this idea of two interdependent server: <strong>Persistent Riot</strong> and <strong>Persistent Prison</strong>. In those servers there are no rounds, just two persistent worlds. You would get to play one same persistent character in both servers, though if you're playing as civilian character, you can join Persistent Prison only if you got arrested in Persistent Riot, and other way around, you can join Persistent Riot only if you get released or escape from Persistent Prison. The benefit of being an inmate in Persistent Prison is you can boost your stats by training while you're inside, and on the outside you can make money in criminal ways. It should be other way around for cops, they earn money while on prison guard duty, and on the outside they get +exp and stat boosts as they stalk the streets for crime-committing civilians. But of course there should be tons of other stuff you can do on those servers. And that is all I can say so far without spilling too many beans.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485474523/iivex2sabgznzk2f38wf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485474558/xhwa9hmjyw5nezwnctbe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485474609/xq8oxucqe0nstnltcoru.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485474643/rs8toqg2bhepfna746t2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485474668/rrlfgbgqym0uxuny8hyk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485474866/hvfybgyjfjcbbtnqrjnh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485475000/gp3pk2xeg8p3u9himvx0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485475960/ndovgkdxacqei05uhxhr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485476416/szlypraajohbjjbv5yfg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485476429/rj4b8kkrdowvrrfy381l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485476447/vbyqv9vxoezxwwxjidky.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485476463/hbehhmx1piwumjtqhc0j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485476608/xst2o4mxbhhotj9bovfk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485476479/iokbhc7uf9t4ik8fntrl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p></div>","You went downtown and tagged along with a crowd of protesters. You're not sure what they're protesting about, but you thought to yourself this might be fun, and it is always interesting to see a wall of police officers in anti-riot armor...  After a while of hanging in the back, you hear thump sounds and​ notice a few troublemakers at the front line have started throwing random objects at the police. Another group starts demolishing a nearby car. Just when you thought this might be a good time to leave, you hear shots get fired, and the crowd starts running away from the police, almost trampling you over. You look towards where a group of your friends is standing, when all of the sudden a stream of icy water from water cannon washes them away from your sight. You start looking for an escape route, but then a cloud of tear-gas smoke engulfs you and you begin to cough and stumble around half-blind...  You manage to leave the cloud, but then run straight into a police officer, who knocks you down with a baton and starts beating you on the ground. Next to you is another civilian, lying down unconscious with his hands cuffed behind his backs, his face covered in blood, is that the faith which awaits you as well? Suddenly, a molotov cocktail thrown out of nowhere hits the police officer's visor, setting him on fire, and he runs backwards, screaming while his colleges go after him with a fire extinguisher. You stand up and pick up a crowbar you found on the ground. Something begins to boil inside you, you are a citizen dammit, you know your rights and today you will fight for them. You think to yourself, this is either a dream, or the A.C.A.B. mod was finally released and you're playing it!SummaryMount&Blade engine is the best choice out there for any sort of conflict which involves melee, shields, thrown missiles and horseback fighting.  And modern day riots fit the description perfectly, yet the setting has not been explored enough, until now.The more I played around with ideas and built prototypes, the more it became apparent that this mod setting has a huge potential in all of these areas: single player missions, multiplayer coop missions, multiplayer casual and role-play servers, regimental events. How will it start?My current focus is towards two aspects: regimental events and role-play servers. Reasons are, it is easier to get decent number of players on an event server rather than casual one, and role-play/jailbreak servers are most popular and a natural choice considering the setting. In design concepts section at bottom of this page there are more explanations on how both of these types of servers would work. To answer the question directly, the first step will be to release public Alpha version and organize a test event, as is usual.A single player mission type game is also an option but it will come later, as I want it to be done well. It shouldn't be a simple invasion type thing where you bash endless waves of bots. But primary development focus for now is building a mod for regimental event play where up to 200 players can join the riot event as either a group of rioters or a police force squad.Events themselves would have a little bit of role-play elements, as obviously the victory condition in this setting cannot be to kill everyone in the enemy team, nor should police be able to immediately attack any ""enemy"" on the spot. If you're left wondering how can this work or will it even be fun, please do read the design concepts at bottom of this page, which will explain more. Why the Riot Mod Needs Your Help?The mod, in it's current state, is already starting to achieve brilliance in gameplay, inventiveness, sound and atmosphere. But almost all the 3D models used for clothes and scene props are just place-holders, downloaded for free or made by me, to be replaced with quality models as I acquire them.The problem is I am a coder, my modelling skills are limited, and all the good modelers I know will not produce quality models for free, especially for items as complex as clothing. And for a mob of civilians to look convincing, there needs to be a lot of different random clothing combinations. One section most lacking at the moment is head wear, as you can see on promo video, most civilians are still wearing centuries old Napoleonic Wars hats. Also, there are certain scene props which are  very much needed for the mod to be complete, but I wouldn't be able to make them myself, which is why acquiring models is a critical aspect, and to get quality results money needs to be payed to modelers, which is why I'm asking for your help.I (and others who saw/tested it) firmly believe this is going to be an awesome mod, and it will be released whether this funding succeeds or fails. The difference is, it will work and look ten times more awesome if funding succeeds, and you will be able to pride yourself on the fact that you gave a contribution which made it all possible.Also, it is not just about 3D models, if funding succeeds and the modeling part of the job is off my back, I will be able to spend more time coding features and making it a better game, so your contribution will help all the game aspects improve, not just visual.Risks & ChallengesI'm not going to pretend everything is skimmed milk and honey, of course there may be some risks and challenges on the road. Since I personally know the mod will be fun to play, the only risk is whether a sufficient mass of players will come to realize this, and the challenge is in helping them make their mind, but if you believe in this mod then you can help with that as well, with some good word of your mouth, or at least by spreading links to this or other related pages. Of course, there is a competition with other multiplayer event based mods, but that is another reason why I am asking for donations - better quality models, combined with fun gameplay, will give this mod an edge.Another risk is whether some wild feature will make server with lots of players crash or lag outstandingly. I will use all my experience as a developer and knowledge of M&B module system, combined with testing before publishing any release to prevent this from happening.One more risk I can think of comes with the fact that this is a NW mod which means only owners of Napoleonic Wars can play it. However I don't see a problem with that, as a portion of people who quit NW out of boredom might come back to it just to play the riot mod. Other Ways You Can HelpI only need money to achieve the goal of having quality visuals, of course you can help in other ways. If you really like the mod idea that's a good start, you can help by talking about it and sharing links with your friends and enemies. If you are skilled modeler/texture artist/animator/sound engineer or are on your way to become one, you can help by doing some volunteer work. In return, apart from the pleasure of taking part in creation of this mod, you will get some work experience and things to add to your portfolio.Q&A:Q: Why are you asking for such a small amount?My intention is not to become a hot-shot studio owner running on thousands of dollars of crowdfunded money, I just want to publish this awesome mod and make it look prettier and work better (and be published sooner) than it would without any funding. In my estimate, $500 is enough to achieve that. If we manage to gather more money, more improvements and a bigger content pool could be made, also game servers are not free, and the more money put into them the better. If we don't even reach the $500 goal, all backers will get their money back (campaign is set to fixed goal), and I will continue to work on the mod alone. This mod will be published eventually whether the funding works or not, though it will look worse and will take much more time until public release. In case of a low support (less than 50% of goal reached) I'll change focus from multiplayer to single player missions.Q: Why are you making a new M&B mod now when Bannerlord is about to be released?No one really knows when the Bannerlord will come out, but when it does, it certainly won't have anything like the riot mod. Also, this can be a sort of mod which extends the game's life, as some players who quit or would quit NW out of boredom might come back to it just to play the riot mod. Another point to make is, all the assets we acquire thanks to your donations can be used in remaking the mod for Bannerlord, when and if the time comes. But I will not be making any Bannerlord mods at it's very first release, as there will probably be a lot of game updates/patches before modding it becomes worthwhile. Q: Can you port A.C.A.B. to be Native mod instead of Napoleonic Wars mod?In short, no. Using NW as basis has saved me a lot of development time. Though it might get ported into Bannerlord eventually. If and when that happens, all the backers will keep their perks in a new version, which makes sense as the port would be using a lot of assets which were payed with backers' money.Q: Will anyone be able to host their own A.C.A.B. server?Yes, server files will be released as well, though only official servers will have benefits of persistent database storage. Server owners will have tools in form of special scene props and extended admin menu which will allow them to create a unique type of server without actual modding.Q: What about the system requirements for playing A.C.A.B. mod?The mod will have more complex textures and models with higher polygon count than your usual Mount&Blade mod, so the requirements will probably be somewhere at North&South or Blood&Iron level but not above that. Fixing frame rate problems which may arise will be my constant focus.Q: I noticed there are some perks which make unique skins/items available, how does that work? ""Unique"" means only you can spawn with those items. A portion of money you payed for the perk will go towards creation of that item, the rest goes towards mod budget. Developers keep the right to refuse an item creation if it is inappropriate, so it is best to contact me and check if your desired item kind is allowed before paying for the perk.  Some Plans & Design Concepts Here comes a lot of text, mainly bits and pieces from the design document, read it if you're very interested in how the game will work.If you want to know, baton dynamics currently work like this:-if you hit a guy with a baton, with higher damage you have much higher chance to knock him on the ground (typical knocked by blunt damage 3 seconds animation), unless the guy is holding unarmed block (unarmed block animation changed so the guy is bent down slightly and using arms to protect his whole head). Of course you do higher damage the usual M&B way - by holding the attack longer, aiming for the head, moving body with the swing, or just taking a bigger baton which does more damage.-Once in knocked down animation, if you hit a guy again while on the ground, one of three things will happen depending on damage amount:--Nothing, too low damage--Medium damage, the guy falls on his back for several seconds, and while in this position, as he is instinctively using his arms and legs to protect himself, all damage dealt to him is reduced times /4, as you are mostly hitting his arms and legs and not the head or torso. This allows fun times where several policemen are beating one person on the ground without much fear of killing him.--High damage, contused, with face down and won't wake up soon. Of course, hitting a guy further while in this state would mean you risk to kill him.Pistols and how they work:Depending on context it can scare them off, halt them, cuff them, all done by pressing X while holding a gun.Pistols should have next to no part in multiplayer riot event, but are useful for making solo play as a cop vs bots a richer experience.Sequence needs more polishing, for example they should drop wielded weapon properly before hands behind back animation. Also a cop should be locked in cuffing animation until a suspect is cuffed.Molotovs and how they work:Possibility to get ignited if close enough to source of open flame. Burn levels are accumulated per individual, lower burn level means person is just a little bit on fire and burn level will be decreasing in time which means fire will be put out by itself. Higher burn levels keep rising in time as person is more and more engulfed in flames, in which case only a fire extinguisher can reduce a burn level.Note that regular sized molotovs cocktails are not meant to be OP area of damage weapon or anything like that, they are used for disturbing the lines, as dropping it bellow cop's feet will make them do the hop animation, and only in rare cases will they actually set people on fire, those will mostly be freak accidents.Some of amusing features planned:-Water cannon -usually only one per cop team, like NW cannon, but a continuous stream used to push people away or at least stun them.-Radio - walkie-talkie however you want to call it, is what leaders of squads (officers) get. Can be used to:1) identify individuals from enemy team, by aiming at someone and pressing a button you get to see his player name.2) order arrest, which means put a beacon over someone who should be taken out, as name of the target has to be picked from the list of names, it would be good to use 1) identify people first.3) report position, this would make beacon (visible by anyone in his team who has radio) flash over the radio user for few seconds so other unit commanders know his squad position.4) communication with other squads, radio could have shortcuts for useful communication between squad leaders on events, anyone who has radio in inventory would pick up these messages, shortcuts to say stuff like ""we're on position"", ""we're moving in"", ""requesting reinforcement"" etc....-Molotov cocktails, colored torches and other pyromaniac toys, I'd take special care to have decent fire dynamics. Molotovs are more a psychological tool to cause a hole in a line of cops, it wouldn't be easy to actually set a guy on fire but if it does happen, cop team should have someone who chose to carry fire extinguisher, hopefully they will remember to bring one of those.-Scene props which would allow server owner to use map editing to do some custom stuff which were previously possible only by modding (writing code), its hard to explain really, but the point would be to allow more control over server rules, and allow creation of custom role-play environments thought up by server owner without doing the actual modding, by just editing a map and adding invisible scene props which decide on server rules.

On rioter side RP classes would be demonstrators with transparents (though they can become formidable force), angry factory workers, homeless folk, adolescents who are there just to skip classes, independent TV crew, again, all there just to have their asses kicked. Actual fighting classes on riot side would be decided based on their weapon type or groups they belong to.-Destructable scene props, apart from spawning with some fun improvised weapons, rioters would have ways to get some more op weapons by destroying the environment, so some scene props like trash bin can be picked up and used as slow but OP missile/melee, if the crowd destroys a street sign it could be used as pole weapon, bench would give planks, some heavier weapons like street light poles would require a crowd to hit at a street light for some time until it breaks off, and police can prevent them from doing that. Weapon the size of a street light pole would be very slow but effective against line formations as it would break through shields.-Several real-world locations and classes, though this largely depends on success of crowdfunding campaign.-Uh, bunch of other stuff.How would an event work?That is yet to be decided in practice but, the way I see it, typical default event would go like this - anti-riot team forms lines at desired position, preferably somewhere narrow, and watches what the rioters will do. Rioters can either walk up straight to police lines, or go destroy some props to get more dangerous weapons (in which case a squad may do an intervention against vandals), or just mess about. Obviously it would be for the best if least disciplined regiments get to be rioters.In different scenarios rioters would fortify in a building or lay siege to police station. That search and destroy game type from native could be used for this mod, so rioters would have to destroy several objects on the scene and cops would have to prevent them, that would give some actual objectives, but a simple battle can work as well. In case of not enough interest for big events, a players vs bots mode could work, but I would rather not go with bots as in typical riot both teams should be inventive with their approach. For example one possible weapon for rioters is a folding ladder, which if uneqipped becomes a ladder scene prop, which can be used to get to high places or just stick out of the crowd, you won't see a bot doing that.The police team is not allowed to use violence until they are given good reason, like if an individual tries to push through their line. So at the beginning rioters may decide to just throw taunts and insults and small harmless projectiles and pose next to cops, increasing the tension, but they shouldn't be attacked for that. Cops should use this time to look tough, hold the line and identify main suspects. Chief of police is using megaphone item to call the crowd to disperse, just for fun. In case larger objects are thrown at them, the police can start returning with tear gas. Squad leaders can start ordering arrests of spotted troublemakers. But to actually make that arrest, one whole squad will probably have to push forward, isolate the guy when they reach him and beat into submission+handcuff then drag him back behind lines. Once deadly weapons are used against the police or someone from police team gets knocked out, all violence is allowed.Though even with full violence mode on, it would be tactically wrong for all cops to just start charging everyone as police team is supposed to have less players than riot team (10:7), so they would probably want to hold the lines and wear the crowd out with any means available (for example a few tear gas canisters well landed could completely prevent attack from one area), sending a squad to charge out only where a weakness is noticed, or one particularly dangerous rioter needs to be taken down, for example that guy supplying rioters with molotovs. If riot cavalry is available they would stand behind lines and at some point push beyond their line and make a turn like a horse figure in chess does, to isolate one group nearest to frontline enabling their capture or just breaking them, though foot units could do that move as well. Horses are very OP and almost as big as irl, though not as fast and manoeuvrable as in NW, and their rider is still fragile but safe from most short weapons. So horse is not a 1vs10 unit like in NW but a tactical addition, though in general you will want to stay away from a horse, which will be easy as they are slow and few.For a round of battle to be won not everyone from the enemy team has to die, if everyone who are alive are either contused, surrendering or cuffed the round will end. Future plans: persistent servers.In case the mod gets a good amount of players, I will try to realize this idea of two interdependent server: Persistent Riot and Persistent Prison. In those servers there are no rounds, just two persistent worlds. You would get to play one same persistent character in both servers, though if you're playing as civilian character, you can join Persistent Prison only if you got arrested in Persistent Riot, and other way around, you can join Persistent Riot only if you get released or escape from Persistent Prison. The benefit of being an inmate in Persistent Prison is you can boost your stats by training while you're inside, and on the outside you can make money in criminal ways. It should be other way around for cops, they earn money while on prison guard duty, and on the outside they get +exp and stat boosts as they stalk the streets for crime-committing civilians. But of course there should be tons of other stuff you can do on those servers. And that is all I can say so far without spilling too many beans.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Keatz has been abandoned by the society because of his inability to fly like other birds can. Not only that, the Government of the bird country ""Heavens"" decided to eliminate all the flightless birds residing there. Keatz, himself, decided to start a journey against the corruptions and social evils and also against the dumb decisions made by the Heavens Government. He wanted to make a room for himself when everything was falling apart. One day, he came across another flightless bird who soon became his friend and a part of his life. His life changed for a few days until they were attacked again by Heavens's soldiers and the peace did not last long, unfortunately.  </p>
<p><i>""Will Keatz be able to protect all the flightless bird? Will he be able to protect his best friend who became the part of his life and with whom he promised of never leaving her side?""</i></p>
<p>It is a mystery which still remained unsolved....</p>

   Backyard BrawlJust west of the farm, you may have seen a strange wrestling ring sized area cleared in the long grass. The blood on the floor is a bit of a clue that on an evening once a week not all is at it seems! In this free expansion, you will get to see how tough you really are when all the rules are thrown out of the window!The theme of this expansion will be legitimate tough guys and the Brawl for All tournament. Think Brock Lesnar types to get an idea of what you may come up against here!Add on perks include;Design an Illegal Move - Tell us the move's name, how it is performed, and what body part it should damage. When the move is performed the commentators will describe your move as it's performed!Design an Illegal Weapon - Outside of the ring anything goes, including weapons! Tell us what the weapon is, what it's sprite should look like, and what body part it will damage! Weapons will have their own custom 24px x 24px image in the player's inventory. Spirited SquadAnyone who has been playing Brass Town and visited the church will notice a restless spirit has been wandering the church. With this free expansion players will get to wrestle against restless spirits to uncover the truth about the history between The Rev and Spivey! The theme of this expansion will be skeletons in the closet, and bad wrestling gimmicks. Think ""The Shock Master"" and you will be pretty close to the types of spirits you will be wrestling!Add on perks include;Design an Awful Gimmick! Tell us all about the awful gimmick that the player will be able to use. We intend to add a whole new branch of ""Awful"" gimmicks that the player can develop using ideas they earn in the library. Gimmicks in Brass Town Wrestling take up the slot usually reserved for weapons in traditional JRPGs and give the player various bonuses. Size MattersThe bigger they are the harder they fall! Bringing the weight system into focus, this expansion shines the spotlight on the importance of weight classes. Wanna be the best cruiserweight in town, or a not so gentle giant? This planned expansion aims to make size matter as you unlock special events depending on your weight class.This expansion is intended to integrate into the special event matches when you don't have a title match or personal feud. There will be weight class specific tournaments and special stipulation fights for the player to battle through to etch their name in Brass Town history.Add on perks include;Design a Trophy - This add on allows you to name and design the trophy the player wins as the ultimate super-heavyweight/cruiserweight. Above are examples of the type of trophy you can design. Fashion CopsThis planned expansion focuses on a major graphical update. The goal is to have your ring attire match what you see when you walk to and get into the ring. We also plan to add more customised entrance music, pyro and entrance graphics.This is a fairly big expansion in terms of graphics and programming, and possibly less exciting at first glance than the other expansions.

Contrary to what many people think, developing a video game is not a matter of a few months, but years. During this phase the financial resources of the project, apart from the acquisition of computer equipment and necessary licenses, is mainly the labor cost arising from the salaries of the great professionals involved in this creative process ( computer engineers, graphic designers, backend and frontend programmers, musicians, and a long etc. of other professionals who are also involved in the development of the project).</p><p>As you can imagine, during this whole process of important investments no incomes are generated and therefore, on many occasions without a good management of resources many gaming projects perish during the programming phase. The unforeseen events that arise from the development are countless, and knowing how to manage them properly is often the key to the success or failure of the game.</p><p>When we decided to start this adventure we managed to raise between personal contributions, about 150K, and we had to carefully select the game areas in which we used such resources. We decided that much of the investment should be spent on areas that could be leveraged in the future game updates, so the initial investment would be as productive as possible. Thus, we decided that the vast majority of the budget should go to the development of the algorithm that gave life to AI, to the detriment of others such as design, UI, tutorials, graphic effects, etc. that we could not cover. We knew that allocating that budget to a back-end section of the game, which the user would not appreciate with the naked eye, it was quite risky, but as in everything in this life you had to make a decision, and we created a solid simulator. Only time will tell if we were right.</p><p>After 13 months of hard work, we gave birth to our first digital baby. Finally on November 29, 2019 we published in the App Store <strong>MANAGE&amp;WIN FOOTBALL LITE</strong>, the first game of the M&amp;W universe to show our vision upon competitive football games without randomization, mixed with RPG.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582732439/uyjebtfi7ircrc5zbz1v.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/>The acceptance, as we told you was better than expected, getting to put <strong>the game 64th most downloaded from the AppStore</strong> (yuhu!), but we actually knew of the shortcomings of this game version, and the reality soon knocked our door.</p><p>If we go into the graphics, we find areas of great improvement and innovation. From rendering matches in 3D, more cool visual effects when you launch a Power Up, customization options according to a premium game -clothing, shields, stadiums, etc.-.</p><p>We want to evolve towards  a Total Football Manager concept, where not only the sports tactics are developed, but also the possibility to manage the economy, budget, the 'rookies school'  and social area of the club in a more professional way, to be able to become not only a star of the sport but in a football tycoon.</p><p>We want to introduce a much more global and active player market, where a team of scouts will offer you young pearls to be trained until they become a new Messi or CR7.

In short, we want to improve the quality of the graphics and make playing much easier and more fun. What we'll do for it:</p><ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li>
<strong>Redesign the art and design</strong> of many of the game's screens, creating a much cleaner, simpler and more intuitive UI.</li>
<li>
<strong>Represent 3D embossed players</strong> during the match in the form of soda bottle plates. Cool eh!</li>
<li>
<strong>Add customization elements for teams</strong>, new shields, t-shirts and items that are displayed during matches and allow you to create a skin of differentiation from other teams.</li>
<li>
<strong>Create a series of equipment with special powers</strong> that you can take to each match and improve certain parameters of your team (resistance, speed, strength...). These kits will be ranked in different levels and will be unlocked as the team moves up from the league.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improve visual effects </strong>when PowerUps are released during matches.</li>
<li>Create a simpler and more didactic <strong>interactive tutorial</strong>. Where every coach starts at a school for coaches and receives a hands-on session of all the sections he must know of the game, before going to the open sea to compete against other players.</li>

<strong>PHASE 2. 3D REPRESENTATION OF MATCHES AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE GAME AI.</strong> <strong> +60,000 EUR.</strong>
</h3><p>This second phase continues to deepen into the user experience, its engagement and gameplay. On the one hand, we want the matches to have a real 3D representation to improve the player's immersion in the match, and to be able to better see the tactics of your opponent, and on the other hand develop the algorithm of the game so that it has all the essential elements of a match football.

<strong>Improve the AI of the game</strong> by continuing with the development of the algorithm that gives it life. In this phase, all the sections of a football match that have not been able to be implemented, such as fouls, offsides, corners, kicks, penalties, etc. will be added to the game.</li>
<li>
<strong>A real-time monitor</strong> will be developed to represent the average attack and defence of your team and your rival. This will give the manager information during the match of how they evolve and affect the attack and defines of the decisions that are made, as well as the release of Power Ups.</li>

<strong>PHASE 3.</strong> <strong>EVOLUTION TO A TOTAL FOOTBALL MANAGER. </strong> <strong>+250,000 EUR.</strong>
</h3><p>In this third phase, we want to evolve the functionalities of the game towards a Total Football Manager. Improving not only the management options of the sports plot, but also introducing new management areas, such as the economic, managerial, social and marketing areas of a club. Because we know that winning matches is cool but putting on Abramovich's shoes one day is cool so much more!</p><ul style=""list-style-type:circle;""><li>
<u><strong>Programming the game on servers: </strong></u>To be able to bring life the management of all these areas and that interconnect among all users it is necessary that the information is accessible to all users. This only happens if the game is programmed and runs directly from the cloud, not on each of the mobile devices as it does now. Thus, we will schedule a new version of the game that meets the necessary requirements so that all users can be connected in a global community of Managers, perform transfers of players, stadiums, shields, etc.</li></ul><ul style=""list-style-type:circle;""><li>
<u><strong>Improved management of Sport Area:</strong></u><ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li>
<strong>Scout team and affiliate team:</strong> The club will be equipped with a scouting team who will be in charge of finding young promises to incorporate them into the club and evolve them into stars worldwide. The possibility of managing a subsidiary team to grow these young promises will be introduced. Yes, because the next Messi is out there waiting for you to find him.</li>
<li>
<strong>Transfer Market: </strong>Create a virtual market for player transfers and other game items. You can sell and buy everything from skins, Power Ups, coaches, doctors, to stadiums. Earn revenue from the sale of any assets in your club, and buy in the market all the necessary elements to make the team of your dreams a reality.</li>
<li>
<strong>Technical Team:</strong> The sports strategy of the game will be developed to make it similar to that of any great football team today. Physical preparers, psychologists, doctors, defensive, offensive, tactical coach, etc. Only by hiring the best professionals it's possible to optimize the evolution of your players by creating a highly competitive team in all sports areas.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sports facilities:</strong> Sports facilities (gym, training camps, nursing, etc.) can be created and improved to make the evolution and progression of players faster and more effective.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul><ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li>
<u><strong>Incorporation of the Economic strategy</strong></u><ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li>
<strong>Economic Management of the team:</strong> Only optimal and effective management of your team will allow you to increase your annual budget to sign the best players in the world. Management of wage costs, termination clauses, ticket sales, advertising on T-shirts and in the stadium, sales of drinks and food, opening of new own stores, sponsorship contracts with sports brands, ... Football is sport and passion, but also a business. Optimize these plots and become the Tycoon of world football... let's Abramovich be a simple fan by your side.</li>
<li>
<strong>Football Stadium:</strong> Turn your team's stadium into a world-class benchmark. Improve your club's revenue, sponsorship contracts and access to better competitions. It all starts in a schoolyard, struggles to see built the stadium of your dreams.</li>
<li>
<strong>Official Stores:</strong> Create a network of official club stores that generate sufficient resources to keep the team and grow economically and socially.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing and Sponsorship Contracts:</strong> The more your team grows, the better the contracts you will have access to, from sports brands to stadium names. Be creative to optimize this important economic plot and be able to balance the club's accounts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Food and Refreshment Sales:</strong> Do not underestimate this method of obtaining recurring resources. Manage sales prices and procurement. The better your equipment is ranked, the better sales prices you can offer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<u><strong>Incorporation of the Social&amp;Media Area</strong></u><ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li>
<strong>Supporters:</strong> Manage relationships with fans, only keeping them happy will your relevance in media will be important. Hold events with the fans, promotional activities, etc. so that your social mass supports your team inside and outside the stadium.</li>

<strong>PHASE 4.</strong> <strong>VISION COME TRUE. </strong> <strong>+350,000 EUR.</strong>
</h3><p>Just thinking that this could be done makes us cry out. Being able to bring our vision to your devices thanks to your support is something we could never forget.</p><p>The first thing to say is that this phase would be almost entirely dedicated to a backend phase, where substantial changes would arise from the implementation of a new game system that would allow players to monetize their skill and dedication to the game through a paid system of eSport Amateur championships, and the creation of a Real Market in a Virtual World, where you could sell in exchange for real money the digital assets that each of you has created (i.e. players, PowerUps, limited edition kits, etc.).</p><p>Implementing this new game system generates significant investments to bring legitimacy and security to all transactions performed. While similar systems exist in other fields, such as online casinos, their adaptation to the world of video games is not standardized and is therefore difficult and expensive.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582813608/lkm0s00u3ebicgy1mt4v.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The programming investment of this phase would be aimed at the creation of the following areas:</p><ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li>
<strong>Creation of a paid system of championships and leagues:</strong> A system of tournaments and leagues must be implemented that allow the user to register in exchange for paying an entrance ticket. Depending on the player's evolution in the tournament, the profits earned will accrue in their individual account, which they can withdraw to their current account when they consider. A database with sufficient security and integrity must be programmed and maintained to ensure the legitimacy of all funds that are incorporated into the user's account as a result of their participation in paid tournaments.</li>
<li>
<strong>Creating a Real Market in the Virtual World:</strong> How many hours we've spent playing our favourite video games to have better characters, better skins, unlock players, etc. And so far, they only served for the enjoyment of the user himself. Until now. At M&amp;W we will create a real market in the virtual world, making all the digital assets that are created belong to the users themselves. Thus through a system of transfers and withdrawal clauses you can put in value your players, stadiums, coaches, PoweUps, Skins, etc. And if you are able to create the next CR7 or Messi the market should recognize it. Okay, maybe you'll get up one morning and Messi's disappeared from your club... ?  but in return you will have obtained a few dollars that you can deposit into your bank account whenever you want to ?. We all know that our time is worth money, but from now on you can charge for it. What do you think, you sign up?</li>
<li>
<strong>Creating a two-way payment gateway: </strong>As the last step of the roadmap, a two-way payment gateway must be incorporated within the game, so that you can receive in your current account the revenue generated by your tournament triumphs or sale of digital assets. In the world of video games, you can count on the fingers of the hand adventurers who have incorporated a similar reward system. We must program and incorporate our own payment gateway that is totally reliable and secure for our users.</li>

If you like video games, we're sure you’ll be interested in this story.   OUR VISIONEARN REAL MONEY JUST PLAYING A VIDEOGAMENo jokes. It's our vision, to democratize the Amateur eSports Games. Once our vision comes true, players will be able to compete against other Managers and get rewarded for their victories with real money, and sell digital assets created within the game to other players for real money.It's simple as that. Who has not spent hours and hours playing to their favorite game for simple fun. Devoting effort and money to improve or unlocking characters, items, etc. What all that effort could be now monetized?The world of video games is a constantly developing world, leading the use of new technologies. Nevertheless, we believe that most of the advances have been focused mainly on the game itself, its format, its use or its distribution.This constant evolution in the gaming world, on the contrary, has not yet led to an ecosystem allowing players to generate profits within the game. The industry follows a total traditional scheme in terms of how to generate revenue, enabling only one-way channel that only allows game developers to profit from gamers. Our ProposalWhat if we could change the rules in the gaming industry?The world of eSports has brought for the first time, the possibility for the players to become the real protagonists by generating real incomes from their participation in tournaments and other sporting events.Our mission - IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PLAYER - is to extend that model to the world of amateur video games. To democratize the paid competitions of eSports, with the sole purpose of allowing the entire gamer community, and not only the professional ones, to monetize their skill and talent by playing video games. Are you signing up?  WHO ARE WE?In fall 2018, MANAGE & WIN was founded by three video game lovers who wanted to create a new model that surpassed the traditional concept of gaming.To do this, we contributed our modest savings, alongside some contributions from family and friends (yes the wonderful FFF, thank you from heart), and founded the company MANAGE & WIN, to share our vision with the gaming community around the world. In order to achieve this, we teamed up with AKAONI STUDIO, a Spanish video game developer, known for number one sales game in Japan, ‘Zombie Panic in Wonderland'. With everyone's joint effort, MANAGE & WIN finally released in autumn 2019 its first beta of the game 'MANAGE & WIN FOOTBALL' for the IOS universe, which has become the first stone in the gamer universe of MANAGE & WIN! You can download the first beta of the game at the link below!https://apps.apple.com/es/app/manage-win-football-lite/id1473794427 The release received more than remarkable, certainly much better than any of us could expect, becoming the 64th most downloaded game of the AppStore within hours of its release.This new vision that we want to share with the gamer community has attracted the curiosity of the media, even becoming the subject of a report on the program 'NewsWatch', issued on the  AMC Network last 28 February 2020.Yes, it's the video you watched on the top of the page! BUT WHAT IS M&W FOOTBALL?M&W Football is a football simulator game that puts the spotlight on the match day. The player will experience what it is to become the coach of a professional football team, controlling every technical aspect of a match. Players can design their starting eleven, and through our intuitive and quite cool system they will be able to change a multitude of parameters during the match. The algorithm that brings the game's AI to life has been developed based on a 0% randomness - yes 0.00% promised - for the players to control each tactic, positioning, style of play, etc. in order to obtain victories. For the first time, we allow decisions to be transferred in real time to the match, with a real effect on the match. Players will have to learn reading the opponent's tactics and modify their style to beat them. Winning or losing will only depend on the skill. In this regard, this algorithm adapts in real time the game AI to each and every modification made during the match.To that purpose, each coach will use three tactical screens to configure the team, before and during the match. Formation Screen   Through this screen the coach will be able to change the formation of the team (go from a typical 4-4-2 to an aggressive 4-3-3 just a simple tap) and perform replacements within the match.In these screens you can also check the physical and mood status of your squad, as well as their affinity to the position in which you want them to play. Offensive Tactics ScreenThrough this screen you will manage, modify and adapt at each moment of the match all the offensive parameters of your team. It's your team, do it your style and leave your DNA on the field. Cholo, Zizu, Klopp, Guardiola, ... you choose, you decide. Defensive Tactics ScreenUsing this screen you will configure all the defensive parameters. You can modify were to put the defensive line, the takeout of the goalkeeper, the defensive markings, as well as the aggressiveness in the pressure and recovery of the ball. You want 'Catenaccio' Rocks! ... all yours. And what if we mix football games with the world of RPGs... Come and try!Indeed, we like football managers, but also role-playing games, especially the part of the cards (Power Ups) that you can unlock, collect, and throw in the middle of a game to crush your opponent! Well, have designed and included in MW Football more than 40 cards -the number will increase in the future- that give your team a series of 'super powers' for a limited time during the match (physical, tactical, defense skill improvements).   In each match you can carry a deck of 5 cards pre-selected from the total unlocked and use against each opponent a maximum of 3 cards during the match. Their duration and effectiveness will depend on the category of the card (bronze, silver, gold or special category), as well as the type of training and tactics you are employing. For example, the Ram' card is very effective against closed defences, but much more so if you put on the field 'tank-type' strikers, and you raise the intensity level of your players.  Game systemToday the M&W Football format is set up as a free, multiplayer game where you can compete against other Managers around the world and fight to become the best and most famous eSports Football Manager.Each player will configure all of their team's sporting parameters, from the starting Eleven, to any offensive or defensive tactics. You will select the Power Ups that best suit you for each match, and register for tournaments where you will compete online against other 'World Managers'.With each victory you will receive experience points, that will make your team reach new leagues. On the other hand, defeats will subtract points. Every Manager will start his journey in the crowded 'College Yard League' and fight to get to the mythical 'League of Legends' where only the chosen ones enter.With each upgrade, new players and Power Up cards will be unlocked, that will give you new and original chances to smash your opponent. 
Player Pool  The first version of M&W Football has been configured with a common player pool system for all Managers. Initially there will be a common 20-player pool from which each team's squad will be selected. This number of initial players amounts to 48, that will be unlocked with each team upgrade. Each player has unique characteristics and abilities. There are more versatile ones that allow them to be aligned in different positions without losing any performance, others that are real starts in a certain role, but totally incompatible with a change of position. Someone are Skilled, others more resolute, fast, tactical players, smarties, toughies, explosives, strategists, chaotic ... all of them have their lights and their shadows. Choose the ones that best suit your style of play and lead your team to glory. GOOD, WHAT NOW?We are realistic, and we know that what we have achieved so far is only the first step of a long, long journey. The game we've released is a very preliminary view of the entire M&W universe we want to create. In order to take the next steps we now just need your support! Developing a video game is a project that is especially difficult to undertake without a proper financial structure. Contrary to what many people think, developing a video game is not a matter of a few months, but years.

From rendering matches in 3D, more cool visual effects when you launch a Power Up, customization options according to a premium game -clothing, shields, stadiums, etc.-.We want to evolve towards  a Total Football Manager concept, where not only the sports tactics are developed, but also the possibility to manage the economy, budget, the 'rookies school'  and social area of the club in a more professional way, to be able to become not only a star of the sport but in a football tycoon.We want to introduce a much more global and active player market, where a team of scouts will offer you young pearls to be trained until they become a new Messi or CR7. By means of specific trainings you will evolve your players and/or recover them physically and psychologically with a top-level medical team.Anyway, we've shown that with a modest budget we've been able to survive the odyssey of a video game's conception, development and release - and we've loved the experience - but we're nonconformist and ambitious alike, we want to continue growing and improving. Now that you know this project, it's your time to decide if you give us the opportunity to turn our vision into reality. WHERE WE'LL INVEST YOUR MONEYIn our growth strategy, we have compartmentalized and budgeted various development milestones. We have identified all those points that need to be implemented, modified or improved. Thus, we have positioned them in such a way that their development means less investment, but at the same time they bring to the game a direct improvement of the player's engagement and return on investment. It is true that this world is our passion, but only if we manage to make the game self-sufficient we could continue making the project growing and improving its quality.Our dream is that this crowfunding campaign will give us enough funds to fully develop the vision that we have told you, but being realistic and starting at the beginning we have compartmentalized various phases of improvement and development that we will be able to carry out independently of each other with your help. PHASE 1. IMPROVE GRAPHIC AND USER ENGAGEMENT. 40,000 EUR .This first phase and that is the fundamental objective of the crowdfunding campaign will be to reformulate the graphic design and his quality, simplifying the internal structure of the game in order to improve its gameplay. In short, we want to improve the quality of the graphics and make playing much easier and more fun. What we'll do for it:

Redesign the art and design of many of the game's screens, creating a much cleaner, simpler and more intuitive UI.

Represent 3D embossed players during the match in the form of soda bottle plates. Cool eh!

Add customization elements for teams, new shields, t-shirts and items that are displayed during matches and allow you to create a skin of differentiation from other teams.

Create a series of equipment with special powers that you can take to each match and improve certain parameters of your team (resistance, speed, strength...). These kits will be ranked in different levels and will be unlocked as the team moves up from the league.

Improve visual effects when PowerUps are released during matches.
Create a simpler and more didactic interactive tutorial. Where every coach starts at a school for coaches and receives a hands-on session of all the sections he must know of the game, before going to the open sea to compete against other players.
 
PHASE 2. 3D REPRESENTATION OF MATCHES AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE GAME AI.  +60,000 EUR.
This second phase continues to deepen into the user experience, its engagement and gameplay. On the one hand, we want the matches to have a real 3D representation to improve the player's immersion in the match, and to be able to better see the tactics of your opponent, and on the other hand develop the algorithm of the game so that it has all the essential elements of a match football. See bellow our proposal for the future evolution of the game play! 

 

3D representation of football matches, giving the player the option to watch the match from different perspectives to be able to better analyse the tactics employed by the rivals.

Improve the AI of the game by continuing with the development of the algorithm that gives it life. In this phase, all the sections of a football match that have not been able to be implemented, such as fouls, offsides, corners, kicks, penalties, etc. will be added to the game.

A real-time monitor will be developed to represent the average attack and defence of your team and your rival. This will give the manager information during the match of how they evolve and affect the attack and defines of the decisions that are made, as well as the release of Power Ups.
An individualized graphical representation of the use of each PowerUp will be designed.
 
PHASE 3. EVOLUTION TO A TOTAL FOOTBALL MANAGER.  +250,000 EUR.
In this third phase, we want to evolve the functionalities of the game towards a Total Football Manager. Improving not only the management options of the sports plot, but also introducing new management areas, such as the economic, managerial, social and marketing areas of a club. Because we know that winning matches is cool but putting on Abramovich's shoes one day is cool so much more!
Programming the game on servers: To be able to bring life the management of all these areas and that interconnect among all users it is necessary that the information is accessible to all users. This only happens if the game is programmed and runs directly from the cloud, not on each of the mobile devices as it does now. Thus, we will schedule a new version of the game that meets the necessary requirements so that all users can be connected in a global community of Managers, perform transfers of players, stadiums, shields, etc.
Improved management of Sport Area:

Scout team and affiliate team: The club will be equipped with a scouting team who will be in charge of finding young promises to incorporate them into the club and evolve them into stars worldwide. The possibility of managing a subsidiary team to grow these young promises will be introduced. Yes, because the next Messi is out there waiting for you to find him.

Transfer Market: Create a virtual market for player transfers and other game items. You can sell and buy everything from skins, Power Ups, coaches, doctors, to stadiums. Earn revenue from the sale of any assets in your club, and buy in the market all the necessary elements to make the team of your dreams a reality.

Technical Team: The sports strategy of the game will be developed to make it similar to that of any great football team today. Physical preparers, psychologists, doctors, defensive, offensive, tactical coach, etc. Only by hiring the best professionals it's possible to optimize the evolution of your players by creating a highly competitive team in all sports areas.

Sports facilities: Sports facilities (gym, training camps, nursing, etc.) can be created and improved to make the evolution and progression of players faster and more effective.



Incorporation of the Economic strategy

Economic Management of the team: Only optimal and effective management of your team will allow you to increase your annual budget to sign the best players in the world. Management of wage costs, termination clauses, ticket sales, advertising on T-shirts and in the stadium, sales of drinks and food, opening of new own stores, sponsorship contracts with sports brands, ... Football is sport and passion, but also a business. Optimize these plots and become the Tycoon of world football... let's Abramovich be a simple fan by your side.

Football Stadium: Turn your team's stadium into a world-class benchmark. Improve your club's revenue, sponsorship contracts and access to better competitions. It all starts in a schoolyard, struggles to see built the stadium of your dreams.

Official Stores: Create a network of official club stores that generate sufficient resources to keep the team and grow economically and socially.

Marketing and Sponsorship Contracts: The more your team grows, the better the contracts you will have access to, from sports brands to stadium names. Be creative to optimize this important economic plot and be able to balance the club's accounts.

Food and Refreshment Sales: Do not underestimate this method of obtaining recurring resources. Manage sales prices and procurement. The better your equipment is ranked, the better sales prices you can offer.



Incorporation of the Social&Media Area

Supporters: Manage relationships with fans, only keeping them happy will your relevance in media will be important. Hold events with the fans, promotional activities, etc. so that your social mass supports your team inside and outside the stadium.

Press and Public Relations: Designs an optimal media policy. Improve the mood of your players with a good relationship with the press.


 
PHASE 4. VISION COME TRUE.  +350,000 EUR.
Just thinking that this could be done makes us cry out. Being able to bring our vision to your devices thanks to your support is something we could never forget.The first thing to say is that this phase would be almost entirely dedicated to a backend phase, where substantial changes would arise from the implementation of a new game system that would allow players to monetize their skill and dedication to the game through a paid system of eSport Amateur championships, and the creation of a Real Market in a Virtual World, where you could sell in exchange for real money the digital assets that each of you has created (i.e. players, PowerUps, limited edition kits, etc.).Implementing this new game system generates significant investments to bring legitimacy and security to all transactions performed. While similar systems exist in other fields, such as online casinos, their adaptation to the world of video games is not standardized and is therefore difficult and expensive. The programming investment of this phase would be aimed at the creation of the following areas:

Creation of a paid system of championships and leagues: A system of tournaments and leagues must be implemented that allow the user to register in exchange for paying an entrance ticket. Depending on the player's evolution in the tournament, the profits earned will accrue in their individual account, which they can withdraw to their current account when they consider. A database with sufficient security and integrity must be programmed and maintained to ensure the legitimacy of all funds that are incorporated into the user's account as a result of their participation in paid tournaments.

Creating a Real Market in the Virtual World: How many hours we've spent playing our favourite video games to have better characters, better skins, unlock players, etc. And so far, they only served for the enjoyment of the user himself. Until now. At M&W we will create a real market in the virtual world, making all the digital assets that are created belong to the users themselves. Thus through a system of transfers and withdrawal clauses you can put in value your players, stadiums, coaches, PoweUps, Skins, etc. And if you are able to create the next CR7 or Messi the market should recognize it. Okay, maybe you'll get up one morning and Messi's disappeared from your club... ?  but in return you will have obtained a few dollars that you can deposit into your bank account whenever you want to ?. We all know that our time is worth money, but from now on you can charge for it. What do you think, you sign up?

Creating a two-way payment gateway: As the last step of the roadmap, a two-way payment gateway must be incorporated within the game, so that you can receive in your current account the revenue generated by your tournament triumphs or sale of digital assets. In the world of video games, you can count on the fingers of the hand adventurers who have incorporated a similar reward system. We must program and incorporate our own payment gateway that is totally reliable and secure for our users.
 OUR PRINCIPLES AND VALUESLast but not least, we want to share with you the principles and values that motivate each of the decisions we make.These values fulfill define (promised) our games and our commitment to you and this wonderful world of video games. “It’s all about the player”Our main and only obsession is for players to enjoy the game, having fun by simply spending a moment of happiness. Getting that little smile on your mouth be drawned while you're playing, that's just our purpose. In this sense, you have our firm promise that all the decisions we make will have as a reference to improve the quality of your gaming experience. And we will accept all the criticisms you give us when we are wrong. yes, yes, we know we are all human and at some point we will screw up... ""Games for the years”Who don’t remember those great titles of our youth like 'Street Fighter 2', PC Football, Commandos, etc., and not as old as WOW, Clash of Clans, ... many of which we continue playing regularly even if they have a few years behind them.We want MANAGE & WIN to become a benchmark of the 'League Manager', through which the years pass like good wines, improving the present.Today Mobile games have an incredible advantage over traditional games, they can be subject to updates without any restrictions for years, being able to surprise players constantly. MANAGE&WIN is and will always be constantly evolving. That's our commitment, first the players, and for this we will constantly invest much of our resources. We're here to stay, only if you want to. ""Skill before jam” In other words, the ability before the filly.We want players' ability to determine their victories. To do this we develop our games with an algorithm with zero randomness (yes zero-zero, promised). Success will never be based on luck again. And at the same time defeats will have to be accepted without any excuse... do you accept the challenge? ""Bug Busters”The first thing a game has to do is to work perfectly, without any programming flaws. We are aware of our human condition - we hope you too - and we know that at some point or another we will make failures in development. We apologize in advance, and promise that we will resolve them as soon as possible. However, we like to believe that mistakes make us better than we were before, so to paraphrase an Edison ""I haven't failed 999 times, I've just found 999 ways how not to create a light bulb."" If you have come this far we want to thank you for the time you have spent valuing our project. Whether you decide to support us financially or not, thanks to people like you, passionate about this world, we find our motivation to continue fighting to make this dream come true. From the heart, thank you very much from the entire M&W team.",25.0,6,"1 Campaign

Fast-paced and colorful, it's easy to pick up but with enough tactical depth to satisfy even the most hardcore fans of the genre.Our current aim is to secure enough funding to make a fully playable demo version of the game, a chance for players to experience for themselves how the final product will feel and play. We plan to include two characters with full move-sets, artwork and backstory.RISE AND SHINE!Obsessed with discovering the secret to eternal life, the nefarious Dr K has spent decades tinkering with human and animal DNA in his secret laboratory. Now the results of his previous experiments are threatening to come back to bite him in a frighteningly literal way…Now, from his private island of Waki Waki, he invites a selection of supernatural warriors and his own failed experiments to compete in a fighting tournament for a prize that none of them can refuse.  OFF THE BOX & ON THE RAMPAGE!  ""You might wanna buckle in, things are about to get Grrrrr-uesome!Terror T was a GI during the last days of the Vietnam War. Mortally wounded, he was placed in the care of the notorious Dr K and revived using the DNA of a Sumatran tiger and the doctor’s “Secret Recipe,” gaining the beast-like characteristics of a Tiger in the process.Don’t let his bulky stature fool you, he’s a precise heavy hitter who can fire off a flurry of fist and claw-based attacks to shred his enemies to pieces. And just like a tiger, he knows how to draw in his prey for the kill...Gameplay: Terror T will have a rush down play style so make sure to utilize his tools to get in on your opponent’s and overwhelm them with pressure! Once you’re in you’ll have to commit so make sure you have a plan of attack!   ""The day you cross Mclucky, is the day you'r luck runs out.""When the fairy folk left Ireland, they refused to take the murderous McLucky with them, cursing him instead to wander the realm of man forever. Now the only way he can gain enough power to open a doorway to the otherworld is by defeating powerful rivals and imprisoning their souls within the many grisly ‘charms’ he carries about his person.Mclucky likes to keep his distance. Using the magical abilities of his charms, he focuses on projectile based assaults to throw his enemies off guard before closing in for the finishing blow!Gameplay: McLucky will have a zoning play style easily keeping his opponents out but he knows how to put on the pressure. Make sure to utilize his long range normals appropriately but be careful that randomly throwing out attacks can result in big punishes! Will there be more characters in the future?While the Demo will initially focus on Terror T and Mclucky, should we meet our stretch goals, we'll be able to implement even more characters getting us closer to a full build of the game!​ GAMEPLAY STYLE:*Not Final DesignCereal Killaz will have 4 button system which is Light, Medium, & Heavy attack, along with a “skill” button. For the demo, this will be a 1v1 style fighting game that will play similarly to the versus series. Meaning lots of chain combos on the ground and air. Each character will have a variety of special moves and supers for all kinds of crazy combos.The Demo will only focus on localized play, however online play is planned for a potential full game release. Our Demo will also feature:  
2 player localized VS experience, 
A brief tutorial story mode unique to both Terry and McLucky (as well as stretch goal characters if those goals are met.)

A special bonus stage vs the endurable punching box Training Oates! Gameplay Mechanics:Skill/Technique Button: A skill button is a mechanic that will add something unique to a character. These skills can give a character a boost in damage, a new attack, or an extra move to help them maneuver around in a match.Throws: Each character will have a forward and back throw. This is something most of you should be familiar with!Special Moves: Each character will have a variety of special attacks integrated in their move-set. Enhanced versions of a special move will cost half a bar of meter.Super Moves: Each character will have a level 1 super(s) and level 3 super.Break -Fast: This is a mechanic that is used in tough situations. If you are feeling the pressure and want your opponent to get off you, spend 1 bar of meter to push them off.  If they really annoy you spend 2 bars of meter to push them off and follow up with a full combo!*Names Not finalized

<p>    The Dead Division is a multiplayer survival RPG game that’s situated in the near future. The player will became a leader of one of the groups, which have survived deadly disease, and they must build a settlement to provide them with security from the outside threats. The game will run on a 12-hour cycle and will include seasonal changes. Every change of weather and also the day/night changes will affect the course of the game. These changes will randomly change the difficulty. The game will be based on the real use of electric and thermal energy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>BUILD YOUR SETTLEMENT</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    Build a safe hideout for your people from the remains of a former settlement, where they can defend themselves even from the greatest threats. With a growing settlement, new opportunities will open up for the player, that will help him get food, produce weapons for defense and hunting, and allow you to become self-sufficient. In addition, it will allow you to trade with merchants visiting the settlement.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RADIO TOWERS</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    Although the construction of a radio tower takes a certain amount of players time, it’s completion will give the player possibility to chat with other players. Individual players will be able to communicate with each other through chat, which will include private messages and chat with other players on the map. The towers will have to be repaired as all other buildings, either as a result of attacks or due to bad weather. If it is damaged enough, the player will lose not only the minimap but also the possibility to communicate with other players. You will need to make the necessary corrections to reconnect, but this will take several times bigger amount of time. If the player does not do so, he will only see the nearby surroundings of his settlement.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>METEOROLOGICAL STATION</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    In The dead divison weather will have a major impact on the game's progress. The climate changes, that our planet has undergone in recent decade, have caused extreme weather events over a period of time. Thanks to the weather station, the player will know what the weather will be like in the next 7 days, allowing him to react quickly to changes and prepare himself for them. Thanks to the weather knowledge, he will also be able to capture the right time to send explorers to areas outside the settlement. The accuracy of the forecast will decrease with each subsequent day of the forecast. The forecast will provide the player with informations about current temperature, weather and current game time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>CURRENCY AND TRADE</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    Medicaments are the official game currency, replacing worthless money from pre-disaster times. Vaccines will serve as premium currencies. Once certain conditions have been met, the player will be able to trade with the corporation and will gain the access to weapons and technology that he or she cannot normally obtain. The player will be free to choose whether he will use the vaccines for trading, or to remove the symptoms of his fellow workers affected by the disease. Untreatment of the disease will result in death and the need to teach a new expert in the field. Learning will take some time and will have a negative impact on the running of the settlement. Therefore, a player should consider being willing to take such a risk.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ITEMS</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    There are currently about 100 items in the game. Their base consists of simple weapons, components to simplify the life of settlers and materials needed for their production. The player will acquire them by looting objects, eventually making them by the right combination of items.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556577362/obalsyebtnbecgkmd7j1.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>MAP DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    The map will contain approximately 100 sectors. Each of them will have different sizes and different living conditions. The sectors will be divided into those in which players will have the possibility to build a settlement and those in which hostile raiders will be located. The remaining sectors will include unexplored areas in which settlers will be able to obtain the raw materials and objects needed to run the settlements. Individual parts of the map will gradually unlock with the arrival of new patches. ! THE FINAL VERSION OF THE MAP CAN BE DIFFERENT FROM THE CURRENT ONE AND WITH NEW UPDATES IT WILL CHANGE ITS DESIGN!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>LOOTING SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    Acquisition of items will be done by sending explorers to areas outside the settlement. Upon arrival of the explorer at the destination, the player will receive a notification and a list of items found. An explorer may be attacked by enemy raiders or undead during his mission. In case of danger it will be up to the player whether he will stands up to the enemy or runs away and leaves objects found behind. Explorers will provide the resources needed to run the settlement. They will even provide the player with informations about newly found areas and treasures that hides in them, and help reveal the past that preceded the disaster. For some information, it will be possible to obtain medicines, vaccines or equipment from the corporation. In the future, we plan to change the looting system to make it more interactive. The player will have to manually search through the individual objects, and will depend on his observation skills whether he finds all the objects that are there. There may be a situation where the noise will bring unwanted guests to react.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>CRAFTING</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    Convert seemingly useless waste to weapons and useful items to help you survive and protect yourself from danger. Grow your own plants and with the help of research create stimulants that will heal injuries or temporarily improve settlers' performance in different ways.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>UPGRADE</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    Each building in the settlement will have a number of improvements, thanks to which, for example, would be possible to increase food production, improve settlement defense, or speed up explorers on the map. Weapons will also have several levels of enhancement that will only be available to the player after the conditions for their research will be met. At the same time, the player will have to manually perform simple repairs and use the raw materials obtained to maintain them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EXTENSION OF ITEMS</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>​-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>    By expanding the number of items, players will be given new opportunities to increase the chance of successful run of the settlement and settlers security. New items will be added that will be necesary for completion of quests and to make progress on storyline, and new technology enhancements and weapons that the player will be able to obtain from the corporation. New crafting components will also be added.</p>

They will be threatened not only by frequent undead and outlaws attacks, but also by their opponents for approximately 10 minutes. The winner team will be the one, that will manage to get a better score, based on the amount of raw materials obtained, enemies killed, and the level of their settlement.</p>

    The Dead Division is a multiplayer survival RPG game that’s situated in the near future. The player will became a leader of one of the groups, which have survived deadly disease, and they must build a settlement to provide them with security from the outside threats. The game will run on a 12-hour cycle and will include seasonal changes. Every change of weather and also the day/night changes will affect the course of the game. These changes will randomly change the difficulty. The game will be based on the real use of electric and thermal energy.
​-------------------------------------------
BUILD YOUR SETTLEMENT
​-------------------------------------------
    Build a safe hideout for your people from the remains of a former settlement, where they can defend themselves even from the greatest threats. With a growing settlement, new opportunities will open up for the player, that will help him get food, produce weapons for defense and hunting, and allow you to become self-sufficient. In addition, it will allow you to trade with merchants visiting the settlement.
​-------------------------------------------
RADIO TOWERS
​-------------------------------------------
    Although the construction of a radio tower takes a certain amount of players time, it’s completion will give the player possibility to chat with other players. Individual players will be able to communicate with each other through chat, which will include private messages and chat with other players on the map. The towers will have to be repaired as all other buildings, either as a result of attacks or due to bad weather. If it is damaged enough, the player will lose not only the minimap but also the possibility to communicate with other players. You will need to make the necessary corrections to reconnect, but this will take several times bigger amount of time. If the player does not do so, he will only see the nearby surroundings of his settlement.
​-------------------------------------------
METEOROLOGICAL STATION
​-------------------------------------------
    In The dead divison weather will have a major impact on the game's progress. The climate changes, that our planet has undergone in recent decade, have caused extreme weather events over a period of time. Thanks to the weather station, the player will know what the weather will be like in the next 7 days, allowing him to react quickly to changes and prepare himself for them. Thanks to the weather knowledge, he will also be able to capture the right time to send explorers to areas outside the settlement. The accuracy of the forecast will decrease with each subsequent day of the forecast. The forecast will provide the player with informations about current temperature, weather and current game time.
​-------------------------------------------
CURRENCY AND TRADE
​-------------------------------------------
    Medicaments are the official game currency, replacing worthless money from pre-disaster times. Vaccines will serve as premium currencies. Once certain conditions have been met, the player will be able to trade with the corporation and will gain the access to weapons and technology that he or she cannot normally obtain. The player will be free to choose whether he will use the vaccines for trading, or to remove the symptoms of his fellow workers affected by the disease. Untreatment of the disease will result in death and the need to teach a new expert in the field. Learning will take some time and will have a negative impact on the running of the settlement. Therefore, a player should consider being willing to take such a risk.
​-------------------------------------------
ITEMS
​-------------------------------------------
    There are currently about 100 items in the game. Their base consists of simple weapons, components to simplify the life of settlers and materials needed for their production. The player will acquire them by looting objects, eventually making them by the right combination of items.
 

​-------------------------------------------
MAP DESIGN
​-------------------------------------------
    The map will contain approximately 100 sectors. Each of them will have different sizes and different living conditions. The sectors will be divided into those in which players will have the possibility to build a settlement and those in which hostile raiders will be located. The remaining sectors will include unexplored areas in which settlers will be able to obtain the raw materials and objects needed to run the settlements. Individual parts of the map will gradually unlock with the arrival of new patches. ! THE FINAL VERSION OF THE MAP CAN BE DIFFERENT FROM THE CURRENT ONE AND WITH NEW UPDATES IT WILL CHANGE ITS DESIGN!
​-------------------------------------------
LOOTING SYSTEM
​-------------------------------------------
    Acquisition of items will be done by sending explorers to areas outside the settlement. Upon arrival of the explorer at the destination, the player will receive a notification and a list of items found. An explorer may be attacked by enemy raiders or undead during his mission. In case of danger it will be up to the player whether he will stands up to the enemy or runs away and leaves objects found behind. Explorers will provide the resources needed to run the settlement. They will even provide the player with informations about newly found areas and treasures that hides in them, and help reveal the past that preceded the disaster. For some information, it will be possible to obtain medicines, vaccines or equipment from the corporation. In the future, we plan to change the looting system to make it more interactive. The player will have to manually search through the individual objects, and will depend on his observation skills whether he finds all the objects that are there. There may be a situation where the noise will bring unwanted guests to react.
​-------------------------------------------
CRAFTING
​-------------------------------------------
    Convert seemingly useless waste to weapons and useful items to help you survive and protect yourself from danger. Grow your own plants and with the help of research create stimulants that will heal injuries or temporarily improve settlers' performance in different ways.
​-------------------------------------------
UPGRADE
​-------------------------------------------
    Each building in the settlement will have a number of improvements, thanks to which, for example, would be possible to increase food production, improve settlement defense, or speed up explorers on the map. Weapons will also have several levels of enhancement that will only be available to the player after the conditions for their research will be met. At the same time, the player will have to manually perform simple repairs and use the raw materials obtained to maintain them.
​-------------------------------------------
EXTENSION OF ITEMS
​-------------------------------------------
    By expanding the number of items, players will be given new opportunities to increase the chance of successful run of the settlement and settlers security. New items will be added that will be necesary for completion of quests and to make progress on storyline, and new technology enhancements and weapons that the player will be able to obtain from the corporation. New crafting components will also be added.
 

 

​-------------------------------------------
1000$ - SOUND EFFECTS WITH BETTER QUALITY
​-------------------------------------------
    At the moment, we are unable to create our own audio material for the game, and we are reliant solely on free sound effects. Your support will allow us to purchase higher quality effects that will enhance the game experience.
​-------------------------------------------
1500$ - STORY
​-------------------------------------------
    The game will include a full story in which the player reveals a past that explains the origin of the disease and the events before the epidemic. Proceeding in the story finds out what future the fate prepared for him. All of the important informations the player will gain through collecting newspaper articles, dialogs with other survivors and by performing tasks. The story will gradually evolve by unlocking new locations.
​-------------------------------------------
2000$ - SUPPORT FOR ANDROID AND IOS
​-------------------------------------------
    Create an application that allows players to run The Dead Division on their mobile devices and tablets.
​-------------------------------------------
2500$ - MULTIPLAYER
​-------------------------------------------
    Multiplayer will contain multiple modes, depending on the number of players. They will be able to try how difficult it is to build a better, prosperous and safer settlement. One mode will be tower defense, in which players will need to manage the common territory and work together to survive. They will be threatened not only by frequent undead and outlaws attacks, but also by their opponents for approximately 10 minutes. The winner team will be the one, that will manage to get a better score, based on the amount of raw materials obtained, enemies killed, and the level of their settlement.
​-------------------------------------------
4000$ - CLAN
​-------------------------------------------
    The possibility to start a clan will cost the player a one-time fee, with which he will also be given the opportunity to win vaccines depending on the success against the rival clans. The clan leader will be responsible for distributing the work they entrust to individual players such as exploration, defense, and collection of raw materials. Clan mode will be different from normal campaigns, among other things, by having to build a completely new settlement and the freedom to deploy individual buildings. The clan will include game modes that will differ from classic multiplayer and collaboration.
 

    Its still more than half year befor the releasing an alpha version of the game, so why did we chose Indiegogo. The reason is simple, we need a feedback. Indiegogo is giving us an oportunite to see if The Dead Division will be played by nowadays players, or if it will die without anyone noticing it. Next thing is a money. Indiegogo will provide us with the most important thing to run a game, the money support. The amount of money will decide what should be our biggest priority. Another thing is time. Making a game needs a lot of time, and that is exactly what we need. 
 


    Received money will be used to pay things connected with crowdfunding, like fees for Indiegogo services, fees for money exhange and taxes. Part of the money will be used to pay the rent for the server and costs connected witch project leading, for example equipments upgrade. We belive that more than half of the goal mone will be acquired. Your financial support will help us with recruiting more people to our development group, which will speed the whole work.

<h3>The Ultimate Gamer Dream</h3>
<p>Ever since we were little kids we have made video games part of our lives. Some of them were so fun that we spent entire afternoons playing them, others had such amazing stories and characters that we even dreamed about living in their worlds and fighting alongside them.</p>
<p>Growing up in the late 80's, 90's and the first decade of the 21st century gave us a unique opportunity to experience the best of each gaming console, either a brand new Nintendo™, Xbox™ or PlayStation™, or an inherited one from our parents or relatives, that old Atari™, Sega™ or Intellivision™ that we didn't quite understand but was super fun to play with . We got to see the best of the Arcade era, the Console era and the Online era. We went from proving ourselves who was the best through a High Score in the Arcade Room to Online Ranking Systems and Online Co-op.</p>
<p>And so we got together with a dream, to create an event where the best experiences of each era could coexist whilst bringing new ideas to it. To create the Ultimate Gamer Dream, give back to the community that has given us so much our entire lives and take video game events to the next level.</p>

<h3>Taking Video Game Events to the Next Level</h3>
<p>When we look at video game or e-sports events today we see two things. First, the competitive level is amazing, the best of each game clashing, fighting or shooting their way to glory, some gameplays are breathtaking and make us jump out of our seats, which brings us to our second point; The audience, modern video game events and e-sports competitions focus their attention on a tournament, hence the audience turns into a passive bystander of the action occurring. Sure, we enjoy watching these amazing matches, but there's always this little voice in our heads that says ""You could do this better"" or ""You wouldn't have chosen that combo or skill"".</p>
<p>EXP Fest wants to change this, by giving the audience an active role during the event we want to encourage friendly competitive matches all over the arena. Our team is developing a Mobile App that will integrate the best of vintage arcade gaming and modern technologies into one awesome experience for everyone attending EXP Fest. By empowering the audience we break the paradigm of top-level competitive gaming and divide the event into Amateur and Pro Tournaments. Just go play the games you love, earn EXP and level up to obtain amazing rewards, just like 80's and 90's Arcade Rooms.</p>
<p>The idea is to have an event that involves more than one game at a time. We have categorized e-sport competitive gaming into 5 genres: Massive Online Battle Arena (MOBA), First Person Shooter (FPS), Real Time Strategy (RTS), Fighting and Sports; with a bonus 'Vintage' category. This will give EXP Fest's attendants 6 different ways to prove their worth, level up their EXP Badges™ and attain Ultimate Gaming Honor and the rewards that come with glory.</p>

<h3>Choose Your Class</h3>
<p>We believe that there are many kinds of gamers, casual Friday-night, hardcore Cap-level ones, vintage lovers, FPS fans, Online gamers, Couch co-op enthusiasts; and so we are bringing something everyone can enjoy. We might have disagreements on which game or console is the best, but one thing all gamers agree on is the fact that practice makes perfect. Bring your skills to the party and level up the EXP Badge™ of your favorite genre, or be the overlord of the event and try to master all genres, but beware, competition will be fierce and the spoils of war not easily taken.</p>
<p>The EXP Development Team firmly believes that everyone has a unique set of skills and so we put up together a great party where everyone has a role, meet the team and what they bring to the table:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482105305/pz8qzku0imkv4nazqz7i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short-term and Mid-term Goals</h3>
<p>Our dream is to make EXP Fest a recurring event that takes place in a different city each time. In order to do that we need resources, partners and new team members. This campaign targets all those elements.<br/>The money we raise through this campaign will be used to add new team members; as in every Role Playing Game out there, each class has a different set of skills, and they are all needed in order to accomplish the objectives, so does EXP Fest, we need a team of Developers to help shape-up the Mobile App that will set the difference between our event and the ones out there, we need a Marketing team that help us contact Sponsors for the event, as well as spreading the word about our features to gamers all over the world so they can jump in and help or enjoy the event once it is out there. A Logistics team in charge of setting up the arena for the event as well as contacting Pro-Teams interested in participating in Pro Tournaments.</p>
<p>The equipment needed to create the Mobile App is very simple but very much needed, you cannot go hunt for End-game loot using your Lv. 1 Wooden Sword, so we need to upgrade our equipment in order to achieve the event all gamers dream of. A video game event made by true gamers.</p>
<p>Our creative team came up with some visualization ideas for the Mobile App*, don't share this link with our Mobile Developers, it might create a dispute that needs to be settled at Final Destination:</p>

<p>So, as massive fans of business simulation games like Capitalism, Transport Tycoon and Ports of call, we are planning to take this to the next level, and create an MMO where you do much of the same stuff as you did in these games, but in competition with thousands of other players all over the world.</p>
<p>In the initial verson of the game, you will be given 3 main avenues to achieve the goal of being the fattest cat around; Industry, Transport and Trade.</p>
<p>After launch we are planning to roll out expansions every 6 months, that will be free, expanding this to include things like Real Estate, Investment Banking, Retail and possibly even more shady avenues. In a sandbox, only your imagination is the limit.</p>
<h3>Industry</h3>
<p>Build and manage factories, improve them, hire workers and managers. As a new player, limited capital and skills will force you to start small, but play your cards right and before you knw it you may be sitting on a manufacturing empire. Succeeding in the industrial field will require you to both compete, sometimes agressively, and cooperate with other players.</p>
<p>Will you micromanage your empire yourself, or will you hire managers to take some of the load? Will you buy raw materials off the market, or strike deals with other players who can supply them at a better price? How will you get materials transported to your factories, and how will you get your goods transported to the consumers?</p>
<p>Do you place your factories in a less desirable town, where it is cheaper to hire workers and buy land, but you might have trouble selling your goods locally and have to ship it further? Or will you spend more on your workforce to save on transport costs? How about upgrades and automation?</p>
<p>The list goes on and on, and succeeding will not be as simple as it might sound.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523056613/r7brrc6zgygb4xs3smvk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Transport</h3>
<p>Perhaps your dream is to be a shipping magnate? In an open world with thousands of players and NPCs there will always be an abundance of goods and raw materials that needs to be transported quickly, safely and cheaply. You will have to decide if you want to be focused, or full service.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will focus on trucking, and buy the services of rail companies, or do you ally yourself with another player focusing on railways, or on ships? Just remember to keep you fleet maintained and deliver on time. Your clients will be able to rate your performance, and those ratings will be visible to prospective clients!</p>
<p>It is however not just goods and materials that needs to be moved. Public transport is also an option you may want to look into. Perhaps an airline is more up your alley? Or a Cruise Line? Just make sure you don’t beat up your passengers and throw them off the plane!</p>
<p>Transporting people can be done in two ways. You can accept city contracts, perhaps running a citys bus service, or you can operate on the open market. Buy a plane, set up a route between two cities, and hope the passengers will choose you over the competition. The NPC passengers will base their choice on price, brand recognition and brand reputation.</p>
<p>Brand reputation is a stat based on your reliability and safety record. Keep your planes, trains and buses running on time, avoid accidents, and your reputation will increase, making more passengers prefer your service over those with lower reputation, to some extent even if you charge higher ticket prices.</p>
<h3>Trade</h3>
<p>Buy low, sell high. It’s easy right? If it was, we’d all be doing it in the real world aswell. The world of trading is one of massive risk, and potentially massive rewards.</p>
<p>The One Percent boasts a fully functional stock market that includes both NPC and player corporations. The moment you create a character and your corporation, it is automatically added to the listing. Your share price will then fluctuate naturally based on factors like net value of your corporation, profitability and trade volume.</p>
<p>There is also a commodity market where you can buy and sell goods and raw materials in bulk. Especially in the raw material market this opens up potential for cooperation and negotiation between players. Do you buy the raw materials your factories need off the market, or can you negotiate a better deal directly with a player producing them?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Are you sure this will work?</h3>
<p>No new game can be completely certain it will be a success. We do however focus on creating a game WE would like to play, and as we're not self centered enough to believe we are one of a kind, the fact that we would like to play it, and people we talk to wants to play it, makes us confident there are many out there like us.</p>
<p>To ensure we deliver a product that will succeed, we also invite you to actively take part in the development of the game. Have an idea or feedback on one of ours? Something you would like to see in the game? We would LOVE to hear about it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can I help without spending money?</h3>
<p>Not everyone has the loose cash to back our project financially, and we fully appreciate that. There are however other ways you can help us along the way, and be a part of making the One Percent.</p>

<h3>THIS IS ABOUT ME - JUST A GUY.</h3>
<p>My name is Radames Medeiros, 30, creative director / ""jack of all trades"". From Earth like you. For the past 11 years i worked with something that people ""hates"" &gt;&gt; ads. So I decided it was time to stop all that and do something that I liked and motivated people. Curious as I have always been, I have always been easy to learn everything, I began 2 years ago to venture into making games, but I’ve spent years narrating table rpg games and playing, always playing, rpgs of the most varied  kinds,  creating worlds, systems and narratives. As an advertiser I created several pieces and I even had some winning scripts, but that does not count here. based on all my knowledge and skills acquired until then. See, I'm not bragging about anything, but since there is an internet I visit tutorials and learn things, simple as that. These abilities enabled me to create - what you will now see - practically alone. (I would like to stress that when I say ""Alone"" I mean the main job. I would not be where I am today without help from other people). It was only in 2017 that I took the courage to abandon all advertising life and devote full time to development, even though my base is still the art direction I can produce interesting things (I think.). Well, life is a box of surprises, some of you must know that and along with all this 2017 also brought me depression, invaded my house, my father had an avc, there were two cases of cancer in the family, my paternal grandmother died 1 week after our reunion more than 10 years away. Other than that life here is not very easy, my father, mother and maternal grandmother (85 years old) struggle hard to survive, it was my duty to raise my head and pursue the dream / work that I always wanted. Many struggled for this and I should sacrifice myself and strive for double. And that's how I did it, since four months have passed. I have many joys to share now, work happily 24/7 and have been inspiring people to pursue their dreams too.</p>
<p>I have only a few desires and duties that I want to share with you: I would like with this campaign to be able to put more people on this boat that I navigate. Developing alone is good on the one hand, but I want to offer more quality to you, put my ideas at the level I see. Directing art and doing art do not always go hand in hand, although I can exemplify my visions, more skillful people could accomplish them better than I do. In addition I would like the intense participation of the community whenever possible, as I make this game for you. So they have fun and have a piece of what they want for their life somewhere.</p>
<p>It is very easy to talk to me if you wish, my contacts will be at the end of this project and I would very much like your opinion and ideas.</p>

The game is separated into 8 stages, each phase containing 2 stages, 1 mini-boss and 1 boss. These levels will be produced jointly with the community and released episodically, always in pairs, until all are complete. Players traverse the maps to find the portals that lead to bosses, accumulate experience that leads to increase Mana (main attribute of the game that defines the basic attributes of the character as it increases), evolve skills and enable transformations by collecting 3 different types of Mana, which are adapted to the style that the player chooses (Fire, wind and water / melee, speed and distance), besides being able to count on the aid of Summons acquired when defeating the mini-bosses and extra powers granted by the masks collected by defeating the main bosses. The game also features some mini-games and puzzles, such as races, chases, secret places to visit. Each phase contains about 30 minutes of gameplay, totaling 320 minutes of gameplay on average. The player will travel through 3 planets of different dimensions and times until they complete all and be able to enable the last challenge.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><strong>Don't be afraid! Mana is everything.</strong></u><br/>While you have your Mana stock full you 're virtually imortal and more the Mana don't have a ""limit"". So while you are accumulating more mana you'll be more powerfull. </li>
<li><u><i><strong>I've planned transfomations to be a expression of your power!</strong></i></u></li>
<li><u><strong>When was the last time you completed a game?</strong></u></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">How about playing quietly and get to the end, record that gameplay, edit the video and still have time to go out with friends? The Intern looks on two fronts: TIME / BENEFIT. Of course if you spend more time inside the game you will have greater benefits but if you are that casual player who just wants to enjoy the story and get to the end of it all. This game is for you too!</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
</div><div>
<p>The game tells the story of a girl on <strong>a journey through dimensions / worlds / universes / parallel times.</strong> She is ""plucked"" from her common life (newly formed job-seeking and frustrated with life, living in a world where everything is boring) after receiving a special message inviting her to get a gray bus that would take her to compete for a vacancy, she desperately runs after the opportunity. What the girl did not expect is that this search for this bus would take her, in the middle of a storm to visit another dimension.<br/><strong>After crossing the continuous space-time</strong>, it plunges into another world, where it knows its ally, the mask of truth. The mysterious mask unites the protagonist by releasing his power and controlling his mind and body. The truth enables the intricate young woman to release and accumulate the <strong>Mana </strong>that exists in all things, as well as grant special skills and knowledge directly to the wearer. The other world is a wonderful place, in fact it is one of several dimensions and times, an island of floating stones, very green and abundant and also dangerous life. True, the mask guides the protagonist through this wonderful world in order to reach the competitors the mysterious wave, but fails to arrive too late to the portal. It is when the young woman discovers that she is not alone there, that the message was actually a summoning and that this whole situation was part of a larger test in order to gather all 4 masks that control the <strong>Mana</strong> of things. The young woman's goal becomes clear, although she is still reluctant, even knowing everything the mask knows, she still did not ""believe"". Far from the truth, but confident in getting ""The Job"" she enters the portal willing to follow her new companion.<br/>This is where the real adventure begins, our protagonist sets out to gather the four masks without knowing that such an objective was necessary to take on a very important job.</p>

<p>Everything that I'll show now it's the evolutions and the point that the game is right now after 4 mounths of solo development. I want to improve everything in the polish stage, so disregard what is in the moment and imagine what can come with your support. At the end of the project I will leave my references: what I would like to follow in order to give quality to the project.</p>

<h3>WHY INDIEGOGO?</h3>
<p>Well. I don't want to make games cause i want to be rich. Far from this. I want make games to people have fun, to make their life a little more interesting, for inspiring. Of course I've expenses and plans, but 0 incoming. My family and friends 're my main backup and their are helping me on this journey. Deisi girl are working for free too right now and i'm living with my parents... So, why Indie gogo? Cause I want to give more quality and help who is helping me with the well deserved value of their work. I wish with that you can experience the best experience that my imagination and dedication can provide. With the Indiegogo I can put more people on the boat and help them with their dreams and searches! I Want to show for everyone that just a guy with help of the internet can make something good for the others. <br/>I have many ideals here you can make a difference too. With or without the success of the campaign I will continue the hard work and try to deliver my best to everyone.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I don't see risks in the development of the game because for me it is a personal goal to complete it, I will go to the end in one way or another. Whatever comes will be good.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Every day I have challenges in this development, discover new things, optimize, create contacts, tests and more tests, arts, everything has its share of tests. But that's what makes creating such a fun game, I believe.<br/>I'd like to implement some things too, procedural Skills tree, more worlds, more mechanics, deeper stories, breakable things, there is much that can be done. For now, I want to achieve what I have already said here, and if by chance many help this little world can become a multiverse.</p>

My name is Radames Medeiros, 30, creative director / ""jack of all trades"". From Earth like you. For the past 11 years i worked with something that people ""hates"" >> ads. So I decided it was time to stop all that and do something that I liked and motivated people. Curious as I have always been, I have always been easy to learn everything, I began 2 years ago to venture into making games, but I’ve spent years narrating table rpg games and playing, always playing, rpgs of the most varied  kinds,  creating worlds, systems and narratives. As an advertiser I created several pieces and I even had some winning scripts, but that does not count here. based on all my knowledge and skills acquired until then. See, I'm not bragging about anything, but since there is an internet I visit tutorials and learn things, simple as that. These abilities enabled me to create - what you will now see - practically alone. (I would like to stress that when I say ""Alone"" I mean the main job. I would not be where I am today without help from other people). It was only in 2017 that I took the courage to abandon all advertising life and devote full time to development, even though my base is still the art direction I can produce interesting things (I think.). Well, life is a box of surprises, some of you must know that and along with all this 2017 also brought me depression, invaded my house, my father had an avc, there were two cases of cancer in the family, my paternal grandmother died 1 week after our reunion more than 10 years away. Other than that life here is not very easy, my father, mother and maternal grandmother (85 years old) struggle hard to survive, it was my duty to raise my head and pursue the dream / work that I always wanted. Many struggled for this and I should sacrifice myself and strive for double. And that's how I did it, since four months have passed. I have many joys to share now, work happily 24/7 and have been inspiring people to pursue their dreams too.
I have only a few desires and duties that I want to share with you: I would like with this campaign to be able to put more people on this boat that I navigate. Developing alone is good on the one hand, but I want to offer more quality to you, put my ideas at the level I see. Directing art and doing art do not always go hand in hand, although I can exemplify my visions, more skillful people could accomplish them better than I do. In addition I would like the intense participation of the community whenever possible, as I make this game for you. So they have fun and have a piece of what they want for their life somewhere.
It is very easy to talk to me if you wish, my contacts will be at the end of this project and I would very much like your opinion and ideas.

Don't be afraid! Mana is everything.While you have your Mana stock full you 're virtually imortal and more the Mana don't have a ""limit"". So while you are accumulating more mana you'll be more powerfull. 
I've planned transfomations to be a expression of your power!
When was the last time you completed a game?

From the moment it was time to start working on the project I was very driven to get the first version of the demo done. It took a long time to finish and I worked completely independently, aside from the dialogue system code that my friend (@kallejillheden, aka “Jag”) wrote for me. When it was time to have the school exhibition I was so excited and it was a huge success!</p><p>After the exhibition I decided I wanted to remaster the demo. So I sat down and started working on it. This included making brand new graphics, adding new scenes, new characters and also some new music. During the course of production, @thatsicklypup joined the team as a writer; writing two new chapters of the game's story.</p><p>After months of working on polishing up the demo, I’m finally ready to take on the giant task of finishing the game.</p><p> </p><h3>So, what do you need?</h3><p>We have set our goal to $12,500 and every dollar will go to the people who work on this game, both current and new possible team members. Other things that are needed is new hardware (new PC), new software (renewed licences for programs), putting the game out on platforms like “Steam” etc, music (hopefully we can commission a full original soundtrack) and money for the work I put in as well, seeing how I as of right now have no other income. If the funding goes well and we earn more than expected, this might become my full time project!</p><p> </p><h3>Alright, so what are the perks?</h3><p>We have great perks for those who to decide to help us out early here! Many with multiple bonuses like for example;</p><p> </p><p><strong>Get your name in the credits!</strong></p><p>Get your name in the credits, a copy of the game, access to the old demo and a thank you message!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Get your character in the game!</strong></p><p>Ever dreamt of seeing your own character in the game, well look no further! With this perk you will get all the above and see yourself in-game in the background, a great opportunity for showing off in front of friends or family and maybe spark some interest in the game! This perk is limited to 10 slots though!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Get an Interactable Character in the game</strong></p><p>So just seeing your character in game isn’t enough? Well this is the perk for you.</p><p>This perk will get you your own non-playable character which the main character will be able talk to and possibly ask questions. This perk has 10 slots available and will include the previously mentioned perk!</p><p><strong>!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!</strong></p><p><strong>Both of the NPC character perks will require you to give your permission to slightly alter your character to fit the game. Changes might be putting a specific outfit on them or removing wings or other complicated attributes. We will both agree on a specific design that I feel is appropriate for the game, and then it will be inserted. Also, animal people only.</strong></p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Impact.</strong></h3><p>I feel this project is not only important for myself and my dreams but also for a bigger community as a whole, testing an old idea but with anthropomorphic characters that anyone, no matter the person's background can connect to!  I also want to offer a fresh new interesting game for the furry community who often don't get these kind of drama games, but also a generally cool visual novel for anyone who likes story games.</p><p>Just by contributing you will be part of this dream of mine and help this get to everyone!</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>The biggest obstacle we currently have is money, if we don’t get enough money it can slow down the process depending on how much we get, other obstacles can be if anyone under my employment or I get sick and if any hardware breaks down! The PC I have now is a laptop I got from high school and as wonderful as it is, I’m worried about it breaking down or crashing soon because it’s starting to get old.</p><p>But none of these will stop me from trying to complete this project, I have a love and passion for this game and rest assured knowing that I won’t stop working on this no matter the obstacle. No matter how the kickstarter goes, somehow, sometime I will finish this game.</p><p>That’s also why I have put the goal on where it is, mostly for a new PC and paying the people that work on it as well, to overcome any challenge that mostly comes in old hardware!</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><strong>I can’t donate, but I want to help!</strong></h3><p>We know that sometimes it’s hard to help a project financially but that’s not the only way you can help! You can share this campain on any platform to reach out to as many people as possible!

Recommend using middle mouse button!) So, what’s the story?""Outertown"" is a deep point and click visual novel in which you delve into the story of a bitter, juvenile cat's life and the challenges they face. In order to escape their past at Woodside Academy, they apply for an exchange programme at a whole new school dedicated to Fine Arts. There, they will find the welcoming cat Mira and listen to her story about her close relationship with the red panda, Charlie.Talk to interesting characters who all have their own story to tell and follow Mira’s story as you both try to uncover a huge mystery that has struck this small town of Elk Grove as well as the hometown of the main character, Woodside.How did it begin?This game spawned as my graduation project in game dev high school. From the moment it was time to start working on the project I was very driven to get the first version of the demo done. It took a long time to finish and I worked completely independently, aside from the dialogue system code that my friend (@kallejillheden, aka “Jag”) wrote for me. When it was time to have the school exhibition I was so excited and it was a huge success!After the exhibition I decided I wanted to remaster the demo. So I sat down and started working on it. This included making brand new graphics, adding new scenes, new characters and also some new music. During the course of production, @thatsicklypup joined the team as a writer; writing two new chapters of the game's story.After months of working on polishing up the demo, I’m finally ready to take on the giant task of finishing the game. So, what do you need?We have set our goal to $12,500 and every dollar will go to the people who work on this game, both current and new possible team members. Other things that are needed is new hardware (new PC), new software (renewed licences for programs), putting the game out on platforms like “Steam” etc, music (hopefully we can commission a full original soundtrack) and money for the work I put in as well, seeing how I as of right now have no other income. If the funding goes well and we earn more than expected, this might become my full time project! Alright, so what are the perks?We have great perks for those who to decide to help us out early here! Many with multiple bonuses like for example; Get your name in the credits!Get your name in the credits, a copy of the game, access to the old demo and a thank you message! Get your character in the game!Ever dreamt of seeing your own character in the game, well look no further! With this perk you will get all the above and see yourself in-game in the background, a great opportunity for showing off in front of friends or family and maybe spark some interest in the game! This perk is limited to 10 slots though! Get an Interactable Character in the gameSo just seeing your character in game isn’t enough? Well this is the perk for you.This perk will get you your own non-playable character which the main character will be able talk to and possibly ask questions. This perk has 10 slots available and will include the previously mentioned perk!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!Both of the NPC character perks will require you to give your permission to slightly alter your character to fit the game. Changes might be putting a specific outfit on them or removing wings or other complicated attributes. We will both agree on a specific design that I feel is appropriate for the game, and then it will be inserted. Also, animal people only. The Impact.I feel this project is not only important for myself and my dreams but also for a bigger community as a whole, testing an old idea but with anthropomorphic characters that anyone, no matter the person's background can connect to!  I also want to offer a fresh new interesting game for the furry community who often don't get these kind of drama games, but also a generally cool visual novel for anyone who likes story games.Just by contributing you will be part of this dream of mine and help this get to everyone! Risks & ChallengesThe biggest obstacle we currently have is money, if we don’t get enough money it can slow down the process depending on how much we get, other obstacles can be if anyone under my employment or I get sick and if any hardware breaks down! The PC I have now is a laptop I got from high school and as wonderful as it is, I’m worried about it breaking down or crashing soon because it’s starting to get old.But none of these will stop me from trying to complete this project, I have a love and passion for this game and rest assured knowing that I won’t stop working on this no matter the obstacle. No matter how the kickstarter goes, somehow, sometime I will finish this game.That’s also why I have put the goal on where it is, mostly for a new PC and paying the people that work on it as well, to overcome any challenge that mostly comes in old hardware!  I can’t donate, but I want to help!We know that sometimes it’s hard to help a project financially but that’s not the only way you can help! You can share this campain on any platform to reach out to as many people as possible! Just sharing this helps me out a lot and I am very grateful for that. ---cover picture made by @windseea!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Below I'll give you all the necessary info so you can decide if you want to support us ... or skip us in favor of some exploding zombie cat app. What is this campaign about?The purpose of this campaign is to complete the Blobbies' app for iOS and Android. Blobbies' App Main Screen This app is 75% complete and our goal is to ship it in May 2020. The app will have several sections including: the Blobbies' Personality Chart (where you can find out which Blobbie is most like you?) ...The Blobbies' Personality Chart ... the Blobbies' Shape Challenge (where you must learn and remember shapes to then battle the evil Hexacones) ...The Blobbies' Shape Challenge ... and the Blobbiemorph! game (a ""platformer"" [think Mario Bros.] where you must blobbiemorph into different animal shapes to survive all kinds of obstacles and enemies).Early prototype of the Blobbiemorph! Game (unfinished graphics). Ivi (my right hand) made a tour video of the app (the Blobbiemorf! game is not yet included).What are Blobbies®?Blobbies are friendly colorful beings that can change shape at will.  The seven Blobbie Colors Blobbies were introduced to the world via their book: “Here Come The Blobbies”, a sci-fi fantasy adventure that has received several awards in USA including a “Book of the Year” award from Creative Child Magazine. ""Here Come The Blobbies"" and some of its awards. Each Blobbie is the physical representation of one of the 7 rainbow colors and has a unique personality type based on that color. It's based on research on color theory, psychology, metaphysics, chakras, etc. (or to summarize: witchcraft!!!). Can you find out which Blobbie is most like you? What are these cool rewards I keep hearing about!?Besides having your name on the credits of the app, access to the beta, and the option to create your own game level, you could also receive one of these cool transforming plush toys:Blobbie Red • Blobbiemorpher Tyrannosaurus Blobbie Orange • Blobbiemorpher Eagle Blobbie Yellow • Blobbiemorpher Dolphin Blobbie Green • Blobbiemorpher Rabbit Blobbie Blue • Blobbiemorpher Triceratops Blobbie Indigo • Blobbiemorpher Stegosaurus Blobbie Violet • Blobbiemorpher Unicorn And here they are organized in reward levels (with WORLDWIDE FREE SHIPPING*): YOUR NAME in the Credits of the App + Beta Access + Blobbieapp + Boxed Minimorpher Pocket Toy (with Necklace, Stickers and Trading Card) + Signed Postcard. YOUR NAME in the Credits of the App + Beta Access + Blobbieapp + Boxed Blobbiemorpher (with Stickers, Trading Card and Certificate) + Peruvian Postcard. YOUR NAME in the Credits of the App + Beta Access + Blobbieapp + Boxed Blobbiemorpher (with Stickers, Trading Card and Certificate) + Polybagged Minimorpher Pocket Toy + Signed Postcard. YOUR NAME in the Credits of the App + Beta Access + Blobbieapp + Set of 3 Deluxe Minimorphers Pocket Toys + Signed Postcard. Your name HIGHLIGHTED in the Credits of the App + Beta Access + Blobbieapp +  Set of 7 Blobbiemorphers + 3 Deluxe Minimorphers + Book + Signed Postcard. CREATE YOUR OWN LEVEL+ Level Creator Credits + USB Blobbiedrive + 10 pcs Blobbiemundo TCG set (in Spanish) + Ultimate Blobbiecombo. The rewards are the Blobbiemorphers™, transforming plush toys that won a ""Toy of the Year"" award in the plush category and were selected as a ""Top Holiday Gift"" by Better Homes and Gardens magazine.Better Homes and Gardens mention and some of the Blobbiemorphers' awards. We used to sell them years ago, but we had to discontinue them because plush prices went up, the economy went down, and the cost of labor in China increased because factory workers demanded their human rights (and we support them! ...  but that didn't work to our advantage). If you want to read more about the story of the Blobbiemorphers, I wrote about an article for the Huffington Post. (FYI we have no political affiliation. The Blobbies love pledges from all political parties!).Mathias, blobbiefans, and Jadiel with their Blobbiemorphers! So, for this campaign we have decided to make a limited amount of Blobbiemorphers and give them as rewards! We'll be giving the 7 most popular designs: Red Tyrannosaurus, Orange Eagle, Yellow Dolphin, Green Rabbit, Blue Triceratops, Indigo Stegosaurus, and Violet Unicorn.All Seven Limited Edition Blobbiemorphers. These Blobbiemorphers are made of hypoallergenic velour, safe for kids 3 and up, 11 inches (28 cm) in height and much larger after they blobbiemorph.Marcela, Gerardo, and Valeria with their Minimorphers! We'll also give as rewards 3 models of Minimorphers™, the pocket version of the Blobbiemorphers,  only 3.5 inches (9 cm) in height. Sorry, not enough money to make all 7 colors ... maybe in a future campaign. Orange Eagle Minimorpher • Green Rabbit Minimorpher • Violet Unicorn Minimorpher We also have the Blobbiecombos which include many goodies such as hardcover Blobbiebooks, Blobbie USB drives, the Blobbiemundo TCG, and even the chance to create your own game level!*NOTE: Free worldwide delivery applies to most countries, some countries may require an additional fee. Delivery may take 30 or more. Who are we and why should you trust us?We are Pers®, a small company based in Lima, Peru and California U.S.A. Me, Ivi, Christoffer, Carlos Ernesto, and Juan Pablo on a sunny day in Lima. Eating ""Ají de Gallina"" with the Pers Team (Tienfeng, Ivi, Marujita, Harold, Ronald, Anthony, Christoffer, me).We create books, apps, toys and we recently launched a brand-new trading card game: Blobbiemundo™, which is currently played in Peru and we are hoping to take worldwide. More info on our TCG here and in our video below in Spanish (think of it as a foreign movie).

 
Now, about my background ... I have over 20 years of experience in Design and Development. My accomplishements include working as a Software Consultant at Cisco & Oracle ...Some of my work for Cisco and Oracle. ... becoming the Visual Manager of Adobe's Creative Suites, in charge of Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat and others (I redesigned Photoshop's toolbar, proposed Adobe Bridge, and defined the style for the first Creative Suites) ...Some of my work for Adobe. ... and being fired by Steve Jobs at Apple (well, he laid off half the company in a reorg, he didn't actually fire me personally ... but I still hold a grudge!). Below is a photo of me after having my dreams crushed by Steve.At Apple ... cleaning out my cubicle :'( If you are curious about my many, many failures (and some successes) in life, you can read all about them here.Anyway, my point is that my team and I have experience creating and delivering products, so we'll make good use of the funds gathered in this campaign and we'll deliver quality products on time.If you want to see some of our past work, you can download our FREE apps below.Ice Math Ninja (Winner of a ""Family Choice Award"" and reached #1 Family App in 16 countries):iOS: https://apple.co/33ulUAK   Android: http://bit.ly/2IPNb8J

Why do you need my hard-earned money?Because we are a small company and if want to eat (we do!) we must work on things that bring money quickly ... which means that fun projects like the Blobbies' app always take a back seat. I've been working on this app in my spare time since 2014, but I can never set aside enough time to complete it. Working on the Blobbies' app in ancient 2015. If this campaign is successful, we'll be able to hire additional personnel to help out with our workload so that we can finalize the graphics, animations, level creation, and the testing of the app (if you want to be an app tester, there is a funding level for that!).  Possible additions to the Blobbies' app that could happen ... if we exceeded our goal. Our funding goal is extremely modest, but we are hoping that you fall in love with the Blobbies, we exceed the goal and use the additional funds to be able to create a much better game ... and maybe even more Blobbie games and products ... it's all up to you (no pressure).  Concept game for smartwatches that could happen ... if this campaign was beyond successful. Thank you for reading, I hope we endeared ourselves to you ... or at least you pity us enough to pledge! Either way, the Blobbies love you and they eagerly await your support! :)",33.0,5,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","At Duettos
we manufacture classical tabletop games using your designs and your images
turning them into unique and beautiful artworks. We believe that playing games
with a personal touch is far more fun!
Duettos
games are not only fun to play but they are perfect and very personal gifts for birthdays,
weddings, Christmas and other occasions.
For us
quality, durability, design and a high service level are paramount.
Our vision is
to create a large portfolio of different games that customers can choose from
and can customize to their needs.
We
successfully started our business with a memory game. With this campaign on
Indiegogo we want to launch our customizable Domino game. If
successfully funded our third game will be a customizable Sudoku board game.

   
 Manufacturing
handmade games of high quality is time consuming and needs durable and appealing
materials. Next to optimizing the manufacturing process to keep production
costs low, we also need to purchase materials in advance and in larger batches.
Now this is where we ask for your support.




Seventy percent of our funding goal is allocated to purchase materials. Twenty percent will be invested in production tools and their development. The last ten percent
are reserve for unforeseeable issues.





Instead of dots on the tiles, our Domino shows your images! This makes playing Domino far more fun!


A normal double-six Domino game consists of 28 tiles having values from 0 till 6 points. Our Domino game consists of 36 tiles having values from 1 - 8 points, a different image reflecting each value. The tiles ar much larger than common Domino tiles. To manufacture your customized Domino you only need to send us 8 different images.

Every
project has risks and challenges but as we already managed to bring our first
game successfully to market, we have enough experience in making customizable
products.

We also
have very reliable suppliers for all our materials and have tested our new game
over a period of more than three months.
In
comparison to non-customizable products each Duettos game is made individually.
Depending on the amount of pre-orders, production and shipping might be a
challenge and could take longer as planned. We will however process all orders
first in first out.


If you like
our products and like what we do, then please help us to forward this campaign
to your friends! Mention our campaign on social media, like us on Facebook,
twitter about our project and post messages about us wherever you can!
If you have
any connection to the press, please contact us. We would be delighted if you
would write about us.
Thank you!

<p>The game idea is born somewhere during 2015, after watching the final scene from a Stephen King movie, ""The Shining"", where the main character, Jack, pursues the mother and her son accross a maze, in the snow. Contrary to what some people think, Spheres of Evil isn't based in any classic 80s, 90s game. At the beginning, it was going to be a much more minimalist game, with simple design and mechanics; it's only several months later that the idea of giving it a darker ambience came up, and with it, all the action-RPG elements, and the added complexity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://diegosendrasoftware.com/templates_email/html/table-less/responsive/Diego%20Sendra/Products/Spheres-of-Evil/Crowdfunding/images/header-3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>First of all, sorry if our English is not perfect, we do the best we can. Spanish is our native language. Spheres of Evil was going to be initially a game about demonology, in fact, that's why you see demonic symbology (seals) everywhere in the videos, so it was basically all about releasing demons across the mazes to receive powers. Then, we thought a more interesting twist. There's a saying that goes ""Don't deal with the Devil"", you surely know it. And that's precisely the story of our unnamed sphere-based character. Attracted by the dark side and occultism, and after disobeying the deals with the demons he worked with, the soul of our sorcerer is then locked inside a Crystal ball and condemned to roll eternally.</p>
<p>To make it worse, he was a powerful magician, so his activities opened the gates of an underworld and hundreds of demons passed through that portal, possessing the souls of men and women. In an act of repentance and in his desperate attempt to recover his human shape and be free and to save the world from this malice, our wizard-sphere has to release these souls by means of exorcisms, which wiill make him grow stronger in power, acquire new skills and get necessary tips to solve the puzzles that will be present in every level. Tips are reveled only when a soul is released from the torment.</p>
<p>But it won't be enough. His knowledge about magic and demons won't allow him to recover his human shape unless he picks the missing pages of a very ancient book. And there are many. The last page, the very last and most important page from the book is obtained in the last level only.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://diegosendrasoftware.com/templates_email/html/table-less/responsive/Diego%20Sendra/Products/Spheres-of-Evil/Crowdfunding/images/header-4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Release souls in order to receive great powers and important information/tips. Most levels will have one or more from a total of nearly a hundred you have to release.</p></li>
<li><p>You'll need to find the missing pages of a book, which will revert the spell the demons put on you. This is the first item in the Inventory, you will be able to see its contents as long as you start getting pages.</p></li>
<li><p>There are other objects that may be required as well to exit each level.</p></li>

<p>Apart from what has been said, Spheres of Evil is a very addictive game, with a high level of replayability, with several hours of granted gameplay. We can't say an specific number at this point, but there have been people playing it for hours in a row just to get past Level 4. The game was thought since its inception, as a very difficult game, with a special emphasis in a balanced level design. Our main objective was always that you wanted to return to it and continue from where you left, and that you always had fun and granted difficulty. Our focus was always aimed at the gameplay, it had to felt extremely good, it had to be smooth, with tight input/control response. Even since its prototype phase, in 2015, most of it it's there.</p>
<p>The extremely zoomed-in camera view makes you have not clear vision where you are nor where the next trap or enemy will appear, so you will need to somewhat memorize the paths in the mazes and the mazes themselves, and even by doing so, enemies will take you by surprise countless times (see gameplay footage/streams below). The Map object (it's in the Inventory), will be your best allied, but you have limited uses of it, so needs to be used at discretion.</p>
<p>There are some check points in each level (not yet implemented), which could ease things up a little. These saved-points are kept only as long as you are in the current level and will vanish when you try to play the same level again from the level selection screen, or the next time you continue the game. It's possible coming from a level ahead to one you played earlier, maybe to pick up some item of interest, to increase your available shootings, amongst other reasons. It's possible doing it. That's what we was talking about the replayability value. We don't want you pass the levels one after another just to get to the exit zones. We want you to explore every corner of the mazes. We like the completionist type of gamer. There will always be a hidden surprise. (i.e. secret rooms, interdimensional portals, etc.)</p>

<p>There are 3 worlds in Spheres of Evil, with 10 levels each, depicting different scenarios. First one has a more abstract aesthetic, with stones/walls of different, pale flat colours, asphalt-like floors, sand, grass, crumbling walls and wiring and other textures. The second world is more of a desert-like theme. There are also secret rooms, which in the first world refers to a sort of street drainage system. The ambience/scenary for the remaining 3rd. world is not yet defined. We would love you suggest your ideas on this regard, this campaign is also meant for this. See ""Community"" section below.</p>

<p>There are several items in the game, the Pentagram, the Chaos Symbol, the Clavicula Nox, the Leviathan Symbol, amongst others, each one with its colors and properties. Some objects won't do anything by itself, nor go to the inventory, but will give you a related object when a series of these items are picked up. i.e. You may receive a power-up or increase your available shootings percent, damage level or damage factor (in case you already have it), by picking 5 Green Leviathan objects. The amount of items to pick up, by its type is indicated at the beginning of the level.</p>
<p>There also exists the treasure chest, the map, the invisibility ball, the question mark, amongst others. It's important getting all the objects so to increase your powers, level up and acquire magic. You are going to fight against demons, so you will have to use their own elements and symbols in order to have a chance. You are a sorcerer after all.</p>

This doesn't apply to keys as they could be used multiple times in the same door of the same level. They don't have any sort of available uses limitation. There are 20 different types of keys. The first item refers to the Book, which will have the missing pages required to beat the game, reverting the conjuring. It has unlimited uses, you can see the book as many times as you want, you will see how the missing pages start appearing as long as you find them. If you know how to read Aramaic language it will have some interesting stuff to read, about magic. It could be an interesting research work by itself, trying to decipher the contents of this book.

<p>The book is a key element of the game, since it will allow you revert the conjuring that trapped you inside the sphere. To do so, you will need to find the missing pages. It's possible reading it, page by page through the inventory as explained above. It's written in Aramaic language, it contains drawing, symbols, reference tables, descriptions and diverse instructions for the exorcism to be made.

<p>There exists 4 Magics in the game, that can be accessed through the Inventory. Each one can only have certain amount of uses. Magic 1 produces less damage than 4th, and therefore, less than 2nd. and 3rd. You have to use them with care, they are of limited usage.

<p>Spheres of Evil is entirely developed in Visual Studio in C#, using Monogame framework as the graphic library. We didn't want to use Unity nor Unreal nor other game engines, but to develop our own engine. This wasn't a capricious decision, we already had a good amount of Classes and methods, code and propietary libraries that made the creation of the engine a little easier.  It's been in development for about 1 year, we started in June 2017, from a 2016 prototype.</p>

<p>There should be many technical aspects to discuss in this section, but it would be very boring. Some of them have been already discussed above, so generally speaking, we could mention:</p>

Scoring and world-level indicators are placed at the center and right-top screen areas, respectively.<p>We didn't want a heavy dashboard, that occupied much of the game area. So for the mobile version, when and if we do it, we thought of a very lightweight semi-transparent interface, regarding input/controls, placed at the bottom part.</p>

<p>Similar to the tutorial, text pop-up indications will be given when receiving certain items, or when touching/accessing certain objects. It's important you read it all.

<p>All levels are first designed in paper, then carefuly replicated using Tiled software and designed/textured by our graphic designer. Then, they are printed. The addition of objects/items, doors, switches, traps, enemy paths amongst other things, complete the level design process and it's entirely made in paper. Only when it's finished, it's passed back to the software using our own level editor, which exports all the level data as an encrypted text file.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.diegosendrasoftware.com/templates_email/html/table-less/responsive/Diego%20Sendra/Products/Spheres-of-Evil/Crowdfunding/images/20180720_023331.jpg"" src=""""/><p><i>*Level design draft, on paper</i></p>

Same applies for those that get the game directly from us, as a stand-alone version, which will have a FTP update module, indicating there's an available update and asking for confirmation to proceed to update.

<p>2D/2.5D, no-pixel art aesthetics. We wanted to give it, at the beginning, a much more minimalist appearence, but it became something much more realistic as time went by. We think it's looking better. The game already went through 3 complete graphic revamping, regarding maps, textures and floors. This 3rd. re-design process was a real major change. It included more textures, more realism, wall crumblings, textures over the walls and top part, improvements in the shadows, and countless other things. We don't discard other modifications in other aspects, if required.</p>

<p>During October and November and until reaching the PC/Windows Early Access version, we are working at:</p>
<ul>
<li>More/new traps (i.e. lava holes, nails)</li>
<li>More enemies</li>
<li>Improving player feedback during shooting/attacks</li>
<li>Menu system</li>
<li>Visual effects (rain, fog, lighting)</li>
<li>Levels 6 to 10 (4 and 5 are already completed), it will be total 30 levels in the game</li>
<li>Gamepad/DPad support</li>
<li>Intro/Final scenes &amp; level summary screens</li>
<li>Book browsing through the inventory</li>
<li>Optimization/Code refactoring</li>
<li>Others</li>
</ul>
<p>We always listen to the feedback of our players and testers, as long as it's constructive criticism. Something we are working on at this very moment refers to the improvement of player feedback, adding more into that matter, specially during combat/shooting situations. i.e. we will be adding more enemies from earlier levels, with little defenses so you can kill them more easily. At the same time, it will add some extra difficulty as they are enemies, just a new type. Also, the current 6 types of enemies are extremely tough to die, we will lower this down a bit. Right now, you can generally kill them if you are leveled-up, something like +4 or x2, which is not that easy to get at first levels. Besides this, more visual effects and yet more player feedback, more camera shaking, more tension overall basically, rewarding the player a little more. More suggestions? You are open to come up with some ideas. <strong>Be involved.</strong></p>

<p>We came up this long, after 2 years of development, with countless efforts and sacrifices, both personal and economic. I personally was making corporate-based Software and some Web design for businesses for about 2 decades, both as an employee and freelancing. Is not only until 2015 when I came up with the decision that I wanted to make a turn in the career and get back to videogames, something I was doing back in the 90s as a hobby, as a kid, which was always my passion. A change that has been insanely challenging, to say the least. First, because I had to continue working to be able to keep up with life and family expenses, making this game during nights/free time and weekends. Because I also had to also learn many new things. And because I had to invest own savings to outsource graphic design and other costs, for example two new machines.</p>
<p>Professionaly, I have over 2 decades in programming experience (I am not bragging about it, I am telling you where I come from). Personally, I am a dad of two wonderful kids, 2 and 4 years respectively, which they are adorable, but they also bring an insane amount of distraction, so I have to also take care of working when they were sleeping or not at home. This whole 2-year journey has been beyond stress to say the least (those who are dad can really know what I am talking about). I work from home, so as the previous designer and also Giordano, the guy I work with now. I lost count the last time I went to a doctor, for example. There are weeks I don't see the light of the sun. I suffer from anxiety attacks, so it's not easy. None of this project is easy, and the anxiety is just making it all worse some days/weeks.</p>
<p>A contract with the company I work for, for which I was hired to produce and maintain some corporate software, ended up my contract, so I have the need for this proyect to be economically successful, somewhat. I am not making Spheres of Evil to become rich, but to keep improving it, making new versions of it and to also continue making games and stablish ourselves as a small Game studio that is able to survive making games. To achieve this, we only need one thing: your help to help us complete this game in time, in little more than a month and a half. At least the Early Access version. I believe in this game, I believe in its potential. And so all the youtubers, streamers, and press that have been talking and believed always in it, through all these past months. But it's not enough, I need you believe in it as well.</p>
<p>Part of the fundings will be used to cover the rest of development costs as well as graphic design costs, to come up with the PC/Windows Early Access version in early November with 10 levels.</p>
<p>As a supporter, you will be able to come up with ideas to Spheres of Evil, new elements, and as far as possible and within the deadline we have, we could implement them and put your name in the credits. You can leave ideas in the Comments tab.</p>
<p>Reaching a minimum of $1500, PC/Windows Early Access version gets finished. By reaching $4000, the game goes from 10 levels to 30. It takes more than a month and a half, maybe 2, thinking/sketching them, both graphically and level-design wise, then integrating it into the game. That would be the 2nd. important goal to achieve.</p>

<p>The big challenge would be not reaching out the initial $1500. It sounds like little money, but to be honest, we have $0 in our pockets now. We have to work in many different things we don't like to keep putting food on the table, pay the rent, and be there for our family, basically by means of freelance work. That money we ask will allow us work entirely, everyday during October and half of November in the game to hit Early Access statuss in Steam and other stores. Not reaching this 1st. goal, just this 1st. one, will put the whole project at risk, possibly get it cancelled. We will do our best to try to continue no matter what, but it could be delayed several months more, it would maybe not have even the desired 30 levels and there won't be maybe nothing else than a PC/Windows version. It's hard to know at this point. We trust you will like the game, that you will fully support it and that the project will get fully funded, for all platforms and every stretch goal covered.</p>

*Level 2 - Exit zone
Spheres of Evil it's a tough top-down, action/RPG, puzzle, maze game. You'll have to release souls and destroy Demons from a huge dungeon, while trying to scape all kind of traps and obstacles in your way to the next level's exit zone. It will be also necessary getting the missing pages of an ancient book in order to revert a conjuring.Die over and over again in this game, all the way through 3 worlds and 30 different levels.
Download Spheres of Evil v0.7 (Demo) from Game Jolthttps://gamejolt.com/games/SpheresofEvil/315599*Extract ZIP file contents into a folder in your Desktop.

The game idea is born somewhere during 2015, after watching the final scene from a Stephen King movie, ""The Shining"", where the main character, Jack, pursues the mother and her son accross a maze, in the snow. Contrary to what some people think, Spheres of Evil isn't based in any classic 80s, 90s game. At the beginning, it was going to be a much more minimalist game, with simple design and mechanics; it's only several months later that the idea of giving it a darker ambience came up, and with it, all the action-RPG elements, and the added complexity.

First of all, sorry if our English is not perfect, we do the best we can. Spanish is our native language. Spheres of Evil was going to be initially a game about demonology, in fact, that's why you see demonic symbology (seals) everywhere in the videos, so it was basically all about releasing demons across the mazes to receive powers. Then, we thought a more interesting twist. There's a saying that goes ""Don't deal with the Devil"", you surely know it. And that's precisely the story of our unnamed sphere-based character. Attracted by the dark side and occultism, and after disobeying the deals with the demons he worked with, the soul of our sorcerer is then locked inside a Crystal ball and condemned to roll eternally.
To make it worse, he was a powerful magician, so his activities opened the gates of an underworld and hundreds of demons passed through that portal, possessing the souls of men and women. In an act of repentance and in his desperate attempt to recover his human shape and be free and to save the world from this malice, our wizard-sphere has to release these souls by means of exorcisms, which wiill make him grow stronger in power, acquire new skills and get necessary tips to solve the puzzles that will be present in every level. Tips are reveled only when a soul is released from the torment.
But it won't be enough. His knowledge about magic and demons won't allow him to recover his human shape unless he picks the missing pages of a very ancient book. And there are many. The last page, the very last and most important page from the book is obtained in the last level only.


Release souls in order to receive great powers and important information/tips. Most levels will have one or more from a total of nearly a hundred you have to release.
You'll need to find the missing pages of a book, which will revert the spell the demons put on you. This is the first item in the Inventory, you will be able to see its contents as long as you start getting pages.
There are other objects that may be required as well to exit each level.
Escaping each maze (there will be a total of 30 different levels).
It will be necessary to level-up your powers in order to be able to face the demons you'll find in the different stages in the game. They are tough bastards.


*Level 2 - Fire ball power-up
Apart from what has been said, Spheres of Evil is a very addictive game, with a high level of replayability, with several hours of granted gameplay. We can't say an specific number at this point, but there have been people playing it for hours in a row just to get past Level 4. The game was thought since its inception, as a very difficult game, with a special emphasis in a balanced level design. Our main objective was always that you wanted to return to it and continue from where you left, and that you always had fun and granted difficulty. Our focus was always aimed at the gameplay, it had to felt extremely good, it had to be smooth, with tight input/control response. Even since its prototype phase, in 2015, most of it it's there.
The extremely zoomed-in camera view makes you have not clear vision where you are nor where the next trap or enemy will appear, so you will need to somewhat memorize the paths in the mazes and the mazes themselves, and even by doing so, enemies will take you by surprise countless times (see gameplay footage/streams below). The Map object (it's in the Inventory), will be your best allied, but you have limited uses of it, so needs to be used at discretion.
There are some check points in each level (not yet implemented), which could ease things up a little. These saved-points are kept only as long as you are in the current level and will vanish when you try to play the same level again from the level selection screen, or the next time you continue the game. It's possible coming from a level ahead to one you played earlier, maybe to pick up some item of interest, to increase your available shootings, amongst other reasons. It's possible doing it. That's what we was talking about the replayability value. We don't want you pass the levels one after another just to get to the exit zones. We want you to explore every corner of the mazes. We like the completionist type of gamer. There will always be a hidden surprise. (i.e. secret rooms, interdimensional portals, etc.)

*Please note the framerate and the scroll in the game is far smoother than what you can see in these videos. It's an issue of the video-capturing software that have been used, it's capturing at 30fps instead of 60.

 

You will be able to select every resolution your graphic card is capable of, enable/disable VSync, windowed or border-less screen modes, setting the FPS Rate of your choice (60, 72, 75, 85 up to 144), and even typing your own FPS rate value. Game progress is saved as long as you play, it allows several game data files saved in the same device/machine, just as usual in every game. You will be able to choose latest saved game from the menu, chronologicaly, or choose any other saved game through Load Game option.

There are 3 worlds in Spheres of Evil, with 10 levels each, depicting different scenarios. First one has a more abstract aesthetic, with stones/walls of different, pale flat colours, asphalt-like floors, sand, grass, crumbling walls and wiring and other textures. The second world is more of a desert-like theme. There are also secret rooms, which in the first world refers to a sort of street drainage system. The ambience/scenary for the remaining 3rd. world is not yet defined. We would love you suggest your ideas on this regard, this campaign is also meant for this. See ""Community"" section below.

The enemies won't follow you, they go fixed paths, sometimes from origin to destination, back and forth, sometimes more of a closed circuit path. From Marquises and onwards, they have ability to shoot if you come across their line of fire. Enemies have energy bars and can be effectively be killed. Bear in mind they will revive everytime you die, when the level restarts or when you later revisit the level.
Not only the souls you release will give you powers, you will find power-ups in different spots in the dungeons, the Ice Ball, the Fire Ball, the Electric Ray, the Power of Wind and the Dagger. The powers we receive are the powers from the demons we exorcise. *Some magic symbols/sealsThese Seals are important as reference spots in the maps, there will be over a hundred different symbols. Sometimes, by reaching certain places or getting close to some objects, it will be indicated getting close to certain symbol, as a tip of something important that needs to be picked up or some sort of geographical orientation. So it's important you memorize these symbols position, and somewhat, their names or you will be going around in circles. You have to step over them for a pop-up text to be displayed, which will reveal the name, type and properties of the symbol. Some of them will also allow you get through interdimensional portals, allowing you to teleport to other zones in the map. Some zones will be completely inaccessible and this is the only way to get access to them.

*Some items
There are several items in the game, the Pentagram, the Chaos Symbol, the Clavicula Nox, the Leviathan Symbol, amongst others, each one with its colors and properties. Some objects won't do anything by itself, nor go to the inventory, but will give you a related object when a series of these items are picked up. i.e. You may receive a power-up or increase your available shootings percent, damage level or damage factor (in case you already have it), by picking 5 Green Leviathan objects. The amount of items to pick up, by its type is indicated at the beginning of the level.
There also exists the treasure chest, the map, the invisibility ball, the question mark, amongst others. It's important getting all the objects so to increase your powers, level up and acquire magic. You are going to fight against demons, so you will have to use their own elements and symbols in order to have a chance. You are a sorcerer after all.

*Inventory systemNot all the items collected go into the inventory, so to not flood it and making it hard to explore. So, everytime the same object is picked up, the amount of available uses is displayed in the top-left corner of the item, instead of being added twice. This doesn't apply to keys as they could be used multiple times in the same door of the same level. They don't have any sort of available uses limitation. There are 20 different types of keys. The first item refers to the Book, which will have the missing pages required to beat the game, reverting the conjuring. It has unlimited uses, you can see the book as many times as you want, you will see how the missing pages start appearing as long as you find them. If you know how to read Aramaic language it will have some interesting stuff to read, about magic. It could be an interesting research work by itself, trying to decipher the contents of this book. In fact we added ""The Book"" item as the highest reward, the last one of the Perks/Tiers, the Sorcerer Perk.


The book is a key element of the game, since it will allow you revert the conjuring that trapped you inside the sphere. To do so, you will need to find the missing pages. It's possible reading it, page by page through the inventory as explained above. It's written in Aramaic language, it contains drawing, symbols, reference tables, descriptions and diverse instructions for the exorcism to be made. The page number will be mentioned everytime you pick up a page so you can go check the Inventory and read it.
The book is a compilation of texts and fragments from an anonymous Grimoire from XVII Century. Which at the same time, is based in really ancient scriptures from XIV or XV centuries, supposedly attributed to a Monk, according to the legend.
*The Book - Graphics *We are working in the texts, diagrams, charts, illustrations and contents of the book at this moment.
When reaching the last level from the last World, it might be necessary revisiting earlier worlds/levels in case of having missing pages.

There exists 4 Magics in the game, that can be accessed through the Inventory. Each one can only have certain amount of uses. Magic 1 produces less damage than 4th, and therefore, less than 2nd. and 3rd. You have to use them with care, they are of limited usage. Ideally, you have to use them when the place is crowded by enemies, for example in Level 5.


The dashboard will be always visible, as soon as you obtain the first power-up. As you can see in the above picture, the dashboard shows the selected power-up, the available shootings percent, the damage level (+2 a +6), the damage factor (x2 a x6), amount of picked-up keys for the current level and the amount of pages you've picked up so far. Alt Key or Button Y in the Gamepad, will allow you alternate powers. We are working right now in an additional row in the dashboard that could display the other items (those referred above) and its quantities.

You will find many doors in the game, that will require a specific switch so to be opened. The grey doors can't be initially opened, contrary to blue and green doors. There are doors of other colors as well. A green switch doesn't mean that will open all the green doors in a level, but one. Oftenly, the door that gets opened by activating a switch, it's far from the switch. You will listen the sound of a heavy door that slides in the floor, as an indication.

 
Only blades have been implemented as a trap, so far, but there will be more, such as the lava holes and the nails. The blades open and close at different time intervals, so you will have to learn the specific timings of each one. These have been a serious problem for everyone that played this game. :)
 *Level 3 -Secret room 1The secret rooms are small areas you can access from different, hidden points in the maps. Did we really say hidden? Full of traps and enemies, they contain great rewards and items.
We are working in some special effects as well, as the fog, lightnings, rain, camera shake at certain events such as dying, amongst others. So when using magics, for example a rain of balls in fire, in case of using the Hathopnasael Magic, an avalanch of rocks in case of Msarahiel Magic, and others.

Spheres of Evil is entirely developed in Visual Studio in C#, using Monogame framework as the graphic library. We didn't want to use Unity nor Unreal nor other game engines, but to develop our own engine. This wasn't a capricious decision, we already had a good amount of Classes and methods, code and propietary libraries that made the creation of the engine a little easier.  It's been in development for about 1 year, we started in June 2017, from a 2016 prototype.

There should be many technical aspects to discuss in this section, but it would be very boring. Some of them have been already discussed above, so generally speaking, we could mention:
We wanted a minimal UI, with a small, transparent dashboard in the top-left. Scoring and world-level indicators are placed at the center and right-top screen areas, respectively.We didn't want a heavy dashboard, that occupied much of the game area. So for the mobile version, when and if we do it, we thought of a very lightweight semi-transparent interface, regarding input/controls, placed at the bottom part.

The in-game tutorial will give you some tips as text pop-ups, sometimes placed over the player some other times centered in the screen as far as you reach certain progress in the maps.

Similar to the tutorial, text pop-up indications will be given when receiving certain items, or when touching/accessing certain objects. It's important you read it all. The text is shown by means of standing over an object or in proximity to it, and it dissapears as long as you step out. You can advance every page in the text with the Space Bar/Enter or Button A in the Gamepad.

All levels are first designed in paper, then carefuly replicated using Tiled software and designed/textured by our graphic designer. Then, they are printed. The addition of objects/items, doors, switches, traps, enemy paths amongst other things, complete the level design process and it's entirely made in paper. Only when it's finished, it's passed back to the software using our own level editor, which exports all the level data as an encrypted text file. *Level design draft, on paper

Updates in the game are free, we are never going to charge an update nor a DLC. Updates are managed by the stores themselves, Steam, Gamejolt, itch.io, Windows Store, through their own client software. Same applies for those that get the game directly from us, as a stand-alone version, which will have a FTP update module, indicating there's an available update and asking for confirmation to proceed to update. In any case, there's no chance of loosing game progress, inventory items, power-ups, score, nor current world/level position.

2D/2.5D, no-pixel art aesthetics. We wanted to give it, at the beginning, a much more minimalist appearence, but it became something much more realistic as time went by. We think it's looking better. The game already went through 3 complete graphic revamping, regarding maps, textures and floors. This 3rd. re-design process was a real major change. It included more textures, more realism, wall crumblings, textures over the walls and top part, improvements in the shadows, and countless other things. We don't discard other modifications in other aspects, if required.

Here's a glympse of how the new map is looking like for World 2. We are still working on it, this is not by any means anything final.

*World 2 - Graphics *this is a work in progress (WIP), it's lacking textures and more design.


*Spheres of Evil v0.5 - Secret Room skinning / Teleporting / Debug - Dev. Stream/Coding**Graphic shown here refer to previous v0.5 and older versions

The music goes along the lines of dark classical orchestral music, darkwave, ambient genres. It's composed by Ioann Udartsev, an excellent musician from Russia, with whom we will have a license agreement to use his music in the game, in case the game gets to be released. You can refer to his work here  https://soundcloud.com/ioann-udartsev - Ioann it's a great composer, a great guy and his music fits incredibly well the dark aesthetic of the game, even when it wasn't specifically designed for it.Regarding sounds, we work mainly with free resources.As said before, Spheres of Evil OST, averages 1 hour duration, being a compilation of Ioann's music. We will be probably uploading Spheres of Evil OST to youtube once the game is finished.

We've been working with several beta testers and collaborators along all of this time, and their help have been invaluable to fix bugs on time. Also youtubers and streamers, they've all put their 50 cents in order to report bugs and feedback to improve Spheres of Evil. If you want to help beta test the game in this final stage, you are more than welcomed to do it. You can download a demo of the game as detailed in the Download section, way down below and get in touch with us. We will need you make use of any video capturing software of your choice, so you can make footage of your gameplay so you can send it to us, detailing the exact minute/second where you found a bug.

During October and November and until reaching the PC/Windows Early Access version, we are working at:

More/new traps (i.e. lava holes, nails)
More enemies
Improving player feedback during shooting/attacks
Menu system
Visual effects (rain, fog, lighting)
Levels 6 to 10 (4 and 5 are already completed), it will be total 30 levels in the game
Gamepad/DPad support
Intro/Final scenes & level summary screens
Book browsing through the inventory
Optimization/Code refactoring
Others

We always listen to the feedback of our players and testers, as long as it's constructive criticism. Something we are working on at this very moment refers to the improvement of player feedback, adding more into that matter, specially during combat/shooting situations. i.e. we will be adding more enemies from earlier levels, with little defenses so you can kill them more easily. At the same time, it will add some extra difficulty as they are enemies, just a new type. Also, the current 6 types of enemies are extremely tough to die, we will lower this down a bit. Right now, you can generally kill them if you are leveled-up, something like +4 or x2, which is not that easy to get at first levels. Besides this, more visual effects and yet more player feedback, more camera shaking, more tension overall basically, rewarding the player a little more. More suggestions? You are open to come up with some ideas. Be involved.

The game will be available for PC/Windows in October/November 2018 on Steam, Gamejolt, itch.io and other stores and soon after that, for Windows 10 and Xbox One (UWP version).
Depending on the success of the campaign, it will be ported for Nintendo Switch as well, hopefuly. Following that, Android and iOs versions are also planned.

We came up this long, after 2 years of development, with countless efforts and sacrifices, both personal and economic. I personally was making corporate-based Software and some Web design for businesses for about 2 decades, both as an employee and freelancing. Is not only until 2015 when I came up with the decision that I wanted to make a turn in the career and get back to videogames, something I was doing back in the 90s as a hobby, as a kid, which was always my passion. A change that has been insanely challenging, to say the least. First, because I had to continue working to be able to keep up with life and family expenses, making this game during nights/free time and weekends. Because I also had to also learn many new things. And because I had to invest own savings to outsource graphic design and other costs, for example two new machines.
Professionaly, I have over 2 decades in programming experience (I am not bragging about it, I am telling you where I come from). Personally, I am a dad of two wonderful kids, 2 and 4 years respectively, which they are adorable, but they also bring an insane amount of distraction, so I have to also take care of working when they were sleeping or not at home. This whole 2-year journey has been beyond stress to say the least (those who are dad can really know what I am talking about). I work from home, so as the previous designer and also Giordano, the guy I work with now. I lost count the last time I went to a doctor, for example. There are weeks I don't see the light of the sun. I suffer from anxiety attacks, so it's not easy. None of this project is easy, and the anxiety is just making it all worse some days/weeks.
A contract with the company I work for, for which I was hired to produce and maintain some corporate software, ended up my contract, so I have the need for this proyect to be economically successful, somewhat. I am not making Spheres of Evil to become rich, but to keep improving it, making new versions of it and to also continue making games and stablish ourselves as a small Game studio that is able to survive making games. To achieve this, we only need one thing: your help to help us complete this game in time, in little more than a month and a half. At least the Early Access version. I believe in this game, I believe in its potential. And so all the youtubers, streamers, and press that have been talking and believed always in it, through all these past months. But it's not enough, I need you believe in it as well.
Part of the fundings will be used to cover the rest of development costs as well as graphic design costs, to come up with the PC/Windows Early Access version in early November with 10 levels.
As a supporter, you will be able to come up with ideas to Spheres of Evil, new elements, and as far as possible and within the deadline we have, we could implement them and put your name in the credits. You can leave ideas in the Comments tab.
Reaching a minimum of $1500, PC/Windows Early Access version gets finished. By reaching $4000, the game goes from 10 levels to 30. It takes more than a month and a half, maybe 2, thinking/sketching them, both graphically and level-design wise, then integrating it into the game. That would be the 2nd. important goal to achieve.



2016 (half)
Prototype
2017
June, starts PC/Windows version development
2018

October 1st.: Starts the crowdfunding campaign
October/November: PC/Windows Early Access version. Will be uploaded to Steam, Gamejolt, itch.io.
December: World 2 - 10 levels

2019

January: World 3: 10 levels
February/March: Windows 10/Xbox One version, uploaded to Windows Store

We would be doing the versions/ports for Nintendo Switch, Android and iOS after March in 2019, in case the campaign is succesful and the 4th Stretch Goal is reached. It's necessary buying the Nintendo Switch development kit and an iPad for this. These costs are already foreseen from $12500 onwards, as detailed in the Stretch Goals table, above.

It will be available in:Hopefuly in:

The big challenge would be not reaching out the initial $1500. It sounds like little money, but to be honest, we have $0 in our pockets now. We have to work in many different things we don't like to keep putting food on the table, pay the rent, and be there for our family, basically by means of freelance work. That money we ask will allow us work entirely, everyday during October and half of November in the game to hit Early Access statuss in Steam and other stores. Not reaching this 1st. goal, just this 1st. one, will put the whole project at risk, possibly get it cancelled. We will do our best to try to continue no matter what, but it could be delayed several months more, it would maybe not have even the desired 30 levels and there won't be maybe nothing else than a PC/Windows version. It's hard to know at this point. We trust you will like the game, that you will fully support it and that the project will get fully funded, for all platforms and every stretch goal covered.

<h3>Get your backpack ready!         </h3>
<p>        After your busy and boring daily life, you finally decided to go on a vacation. This time, you've decided to go on a very long journey to the Hejau Archipelago, a beautiful place with a thousand stories.</p>
<p>        In this game, the player will travel from one island to another, to be able to move to the next island, the player needs to complete the main quest on the current island the player is currently on. The main quests will appear one after another. however, there will be some side quests that the player will discover if they interact with NPCs and/or objects in the game. Besides the quests, there are tons of extra hidden objects scattered around the game world, some quests point the player to some of them, the rest can be found in another way, either directly or through some event or clue.</p>

<h3>Hidden objects</h3>
<p>There are two types of hidden objects in this game, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Quest objects</strong>. These are the objects that you need to find to complete certain quest.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Extra objects</strong>. These objects are listed on the player's in-game journal, i name the section as ""findings"". there are three categories of ""finding"" that the player can find in the game, they are common findings, rare findings and special findings. Each category named base on their difficulties to find.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To sum it up...</h3>
<p>The <u>main objective</u> of this game is to complete all the quests and find all the hidden objects including  the extra objects listed on the in-game journal (in the 'findings' section). It sounds easy, but I'll make sure it's not that easy to find ALL of those objects...</p>
<p><strong>Currently, the game is optimized for PC, optimization for another platform may follow, Nintendo Switch is on the consideration.</strong></p>

<h3>Entertaining, informing, educating</h3>
<p>It's not that easy to find a game that contains all that aspect above, and that is the purpose of this game. I do and i will do add more and more positive content into the game in terms of education and information aspect, all while making sure it still enjoyable.</p>
<p>For some examples, there is a quest to help a farmer cultivate some kind of tree he used to chop down for his needs. or some hidden objects that contain a piece of information about some kind of endangered animal species. Another quest warns the player to be aware of wild mushroom species, as some of them are poisonous while some are edible and tasty!</p>
<p>The player will also see some kind acts in the game. Let's make sure this game is safe for the kids!</p>

<h3><strong>The Allocation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>If i reach my first goal I'm going to hire some talents</strong> to help me speed up the development time and to extend the subscription of my main softwares which are Autodesk 3ds max and Adobe CC. My 3ds max sub will expire in about two months.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Main softwares : </b>  <strong>$ 2.115</strong>, that is $ 1.545/yr for 3ds max and $570/yr for adobe CC apps</li>
<li>
<strong>Programmer : $ 1.400, est.</strong> I have met a programmer that i need to hire, this amount is for his salary for some fixed development point or duration. </li>
<li>
<strong>2d and/or 3d artist: $ 1.200</strong>, i'm able to do both myself, but i need to hire talents for speeding up the process. This is for 1 month only, will extend if another goal reached.</li>
<li>
<strong>Another $785</strong> is for sound assets and maybe some 3d assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the budget i requested is not big, it's because i'm making sure everything is realistic, well-planned and more than just an imagination. I have planned a stretched goal tho...</p>

<p><i>Crisis Crunch</i> is a cartoon style adventure where a bunch of workers are trying to sabotage their company, an underworld enterprise of evil. They have been cheated to sign a contract (that they didn’t even read) for a job in hell, losing their souls in the process. They can´t go back to the mortal realm if they don’t destroy their contracts, so together, they plan to bring down the corporation to reach its president: Lucas Feri, the current owner of their souls.</p>
<p><i>Crisis Crunch</i> is an “in-formal complaint” about mass media,  crisis,  labor situation and  general stupidity of modern society, all combined with high doses of freak culture and audiovisual references.</p>
<p><i>Crisis Crunch</i> forgets about inventory items and such mechanics, and gives you the opportunity to use the “powers” (let´s better say “inappropriate abilities”) of eight different characters such as: hiper-swiping, accountant analyzing, flashing dentition, super caffeine speed, “fetchbook” profiling and others.</p>

<p>This gang of losers and office fools, is our gang of
losers. They are as fucked up by the system as we all were some time in our
lives. They are a caricature, a cliché with a turn of the screw.</p>
<p>In <i>Crisis Crunch</i>
we have a main character, Guy
 Guatamez, the eternal intern. To
ruin the corporation he will assemble a powerful crew made by: an offhand slang
secretary, a cheeky blind administrative with his infernal guide dog, a Colombian
ex-revolutionary maid, a handsome marketing guy with a shining dentition, a Zen
hag known as the guru psychologist of human resources, a bizarre freaky IT guy
and a Chinese accountant who secretly dreams about conquering the world. All of
them receive the guiding and counselling of a demoniac beverages machine in
their crusade for freedom.</p>

<br/>
<p>Imagine using an extra crunchy bag of crisps to
demolish walls, solve puzzles by swiping the floor, use the powerful ears of a
blind person to gossip around, intoxicate people with a cheap perfume, use your
accountant vision to see unnoticed details, and other even more in-congruent
abilities.</p>
<p>Characters will unlock their powers while the story unfolds
and you have to decide how those powers could be used to solve the different
puzzles and bizarre situations you will encounter. Why collecting stuff around
if your characters have all they need?</p>

<br/>
<p>Companions can also participate in the conversations
of the main character with the different NPC, if you have the right companion
with you when you are in a dialog he or she can intervene (by quickly clicking in
the exclamation above his or her head) and the talking will have different
conclusion.</p>

<p>They are evil, soooo evil! They invented <i>selfies</i>. They are responsible for all that is wrong in the world (of course, it is not human race´s fault!). </p>
<p>Malebolge Corp. is divided in eight Departments of Sin,
leaded by their Departament Chiefs: from a lustful rapper, to a greedy banker,
from a narcissistic bishop to an evil genius child who creates social
platforms, from politicians to military tyrants. The cream of society is in
charge of this horrible, horrible place.</p>
<p>This place is full of demons, creatures and zombies
who work in their offices, only a 2% of the staff are humans (only because they
deduct). Those humans are desperate people that are convinced to sign a
contract for an eternal job by losing their souls in the process. Even when
they die they will still work in the corporation as zombies.</p>
<p>That’s why our bunch is trying to get out of here and
only you can help them.</p>

<p>We thought we have invented the term, but an internet search
showed us we were wrong. Yes, electro-oldie is an existing term and yes, we
want to use this word to define our core music.</p>
<p>This music is electronic music with the flavour of old
TV series intros and retro games tonalities with a bit of surrealism.</p>
<p>Our musicians, Antonio
Peña and Julián Rodriguez,
great composers and music teachers, that have created OST´s for different films,
had found a perfect breakeven between the retro junk and the electronics. </p>
<p>This is our main theme, which is always more dynamic
than the other in game tracks, but all the OST in general is full of sutile stridencies
combining electronic harmonies and retrogaming themes.</p>

<p>Why shout when you can laugh? Uncensored talk is
great, but uncensored laughs are better.</p>
<p>Let´s laugh about us, about social nonsense, about
people in media, about politics, about any other human aspect. We (<i>Crisis Crunch</i> Team) are masochists, we
like our characters to rant about us as well (they will do it several times
trough the game, you will see), but we are afraid to tell you they will not
stop there, we created a monster! (A bunch of them, in fact) they are no longer
under our control they are thinking by themselves. But we all are thinking
about ourselves ultimately, in this times we are living we must not stop having
critical thinking, but we can have it with a smile.</p>
<p>That’s what <i>Crisis
Crunch</i> wanted; it addresses social problems and then explodes in laughter. <i>Crisis Crunch</i> is meant to be an exhaust
valve for daily frustration, and of course an evasion and a great gaming
experience.</p>

<p><b>Our
Main Goal in this campaign is get the PART 1 of the game funded. That includes:
 the Prologue and Chapter 1 of the game.</b></p>
<p>The production will last about 5-7 months
and we will release a free playable demo before PART 1 is finished. The game
will be in Spanish and English languages.</p>
<p>The idea is to make a crowdfunding campaign
for each of the three parts of the game, in total: a prologue and five chapters.</p>
<p>But all depends on our backers. If we have good support in this current campaign maybe we could obtain enough funds to
complete also PART 2 and even PART 3 if we are lucky.</p>
<p><b>You can see in our Funding Barometer</b>, in
the section below, what quantities we need for funding each part of the
game.</p>
<p>If we reach our main goal and we receive more funds than expected but they are not sufficient to achieve the extra
goal of a new chapter, we will save this money for the production of that
chapter anyway, and when we make the crowdfunding campaign for that part we
will subtract that extra money you gave us in the previous campaign from the
funding goal we establish for the next campaign.  </p>
<p>Even if we reach our goal, our Indiegogo
profile will be active and you will be able to support us during the production of
the parts achieved. Who knows!  Maybe,
while we are working on it, you make possible that another part of the game could
be developed as well.</p>
<p>This campaign profile will be closed before
the last funded part is released. And we will open a new campaign to fund the parts
which remains undone, if there are any left.</p>
<p>Also, the benefits we obtain for the sales
of the firsts parts will be used for the next part and production until the
complete game is finished.</p>

<p><b>Freedom. </b></p>
<p>Indiegogo treat you like an adult who knows what he
wants, who can make his own decisions about what sell and how to introduce it
to the public. And what is important, Indiegogo let the backers decide if a
project it´s worthy of their interest, applying less project pre-selection or
interfering in the team´s way of doing his will based in their best judgment.</p>
<p>That is why we chose Indiegogo for both our current
projects.</p>
<p>Indiegogo works in the same ideological wavelength we
do. Creators must be free to introduce their work at their own way and backers
and players must be free to support or play the project that means something to
them.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Because
videogames are art, and art is abstraction, is relative. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Because
videogames are experiences and experiences are something intimate and personal.</p>
<p>Standards could be something useful, but why not
convert freedom of expression in a standard?</p>
<p><b>Funding</b></p>
<p>Finally, we decide to start a crowdfunding profile in
order to fund this great idea, with this money we can access to the resources
we need, and invest more personal time in the project. </p>
<p>Your support is essential for us; we want you to feel
free to ask anything, that’s why we pretend to have a well attended social
community. You are OUR backers!</p>

<p>We are not trying to create a community bigger than we
can manage, always quality before quantity or size. To ensure that, we have
Community Managing personnel and a team that dangerously enjoys sharing things
and gossiping about the project.</p>
<p>Working in this kind of projects is a great
experience but, of course, sometimes could be stressful and exhausting.
Receiving your cheers, your commentaries or simply your hellos will make us remember
why we are doing this, besides, we have a lot to do and a lot to learn and you
have a lot to teach us, so we want to be sure you have the correct channels to
do so. </p>
<p>A community is very useful. In a community there are
always Trimmers (as we call them) people who share their knowledge and give you
a lot of advices and suggestions and also, there are Tanglers, people who gives
you hope and diffuses the news, people that connect us to others, making <i>Crisis Crunch</i> emerge from the shadows
and step up into the digital world.</p>
<p>And of course this and the other spectrums of the
cyber-life conforms The Players, people who love gaming, or maybe potential
players waiting for the perfect occasion to be initiated in the interactive
world, we work for you so…</p>
<p>Trimmers, Tanglers, Players…</p>

<p>In this and other campaigns that we could make in order to fund and release all the parts of the game, we will see who were the backers that have been supported us most in all this process (even more than one time) and they will have these rewards. So they won´t be effective until the end of THE COMPLETE GAME production. </p>
<p>Also, some of this rewards are interactive extras for all the players so, obviously, they will be integrated in the final version of the game not in the early released parts.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Trim Tangle is a nexus of entrepreneurs and creative people who loves
interactive entertainment, games and digital arts. There are several members in
this collective and plenty of ideas and creative proposals arise from its
people.</p>
<p>Actually the core is divided in
two different teams working in two simultaneous videogame projects (Crisis Crunch is one of these games), supporting
each other when is needed. In this web site you can see our profiles. Besides
the teams, there are other nexus members and contacts working in their own
board games or pen and paper role play games or digital and artistic projects.</p>
<p>We consider games a tool to transmit and
express, a tool to connect to others, for us is the perfect channel to send a
message, to generate an experience and, of course, a great way of entertainment.
Videogames nurture from literature, cinema, arts, music and science to create
something unique.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in this times we are
facing, videogames (and other digital arts) must evolve, not being just a way
of evasion but a way to learn, to understand the human world. Videogames must
not been reclusive but connective.</p>
<p>Adults have been cheated to avoid games,
except those considered appropriate for their ages. With this we made a
terrible mistake, this generation is starting to realize it.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t apply to us, we believe
in games as we believe in any kind of artistic expression, and we see both as
what they are, a way of innovation, vindication and communication, part of the
tangle that weave us together, because we are <i>Trim Tangle</i>.</p>

<p>Corzón give his back to a finished Laws Degree and
then studied DGAC (Digital Graphic and Artistic Creation) learning about
traditional and new techniques of illustration, design and animation. Not
having enough, his delirium led him to other weird careers as Narrative
Creation, Interactive Writing and Game Designing, his ultimate passion. Heavens
knows how, he has published tales, articles and essays and has earned some
prizes and nominations in poetry comic and writing minor competitions.</p>
<p>Simultaneously to the both videogame projects (<i>Crisis Crunch</i> and <i>Therefore</i>), he is working in a Pen and Paper project, promoting a
social collective and practicing as a mediator.</p>
<p> Corzón loves
games and videogames over all, in fact we think he lives in a perpetual
videogame (¿Isla Piñata, maybe?), he uses literature, philosophy, art, comic, Theater and the entire audiovisual spectrum to shape his interactive and
philosophical nonsense, and sometimes, just sometimes, some of them worked.</p>

<p>The beauty of her drawings has an easy explanation,
her hands only canalizes the beauty of her heart. Melvira believes in what
remains beyond the false glitter coverage of the mass media, in the charm of
the easy and caring things. </p>
<p>Sometime she uses art and eroticism as a way for
people to claim the beauty of all human bodies. As she says: “everyone is
beautiful in its own way”. But sorry folks! Not this time, this time she will
use her art skills to help us create some laughs, a great way as any other to reclaim
the best of us and accept the worst.</p>
<p>She is a great illustrator and concept artist and she studied
Artistic Designing and Illustration and has worked as a concept-artist,
character and GUI designer in recently launched videogame projects as <i>Grumpy Reaper</i> form <i>Drakhar Studios</i> o <i>Kambu Mistery
island</i>. Simultaneously to <i>Crisis

<p>Working alongside her is like enter in a Zen garden,
sometimes she felt a little disheartened by the worst part of the world we live

<p>Julián knows classical
harmonies and experimental ones combined could lead you to something never
achieved before. He has expertise on that.</p>
<p>You could see him
magical appearing in any project where musical innovation is the main theme.
And if this doesn´t satisfy his artistically hunger he will try to innovate and
collaborate with any audiovisual and cultural show. </p>
<p>He made the Original Soundtrack
of a lot of movies as: “The enchanted Forest”,
""<span>De</span>Profundis"", “Guts” and many
others including animation and independent films (in some of them he teamed up
with his actual creative companion Antonio Peña) and even made compositions for live theatre.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He graduated in
Composition and Orchestration, Piano and Musical Language and is president of “<i>Colorsonoro</i>”, a Spanish association for electronic
music development and video art. He also teaches in the conservatory.</p>
<p>Nobody trust more than
Julián in the capacity of music to give, and even to guide, guide us into our feelings,
guide us into a story, guide into to the future; for him composition and
innovation must walk side by side.</p>

<p>Anything could lead to

realized long time ago. From modern music to the classics, from electro-acoustic
to unplugged, he walk trough all the musical spectrum never making stops.</p>
<p>He is
composer, guitarist, pianist an jazz musician, and has created a Big Band and
played with famous singers as Maite Da Costa,
Julie Guravich, Cristal Méndez Queizán and
others.</p>
<p>He made the OST of both
commercial and independent films as: ""Dreams of a Summer Night”, “The
Apostle” “Wrap up” and many others (some of them in company of his associate Julián Rodriguez).
He also composes for experimental music labs and events while teaching in the
conservatory.</p>
<p>He is as versatile as sound
itself and never loses the chance to show how music could flow through the gaps
in the wall of our collective clichés and start to erode it. We believe that is
what he saw in our Project: a chance to contribute in the creation of a good
laugh-sledgehammer to make social <i>status quo</i>
tremor a little without forgetting to have a good time.</p>
<p>Antonio, as well as his
partner Julián, are both “beyond-goers” as we call them, and they have a outlandish,
funny and professional repertory ready to crash any self-arrogance <i>Crisis Crunch</i> could have.</p>

<p>
Librarian during the day, Community Manager by night. Worlds of information and
social networking have no secrets for her. Her vocation is to set up
relations, to discover new pathways, to develop alliances. </p>
<p>Maria studied Library
Science and she worked at the documentation centers of some law
firms and public libraries. Discovering, afterwards, an
unambiguous relation between her past and her future, she decided to study for Community
Manager. Ever since, she didn't stop exploring and (why deny it?) playing with
2.0 web possibilities. </p>
<p>Currently she collaborates with a librarian web
portal, coordinating sections and writing some posts about social media,
books and libraries. She is also making her first steps in illustration, more
specifically in the dark world of librarian fanzines. </p>
<p>Always restless, her hobbies are related with art,
design and creation, going from digital to traditional (such as crochet or
decorated cookies). Undoubtedly, this was the key to create such affinity with
the rest of the Nexus (especially for the cookies). </p>
<p>Her motto is that everything must be perfectly
written, connected, organized and classified, professional bias in its entire splendor.
She will be in charge of dealing with hungry trolls in the virtual
world and helping any curious people that approaches to our project.</p>

<p>Things must change, we all know that. Sometimes addressing  problems with a caustic smile is a powerful tool. We think videogames must
transmit, must be involved in human issues and that includes the social taboos:
politics, religion and mass media. Games are not just entertainment they can
serve for multiples human purposes as, for example, a vindicating tool.</p>
<p>In all our games we want to send a message to  society,
to people, because, without that, you can have a game, yeah maybe, but you
don´t have a game experience. And experiences are what shape us.</p>

<p>1. At the same time we are working in this project we
are trying to survive XD, we have to earn money somehow so most of us have to
spend hours in mid-time jobs and private design requests, funding would help us
to dedicate to our project the time it deserves. Nobody wants a member of team
leaving because he cannot afford to spend his time in the project. That would
be sad because we all know this is what we really want to do, so it wouldn't be
easy for this person to leave.</p>
<p>2. We have to accept it, production peaks happens, but
we are a very stubborn team, in fact all <i>Trim
Tangle</i> Nexus is made of stubborn people (sorry pals, it´s true), we don’t
give up so easily. Production issues have appeared and will appear but we
handled them before and will handle them in the future. Of course, there are
always be less delays if people could focus all their attention to the project
and invest most of their time in its conclusion, again, funding will help us a
lot with this fact.</p>
<p>3. Our greatest nightmare is not to be in touch with
you people! Videogame production could be a very “absorbent” job. But we cannot
allow ourselves to be out of your reach, we have an excellent community manager
and other outer allies who will help us to be constantly updating and sending
you news about the project.</p>
<p> We begged them

work, to make a window to personally update some inside info and personally

_________________________________________________________________________







Crisis Crunch is a cartoon style adventure where a bunch of workers are trying to sabotage their company, an underworld enterprise of evil. They have been cheated to sign a contract (that they didn’t even read) for a job in hell, losing their souls in the process. They can´t go back to the mortal realm if they don’t destroy their contracts, so together, they plan to bring down the corporation to reach its president: Lucas Feri, the current owner of their souls.
Crisis Crunch is an “in-formal complaint” about mass media,  crisis,  labor situation and  general stupidity of modern society, all combined with high doses of freak culture and audiovisual references.
Crisis Crunch forgets about inventory items and such mechanics, and gives you the opportunity to use the “powers” (let´s better say “inappropriate abilities”) of eight different characters such as: hiper-swiping, accountant analyzing, flashing dentition, super caffeine speed, “fetchbook” profiling and others.












This gang of losers and office fools, is our gang of
losers. They are as fucked up by the system as we all were some time in our
lives. They are a caricature, a cliché with a turn of the screw.
In Crisis Crunch
we have a main character, Guy
 Guatamez, the eternal intern. To
ruin the corporation he will assemble a powerful crew made by: an offhand slang
secretary, a cheeky blind administrative with his infernal guide dog, a Colombian
ex-revolutionary maid, a handsome marketing guy with a shining dentition, a Zen
hag known as the guru psychologist of human resources, a bizarre freaky IT guy
and a Chinese accountant who secretly dreams about conquering the world. All of
them receive the guiding and counselling of a demoniac beverages machine in
their crusade for freedom.


       

Imagine using an extra crunchy bag of crisps to
demolish walls, solve puzzles by swiping the floor, use the powerful ears of a
blind person to gossip around, intoxicate people with a cheap perfume, use your
accountant vision to see unnoticed details, and other even more in-congruent
abilities.
Characters will unlock their powers while the story unfolds
and you have to decide how those powers could be used to solve the different
puzzles and bizarre situations you will encounter. Why collecting stuff around
if your characters have all they need?


        

Companions can also participate in the conversations
of the main character with the different NPC, if you have the right companion
with you when you are in a dialog he or she can intervene (by quickly clicking in
the exclamation above his or her head) and the talking will have different
conclusion.


         





They are evil, soooo evil! They invented selfies. They are responsible for all that is wrong in the world (of course, it is not human race´s fault!). 
Malebolge Corp. is divided in eight Departments of Sin,
leaded by their Departament Chiefs: from a lustful rapper, to a greedy banker,
from a narcissistic bishop to an evil genius child who creates social
platforms, from politicians to military tyrants. The cream of society is in
charge of this horrible, horrible place.
This place is full of demons, creatures and zombies
who work in their offices, only a 2% of the staff are humans (only because they
deduct). Those humans are desperate people that are convinced to sign a
contract for an eternal job by losing their souls in the process. Even when
they die they will still work in the corporation as zombies.
That’s why our bunch is trying to get out of here and
only you can help them.






We thought we have invented the term, but an internet search
showed us we were wrong. Yes, electro-oldie is an existing term and yes, we
want to use this word to define our core music.
This music is electronic music with the flavour of old
TV series intros and retro games tonalities with a bit of surrealism.
Our musicians, Antonio
Peña and Julián Rodriguez,
great composers and music teachers, that have created OST´s for different films,
had found a perfect breakeven between the retro junk and the electronics. 
This is our main theme, which is always more dynamic
than the other in game tracks, but all the OST in general is full of sutile stridencies
combining electronic harmonies and retrogaming themes.







Cartoons, comics and retro videogames inspired us, and
this is the result, bigheaded expressive characters with stickman bodies, non
auto-smooth animations, speech balloon, a minimalistic interface and agile and
asymmetrical designs in the scenarios. 






  

  

  

  

   




Why shout when you can laugh? Uncensored talk is
great, but uncensored laughs are better.
Let´s laugh about us, about social nonsense, about
people in media, about politics, about any other human aspect. We (Crisis Crunch Team) are masochists, we
like our characters to rant about us as well (they will do it several times
trough the game, you will see), but we are afraid to tell you they will not
stop there, we created a monster! (A bunch of them, in fact) they are no longer
under our control they are thinking by themselves. But we all are thinking
about ourselves ultimately, in this times we are living we must not stop having
critical thinking, but we can have it with a smile.
That’s what Crisis
Crunch wanted; it addresses social problems and then explodes in laughter. Crisis Crunch is meant to be an exhaust
valve for daily frustration, and of course an evasion and a great gaming
experience.












Our
Main Goal in this campaign is get the PART 1 of the game funded. That includes:
 the Prologue and Chapter 1 of the game.
The production will last about 5-7 months
and we will release a free playable demo before PART 1 is finished. The game
will be in Spanish and English languages.
The idea is to make a crowdfunding campaign
for each of the three parts of the game, in total: a prologue and five chapters.
But all depends on our backers. If we have good support in this current campaign maybe we could obtain enough funds to
complete also PART 2 and even PART 3 if we are lucky.
You can see in our Funding Barometer, in
the section below, what quantities we need for funding each part of the
game.
If we reach our main goal and we receive more funds than expected but they are not sufficient to achieve the extra
goal of a new chapter, we will save this money for the production of that
chapter anyway, and when we make the crowdfunding campaign for that part we
will subtract that extra money you gave us in the previous campaign from the
funding goal we establish for the next campaign.  
Even if we reach our goal, our Indiegogo
profile will be active and you will be able to support us during the production of
the parts achieved. Who knows!  Maybe,
while we are working on it, you make possible that another part of the game could
be developed as well.
This campaign profile will be closed before
the last funded part is released. And we will open a new campaign to fund the parts
which remains undone, if there are any left.
Also, the benefits we obtain for the sales
of the firsts parts will be used for the next part and production until the
complete game is finished.




Freedom. 
Indiegogo treat you like an adult who knows what he
wants, who can make his own decisions about what sell and how to introduce it
to the public. And what is important, Indiegogo let the backers decide if a
project it´s worthy of their interest, applying less project pre-selection or
interfering in the team´s way of doing his will based in their best judgment.
That is why we chose Indiegogo for both our current
projects.
Indiegogo works in the same ideological wavelength we
do. Creators must be free to introduce their work at their own way and backers
and players must be free to support or play the project that means something to
them.
· 
Because
videogames are art, and art is abstraction, is relative. 
· 
Because
videogames are experiences and experiences are something intimate and personal.
Standards could be something useful, but why not
convert freedom of expression in a standard?
Funding
Finally, we decide to start a crowdfunding profile in
order to fund this great idea, with this money we can access to the resources
we need, and invest more personal time in the project. 
Your support is essential for us; we want you to feel
free to ask anything, that’s why we pretend to have a well attended social
community. You are OUR backers!



We are not trying to create a community bigger than we
can manage, always quality before quantity or size. To ensure that, we have
Community Managing personnel and a team that dangerously enjoys sharing things
and gossiping about the project.
Working in this kind of projects is a great
experience but, of course, sometimes could be stressful and exhausting.
Receiving your cheers, your commentaries or simply your hellos will make us remember
why we are doing this, besides, we have a lot to do and a lot to learn and you
have a lot to teach us, so we want to be sure you have the correct channels to
do so. 
A community is very useful. In a community there are
always Trimmers (as we call them) people who share their knowledge and give you
a lot of advices and suggestions and also, there are Tanglers, people who gives
you hope and diffuses the news, people that connect us to others, making Crisis Crunch emerge from the shadows
and step up into the digital world.
And of course this and the other spectrums of the
cyber-life conforms The Players, people who love gaming, or maybe potential
players waiting for the perfect occasion to be initiated in the interactive
world, we work for you so…
Trimmers, Tanglers, Players…
Don´t hesitate! Talk to us! We need you! X)



Please, see tiers further explanation in the right column section of this profile.








Remember to specify the name of the chosen tier independently of the quantity donated. It is useful for us and avoid any mistakes.


                

In this and other campaigns that we could make in order to fund and release all the parts of the game, we will see who were the backers that have been supported us most in all this process (even more than one time) and they will have these rewards. So they won´t be effective until the end of THE COMPLETE GAME production. 
Also, some of this rewards are interactive extras for all the players so, obviously, they will be integrated in the final version of the game not in the early released parts.

For the backer that contributes with the highest
quantity of all:


                                                    
                                
                                                
· A Golden trading card of the Hell Prince of the Hellebrities collection based on the Backer
· The capacity to use the spell code engraved in the trading card to summon your Hellebrity (as an NPC) in an specific point of the game
· An important character based on herself or himself or any other person that the backer wanted in our next videogame project (simultaneously projects as Therefore, are not included in this reward)
· An exclusive and unique T-shirt of the game, made by our artists.



To the next 12 backer with the next higher quantities:
                  
· 
A
Silver trading card of one of the twelve Hell barons of the Hellebrities Collection based on the
Backer.


· 
The
capacity to use the spell code engraved in the trading card to summon your Hellebrity (as an NPC) in an specific
point of the game.



To the next 20 backer with the next higher quantities:
                                                    

· 
A
red trading card of one of the stars of the Hellebrities
Collection based on the Backer.



IMPORTANT: 
When the last part of the game will going to released, we will make a public announcement and the auctioned rewards winners will be settled. Those contributions made after this announcement will have no access to auctioned rewards because we will need time to personalize this rewards according to the backer in order for them to have their contribution prizes in time for the launch of the complete game.
In case of having various persons with the same amount of contributions, the reward will be for those who supported us first (considering the date of the donation).


Rewards aclarations:
Hellebrities Trading cards: The most famous collection in the Underworld, Hellebrities represents the sour and
cream of the Hell, the stars of the infernal mass media and high class
The trading cards are hidden in the game scenarios and
you have to found all of them, to unlock some extras in the main menu.
With some auctioned rewards you can have a Hellebrity based in you, we will contact
you in order to ask for some information and some silly answers to some even
sillier questions in order to create your Hellebrity.
If you win the golden or silver auctioned reward we will also create a multiple
choice dialogue with this information.
Also we will give you some tips of where to find your
trading card in the game.
Note: All the Hellebrities
trading cards are interactive content.







You can deduce from this budget that all
team members and collaborators of Team Crunch are passionate for indie projects,
in fact, they have been working until this moment just for passion (that means:
unpaid) and after we have the funding, they are going to work receiving a very
low compensation, normally, less than a half (even a third) of the salary standards
related to their professions. 

Our campaign is in dollars but we are Europeans
so we work with euros in our daily life. The quantities you can see in this
graphics are a dollar translation of the original quantities in euros.








From 110.000 USD we will use the money to support other
aspects of the productions, as game events, press appearances, social
management, upgrades... 





  




Trim Tangle is a nexus of entrepreneurs and creative people who loves
interactive entertainment, games and digital arts. There are several members in
this collective and plenty of ideas and creative proposals arise from its
people.
Actually the core is divided in
two different teams working in two simultaneous videogame projects (Crisis Crunch is one of these games), supporting
each other when is needed. In this web site you can see our profiles. Besides
the teams, there are other nexus members and contacts working in their own
board games or pen and paper role play games or digital and artistic projects.
We consider games a tool to transmit and
express, a tool to connect to others, for us is the perfect channel to send a
message, to generate an experience and, of course, a great way of entertainment.
Videogames nurture from literature, cinema, arts, music and science to create
something unique.
Nevertheless, in this times we are
facing, videogames (and other digital arts) must evolve, not being just a way
of evasion but a way to learn, to understand the human world. Videogames must
not been reclusive but connective.
Adults have been cheated to avoid games,
except those considered appropriate for their ages. With this we made a
terrible mistake, this generation is starting to realize it.
But that doesn’t apply to us, we believe
in games as we believe in any kind of artistic expression, and we see both as
what they are, a way of innovation, vindication and communication, part of the
tangle that weave us together, because we are Trim Tangle.


         
This is one of the teams of the Trim Tangle Nexus, the direct responsibles
of the Crisis Crunch project:
                                    
     Diego Corzón
      Game Designer,    Interactive Writer, Characters,GUI Design and Animation.
                              
“World is changing, humanity is changing, games and
videogames must be part of the change” this messianic deviant is our Game
Designer, an idea breeding machine who always convince us to follow him in his
weird experiments. He is one of the promoters of the Trim Tangle Nexus and is the only one in charge of the two videogames projects supported by Trim
Tangle.
Corzón give his back to a finished Laws Degree and
then studied DGAC (Digital Graphic and Artistic Creation) learning about
traditional and new techniques of illustration, design and animation. Not
having enough, his delirium led him to other weird careers as Narrative
Creation, Interactive Writing and Game Designing, his ultimate passion. Heavens
knows how, he has published tales, articles and essays and has earned some
prizes and nominations in poetry comic and writing minor competitions.
Simultaneously to the both videogame projects (Crisis Crunch and Therefore), he is working in a Pen and Paper project, promoting a
social collective and practicing as a mediator.
 Corzón loves
games and videogames over all, in fact we think he lives in a perpetual
videogame (¿Isla Piñata, maybe?), he uses literature, philosophy, art, comic, Theater and the entire audiovisual spectrum to shape his interactive and
philosophical nonsense, and sometimes, just sometimes, some of them worked.


     David González
      Lead programmer, Web Programmer.
                             
You cannot escape from his eye;
he sees every detail, perceives every change in your mood and localizes any
error. This boy with analytic brain and poetic soul is our lead programmer,
capable of thinking programming solutions while he is ashing his underpants or
taking a beer.
He is hyper responsible and
thorough, he is our inside Trimmer and he doesn't like imperfection. 
Besides being a great opera singer and a daily
philosopher, is a talented Computer Engineer well versed in web and mobile app development, and a hardcore gamer very fond of strategy, graphic adventures
and turn-based RPG. Simultaneously to Crisis
Crunch he is working in an engineering team of a Tech Start-up.
If Corzón is the mother of Crisis Crunch he is the father, giving
birth together the game idea, David never lets “his son” suffering of lack of
attention and care, and always used his time quenching the project everlasting
hunger of productivity .
To David everything matter,
all, even the little things of life and details have their importance (we told
you he was a philosopher) that’s why he thinks inattentive behavior dishonored
a great idea and the effort of a passionate team, and he will not allow that!

    “Hombre Fotolito""
     Graphic Designer and Fx Creator, Character
Designer, Animatics.

                                    
What would happened if you mixed the moods of John
Wayne, the good weave of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo and the artistic perception of
Andy Warhol? Easy you will get “Hombre Fotolito”. He is graphic and artistic
creator, graphic animator, letterer, poster artist and printing expert and he
is known in artistic circles by this name.
He has no fear of proving new thing and is a trustful
partner. If you ask him about help you out in a bizarre project he will look at
you calmly he will take a sip of his Whisky Dry and he will say: When we start?
As his secret identity: Daniel Gutierrez, he has studied DGAC (Digital Graphic and Artistic
Creation), also Graphic Design and Typographic Creation, and has worked as
designer in marketing and communication companies, design studios and printing enterprises.
He loves graphic arts, audiovisuals and videogames.
Paradoxically, his cowboy looks hide a sensible heart
which despairs when see consumerist behavior and he tries to change this from
the inside in his job, you could see a feeble shivering in his eyes when he is
surrounded by “ capitalistic nonsense” (Sales, Black Fridays..). We love him
anyway.

     Melvira
      Background Designer, Concept Artist.

                                     
The beauty of her drawings has an easy explanation,
her hands only canalizes the beauty of her heart. Melvira believes in what
remains beyond the false glitter coverage of the mass media, in the charm of
the easy and caring things. 
Sometime she uses art and eroticism as a way for
people to claim the beauty of all human bodies. As she says: “everyone is
beautiful in its own way”. But sorry folks! Not this time, this time she will
use her art skills to help us create some laughs, a great way as any other to reclaim
the best of us and accept the worst.
She is a great illustrator and concept artist and she studied
Artistic Designing and Illustration and has worked as a concept-artist,
character and GUI designer in recently launched videogame projects as Grumpy Reaper form Drakhar Studios o Kambu Mistery
island. Simultaneously to Crisis
Crunch she is working as a tale illustrator for Blue Tale Company.
Working alongside her is like enter in a Zen garden,
sometimes she felt a little disheartened by the worst part of the world we live
in but the Nexus always returns what it receives (and Melvira is always giving)
so we constantly encourage her to continue inspiring people with her work, full
of freedom of expression and universal acceptance . 

     Julián Rodríguez & Antonio Peña
                          
 -Julián Rodríguez


 OST Composer and Musician.




Julián knows classical
harmonies and experimental ones combined could lead you to something never
achieved before. He has expertise on that.
You could see him
magical appearing in any project where musical innovation is the main theme.
And if this doesn´t satisfy his artistically hunger he will try to innovate and
collaborate with any audiovisual and cultural show. 
He made the Original Soundtrack
of a lot of movies as: “The enchanted Forest”,
""DeProfundis"", “Guts” and many
others including animation and independent films (in some of them he teamed up
with his actual creative companion Antonio Peña) and even made compositions for live theatre.

He graduated in
Composition and Orchestration, Piano and Musical Language and is president of “Colorsonoro”, a Spanish association for electronic
music development and video art. He also teaches in the conservatory.
Nobody trust more than
Julián in the capacity of music to give, and even to guide, guide us into our feelings,
guide us into a story, guide into to the future; for him composition and
innovation must walk side by side.





With his artistic
associate Antonio
 Peñas both form a duo capable of
tearing down any barriers of musical freedom of expression with their head held
high.


-Antonio Peña
OST Composer and Musician
Anything could lead to
music and music could lead us to anything, and that is something Antonio Peñas
realized long time ago. From modern music to the classics, from electro-acoustic
to unplugged, he walk trough all the musical spectrum never making stops.
He is
composer, guitarist, pianist an jazz musician, and has created a Big Band and
played with famous singers as Maite Da Costa,
Julie Guravich, Cristal Méndez Queizán and
others.
He made the OST of both
commercial and independent films as: ""Dreams of a Summer Night”, “The
Apostle” “Wrap up” and many others (some of them in company of his associate Julián Rodriguez).
He also composes for experimental music labs and events while teaching in the
conservatory.
He is as versatile as sound
itself and never loses the chance to show how music could flow through the gaps
in the wall of our collective clichés and start to erode it. We believe that is
what he saw in our Project: a chance to contribute in the creation of a good
laugh-sledgehammer to make social status quo
tremor a little without forgetting to have a good time.
Antonio, as well as his
partner Julián, are both “beyond-goers” as we call them, and they have a outlandish,
funny and professional repertory ready to crash any self-arrogance Crisis Crunch could have.

     María Benítez
Acosta
       Community Manager.

                               


Librarian during the day, Community Manager by night. Worlds of information and
social networking have no secrets for her. Her vocation is to set up
relations, to discover new pathways, to develop alliances. 
Maria studied Library
Science and she worked at the documentation centers of some law
firms and public libraries. Discovering, afterwards, an
unambiguous relation between her past and her future, she decided to study for Community
Manager. Ever since, she didn't stop exploring and (why deny it?) playing with
2.0 web possibilities. 
Currently she collaborates with a librarian web
portal, coordinating sections and writing some posts about social media,
books and libraries. She is also making her first steps in illustration, more
specifically in the dark world of librarian fanzines. 
Always restless, her hobbies are related with art,
design and creation, going from digital to traditional (such as crochet or
decorated cookies). Undoubtedly, this was the key to create such affinity with
the rest of the Nexus (especially for the cookies). 
Her motto is that everything must be perfectly
written, connected, organized and classified, professional bias in its entire splendor.
She will be in charge of dealing with hungry trolls in the virtual
world and helping any curious people that approaches to our project.



Things must change, we all know that. Sometimes addressing  problems with a caustic smile is a powerful tool. We think videogames must
transmit, must be involved in human issues and that includes the social taboos:
politics, religion and mass media. Games are not just entertainment they can
serve for multiples human purposes as, for example, a vindicating tool.
In all our games we want to send a message to  society,
to people, because, without that, you can have a game, yeah maybe, but you
don´t have a game experience. And experiences are what shape us.




1. At the same time we are working in this project we
are trying to survive XD, we have to earn money somehow so most of us have to
spend hours in mid-time jobs and private design requests, funding would help us
to dedicate to our project the time it deserves. Nobody wants a member of team
leaving because he cannot afford to spend his time in the project. That would
be sad because we all know this is what we really want to do, so it wouldn't be
easy for this person to leave.
2. We have to accept it, production peaks happens, but
we are a very stubborn team, in fact all Trim
Tangle Nexus is made of stubborn people (sorry pals, it´s true), we don’t
give up so easily. Production issues have appeared and will appear but we
handled them before and will handle them in the future. Of course, there are
always be less delays if people could focus all their attention to the project
and invest most of their time in its conclusion, again, funding will help us a
lot with this fact.
3. Our greatest nightmare is not to be in touch with
you people! Videogame production could be a very “absorbent” job. But we cannot
allow ourselves to be out of your reach, we have an excellent community manager
and other outer allies who will help us to be constantly updating and sending
you news about the project.
 We begged them
to create a system which forces each one of us, in despite of the production
work, to make a window to personally update some inside info and personally
answer some of your comments from time to time. You are our Backers! (Did I
already say that?)







If you cannot donate, don’t worry friends! You can spread
the word! Be our Tangler!, Be the one that connects us to the backers and
players. Trough Indiegogo you can share our profile in Facebook, Twitter or Youtube, or you can send our web address to friends and family, our Facebook is
hungry for new friends as well as the rest of our social media.

<p>Legacy of
Magic will take the central hero, memorable companions and the epic exploration
of Centura World included intense and epic combats and dungeons and tie it all
together with the emotional writing and mature thematic exploration of this
World.</p>
<p>Combat uses
a tactical real-time with pause system - positioning your party and
coordinating attacks and abilities is one of the keys to success. The world map
is dotted with unique locations and wilderness ripe for exploration and
questing. You’ll create your own character and collect companions along the way
– taking him or her not just through this story, but, with your continued
support, through future adventures. You will engage in dialogues that are deep,
and offer many choices to determine the fate of you and your party. …and you'll
experience a story that explores mature themes and presents you with complex,
difficult choices to shape how your story plays out.</p>
<p>We are
excited at this chance to create something new, yet reminiscent of those great
games and we want you to be a part of it as well. </p>

<p>We have
wanted to go back to our gaming roots and create an epic PC role-playing game
adventure for years. But, it's been almost impossible to get funding through
traditional methods for a game like this. The great thing about Indiegogo is
that we can go directly to the people who love to play RPGs as much as we love
to make them. Plus, we don’t have to make compromises with a publisher. We make
the development decisions, we market the game, and we don't have to answer to
anyone but you – our fans.</p>
<p>Our
relationship with you can be even closer with Indiegogo. We can be more
transparent with development and give you an inside look to what goes on
day-to-day with the programmers, artists, and designers of Legacy of Magic. We
want to give you a behind the scenes look at the game's development, and we
have fun stuff planned like developer blogs, web broadcasts, dev chats, and
much, much more.</p>

<p>We need to
raise $1.1 million to fund an experienced team to do this right. We are asking
for more than a lot of the other Indiegogo projects and that’s because we are
not only making a game, <b>we are creating a whole new world</b>. That means a new RPG
system, entirely new art, new characters and animation and whole lot of lore
and dialogue (in English, German, Russian and Polish). We’ve also designed the
game to have a flexible budget and scope, so if we reach our target budget
goal, we have a list great stuff we can add into the mix through stretch goals.
And, additional money we raise will go straight into the game to add new
levels, companions, NPCs, features, and even entirely new parts of the world
which will add hours and hours to the adventure.</p>

<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>FAQ </b></p>
<p><b>- How will i get my digital copy of the Game?</b></p>
<p>Once the Kickstarter ends, every backer will receive a survey asking them
what platform and distribution network they would like. We now proudly support
both GOG and Steam, so if you prefer DRM-free, you can choose the GOG option,
and if you like Steam's integration, including achievements, and possibly cloud
saves, you'll be able to choose that as well.</p>
<p>If you buy additional copies as add-ons, you'll be able to tell us which
one you want per key.</p>
<p><b>- What languages will LEGACY of MAGIC be
in?</b></p>
<p>The
initial release will be in English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, and
Polish. We are also looking for ways of translating the game for our fans all
over the rest of the world. As we have more information and our funding
increases, we’ll make sure to keep everyone update on what languages will be
coming with Project Eternity.</p>
<p><b>- What about other Platforms?</b></p>
<p>LEGACY
of MAGIC supports Windows PC (€
        1,100,000
        EUR)</p>
<p>XBO,
PS4 = (€
        1,700,000
        EUR)</p>
<p>Xbox
360, PS3 = (€ 2,300,000
        EUR)</p>
<p><b>- Can I use PayPal?</b></p>
<p>Yes!
PayPal support is available via the LEGACY of MAGIC web page at <a href=""http://obelisc.de/paypal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://obelisc.de/paypal</a>. Don't worry if
you missed paying for international shipping - we'll handle this later through
our website. At that point you will be able to pay for shipping or any other
related charges.</p>
<p><b>- What file formats will the Digital
Download of the Soundtrack be available in?</b></p>
<p>We are
going to be offering both MP3 and FLAC formats for the soundtrack when it
becomes available for download.</p>
<p><b>- What are the system requirements for
LEGACY of MAGIC</b></p>
<p>It's
too early in development to give hardware requirements. Our target is to run on
better machines and to support a wide variety of hardware. We will be announcing
the system requirements at a later date so stay tuned for an announcement down
the road.</p>
<p><b>- </b><b>What ist he difference between the Strategy Guide and the Collector’s Book?</b></p>
<p>Strategy
Guide = Tips and Tricks on how to play the game. Collector's Book = Art,
Concepts, Making Of/Behind the Scenes, Monster Info, additional lore, and info
on companions/characters</p>

And, additional money we raise will go straight into the game to add new
levels, companions, NPCs, features, and even entirely new parts of the world
which will add hours and hours to the adventure.

FAQ 
- How will i get my digital copy of the Game?
Once the Kickstarter ends, every backer will receive a survey asking them
what platform and distribution network they would like. We now proudly support
both GOG and Steam, so if you prefer DRM-free, you can choose the GOG option,
and if you like Steam's integration, including achievements, and possibly cloud
saves, you'll be able to choose that as well.
If you buy additional copies as add-ons, you'll be able to tell us which
one you want per key.
- What languages will LEGACY of MAGIC be
in?
The
initial release will be in English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, and
Polish. We are also looking for ways of translating the game for our fans all
over the rest of the world. As we have more information and our funding
increases, we’ll make sure to keep everyone update on what languages will be
coming with Project Eternity.

<p> </p>
<p>Smart Toybox is the first connected toy box that turns cleaning up toys into a fun game.</p>

<p>After the playtime, you can start the clean-up game. The toy box will start singing and calling kids to feed it with toys. When the toy ends up in the box, it will ""chew"" it or ""slurp"" it, say „nom nom nom“, or play some other funny sound. If the toy box is overturned, it will giggle or scream.</p>
<p>You can use our preset sound theme, or define your own sounds. New sounds are easily recorded, tweaked (change sound effects) and transferred to the toy box using 1-click touch in the Smart Toybox's mobile application. Record your voice, cartoon or “cute-ify” it and send it to the toy box, than watch for your child's reaction. Multi language or language neutral themes are supported!</p>

<p>Smart Toybox app (for iOS and Android) extends gameplay to the virtual world and allows kids and parents to be creative using simple touch controls. At the same time, it enhances gameplay with physical box and keeps Smart Toybox exciting for a long time. With mobile app, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>download and share sounds with friends,</li>
<li>easily record new funny sounds,</li>
<li>1-click to send sounds to Smart Toybox,</li>
<li>fully customize toy box's settings.</li>

<p><strong>€150,000 - Create your own game</strong> - If we meet this goal, we will upgrade our mobile application with tool to create your own games for Smart Toybox that is fun and easy to use.

Record your voice, cartoon or “cute-ify” it and send it to the toy box, than watch for your child's reaction. Multi language or language neutral themes are supported!

Mobile App
 

Smart Toybox app (for iOS and Android) extends gameplay to the virtual world and allows kids and parents to be creative using simple touch controls. At the same time, it enhances gameplay with physical box and keeps Smart Toybox exciting for a long time. With mobile app, you can:

download and share sounds with friends,
easily record new funny sounds,
1-click to send sounds to Smart Toybox,
fully customize toy box's settings.

Stretched Goals
 
 €100,000 - Multibox - Smart Toyboxes work together creating pleasant audio from one ""personality"" instead of cacophony of individual boxes. Multiple toy boxes can play additional educational and competitive games, such as learning what is left and what is right, throwing the ball and many more, for both single and multiple children.
€150,000 - Create your own game - If we meet this goal, we will upgrade our mobile application with tool to create your own games for Smart Toybox that is fun and easy to use. This way children and even grownups will easily learn core programming concepts, such as logic, building structure, event handling, etc.

What do we need money for?
We have created Smart Toybox prototype and demo mobile app, and tested it in all sorts of conditions for hundreds of hours, in kindergartens and in the lab. We've listened to your feedback about features, and integrated them into hardware design for the final product.
Now it's time for the last step – manufacturing – and this is where we need your help. We need to cover costs of tooling, procurement of components and setting up the first production batch.

<li>Players in select states, countries and provinces can play competitively to earn credits which are exchangeable for real money paid out in USD.</li>
<li>Play casually for fun if you just want some excitement, and a good time.</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Games shouldn't force you to buy their latest DLC every few months, or make the game unplayable without the latest content pack.

<u>Awareness</u> - Being super indie our <strong>hardest obstacle</strong> is simply getting the game in front of our consumers, you the player basis.

<li>Being Indie - A few years ago, we debuted our idea and a trailer on Steam Greenlight, we quickly rose to the top of the Greenlight program, becoming a top 20 rated  game out of 2200 others on the Greenlight program. After a few weeks we were rejected due incompatibility, they didn't like the fact that we allow players to withdraw their RM credits back out of the game and into their real wallets.

</div><div> <h3></h3>
</div>                                                             About Game: <br/><br/>I've got a plan to create an anti-stress online browser game, as well as a game version for smartphones and tablets. In many Japanese companies one can find specialized rooms, where employees may de-stress themselves. And I would like to move such an anti-stress room to the Internet. For every person could de-stress himself with this game. <br/>The game will allow any person to de-stress himself or herself. But primarily it will de-stress office workers because there is always too much tension and stress at work. Using my game people will have a chance to reduce tension and relax, come back to their normal state of mind and get back to work doing it in a calm way and forgetting about their unpleasant talk to a boss. <br/><br/>                                                                Idea: <br/><br/>The idea of this game came to my mind, when I bought an anti-stress stuffed toy to my lovely niece. Seeing her positive reaction, that volume of unbelievable delight and the way how she treated this toy, I came up with an idea to create such a game. <br/>                                             About One Japanese Tradition: <br/>Large Japanese corporations have special rooms of psychological relaxation. Employees de-stress themselves by throwing darts into their boss' portrait and kicking a dummy portraying him. These rooms even include specialized ""yelling vases"", where you can pour out all your negative emotions. <br/><br/><br/>                                                      Learn More About Game: <br/><br/>A player will have a chance to submit photos and select from a number of special tools. A free account will have the following tools: <br/><br/>1.throw a snowball, <br/><br/>2.cake, <br/><br/>3.tomatoes, <br/><br/>4.berries <br/><br/>Premium account users will have the following tools: <br/><br/>1.Boxing gloves, <br/><br/>2.a chance to paint a photo, <br/><br/>3.paintball, <br/><br/>4.darts <br/><br/>The picture, of course, will change depending on what tools will be applied to it. <br/>                                                                    <div>                                                                   I Know: <br/>I know how the game should look like. The only thing left is to make this come true.

                                                             About Game: I've got a plan to create an anti-stress online browser game, as well as a game version for smartphones and tablets. In many Japanese companies one can find specialized rooms, where employees may de-stress themselves. And I would like to move such an anti-stress room to the Internet. For every person could de-stress himself with this game. The game will allow any person to de-stress himself or herself. But primarily it will de-stress office workers because there is always too much tension and stress at work. Using my game people will have a chance to reduce tension and relax, come back to their normal state of mind and get back to work doing it in a calm way and forgetting about their unpleasant talk to a boss.                                                                 Idea: The idea of this game came to my mind, when I bought an anti-stress stuffed toy to my lovely niece. Seeing her positive reaction, that volume of unbelievable delight and the way how she treated this toy, I came up with an idea to create such a game.                                              About One Japanese Tradition: Large Japanese corporations have special rooms of psychological relaxation. Employees de-stress themselves by throwing darts into their boss' portrait and kicking a dummy portraying him. These rooms even include specialized ""yelling vases"", where you can pour out all your negative emotions.                                                       Learn More About Game: A player will have a chance to submit photos and select from a number of special tools. A free account will have the following tools: 1.throw a snowball, 2.cake, 3.tomatoes, 4.berries Premium account users will have the following tools: 1.Boxing gloves, 2.a chance to paint a photo, 3.paintball, 4.darts The picture, of course, will change depending on what tools will be applied to it.                                                                                                                                        I Know: I know how the game should look like. The only thing left is to make this come true. I've already got a team of specialists, who will execute this plan.                                                                                                                                                  How My Game Differs from Others:

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">      We all have <span style=""background-color: initial;"">habits we would like to change. For me, it's sugar. For other people it might be soft drinks, tobacco or fried foods, to name a few. Even though we know that changing these habits is in our best interest, it can be hard to do. This game is aimed to help us live a healthier life using science. </span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">      My name is Jordan. I am currently starting my PhD in cognitive neuroscience. But before I begin the mind-numbing tedium of pushing out scientific journal articles, I wanted to make something that was actually useful to people. This game is that something. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<br/>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">      The idea is simple. When we see something we get pleasure from, we want it. For me, when I walk down a super market isle and see a candy bar, I know I will get pleasure from eating it, and so I tend to want it. This game allows us to practice dissociating the stimulus from reward; essentially it is practice at ignoring the object of habit. This is where the game gets the name 'Mizaru' from; Mizaru is the name of the 'see no evil' monkey. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">    Though the idea may seem almost too simple, it has some backing in science. There are several studies demonstrating that inhibiting (stopping) a response to pictures of unhealthy food, while responding to healthy food, can affect open eating choices (see for example Veloing, Aarts &amp; Stroebe, 2013 and Houben &amp; Jansen, 2011). </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">      When I initially read these studies, I thought they were pretty neat, but very limited. It seemed unlikely that people would sit down and push a button for half an hour before they go out to eat. So my idea is to make this into an accessible smart phone app, which can be played a few minutes at a time, and overtime help us live a healthier life. Further, I have extended the boundaries of what this app will target. The current list of habits targeted include: </div>

So I wish to use the funding from this project to: </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Help optimize the game for smart phones</b></div>
<div><b>Extend the games parameters, including further images for each category</b></div>
<div><b>Get help from a designer to make the game look and play better</b></div>
<div><b>Make music for the game</b></div>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">      Secondly, I think crowdfunding is the best way to spread awareness about this game.

<div><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">      Tied to this is the third reason for using Indiegogo for funding this game, and is the real reason I am making this game. I would like to use feedback from players of this game to see which categories, under which types of games and in what conditions, helped them the most. This will guild further research into the area. For example, if it turns out practicing ignoring spiders makes people less afraid when they see a spider, then I can follow up with this in the lab, using objective measures of fear to see how people will respond after playing these types of games. So really, I want people to have an app that allows them to change their habits. I want it to be the best game it can be. And I want your help to guild that process. </div>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">      Secondly, it is worth noting that, though there has been studies done on this topic, the field is still rather young.

      We all have habits we would like to change. For me, it's sugar. For other people it might be soft drinks, tobacco or fried foods, to name a few. Even though we know that changing these habits is in our best interest, it can be hard to do. This game is aimed to help us live a healthier life using science. 


      My name is Jordan. I am currently starting my PhD in cognitive neuroscience. But before I begin the mind-numbing tedium of pushing out scientific journal articles, I wanted to make something that was actually useful to people. This game is that something. 


How it works


      The idea is simple. When we see something we get pleasure from, we want it. For me, when I walk down a super market isle and see a candy bar, I know I will get pleasure from eating it, and so I tend to want it. This game allows us to practice dissociating the stimulus from reward; essentially it is practice at ignoring the object of habit. This is where the game gets the name 'Mizaru' from; Mizaru is the name of the 'see no evil' monkey. 

    Though the idea may seem almost too simple, it has some backing in science. There are several studies demonstrating that inhibiting (stopping) a response to pictures of unhealthy food, while responding to healthy food, can affect open eating choices (see for example Veloing, Aarts & Stroebe, 2013 and Houben & Jansen, 2011). 

      When I initially read these studies, I thought they were pretty neat, but very limited. It seemed unlikely that people would sit down and push a button for half an hour before they go out to eat. So my idea is to make this into an accessible smart phone app, which can be played a few minutes at a time, and overtime help us live a healthier life. Further, I have extended the boundaries of what this app will target. The current list of habits targeted include: 
Tobacco


Marijuana




Sugary foods



Fried foods 



Alcohol 



Soft drinks 




      I have also included three further categories which fall under a slightly different area: 
Inactivity (being lazy)



Snakes



Spiders





     There are two types of games I have included in the program so far. Firstly I have made a game sort of like Fruit Ninja:
    

      In this game, you basically cut the good food, while avoiding the bad food.    
 
      And secondly I have made a game like Wac-a-Mole:

This game is also a little trickier, in the final level (of 5) of difficulty, the color of the hats sometimes lies to you.
