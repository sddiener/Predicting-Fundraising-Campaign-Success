<p>ABH2O cross-water walking skis are stable, safe and easy to use. The ski is designed so it cannot flip over.</p>

It offers total body movement, all muscles workout and is very good for burning calories and improving the overall physical fitness. Muscles of legs, arms, the lower and the upper body are worked out. </p>
<p>Depending on the skill level, the skis can be used for sea, lake, river, pond, or swimming pool cross-water walking. Our skis will be also designed so they can be easily assembled and disassembled to fit in any car.</p>
<p>Final products will be made from unsinkable plastic materials.</p>
<p>Steps for using the skis:</p>
<p>1. Ready: Put the skis on water.</p>
<p>2. Set: Step on the skis.</p>
<p>3. Go: Walk on water.</p>

C. Weiss, ABH2O skis bring cross country skiing to the water, GIZMAG, November 27, 2013)ABH2O Cross-Water Walking SkisWe have passionately developed and tested different prototypes of cross-water walking skis over the past two years resulting in a working prototype, which represents a new invention, a new design and a solution, which emphasizes stability, safety and simplicity. Funding will be used for next steps and will represent a support for global development of cross-water walking sports and recreation.
Next Steps
January - March 2014: Design and development of production tools and testing of finalized products. We will develop and produce five molds, which will be used in rotational molding production of ABH2O Cross-Water Walking Skis and poles.
April 2014: First product deliveries.


Product - A Set of ABH2O Cross-Water Walking Skis and Poles

ABH2O Cross-Water Walking Skis (a pair),  plus a pair of poles.
Color: Yellow.
Approximate measures of one ski:
Length: 6.5 feet (198 cm). Weight: 23 pounds (10.5 kg).
Note: All ABH2O cross-water walking skis and poles displayed at this website are prototypes; all designs are still under development.
Description & Use
ABH2O cross-water walking skis are stable, safe and easy to use. The ski is designed so it cannot flip over.
Cross-water walking on our skis is similar in movement to cross-country skiing, with a reduced pressure on ankles and knees. It offers total body movement, all muscles workout and is very good for burning calories and improving the overall physical fitness. Muscles of legs, arms, the lower and the upper body are worked out. 
Depending on the skill level, the skis can be used for sea, lake, river, pond, or swimming pool cross-water walking. Our skis will be also designed so they can be easily assembled and disassembled to fit in any car.
Final products will be made from unsinkable plastic materials.
Steps for using the skis:
1. Ready: Put the skis on water.
2. Set: Step on the skis.
3. Go: Walk on water.

<p>Mesh Wi-Fi is a technology pioneered for airports, malls and enterprises
and one we believe will become the new standard for smart homes. </p>
<p>Chimes use Mesh Wi-Fi technology to communicate with each
other so they share the work of providing a strong and reliable Wi-Fi across
your home.  So if a
signal from one Chime becomes weak as you move in the house, another Chime will
be able to provide a stronger signal to your device, without losing
connectivity. </p>

<p>Yes. Unlike many Wi-Fi extenders, Chime will not decrease the speed of your home Wi-Fi. <b>Extenders may reduce the speed of your internet connection by up to 50%</b>, because they often use a single radio to send data between routers and extenders, and to connect to your devices. Chime uses separate and dedicated radios for these tasks. <b>With Chime your internet speed stays as fast as it can be.</b></p>

<p>Chime
creates a single hotspot for all your devices using both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands.
Newer devices like iPhones and iPads connect to the faster 5Ghz band,
and older devices connect to the slower 2.4Ghz band. It all happens automatically,
so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Running our campaign on Indiegogo is not about raising funds, but about engaging directly with people who want and need Chime.</p>
<p>Our goal is to protect people, their families and
devices. In the new paradigm of the connected home, we found that the best way
to this is by running security software on the home network to safeguard your connected devices. The logical place for this software is the
router.</p>
<p>However, our research showed that many people are

<p><b>1. Can I expect better Wi-Fi performance?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we designed Chime to improve your Wi-Fi connection, though your mileage may vary. We designed Chime using Mesh Wi-Fi Technology. Multiple Chimes that work together give you stronger and more reliable signal in the corners of your home. Existing routers can’t give you that. Each Chime is a powerful 802.11ac dual-band router, so just one Chime should offer you better performance than your existing single-band router.</p>
<p><b>2. How is Chime different from other routers?</b></p>
<p>Chime uses Mesh Wi-Fi Technology to create a single wireless network across your home, just like in offices, airports and malls. Chime also runs AVG’s security and privacy software right on the router, so it helps protect your connected devices. Chime is designed to create a new bar for home Wi-Fi routers.</p>
<p><b>3. How is Chime better than a range extender?</b></p>
<p>Unlike many Wi-Fi extenders, Chime will not decrease the speed of your home Wi-Fi. Extenders may reduce the speed of your internet connection by up to 50%, because they use a single radio to send data between routers and extenders, and to connect to your devices. Chime uses separate and dedicated radios for these tasks, so your internet speed stays as fast as it can be.</p>
<p><b>4. Will Chime work with my Internet Service Provider (ISP) and existing network setup?</b></p>
<p>Chime will work with most major ISPs and should easily fit into your existing network setup.</p>
<p><b>5. How many connected devices can Chime support?</b></p>
<p>Lots. Each Chime on its own is a powerful dual-band router, so it can support dozens of devices, depending on the device. So, if you have 2 or 3 Chimes installed in different rooms in your home, you probably won’t need to worry about running out of capacity for a while.</p>
<p><b>6. How many Chimes do I need for my house?</b></p>
<p>To get the best out of Chime, we recommend you start with 2 Chimes for an average-sized home. If you have a large home or if your home has many stories/thick walls, go for 3 or even more. And finally, if you have a small house or apartment, why not install a single Chime?  There’s a lot more to Chime than just strong Wi-Fi, like intrusion protection for your devices, and those of your visitors.</p>
<p><b>7. Will Chime work for my multi-story / thick-walled home?</b></p>
<p>Chime is actually designed for a house like yours, in which traditional routers/Wi-Fi extenders just can’t seem to work.  </p>
<p><b>8. How does Chime protect my connected devices?</b></p>
<p>As a security company, we designed Chime for exactly this reason. Chime runs AVG’s security software on the router to analyze incoming and outgoing traffic from your internet-connected devices. A router is the best place to protect your connected home against malware and phishing attacks.</p>
<p><b>9. What duties and local taxes are charged on my order?</b></p>
<p>For orders to US and Canada local taxes, like duties and sales tax, are not included and will be charged on delivery. For orders to the EU, VAT is included in the shipping costs.</p>

AVG Technologies. AVG is a leading internet security provider, with more than
200 million monthly active users worldwide. AVG created the world’s most
popular anti-virus solution and one of the most downloaded Android Antivirus.





Mesh Wi-Fi is a network technology used for airports, malls,
and large enterprises to offer Wi-Fi to hundreds of people and devices at once.
Chime is also the next
generation of online threat protection platform for connected homes. Chime
provides a new layer of security for your connected devices, especially those
not protected by an anti-virus – like Webcams, Thermostats, Printers and your
guests’ devices.

Oh, and did we already tell you that Chime will come with the latest
generation hardware? This will make it a real powerhouse and make your home future ready.








 



Mesh Wi-Fi is a technology pioneered for airports, malls and enterprises
and one we believe will become the new standard for smart homes. 
Chimes use Mesh Wi-Fi technology to communicate with each
other so they share the work of providing a strong and reliable Wi-Fi across
your home.  So if a
signal from one Chime becomes weak as you move in the house, another Chime will
be able to provide a stronger signal to your device, without losing
connectivity. 








Yes. Unlike many Wi-Fi extenders, Chime will not decrease the speed of your home Wi-Fi. Extenders may reduce the speed of your internet connection by up to 50%, because they often use a single radio to send data between routers and extenders, and to connect to your devices. Chime uses separate and dedicated radios for these tasks. With Chime your internet speed stays as fast as it can be.





Chime
creates a single hotspot for all your devices using both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands.
Newer devices like iPhones and iPads connect to the faster 5Ghz band,
and older devices connect to the slower 2.4Ghz band. It all happens automatically,
so you don’t have to worry about it.







One 
– covers a typical apartment
Chime on its own can cover a typical
apartment and support up to 50 devices. 
Two 
– cover an average house
Chimes are
strong enough to cover an average house and stream
Netflix even from spots that used to get a single bar. 
Three 
– cover larger homes and gardens
Using three Chimes increases the
Wi-Fi coverage enough for even larger homes and gardens.
















As the number of internet-connected devices in our homes is increasing, the number of potential entry points into our homes is also increasing. A recent study carried out by HP showed that 70 percent of the most commonly used Internet of Things devices contain serious vulnerabilities (HP, 2014). 
Many of these devices have access to sensitive information, such as your address, whether or not you are home, health information and even banking information. This makes connected devices an interesting target for hackers. Especially ones that are not protected by an anti-virus like Webcams, Thermostats and Printers.
We believe the best way to protect your family and devices is by securing your connected home at the internet access point, the router. 







Chime runs anti-virus for your entire home, to help protect the connected devices in your home. All at no additional costs.
Chime can block malware links before they even load on your device.



Chime is equipped with VPN and Tor to give you more control over your
online privacy. Chime makes VPN especially simple by creating a dedicated hotspot where all your connected devices can be easily routed through.
AVG operates hundreds of VPN servers, allowing you to: 






Set
     up your network in minutes with the Chime app for Android
     or iOS. The app gives you easy-to-follow
     steps for setting up your Wi-Fi network. 







Manage your devices, privacy, and your kids' internet activity, any time, from any place,
with the Chime app.




A mere 1 inch tall and wall-mountable, Chime combines innovative technology with elegant design. Place it anywhere!

<br/><p>We have designed the Sweet Pea WiFi shield to help you with all that. The Sweet Pea WiFi Shield hold the latest WiFi technology from Texas Instruments giving you the absolute best WiFi value for money that you can get for an embedded system today. And by using that innovative WiFi technology from Texas Instrument we were left with an awful lot of free board space, so we figured that we would put all the things that you normally need in there as well.</p></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span><h3>Software<br/>

<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>And what about software you might wonder ? For this type of product software is <b>absolutely vital</b>, and we have created a very simple to use but still amazingly powerful Arduino library that plugs right into the Arduino IDE. Simple and well documented examples show you exactly how to build you own WiFi enabled applications.</p>
<p>The library support two levels of programmers. The base level is targeted to the seasoned programmer that knows how to work with sockets and is familiar with network programming. This level gives you the maximum flexibility when creating your applications.<br/></p>
<p>The second level, the user level, is for people that is just starting to get to know Arduino, maybe even just getting in to programming. Or people that just want to get their projects flying quickly. If you select to enter this level of writing your applications you will only use very few functions to do your network communication. The library will do the rest for you.</p>
<p>We have even included simple to use interfaces for posting data online to services like <a href=""http://sen.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sen.se.</a> You can check out our live temperature feed <a href=""http://open.sen.se/sweetpeasleofi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> from one of our prototypes.<br/></p>
<p>The library have been flying for quite some time with a number of beta testers and we have listened hard to what they have had to say to make things easier for you. It is pretty much ready for release and will be fully available by the time your boards arrive.</p></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span><h3>Configuration and compatibility<br/>
</h3>
<p>The Sweet Pea WiFi shield is compatible with all Arduino CPU boards and configuration jumpers on the shield lets you change the pin configuration that will allow the shield to operate together with many other shields.</p>
<p>We have tested the Sweet Pea WiFi shield on all currently available Arduino CPU boards without any problems. The software support for the Arduino Due is however not fully tested as of today.</p>
<p>We have also tested the board on Seeedstudio CPU boards without problems.<br/></p>

The third prototypes are the ones on the pictures here. The final boards will be very similar, there are just a few cosmetic and compatibility issues that have been fixed.<br/></p>
<p>We need to produce a minimum of 100 units to be able to provide them at a reasonable cost. If we are successful and you are a backer we hope that we can deliver your board(s) before the Christmas hacker Holiday, but we can't guarantee this.<br/></p>
<p>Contributing to this project will allow you to introduce WiFi functionality to all your existing Arduino designs as well as new designs and at the same time it will enable us to provide you with more exciting projects in the future.<br/></p>
<h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><h3>About the Sweet Pea WiFi Shield</h3></span></span></h3>
<h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></h3>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>The Sweet Pea WiFi Shield is a Rev. 3 Arduino compatible Shield that works with pretty much any Arduino CPU board that you can find out there. We've tried it on basically all Arduino CPU boards as well as Seeedstudio boards and they all work fine. <br/></p>
<p>It is a bit shorter than the average shield which means that it fits snugly just behind the bulky USB connector of the Arduino Uno. It protrudes a little more towards the rear of the board in order to accommodate the on board chip antenna.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier the Shield integrates a number of function blocks on the same board. These function blocks are:</p></span></span><ul>
<li>WiFi - What the WiFi Shield is all about</li>
<li>RTC - Basically everyone wants to keep the time</li>
<li>SD Card - An SD card socket, to store web data and such</li>
<li>SRAM - 128 KBytes of battery backed up SRAM</li>
<li>LED driver - An I2C based I/O expander<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Wifi</h4>
<p>With the introduction of the CC3000 chip from Texas Instrument, integrating WiFi into small embedded systems design have become extremely simple. Normally you need to have some sort of user interface to be able to enter information such as SSID, encryption keys and more in order for the unit to be able to connect to the wireless network. The CC3000 moves the configuration of these parameters from the target system up to your PC, mobile phone or tablet making your Arduino design much much easier.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/13541/files/20130815050228-Cc3000_smart_config.PNG?1376568148"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Support for iOS, Android and Windows is currently available.</p>
<p>The board comes with two different antenna options. Option number one is the on board chip antenna. This antenna is surprisingly good and have produced very high Rssi readings throughout our tests. But it doesn't really matter how good the on board antenna is if you have to mount your board inside a metal enclosure. In this case you need the board with the U.FL. micro connector on it. With this you can add an RF pigtail (not included) to you board and have a standard SMA connector mounted on your enclosure.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/138894/files/20131017121618-indie-antennas.JPG?1382037378"" src="""" style=""""/></p>For more detailed information on how the CC3000 operates I would recommend that you visit the <a href=""http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC3000"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Texas Instrument Wiki</a>. There you will find all the information you will ever need.<br/><h4>RTC</h4>
<p>We have included a standard DS1307 real time clock that keeps the time while your units are powered off (when a battery is present). There is already plenty of support in the Arduino community for this device so getting it up and running will be very easy. Please notice that due to shipping restrictions no battery will be shipped. The final board will have a CR2032 socket instead where a battery needs to be installed.<br/></p>
<h4>SD Card</h4>
<p>Of course we included an SD Card. When doing web pages you need to have a lot of storage for web pages, scripts, pictures and icons. An inexpensive SD card solves that. We included a proper level translator design on the board that will work in all environments. Again, the Arduino community have a lot of support for handling SD cards and our solution is 100% hardware compatible.<br/></p>
<h4>SRAM</h4>
<p>When working with sensor data you might find yourself in a situation where you just can't afford to loose any data at all. In this case it can be a life saver to have some form of fast cache memory that allows you to store the data for later processing. We have included a serial 128KByte battery backed up SRAM on the board. It will allow you to store your data very quickly without the need for a file system that slows you down. The previously mentioned library supports this device fully.</p></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span><h4>LED's</h4>
<p>While not being an important part of the system we have also provided a 4 pin I2C expander that drives 4 status LED's. The CC3000 does not support external indicator LED's which is why we decided to provide this as a separate function block on the board. 3 LED's are used by the driver library to indicate the following status:</p>
<ol>
<li>Link Up</li>
<li>Activity</li>
<li>Error</li>
</ol>
<p>There's also a user definable LED that you can program yourself through an API in the library.</p></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span><h3>And a short note about connectors</h3>
<p>The unit ships with a set of stackable connectors that are not soldered to the board so that anyone that wants to use standard pin headers instead (like the ones we've used on the board in the pictures) can do so. <br/></p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span><h3>
<span class=""notranlsate""><h3>V.A.T. and other non technical issues</h3></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span>
</h3>
<p>Aha, this where it gets confusing. Due to European tax laws the following apply to the different perks:<br/></p></span></span></span></span></span><ul>
<li>If you are a EU citizen, you need to pay Swedish V.A.T</li>
<li>If you are a EU organization with a valid V.A.T. registration you don't need to pay V.A.T. but you need to inform us of your V.A.T. registration number.</li>
<li>Everyone else on the globe does not need to pay V.A.T.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Please use the appropriate perk when purchasing your item. Should you select the incorrect perk, don't worry, in that case we will contact you before shipping out your unit to complete the order. </p>

The second level, the user level, is for people that is just starting to get to know Arduino, maybe even just getting in to programming. Or people that just want to get their projects flying quickly. If you select to enter this level of writing your applications you will only use very few functions to do your network communication. The library will do the rest for you.
We have even included simple to use interfaces for posting data online to services like http://sen.se. You can check out our live temperature feed here from one of our prototypes.
The library have been flying for quite some time with a number of beta testers and we have listened hard to what they have had to say to make things easier for you. It is pretty much ready for release and will be fully available by the time your boards arrive.Configuration and compatibility

The Sweet Pea WiFi shield is compatible with all Arduino CPU boards and configuration jumpers on the shield lets you change the pin configuration that will allow the shield to operate together with many other shields.
We have tested the Sweet Pea WiFi shield on all currently available Arduino CPU boards without any problems. The software support for the Arduino Due is however not fully tested as of today.
We have also tested the board on Seeedstudio CPU boards without problems.
Current status

What we have done so far is to build three different versions of prototypes to ensure that what we have designed is working as you will expect it to be working. The third prototypes are the ones on the pictures here. The final boards will be very similar, there are just a few cosmetic and compatibility issues that have been fixed.
We need to produce a minimum of 100 units to be able to provide them at a reasonable cost. If we are successful and you are a backer we hope that we can deliver your board(s) before the Christmas hacker Holiday, but we can't guarantee this.
Contributing to this project will allow you to introduce WiFi functionality to all your existing Arduino designs as well as new designs and at the same time it will enable us to provide you with more exciting projects in the future.
About the Sweet Pea WiFi Shield

The Sweet Pea WiFi Shield is a Rev. 3 Arduino compatible Shield that works with pretty much any Arduino CPU board that you can find out there. We've tried it on basically all Arduino CPU boards as well as Seeedstudio boards and they all work fine. 
It is a bit shorter than the average shield which means that it fits snugly just behind the bulky USB connector of the Arduino Uno. It protrudes a little more towards the rear of the board in order to accommodate the on board chip antenna.
As mentioned earlier the Shield integrates a number of function blocks on the same board. These function blocks are:
WiFi - What the WiFi Shield is all about
RTC - Basically everyone wants to keep the time
SD Card - An SD card socket, to store web data and such
SRAM - 128 KBytes of battery backed up SRAM
LED driver - An I2C based I/O expander


Wifi
With the introduction of the CC3000 chip from Texas Instrument, integrating WiFi into small embedded systems design have become extremely simple. Normally you need to have some sort of user interface to be able to enter information such as SSID, encryption keys and more in order for the unit to be able to connect to the wireless network. The CC3000 moves the configuration of these parameters from the target system up to your PC, mobile phone or tablet making your Arduino design much much easier.
Support for iOS, Android and Windows is currently available.
The board comes with two different antenna options. Option number one is the on board chip antenna. This antenna is surprisingly good and have produced very high Rssi readings throughout our tests. But it doesn't really matter how good the on board antenna is if you have to mount your board inside a metal enclosure. In this case you need the board with the U.FL. micro connector on it. With this you can add an RF pigtail (not included) to you board and have a standard SMA connector mounted on your enclosure.
For more detailed information on how the CC3000 operates I would recommend that you visit the Texas Instrument Wiki. There you will find all the information you will ever need.RTC
We have included a standard DS1307 real time clock that keeps the time while your units are powered off (when a battery is present). There is already plenty of support in the Arduino community for this device so getting it up and running will be very easy. Please notice that due to shipping restrictions no battery will be shipped. The final board will have a CR2032 socket instead where a battery needs to be installed.
SD Card
Of course we included an SD Card. When doing web pages you need to have a lot of storage for web pages, scripts, pictures and icons. An inexpensive SD card solves that. We included a proper level translator design on the board that will work in all environments. Again, the Arduino community have a lot of support for handling SD cards and our solution is 100% hardware compatible.
SRAM
When working with sensor data you might find yourself in a situation where you just can't afford to loose any data at all. In this case it can be a life saver to have some form of fast cache memory that allows you to store the data for later processing. We have included a serial 128KByte battery backed up SRAM on the board. It will allow you to store your data very quickly without the need for a file system that slows you down. The previously mentioned library supports this device fully.LED's
While not being an important part of the system we have also provided a 4 pin I2C expander that drives 4 status LED's. The CC3000 does not support external indicator LED's which is why we decided to provide this as a separate function block on the board. 3 LED's are used by the driver library to indicate the following status:

Link Up
Activity
Error

There's also a user definable LED that you can program yourself through an API in the library.And a short note about connectors
The unit ships with a set of stackable connectors that are not soldered to the board so that anyone that wants to use standard pin headers instead (like the ones we've used on the board in the pictures) can do so. 

V.A.T. and other non technical issues

Aha, this where it gets confusing. Due to European tax laws the following apply to the different perks:
If you are a EU citizen, you need to pay Swedish V.A.T
If you are a EU organization with a valid V.A.T. registration you don't need to pay V.A.T. but you need to inform us of your V.A.T. registration number.
Everyone else on the globe does not need to pay V.A.T.


Please use the appropriate perk when purchasing your item. Should you select the incorrect perk, don't worry, in that case we will contact you before shipping out your unit to complete the order. 
Still got question, don't hesitate to ask.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p></p>
<p>We have
developed a very exciting new product that is patent pending, field tested and
ready to fly.<span>  We have named it the
“Wash-Pak” and will run with the “Jr” sized model as we believe it will be the
most popular.  In short it is best
described as a quality manufactured pack with a pullout sink!  There are packs offered by retailers that
will hold all of your hygiene products but we believe they all fall short as
most of the products are best used with a sink like the soap and toothpaste and
no sink is available in the outdoors. </span></p>
<p>When you
view our video you will see a product that is well thought out and
developed.<span>  We have designed for the
maximum market and identified each of them. 
Campers, pilots, bikers, preppers / survivalists, boaters, victims of
disasters, military, rescue workers, Girl &amp; Boy Scouts and disabled
campers.  A very impressive list with any
one or two alone creating a sizable market. 
</span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<span><p>How well
thought out is it?<span>  We designed it to
attach to anything!  The adjustable strap
will hug even large trees, sailboat masts, street light poles and as shown in
the video below the pack can even easily attach to the side of a car!</span></p></span><p><span>

<p>As a company
we are committed to not only providing quality products but ones that will
greatly improve the owners outdoor experience and we feel that campers will
love having the ability to wash at the campsite vs. walking over to a public
restroom.</p>
<p>Yet another
way of classifying this product, it is a portable medicine cabinet.<span>  Designed to be weatherproof it can be left
out during the entire trip and can store everything you have back at your home
cabinet and more.</span></p>
<p>To ensure
everything runs smoothly we have outsourced manufacturing, logistics and
warehousing to a Phoenix AZ company, <a href=""https://www.pinnacletents.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pinnacle Tents</a>.<span>  They have a great reputation so our project
is in good hands and stands a high chance of success, very high.</span></p>

<p><b>What We
Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We are all ready to fly and need fuel in our wings.<span>  We require the funds to purchase the first
run of 1,000 packs (minimum order) which will cost $13,500.00 plus an
additional $2,500.00 for shipping and other related costs including a buffer for unseen
expences.  </span></p>
<p>If we go over our $15,000.00 target we will just increase our
order, this isn’t a problem but a very good thing.<span>  As we increase our product run the cost to
manufacture each unit will go down and our savings increase.</span></p>
<p>At each perk we listed the retail cost and savings which is
considerable.<span>  We are basically offering
our quality product as a “presale” offer. 
You will also be the first to get the product with others months behind.</span></p>
<p>You can also <strong>pick your color</strong> as the pack will be manufactured
in 6 colors as shown below.</p>

<p>Your pack will <u>not</u> include the products included in

shipping from RBS to you in your country and feel you should get a better deal
please pass it on.  It is nice to offer
free shipping to everyone but it differs dramatically from one area to the
next.  If you check shipping use La
Pointe WI, zip code 54850 as the “from” location and they weigh about 2.3 lbs

<p></p>

<p><span>I had interviewed a man in a wheelchair, showed the product, how it

Our Russell Bay Team

 



Charles R. Nelson
Hi!  My name is
Charles “Chuck” Nelson and I am the president of our new start-up company named
Russell Bay Shelters LLP.  I am the
designer, I make all of the prototypes, graphics work and marketing.
At this point in the game our company headquarters is a
10’x10’ office with a sewing machine, drafting table and computer, this is
where our designs come to life!  A lot of
very awesome designs!
People always comment that judging from our progress,
designs and aggressive goals we appear to be far larger then we actually are
which we take as a great complement!
Our focus at this point is to launch our new product the
“Wash-Pak”TM ,
networking and to build lasting relationships that will help our fledgling
company grow.  To us Indiegogo isn’t just
about the funding but networking and getting out there.
If you would like to learn more about me you can go to my

 Martin E.
Nelson Jr.
Marty Nelson is a USAF veteran and
is presently beginning his nineteenth year as a high school
engineering and technology teacher in the Montgomery County Public School
system in Maryland.  He enjoys teaching teenagers about technological
issues and principles of engineering career fields.  Though the curriculum
is exciting and very interesting, he says interacting with his students is
the best part of his job.


OUR
PROJECT



We have
developed a very exciting new product that is patent pending, field tested and
ready to fly.  We have named it the
“Wash-Pak” and will run with the “Jr” sized model as we believe it will be the
most popular.  In short it is best
described as a quality manufactured pack with a pullout sink!  There are packs offered by retailers that
will hold all of your hygiene products but we believe they all fall short as
most of the products are best used with a sink like the soap and toothpaste and
no sink is available in the outdoors. 
When you
view our video you will see a product that is well thought out and
developed.  We have designed for the
maximum market and identified each of them. 
Campers, pilots, bikers, preppers / survivalists, boaters, victims of
disasters, military, rescue workers, Girl & Boy Scouts and disabled
campers.  A very impressive list with any
one or two alone creating a sizable market. 



How well
thought out is it?  We designed it to
attach to anything!  The adjustable strap
will hug even large trees, sailboat masts, street light poles and as shown in
the video below the pack can even easily attach to the side of a car!

As a company
we are committed to not only providing quality products but ones that will
greatly improve the owners outdoor experience and we feel that campers will
love having the ability to wash at the campsite vs. walking over to a public
restroom.
Yet another
way of classifying this product, it is a portable medicine cabinet.  Designed to be weatherproof it can be left
out during the entire trip and can store everything you have back at your home
cabinet and more.
To ensure
everything runs smoothly we have outsourced manufacturing, logistics and
warehousing to a Phoenix AZ company, Pinnacle Tents.  They have a great reputation so our project
is in good hands and stands a high chance of success, very high.

What We
Need & What You Get
We are all ready to fly and need fuel in our wings.  We require the funds to purchase the first
run of 1,000 packs (minimum order) which will cost $13,500.00 plus an
additional $2,500.00 for shipping and other related costs including a buffer for unseen
expences.  
If we go over our $15,000.00 target we will just increase our
order, this isn’t a problem but a very good thing.  As we increase our product run the cost to
manufacture each unit will go down and our savings increase.
At each perk we listed the retail cost and savings which is
considerable.  We are basically offering
our quality product as a “presale” offer. 
You will also be the first to get the product with others months behind.
You can also pick your color as the pack will be manufactured
in 6 colors as shown below.




So, you are also free to mix them up when buying more then
one.  Want 4 then get 1-blue, 2-red and
1- maroon.  
Your pack will not include the products included in
the video, you will get a pack with the mirror and will need to supply the
contents before use.  We have found that
the best place to purchase your contents is at a large store where small sample
sized product is sold like for airline use.
Please feel free to message me with perk requests and I will
look into it.  Also, if you check the
shipping from RBS to you in your country and feel you should get a better deal
please pass it on.  It is nice to offer
free shipping to everyone but it differs dramatically from one area to the
next.  If you check shipping use La
Pointe WI, zip code 54850 as the “from” location and they weigh about 2.3 lbs
in a box.  The box can be 1.5” thick and
12” x 12” in size or a 12” pizza box!

<div><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We thought it would it awesome to be able to take our favorite photos &amp; turn them into something that can make gifts even more personal - something unique you can give to others that represents your relationship with them. With the holidays right around the corner, the idea of gift wrap using Instagram* photos was born. Using specialty wide-format printers &amp; high-quality paper in San Francisco, we want to bring the idea to you.  We've called it PicPaperie!</span></div>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">At the end of the project, we will provide a simple mobile app and website for you to select your Instagram* photo (using the Instagram* API) and a pattern for your gift wrap.</span></p>
<p>We will print your gift wrap in San Francisco, California and deliver it your home or office.  (Note: shipping is included in the United States but shipping fees are additional internationally).</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will offer approximately 2"" and 4"" sized photos in staggered tile and straight rows &amp; columns.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In the future we will consider more patterns as well as other ways to add your photos from other services.</span></p>
<p><b>Will I receive the gift wrap before the holidays?</b></p>
<p>Hanukkah starts November 27th and Christmas is December 25th. We're committed to ship early bird awards before November 27th and all other Indiegogo orders before December 18th.</p>
<p><b>How and where will you print the gift wrap?</b></p>

--------------------------------------------
The Indiegogo campaign has ended.Visit www.picpaperie.com to learn more.
--------------------------------------------
We thought it would it awesome to be able to take our favorite photos & turn them into something that can make gifts even more personal - something unique you can give to others that represents your relationship with them. With the holidays right around the corner, the idea of gift wrap using Instagram* photos was born. Using specialty wide-format printers & high-quality paper in San Francisco, we want to bring the idea to you.  We've called it PicPaperie!



At the end of the project, we will provide a simple mobile app and website for you to select your Instagram* photo (using the Instagram* API) and a pattern for your gift wrap.
We will print your gift wrap in San Francisco, California and deliver it your home or office.  (Note: shipping is included in the United States but shipping fees are additional internationally).

We will offer approximately 2"" and 4"" sized photos in staggered tile and straight rows & columns.  In the future we will consider more patterns as well as other ways to add your photos from other services.
Will I receive the gift wrap before the holidays?
Hanukkah starts November 27th and Christmas is December 25th. We're committed to ship early bird awards before November 27th and all other Indiegogo orders before December 18th.
How and where will you print the gift wrap?
All printing will occur in the San Francisco Bay area. We will be using advanced generation high speed professional ink-jet printers on high quality acid-free ink-jet paper to produce high quality prints.

<p>My name is <a href=""https://twitter.com/Paul_Reviews"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paul Moore</a>.  I'm an Information Security Consultant &amp; Founder of Privacy Protocol.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, I received a late night call from Per Thorsheim; a #password &amp; #security expert and Founder of <a href=""https://passwordscon.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#passwordsCon</a>.</p>
<p>His request was simple... break behavioral biometrics!</p>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613747492/rd2lcpnhzx4jwo5tabuo.png"" src=""""/>What is behavioral biometrics?</h3>
<p>Behavioral biometrics (aka keystroke dynamics) is a technique used by a growing number of firms to identify you by <i><u>how</u> </i>you type.</p>
<p>The concept is nothing new, however the underlying technology has evolved such that it's now possible to identify a person's gender within 10 key presses... and their exact identity shortly after.</p>
<p>It's an immensely powerful tool in the right hands &amp; represents a huge leap forwards in terms of security, even replacing passwords in some instances.  Take RBS/Natwest for example, who <a href=""https://www.rbs.com/rbs/news/2020/06/behavioural-biometrics-set-to-replace-bank-passwords.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">recently announced</a> their adoption of behavioral biometrics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whilst it measurably increases security, it has a potentially devastating impact upon privacy.</p>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613747492/rd2lcpnhzx4jwo5tabuo.png"" src=""""/>Where is it used?</h3>
<p>As behavioral biometrics becomes more accessible &amp; effective, the number of sites adopting it has risen considerably.</p>
<p>Some firms are open &amp; transparent about its use, whilst others attempt to hide it or fail to explain fully the implications upon you, in the event your profile is stolen/cloned.</p>
<p>Over the last 5 years, we've seen a number of banks &amp; financial institutions across the globe adopt this technique.  If you've ever come across a site/bank which doesn't allow you to paste passwords, they may well be using keystroke dynamics to identify you.</p>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613747492/rd2lcpnhzx4jwo5tabuo.png"" src=""""/>The proof of concept...</h3>
<p>After a few hours, we'd developed a <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyboard-privacy/aoeboeflhhnobfjkafamelopfeojdohk?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">proof-of-concept Chrome extension</a> which is still used by over 3000 people today.</p>
<p>To test the application, we used <a href=""https://www.behaviosec.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BehavioSec </a>and <a href=""https://www.keytrac.net/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KeyTrac</a>; both of which produce behavioral biometric software used across the globe.</p>
<p>Without keyboardPrivacy, <a href=""https://www.keytrac.net/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">keyTrac</a> were able to identify me with 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>Following the publication in 2015, keyboardPrivacy hit the news... as we demonstrated the technology could be used to identify anyone, even if they went to great lengths to hide their identity.</p>
<p>One publication on Arstechnica, entitled ""<a href=""https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/how-the-way-you-type-can-shatter-anonymity-even-on-tor/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">How the way you type can shatter anonymity, even on Tor</a>"", featured Runa Sandvik; a former Tor developer.</p>
<p>During her tests, she was identified with 100% accuracy with a completely unmodified installation of Tor.  With keyboardPrivacy enabled, she too dropped to 0% - meaning in effect, the site was 100% sure it wasn't her.</p>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613747492/rd2lcpnhzx4jwo5tabuo.png"" src=""""/>Can't I just use the Chrome plugin instead?</h3>

</div></div>","Background
My name is Paul Moore.  I'm an Information Security Consultant & Founder of Privacy Protocol.
Back in 2015, I received a late night call from Per Thorsheim; a #password & #security expert and Founder of #passwordsCon.
His request was simple... break behavioral biometrics!

What is behavioral biometrics?
Behavioral biometrics (aka keystroke dynamics) is a technique used by a growing number of firms to identify you by how you type.
The concept is nothing new, however the underlying technology has evolved such that it's now possible to identify a person's gender within 10 key presses... and their exact identity shortly after.
It's an immensely powerful tool in the right hands & represents a huge leap forwards in terms of security, even replacing passwords in some instances.  Take RBS/Natwest for example, who recently announced their adoption of behavioral biometrics.
Unfortunately, whilst it measurably increases security, it has a potentially devastating impact upon privacy.

Where is it used?
As behavioral biometrics becomes more accessible & effective, the number of sites adopting it has risen considerably.
Some firms are open & transparent about its use, whilst others attempt to hide it or fail to explain fully the implications upon you, in the event your profile is stolen/cloned.
Over the last 5 years, we've seen a number of banks & financial institutions across the globe adopt this technique.  If you've ever come across a site/bank which doesn't allow you to paste passwords, they may well be using keystroke dynamics to identify you.

The proof of concept...
After a few hours, we'd developed a proof-of-concept Chrome extension which is still used by over 3000 people today.
To test the application, we used BehavioSec and KeyTrac; both of which produce behavioral biometric software used across the globe.
Without keyboardPrivacy, keyTrac were able to identify me with 100% accuracy.

With keyboardPrivacy...

BehavioSec too produced the same result - from near-certainty to literally no idea who I was... simply by installing keyboardPrivacy.

keyboardPrivacy: 5 years later...

A USB pass-thru device which defeats behavioral biometrics.  No installation, no drivers... just place in-line with your keyboard.

I use a VPN/Tor/Proxy.  Is this still possible?
Following the publication in 2015, keyboardPrivacy hit the news... as we demonstrated the technology could be used to identify anyone, even if they went to great lengths to hide their identity.
One publication on Arstechnica, entitled ""How the way you type can shatter anonymity, even on Tor"", featured Runa Sandvik; a former Tor developer.
During her tests, she was identified with 100% accuracy with a completely unmodified installation of Tor.  With keyboardPrivacy enabled, she too dropped to 0% - meaning in effect, the site was 100% sure it wasn't her.

Can't I just use the Chrome plugin instead?
Absolutely!  We appreciate a hardware version may not be suitable for everyone, however there are a number of concerns which we've addressed in hardware which aren't possible via an extension.
1)  The plugin can be detected.It's possible for sites to detect the keyboardPrivacy plugin and if inclined, may be able to bypass it or render it useless.  I have no knowledge of this actually happening, but it's important to understand that's it's possible.  This isn't possible however, with the hardware version.
2)  The plugin can cause latency with some sites.The plugin was a proof-of-concept and only intended to demonstrate that it's possible to protect your privacy & defeat behavioural biometrics.  However, a number of users have reported minor performance issues & noticeable delays with their text input.  This isn't possible with the hardware version.


What We Need
We need to further refine our firmware and place a minimum order of 5000 units to make production viable.
Although the firmware is fully functional and meets our expectations with regards to performance/operation, it's equally important to ensure it works with a many keyboards as possible without limiting their functionality.  For example, keyboards with USB hubs, screens and other HID devices do not present themselves to the operating system in a similar manner than a plain keyboard - our firmware needs to be refined to handle such cases.


Risks & Challenges
As with any campaign, there are risks & inevitable hurdles along the way.
However, I believe I've taken all reasonable steps to ensure the development goes smoothly.
I've enlisted the technical expertise of Russ Nelson @ Trango Engineering based in Colorado, USA.  Since 2012, Trango Engineering has led the development of electronic products across several fields including security, medical & environmental; leveraging decades of combined experience in prototyping, PCB & firmware design, FPGA and embedded systems.

<h3><strong>PROJECT HISTORY</strong></h3>
<p>Hi! Michelle here with our back story: Shadow Rack began two years ago when I came home to a stunning surprise. Joe had designed a new organization system for my potted eye shadows. Before Shadow Racks I would glue magnets to the back of each shadow and stick them on a large stainless steel board, which was too big to fit anywhere in my bathroom, not enough wall space, so it was just leaning between the wall and my sink. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568302717/foifvrz2qxziphvgicaz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>My first rack set!</i><br/> </p>
<p>When I came home to see all of my eye shadows neatly tucked in a grid along the side of my bathroom mirror, I was blown away and had to share them online. My sister posted a picture to a Facebook group and the response was wild, but I already knew we had something special.</p>
<p>Here are some reviews from our prototype testing:<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568302778/x6rv4yuwvzlfumxverpr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>We stopped selling prototypes and closed up shop to focus exclusively on our Kickstarter campaign and perfecting every aspect of the new design. </p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>WHY DO WE CARE?</strong>
</h3>
<p>The ultimate goal of makeup storage is to be able to see the things that you have, so you can have fun with the new and shiny stuff, but also be reminded to dip into older favorites and get the most out of your investment. In acrylic organizers and drawers it’s still easy for things to go mentally missing (out of sight out of mind). That’s why we created Shadow Rack organizers, that can utilize wall space to beautifully display makeup collections.</p>
<p><strong>Why Crowdfunding: </strong>As firm advocates of a free market, we love and support crowdfunding because it's a direct line to the demands of the people. No big suits or red tape - the future of Shadow Racks is in your hands. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568302874/gvmksonwcbvdzb7eotm7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Since
December, 2013 Jalousier has been a registered Limited Liability Company based
in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Our family
team managed to get to this point where you find us now. We already got your
attention and are ready to provide a finished product ready to go into
production, not a DIY concept. </p>
<h1>Where did the idea come
from?</h1>
<p>The idea came quite naturally. After living in a sunny apartment, we noticed
there are many benefits to having an apartment with several windows. By relying
on the Sun's rays to warm our apartment, we reduced our dependency on electric
heat. Using the sun's natural light
meant that we didn't need to use our switch lights as often. We were saving energy and money, but we were
spending a great deal of time adjusting the 12 windows with 12 venetian blinds
several times a day. It was a real
hassle, so we took to the Internet to find a product to meet our needs. We learned that no such product existed...
yet. That's when we realized there is a
smart solution to our problem. And the Jalousier was born. </p><h1></h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/362200/files/20140210191555-4.jpg?1392088555"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1>Shoutouts</h1>

It improves fish health with the root oxygenation, biologically filters the tank by growing plants above and below the water. Growing roots down into the water allows the plants to soak up nutrients directly, creating a self-cleaning aquarium that doesn't need to be cleaned as often as a regular fish tank and relies less on pumps and filters.</span>

Installing the module as a vertical garden allows to 'zone' your tank and aquascape it - a design method that brings new creative options, artistry, and ecosystem health to your aquarium.</span></p></div>

<p>After being involved with the worlds largest aquaponics system, we wanted to do something different, bring this technology to the home and school scale to provide a fun and educational experience for the community and especially kids who don't have access to a garden. So we miniaturised it down into a DIY Aquaponics Kit that can convert any aquarium into an aquaponic garden or a vertical garden inside the aquarium. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The best thing about it its natural!  Nutrients from fish waste cause algae to grow and the water turns green. The Aquarium Garden solves this problem with its AquaBiofilter™ inside, the plants take up excess nutrients, preventing algae from excessive growth. AquaBiofilter™ is specially treated biofilter material that enhances plant growth by supporting a complex bio-colony that helps pull soluble nutrients out of the water and deliver them to the plant roots. The Aquarium Garden can reduce cleaning by up to 50% which makes a big reduction in cleaning your aquarium - sure to please everyone in the house or school! It doesn't require soil, and there are no chemical fertilizers or herbicides its a completely biological filtering ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The plants are growing in our unique AquaBiofilter™ media and all the fertiliser and nutrients are coming from the fish being upcycled into the plant growth and biofilm inside the AquaBiofilter™. If you add a water snail it will also help dramatically reduce algae overgrowth, and the biofilter ecosystem creates a self-cleaning tank, where plants are being fertilized by the fish and plants are always being watered. So no more dead plants in your house with the Aquarium Garden!</span></p>

<h3>The Social Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that kids should have access to learning opportunities about the environment and how it works from an early age. We want to create a social movement that develops eco-literacy in schools, in the home and anywhere an Aquarium can be found like apartments where there is no space for gardens. Its more important now than ever that kids learn about how nature works, how nutrients get cycled and how to create living ecosystems and grow food. The Aquarium Garden DIY Aquaponics Kit makes this all possible! Help share this campaign with friends and family who you know will love the Aquarium Garden.</p>

<h3><b>FAQ</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span><b>How does it work?</b></span><br/>The Aquarium Garden DIY Aquaponics Kit enables you to turn any aquarium into a self cleaning eco system. Fish waste and all the wastewater gets up cycled and fertilises the plants. The AquaBiofilter™ vastly increases the biofiltration capacity of the tank.</p>
<p><b>What parts do I get?</b><br/>The Aquarium Garden DIY Aquaponics Kit is an assembly of several parts, including the Case, Aqua Biofilter growing material, 2 hooks and 2 suction caps. The hooks allow you to grow the Aquarium Garden plants and herbs aquaponically above the water, and the suction caps enable you to also grow aquaponically or grow aquatic aquarium plants as a vertical garden down in the tank at any level, growing the same plants you would normally plant in the stones at the bottom of the tank. This is a world first, a vertical garden inside aquariums - with the roots growing exposed in the aquarium taking up soluble nutrients and growing faster. Roots that are growing exposed in the water either aquaponically or as a vertical garden can access soluble nutrients better than plant leaves and this can contribute to less algae growth and less cleaning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464025195/Aquarium_Garden_Product_Overview_oicbig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>What is the size of the Aquarium Garden?</b><br/>The outer dimensions of the Case are approximately 155Lx55Hx45Wmm. The hooks internal dimensions are 10mm / 0.39 inches wide allowing it to hook onto large aquarium walls. This wide hook internal dimensions also allows the Aquarium Garden plants to grow leaves and branches in all directions including backwards - growing freely without pushing up against the glass. If you prefer a more upright look and not leaning forward slightly, we suggest you use the suction caps instead which fit tightly up against the aquarium wall. The hook  design also means that if you have very thick aquarium walls you can use the hooks and easily move the planter case in and out easily without having to disconnect any suction caps. We recommend not to leave your suction caps in direct sunlight, which means facing the case forward towards the sunlight. </p>
<p><b>Do I need a grow light (traditional or LED) for the Aquarium Garden inside?</b><br/>If you have access to sunlight its a good way to get started without investing in an LED grow light. If you live in a climate without a lot of sunshine or in an apartment without direct sunlight, we suggest getting an LED grow light available at your local aquarium supplies shop or online. </p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">What fish can I use with the Aquarium Garden?</b></p>
<p>The Aquarium Garden DIY Aquaponics Kit can be used with all kinds of fish. We have great experience with Betta fish also known as Siamese Fighting Fish because they love living in the plant roots and are very appreciative of the habitat to live and even sleep in the roots. Suitable fish also include goldfish and breeds that have goldfish origins, many tropical and sub-tropical fish love it. For aquariums in cold climates where heaters are used its recommended to get advice from your local fish and pet store.</p>
<p><b>What size aquarium can I use?</b><br/>The DIY Aquaponics Kit means you can choose any size and style of tank. The best is to have at least one straight wall where you can use the suction caps or hooks to hang the Aquarium Garden DIY Aquaponics Kit into your fish tank! The bigger your tank, the more Aquarium Gardens you can put in!</p>
<p><b>What about the previous design?</b><br/>We did a lot of prototyping to develop a great product. The new Aquarium Garden DIY Aquaponics Kit is converts any aquarium into an aquaponics garden and vertical garden below the water. If you liked the old Aquaponics Garden design - we suggest you buy a 10 gallon aquarium at your local pet store and install the Aquarium Garden Kit inside. It is the most cost effective way to create your own ecosystem at home! The previous design we developed was going to cost $79, but we thought we could do better. We listened to the community of aquarium enthusiasts and that the previous tank was small, so we wanted to do something better. So we focused on just the essentials of an aquaponics garden - and developed something that can convert any tank into an aquarium garden. If for example you purchase a 10 gallon tank at Wal-Mart for $14, and buy our kit at $20 regular price, your total price is $34. Compared to our previous design at $79 - we are offering a better price and a better product that offers more flexibility. There is no product on the market that enables you to grow plants aquaponically, and also grow aquarium plants in a vertical garden at any level in the tank. Not only are there no other products out there like this, but at $20 its great value.</p>
<p><b>What fish feed should I use?</b><br/>We recommend you to use organic fish feed in order to avoid harmful substances entering your aquarium. Many types of fish feed contain heavy metals or other harmful substances for your fish and yourself. Check with your pet store if they source their fish feed from sustainable sources.</p>
<p><b>Can I eat the plants if they grow under water?</b><br/>It is not recommended to eat plants that have been exposed to the water itself. Only the roots of the edible plants should be in the water. We advise to wash and thoroughly cook all plants if you’re going to eat them.</p>
<p><b>What is the health effect of aquaponics on my aquarium?</b><br/>The solution to improving the health of aquariums is to put aquaponics plants into the water with the roots dangling down into the nutrient rich water so that it can filter out the soluble nutrients directly, feeding rapid plant growth and biologically cleaning the tank and reducing algal overgrowth. After testing 10 different prototypes we found our Betta fish lived a longer than normal life span - we believe because our Aquarium Garden was mimicking it's nautral habitat of floating aquatic plants that it evolved with in South East Asia. Floating plant roots provide safe and secure haven from bird predators and also a place to sleep and spawn. When we grew basil, the fish particularly liked those roots so we like to use basil wherever we can. The micro-doses of essential oils that are exuded from the basil plant roots may help the fish fight disease and parasites. We recommend thoroughly cleaning the roots of plants or seeds before planting to remove soil particles for the health of fish is they are stressed from being moved. Salt baths can be used to treat fish that have health issues - but please get advice from your local fish health specialist.</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Why are basil, mint corander /cilantro good plants to grow in the Aquarium Garden? </b></p>
<p>Basil, mint and coriander / cilantro have  essential oils that exude out the roots in very micro amounts. These exudates are complex essential oils and carried by enzyme chains that slowly move out of the root and down the rootlet branches and into the water. The fish may be able to benefit from these in fighting disease and parasites.</p>
<p><b>Can you provide some more information about the Betta Fish?</b><br/>Fish such as Betta fish, also known as Siamese Fighting Fish love swimming into the roots for protection from predators as an evolutionary adaption to hide from water birds, and also enjoy sleeping in the roots as a protective barrier from predator fish. The roots of the basil, coriander and mint that the fish spend so much time, end up rubbing off a significant amount of micro-doses of essential oils and enzymes onto the fish scales and gills, protecting the fish against helminth parasites that can come from contaminated fish feed, or in plant soil.</p>
<p><b>How can the Aquarium Garden reduce the likelihood of algae blooms?</b><br/>When dissolved oxygen levels get low, for example when excess nutrients are not biologically filtered out of the water, then algae can bloom or grow out of control to level that pushes algae into dominance. The Aquarium Garden biologically cleans the aquarium and there reduces the likelihood of algae blooms.</p>
<p><b>How is it possible to manufacture and ship at such a low price?</b><br/>After years of product development we have learnt much about manufacturing and shipping products. Also, we are on a mission to educate kids and people all around the world about the complexity of nature, that’s why we are making it available at such a low price. Eco-literacy starts with kids learning about nature in the home or school, and we believe that bringing a DIY 'maker' approach to environment is what we need to bring into our schools, if we want our future generations to truly understand how nature works with its cycles, feedback loops and complexity.</p>

What is the Aquarium Garden DIY Aquaponics Kit?
The Kit converts any aquarium into a garden, growing plants, herbs and greens aquaponically. A world first - the Aquarium Garden module is also a vertical garden that creates aquatic plant habitats at multiple levels in the aquarium like a coral reef! You will love the plants growing in your aquarium, the water being biologically cleaned and a healthy ecosystem for your fish with much less tank cleaning. 


The Aquarium Garden uses our unique AquaBiofilter™ technology and will fit into nearly any tank and provide three grow plugs per garden module, just add seeds or seedlings and your tank will start growing plants! The Aquarium Garden is a DIY Aquaponics Kit that can create a beautiful lush ecosystem in just a matter of minutes. It improves fish health with the root oxygenation, biologically filters the tank by growing plants above and below the water. Growing roots down into the water allows the plants to soak up nutrients directly, creating a self-cleaning aquarium that doesn't need to be cleaned as often as a regular fish tank and relies less on pumps and filters.

It comes with suction caps and hooks so you can choose to 'hack' your aquarium and grow plants aquaponically on top, or grow aquatic plants at different levels down in the fish tank. Installing the module as a vertical garden allows to 'zone' your tank and aquascape it - a design method that brings new creative options, artistry, and ecosystem health to your aquarium.

</ul></div>","Hi!
Thanks for stopping by! Loochi did not reach its funding goal but the project lives on! Check out www.tbideas.com for news on this and other open-source projects.
And if you would like to know more about this specific crowdfunding campaign, you can read our post-mortem on our blog.
thomas - january 2013
 

Decorate your room with colors, play beautiful animations and control your light in rhythm with your music! Loochi is controlled through our app on your iPhone or iPad.
And thanks to the new Bluetooth 4.0, Loochi is really easy to use: just plug it in and start using it, there is zero configuration.

Loochi is way more than a lamp:

Turn the light on and off in white (warm or cold white)
Choose any color on the color wheel
Use one of the nature effects to get a nice and slow animation (ambiance) of fire, jungle, lava, water, etc
Create and share your own animations (timed sequence of colors and transitions) with the included animation editor
Download animations created by other users of Loochi!
Throwing a party? Loochi can listen to the music and automatically generate rhythmic light effects (just like a Light Organ).

And because it is opensource - you can write your own applications to control Loochi!

Loochi reacts to events on your phone such as incoming text messages, facebook updates, phone calls, alarm clock and more depending on your platform and installed applications.

Put Loochi on your night stand to wake up gently to a sunrise animation, or put it on your office desk to show you when your phone is ringing.

 

Loochi is completely open-source: hardware, software and design wise. All of the source files are already available today under the Creative Commons Share-Alike with Attribution version 3.0 license. You can find more documentation on our blog and we will keep on posting in the coming weeks.

Looking for some more ideas on how you can use Loochi? Try these:

Create your own color animations and share them with the world,
Write new event applications for your mobile,
Design your own shade for the lamp and 3D-print it,
Build your own mobile phone controlled lamp from scratch,
Increase the power, change the types of LED, etc!

The LED is a 10 W RGB chip from Ledengin. It produces 510 Lumen, more than the amount of light produced by a 40W incandescent light bulb!
The shade is 150 mm diameter (approximately 6 inches) and the complete lamp is 184 mm high (~7.2 inches). We are still deciding on the exact size (120-170mm) and the material (Plexyglas or Glass).
The base, designed by Dr Jürgen Kienhofer under a CC-BY-SA license is made of plastic with a Chrome plating: a nice shiny, mirror like look. A heatsink made out of extruded aluminium and carefully placed vents help keep the LED cool.
The wireless link uses Bluetooth® 4.0 to communicate with your smartphone or tablet and can go up to a 100 feet.
The button-switch on the base allows you to turn Loochi on and off when your phone is not around.

Why did you choose Bluetooth 4.0 and not Wifi like so many other lamp projects? We think the biggest barrier to the adoption of smart objects is the complexity involved in setting them up. Bluetooth 4.0 requires absolutely no configuration.

So does that mean that my neighbor will be able to control my Loochi? Absolutely not, Loochi automatically pairs to your phone.

How do I pair Loochi to another device? A long press on Loochi's button allows you to pair it with more devices.

Can I have a Loochi for Christmas? We cannot ship one to you in time for christmas but you can definitely build your own and have it for christmas! Read the blog and contact us if you need help!

customs, or additional costs associated with your country. Also, there 
is no guarantee that Zstat will work in your country (outside of US) such as unknown power 
&amp; connectivity issues. If it 
turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will 
reimburse your order.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><b>When is the soonest I can get Zstat in my home or building?</b></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Estimated shipping date for Zstat is August 2014.

The WiFi module in our Indiegogo units is however subject to change.</p><p><b>Will Zstat work on low voltage systems?</b></p><p>Yes Zstat will work on low voltage systems. Zstat draws much less power then alternative Internet connected thermostats.</p><p><b>What happens if it runs low on battery power?<br/></b></p><p>Zstat will automatically go into a low power mode and indicate that it is running low on power by flashing red light and will send you emails and text messages.</p><p>
<b>How does it create an automatic schedule? What phones does autoschedule work with?</b><br/></p><p>It connects to your Iphone with a low power Bluetooth connection.

Zstat will only be accessible by you and those on your shared access list. You will never be required to have a 3rd party account in order to use our app/control your Zstat (Google account, Google+, Facebook account etc.). You as the user will have full control on how all of the data generated by Zstat is stored and processed. We will also feature a private mode for your account, when enabled absolutely no data is stored (only data stored is data used for you to remotely control Zstat with our app), the only drawback to private mode is the data can be used to help you save energy, create an automatic schedule and for energy analytics and reporting; so those features will not be available in private mode. We use bank level security and all communication between Zstat and the Zstat app is encrypted over SSL (HTTPS) and any data stored will be encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption. You as the user will have full control over privacy and decide how the data is stored over time.</p><p></p><p><b>What are the challenges?<br/></b></p>
Funds raised from this campaign will be used primarily to cover up front
manufacturing costs and the price/cost will decrease with time and scale. All mass
scale early production efforts have the potential for delays and setbacks
including supplier, manufacturing and part sourcing issues. Delays are possible
however we are working with industry experts to ensure a smooth initial
manufacturing run.<br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>Will there be an SDK or API?</b></p><p>We do not have plans for an
 SDK. We do have plans to implement an API and hope to 
make it available when we ship in August.</p><p><br/></p><p>If you have any more questions ask away! You can also reach us at <a href=""mailto:team@zstat.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">team@zstat.us</a> we will do our best to respond back asap.</p><p>We hope you join us. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

Over 50% of a home and buildings total energy
usage is the result of a thermostat calling for heat or cool
Over 89% of all thermostats in the US have no
schedule and/or internet connectivity, out of 225 million thermostats in the
US
Setting your thermostat on a schedule can save
15% off a home or buildings energy bill, saving $10-$40 per month or $40-400 a year depending on usage

reimburse your order.When is the soonest I can get Zstat in my home or building?Estimated shipping date for Zstat is August 2014. Our goal is to get Zstat in your hands sooner (July) but we don't want to over promise. We are working around the clock and as soon as it is ready it will be sent to you!What kind of WiFi module are you using?We are currently using a TI CC3000 (Texas Instruments) WiFi module. The WiFi module in our Indiegogo units is however subject to change.Will Zstat work on low voltage systems?Yes Zstat will work on low voltage systems.

You as the user will have full control on how all of the data generated by Zstat is stored and processed. We will also feature a private mode for your account, when enabled absolutely no data is stored (only data stored is data used for you to remotely control Zstat with our app), the only drawback to private mode is the data can be used to help you save energy, create an automatic schedule and for energy analytics and reporting; so those features will not be available in private mode. We use bank level security and all communication between Zstat and the Zstat app is encrypted over SSL (HTTPS) and any data stored will be encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption. You as the user will have full control over privacy and decide how the data is stored over time.What are the challenges?
Funds raised from this campaign will be used primarily to cover up front
manufacturing costs and the price/cost will decrease with time and scale. All mass
scale early production efforts have the potential for delays and setbacks
including supplier, manufacturing and part sourcing issues. Delays are possible
however we are working with industry experts to ensure a smooth initial
manufacturing run.Will there be an SDK or API?We do not have plans for an
 SDK. We do have plans to implement an API and hope to 
make it available when we ship in August.If you have any more questions ask away! You can also reach us at team@zstat.us we will do our best to respond back asap.We hope you join us.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div></div>","Meet Countdown! The international award-winning toy that completely re-imagines the classic playground game of hide & seek. It encourages kids and families to get up, move around, play together and have fun!   Straight out of the box Countdown comes loaded with 4 different active and social play modes, like Hide & Seek and Hot Potato, and each mode incorporates over 12 different retro inspired gaming puzzles to beat to win. The difficulty is adjustable so every player in the family can take a turn.What's even better? Countdown is fully upgradeable, meaning that new puzzles, modes, sounds and graphics will be released regularly to keep play fresh!    Most tech interactions for kids today are solitary and sedentary. Tablet and phone use is on the rise and  kids are not playing together or outside nearly enough. Pressure Games saw an opportunity to make a tech toy with a new perspective, where tech was a tool of the play - but not the total focus. Active and social play was the star of playtime and got friends and families having fun together. Countdown was designed as an indoor or outdoor toy and will make your kids move!   How do you beat the game in each mode? Easy! Set a timer to play and then work your way through retro inspired puzzles, challenging everyone's reflexes, sensory skills and cognitive ability.With a classic game of hide & seek, the game is over when the other player is found. With the hide and seek toy Countdown, that's just when a new challenge starts! Whatever time remains on the clock is how long you have to beat the puzzles and win. But don’t make any mistakes, or the timer speeds up. Countdown is versatile. It's small, light and durable - making it easy to play around the house, bring along for road trips or a day at the park. These are the ways you can play:Hide. Seek. Play. The mode that launched Countdown. Set a timer, hide it and have your friends go find it. Once found, the excitement is not over yet. Play through the puzzles to stop the timer.With the use of a timer and games to stop the clock, Countdown takes the traditional hide and seek game to the next level.  Each player must play a random puzzle and pass to the next. Whoever is holding Countdown when the timer expires is out! Can you be the last player standing?Grab some friends, set a timer and see if you can work together through a random onslaught of puzzles to win! Hone your skill in each of the 12 mini-games. Go for your best time or just pass the time.These bite size mini-games bring some magic with bright shining lights, crisp engaging audio, and motion detection for all different kinds of puzzle play fun. Countdown includes some classics like Whack-a-Mole and Trigger Finger and new games like Color Wheel and Tie the Bell. The difficulty level is what sets Countdown apart and lets you even the playing field between players. It's how a toddler can play with an adult or a 6 year old take on a 12 year old... and win! Take Trigger Finger above where you have to hit a button when the lights are green. Make a mistake, and the timer speeds up! 
 Level 1 - No puzzles. Just simple hide & seek. Great for toddlers!
 Level 2 - Puzzles are slow paced. Great for the really young.
 Levels 3-8 - Gradually increasing speed. 
 Level 9 - There's just 0.35 seconds to hit on green! Only for the twitchiest game players (and darn hard to video)
                          This little device packs an impressive tech punch. Take a peek under the hood at some of the latest technology and fine tuned design this toy uses for ultimate family fun.   Size matters! One of our primary development focuses with Countdown was to create the smallest toy with the highest tech. Smaller size means more hiding spots and easier to hold by all ages of hands. It's an excellent for group and social toy.Over 1.5 years of development, we've managed to decrease the size of Countdown by almost 40% while adding a graphic display, motion detection and high-quality audio.Toys can evolve too! We're so used to apps on our phone or video games receiving regular updates. We thought to ourselves, why not toys? From personal experience, we saw plenty of toys enter our homes to get a few days (if we were lucky) of play and then quickly start gathering dust. That's why we want to change things with Countdown by adding easy updates. Simply plug into your computer with USB and get new play modes, puzzles, sound packs and more. We have plenty of updates already planned, but your feedback will be key helping us design where Countdown will grow.  Countdown's first iteration was literally an Arduino development kit carried around in a Tupperware container. We've come a long ways since then :)Our first prototypes were designed to lay flat. The idea was that they would be even easier to hide. While true, it proved to also be exceptionally boring looking.As we took a constant stream of feedback from testers, we iterated to the current design we have now. It looks sleek and kids just want to pick it up to know what it is. It fits in the smallest of hands just as easily as adult hands. It's bright, loud, and, frankly, awesome! Countdown was accepted into the Arrow Certification Program in 2018 and awarded the Arrow Certified Technology badge verifying the design was feasible for manufacturing. This was an early step for us to ensure we weren't impractical with what we were trying to do.On February 2nd, 2019, we filed a provisional patent application covering the game-flow mechanics of Countdown. This is a utility patent covering the game mechanics of a hide & seek toy. If approved, it will provide 20 years of protection for any toy in a similar vein. We've taken thousands of pictures since this project began, but the ones below all held a special place in our minds as a big milestone in some way or another along the development path. Countdown will be launching under our active toy brand, Duck Duck Cat. Originally designed under Pressure Games, we realized we have a ton of toy ideas and wanted to make sure our brand fits with each toy we create. We are very lucky to be working with some of the best in the industry as we develop and launch our first toy. Our partners have helped guide Countdown to be the best toy possible. On our advisory board is Val Vacante, an expert in the toy industry and and founder of Collabsco, a strategy and innovation firm based in Austin, Texas. In a connected world of entertainment, play, living and learning Valerie has pioneered award winning digital products and experiences across IoT, AR, VR, voice, robotics and beyond.We have also partnered with veteran toy firm Design Edge for manufacturing, a veteran in the industry of toy design and production. For over 30 years, Design Edge has been a leading design, development and sourcing agency across several industries including toys, games, gifts, food and beverages, and housewares to hardware.Pressure Games has a mission to bring healthy play to all children. We are a Public Benefit Corporation, aspiring B Corporation, and members of Pledge One Percent and founders of the SouthWest Florida chapter of Florida for Good. We currently hold play sessions with area chapters of the Boys and Girls Clubs and local elementary schools.  Getting starting in the manufacturing process can be one of the biggest hurdles for small start ups with a new product. Our team has past production experience and we've partnered with a premiere toy manufacturer to get the job done.We currently have a manufacturer-created prototype which has been used to work out the kinks in transition from 3D printed part to injection molded product.The tooling process (the extremely expensive endeavor of making metal casting plates that can stamp out our case rapidly) was kicked off in late July. Once these tools are finished (estimated for early September), the full manufacturing run will begin. Due to the enormous effort we've put into design for manufacturing every step of the way, our manufacturer's experience and simplicity of our design, we're expecting full manufacturing to start in early September with units delivered to our warehouse in early November. Alex Andreae - CEO & Founder Alex founded Pressure Games in 2018 after coming up with the idea for Countdown. With 3 kids of his own, ages 3-8 at the time (5-10 now), he immediately knew the idea of toys that encouraged active play could really take off. So much screen time and kids not actually socializing is a problem. Pressure Games seeks solutions.Before Countdown, Alex worked for a startup making a GPS connected pet collar company, Nuzzle, as Chief Technology Officer from 2014-2018, founded SourceCoast Web Development in 2008 to create social network integration products for websites and Advanced Micro Devices for from 1999 to 2008 as an electrical engineer.He's a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin (MS of Computer Engineering) and Georgia Tech (BS of Electrical Engineering)Elizabeth Hughes - CBO Liz graduated from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. She joined Nuzzle in 2016 as the mobile app designer. Shortly after Pressure Games had a concept and plan, Alex approached her to overhaul the look of Countdown and setup our company's overall branding. Nilesh Kulkarni - Lead Firmware Architect Nilesh was hired by Alex at Nuzzle as a firmware engineer. He quickly gained respect by optimizing code and reducing power consumption significantly and was the first choice to lead development of Countdown at Pressure Games.He's a graduate of the University of Texas at Arlington. We’ve covered a lot of ground on the road to launch our first product, here is what we have accomplished and some upcoming milestones. We can't wait for COVID-19 to be over so we can attend more fantastic toy and comic conventions. Below are some of the events we were able to attend in the before-times to demo Countdown and meet some awesome people!",62.0,0,"2 Campaigns

on the real, all-in, cost of homes in order to make them truly affordable. With
no energy bills, owners can accelerate their mortgage for a savings of
$400,000, or more, over 30 years. A home like this can reshape your lifestyle
and your future, opening up a world of opportunity!</p>

<h5>WHEN CAN I BUY AN
ACRE HOME?</h5>
<p>After completion of the Axiom House prototype in Summer 2016, we
will be offering our homes to the Kansas City market.  We are currently
taking deposits for our customer presale list in the Kansas City area. Early
adopters will help define the final designs, and secure a place in line with
our approved Acre Builders.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h5>CAN I GET AN
ACRE HOME OUTSIDE OF KANSAS CITY?</h5>
<p>In 2017 we will begin to establish builder relationships and a
customer pre-sale list in other cities. If you would like to bring our homes to
your area, please support our campaign – and rally friends, neighbors and
coworkers to do the same!  We will use
donations to evaluate interest in other markets.  This is the way
GoogleFiber rolled out in Kansas City, and it was thrilling to watch
neighborhoods come alive to compete for access to a new idea and product!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h5>HOW MUCH WILL AN
ACRE HOME COST?</h5>
<p>Our homes are priced competitively with traditional new home
builds. In Kansas City, this runs about $110 to $135 per square foot. This is
independent of land costs.</p>
<p>That price includes the entire package, from materials, labor
and transport to appliances and solar panels.  It even includes standard
site work and slab-on-grade foundation, though homeowners can elect to build a
basement. The only extras are premium add-ons like advanced home technology.</p>
<p>Our finish and fixture options are offered as Standard, Premium
or Luxury packages that allow homeowners to control costs while enjoying access
to higher grade materials.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h5>HOW ARE ACRE HOMES
SO AFFORDABLE?</h5>
<p>It’s not any one thing, but a combination of strategies, that
allows us to achieve this. A few examples:</p>
<p>By offering fixed plans, we can build hours of engineering and
design into the base cost of the home. Just like with your car or phone,
focused<i><span>product development</span></i>helps
us deliver a refined, high-performance home that can be repeated again and
again.</p>
<p>Starting with a right-sized, efficient floor plan has a domino
effect: reducing up-front costs, energy demands and system sizes throughout the
house.  With a lighter load, we can eliminate ductwork, wiring, plumbing
runs, and the expensive labor associated with these.  With streamlined,
repeatable construction, we shave months of labor costs out of each job.</p>
<p>Our scalable business model helps us keep a small core team
while leveraging buying-power with material suppliers nationwide.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h5>CAN I CUSTOMIZE
THE FLOORPLAN?</h5>
<p>Acre’s fixed plans are a key component to keeping our homes
affordable, and ensuring NetZero performance. We have developed a variety of
plans in order to appeal to a wide range of families.  While we can’t
accommodate plan changes, we will use owner feedback to continuously refine our
offering.  If you don’t see what you’re looking for, please tell us!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h5>CAN I CUSTOMIZE
THE INTERIOR OR EXTERIOR FINISHES?</h5>
<p>Have an HOA that dictates exterior cladding options?  Your
grandma’s farmhouse sink?  A floor tile you’ve fallen in love with?
 If an owner wishes to use their own finish or fixture, they can delete it
from the building package and receive a credit. However, when it comes to
appliances, Acre cannot assume liability for energy consumption above our standard
appliance package.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>HOW DO YOU ACHIEVE NETZERO ENERGY PERFORMANCE?</b></p>
<p>Net-Zero homes produce as much energy as they
use year-round.  That means homeowners pay no energy bills.  Our
homes are 90% more efficient than standard construction to begin with, and we
make up the difference with a small solar panel (PV) array.<br/>
We start with an efficient floor plan and a tight building envelope to prevent
air from getting in or out. We use high-efficiency doors, windows, and
appliances, take advantage of natural (passive) heating from the sun, and
utilize unique heating and cooling solutions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>ARE YOUR HOMES OFF-GRID?</b></p>
<p>This depends on your goals and location. With
a battery storage system, any of our homes can be taken off-grid.<br/>
Within Kansas City limits, homes are required to be grid connected. In this
case we use the grid as our “battery”, selling power generated from our solar
panels to KCPL during the day, and buying back power at night.  Ensuring
that we always sell more than we buy keeps our homes NetZero.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>ARE ACRE HOMES PREFAB?</b></p>
<p>Our homes are built on-site using panelized
construction. We use SIPs panels, one of the most precise, efficient wall
systems on the market. Our system is so quick to install that once the Acre
Builder has the foundation prepared, walls and roof can be assembled in just 2
to 3 days! Unlike prefab, this means we don’t need a manufacturing facility and
can easily partner with material suppliers across the country. Plus
transporting panels vs. an entire prefab home doesn’t require special permits
or hefty fees.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT ARE SIPS PANELS AND WHY DO YOU USE THEM?</b></p>
<p>Structural insulated panels (SIPs) are a high
performance building system for residential and light commercial construction.
The panels consist of an insulating foam core sandwiched between two structural
facings, typically oriented strand board (OSB).  SIPs are manufactured
under factory controlled conditions, which means every window and door opening
is perfectly cut.  The walls are straight, highly durable, and sealed
tight.  Plus they don’t flex or move during severe weather.  Acre
partners with our SIPs manufacturer to get the highest efficiency out of each
of our home designs. The result is a building system that is extremely strong,
energy efficient and cost effective. Building with SIPs will save you time,
money and labor.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO BUILD?</b></p>
<p>For the Axiom House, we are attempting a 3.5
month build time.  This is about half the time of a traditional build, and
is a key component of keeping our costs low.</p>
</div>
</div></div>","Our vision is for a housing revolution to spread to the national market. Help us change the landscape for homeowners everywhere!
The Axiom House is a revolutionary kind of home.  It's NetZero, which means homeowners have no
energy bills and can use those savings each month to pay off their mortgage quickly, or live the kind of life they've dreamed of. And all for the cost of a standard house!  We've redesigned the entire process to create affordable, environmentally-friendly, technologically smart, and beautifully designed homes.

We're building the prototype in the Kansas City Startup Village, birthplace of
Google Fiber and the entrepreneurial hub of KC. The home will be open for
public events, tours, and demos, and will serve as a living laboratory for Acre
and for home tech entrepreneurs.

In the past 50 years, everything in our daily life has
modernized, been enhanced by technology, and become better, faster and cheaper.
Everything except our biggest investment: our homes. In that time homes have doubled
in size, energy consumption and percentage of your income.  And we're continuing to build 700,000+ of these outdated homes every year! This means:




Acre is bringing a solution to market that’s currently
unavailable.  To make this possible, we’re fixing problems
throughout the entire design and construction industry.  It’s a huge undertaking, which is why we need
your support! 




The prototype is more than just a home, it's the proving ground for all of these revolutionary concepts. As such, it will require funding, partnerships and support from our backers. Your contribution will make it possible to complete the home, as well as document the process in order to repeat this for homeowners nationwide.
















SMART: The Axiom house is smart, from functional design to the technology within. With tools that
connect seamlessly to eliminate stress and achieve the highest energy
performance, it's designed to fit the modern lifestyle – now, and into the
future.

EFFICIENT: Efficiency
is at the heart of all Acre homes. The result is a home that functions better, is
more comfortable, and is drastically better for the environment.
AFFORDABLE: We focus
on the real, all-in, cost of homes in order to make them truly affordable. With
no energy bills, owners can accelerate their mortgage for a savings of
$400,000, or more, over 30 years. A home like this can reshape your lifestyle

<b>BE
FOREWARNED…</b> <b>If you use drop-in
toilet cleaner tablets in your tank, read this:</b>
</h1>
<p>In the 1990s, after these tablets were introduced, toilet
manufacturers noticed an increase in repair calls on new toilets. Quality
checks indicated that toilet parts should not have worn out, so they conducted
further studies and discovered that the chemicals in the drop-in cleaner
tablets will eventually damage the flush valve, flapper and other parts in the
tank. Plastic and rubber parts, such as the gaskets and washers, were highly
susceptible to erosion. Eventually toilets leaked or didn't flush properly due
to the damage caused by the in-tank tablets. The longer a tablet sat in a tank
without a toilet being flushed, the quicker the erosion and damage to parts
occurred. Toilet manufacturers are now putting warning labels on their products
that ""damage caused by in-tank tablets will not be covered under product
warranties and should not be used.""</p>
<h3>Clean Flush will eliminate this problem and save you hundreds
of dollars on repair bills by putting the cleaning chemistry right into the
bowl and not the tank. <b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Clean Flush will use any brand cleaning tablet. </b>
</h3>
<p>We know why people like to use these cleaning tablets, </p>
<p>1) 
Cost far less than other cleaning tools, refill
cartridges and chemicals</p>
<p>2) 
Works better than harsh cleaners with less work</p>
<p>3) 
Leaves a fresh scent after every flush </p>

FOREWARNED… If you use drop-in
toilet cleaner tablets in your tank, read this:

In the 1990s, after these tablets were introduced, toilet
manufacturers noticed an increase in repair calls on new toilets. Quality
checks indicated that toilet parts should not have worn out, so they conducted
further studies and discovered that the chemicals in the drop-in cleaner
tablets will eventually damage the flush valve, flapper and other parts in the
tank. Plastic and rubber parts, such as the gaskets and washers, were highly
susceptible to erosion. Eventually toilets leaked or didn't flush properly due
to the damage caused by the in-tank tablets. The longer a tablet sat in a tank
without a toilet being flushed, the quicker the erosion and damage to parts
occurred. Toilet manufacturers are now putting warning labels on their products
that ""damage caused by in-tank tablets will not be covered under product
warranties and should not be used.""
Clean Flush will eliminate this problem and save you hundreds
of dollars on repair bills by putting the cleaning chemistry right into the
bowl and not the tank. Clean Flush will use any brand cleaning tablet. 

We know why people like to use these cleaning tablets, 
1) 
Cost far less than other cleaning tools, refill
cartridges and chemicals
2) 
Works better than harsh cleaners with less work
3) 
Leaves a fresh scent after every flush 
4) 
Ease of use 

Clean Flush will give you all these benefits without
the damage or repair bills.
Introducing Clean Flush, a New Type of Toilet Cleaning System that Kills Bacteria and Germs for less $$!
Uses any standard off the shelf toilet cleaning tablets.


Imagine a toilet cleaner that works with virtually no scrubbing effort.  Imagine a toilet cleaner that delivers what is promised.  Clean Flush introduces a new era of toilet cleaning. 
A durable, functional and cost-effective design is the
driving force behind Clean Flush - a product that results in less time spent cleaning toilets, is environmentally friendly, keeps your toilet clean and sanitized, and saves hundreds of dollars on chemical products for years to come.Technical SpecificationsMade from durable chemical resistant ABS Plastic and Vinyl  
Why we are different.
Well-integrated
Simplicity of design and installation makes it intuitively easy to use

Very Cost-Effective

Uses any ordinary toilet cleaning tablets 
No plastic waste to add to our landfills
  How It WorksWill work with any standard tank incorporating a fill valve and refill tube (both ball  and shaft float Fill Valves will work)




Simply remove the old refill hose and insert the Clean Flush System in between the refill valve and the refill tube. Clean Flush uses a standard 1/4 inch ID vinyl hose that will easily fit all standard refill valves.


The hoses can be easily cut to fit the right length needed.
Nothing is worse than having to spend hundreds of dollars a year and hours of time cleaning a toilet when there is a better way. Unlike other similar products that require you to purchase expensive refills and toss old ones in the trash, Clean Flush is made of a durable, long-lasting chemical-resistant material that uses typical toilet bowl tablets in a more effective and safe way.Many
toilet cleaning products that go into the toilet tank can damage the working
parts of the toilet, causing leaks that waste water or, worse, damage your home.
Clean Flush eliminates this problem by directing the cleaning chemistry directly into the refill reservoir so that it doesn't waste any cleaning product, and
sends the cleaning agent right into the bowl.  Each time the bowl is flushed, it is continuously being cleaned and disinfected. The prototype design has been tested in multiple households
over the past ten years and has proven to be a cost-effective product that
really works.  Every Clean Flush will be made right here in the USA.  When you put it all together, you get the best toilet cleaning solution ever, Clean Flush.

Tackling the compromise. No compromise he-he
Its unspecific form and proportions added a different meaning to storage, creating a need forunderstanding that specific environment. Therefore, appropriate solution to fulfill that meaning was modularity, instead of flipping the approach of designing from outside-in.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Reinventing the way you cook and socialize</h2>
<p>Glowen is a portable, wood (or gas) fired oven made from high grade stainless steel. The idea behind Glowen is that it takes everything that's good about traditional stone ovens and improves on everything that's inconvenient about them.</p>
<p>Let's focus on the good first. Just as traditional stone ovens, the Glowen is: </p>
<p>1. Extremely powerful, as it heats up to 700°C which allows for really puffy pizzas.<br/>2. Incredibly efficient, capable of burning large, 300 x 100 wood pieces for longer periods of time<br/>3. Big enough to cook multiple large pizzas at the same time in 470 x 580 mm sized cooking area.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at why Glowen is an improvement from traditional ovens.</p>
<p>1. Foldable and transportable, so you can take it anywhere.<br/>2. Much cheaper than the stone variant.<br/>2. Heats up much faster, from 0 to 700°C in well under 25 min.<br/>4. Removable firebox, allowing you to fire up Glowen with ease outside the chamber.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Glowen's extreme heat allows you to make extra puffy pizzas.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Glowen is intended for people who love to socialize and cook - particularly those with extended families and lots of friends - as well as for profesional chefs, caterings, restaurants and food truck owners. It's powerful and efficient enough to cook for a large concert; which we have proven at both Overjam festival and Metaldays in Tolmin where we made 4000 pizzas over 5 days in just 2 ovens. However, you can make so much more than just pizza in Glowen. For example, we made burgers, steaks, lasagna, seafood, even desserts.</p>
<p>We want our oven to be as non-restrictive as possible and allow you to make everything your heart (or your belly) desires!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Even a complete beginner will need no more than 20 minutes to have Glowen burning up at it's full power. A master chef, much less.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We understand there are comparable ovens on the market already, but simply put they are just toys compared to Glowen. </p>
<p>Glowen is bigger, more powerful and capable of feeding a larger number of people in less time while burning less fuel. This means it saves you more time and money as well as allowing you to be more care-free while cooking since you don't have to load additional fuel all the time. It's easier to light thanks to a removable firebox at the back of the oven and easier to operate because it's superb effciency removes the need for an oven door. Here's a quick FAQ as well as a video about the ultimate test: 700 pizzas in just 10 hours!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Is Glowen really the best oven on the market?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Absolutely! The biggest differences are that it's much more efficient and about ten times more powerful. You can literally feed a festival full of people!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A full festival?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Yup! We've proven it at many festivals in Tolmin, including MetalDays and OverJam. We baked over 4000 pizzas in 5 days in just 2 ovens!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How does Glowen handle that much abuse?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Both ovens were running for full two months and still work as good as new! Glowen is not only powerful and efficient but also incredibly durable.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>From stone oven to Glowen</strong></h2>
<p>Ever since I was a little kid and my grandma taught me how to make a pizza I wanted to own a wood-fired oven. We never had the room nor the money for such an oven at home. Fortunately though, one of my friends did. While visiting and cooking at their place I figured out there's a lot of downsides to your traditional wood-fired oven. Mainly, it takes way too long to reach the correct temperature as well as it obviously isn't mobile. When cooking for my friends or family I just don't want to be dependent on time, place or anything else really.</p>
<p>After a few long years and many different jobs, I felt like I had enough knowledge and experience to make my dream come true. Before my first concept oven ""Martha"" I already built a traditional oven from waste material and after that 5 more ovens that never really made it out of the prototype stage.</p>
<p>Martha got a lot of backlash after her first introduction. People laughed and waved it off, saying ""that's not going to work"". But I didn't let it get to me and soon Martha was ready for testing. It shut everybody right up since it was working much better than even I anticipated.</p>
<p>It was all very bittersweet, though. As it usually is the case with inventions, everybody wanted a piece of the pie. I had to trademark my design as soon as possible and with help from my lawyer friend, I did.</p>
<p>In the following weeks, I extensively tested Martha and quickly figured that I've got a lot more work to do. A few problems needed addressing and production cost absolutely had to be lowered - so I can make my work accessible to many. I started almost from scratch, kept the good, dealt with the bad, added some goodies and Glowen was born.</p>

<p>However, we do have a slight problem. If we go down the investor route the price tag of our oven will skyrocket and will only be available to the select few. We don't want that.

</center><hr/><h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>Peter Steenbergen here from: J1nx .:Hackable Gadgets:.</p>
<p>Some folks already know me the gathering of tweakers community, some from the XBMC community, others from the Allwinner community, but maybe most of you don't know me at all. For the last couple of years I am active in the ""hackable"" gadgets world. The last year and a half running the community website and very recently webshop <a href=""http://www.j1nx.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.j1nx.nl</a></p>
<h4>At J1nx.nl we have very strong affinity with open source and we fully support the concept of open hardware aka hackable gadgets.</h4>
<p>We aim to be your number 1 gateway of gadget hacking information and the corresponding hardware and at this moment we have set our focus on the AMLogic 8726-M3 hardware. A LOT of hardware uses this specific SoC, but up till now most released related software sources were not fully matching the hardware (MBX - f16ref).</p>
<p>After an extensive search and weeks of communication with the far east we succeeded to find a supplier who can deliver;</p>
<ul>
<li>A Set Top Box, with external wifi antenna</li>
<li>A populated UART connector on the inside</li>
<li>The willingness to support the box by releasing the FULL software build system</li>
<li>This included the Linux kernel sources and drivers</li>
<li>The U-Boot bootloader system sources including the proper def_config file.</li>
</ul><p>As the hardware (f16ref) is the same as for instance the OvalElephant Smart TV Box / Stick and the GBox Midnight / dyno we are very confident the software sources can flow back into those development projects as well.</p>

<h3>UPDATE 1:</h3>
<p>Some folks came to me stating the price is rather high. This is indeed so if you compare it to any Chinese box, which you might import ""illegally"" into your country on your own. (I don't accuse anybody here ;) )</p>
<p>Our price is based on EU (Netherlands) laws and include all the import taxes and VAT.</p>
<p>So if you order it within the EU, some bucks might be added for shipping but that's about it! (I am working out some plans to minimise the shipping costs)</p>
<p>IF you order the box from outside the EU, you are responsible for the tax in your own country, so the VAT will be deducted from the price. Shipping might be more expensive, but overall the price should stay around the same. (I don't have hard numbers as of yet)</p>

<h3>The Smart TV Box</h3>
<p>The Set Top Box has greyish metalic finish. Two full size USB ports on the front for easily connecting any stick with your media. A SD/MMC/MS 3 in 1 card slot. But more important, a fully populated UART connector on the inside of the box. Just like the famous Allwinner Mele A1000/A2000. Hook up the UART TTL to USB convertor and you have a full serial console. Happy hacking!</p>

<p> </p></div>","Let's open up the AMLogic 8726-M3 boxes
Hi there!
Peter Steenbergen here from: J1nx .:Hackable Gadgets:.
Some folks already know me the gathering of tweakers community, some from the XBMC community, others from the Allwinner community, but maybe most of you don't know me at all. For the last couple of years I am active in the ""hackable"" gadgets world. The last year and a half running the community website and very recently webshop www.j1nx.nl
At J1nx.nl we have very strong affinity with open source and we fully support the concept of open hardware aka hackable gadgets.
We aim to be your number 1 gateway of gadget hacking information and the corresponding hardware and at this moment we have set our focus on the AMLogic 8726-M3 hardware. A LOT of hardware uses this specific SoC, but up till now most released related software sources were not fully matching the hardware (MBX - f16ref).
After an extensive search and weeks of communication with the far east we succeeded to find a supplier who can deliver;

A Set Top Box, with external wifi antenna
A populated UART connector on the inside
The willingness to support the box by releasing the FULL software build system
This included the Linux kernel sources and drivers
The U-Boot bootloader system sources including the proper def_config file.
As the hardware (f16ref) is the same as for instance the OvalElephant Smart TV Box / Stick and the GBox Midnight / dyno we are very confident the software sources can flow back into those development projects as well.
Imagine what we can do with that !

 
But it does not come for free!
We have to talk the world wide universal language ""$""
We live in a commercial world so for us to get ""our hands"" on the software sources we have to buy some related hardware. We are talking about the above mentioned Set Top Box. If we manage to fund raise enough to buy a minimum quantity of 500, the vendor is willing to release the sources.
So to break it down;

Buying 500 boxes
Sea freight shipment
Import Duties
pre-paying the EU taxes over hardware, shipping and import duties
Costs for warranty and DOA's
Crowndfunding platform costs
Small costs to be able to ""(re)sale"" the received boxes.
Total of : $43.753,-
 
So how do we get there?
$5,- Thanks for the support!
By supporting us with your $5, you're making a statement. A statement that you believe in open software, open hardware, hackable gadgets, and ofcourse you will receive our eternal gratitude. We will keep you up to data about all the developments, so you don't miss a thing.
 
$25,- Development Supporter!
In addition of the above, we'll put your name (or Pseudonym of your choice) on the project / product page on our website. Secondly you will receive a USB->TTL PL2303 serial console convertor, with which you are able to start hacking into many boxes.
 
$99,- Developers Package
Receive all of the above including the Set Top Box it self. The box on it self can boot straight into Android and already make your TV a whole lot smarter.

 
$500,- | $1000,- | $2500,- Business packages.
Are you a business and want to support us while still making some money out of this project? Contact us to see how we can cooperate and get the best out of it for all parties.
 
UPDATE 1:
Some folks came to me stating the price is rather high. This is indeed so if you compare it to any Chinese box, which you might import ""illegally"" into your country on your own. (I don't accuse anybody here ;) )
Our price is based on EU (Netherlands) laws and include all the import taxes and VAT.
So if you order it within the EU, some bucks might be added for shipping but that's about it! (I am working out some plans to minimise the shipping costs)
IF you order the box from outside the EU, you are responsible for the tax in your own country, so the VAT will be deducted from the price. Shipping might be more expensive, but overall the price should stay around the same. (I don't have hard numbers as of yet)
 
The Smart TV Box
The Set Top Box has greyish metalic finish. Two full size USB ports on the front for easily connecting any stick with your media. A SD/MMC/MS 3 in 1 card slot. But more important, a fully populated UART connector on the inside of the box. Just like the famous Allwinner Mele A1000/A2000. Hook up the UART TTL to USB convertor and you have a full serial console. Happy hacking!

We were asked to redesign a recipe keeping the user in mind. After baking the same recipe several times over, I realised just how frustrated I kept being over having to take my computer with me to the kitchen or getting the printed recipe grease-stained, making it undecipherable. I needed to find a better solution which is where the idea of having my recipe on a tea towel came from. That way, I wouldn’t feel bad about getting it dirty, it could sustain stains without compromising legibility, I wouldn’t have to squint to read the fine print on my computer or have to worry about how to press the down arrow with dirty hands so I could read the following steps and, on top of that, I could use my recipe for more than just baking.</p><p></p><p>                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/702937/files/20140708113157-sketchbook_towel.jpg?1404844317"" src="""" style=""width: 443.1434689507494px; height: 389px;""/> </p><p><i>First ever sketch of a Bake On towel.</i></p><p>It started with A4 sheets of paper taped together, then a badly transferred version on some leftover piece of fabric, then test after test with different printing methods and fabrics.

<p></p></div>","The video has Danish, French and Spanish subtitles.Pour les Français, c'est par ici.Bake On is a collection of screen printed, baking tea towels on which are featured step-by-step recipes. Basically, they are a new type of tea towels that allow you to bake directly on them. They feature (delicious) recipes of either cakes, cookies, cupcakes, frostings and muffins. No need to bring a computer to the kitchen or feel bad about staining your pristine recipe book any more; you simply need to lay the towel out on your kitchen work space, put all your ingredients directly on it and follow the steps.They’re also just like regular tea towels so you can use them to dry dishes, wipe the table and what not.Bake On is for any and every baker, no matter their age or experience. The towels are also great for families with young kids who want to be involved and help create something absolutely delicious. They are very intuitive and baking with them is as simple as following the arrows.They make a great birthday, wedding and/or Christmas present for people who love to bake, as they usually have a well-equipped kitchen already and thus can be hard finding a present for.They also look terrific in a kitchen, replacing old and boring tea-towels. So it's an excellent idea for people who just like nice things around them.The idea of Bake On came from an assignment I picked while studying Graphics at university, in London. We were asked to redesign a recipe keeping the user in mind. After baking the same recipe several times over, I realised just how frustrated I kept being over having to take my computer with me to the kitchen or getting the printed recipe grease-stained, making it undecipherable. I needed to find a better solution which is where the idea of having my recipe on a tea towel came from. That way, I wouldn’t feel bad about getting it dirty, it could sustain stains without compromising legibility, I wouldn’t have to squint to read the fine print on my computer or have to worry about how to press the down arrow with dirty hands so I could read the following steps and, on top of that, I could use my recipe for more than just baking.                     First ever sketch of a Bake On towel.It started with A4 sheets of paper taped together, then a badly transferred version on some leftover piece of fabric, then test after test with different printing methods and fabrics. It took countless iterations, both with design and printing methods and even more emails to screen printers all over Europe, the US and New Zealand, and here we are, with great towels and a fantastic printer to boot!My bedroom walls ended up completely covered in annotated Bake On 'towels' by the time I moved out.Yes, really. I know it may sound a bit excessive but for $15 you will be getting a high quality, 100% cotton towel. The towels are made from 10oz cotton and weigh approximately 235gsm per square meter. They are hemmed on all four sides and measure about 78cms x 48cms (38.7in x 18.9in) - please note that the cloth size may vary slightly.The towels are screen printed (with love) in the United Kingdom with highly sustainable, water based inks.Also, this is a special discounted price only for this campaign; you are getting them 25% cheaper than their post-campaign retail price.



Backing this campaign will allow you to get your choice of perks if the campaign hits the $12,500 goal.Here are the rewards I've assembled for you, to thank you for your help.For high-res version, click here.For high-res version, click here.For high-res version, click here.For high-res version, click here.For high-res version, click here.For high-res version, click here.For high-res version, click here.For high-res version, click here.For high-res version, click here.For high-res version, click here.



So far, Bake On is comprised of 15 recipes divided into 5 different lines: cakes, cookies, cupcakes, frostings and muffins.With your help I'd like to expand the collection to add a primal (no processed sugars nor flours) and a pies line; and add more recipes. Check out the Stretch Goals section for more about that. Here are the recipes you can already choose from for your perks:   If you back the campaign, you will be able to pick any of these recipes and any of the ones that get unlocked if we reach any of the stretch goals. No matter when you pledge or when the goals are met. If it's unlocked, it's up for grabs!



Want to have a wider choice of recipes? You're paleo/primal and would love a towel that caters to that? Pies are your all time favourite? This is what stretch goals are for! Once we get closer to reaching the initial $12.500 goal, I'll reveal what we can aim for next and what options could be available to you.Again, no matter when you pledge or when the stretch goals are met, if it's unlocked, you can choose it. So if you're primal and would like to support Bake On, don't hesitate to pledge even if the primal goal hasn't been met yet, your help will actually help us get there and you will be that much more likely to get the line available.



The entire collection is ready for production but I sadly don’t have the funds to launch it on my own. This campaign will allow me to produce 50 towels of each one of my initial 15 recipes (which adds up to a total of 750 towels!). It will also help cover initial one-off costs such as the screens required for the printing process.Here's a quick breakdown as to how I'm going to use the 12.5K   Production costs: These cover the costs of the screens, towels, printing of the tea towels, shipping from the printer over to Denmark, packaging and taxes.Expenses linked to the campaign: These cover the production of the tote bags (which will only be available through the campaign), a part of the costs linked to the pitch video as well as all the small expenses that come with shipping perks (i.e. the envelopes, tape, etc.).Unforeseen expenses: These are pretty straight forward. As ready as I may be, and no matter how many times I run the numbers, there is always a chance that something unexpected might pop up. I don't want to run the risk of taking your money and being unable to deliver your perks, so these 15.5% are a buffer to make sure you get what you paid for. You know, just in case something does happen.Indiegogo and credit card fees: If the campaign is successful, I'll need to pay these fees to Indiegogo and the credit card companies.





Here's a timeline as to what's meant to happen in the next few months, and when it's happening:In the end of campaign questionnaire, you'll tell me which towel(s) you want and where you want me to send them to. That's also when you'll be able to vote for the next designs to be developed. These questionnaires are very important so please make sure you enter a valid email address or I won't be able to reach you.As you can see, I've arranged to have the towels shipped out a little over a month before Christmas to make sure you receive them on time for you to slip them under the tree. I've also included some wiggle room in case things go a bit slower than expected. Again, however thoroughly things may be planned, there's always a chance of something unexpected happening.All of the orders will be shipped with priority mail. They should only take about a week or less to get to you. Out-of-EU orders will be shipped first.Do let me know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions. You can reach me at chris@bakeon.netI will try as hard as possible to answer any and all questions and comments that are left on the comments page but the easiest way to get immediate assistance is to email me.Don't forget to like and follow the Bake On Facebook page for the latest news.



When will I be able to choose my towel's recipe?If we meet the 12.5K goal, I will send you a questionnaire after the campaign ends. In there you'll be able to pick the recipe(s) you want - if you fancy several of the same recipe, that's totally fine. That's also when you'll tell me where to send your towel(s). And when you'll be able to vote for the next recipes to be designed.I made a contribution for several towels, can I pick the same recipe several times?First of, thanks for your contribution, I’m really grateful.

<p><strong>Curtain Claws!</strong></p>
<p>I’ve sold curtains for more than 15 years and worked with thousands of clients, and I’ve always felt there was something missing. Curtain Claws are the solution!<br/><br/>Curtain Claws provide a simple alternative to installed tiebacks. The Claws simply close around your curtain fabric for a secure hold that won’t damage the material. Fitted with specially designed interchangeable faceplates, Curtain Claws allow you to easily and inexpensively change your tiebacks regularly, to match the season, or not at all – it’s up to you.  </p>
<p>By helping to fund this campaign, you will help me introduce to consumers an inexpensive and easy-to-use product that will make their homes more comfortable and comforting. And isn’t that something we all need?</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>We invested initially in developing the perfect prototype. Several product attributes were critical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality, durable material that slides smoothly around the curtain, with the ability to hold the curtain securely while at the same time protecting the fabric</li>
<li>Sleek, simple, tasteful medallions and faceplates</li>
<li>Versatile enough to work with most curtains, from sheer tapestries to heavy duty black out curtains</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the design and engineering phase of Curtain Claws is complete, and our product has patents pending, the purpose of this campaign is to raise the funds necessary to support tooling and an initial production run for this product. We will be producing Curtain Claws through our partner Arciplex, based in Nashville, Tennessee. We've been working together for more than a year and they've been very supportive of our goals. </p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you not only will receive our amazing Curtain Claws sets, but also my personal thanks – I know this product belongs in the marketplace and I know it will bring joy to consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Support Curtain Claws</strong></p>
<p>We’ve created several “perks” with the goal of allowing you to support this campaign financially at a level that works for you, while at the same time having the opportunity to be a “first user” of this amazing product. You can view all of our perks on the right side of this page. Please note that all perks include final manufactured products (not a prototype).</p>
<p>Our Standard Set has been our most popular offering to date. This perk includes 4 Curtain Claws and 4 Medallions.</p>

<p><strong>We can do this!</strong></p>
<p>The process of developing the product prototype was not as straightforward as I anticipated. I had very clear ideas about materials, quality, functionality, and design, and it took a few attempts to get the prototype to where it needed to be. I remained determined throughout this process, educating myself along the way, and I intend to use this same focus, determination, and attention to detail to bring this product to the consumers who I believe are waiting for it! As an added bonus, Arciplex, our manufacturer, adds value through their work on several successful crowd-funding campaigns.</p>

<p>My name is Jerry Avey. I was a professional portrait photographer for over 40 years and an over the road truck driver for 5 years.<br/>I am the past president and life member of the Rocky Mountain Professional Photographers Association. Founder and past president, life member of International Christian Photographers. Former board member of the Kiwanis Club of Boulder CO with the emphases on fund raising. Board Member for Mother House, a home for pregnant women in need, with an emphases on the new home building fund and fund raising. </p>
<p>I have been inventing things for most of my adult life. I would have an idea, go to my workshop and make the item, in some cases I have used that item for nearly 20 years and still use it. The 'MELON PEELER', has been my focus for the last 3 or 4 years and now have used and worked with the prototype for a few years.

My name is Jerry Avey. I was a professional portrait photographer for over 40 years and an over the road truck driver for 5 years.I am the past president and life member of the Rocky Mountain Professional Photographers Association. Founder and past president, life member of International Christian Photographers. Former board member of the Kiwanis Club of Boulder CO with the emphases on fund raising. Board Member for Mother House, a home for pregnant women in need, with an emphases on the new home building fund and fund raising. 
I have been inventing things for most of my adult life. I would have an idea, go to my workshop and make the item, in some cases I have used that item for nearly 20 years and still use it. The 'MELON PEELER', has been my focus for the last 3 or 4 years and now have used and worked with the prototype for a few years. I have the tooling to make the molds and the manufacturing ready to go.
 
We are seeking funding to have the injection molds made for the MELON PEELER. (made of High Impact Lustran ABS) This will make the price point more affordable for the kitchen wares market.
We are retired and can't live on Social Security alone and Truck Driving keeps us away from home and family. So being able to sell MELON PEELERS will greatly improve the quality of life in retirement and be able to take care of ourselves and not really on family later in life.


Our Goal:
$70,000.00 to make the molds and produce the peelers, packaging and pay for the mailing of your rewards..

What You Get:
For every $25.00 pledged you receive a MELON PEELER with directions and a heartfelt Thank You for pledging support for our campaign.

What the money will be used for:
The MELON PEELER base injection mold will cost $31,770.00. The mold for the blade will cost $7,725.00. Other expenses: Production of the MELON PEELER and blade, suction cups, packaging and shipping.

Delivery Times:
3 to 4 months after the close of our Indiegogo offering. It takes time to create molds and run the production.

What will happen after Indiegogo Campaign?
We had the opportunity to demonstrate the MELON PEELER in Chicago at the International House Wares Show. Buyers from all around the world, many companies sell wholesale or retail, but don't manufacture and would have placed orders, had we have had stock.

This is why, after a successful launch and delivery of the Noocity Growbed and after many requests in this regard, we're back on Indiegogo to present the NOOCITY GROWKIT - an Urban Agriculture Kit for Beginners!The NOOCITY GROWKIT consists of an efficient gardening system packed together with all the needed ingredients and the required guidance. There’s no problem of space for installing the equipment, no waste of time buying all the parts and parcels and no pre-required ability or knowledge. You'll get everything you need to start growing organic food at home right away! 
Everything you need packed together! 
01 THE GROWBAG
The Growbag is an adapted version of the Noocity Growbed, providing in a more portable size the same advantages: a sub-irrigated system and ground height that allows you to keep watering autonomy, low consumption and great production results.
  The sub-irrigation system provides water to plants through the root zone.By reducing the evaporation and watering frequency, ends up consuming 80% less water than a conventional cultivation system. In addition, avoids the common mistake of watering to much or to less, increasing the success rate of your garden, the productivity and plants' health.Easy to assemble your growbag will be ready to use in few minutes with no need of any tools!   02 THE GROWPACKThe Growpack is composed by a carefully and seasonal selection of organic plug plants specially chosen for inexperienced growers, and by a bottle of the appropriate organic fertilizer to help you keep your plants nourished in the healthiest way possible.  03 THE GROWGUIDEIf you’re asking yourself “Where do I start?” don’t worry: the Growguide a set of audio guides, will provide you clear guidance along the way. Designed by our Noocity Gardener Pedro Rocha, this set of tutorials will introduce you to the main concepts of Urban Agriculture and give you the best tips to grow and nourish your vegetable garden!  All the packaging solutions presented for the Noocity Growkit, are either fully recyclable or completely compostable.Reasons for you to get your Growkit Select your Perk * As encomendas para o Brasil serão produzidas e entregues pela Noocity BrasilOrders for Brazil will be produced and delivered by Noocity Brasil

What can be built using MoodyLight? ^
We'd like to present you few examples, of what can be built using MoodyLight platform. All these examples are there free for use, so don't hesitate to buy our products, just because you want to build it yourself.It's up to you what you invent, we just created few basic applications, certainly not covering all the possible uses. Also there will be option to publish your projects, as soon as you document them, on our website. We can't wait to see your ideas !Star Sky ^
This is created with 60 LEDs (one meter of LED strip) and one square meter of fibreboard. Powered by external PSU just for extra stability.Showed effects are animated GIFs, not realtime projections of effects.RainbowEntropyStormCeiling and Aluminium profile lights ^
Both types (square ceiling light and aluminium profile) has 60 LEDs within. Ceiling light is IKEA bought case, where controlling board can be placed inside, under matt sky cover. Aluminium profile is 1.6cm (0.6 inches) wide where we just sticked the LED strip to the bottom and covered with opal glass.Ambilight for computers ^
Ambilight is done using 11 LEDs on bend aluminium pipe (can be made also with 255 LEDs, we just simplified it a lot), powered by battery pack and connected to laptop using Bluetooth. We also have special software, which we will publish for you, as soon as this campaign is funded, which scans current screen contents and reflects it using LEDs.Floor lamp ^
This is standard IKEA light, where we put a strip of aluminium (40 inches long) twisted into helix, LED strip was sticked on it and was covered with one layer of translucent paper and second layer official paper cover. Snowboard helmet ^
Helmet is done using 10 LEDs covered by transparent water resistant glue. Three cables are connected via long jack connector (three sections) to battery pack and MoodyLight board placed in backpack. Jägermeister ^
While working on the MoodyLight, we got to get project for Jägermeister company, in cooperation with studio SPOT-ON. We added the MoodyLight platform (using 10 LEDs, 4 for each eye and 2 for snout) and battery pack.Domotiga / SmartVISU ^
We also created interface for Home automatisation Domotiga (but you are not limited, feel free to use any home automatisation software). Interfaces will be given out open-source as soon as this campaign is funded.Domotiga is open-source automatisation software without user interface, screenshots are from SmartVISU, one of the user interfaces to home automatisation. This is real application from demonstration setup, no photoshop involved :-)

We know that most window and wall air conditioning units offer basic
programmability to set the desired schedule and room temperature. But the
Monolyth will learn and adapt to your everyday schedule through multiple
sensors that gather data from the surrounding environment. It will track what
time you usually wake up, what time you leave the house and when you go to bed.
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/689878/files/20140702103933-kickstarter-W_8.jpg?1404322773"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Once Monolyth learns your schedule, it will automatically adjust the
temperature. We realize no schedule is set in stone, which is why you can
easily reprogram the Monolyth if you’ll be out of the house for extended
periods of time for holidays or business. The longer the device is in use, the
smarter it becomes. <br/><br/><h3><b>Energy Savings - Save up to 40%!</b></h3><b>
</b><p>Monolyth is designed to help you reduce energy costs. Here’s how:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/723609/files/20140716234756-kickstarter-W_9.jpg?1405579676"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>Geofencing</b></p>
<p><b>Adjusting when you leave the house</b> </p>
<p>There’s no need to have your AC on full power while you’re at work. But even
if you forget to turn it off, the Monolyth device will sense you’re away and
automatically power off. With Monolyth, you can reduce costs effortlessly
because your AC will adapt to your lifestyle.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/723618/files/20140716234843-kickstarter-W_2_copy_7.jpg?1405579723"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>Coming home </b></p>

If
you break your routine, the Monolyth will create your preferable environment
prior to your arrival home.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/723623/files/20140716234907-kickstarter-W_2_copy_6.jpg?1405579747"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b>Adjusting to the weather forecast</b> </p>
<p>By monitoring indoor and outdoor temperatures, humidity levels and air
quality, your air conditioning is automatically adjusted for optimized comfort
and lower energy bills. If temperatures are abnormally low, the Monolyth can
detect this and stay at a more pleasant level.</p>
<p><b>Adjusting when you’re away for extended periods of time </b></p>
<p>This feature is especially handy if you’re leaving town for a business trip
or holiday. While you’re away you can turn the AC off and turn it on prior your
arrival. It’s as simple as commanding your AC to turn on when you’re at baggage
claim so your house is perfectly cool when you arrive home.</p>
<p><b>Easy scheduling </b></p>
<p>You can also set or quickly adjust daily or weekly scheduling for heating or
cooling, temperature levels, fan speed etc., so if your routine changes you
have the freedom to adjust your Monolyth. Users have the option to set up to 6
time periods per day. This allows the Monolyth to learn additional commands as
you continue to use it. </p><br/><h3>Monolyth is packed with multiple sensors!</h3>
<p>The device contains multiple environmental sensors that gather data from the
surrounding environment. This allows the Monolyth to adjust temperature for
your comfort and to save you energy. Here are the different sensors inside.</p>
<p><b>Presence sensors</b></p>
<p>Monolyth will optimize temperature levels based on your presence and
movement. The presence sensors are what allow the Monolyth to know whether
you’re awake or asleep.</p>
<p><b>Temperature sensor </b></p>
<p>Optimize temperature levels in your home or office.</p>
<p><b>Humidity sensor </b></p>
<p>Packing a humidity sensor, Monolyth will provide tips via push
notification  on how to optimize humidity levels in your home.</p>
<p><b>Barometric Air Pressure sensor</b> </p>
<p>With the barometric air pressure sensor you have the ability to see the
exact weather forecast in your local environment.</p>
<p><b>Air Quality &amp; VOCs </b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

According
to US Environmental Protection Agency volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals in your home which may have short and
long term health effects. Sources for VOCs are household products such as;
paints, cleaning supplies and disinfectants, wood preservatives, air
fresheners, dry-cleaned clothing, carpets, wood stoves etc. Concentrations of
many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than
outdoors. Health effect could be anything from eye, nose, and throat irritation
to headaches, loss of coordination, nausea or even damage to liver, kidney, and
central nervous system.</p>
<p>One
of the steps to reduce exposure to VOCs is to make sure you provide plenty of
fresh air in your home. The next most important thing would be the maintenance
of your AC filter.  AC units don’t just cool your home, but also filter
your air.  However the air quality in your room is only as good as the
filter in your AC unit. </p>
<p>Monolyth
monitors your air quality with VOCs sensors and will inform you when VOCs
exceed acceptable levels. You can also set it up to send you a notification
when the windows need to be opened or when the AC filter should be replaced.</p>

<p>We are team of dedicated makers, engineers and researchers and we are on a
mission to build the first connected device to make your AC unit smart. We
don’t compromise. We have choose the best sensors available on the market to
sense air quality in your living and working environment. We are using multiple
sensors to measure temperature, humidity, air quality, luminosity, noise and
even atmospheric pressure. Monolyth can measure all the parameters that matters
for your living environment and can also predict weather forecast for your local micro climate.</p>
<p>Then we control. Yes we control your AC unit based on those accurate
measurements. We can control almost any AC unit using array of infrared
emitters built into the Monolyth that can replicate your infrared remote
control. We can also detect your presence based on the state-of-the art
location detection technology, specially developed for Monolyth. Based on the
presence detection, data from the cloud and advanced algorithms, Monolyth can
set optimal parameters for your comfort and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Monolyth is connected to the internet via your Wi-Fi network. Connection to
the internet allows you to monitor and control your environment from anywhere
in the world.</p>
<p>The first prototype was built using Arduino development platform, IR
receiver and IR emitter. The IR receiver was used to capture IR packets sent
from remote control. Packets were later successfully re-transmitted using IR
emitter. Second prototype was developed using ARM Cortex M0 platform. Due to
additional new sensors (from Freescale, NXP, STM, Murata, etc.) and the
complexity of algorithms used for measurement and presence detection, we had to
use more powerful core, the ARM Cortex M3 platform. In the latest prototype we
also added Wi-Fi module TI CC3000 to the board and enabled Monolyth to become
the internet connected device.</p>
<p>Our team has years of experience developing electronics, so we have designed
latest prototype with component availability and manufacturing process in mind.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FKiPXauzmOfg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKiPXauzmOfg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FKiPXauzmOfg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/689403/files/20140702070214-6I1C8696.jpg?1404309734"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/689405/files/20140702070308-6I1C8702.jpg?1404309788"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h1>Production Timeline</h1><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/698870/files/20140707050156-milestones_8_copy.png?1404734516"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h2><b>Monolyth Team</b></h2><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/693992/files/20140704055526-Team2.jpg?1404478526"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Our vision to make people’s everyday lives more convenient and energy

control your AC from anywhere in the world giving you complete control.The MonolythControl your AC from anywhere. Really. Anywhere.
Monolyth is controlled via WiFi on the iOS and Android application. So to
adjust or control your air conditioning you just need an internet connection
and your phone or tablet. Monolyth controls your air conditioning unit by using
IR emitters.The app, offers you ultimate control over air
conditioning temperatures no matter where you are, letting you change settings,
scheduling, check weather and setup push notifications. Control multiple air conditioning units at your home or officeYou can use your Monolyth for your home, office or any other additional
properties and control as many AC units per property as you want.

Monolyth will learn and adapt to your everyday schedule!

We know that most window and wall air conditioning units offer basic
programmability to set the desired schedule and room temperature. But the
Monolyth will learn and adapt to your everyday schedule through multiple
sensors that gather data from the surrounding environment. It will track what
time you usually wake up, what time you leave the house and when you go to bed.
Once Monolyth learns your schedule, it will automatically adjust the
temperature. We realize no schedule is set in stone, which is why you can
easily reprogram the Monolyth if you’ll be out of the house for extended
periods of time for holidays or business. The longer the device is in use, the
smarter it becomes. Energy Savings - Save up to 40%!
Monolyth is designed to help you reduce energy costs. Here’s how:Geofencing
Adjusting when you leave the house 
There’s no need to have your AC on full power while you’re at work. But even
if you forget to turn it off, the Monolyth device will sense you’re away and
automatically power off. With Monolyth, you can reduce costs effortlessly
because your AC will adapt to your lifestyle.Coming home 

If
you break your routine, the Monolyth will create your preferable environment
prior to your arrival home.Adjusting to the weather forecast 
By monitoring indoor and outdoor temperatures, humidity levels and air
quality, your air conditioning is automatically adjusted for optimized comfort
and lower energy bills. If temperatures are abnormally low, the Monolyth can
detect this and stay at a more pleasant level.
Adjusting when you’re away for extended periods of time 
This feature is especially handy if you’re leaving town for a business trip
or holiday. While you’re away you can turn the AC off and turn it on prior your
arrival. It’s as simple as commanding your AC to turn on when you’re at baggage
claim so your house is perfectly cool when you arrive home.
Easy scheduling 
You can also set or quickly adjust daily or weekly scheduling for heating or
cooling, temperature levels, fan speed etc., so if your routine changes you
have the freedom to adjust your Monolyth. Users have the option to set up to 6
time periods per day. This allows the Monolyth to learn additional commands as
you continue to use it. Monolyth is packed with multiple sensors!
The device contains multiple environmental sensors that gather data from the
surrounding environment. This allows the Monolyth to adjust temperature for
your comfort and to save you energy. Here are the different sensors inside.
Presence sensors
Monolyth will optimize temperature levels based on your presence and
movement. The presence sensors are what allow the Monolyth to know whether
you’re awake or asleep.
Temperature sensor 
Optimize temperature levels in your home or office.
Humidity sensor 
Packing a humidity sensor, Monolyth will provide tips via push
notification  on how to optimize humidity levels in your home.
Barometric Air Pressure sensor 
With the barometric air pressure sensor you have the ability to see the
exact weather forecast in your local environment.
Air Quality & VOCs 




According
to US Environmental Protection Agency volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals in your home which may have short and
long term health effects. Sources for VOCs are household products such as;
paints, cleaning supplies and disinfectants, wood preservatives, air
fresheners, dry-cleaned clothing, carpets, wood stoves etc. Concentrations of
many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than
outdoors. Health effect could be anything from eye, nose, and throat irritation
to headaches, loss of coordination, nausea or even damage to liver, kidney, and
central nervous system.
One
of the steps to reduce exposure to VOCs is to make sure you provide plenty of
fresh air in your home. The next most important thing would be the maintenance
of your AC filter.  AC units don’t just cool your home, but also filter
your air.  However the air quality in your room is only as good as the
filter in your AC unit. 
Monolyth
monitors your air quality with VOCs sensors and will inform you when VOCs
exceed acceptable levels. You can also set it up to send you a notification
when the windows need to be opened or when the AC filter should be replaced.
For
more information on VOCs please follow this link. 
Monitor and understand your living environmentMonolyth enables
historical tracking of indoor & outdoor temperature, humidity, air pressure, noise
and air quality / VOCs (Volatile organic compounds) levels.Installation / Plug & Play
Monolyth works right out of the box and is compatible with 200 leading AC
brands. When setting up your Monolyth device, it should be placed in the
line-of-sight with your AC unit. This enables a clear connection via the
infrared sensor. The application wizard then leads the way for an easy setup.
Follow the link for a list of supported AC units. The
list will be constantly updated with new models, so you can keep using your
Monolyth with new AC units. If your AC unit is not on the list, you can still
manually configure Monolyth through a simple set-up wizard using your mobile
phone and AC remote control.Monolyth is pet friendly 
You can keep your pets comfortable when you’re away with the ‘’never below’’
or ‘’never above’’ settings. The temperature is guaranteed to stay within a
specific limit ensuring your animals are safe and sound. OPEN API & SDK
We would like to encourage our users to use our open REST API and customize their
own solutions and integrate Monolyth into 3rd party systems. We will provide
Android and iOS SDKs so you can create your own mobile applications.Activity is accessed through a smart application or a web browser where
users can set preferences and control alerts. Users can also:
• Connect other devices and systems to the Monolyth • Set up custom
scenarios, rules, tips & more • Monolyth reads the environment and provides
suggestions and reminders such as: are you going to be out of the house on a
Friday night? Are you planning a trip this Weekend? • Connect all events and
environment changes from Monolyth to all other devices and systems supported by
IFTTT/Zapier. Supported Monolyth events: indoor and outdoor temperature,
humidity, presence, air quality, air pressure, noise level. • Control your
Monolyth (turn ON/OFF, set target temperature) device through IFTTT/Zapier
systems. We are
closely following the possibilities to integrate the Monolyth with HomeKit.
We'll keep you posted on the progress.We are also planning to inregrate the Monolyth with the
SmartThings platform.Real-time push notifications 
To make the device even smarter we added a push notification system for
alerts, tips and reminders for your things such as: 

Air
     quality notification

We are team of dedicated makers, engineers and researchers and we are on a
mission to build the first connected device to make your AC unit smart. We
don’t compromise. We have choose the best sensors available on the market to
sense air quality in your living and working environment. We are using multiple
sensors to measure temperature, humidity, air quality, luminosity, noise and
even atmospheric pressure. Monolyth can measure all the parameters that matters
for your living environment and can also predict weather forecast for your local micro climate.
Then we control. Yes we control your AC unit based on those accurate
measurements. We can control almost any AC unit using array of infrared
emitters built into the Monolyth that can replicate your infrared remote
control. We can also detect your presence based on the state-of-the art
location detection technology, specially developed for Monolyth. Based on the
presence detection, data from the cloud and advanced algorithms, Monolyth can
set optimal parameters for your comfort and energy efficiency.
Monolyth is connected to the internet via your Wi-Fi network. Connection to
the internet allows you to monitor and control your environment from anywhere
in the world.
The first prototype was built using Arduino development platform, IR
receiver and IR emitter. The IR receiver was used to capture IR packets sent
from remote control. Packets were later successfully re-transmitted using IR
emitter. Second prototype was developed using ARM Cortex M0 platform. Due to
additional new sensors (from Freescale, NXP, STM, Murata, etc.) and the
complexity of algorithms used for measurement and presence detection, we had to
use more powerful core, the ARM Cortex M3 platform. In the latest prototype we
also added Wi-Fi module TI CC3000 to the board and enabled Monolyth to become
the internet connected device.
Our team has years of experience developing electronics, so we have designed
latest prototype with component availability and manufacturing process in mind.Production TimelineMonolyth TeamOur vision to make people’s everyday lives more convenient and energy

We’ve already built working prototypes with component availability, price and manufacturing in mind. However, electronic component availability is always a risk. With the alternative components in BOM during the development phase we’ll minimize this risk. We also develop and test hardware in-house, so any changes in design can be made without additional delay.Software development risks:Complete software development is done by our team. We have experience in developing software for embedded systems, web and scalable server applications and also iOS and Android applications. We’re already covering infrared communication codes for over 200 leading brands, but we’re also aware that obtaining additional codes will take a lot of resources.Manufacturing risks:We have spent a considerable amount of time working with our suppliers to come up with the best solutions for our product. Anything from the type of plastic materials for casing to gloss varnish finishing have been already defined. PCBs will be produced and assembled at the certified supplier. Every board will be optically and electrically checked.Supply risks:We have done all the preliminary sourcing and have already made agreements with several manufacturing companies that will provide plastic shells and distributors to source electronics.",31.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Any kind of waste created is a burden on our environment, putting a strain on already precious resources, including water, land, and energy.</p>

</div></div>","We love nature, but realized that when trying to bring nature into our modern homes, they were grown in unnatural environments, with pots made from plastic and other synthetic materials. We wanted a pot for our plants that allowed them to Grow Easily in Nature, so Alphapot was born!
Made from food waste to grow nature, Alphapot is 100% biodegradable, 100% Food Waste Fiber+ Vege Starch + Emulsion, 0% plastic(PP,PET...) 0% bio-plastic(PLA), helping to reduce and repurpose food waste in a more beautiful way.

Any kind of waste created is a burden on our environment, putting a strain on already precious resources, including water, land, and energy.
We often take food for granted and never think twice about our consumption behaviors, but food waste in particular is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, as it typically ends up in landfills or is sent to incinerators, contributing to global warming and climate change. The vicious cycle that is created from the food that we waste each day is astonishing.

What if food waste could be turned into something useful? We believe that more can be done with the food waste created.
Food waste is given a new life when sent to the repurposing factory instead of landfills or incinerators. After going through the processes of mixing, drying, and pressing, a new biodegradable material is born, transforming the vicious food waste cycle into a virtuous one.

No clearing away, no getting up .. and everything would be within easy reach. So we changed the design, made the prototype and my wife and I use it every evening when relaxing after a hard day's work. After consulting furniture experts we had to make a few tweaks to the design to make sure it was s<i>table</i> (excuse the pun!) and a mishap at home showing us that the cushion cover had to be removable and machine washable (I blame the dog!) and the final design concept was completed.  I then put it in the hands of a renowned designer and good friend Tito Ruiz who then turned it into something beautiful.</p><p>I want everyone in the world to enjoy the delight my wife and I have of putting their feet up comfortably in front of the TV … but I need your help.

So we changed the design, made the prototype and my wife and I use it every evening when relaxing after a hard day's work. After consulting furniture experts we had to make a few tweaks to the design to make sure it was stable (excuse the pun!) and a mishap at home showing us that the cushion cover had to be removable and machine washable (I blame the dog!) and the final design concept was completed.  I then put it in the hands of a renowned designer and good friend Tito Ruiz who then turned it into something beautiful.I want everyone in the world to enjoy the delight my wife and I have of putting their feet up comfortably in front of the TV … but I need your help. There is a minimum order to be able to make these tables both eco friendly and cost effectively, and also for the shipping costs. I don’t have tens of thousands to get this off the ground, so I need your support. I'm actually subsidising the price of the first tables out of my own pocket just to get this to as many people as possible. Once I fill my minimum order (the Kickstarter pledge target), I can send these tables on to you and hopefully many more people all over the world. Thank you.What people are saying...... and thousands more!!!!!Shipping costsShipping costs are included to the EU and UK.If you live in remote parts, shipping costs might increase slightly. We will do our best to cover the extra expense from our own pocket, but it might not always be possible.For the US we can ship for 30€. For the rest of the world we have put an approximate charge of 40€ but we will adjust this as necessary once we have the numbers. We are in contact with over 30 fulfillment providers and freight forwarding companies, and have spent weeks analysing the costs,  and how to get the best deal possible for your shipments. It is difficult to know this figure exactly until we know the number sold but we do think we have a pretty good approximation. If we can get it cheaper to your country we will most certainly charge you the lower real price.DimensionsThe table top is 88x46cm closed and 150x46cm open. The height is 51cm. The cushion is 85x45cm and 3cm thick.It weighs less than 30kg....AND DON'T FORGET TO SHARE THIS PAGE.IF YOU HELP US GET TO OUR GOAL, YOU ARE HELPING YOURSELVES GET THE TABLE :DRisks and challengesWe have made every effort to minimise risk. Over 10.000€ of my own savings has already been put into this product to get the design just right, create prototypes, test them, tweak them ... as I wanted to make sure I would be able to fulfill my obligations and promises. I have a fixed price from the manufacturer. They are 100% professional and I have been to their factory and met them in person. They already make furniture for big multinational furniture shops. There should be no unexpected changes.Long-lasting designThe exterior (table top and sizes) are made of solid beach wood, and we haven't skimped on the thickness of the material either. It has been designed to last a long time.Sustainable materialsFSC Certified sustainable materials. 100% of all materials used are ecological and from fully TRACKED sustainable sources.Environmentally friendly factoriesOur factory is in the EU with some of the strictest environmental policies in the world. They adhere to all the regulations.Sustainable DistributionAll packaging is 100% cardboard. The base of the table is lightweight honeycomb which is easier to transport and uses less energy and CO2.Honeycomb structure used in base. This concept is common in the aerospace industry for its strength and lightweight properties and is popular in furniture design. This uses 30% less wood to produce thick panels. Board materials follow strictest formaldehyde emission limits (German DIN EN 16516 or US California CARB P2). All our lacquers are acrylic based, cured with UV light, No solvents used; Solvents are harmful for employees and the environment.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is the OCULUS Security Camera?</h3>
<p>It is a new generation of High Definition, cloud connected, integrated security camera which operates using mains voltage with a built in backup battery. It offers a dropbox style secure upload cloud and a WiFi and 3G/cellular connectivity.</p>

<h3>No recording devices - no maintenance - no installation cost</h3>
<p>Our camera is fully integrated, what that means for you is that you don’t need to worry about lengthy installation, configuration and the vulnerability of the recording being stolen or damaged. The OCULUS Security Camera records and uploads straight to the cloud eliminating the need of a base station.</p>
<h3>No single point of failure</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Power</b>: In case of power failure the built-in battery kicks in allowing the device to operate for about 8 hours extra on a single charge. In turn the system then will issue an alert to your phone anywhere in the world via SMS and email. </li>
<li>
<b>Network</b>: The OCULUS Security Camera is always connected to your wireless network at home however in the event of loss of network connectivity the system will automatically switch to 3G data usage. </li>
<li>
<b>System</b>: The onboard memory of the OCULUS Security Camera is encrypted giving you the extra piece of mind even if the system is compromised.</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
We often buy objects that we don't necessarily need or that we'd like to replace after a few years or months.</p><p>
</p><p> We are influenced by styles, colors and shapes, but everything is decided by someone else.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
That's why I came up with the idea of creating objects that can be customized, that can evolve, change or adjust to a precise moment of our lives and follow our feelings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one to feel this need, therefore ""customizing"" is the main concept I apply to all my projects.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Choosing a lamp can be difficult, we must like it but it'd also fit in the decoration of the room and brighten up the space where it will be located. It's hard to find something we fully like; something that we will be able to appreciate over the years and which can adjust to changes. By simply changing the color of the wall paint, the lamp might look out of place.

<h2><b> The project</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Drop Light is a project developed in ages improving ideas and testing models. The expert people's advices were important when we showed them the first models, the mistakes we made helped to more improve the project, the production difficulties we had were solved optimizing all the process to face requests of future Drop Lights customers. Many little steps had changed from idea to a real project.</p>

<h2><b> Risks and FAQ</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Electrical components such as cable and lamp socket are buyed by CE certified productors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The internal structure is assembled using a cable gland with anti-pull out cable power. Plexiglass components are created in order to avoid  friction cable damages.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>
The equipment electrical cable has Italian plug, for the use of the Light in other countries 
an adapter is needed.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In case of we won't reach the second target, lights will be shipped in a provisional packaging, that's why we haven't, at the moment, dealt research and development costs for a specific packaging.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Spesso capita di comprare oggetti che non sentiamo nostri o che dopo pochi anni, o addirittura mesi, vorremmo cambiare.</p>
<p>Siamo vincolati da stili, colori, forme, tutto deciso da altri.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Da qui nasce la mia esigenze di vivere circondato da oggetti che si possano personalizzare, che possano evolversi, cambiare o addirittura adeguarsi a quel preciso momento della mia vita, seguire le mie emozioni.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
È un'esigenza che sicuramente non sono l'unico ad avere, e la libertà di personalizzazione è diventato il concetto principale che applico a tutti i miei progetti.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
La scelta di una lampada risulta difficile. Oltre a soddisfare il nostro gusto, deve essere in armonia con la stanza in cui la metteremo, illuminare quanto realmente ci serve. È complicato trovare qualcosa che ci aggradi completamente, che nel tempo non perda di interesse e possa adeguarsi ai cambiamenti… un semplice cambio di colore delle pareti potrebbe far risultare la lampada inadeguata. </p>
<p>Drop Light nasce per colmare questo vuoto.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/623390/files/20140603112418-Precius.jpg?1401819858"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>

<h2><b>Design funzionale</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">

<h2><b>Modulare</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Grazie ad una struttura interna principale, sulla quale si avvitano o si incastrano gli elementi decorativi, si ha la possibilità di creare la lampada che realmente vogliamo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Il design modulare di Drop Light offre quindi infinite possibilità di personalizzazione.</p>

<h2><b>Semplice</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Potete modificare la vostra lampada velocemente e con facilità; infatti la particolarità di Drop Light è l'assoluta personalizzazione estetica delle finiture e dei materiali.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In pochi secondi potete variare le componenti estetiche fissate tramite semplici incastri, bottoni in velcro o poche viti.</p>

<h2><b>Made in Italy</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
La possibilità di poter ottenere infinite soluzioni è data dalla realizzazione artigianale di tutte le componenti. La collaborazione con artigiani italiani, che costruiscono i componenti utilizzando i migliori materiali e curando i particolari con grande competenza e qualità, permette infatti assoluta libertà di personalizzazione.</p>

<h2><b>Nessun limite</b></h2>

<h2><b>La campagna su Indiegogo</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Drop Light è un progetto completamente italiano nato in Brianza, un'area geografica della regione Lombardia, a nord di Milano.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In questa zona si vive tra artigianato, design, qualità e professionalità; tutte particolarità che hanno portato le aziende ""brianzole"" nell' eccellenza italiana conosciuta nel mondo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Tale influenza è sempre stata la mia musa ispiratrice, sono sempre spinto dalla voglia di dare la possibilità ad ognuno di avere degli oggetti unici, esclusivi.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622171/files/20140603010431-concept-gram-final_3.jpg?1401782671"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

<h2><b>Obiettivi</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Ad oggi Drop Light è un progetto in start-up; esistono diversi prototipi perfettamente funzionanti, frutto di svariati test e ricerche. Gli stessi sono serviti anche per testare le qualità produttive dei partners che si occupano della realizzazione delle singole parti.</p>

<h2><b>Il progetto</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Drop Light è un progetto che si è sviluppato col passare del tempo, perfezionando le idee e testando i prototipi. Sono stati preziosi i consigli degli esperti a cui abbiamo fatto vedere i primi esemplari, gli errori che sono stati fatti hanno apportato numerosi cambiamenti per migliorare sempre di più il progetto e le problematiche di produzione che abbiamo incontrato sono state risolte ottimizzando tutti i processi per affrontare una richiesta dal futuro pubblico di Drop Light. Tanti piccoli passi che hanno portato ad una conclusione, rendendo uno schizzo su carta un oggetto reale.</p>

<h2><b>Rischi e FAQ</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
I componenti elettrici quali, cavo e portalampada, sono acquistati da produttori che ne certificano la conformità CE.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
La struttura interna è assemblata utilizzando anche un pressacavo/fermacavo con potere antistrappo. Le parti in plexiglass sono lavorate al fine di evitare il danneggiamento del cavo dovuto a sfregamento.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>
Il cavo elettrico in dotazione ha spina italiana, per l'uso in altri paesi è necessario l'uso di un adattatore</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Nel caso non dovessimo raggiungere il secondo obiettivo, le lampade verranno spedite con un packaging provvisorio, in quanto attualmente non abbiamo ancora affrontato i costi di ricerca e sviluppo per la produzione di un imballo specifico.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Leggere imperfezioni delle componenti sono sinonimo di una lavorazione artigianale in cui non vengono utilizzati i processi di industrializzazione e produzione in serie; ogni pezzo è realizzato singolarmente e rifinito a mano.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>Posso utilizzare Drop
Light in tutto il mondo?</b></p>
<p>Drop Light è munita di Europlug, per tutti i paesi in cui si
utilizzano differenti spine è necessario un adattatore.</p>
<p><b>Nei perks è compresa
la lampadina?</b></p>
<p>No, non viene inclusa la lampadina per lasciare libertà di
scelta.</p>
<p><b>Quale lampadina si
deve utilizzare?</b></p>
<p>Il portalampada ha un attacco E27, potete utilizzare il
modello che volete, per le Drop Light chiuse consigliamo l’utilizzo solo di
lampadine a LED.</p>
<p><b>Come calcolo il prezzo
finale del perk?</b></p>
<p>Il prezzo finale è dato dal costo del perk + le spese di
spedizione relative alla vostra area. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b>Se siete residenti in Italia o in Europa dovete aggiungere
anche il 22% di IVA (VAT).</b></span></p>
<p><b>Come posso utilizzare
il buono sconto?</b></p>
<p>Il buono sconto sarà utilizzabile per gli acquisti futuri
direttamente sul sito <a href=""http://www.droplight.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DropLight</a>. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Ogni buono sconto avrà un codice associato alla persona che

Drop Light

We often buy objects that we don't necessarily need or that we'd like to replace after a few years or months.
 We are influenced by styles, colors and shapes, but everything is decided by someone else.

That's why I came up with the idea of creating objects that can be customized, that can evolve, change or adjust to a precise moment of our lives and follow our feelings.

I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one to feel this need, therefore ""customizing"" is the main concept I apply to all my projects.

Choosing a lamp can be difficult, we must like it but it'd also fit in the decoration of the room and brighten up the space where it will be located. It's hard to find something we fully like; something that we will be able to appreciate over the years and which can adjust to changes. By simply changing the color of the wall paint, the lamp might look out of place.

 Drop Light was born to fill in this gap.


Functional design

It's a table lamp, with a simple design, funcional, easy to adapt to every kind of furniture.


Modular

The internal system, in which you can attach decorative elements, allows you to create the lamp 
you really want.

Drop Light modular design so gives you endless customization possibilities.



 Easy 

You can modify your lamp easily and quickly; in fact Drop Light allows you to completely customize finishing and materials.

In a few seconds you can change aesthetic elements attached by simple snap-fits, either Velcro buttons or few screws.



 Unique

We can satisfy any request thus making Drop Light the most unique item on the market.


Made in Italy

The way to obtain infinite solutions is due to the home made production of all parts.
The co-operation with Italian artisans, who model the parts using the best materials and looking after all details with main expertise and quality, allows the extreme customizable design.



 No limits 

My goal is to always study, assess and test new solutions and materials… I want my creativity to have no limits as well as yours… and to give life to multiple solutions of Drop Light.



 The Indiegogo Campaign

Drop Light is an all italian project born in Brianza, a Lombardy geographic area in the northern part of Milano.

In this location people is living among handicraft, design, quality and competence, peculiarities that mean for Brianza's factories the well known Italian excellence in the world.

That influence has
always been my muse, I'm always involved in giving to everyone the possibility
to get unique items.


 Goals

Till today Drop Light is a start up project; there're several fully functional models, result of several tests and researches. The same models served the purpose to test the partners' productive qualities involved in single parts production.

The steps to take on are several and they're necessaries to optimize a product for its safety, quality and functionality.
Now the goals are:
 design set up, tests and realisation capital investment in order to produce the first Drop Light
products for Indiegogo contributors.

If with your campaign contribution will reach this step we'll going to donate the 2% to International ONLUS for children.
 Web, marketing and communication upgrade through:
-  a web project realization with configuration tool and e-commerce
-   digital and paper brochures development
-   packaging design and realization 
-   exhibition events attendance 
-   planning and realization of a plan's communication 
 If with your campaign contribution will reach this step we'll going to donate the 5% to International ONLUS for children.
 New solutions research and development among which a Xmas kit that will be proposed at a discounted price to Indiegogo contributors .
 If with your campaign contribution will reach this step we'll going to donate the 10% to International ONLUS for children.

 Risks and FAQ

Electrical components such as cable and lamp socket are buyed by CE certified productors.

The internal structure is assembled using a cable gland with anti-pull out cable power. Plexiglass components are created in order to avoid  friction cable damages.

The equipment electrical cable has Italian plug, for the use of the Light in other countries 
an adapter is needed.

In case of we won't reach the second target, lights will be shipped in a provisional packaging, that's why we haven't, at the moment, dealt research and development costs for a specific packaging.

Light components' defects means an hand made production and not industrial manufacturing, every item is singularly handmade.FAQ

Drop Light
has got Europlug, in every other country a local adapter is needed.

of the perk. If you are

Drop Light

Spesso capita di comprare oggetti che non sentiamo nostri o che dopo pochi anni, o addirittura mesi, vorremmo cambiare.
Siamo vincolati da stili, colori, forme, tutto deciso da altri.

Da qui nasce la mia esigenze di vivere circondato da oggetti che si possano personalizzare, che possano evolversi, cambiare o addirittura adeguarsi a quel preciso momento della mia vita, seguire le mie emozioni.

È un'esigenza che sicuramente non sono l'unico ad avere, e la libertà di personalizzazione è diventato il concetto principale che applico a tutti i miei progetti.

La scelta di una lampada risulta difficile. Oltre a soddisfare il nostro gusto, deve essere in armonia con la stanza in cui la metteremo, illuminare quanto realmente ci serve. È complicato trovare qualcosa che ci aggradi completamente, che nel tempo non perda di interesse e possa adeguarsi ai cambiamenti… un semplice cambio di colore delle pareti potrebbe far risultare la lampada inadeguata. 
Drop Light nasce per colmare questo vuoto.


Design funzionale

È infatti una lampada da tavolo dal design semplice, funzionale, facile da inserire in ogni contesto di arredamento


Modulare

Grazie ad una struttura interna principale, sulla quale si avvitano o si incastrano gli elementi decorativi, si ha la possibilità di creare la lampada che realmente vogliamo.

Il design modulare di Drop Light offre quindi infinite possibilità di personalizzazione.



Semplice

Potete modificare la vostra lampada velocemente e con facilità; infatti la particolarità di Drop Light è l'assoluta personalizzazione estetica delle finiture e dei materiali.

In pochi secondi potete variare le componenti estetiche fissate tramite semplici incastri, bottoni in velcro o poche viti.



Unica

Possiamo soddisfare ogni vostra richiesta rendendo Drop Light ancora più unica.


Made in Italy

La possibilità di poter ottenere infinite soluzioni è data dalla realizzazione artigianale di tutte le componenti. La collaborazione con artigiani italiani, che costruiscono i componenti utilizzando i migliori materiali e curando i particolari con grande competenza e qualità, permette infatti assoluta libertà di personalizzazione.



Nessun limite

Il mio scopo è quello di valutare, studiare e testare sempre nuove soluzioni e materiali… non voglio mettere limiti alla mia fantasia, alle vostre richieste… alle possibili composizioni finali di Drop Light.



La campagna su Indiegogo

Drop Light è un progetto completamente italiano nato in Brianza, un'area geografica della regione Lombardia, a nord di Milano.

In questa zona si vive tra artigianato, design, qualità e professionalità; tutte particolarità che hanno portato le aziende ""brianzole"" nell' eccellenza italiana conosciuta nel mondo.

Tale influenza è sempre stata la mia musa ispiratrice, sono sempre spinto dalla voglia di dare la possibilità ad ognuno di avere degli oggetti unici, esclusivi.


Obiettivi

Ad oggi Drop Light è un progetto in start-up; esistono diversi prototipi perfettamente funzionanti, frutto di svariati test e ricerche. Gli stessi sono serviti anche per testare le qualità produttive dei partners che si occupano della realizzazione delle singole parti.

Gli step da affrontare sono ancora molti e sono necessari per ottimizzare un prodotto su cui inizialmente è stata curata la sicurezza, la qualità e la funzionalità.
Ora gli obiettivi sono:
copertura del setup di progettazione, test e realizzazione, il tutto per produrre la prima serie di Drop Light destinata ai donatori di Indiegogo.

Se grazie al vostro contributo si arriverà a questo step, sarà intenzione devolvere il 2% ad una ONLUS Internazionale per bambini.
ampliamento del settore web, marketing e comunicazione attraverso:
- realizzazione di un progetto web completo di configuratore ed e-commerce
-  sviluppo brochure digitali e cartacee
-  progettazione e realizzazione packaging
-  partecipazione ad eventi fieristici
-  pianificazione ed attuazione di un piano di comunicazione
Se grazie al vostro contributo si arriverà a questo step, sarà intenzione devolvere il 5% ad una ONLUS Internazionale per bambini.
ricerca e sviluppo di nuove soluzioni tra cui un kit natalizio che sarà proposto ad un prezzo scontato ai donatori di indiegogo
Se grazie al vostro contributo si arriverà a questo step, sarà intenzione devolvere il 10% ad una ONLUS Internazionale per bambini.

Il progetto

Drop Light è un progetto che si è sviluppato col passare del tempo, perfezionando le idee e testando i prototipi. Sono stati preziosi i consigli degli esperti a cui abbiamo fatto vedere i primi esemplari, gli errori che sono stati fatti hanno apportato numerosi cambiamenti per migliorare sempre di più il progetto e le problematiche di produzione che abbiamo incontrato sono state risolte ottimizzando tutti i processi per affrontare una richiesta dal futuro pubblico di Drop Light. Tanti piccoli passi che hanno portato ad una conclusione, rendendo uno schizzo su carta un oggetto reale.



Timeline



Rischi e FAQ

I componenti elettrici quali, cavo e portalampada, sono acquistati da produttori che ne certificano la conformità CE.

La struttura interna è assemblata utilizzando anche un pressacavo/fermacavo con potere antistrappo. Le parti in plexiglass sono lavorate al fine di evitare il danneggiamento del cavo dovuto a sfregamento.

Il cavo elettrico in dotazione ha spina italiana, per l'uso in altri paesi è necessario l'uso di un adattatore

Nel caso non dovessimo raggiungere il secondo obiettivo, le lampade verranno spedite con un packaging provvisorio, in quanto attualmente non abbiamo ancora affrontato i costi di ricerca e sviluppo per la produzione di un imballo specifico.

Leggere imperfezioni delle componenti sono sinonimo di una lavorazione artigianale in cui non vengono utilizzati i processi di industrializzazione e produzione in serie; ogni pezzo è realizzato singolarmente e rifinito a mano.FAQ
Posso utilizzare Drop
Light in tutto il mondo?
Drop Light è munita di Europlug, per tutti i paesi in cui si
utilizzano differenti spine è necessario un adattatore.
Nei perks è compresa
la lampadina?
No, non viene inclusa la lampadina per lasciare libertà di
scelta.
Quale lampadina si
deve utilizzare?
Il portalampada ha un attacco E27, potete utilizzare il
modello che volete, per le Drop Light chiuse consigliamo l’utilizzo solo di
lampadine a LED.
Come calcolo il prezzo
finale del perk?
Il prezzo finale è dato dal costo del perk + le spese di
spedizione relative alla vostra area. Se siete residenti in Italia o in Europa dovete aggiungere
anche il 22% di IVA (VAT).
Come posso utilizzare
il buono sconto?
Il buono sconto sarà utilizzabile per gli acquisti futuri
direttamente sul sito DropLight. Ogni buono sconto avrà un codice associato alla persona che
ha acquistato il perk.
La spedizione è
assicurata?
L’assicurazione sulla spedizione è inclusa per i codici 1, 2
e 3

  According to the EPA, most of us spend 90% of the time indoors where air pollution can be 5 times higher than the air outside. Clean air is no longer something that we can take for granted, not even in our own homes. Each person takes around 23,040 breaths each day yet only 1 out of 10 people have access to clean air! We believe that clean air is a basic human right, not a luxury. That’s why we created Smartmi, an intelligent, affordable air purifier that dramatically improves indoor air quality. AI-powered Purification Using built-in precision laser particulate sensors, Smartmi can continuously collect the surrounding air and analyze the data to perfectly calibrate the proper intensity to filter the air, so that you can breathe easy and save energy. You simply turn it on, sit back and enjoy clean, pure air. Real-time DataSmartmi makes the quality of the air you breathe visibly. The beautiful OLED screen displays the most-up-to-date air quality indexes. Including PM2.5 and TVOC concentration, temperature, humidity, and current operating mode.   High-performing Purification In Any Room Smartmi filters the indoor air at the rate of 400m³/hour, and continuously captures formaldehyde at the rate of 60m³/hour. Designed for spaces as large as 517sq.ft (48㎡), you can put it in any room.   3-stage Smartmi Filter with Antimicrobial Coating The 3-stage filter system of Smartmi is effectively designed to give you triple protection. The preliminary filter traps the most common large particles like dust, fiber, lint, and pet hair. The H13 True HEPA captures most of the airborne particulate down to 0.3 μm like pollen and PM 2.5, while the activated carbon filter absorbs smoke, household odors and TVOCs.w     Know Your Air Quality at A Glance PM2.5 Concentration is the most important particulate metric to measure and control. It is an air pollutant that’s 50 times smaller than an average human hair. It is hard to detect and even harder to capture. But long-term exposure to PM2.5 can cause health issues and affect the quality of life. This is when Halo comes into play, an air quality indicator that changes color based on the current PM2.5 Concentration.  Intuitive Gesture-control Setting up the Smartmi air purifier is as easy as breathing. It has an on-board touch screen and also recognizes gestures for simple, intuitive control.  Smart Voice ControlSmartmi is also compatible with Google Assistant and Alexa products. You can control Smartmi Air Purifier remotely without getting close to it.   With the Mi app, you can take control of your indoor air quality whenever and wherever you choose. The app allows you to smart schedule, track, and monitor air quality in real-time. The App can send you notifications when the air quality indoors becomes unhealthy. You can turn the purifier on using your smartphone remotely to clean the air even if you’re not home so that you can always return to a room of fresh, clean air.  Sleek, modern, and minimalistic, Smartmi discreetly complements any room style. The 360° air intake design creates a circulation airflow pattern that absorbs air pollutants from all angles, leaving no corner of your room unfiltered.

The plan is to start mass production during the campaign and be ready to ship by the end of September 2020. However, we also know that hidden obstacles and challenges often occur. Because of that, we’ve made sure to account for some amount of craziness or unforeseen problems that may occur in our schedule. Some potential risks during processing and assembly testing are expected. If something does go wrong, we promise to keep our backers updated and informed about any issues and about the way in which we are solving them. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach us at hello@zhimi.com",49.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h2>Nuki driver for the BeoLiving Intelligence.</h2>
<p><strong>The Khimo team offers the B&amp;O community the opportunity to endorse the development of a driver to integrate Nuki smart locks into the <a href=""https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/accessories/beoliving-intelligence"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BeoLiving Intelligence</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Following the great initiative shown by the community, this campaign is meant to facilitate the development of the <a href=""https://nuki.io/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nuki smart-locks</a> integration with the BLI. <strong>If we reach the goal, the driver should be ready for use two weeks after receiving the hardware</strong> (we estimate the delivery time to be around one month, but this may vary).</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To develop a great integration experience, we need to get hands-on with the Nuki system. If we raise the <strong>full funds</strong>, 40% of them will go towards the acquisition of the Nuki hardware, this will allow us to create the best driver possible, and respond rapidly to any requests by our users.</p>
<p><strong>Contributors may choose to have early access to the driver</strong>, once it has passed the initial safety and security checks, we will make it available on the BLI you choose, and you will be able to give us feedback and comments on usability.</p>
<h3>Our commitment</h3>
<p><strong>The whole B&amp;O community will have access to the new driver!</strong></p>
<p>We are a small Research and Development team based in Uruguay. We have been working in this area for almost 20 years, and more than 10 years ago we were chosen by Bang &amp; Olufsen to lead their Home Automation endeavor. With <strong>more than 10 years of experience</strong> developing these integrations, you can see our great amount of stable integrations with 3rd party systems <a href=""https://khimo.github.io/help_drivers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. We love providing great <strong>support and assistance</strong> in the case of a user experiencing issues with the software and assure a complete, secure, and stable integration.</p>
<p><strong>The Nuki driver will be implemented by the same team that is behind the BeoLiving Intelligence and BeoLiving App</strong>, we will follow the API (Application Programming Interface) that is backed by the Nuki developers, meaning that as long as they continue to release systems that follow this API, they will be able to integrate with the BLI.

<p>Establishing a sustainable and financially viable renewable energy source, by developing the building blocks for a distributed energy resources grid architecture</p>
<h2>What is Loengen about</h2>
<p>Loengen is a startup company, located in Berkeley CA, committed to bringing practical, environmentally sensible and economically viable, renewable energy production and distribution solutions. Our solution promotes distributed energy generation architecture, supported by self-managed Smart Energy Switches (SES).  We believe that in this way, tax and electricity rate payers will get the most for their money, creating a path to large and sustainable renewable energy production, increasing grid stability and security and investing in local community and businesses.</p>
<h2>Key features of a Smart Energy Switch (SES)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monitor power use at the house and creates a power usage prediction curve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor power production and creates prediction curve of power production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicates with internet, neighboring SESs and central information center,exchanging information. </p>

<li>
<p>Use all data and prediction curves to optimize the control over the local energy storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides real time information to the homeowner on power use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides forecast of power flow and resources availability for the utilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows the house to have power from solar panel and battery when the grid is down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can mitigate effects of fast charging electric car and high concentration of solar panels on the grid, without rebuilding the grid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can function as modular building block of an independent, local micro-grid, replacing the need for centralize grid in remote areas and developing world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support an architecture with a goal that every user produce large portion of energy used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support a renewable energy production that does not require more land</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Creates an alternative to a public investment in a new smart grid that does not provide the benefits listed above</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>Why do we need the prototype</h2>
<p>We've been working, developing the business model, optimization algorithms and connections in the industry and with potential investors, for the last 8 months. Backing of such investors is needed for the product development and deployment. From conversations with potential investors it is clear that a prototype, which demonstrates the device and its basic functions, is important towards securing the needed funds.</p>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>The prototype will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar panels</li>
<li>Inverter that allows both grid-tie and off-grid operation, which can be controlled by our SES</li>
<li>Batteries</li>
<li>Crestron control system and power measuring equipment</li>
<li>Computer connected to the control system, on which all the data analysis, prediction and optimization is done</li>
<li>Relevant software needed for development</li>
<li>Our software (optimization, prediction and control algorithms)</li>
<li>Sample mobile device user interface</li>
</ul><p>The prototype will demonstrate the control on the batteries, will visualize the prediction and optimization to different target behaviors. It will demonstrate the information presented both to homeowners and power utilities.</p>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The two main goals of the project are, to show investors a smart energy server, demonstrate its action and to validate public interest in such a solution.</p>
<p>We will use the money to buy and install the components listed above, run and test our current control software and demonstrate user interface for homeowner and power aggregator.</p>
<h2>Time scale</h2>
<p>From the time we will secure sufficient funds to start a full scale development, we believe it will take about three years for the company to become profitable and start paying the rewards.</p>

<h2><i><strong>A fan based on radical new aircraft propulsion.</strong></i></h2>
<p>Volerian’s room fan is the result of our on-going effort to create quieter, safer, more efficient aircraft. We’re especially interested in building flying cars; aircraft for personal use that can take-off and land anywhere. Since the noise and danger of propellers would limit the use of such aircraft we created a new way of moving air, from first principles.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b73ea2_848fe944ac9c4af29611f614f4effb2c~mv2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It works by oscillating a wing in a specially shaped duct.  The geometry of the parts and the motion was refined using hundreds of computer simulations to increase the efficiency. The wing proximity to the duct walls increases the pressure differences created by the flapping motion and the duct shape and downstream static wings recover energy from vortices produced by the wing motion, which increases the efficiency.</p>
<p> </p>

Volerian’s room fan is the result of our on-going effort to create quieter, safer, more efficient aircraft. We’re especially interested in building flying cars; aircraft for personal use that can take-off and land anywhere. Since the noise and danger of propellers would limit the use of such aircraft we created a new way of moving air, from first principles.

It works by oscillating a wing in a specially shaped duct.  The geometry of the parts and the motion was refined using hundreds of computer simulations to increase the efficiency. The wing proximity to the duct walls increases the pressure differences created by the flapping motion and the duct shape and downstream static wings recover energy from vortices produced by the wing motion, which increases the efficiency.
 
The room fan has many of the qualities we hope our aircraft will soon achieve; safety, quietness, efficiency and style. Buying one now will allow you to experience those benefits sooner, as well as contributing to the development of  aircraft for a better transportation future.

</div><p> </p><p><strong>② <u><i>Espresso to pour-over</i></u></strong> (sufficient 30g capacity, good enough for two coffee lovers) : Grind size and consistency are arguably the two most important elements to brew a perfect cup of coffee of any style; espresso, pour-over, or French Press / cold brew. A good hand grinder should produce consistent grind size and accommodate for all coffee styles. Typical hand grinders attempt to achieve this by adding more components such as roll-bearings on metallic housing and body structure, but this usually result in larger tolerance gaps as well as higher cost of components, lead to highly marked pricing tags.</p><p>Cafflano® Krinder, by contrast, has implemented a maintenance-free slide-bearing system to secure the grind consistency of the center shaft riding on the housing in all ranges.   </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/341/780/abb8cf4bc075d4673fbe47224aedf192_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1583484423&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=650eb1fb45c8f244ecaac0b85211b1f3"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589856418/qsmnf60ju1pgww1xikuu.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>③ <u><i>Metal burrs from the renowned Italian burr specialized company</i></u></strong>: Krinder uses Italian conical metal burr set.

Why Cafflano® Krinder? 
① Effortless grinding : Its compact size and ergonomic design make it easier to grind any type of beans. Inner circular design of Jar makes all grounds out with no residuals. 

 ② Espresso to pour-over (sufficient 30g capacity, good enough for two coffee lovers) : Grind size and consistency are arguably the two most important elements to brew a perfect cup of coffee of any style; espresso, pour-over, or French Press / cold brew. A good hand grinder should produce consistent grind size and accommodate for all coffee styles. Typical hand grinders attempt to achieve this by adding more components such as roll-bearings on metallic housing and body structure, but this usually result in larger tolerance gaps as well as higher cost of components, lead to highly marked pricing tags.Cafflano® Krinder, by contrast, has implemented a maintenance-free slide-bearing system to secure the grind consistency of the center shaft riding on the housing in all ranges.    ③ Metal burrs from the renowned Italian burr specialized company: Krinder uses Italian conical metal burr set. The precision-cut hardened & tempered steel burrs have sharp edge-holding capabilities (edge retention); thus, beans are cut not crushed.  ④ Intuitive and easy grind setting : Easy-to-track numbered Adjusting Wheel. Simply rotate clockwise (finer) or counterclockwise (coarser) to change grind size, with or without the Handle.   ⑤ World's lightest metal burr grinder : only 295g  ⑥ The maximum portability: the Handle is attached and dismantled easily (Knob lock & Crank hook).   ⑦ Affordable and cost-effective price : Retail price is only $99.00. But for you, precious backers, the price of this outperforming Italian metal burr hand grinder is as low as $39.00!  History of Beanscorp, a Cafflano® companySix engineers and marketing specialists in love with coffee founded Beanscorp in 2013, aiming to become unparalleled coffee equipment specialists and started to introduce never-seen-before innovative coffee gears for coffee lovers in the world.

<br/> </h3><h2>FAQs ABOUT GLOBE BY MOMENZZ:</h2><h3> </h3><h3>What is it?</h3><p>GLOBE by momenzz is a beautifully crafted home accessory with a hidden messaging functionality.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>By holding your finger on the heart in the momenzz app, your partner can send his or her heartbeat to GLOBE by momenzz, no matter where he or she is in the world. The Swarovski heart inside the globe begins to pulsate. Touching the Globe sends a message back to the phone.</p><h3>What’s the technology behind the scenes?</h3><p>The Globe is connected to the receiver’s phone via bluetooth, and the two phones communicate with each other just like any other messaging app. A working data connection (mobile or Wifi) is a requirement, of course.</p><p>Can I customise the message that is sent back from the Globe to the phone? If not, what does the message consist of?</p><p>The message is nonverbal and consists of a beautifully designed visual effect that appears on the receiver’s phone.</p><h3>I can’t customise the message? This is quite a one-trick pony product.</h3><p>Humans love simple tools. That’s why we’ve reduced the functionality to the essential. But here’s to the tech lovers: Our hardware allows to go way beyond the current functions. Just bear with us as we further develop our software.</p><h3>How do you charge it?</h3><p>No charging - GLOBE by momenzz runs on two AA batteries, which last for approx. 6 months</p><h3>Do I need a smartphone?</h3><p>Yes, you will need a smartphone that uses bluetooth.</p><h3>Can you hear the heartbeat?</h3><p>The crystal will glow with your heartbeat - there is no sound.</p><h3>Is it the real heartbeat?</h3><p>If you use momenzz via your Apple Watch, you can send your real heartbeat. For smartphones, we use the same method as the iMessenger on the iPhone and send a predefined one. In future releases, you will also be able to send your real heartbeat over the phone. Watch this space...</p><h3>I can do this with my phone on Whatsapp, Facebook, Snapchat…</h3><p>We are all using different communication channels and should not stop doing so! However, we felt they are just not good enough to get emotions across to our loved ones. Our solution to this is GLOBE by momenzz - a connected crystal, which allows for the most personal non-verbal communication. Sometimes we say it best when we say nothing at all.</p><h3>I can do this with my Apple Watch.</h3><p>If you use an Apple Watch, you will, for the first time, be able to send your heartbeat to an object other than an Apple Watch. We felt it would be nice to send the heartbeat to a beautifully crafted home accessory and create a more personal communication channel with a loved one.</p><h3>Why should I buy this?</h3><p>GLOBE by momenzz has it all: its magical, stunning design, high-end materials, and cutting-edge technology inside. It is the perfect gift for a loved one and will create the most personal communication channel.</p><h3>How much is it?</h3><p>Estimated retail price will be around $225. For very early supporters on Indiegogo, we offer a 51% discount, you can pre-order for just $110.</p><h3>Do I need to buy a pair?</h3><p>Nope, there’s no need. If you live together, you’ll keep your GLOBE by momenzz at home in its usual place. Of course, you could buy a pair and, when you travel, take one with you. But as much as we like selling more Globes, we think that’s a bit of an overkill, no? Give the other one to your mum or grandmother, instead and make more people happy. :-)</p><p>If you and your loved one live apart, it’s a great idea to buy a pair and have one in each home. In this case, the communication goes from GLOBE to GLOBE, the app runs seamlessly in the background on both phones.</p><h3>What is it made of?</h3><p>GLOBE by momenzz is created from an exciting combination of materials and cutting edge technology. A smoked glass shell clasps a handcrafted concrete base, enclosing the crystal from Swarovski. Contoured by a rosé gold plated metal inlay, circling the sphere like a ring.</p><h3>How big is it?</h3><p>7.5cm diameter (2.95 inches)</p><h3>Does it bounce?</h3><p>Only if you drop it on a large and well-maintained trampoline. But you’ve just given us a great idea...</p><h3>What if I miss a heartbeat shown on the crystal?</h3><p>You will never miss a heartbeat since the momenzz app will take care of it. Once you get close to the crystal it will glow in a slow mode so that you know that a message is waiting for you. By touching GLOBE by momenzz you will see, what was waiting for you.</p><p>With my other bluetooth devices, most often I have to do the pairing manually, which is a bit of a pain. Will the Globe always pair automatically?</p><p>Yep, we know about that issue. Which is why we’re using special technology to keep this from happening. Your phone will always pair automatically.</p><h3>Who can I give a Globe to?</h3><p>Most of our backers plan to give a GLOBE by momenzz to their romantic partner. But many others want to use it to stay connected to their aging parents or to their children when they are often far away from home.</p><h3>What if I give a Globe to different people?</h3><p>No problem at all. The momenzz app allows you to choose which of your Globes you communicate with.</p><h3>Won’t it just roll off the table? What if I accidentally hit it or if the cat explores it too passionately?</h3><p>The base has a beautiful heaviness to it which gives GLOBE by momenzz a low center of gravity and it stays in place. You’d really have to push it very deliberately for it to roll off the table. If you give it a good push, it rolls once or twice, and then it skews to one side because of the irregular weight distribution.</p><p>And if your Mr Tiddles is dexterous enough to push it deliberately off the table, then this would be such an astonishing display of criminal energy - you probably have bigger problems at that point. Because your cat is probably trying to sabotage your relationship. Or it’s plotting to kill you in your sleep.<br/>If it does fall, however, the Globe might survive a drop from coffee table height onto carpet. Stone and tiles could be trickier.</p></div>","INTRODUCING GLOBE, by momenzz  HEARTFELT CONNECTIONS BEYOND YOUR SMARTPHONEWe live in an age in which  communication has been reduced to short texts, social media likes and overused emojis.

Just bear with us as we further develop our software.How do you charge it?No charging - GLOBE by momenzz runs on two AA batteries, which last for approx. 6 monthsDo I need a smartphone?Yes, you will need a smartphone that uses bluetooth.Can you hear the heartbeat?The crystal will glow with your heartbeat - there is no sound.Is it the real heartbeat?If you use momenzz via your Apple Watch, you can send your real heartbeat. For smartphones, we use the same method as the iMessenger on the iPhone and send a predefined one. In future releases, you will also be able to send your real heartbeat over the phone. Watch this space...I can do this with my phone on Whatsapp, Facebook, Snapchat…We are all using different communication channels and should not stop doing so! However, we felt they are just not good enough to get emotions across to our loved ones. Our solution to this is GLOBE by momenzz - a connected crystal, which allows for the most personal non-verbal communication. Sometimes we say it best when we say nothing at all.I can do this with my Apple Watch.If you use an Apple Watch, you will, for the first time, be able to send your heartbeat to an object other than an Apple Watch. We felt it would be nice to send the heartbeat to a beautifully crafted home accessory and create a more personal communication channel with a loved one.Why should I buy this?GLOBE by momenzz has it all: its magical, stunning design, high-end materials, and cutting-edge technology inside. It is the perfect gift for a loved one and will create the most personal communication channel.How much is it?Estimated retail price will be around $225. For very early supporters on Indiegogo, we offer a 51% discount, you can pre-order for just $110.Do I need to buy a pair?Nope, there’s no need. If you live together, you’ll keep your GLOBE by momenzz at home in its usual place. Of course, you could buy a pair and, when you travel, take one with you. But as much as we like selling more Globes, we think that’s a bit of an overkill, no? Give the other one to your mum or grandmother, instead and make more people happy. :-)If you and your loved one live apart, it’s a great idea to buy a pair and have one in each home. In this case, the communication goes from GLOBE to GLOBE, the app runs seamlessly in the background on both phones.What is it made of?GLOBE by momenzz is created from an exciting combination of materials and cutting edge technology. A smoked glass shell clasps a handcrafted concrete base, enclosing the crystal from Swarovski. Contoured by a rosé gold plated metal inlay, circling the sphere like a ring.How big is it?7.5cm diameter (2.95 inches)Does it bounce?Only if you drop it on a large and well-maintained trampoline. But you’ve just given us a great idea...What if I miss a heartbeat shown on the crystal?You will never miss a heartbeat since the momenzz app will take care of it. Once you get close to the crystal it will glow in a slow mode so that you know that a message is waiting for you. By touching GLOBE by momenzz you will see, what was waiting for you.With my other bluetooth devices, most often I have to do the pairing manually, which is a bit of a pain. Will the Globe always pair automatically?Yep, we know about that issue. Which is why we’re using special technology to keep this from happening. Your phone will always pair automatically.Who can I give a Globe to?Most of our backers plan to give a GLOBE by momenzz to their romantic partner. But many others want to use it to stay connected to their aging parents or to their children when they are often far away from home.What if I give a Globe to different people?No problem at all. The momenzz app allows you to choose which of your Globes you communicate with.Won’t it just roll off the table? What if I accidentally hit it or if the cat explores it too passionately?The base has a beautiful heaviness to it which gives GLOBE by momenzz a low center of gravity and it stays in place. You’d really have to push it very deliberately for it to roll off the table. If you give it a good push, it rolls once or twice, and then it skews to one side because of the irregular weight distribution.And if your Mr Tiddles is dexterous enough to push it deliberately off the table, then this would be such an astonishing display of criminal energy - you probably have bigger problems at that point. Because your cat is probably trying to sabotage your relationship. Or it’s plotting to kill you in your sleep.If it does fall, however, the Globe might survive a drop from coffee table height onto carpet. Stone and tiles could be trickier.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The PillowShelf is absolutely unique, one of those ideas that makes you wonder why no one has done this already.  The unique feature is that it sits under the pillow at the same height as the mattress, undetectable by the user.  It does not affect the existing bed or bedding and can just be slotted in, or permanently fitted to your bed and headboard if required with the included headboard spacers.</p>

<p><strong>Choose your Fabric Colour</strong></p>
<p>All PillowShelfs will be supplied in Naples 100% polyester fabric (BS5852 &amp; BS5651:1978) which is FIRA rated to the highest standard required under current regulations.  You can choose from the following colours with a drop down selection when ordering your PillowShelf</p>

<p><strong>Choose the leg height</strong></p>
<p>The ideal height for your PillowShelf is 1.5 - 2cm (3/4 inch) less than the height of your mattress.  One of the winning elements of the PillowShelf is that it comes with 6 inches (15cm) of adjustment to its height on each of the three height versions available.  Even if you change your bed or mattress, or if your mattress settles, you can adjust the PillowShelf so that it is undetectable to the sleeper.  </p>
<p>Most beds fall into the standard height category so unless you know you have a very low or very tall bed, order the standard height leg (a drop down menu will appear on the order page which states actual heights per version). </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We will be contacting purchasers at the end of this crowdfunding campaign to confirm size and colour choices so don’t worry about reaching for the measuring tape just now.  You can place your order with confidence knowing that we will ensure you receive the correct PillowShelf for your bed.</strong></p>

<h3>More about the PillowShelf</h3>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9StZVhqDoI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">See just how simple it is to install the PillowShelf</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The PillowShelf is the first of a range of Bedstretch ideas and at present it only works with Divan Beds (so not beds with frames).  </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The PillowShelf Story</h3>
<p>We created the first PillowShelf four years ago. Martin absolutely hates his toes hanging off the end of a bed, to the extent that he will wake up throughout the night if that's the case.  Kris dislikes the weight of the duvet dragging across her feet as they near the end of the bed.</p>
<p>When we got together five years ago, we bought a big superking divan bed, but by the time we allowed for the space above our heads on the pillow and the few inches taken up by the headboard, Martin's toes would work their way down and off the mattress during the night.  After a few weeks of keeping Kris awake, we came up with the idea of creating a shelf to support the top of the pillow which would allow us to sleep higher up the bed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528876199/f0zprpx4lgalcdyztggl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This truly simple solution meant that we kept the same bed and all the same bedding (no need for additional new expensive sheets and duvet covers). Nothing else changed - but now we have a massive seven foot long sleeping space.  It was so simple that we thought no more of it until last year when we got married and a tall friend stayed at our house and mentioned what a fantastic and unique idea it was.</p>
<p>After much research, we found that there was nothing like it already on the market and we set about creating a version that we could mass produce.  Even though we had a version that worked in our room, we didn't have anything free standing or transportable or for beds of a different size. </p>
<p>Transportability became a focus as we identified its many and varied uses and we could see its potential as an excellent Christmas gift for the special people in our lives.  Literally, we realised that if we could provide a portable, adjustable and completely independent solution that could be installed and removed in minutes with no changes to the bed, we would have a winner for taller people everywhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Uses for the PillowShelf</h3>
<p>The cost of new bedding sets are very expensive so why go to the expense of a new bed and new bedding.  Keep your existing bed and add a PillowShelf.</p>
<p>Because the PillowShelf is so easy to install, remove and transport, you can:</p>
<p>·         Use it to extend the bed in your master bedroom. </p>
<p>·         Use it in the spare room to convert a 6'3""bed into a 6'9"" bed for your favourite guests or relatives.</p>
<p>·         Make your teenager’s bed six inches longer as their feet grow out the end of their existing bed.</p>
<p>·         Take it away to relatives, set it up in a few minutes and turn that old cramped bed into a luxury sleeping space</p>
<p>·         Take it with you to hotels, hostels, universities etc</p>
<p>Because you may not be able to fit a bigger bed up the stairs in your house, the PillowShelf allows you to select any bed in the shop and still give yourself a longer sleeping space.</p>
<p>If your bedroom isn’t large enough for a bigger bed the PillowShelf can be slotted it in at night and take out again in the morning with ease, allowing you to benefit from a longer bed when it matters.</p>
<p>The uses of a PillowShelf are almost endless .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .</p>

<p>You don't need to fit a headboard, but the headboard spacers allow you to attach the PillowShelf even with a headboard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528413335/gypenz1hsbueh2ijb58m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In one of our many trials, the couple had a combination bed consisting of two, 2 foot 6 inch electronic adjustable divan bases, which were only available as 6'3"" long models.  The addition of a 5 foot (150cm) PillowShelf created a massive 6'9"" sleeping area.  If you have an extra tall headboard as with this setup, additional PillowShelf headboard spacers are available, to allow you to create the four secure connections required for the headboard.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
<p>We have taken the Pillowshelf through several design iterations during our journey to date. The final version which is now ready for production provides five sizes for the five standard bed widths.  They are all available in three different height groups, depending on the height of your bed from floor to top of mattress. When you buy a PillowShelf during this campaign, you get to select one of the five colours that we have identified for these batches. </p>
<p>We will sanction the build of at least 1000 PillowShelf units at the end of the Indiegogo campaign regardless of how many orders we receive, but your order will help us decide which sizes and which colours are most popular.</p>
<p>Included with your order will be the PillowShelf, a carry bag, a fitted sheet and a pair of headboard spacers together with full simple to follow fitting instructions.  You may wish to order a spare set of headboard spacers if you have an extra tall headboard, and you may wish to order additional sheets, although all of these will be available from our website by August.  We have undertaken to deliver all orders within eight weeks of the end of the campaign, and your entire order will be delivered to your door in a neatly packaged cardboard box.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Future for the PillowShelf</h3>
<p>This campaign and your support for it will enable us to scale up our production and sales in a controlled manner as we will have pre-orders to identify the most popular sizes and colours.  </p>
<p>Once the campaign completes we will instigate a direct sales portal from our website (<a href=""http://www.bedstretch.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bedstretch.co.uk</a>) and bring this, and over time, alternative designs together with matching headboards and divan bases to the wider public.</p>
<p>We will continue to look at ways to move forward with our product following the latest innovations in design durability and sustainability and we will be listening to you, our customers, so any ideas or comments you may have will be gratefully received and can be forwarded to ideas@bedstretch.co.uk.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How we will deal with your Order</h3>
<p>The Indiegogo campaign closes on 21st July 2018 at which time we will send you an email confirming our expected delivery schedule and listing the size and colours that have been ordered.  If you wish to change the colour or leg size (or even the size of the PillowShelf selected) then you will be given the option at this stage. </p>
<p>We have promised to ensure delivery to you within an eight week period so you can have full confidence in the integrity of Bedstretch Ltd and our promise to you.  </p>
<p>We will keep you informed of progress of our build schedule in relation to your specific order and will update you with any relevant information as it arises.  Nearer to shipment we will let you know the shipment date, carrier details and expected delivery date.  </p>

""it immediately made the bed longer, even the dog had more room to curl up at the end of the bed!  We loved the extra room and were thrilled we could keep our own bed "" 
""We already had a big bed, but our guest bed is now a massive 6'9"", never been so popular""
 


 

The PillowShelf is absolutely unique, one of those ideas that makes you wonder why no one has done this already.  The unique feature is that it sits under the pillow at the same height as the mattress, undetectable by the user.  It does not affect the existing bed or bedding and can just be slotted in, or permanently fitted to your bed and headboard if required with the included headboard spacers.
 
MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
We are so sure that you will be delighted with this product that we will give you back your money if you are not.  We will contact you at the end of July to confirm the required size, leg height and colour.  We will deliver the product within eight weeks and if you're not completely satisfied you can return it within fourteen days for a full refund.
 
Why Crowdfund with Perks
We will be producing the PillowShelf in quantity in August, ready for shipment in September.  The designs are ready to roll but we have no idea which fabric colours or sizes will be more or less popular so it would be easy to get the colours and sizes wrong.

3 foot (90cm),  4 foot (120cm),  4 foot 6 inch (135cm),  5 foot (150cm) and 6 foot (180cm)
Delivered in its own bag for storage and transport, it is also provided with two standard headboard spacers, and a fitted sheet.  Additional headboard spacers for tall headboards and additional fitted sheets are also available to order separately with this campaign.

Choose your size
Select the 3 foot perk for a 3 foot PillowShelf (or 2 foot 6"")
Select the Earlybird perk for all other sizes.

 
Choose your Fabric Colour
All PillowShelfs will be supplied in Naples 100% polyester fabric (BS5852 & BS5651:1978) which is FIRA rated to the highest standard required under current regulations.  You can choose from the following colours with a drop down selection when ordering your PillowShelf

Choose the leg height
The ideal height for your PillowShelf is 1.5 - 2cm (3/4 inch) less than the height of your mattress.  One of the winning elements of the PillowShelf is that it comes with 6 inches (15cm) of adjustment to its height on each of the three height versions available.  Even if you change your bed or mattress, or if your mattress settles, you can adjust the PillowShelf so that it is undetectable to the sleeper.  
Most beds fall into the standard height category so unless you know you have a very low or very tall bed, order the standard height leg (a drop down menu will appear on the order page which states actual heights per version). 
We will be contacting purchasers at the end of this crowdfunding campaign to confirm size and colour choices so don’t worry about reaching for the measuring tape just now.  You can place your order with confidence knowing that we will ensure you receive the correct PillowShelf for your bed.
 
ITS AS SIMPLE AS THAT - A HUGE DISCOUNT and A MASSIVE THANKYOU
 
 
More about the PillowShelf
 

See just how simple it is to install the PillowShelf
The PillowShelf is the first of a range of Bedstretch ideas and at present it only works with Divan Beds (so not beds with frames).  
 
The PillowShelf Story
We created the first PillowShelf four years ago. Martin absolutely hates his toes hanging off the end of a bed, to the extent that he will wake up throughout the night if that's the case.  Kris dislikes the weight of the duvet dragging across her feet as they near the end of the bed.
When we got together five years ago, we bought a big superking divan bed, but by the time we allowed for the space above our heads on the pillow and the few inches taken up by the headboard, Martin's toes would work their way down and off the mattress during the night.  After a few weeks of keeping Kris awake, we came up with the idea of creating a shelf to support the top of the pillow which would allow us to sleep higher up the bed.

This truly simple solution meant that we kept the same bed and all the same bedding (no need for additional new expensive sheets and duvet covers). Nothing else changed - but now we have a massive seven foot long sleeping space.  It was so simple that we thought no more of it until last year when we got married and a tall friend stayed at our house and mentioned what a fantastic and unique idea it was.
After much research, we found that there was nothing like it already on the market and we set about creating a version that we could mass produce.  Even though we had a version that worked in our room, we didn't have anything free standing or transportable or for beds of a different size. 
Transportability became a focus as we identified its many and varied uses and we could see its potential as an excellent Christmas gift for the special people in our lives.  Literally, we realised that if we could provide a portable, adjustable and completely independent solution that could be installed and removed in minutes with no changes to the bed, we would have a winner for taller people everywhere.
 
Uses for the PillowShelf
The cost of new bedding sets are very expensive so why go to the expense of a new bed and new bedding.  Keep your existing bed and add a PillowShelf.
Because the PillowShelf is so easy to install, remove and transport, you can:
·         Use it to extend the bed in your master bedroom. 
·         Use it in the spare room to convert a 6'3""bed into a 6'9"" bed for your favourite guests or relatives.
·         Make your teenager’s bed six inches longer as their feet grow out the end of their existing bed.
·         Take it away to relatives, set it up in a few minutes and turn that old cramped bed into a luxury sleeping space
·         Take it with you to hotels, hostels, universities etc
Because you may not be able to fit a bigger bed up the stairs in your house, the PillowShelf allows you to select any bed in the shop and still give yourself a longer sleeping space.
If your bedroom isn’t large enough for a bigger bed the PillowShelf can be slotted it in at night and take out again in the morning with ease, allowing you to benefit from a longer bed when it matters.
The uses of a PillowShelf are almost endless .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 

See just how quick and easily the PillowShelf is installed - even in the garden!

You don't need to fit a headboard, but the headboard spacers allow you to attach the PillowShelf even with a headboard.
 

In one of our many trials, the couple had a combination bed consisting of two, 2 foot 6 inch electronic adjustable divan bases, which were only available as 6'3"" long models.  The addition of a 5 foot (150cm) PillowShelf created a massive 6'9"" sleeping area.  If you have an extra tall headboard as with this setup, additional PillowShelf headboard spacers are available, to allow you to create the four secure connections required for the headboard.
 
Where We Are Now
We have taken the Pillowshelf through several design iterations during our journey to date. The final version which is now ready for production provides five sizes for the five standard bed widths.  They are all available in three different height groups, depending on the height of your bed from floor to top of mattress. When you buy a PillowShelf during this campaign, you get to select one of the five colours that we have identified for these batches. 
We will sanction the build of at least 1000 PillowShelf units at the end of the Indiegogo campaign regardless of how many orders we receive, but your order will help us decide which sizes and which colours are most popular.
Included with your order will be the PillowShelf, a carry bag, a fitted sheet and a pair of headboard spacers together with full simple to follow fitting instructions.  You may wish to order a spare set of headboard spacers if you have an extra tall headboard, and you may wish to order additional sheets, although all of these will be available from our website by August.  We have undertaken to deliver all orders within eight weeks of the end of the campaign, and your entire order will be delivered to your door in a neatly packaged cardboard box.
 

The Future for the PillowShelf
This campaign and your support for it will enable us to scale up our production and sales in a controlled manner as we will have pre-orders to identify the most popular sizes and colours.  
Once the campaign completes we will instigate a direct sales portal from our website (www.bedstretch.co.uk) and bring this, and over time, alternative designs together with matching headboards and divan bases to the wider public.
We will continue to look at ways to move forward with our product following the latest innovations in design durability and sustainability and we will be listening to you, our customers, so any ideas or comments you may have will be gratefully received and can be forwarded to ideas@bedstretch.co.uk.
 

How we will deal with your Order
The Indiegogo campaign closes on 21st July 2018 at which time we will send you an email confirming our expected delivery schedule and listing the size and colours that have been ordered.  If you wish to change the colour or leg size (or even the size of the PillowShelf selected) then you will be given the option at this stage. 
We have promised to ensure delivery to you within an eight week period so you can have full confidence in the integrity of Bedstretch Ltd and our promise to you.  
We will keep you informed of progress of our build schedule in relation to your specific order and will update you with any relevant information as it arises.  Nearer to shipment we will let you know the shipment date, carrier details and expected delivery date.

About FirstBuild


FirstBuild is a co-creation community that is changing the way products come to market by working with our community from the very beginning. Prisma is the culmination of more than a year of design challenges, late-night coffee tastings, and heated debates; all pointing us to this new and compelling opportunity of rapid cold brew coffee.
Backed by GE Appliances, we have access to world-class design and engineering talent. Since our inception 2 years ago, we have sold over $3 million in product on Indiegogo, and we look forward to another successful campaign.

Frequently Asked Questions
How does Prisma work?Traditionally, cold brew coffee is brewed on the counter or in the fridge by steeping coarse ground coffee in water for 12 or more hours. Prisma speeds up the process through a specialized vacuum infusion process. We recommend using fresh roasted, fine ground coffee for the best results. 

How do I operate Prisma? 
We studied the entire range of cold brew devices to understand the current user experience and make it better. Prisma is simple: 


Add finely ground coffee and water to the brew chamber at your desired ratio. 
Press button to begin vacuum infusion. 
Eight minutes later, delicious cold brew automatically drains into the carafe. 



How do I clean Prisma? 

Prisma was designed for cleanability. After running a brew cycle: 


 Slide the brew chamber off. 
 Discard the used filter and grounds. 
Rinse the brew chamber and the filter retainer ring. 



What type of filter does Prisma use? 
Filters for Prisma are inexpensive and easy to find. Prisma uses a standard basket filter, the kind used in commercial coffee makers. We recommend the Bunn filter found here. 
Do you have more detailed feature information? 



Output (at 8:1 brew ratio): 700 mL (23.7 oz) or approximately (4) 6-oz. cups

Carafe Material: Glass

Size: At under 17.5” Prisma fits underneath most cabinets

Power: Prisma can be plugged into any standard 120V outlet

How much coffee does Prisma make in a single batch?

 Water: 1000 mL (34 oz)
Coffee Grounds: 125 g (4.5 oz)
Cold Brew Coffee: 700 mL (24 oz)

<p>A label that says sheets are <strong>100% cotton</strong> describes the material. Yet, its quality is given by the <strong>length of the cotton fibers</strong> which are classified as short/medium (1.0 to 2.5 cm) and long (3.0 to 6.0 cm) staple cotton. These length differences may seem small, but they make <strong>a huge difference</strong> in the <strong>quality, strength, and softness</strong>. Most cheap and basic cotton sheets are made from short staple cotton which is commonly inexpensive but it is quite rough and less durable. That's the reason why <strong>we only use long stable fibers</strong> for our bedsheets.</p>

<p>The <strong>quality </strong>of finite cotton craft is given by the <strong>TC </strong>(Thread Count=<strong>number of thread woven</strong> into a square inch of fabric), and is linked to the fiber length, since the longer the fiber, the thinner the yarn, and more threads will fit in the same area. Basic sheets are anywhere between 80 and 120 TC;<strong> high quality</strong> starts from 180 TC to 300 TC; TC &gt;300 are either very expensive (&gt;800 € a set) or deceptive (they are counting fibers, not actual threads). <strong>Our sheets</strong> are made of <strong>high quality cotton 300 TC</strong></p>

Isn’t it about time we have a remote control for your lights? AirON is a smart inexpensive add-on to your existing switch. AirON connects your smartphone to your switch and gives you control over your lights from your phone. AirON flips the switch for you wirelessly with its internal gear. Now lighting is at your fingertips!
As seen in 





Media report

Currently the switch supports iOS devices with Bluetooth 4.0 (iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, iPhone 4S, new iPad, New Touch, iPad Mini). It also works on Android 4.3 OS and above phones with support for Bluetooth 4.0.

Hassle-free installation! 
Ever want to upgrade your switch in the wall-plate but troubled by those messy unlabeled wires behind the wall? AirON keeps your existing switch unchanged.

With a dedicated interior electro-mechanical gear (provisional patent in place), AirON works with either standard toggle switch or rocker switch. Since you will be only changing the cover, you don't need to worry about anything behind the wall.



Installation is incredibly easy!
AirON is now available in single-panel version and double-panel version for 1-gang box and 2-gang box installation, respectively.

<h2><strong>BopPad - Expressive Smart Drum Pad</strong></h2>
<p>BopPad is the expressive electronic drum pad for drummers, percussionists and producers. BopPad gives you accurate hit detection (2.4 millisecond latency), velocity, continuous radius and pressure. Four independently programmable zones output MIDI notes, velocity, pitch bend, pressure and location CCs.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476750813/noiug2uhspgfuzqqvfsp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>BopPad has an extremely wide dynamic range and measures strike velocity from the softest hand drumming to the most brutal percussive assault. A robust tuned elastomer surface covers a 10” circle of our patented Smart Sensor Fabric to give you traditional feel and a new dimension of expressivity.</p>
<p>BopPad can also operate as a conventional practice pad with a realistic feel and portable, lightweight design.</p>
<h3>Artists Love BopPad</h3>
<p>We were able to send prototype BopPads out to some incredible artists to get their insight and impressions. We're continuing to work with the best drummers to fine-tune BopPad's performance; stay tuned for updates!</p>

TRIDO® IN THE MEDIA 

 
WHAT MAKES TRIDO® UNIQUE?
It comes down to these things:
 TRIDO® IS PATENTED  

 
For TridoⓇ we utilize multiple powerful neodymium magnets on each side of each shape. IS TRIDO® FOR CHILDREN OR ADULTS?YES and YES! TRIDO is a toy for all ages, perfect for any number of uses, including fidgeting, relaxation, idea boosting, and playtime. You can play with TRIDO on your own or in a group, and you can even invent your own TRIDO uses. For example imagine playing magnetic Jenga with it!The play is not just essential for kids; it can be an important source of relaxation and stimulation for adults as well. Playing is a sure and fun way to fuel your imagination, creativity, problem-solving abilities, abstract thinking and emotional well-being.TRIDO will unleash the world of 3D geometry right before your very eyes. 

 

Children can explore concepts in science, geometry and math, while they develop motor skills, reasoning, and dimensional and spatial thinking. But most importantly, they'll have fun while doing it. 
 You can always find your own way to play with TRIDO as we assume there are plenty of amusement things we haven’t thought about.  Creating stuff with TridoⓇ is easy and satisfying

When you heat frozen foods the ice crystals melt and usually collect as water around the bottom of the food, with an SRT this is instantly drained away and the air is free to circulate and heat the underside – the result is perfectly cooked, crispy all round delicious food – and importantly , no more soggy bottoms.Chicken wings, nuggets, spare ribs even bread with great results even from frozen. When is a roasting tray not just a roasting tray?Being engineers we like to think about things from all angles, so we asked the question can it work in the opposite way - instead of the perforated plate functioning as an effective drain system, can we use it in reverse?Wow, yes you can!.it works fantastically well as an aromatizing system.Placing vegetables and a little water or white wine or even a dark beer in the lower tray provides a beautiful aroma infusion as the food is cooked on the upper tray– this is spectacularly good for fish dishes. Not only that but after cooking, open the drain tap and collect the liquid as a perfect base to prepare a sauce that perfectly complements the infused aroma. The built-in filter/sieve helps separate the sauce base liquid from the solids. Simple, no fuss, no messYou can take the tray directly from the oven to the dining table and thanks to the tough enamelled top plate you can carve up your roast or serve your fish directly from the tray to the plate.Less clean upRoasting foods even when frozen usually involves placing the food on or in aluminium foil or roasting paper, this is wasteful, additional cost and mess and not exactly eco-friendly.

<p></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey folks, I am Marco Schwartz, CEO &amp; Founder of Open Home Automation, where we teach people how to build home automation systems using Open-Source Hardware.</p>
<p>We recently published a series of articles concerning projects that connects to the web using the CC3000 WiFi chip by TI, and we saw that there is a growing interest from the community for this kind of projects and also for the idea of connecting Arduino-based projects to the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>However, actually adding the WiFi connectivity to your projects can be tricky. You can use nice breakout boards, or Arduino shields, but it means you always have to add something else to all of your projects.</p>
<p>But wait ... what if your main board already had an integrated WiFi connectivity ? This is exactly what we want to address with this project: propose an Arduino compatible board, using the same format as the Arduino Uno, with the CC3000 WiFi chip integrated on the board.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/163580/files/20131030063109-page_pic.jpg?1383139869"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Based on the Arduino Uno design, it has exactly the same features as the Arduino Uno board and therefore this board is compatible with most of the already existing shields for Arduino, so you don't have to stack up many shield to integrate your project into an Internet of Things framework. And of course, the board is completely open-source!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already made significant progress on this project. We experimented a lot with the CC3000 chip and used it in a wide range of applications, <a href=""http://openhomeautomation.net/internet-of-things-arduino-wifi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">connecting sensors directly to the Internet</a>, <a href=""http://openhomeautomation.net/wireless-relay-arduino-wifi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">commanding relays wirelessly</a>, and even <a href=""http://openhomeautomation.net/wireless-camera/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">interfacing cameras wirelessly with a web server</a>. The software of the WiFi chip is also not an issue as many libraries exist for Arduino.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/163194/files/20131029234949-IMG_7693.jpg?1383115789"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We also have the schematics, layout, and Gerber files ready, and we are currently on our way to produce the first prototypes. With our experience in PCB design and our successes with the projects using the CC3000 chip, we are confident that there will be no problem producing this board. We also have a manufacturer ready to produce the boards in large quantities for this campaign and deliver the product on time. We basically just need your help to actually start producing the boards in large quantities.</p>

<p></p>
<p>What you will get at the end is quite simple: the board fully assembled, which is an Arduino Uno compatible board with integrated WiFi connectivity. As the project is fully open-source like everything we do at Open Home Automation, the sources (schematics &amp; layout) for the board will also be available for everyone.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will have a significant impact on the makers &amp; open-source hardware communities. Indeed, the Internet of Things is a growing topic among makers and having an Arduino compatible board with the same form factor as the Arduino Uno will allow people to prototype their Internet of Things projects much faster.</p>
<p>We already have a solid experience with the CC3000 chip and Arduino as we made several projects based on these technologies. This board was designed with home automation applications in mind, but of course it can be used in many other fields, for example in industrial applications and robotics.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>Why buy this board and not an Arduino Yun ?</b></p>
<p>Excellent question. The Arduino Yun is an excellent board that also comes with integrated WiFi at a reasonable price point. However, we know that many people want to experiment specifically with the CC3000 WiFi chip because it is so easy to integrate later into custom designs &amp; final products. We see our board more like a complement to the Arduino line than a competitor of the Arduino Yun.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute directly, don't worry! You can still help us out but adding some comments on the campaign and giving us feedback on the project, and of course by spreading out the word to your friends &amp; colleagues so we can make this project a reality!</p>

<h3><b>Our story</b></h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Gordon Hamilton and
I'm the creator of the Torsorest, or ""mini flight bed"" concept.</p>
<p>During my business life I was
privileged to travel the world. Twenty years ago it used to amuse and puzzle me
that on arrival, even in business class and paying thousands of dollars, the
cabin looked more like a camp site after a music festival and the passengers
looked equally dishevelled. People just seemed to put up with it.</p>
<p>What they were putting up with was a
rapid change in the way we live our lives. Over the last 50 years, and
certainly since the problem accelerated with the flight of the first jumbo-jet
40 years ago, millions of us are now expected to spend more and more of our
travel time confined to a seat.</p>
<p>Things may have improved for the
business class traveller but not for the 91% of us who ride in the back.</p>
<p>With our increasingly hectic
lifestyle and our longer and longer multi-modal journeys you would expect the
opportunity to sit down, mid journey, and rest or sleep for a few hours might
be welcomed. Sadly this is not the case. 100% of passengers trying to sleep
while confined to a seat reported it was the worst part of their journey.</p>
<p>I’ve seen the same phenomenon on long
distance rail and coach journeys and even as a passenger on long car journeys. </p>
<p>One particularly bad twenty four hour
coach journey inspired me to figure out what was wrong and do something about
it.</p>
<p>I started to think about the problem
from first principles – what makes sleeping in a bed comfortable? And, how
could I replicate that experience in a seat?</p>
<p>The essence of sleeping on a bed is
that all the articulated body parts (head, torso, arms, legs) are supported
independently, resulting in almost zero strain on the articulating connections
(neck, spine, joints). A secondary benefit of the independent support of body
parts is that the sleeping person can move easily, to relieve stiffening
joints, without having to consciously wake up. If you have ever watched time
lapse photography of someone sleeping on a bed you'll realise how much we need
to be able to move even during sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/104490/files/20130930132753-stick1.gif?1380572873"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span>...the ideal sleeping position</span></blockquote>
<p>Contrast this with trying to sleep in
a seat. Here the effect of gravity on the body parts causes them to collapse down
creating massive strain on the articulating connections: the neck, the spine
and all the other joints. Not to mention concentrating all your upper body
weight on your lower body, buttocks and thighs.</p>
<p>So, the solution lay in finding a way
to support, INDEPENDENTLY, those body parts that were unsupported in a seat,
namely the head, upper torso, and arms.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/104496/files/20130930132840-stick2.gif?1380572920"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span>...as good as the ideal?</span></blockquote>
<p>My
solution, which you can deduce from the diagrams, is a unique product called
the Torsorest, or ‘<b><span>Mini Flight Bed’</span></b>, and is a free
standing platform that supports the waist, chest, neck and
head, INDEPENDENTLY.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/104519/files/20130930133409-KD_torsorest_on_airline_seat_pencil_539x600-tile_green.jpg?1380573249"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<blockquote>...the
solution. We think so. (sketch not to scale)</blockquote>
<p>The torsorest delivers a highly
effective sleep position with natural posture and well balanced weight
distribution (half your weight is removed from your buttocks and thighs). It is
lightweight, folds flat and occupies approx. 7% of passenger hand luggage.</p>
<p>It has an added bonus in that it also
allows some free movement of joints while sleeping and provides an important
alternative sleep position.</p>
<p><i>IN SHORT, IT MIMICS CLOSELY ALL THE BENEFITS OF SLEEPING IN A BED</i>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Further refinement of the concept</b></p>
<p>Having established the freestanding
platform concept, requiring an extending front leg, you can anticipate the next
step; why not use the extending handle of a wheelie bag for the leg, in fact
why not incorporate the Torsorest into the hand-luggage, so that it is always
with you when you travel and can be detached when needed. </p>
<p>Here are the early concepts:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/104544/files/20130930134321-Concept_TR_sketch_1-crop-green.jpg?1380573801"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3><b>These early designs and prototypes have shaped our
journey. </b></h3>
<p>Both
prototypes have travelled the world but more importantly they have proved the
concept with both <b><span>consumer focus groups and a university based
medical study.</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<b>Market research</b><b>:</b>
</h3>
<p>- 40% would <i>“buy it now”</i> if it were in stores, the rest were very interested to
see the final product. This level of interest in the torsorest confirms the
fact that 100% of travellers find trying to sleep when confinement to a seat
the worst part of their journey. They want a solution, a solution that is long
overdue.</p>
<h3>
<b>Medical study</b><b>:</b>
</h3>
<p>“…<i><span>The forward resting position adopted with the Mini Flight Bed,
appears to reduce the lumbar lordosis (</span></i>unnatural curvature of the
spine)<i> … whilst at the same time mitigating compression and shear
forces by supporting the weight of the spine and upper body</i>…”</p>
<p>“… <i><span>support against the anterior chest may facilitate relaxation of
the erector spine muscle group and therefore reduce back pain or discomfort</span></i>…”</p>
<p><b>...they
concluded:</b></p>
<p>“<i><span>The opinion of the team is that the Mini Flight Bed has
significant potential to improve comfort or reduce discomfort … by facilitating
an alternative rest position with upper body support.""</span></i></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h2><b><i>How does it work in practice?</i></b></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/104629/files/20130930141414-Storyboard_3x3_tile.jpg?1380575654"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<blockquote><span>…step by step, it's so easy and sooo
comfortable</span></blockquote>
<p><b></b></p>
<h2><b><i>We didn't get
here by accident</i></b></h2>
<p>A lot of research went
into fitting the solution to the harshest seating environment - aircraft:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/104648/files/20130930142433-IMG-tile.jpg?1380576273"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<blockquote><span>...if it fits in aircraft, it will fit any mode of transport; rail, coach,
or car</span></blockquote>
<p>Most long haul aircraft have the
longer legroom but the torsorest will adapt to even the smallest seating
arrangement in budget airlines. Merely adjust the torsorest to its steepest
setting and you'll be amazed at how much support it continues to provide. If
the seat in front reclines you can adjust the torsorest to a higher setting. In
fact, the reclined seat acts almost as an extension of your head resting area
(an unexpected bonus).</p>
<h2><b>Anecdotes</b></h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Cabin crew report that up to 20% of
passengers already attempt to sleep by leaning forward on to their food trays.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Cabin crew also intimated that the
torsorest would be good for them too. Evidently, they often have to wait in
terminals between jobs, sometimes for long periods. The torsorest would help
them to make use of that 'downtime' by getting some proper sleep. They would
like to see it stocked in their 'Crew Outlet' stores. <br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">This highlights that the torsorest could be useful to anyone stranded in
transit by unforeseen events - missed flights, bad weather, volcanic ash clouds
– you know, the stuff that always happens to you!</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>What are our objectives</b></h2>
<ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Design a super slim, super lightweight version of the prototype
torsorest. In your hand it will feel like your handling the head of a

<p>Our first reward, a production
example of our latest design of the torsorest, 'mini flight bed' is now being
manufactured for final approval. Some representations of the CAD designs are
shown here. Full imagery can be seen on our website <a href=""http://www.torszo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.torszo.com</a> . This is the slim lightweight version that slips easily into your
shoulder bag or cabin luggage. You only have to try it once and it will become
the first thing you want to pack for any journey.</p>
<p>Far sighted supporters who choose the
VISIONARY rewards will enjoy the lightweight version now PLUS a yet to be

the torsorest, 'mini flight bed' integrated into cabin luggage. This means it
will be with you where ever and whenever you need it. </p>
<p>We are aiming to design at least two
versions of the cabin luggage, initially, one a business bag and one a more
normal piece of luggage. We do show several concepts of the luggage / torsorest
combination in this project and one finished prototype example. It may be that when
you collect your reward we can offer you more than one design choice. That will
be our aim.</p>

...VIDEO HIGHLIGHTING THE PROBLEM (YOU'LL IDENTIFY WITH THIS) AND THE CONSUMER RESPONSE TO THE MINI FLIGHT BED SOLUTION

...our brand name
Consumer study says:
""...you
only have to try it once to realize how effective it is""
“...It’s
amazing, I don’t understand why we have had to wait so long”
""...If
I could buy one now I would”
Medical study says:
“...
the torsorest is novel ergonomically in a number of ways utilising pressure
surfaces including buttock, posterior thigh, forearms, anterior chest wall and
the chin or head. It may be used by a range of people with differing age,
weight and height. It encourages postures which can increase lumbar flexion…
""
What is it?
The ‘mini flight bed’ is a slim,
lightweight, free standing platform that supports your waist, chest, neck and
head, delivering an alternative rest position with good posture and well
balanced weight distribution (half your weight is removed from your buttocks
and thighs).
Apart from the comfort delivered by
the mini flight bed, there are likely health benefits re back, neck and joint
pain and circulatory issues like DVT (economy class syndrome).
The ‘mini flight bed’ is the one and
only solution for travellers. It converts any seat, in any mode of transport,
into a comfortable sleeping place. 



...slim, easy to handle, when folded flat measures only 16"" in length
and occupies less than 7% of (small) European cabin luggage allowance
The Torsorest, ‘mini flight bed’ is
the first and only serious solution to a modern lifestyle problem – confinement
to a seat while travelling – it really does work.



..sketch of where we're headed, benefiting from the experience of 2
previous prototypes. Slim, lightweight, it feels a bit like a small tennis
racket to handle and slides easily into a shoulder bag or the smallest cabin
luggage allowance (European).

Our story
Hi, my name is Gordon Hamilton and
I'm the creator of the Torsorest, or ""mini flight bed"" concept.
During my business life I was
privileged to travel the world. Twenty years ago it used to amuse and puzzle me
that on arrival, even in business class and paying thousands of dollars, the
cabin looked more like a camp site after a music festival and the passengers
looked equally dishevelled. People just seemed to put up with it.
What they were putting up with was a
rapid change in the way we live our lives. Over the last 50 years, and
certainly since the problem accelerated with the flight of the first jumbo-jet
40 years ago, millions of us are now expected to spend more and more of our
travel time confined to a seat.
Things may have improved for the
business class traveller but not for the 91% of us who ride in the back.
With our increasingly hectic
lifestyle and our longer and longer multi-modal journeys you would expect the
opportunity to sit down, mid journey, and rest or sleep for a few hours might
be welcomed. Sadly this is not the case. 100% of passengers trying to sleep
while confined to a seat reported it was the worst part of their journey.
I’ve seen the same phenomenon on long
distance rail and coach journeys and even as a passenger on long car journeys. 
One particularly bad twenty four hour
coach journey inspired me to figure out what was wrong and do something about
it.
I started to think about the problem
from first principles – what makes sleeping in a bed comfortable? And, how
could I replicate that experience in a seat?
The essence of sleeping on a bed is
that all the articulated body parts (head, torso, arms, legs) are supported
independently, resulting in almost zero strain on the articulating connections
(neck, spine, joints). A secondary benefit of the independent support of body
parts is that the sleeping person can move easily, to relieve stiffening
joints, without having to consciously wake up. If you have ever watched time
lapse photography of someone sleeping on a bed you'll realise how much we need
to be able to move even during sleep.



...the ideal sleeping position
Contrast this with trying to sleep in
a seat. Here the effect of gravity on the body parts causes them to collapse down
creating massive strain on the articulating connections: the neck, the spine
and all the other joints. Not to mention concentrating all your upper body
weight on your lower body, buttocks and thighs.
So, the solution lay in finding a way
to support, INDEPENDENTLY, those body parts that were unsupported in a seat,
namely the head, upper torso, and arms.



...as good as the ideal?
My
solution, which you can deduce from the diagrams, is a unique product called
the Torsorest, or ‘Mini Flight Bed’, and is a free
standing platform that supports the waist, chest, neck and
head, INDEPENDENTLY.

...the
solution. We think so. (sketch not to scale)
The torsorest delivers a highly
effective sleep position with natural posture and well balanced weight
distribution (half your weight is removed from your buttocks and thighs). It is
lightweight, folds flat and occupies approx. 7% of passenger hand luggage.
It has an added bonus in that it also
allows some free movement of joints while sleeping and provides an important
alternative sleep position.
IN SHORT, IT MIMICS CLOSELY ALL THE BENEFITS OF SLEEPING IN A BED.

Further refinement of the concept
Having established the freestanding
platform concept, requiring an extending front leg, you can anticipate the next
step; why not use the extending handle of a wheelie bag for the leg, in fact
why not incorporate the Torsorest into the hand-luggage, so that it is always
with you when you travel and can be detached when needed. 
Here are the early concepts:

...early torsorest, 'mini flight bed' design concept
The
image above is the first design concept of the
torsorest by the UK design house, Kinnier Duffort. This was
prototyped for use with trials, market research and medical research.
The
images below show the luggage concept from
early conceptual art to a possible production item which was also prototyped:

...early concept of integrated
torsorest and bag
Extending the concept to luggage.

...any style of bag is possible. What
style would you prefer? – business; leisure; back-pack?

The first step on the way to the luggage prototype.


...prototype
bag incorporating the torsorest - proved the concept

...they've been around the globe



...almost half your body weight is removed from your buttocks and thighs. The feeling of relaxation is immediate.


These early designs and prototypes have shaped our
journey. 
Both
prototypes have travelled the world but more importantly they have proved the
concept with both consumer focus groups and a university based
medical study.


Market research:

- 40% would “buy it now” if it were in stores, the rest were very interested to
see the final product. This level of interest in the torsorest confirms the
fact that 100% of travellers find trying to sleep when confinement to a seat
the worst part of their journey. They want a solution, a solution that is long
overdue.

Medical study:

“…The forward resting position adopted with the Mini Flight Bed,
appears to reduce the lumbar lordosis (unnatural curvature of the
spine) … whilst at the same time mitigating compression and shear
forces by supporting the weight of the spine and upper body…”
“… support against the anterior chest may facilitate relaxation of
the erector spine muscle group and therefore reduce back pain or discomfort…”
...they
concluded:
“The opinion of the team is that the Mini Flight Bed has
significant potential to improve comfort or reduce discomfort … by facilitating
an alternative rest position with upper body support.""

How does it work in practice?

…step by step, it's so easy and sooo
comfortable

We didn't get
here by accident
A lot of research went
into fitting the solution to the harshest seating environment - aircraft:

...if it fits in aircraft, it will fit any mode of transport; rail, coach,
or car
Most long haul aircraft have the
longer legroom but the torsorest will adapt to even the smallest seating
arrangement in budget airlines. Merely adjust the torsorest to its steepest
setting and you'll be amazed at how much support it continues to provide. If
the seat in front reclines you can adjust the torsorest to a higher setting. In
fact, the reclined seat acts almost as an extension of your head resting area
(an unexpected bonus).
Anecdotes



Cabin crew report that up to 20% of
passengers already attempt to sleep by leaning forward on to their food trays.


Cabin crew also intimated that the
torsorest would be good for them too. Evidently, they often have to wait in
terminals between jobs, sometimes for long periods. The torsorest would help
them to make use of that 'downtime' by getting some proper sleep. They would
like to see it stocked in their 'Crew Outlet' stores. This highlights that the torsorest could be useful to anyone stranded in
transit by unforeseen events - missed flights, bad weather, volcanic ash clouds
– you know, the stuff that always happens to you!




What are our objectives

Design a super slim, super lightweight version of the prototype
torsorest. In your hand it will feel like your handling the head of a
tennis racket, and folding flat it will be easy to carry in a shoulder bag or
slip into your cabin bag.




        - Completed

Negotiate tooling and production
costs from reputable, quality assured Chinese factories.- Completed


Launch a campaign to seek the support
of the INDIEGOGO family to raise the $35,000 necessary to bring the new designs
of the lightweight version of the torsorest, 'mini flight bed' to market within
4 months.- 4 months – with your support


Design and launch an integrated torsorest with various styles of wheelie
type cabin luggage: business case, overnight case and backpack within 12 - 18
months.

Community Search  
Without mesh network
With mesh network

Community Search allows other people with tracMo app to help you find your lost items. When other tracMo users pass by your lost items, you’ll receive a notification updating you about the location of those items.What is Community Search?Is there any difference between Community Search in Bluetooth 4.2 and Bluetooth 5?In Bluetooth 4.2, only people with the app can help you locate your lost items. In Bluetooth 5, not only can other people with the app help, but also other trackers can help you locate your lost items.What is a mesh network?A mesh network is a network consisting of many nodes that can relay information to each other. The tracMo Mesh Station will act as a node. When a tracMo Mesh Station detects a lost tracMo tracker, it will relay this information to other tracMo Mesh Stations until the information reaches the tracMo Cloud. At that time, the lost tracMo user will be updated about the location of their lost tracMo. As a result, the more tracMo Mesh Stations installed, the broader the mesh network and its search coverage becomes.What is Over-The-Air Update?We will keep improving tracMo to better help you find your things. Over-The-Air Update will enable you to update your tracMo to the latest Bluetooth technology with ease, keeping your device current.______________________________________________________________________________________ORDER & SHIPPINGWhat countries do you ship to?We ship to most countries.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is John Dorfman, and I would like to introduce Mr. PullUp, an easy to use, portable device allowing one to do pull-ups on a door which I designed and patented!  This device makes it easy to do pull-ups at home or at a hotel / friend's house while on the road.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I am attempting to raise $12,500 to mass produce 500 Mr. PullUps.  You can help me and get one easy to use, portable Mr. PullUp to perform pull-ups with a $25 pledge.  This will be all or nothing funding, so if I do not raise the $12,500, pledges would be refunded and no perks would be given.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>How to Use Mr. Pull-up<br/>
</h3>
<p>To use Mr. PullUp, simply place Mr. PullUp on top of an open door and slide over to contact door trim.  Then grab on to Mr. PullUp and hang or perform pull-ups.  When done, just raise Mr. PullUp off the door and store in a convenient place such as a closet.  Mr. PullUp works best on a door that is about 1 3/8 inches thick which includes most American indoor doors.  Mr. PullUp essentially replaces the sharp edged flat top surface of the door with a smooth semi circular surface simulating the top 
half of a typical pull-up bar.  See the video for a demonstration.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>While using Mr. PullUp, make sure your door, door hinges, door hinge screws and door frame are strong enough to support your weight while performing pull-ups.  Also, remove anything from the front of your body such as belt buckles or jewellery that could scratch the door.  Mr. PullUp works with arm spans less than 24 inches wide (Mr. PullUp is 24 inches long).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Mr. PullUp Complete Feature List<br/>
</h3>
<p>- Portable making it easy to take with while traveling.</p>
<p>    - Measures 24 x 1-5/8 x 3 inches or 24 x 2 x 2 inches if flexible flanges are tucked over each other</p>
<p>    - Weights less than a pound<br/></p>
<p>    - Fits in medium to large size backpacks and suitcase (see measurements just above)</p>
<p>- Takes less than 30 seconds to install and remove Mr. PullUp from the door</p>
<p>- Easy to install and remove from a door<br/></p>
<p>- Works best with doors that are about 1 3/8 inch thick (most American indoor doors)</p>
<p>- Stores easily in a closet</p>
<p>- Muscles utilized performing pull-ups: See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_%28exercise%29#Muscles_used"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>- Flexible Top Sheet made from soft yoga stickymat material</p>
<p>    - Gives hands good grip while having a more comfortable softness</p>
<p>    - Hanging flaps prevent hands from being pinched between Mr. PullUp and the door</p>
<p>- Flexible End Sheet made from soft yoga stickymat material</p>
<p>    - Contacts and minimizes wear to door trim<br/></p>
<p>    - Located on both ends</p>
<p>- Flexible Bottom Sheet made from soft yoga stickymat material</p>
<p>    - Contacts and minimizes wear to top of door<br/></p>

<h3>My Story and Reason for being on IndieGoGo<br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I have a mechanical engineering degree from University of Wisconsin - Madison and have been a practicing mechanical engineer for the past 14 years in the consumer products industry.  I have spent the last 2 years on my own developing Mr. PullUp and writing, filing and receiving a patent for Mr. PullUp.  I originally came up with the idea looking for a simple device to do pull-ups.  Mr. PullUp seems to be about the simplest device out there.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now as stated above, I would to see if there is enough interest out there to mass produce 500 Mr. PullUps by essentially pre-selling one Mr. PullUp with each $25 pledge.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So first, as stated before, I am trying to raise $12,500 with all or nothing funding to mass produce 500 Mr. PullUps.  So if the $12,500 is not raised, pledges would be refunded and no perks would be given. Raising $12,500 (or 500 Mr. PullUps) would enable me to buy the piece parts (I would be assembling piece parts together) in a large enough quantity thus pushing down the piece part cost enough (economy of scale) to make the various pledge points economically viable.  So please help me raise $12,500 and get a great pull-up device at the same time!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you just want to see more Mr. PullUps in the world, there is the $10 pledge which gives a good feeling of helping to make that happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Or if you would like to have a Mr. PullUp to exercise with, then with a $25 pledge, you receive one Mr. PullUp with free shipping (in the USA).  Add +$16.50 for shipping to Canada and +$21 to ship anywhere else in the world!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Or pledge at the $125 or $250 level and I will take you out for coffee at my local coffee shop for 1/2 hour or lunch at my local restaurant for 1 hour respectively.  If you are not local, we would have a 1/2 hour or 1 hour long conversation, respectively, on Skype.  We can talk shop about my journey developing and patenting Mr. PullUp or anything else!  And you get one Mr. PullUp with same shipping terms stated above!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If I reach my $12,500 dollar goal, Mr. PullUps would be shipped about 3 months after the end of the campaign and having coffee or lunch could start to happen shortly after the campaign ends.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>If You Like Mr. PullUp<br/>
</h3>
<p>Or you think your friends would like Mr. PullUp, please get the word out about the Mr. PullUp campaign.  Feel free to use the share tools to help achieve this.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Mr. PullUp is an easy to use, portable pull-up device to do pull-ups on a door which you can essentially pre-order wth a $25 pledge!  If I do not reach my $12,500 goal, then pledges will be refunded and no perks will be given.  If you are interested in a great pull-up device and want to help me reach my $12,500 goal, please click one of the green pledge buttons on the right.</p>

For Example: If the house has 10 vents, 3 OneZone Single can be installed.</p><p><strong>Q: How far from the grill can the thermostat be located?</strong><br/>A: It can be located up to 50 feet away from the grill. But in order to work properly and detect the right temperature of the room, it should be located near the grill in a place with good air circulation. That’s why we recommend to locate the thermostat 15 feet’s away from the grill.</p><p><strong>Q: What size dampers are available?</strong><br/>A: OneZone Single damper comes in three sizes for round ducts: 6’’, 8’’ and 10’’.</p><p><strong>Q: Is there a OneZone Single for square ducts?</strong><br/>A: No, we are in the process of developing this new product.</p><p><strong>Q: How does OneZone work?</strong><br/>A: The user selects the desired temperature, the damper’s gate opens to let hot or cold air (depending on the mode the unit is running), when the selected temperature is reached, the damper’s gate closes automatically. This process is repeated when the temperature changes.</p><p><strong>Q: When does the OneZone Single damper close?</strong><br/>A: Cooling mode: It closes when the temperature of the zone where the OneZone Single is installed is lower than the selected temperature on the OneZone Single thermostat.<br/>Heating mode: It closes when the temperature of the zone where the OneZone Single is installed is higher than the selected temperature on the OneZone Single thermostat.</p><p><strong>Q: Can OneZone Single be installed in a two grills room?</strong><br/>A: If both grills are for air supply, you can install two OneZone Single dampers, but only one thermostat. The thermostat needs to be located equidistant from both grills. So when the temperature is set on the thermostat, the two dampers will get the IR signal, and adjust the temperature of the room. The same happens for a zone that has 3 grills.</p><p><strong>Q: Does OneZone Single work with either air conditioning or heating?</strong><br/>A: Yes. The user just needs to select cooling mode or heating mode as desired. The sun icon on the screen refers to Heating Mode, and the Star to Cooling mode.</p><p><strong>Q: If my OneZone Single is closed, will the air supply continue flowing?</strong><br/>A: Yes, even when OneZone Single is completely closed, it will still allow approximately 7% of the normal air supply in order to control humidity and maintain the appropriate minimum temperature.</p><p><strong>Q: Why is it energy saving?</strong><br/>A: With OneZone Single the user will be able to regulate the airflow so the air will go to the areas where it’s needed. The main thermostat will achieve the desired temperature faster and earlier, using less energy.</p><p><strong>Q: How long do the batteries last?</strong><br/>The damper’s batteries last a year. The thermostat’s batteries last 2 years. Approximately.</p><p><strong>Q: What type of batteries does OneZone Single use?</strong><br/>A: The damper uses 2 regular C batteries, and the thermostat 2 regular AAA batteries.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I know if I have to change the batteries?</strong><br/>A: In the damper a small red light located in the IR receiver will blink once in a while. When it starts blinking the user will have at least two weeks to change the batteries.

<h3>Why Do I Want a New Pillow Every 6 months?</h3>
<p>Doctors recommend changing pillows this often.  Most people don't do it nearly enough.  Your pillow is a really important part of sleep, and thus, of your health.  After too long, the pillow gets heavy with dead skin and body oils, and sinks down in the middle.  When pillows are finally replaced, the can often weigh twice as much as when they were new. Having a subscription means you don’t have to think about it: you’ll always have plump, clean, fresh, white, new pillows.  New pillow = better, more hygienic sleep.</p>
<h3>What Pillows Will I Get? </h3>
<p>They are standard polyfill pillows. They are comfortable, and not expensive: $19 apiece. Since Dreamless will send new ones every 6 months, you’ll always be sleeping on a fluffy, full one. </p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>We have a supplier lined up, but we need enough backers to achieve an order minimum.  If we get enough people behind Dreamless, we can take a giant step forward.  If this stage goes well, we will expand into new pillow types, as well as sheets.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>I have a habit of waking my wife up to tell her business ideas. About two years ago, I woke her up to say that someone should make a pillow subscription service, because we (my wife and I) always kept our pillows way too long.  I thought it was a good idea for a person like me, but I wasn’t sure if anyone else would want such a service. I sat on the idea.  </p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been sleeping on a pillow that I need to replace. I could easily go buy new pillows, but somehow I haven’t gotten around to it.  It sounds super lazy, but if you're honest with yourself, you probably have the same problem.  A subscription solves it.</p>
<p>I decided to finally take the steps to see if there is interest for this service.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is getting the word out enough to achieve critical mass.</p>
<p>The risk for contributors is that they won't like the pillows we send.  For this reason, the entry level perk is a single pillow, so you can sleep on a Dreamless pillow before signing up for the subscription.  In addition, our current pricing model doesn't lock you in: we charge the same price per pillow whether you commit to a single delivery or 4 deliveries.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We think Dreamless is awesome, but we understand if you're not in a position to contribute money.  Please consider that there might be some people you know who would benefit from Dreamless, and share it with them.  Indiegogo has some sharing tools to make it extra easy.</p>

The risk for contributors is that they won't like the pillows we send.  For this reason, the entry level perk is a single pillow, so you can sleep on a Dreamless pillow before signing up for the subscription.  In addition, our current pricing model doesn't lock you in: we charge the same price per pillow whether you commit to a single delivery or 4 deliveries.

Ways You Can Help
We think Dreamless is awesome, but we understand if you're not in a position to contribute money.  Please consider that there might be some people you know who would benefit from Dreamless, and share it with them.  Indiegogo has some sharing tools to make it extra easy.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>          RBS President Charles R. Nelson</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have joined the quickly growing number of people using crowd funding because we are trying to launch the first (Perfect Picnic) in a line of products I designed for my company, Russell Bay Shelters LLC (RBS). Though a carpenter/welder by trade, I started RBS (with the help of my brother) as a platform for my creative endeavors. Like my late father, Elmer Nelson, I’ve always been designing, inventing, and fabricating cool things that I think of – it’s in my DNA! Thanks Dad! I will also admit that working as a carpenter during the subzero weather of northern Wisconsin winters might have also played a part in my efforts to branch out into other ways of making a living.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""fwb""><span class=""fwb"">OUR PRODUCT:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>The “Perfect Picnic” outdoor table shelter is an innovative and stylish answer to a common problem – protecting what’s on your picnic table from the elements and beyond! Our shelter has a removable screen (for keeping out the bugs) which opens on both sides and is made of waterproof material. With the “Perfect Picnic,” you can have a birthday cake outside with lit candles in a 60 mph wind! That is if you’re into “extreme” birthday partying.  By blocking out the wind, it keeps your plates and napkins from blowing away as well as preventing your “hot wings” from becoming “cold wings!”  If rain breaks out in the middle of your get together, just zip up the screen and wait for the storm to pass. It can also be accessorized for night picnics or camping with a low energy LED lighting kit that attaches to the ceiling.</p>
<p><img alt=""Shelter shown with led interior lighting."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/383431_134608496669209_1311595465_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Interior lights are made to last and velcro into place, very cool accessory!</p>
<p>It’s really cool to see a shelter lit up at night with all the food and amenities inside, very cool! It’s also easy to set-up! It takes about 3-4 minutes even when it’s windy and only about 1 minute after the first set-up if you store it partially assembled (recommended).</p>
<p>Though we named it the Perfect Picnic, it actually helps bring people together in the outdoors in many other ways than just for picnics, e.g. tailgating parties (sports, concerts, shows, etc…) with the tailgate version (coming soon), camping, outdoor art shows (for displaying works), wedding receptions, outdoor catering, food lines for disaster relief, flee markets, outdoor food markets, lemonade stands, birthday parties, retirement gatherings, graduation parties, summer camps for kids, etc…</p>

<p>But hey! Why listen to me go on and on when you can get the opinion of a guy who makes custom tents and shelters for a living! That’s right, I’m talking about Kevin Rak, President of Pinnacle Tents, our manufacturer in Phoenix AZ:</p>
<p>“As a tent manufacturer for over 17 years, we believe your ""Perfect Picnic"" picnic table shelter has immense market potential: The product has broad appeal for various applications ranging from the afternoon picnic to camping and catering use. Potential unit sales are similar to the unit sales of camping tents. The low price point will make it affordable and appealing to a large demographic. The added benefits that the ""Perfect Picnic"" is protected by a patent, has no other similar product to compete with, and offers a unique solution to a difficulty that everyone experiences in dining outdoors, will generate instant interest and acceptance in the marketplace.”<br/>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Kevin Rak President Pinnacle Tents</p>
<p><span lang=""EN"">Commercial Products: </span><a href=""http://www.pinnacletents.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><span lang=""EN"">www.pinnacletents.com</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>By the way, the final version that is featured in the video and pictured on our website ( <a href=""http://www.russellbayshelters.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><span lang=""EN"">www.russellbayshelters.com</span></span></span></a><span lang=""EN""> ) was manufactured for our inspection by Pinnacle Tents.</span></p>
<p><strong></strong>Presently, there are twelve new patent pending products RBS plans on offering. We chose the “Perfect Picnic” as the first to introduce to the marketplace as it had the lowest cost and highest appeal. By manufacturing and distributing a large shipment of Perfect Picnic shelters, we would increase our chances of not only being successful with that product, but the subsequent interest generated would help us get funding for our other products as well. This in turn would enable us to launch our entire line of products, making them available to the public by next summer.</p>
<p>With the help of contributors, in just months they will have a great product in their hands, before the public I should add.  Then large retailors will offer our product across the country, all because a group of people offered to act on our presale offer funding our initial order, something no bank has been willing to do. </p>
<p>Russell Bay Shelters LLC headquarters is and always will be on Madeline Island.  Adding badly needed year round jobs is also part of our focus.  Warehousing and manufacturing will be caried out elseware.</p>
<p><strong>What we want to do:</strong></p>

This in turn would enable us to launch our entire line of products, making them available to the public by next summer.</p>
<p><strong>What the funds are for:</strong></p>
<p>After countless hours of designing and ten variations (hand crafted by me in my garage), we're now ready to introduce the “Perfect Picnic” to a hopefully receptive market. In order to make our price point, we need the $25,000.00 to place an initial order of shelters with our manufacturer, Pinnacle Tents in Phoenix. If we raise enough to place our first order, we will have achieved our initial goal! </p>
<p>This is an ""all or nothing"" fund raiser for us because we don't want contributors to wait for their rewards.  We want a short wait with a very clear and well thought out business plan.  Either we raise the funds and can safely move forward or we find another way.</p>
<p>We are hoping that by raising this amount, manufacturing the shelters, and distributing them to our backers as rewards (along with some other goodies), we will have proven the commercial viability of the Perfect Picnic which will encourage retailers to place orders for their stores. That is our ultimate goal! In essence, and like many Indiegogo projects, we are pre-selling our shelters to our potential backers in order to help pay for the first shipment from Pinnacle Tents. Just like a parent guiding their child as they learn to ride a bike, after our first order, we believe we can “let go” of our creation and let it ride on its own merits. Actually, I think I crashed when my dad let go but you get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>Perks, presale offer and super cool stuff!</strong></p>
<p>We think of Crowd funding as a ""win-win"" for all involved!  We want all of our contributors to benefit from this campaign as much as we will.  We spent a lot of time on all of the perk levels with the goal of offering something for every interest level.</p>
<p>Our main perk is offering the Perfect picnic table shelter as a presale product so you will get yours under retail and before the general public!</p>
<p>Another perk is a cool T-shirt I designed.  It's a quality 100% cotton shirt printed in the U.S.A!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""T-shirt"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/318280_136983179765074_182147067_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The removable screen comes with the shelter but the accessory LED interior lighting is offered as a separate perk so if you are going to use it at night, check this out!</p>
<p>Then there is an award winning book I wrote on the history of the Madeline Island Windsled, ""On Thin Ice - Windsleds at Madeline"". </p>
<p><img alt=""Windsled book"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/309952_144127972383928_1321766555_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> Great book and I will be making it extra special as a limited signed copy.  At the highest level 7 Island windsled operators will be signing the book, very rare copy!</p>
<p>The book is a great story about a group of Island inventors that rose to the challenge of creating a very special craft to full the gap between the Island's Ferry and ice-road seasons.  The book is filled with great stories, photos and 133 very detailed illustrations like those below!</p>
<p><img alt=""illustration-1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/543329_136319276498131_794749831_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The above sled was designed and built by my Father, Martin E. Nelson Sr. out of a Piper Cub aircraft. </p>
<p><img alt=""windsled -2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/427794_136321099831282_1592986940_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This sled was constructed out of a Ford Model-T, note the wooden spoke wheels!</p>
<p>So, please look over all of the Perks before you choose and I think you will find them to be generous at all levels.</p>
<p><strong>The impact of our success:</strong></p>
<p>I am a creative person and though my workshop is full of prototypes, I have yet to get any of them into the marketplace.  If I can't find funding I may be forced to cut back on my design work.  In a short 4 year period I have created over 20 products, the success of this attempt at crowd funding will set in motion everything I have been working for.  The necessary funds will flip a switch to get us off and running! </p>
<p>The successful launch of this product will be wonderful for not only Russell Bay Shelters but area entrepreneurs.  As we have been working on developing our own products we have had a large number of inventors coming forward asking how to develop and prototype ideas.  We think it would be wonderful to assist area inventors with their own designs and once they have a prototype we can direct them to Indiegogo.com</p>
<p>We find that there are so many people out there with great concepts but have no idea what to do with them!  I was lucky to be able to not just come up with the concepts but I am a craftsman, product designer, technical writer and illustrator so I needed little help in getting the product developed and prototyped, just needed help in funding the innitial product run.</p>
<p>We've received incredible interest in this new innovative product from friends and strangers alike! For instance, Gander Mountain, an outdoor themed retailer in the U.S. has agreed to place the Perfect Picnic on their website to “test” the public’s interest.  In addition, many of our friends and customers from my construction business are eager to become backers and spread the word to their friends to check us out on Indiegogo. Bottom line is, we've received a lot of positive feedback and it’s got us very excited about our chances of success! </p>
<p>Anyway, we hope you take a good look at the Perfect Picnic on Indiegogo along with our other cool rewards for backers and visit our website at <a href=""http://www.russellbayshelters.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><span lang=""EN"">www.russellbayshelters.com</span></span></span></a><span lang=""EN""> to learn more about us. </span></p>
