Je me suis donc engagée à amasser 20 000 $ par année pour les trois prochaines années ! L'argent qui sera amassé avec cette campagne va servir à financer la recherche et à créer des services pour les jeunes adultes atteints de SP!

On va se le dire, c'est n'est pas cool. MAIS, la bonne nouvelle c'est que grâce à l'argent qui a été amassé au cours des 30 dernières années, il y a maintenant des médicaments hyper efficaces qui permettent aux personnes atteintes de sclérose en plaques de mieux vivre avec cette maladie. Il faut par contre continuer à faire avancer la recherche. Pour qu'un jour, nous puissions vivre dans <strong>UN MONDE SANS SP! </strong></p><p>Je ne le cacherai pas, j'ai eu une période très noire après avoir reçu mon diagnostic. Une fois que la lumière est apparue au bout du tunnel, j'ai décidé de me remonter les manches et de mettre à profit mon expérience et mes contacts au profit de ma cause, celle de la sclérose en plaques. Après m'être rendu compte qu'il y avait très peu de plateformes adaptées aux jeunes qui sont aux prises avec la maladie, j'ai décidé de mettre sur pied PS j'ai la SP sur <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/spscleroseenplaques/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ps_jai_la_sp/?hl=fr-ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram </a>et <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdgR0NlVPrzBxgHW2kPZPJw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a>. Une plateforme où je partage de l'information ''mind, body and soul'' pour aider les jeunes adultes atteints de SP à mieux vivre avec leur maladie. J'y donne des trucs et astuces pour agir sur les éléments sur lesquels  nous avons le contrôle.  Par la suite, je me suis dit : ON VA FAIRE UN SHOW ! Un spectacle au visage des jeunes adultes atteints de SP et qui, du même coup, visait à sensibiliser la population à l'importance des dons pour que la recherche en SP puisse continuer d'avancer. La recherche est notre seul espoir. La première édition du SP Show a eu un succès MONSTRE ! Merci, merci, merci à tous ceux et celles qui étaient présents! Grâce à vous, nous avons amassé un peu plus de 25 000 $ qui ont été remis à  la Société canadienne de la sclérose en plaques. </p><h3><strong>Les projets qui seront financés par le Fonds Sophie Berriault </strong></h3><ul>

<strong>LE SP SHOW !! </strong>Gang, on refait le SP Show ! Le tout se tiendra le 30 mai 2020. Le mois de mai étant le mois de la sensibilisation à la sclérose en plaques, on va finir ce mois en beauté avec un SHOW DE FEU !!! </li>

<strong>LA WEBSÉRIE ! </strong>Ok ! Je capoooote sur ce projet !

C'est du ''feel good moment'' à la tonne, je te le promets ! L'objectif avec ce projet est de faire en sorte que les gens atteints de SP se sentent moins seuls.

My favorite hobby is creating recipes for people with food allergies/sensitivities and limited diets since I have experience with all three. I recently completed the academic requirements for my Master of Science in Human Nutrition after returning to school to pursue a career that will help improve the lives of people like myself with complex chronic illnesses. I began studying dietary changes, nutrition, and biochemistry on my own after I was disabled a decade ago from health issues caused by inflammation and oxidative stress from mold exposure in water damaged buildings. Conventional medical treatment caused dry beriberi, a serious B vitamin deficiency, that made my body slowly shut down. It took over a year and visits to multiple specialists before I obtained a diagnosis and treatment for a problem that could have been prevented with an inexpensive supplement available at every grocery store and pharmacy. I realized then that most doctors don't recognize symptoms or risk factors for nutrient deficiencies and don't know how to prevent, test for, or treat them even though cells need proper nutrition in order to function and to reduce risk of disease, disability, and/or early death. My health slowly improved as I worked with an integrative/functional medicine MD to implement what I learned from my studies. I eventually returned to school to study evidence-based nutrition in an academic setting with a goal of helping people with chronic illnesses with nutrition and lifestyle changes that will improve their overall health. I am steps away from completing that goal and need your help to achieve it.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543713796/bqutjxznslbryr8lxytx.png"" src=""""/></p><p>I'm seeking funds to start a nutritional consulting company out of my home with in-person and remote appointments available through telephone, email, instant messenger, and/or video chat. Working out of my home will allow me the freedom to set my own schedule and work around my ongoing health challenges. As an independent nutritionist I'm not beholden to any sponsorship agreements with governmental agencies, food industries, drug companies, or private laboratories made by professional organizations. While I have biases in favor of real/whole foods over industrial foods, I'm guided primarily by high quality scientific research, biochemistry, and experience.</p><p>To reach my goals I need at least $1500 to take Heart-Root Nutrition from a seed of an idea to a living and growing company. Those funds will be used in the following ways:</p><ul>
<li>articles of limited liability corporation and local business license</li>
<li>professional liability insurance</li>
<li>domain name and website, credit card processing, etc.</li>
<li>signage, promotional materials, business cards, etc.</li>
</ul><p>If I don't meet my entire goal, my business priorities are establishing my LLC and local business license and obtaining professional liability insurance. Without those three things I can't be a practicing nutritionist.</p><h3>Perks</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543713914/eobx8de8navuj8afjhic.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Donations will be happily accepted, but I don't expect something for nothing. I'm offering my services as a clinical nutritionist as well as a few other perks using the research and writing skills honed during my studies.</p><ul>
<li>Standardized advice for your choice of one chronic illness, including autoimmune diseases, coronary artery disease, GERD, hypertension, inflammatory conditions, metabolic syndrome, obesity, pre-diabetes, and type II diabetes. Document will cover dietary advice, lifestyle changes, supplements, and suggested laboratory testing, also includes citations from relevant research articles.</li>
<li>A PDF copy of my science-based Clinical Guide to Botanical Medicine containing information on 50 common herbal supplements. Information within the guide includes the biochemical and physiological effects of each botanical, dosages used in clinical trials, standardization criteria, and a list of clinically effective brand name products, many verified for purity and dosage by third-party testing.</li>
<li>Initial nutrition consultation with me either in-person or via remote services (telephone, email, instant messenger, or video chat), depending on your location. Includes a personalized nutritional and lifestyle plan based on information provided to me in your new client packet (medical history, recent laboratory test results, a three-day food log, etc.) and associated materials required for you to be successful.</li>
<li>Initial nutrition consultation as discussed above plus a follow-up visit 2-4 weeks later to discuss your progress and any challenges or successes you've had.</li>
<li>Research report on a health issue of your choice. I'll analyze and summarize recent research so you don't have to. Report will include pathophysiology, conventional treatments, promising future treatments, nutrition and lifestyle interventions, and citation of relevant research articles as appropriate.</li>

I eventually returned to school to study evidence-based nutrition in an academic setting with a goal of helping people with chronic illnesses with nutrition and lifestyle changes that will improve their overall health. I am steps away from completing that goal and need your help to achieve it.ObjectiveI'm seeking funds to start a nutritional consulting company out of my home with in-person and remote appointments available through telephone, email, instant messenger, and/or video chat. Working out of my home will allow me the freedom to set my own schedule and work around my ongoing health challenges. As an independent nutritionist I'm not beholden to any sponsorship agreements with governmental agencies, food industries, drug companies, or private laboratories made by professional organizations. While I have biases in favor of real/whole foods over industrial foods, I'm guided primarily by high quality scientific research, biochemistry, and experience.To reach my goals I need at least $1500 to take Heart-Root Nutrition from a seed of an idea to a living and growing company. Those funds will be used in the following ways:
articles of limited liability corporation and local business license
professional liability insurance
domain name and website, credit card processing, etc.
signage, promotional materials, business cards, etc.
If I don't meet my entire goal, my business priorities are establishing my LLC and local business license and obtaining professional liability insurance. Without those three things I can't be a practicing nutritionist.PerksDonations will be happily accepted, but I don't expect something for nothing. I'm offering my services as a clinical nutritionist as well as a few other perks using the research and writing skills honed during my studies.
Standardized advice for your choice of one chronic illness, including autoimmune diseases, coronary artery disease, GERD, hypertension, inflammatory conditions, metabolic syndrome, obesity, pre-diabetes, and type II diabetes. Document will cover dietary advice, lifestyle changes, supplements, and suggested laboratory testing, also includes citations from relevant research articles.
A PDF copy of my science-based Clinical Guide to Botanical Medicine containing information on 50 common herbal supplements. Information within the guide includes the biochemical and physiological effects of each botanical, dosages used in clinical trials, standardization criteria, and a list of clinically effective brand name products, many verified for purity and dosage by third-party testing.
Initial nutrition consultation with me either in-person or via remote services (telephone, email, instant messenger, or video chat), depending on your location. Includes a personalized nutritional and lifestyle plan based on information provided to me in your new client packet (medical history, recent laboratory test results, a three-day food log, etc.) and associated materials required for you to be successful.
Initial nutrition consultation as discussed above plus a follow-up visit 2-4 weeks later to discuss your progress and any challenges or successes you've had.
Research report on a health issue of your choice. I'll analyze and summarize recent research so you don't have to. Report will include pathophysiology, conventional treatments, promising future treatments, nutrition and lifestyle interventions, and citation of relevant research articles as appropriate.
ImpactOur healthcare systems are overwhelmed by people with chronic diseases and the number is expected to significantly increase by 2030 (see chart below). In order to reduce the rates of chronic diseases and improve the lives of those already living with them, people must take control of their own health. This is where Heart-Root Nutrition comes in.Heart-Root Nutrition offers personalized, evidence-based nutrition and lifestyle recommendations along with guidance and support to individuals with chronic illnesses or at risk for developing chronic illnesses, helping them improve their own lives, which in turn reduces stress on an overburdened healthcare system. By offering in-person and remote services I can help many more people than just those within my community. I also plan to offer discounts to people with disabilities or low incomes, active or retired military personnel and their families, and those referred by participating healthcare providers. By supporting my campaign you're not only helping me fund the growth of Heart-Root Nutrition, you're helping yourself and others obtain life-changing nutrition and lifestyle information for years to come.Other Ways You Can HelpI know only too well that not everyone can afford to support a fundraising campaign with money. You can still help by spreading the word and sharing this campaign with your friends, family, and social media network. Thank you!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Essential Goal: <strong>111k Downpayment &amp; Renovations</strong></p>
<p>To secure the Mr. Wisdom's space, we'll need <strong>$65,000</strong> for a down payment, as well as another estimated <strong>$25,000</strong> to renovate and modernize the space. This amount gets our foot in the door with some of the resources needed to turn this establishment back into a health store. We estimate $5,500 would go to Indiegogo fees, and $4,500 would go toward perk fulfillment.</p>
<p>Stretch Goal: <strong>250k Downpayment, Inventory, Renovations, Staff</strong></p>
<p>This amount is our sweet spot. It allows for a larger downpayment of <strong>$140,000</strong>, resulting in a lower mortgage, and allows us to budget <strong>$40,000</strong> for renovations, <strong>$25,000</strong> for staff and <strong>$23,000</strong> for inventory. We estimate $12,500 would go to Indiegogo fees, and $5,500 would go toward perk fulfillment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimate Goal: <strong>750k Purchase Property, Renovation, Inventory, Staff, Insurance</strong></p>
<p>This would be phenomenal. Raising this amount would allow us to <strong>purchase the property outright</strong>, so that we can guarantee our service to the community for decades to come and never have to worry about eviction or rent increases. </p>
<p><strong>$520,000</strong> would mostly pay for the property, with <strong>$70,000</strong> for renovations, <strong>$50,000</strong> for staff and for <strong>$34,000</strong> for inventory, <strong>$30,000 </strong>and for other concerns like marketing and insurance, giving us a great start to a successful business that will serve the community for decades to come. We estimate $37,500 would go to Indiegogo fees, and $8,500 would go toward perk fulfillment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dream: <strong>1.2 Million Everything above + Free community dinners and programs. </strong></p>
<p>An additional <strong>$450,000</strong> would help us expand our community impact. SÜPRSEED is a 501(c)3 that powers events, grocery giveaways, juice cleanse scholarships and more to create the experiences and support systems needed for long term lifestyle changes. Raising 1.2 million is a dream that would empower us to continue free plant based dinners Mr. Wisdom lead each week, offer support to other healthy food start ups in the area, discount goods in the store based on the area median income, and make a huge and lasting impact on South Central's health for good. </p>
<h2>What We'll Have</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/1yLTRvh7eEETFOBYRC/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Organic Fruits &amp; Veggies &amp; Bulk Goods</strong> from local farms like Alma Backyard Farms, &amp; the South Central Farmer's Co-op.  We'll carry tropical goods like pineapples &amp; mangos + dry bulk goods like nuts, dates, coconut oil, quinoa and more. <br/><strong>Healthy Snacks + Packaged Foods</strong> from brands like: Beanfield's and Field Roast.<br/><strong>Delicious Prepared meals + Grab &amp; Go options</strong> from local artisans like Baba's Vegan Cafe<br/><strong>Sustainable Body Products &amp; Household goods</strong> from brands like: Dr. Bronner's, Alaffia, Dr. Hauschka's &amp; more.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's our backup plan? </h3>
<p>We are 100% committed to making this a reality. That said, if we fall short of our fundraising goals we will use whatever we have toward securing the store and continue to raise funds via whatever channels become available to us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Feed People.</strong></p>
<p>With a physical location, we can start serving 1,000 Angelenos per week. Having more space to pack produce boxes, delivery vans, and manufacturing space means we can have a significant impact on the 1.3 Million people in our area, and even get food insecure to folks across LA.</p>
<p><strong>Heal People.</strong><br/><a href=""https://www.cdcfoundation.org/pr/2015/heart-disease-and-stroke-cost-america-nearly-1-billion-day-medical-costs-lost-productivity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1 billion dollars</a> is spent on preventable healthcare in the US <strong>every day</strong>.  Living in a food desert makes you far more likely to suffer from a preventable disease. For instance, obesity rates are 25% higher in South LA than West LA and 13% <a href=""http://suprmarkt.la/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Food-Desert-to-Food-Oasis.-Promoting-Grocery-Store-Development-in-South-Los-Angeles.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">higher than the county average</a>. As natives of the community, <strong>we combine an urgent need to heal our friends and family members with well branded retail access to healthy food.</strong> Most importantly, we lead events and programs that help our audience eat healthily in culturally relevant ways. For instance, we've sponsored free and affordable juice cleanses for 40 people.  </p>
<p><strong>End The Health Apartheid. </strong></p>
<p>Our success in opening this store will be just the first step in a nationwide movement to provide forgotten areas with the resources they need to thrive. We've had people write us from places like Chicago and try to order produce from places like Alabama-- so seeing us succeed will inspire people everywhere to do the same and equip us with the experience to help others and expand this concept.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>It is always a risk to open a brick and mortar location— but the neighborhood needs this. We're the right fit to step in and take over where Mr. Wisdom's left off.</p>
<p>Our biggest plus is that we have worked out many of the learning curve kinks associated with grocery service and built up a customer base. That said, these areas will be new challenges for us:</p>

Purchasing the property next door will allow for expansion of what The Heron Farm and Event Center has offered for almost 30 years. PFM Ventures, LLC is being formed in order to act as stewards of this new piece of land and expand on the legacy of The Heron.  PFM stands for PURE F*ING MAGIC and expresses our belief that we can manifest anything we set our hearts to. We have had an abundance of people with all sorts of exciting ideas for what they would like to offer for programming and events once the PFM Venture land is ours. The possibilities are endless and we want to share all of this with YOU!We want to include you, our supporters, friends and Heron family in solidifying Phase One, the beginning of this exciting endeavor!

<h3>Homemade Betty</h3>
<p>My name is Rebecca and a Stay at home mom of 3 children. I have been Holistic my whole life and have always looked for natural ways to heal myself and my family. My skin care line started over 10 years ago after searching &amp; searching for a lotion.I wanted something that would not only heal my skin but also that I could pronounce the ingredients, I came up empty handed.</p>
<p>I started looking back on all that I learned growing up and started making a rich body butter with only 4 organic, vegan ingredients in it. It was amazing! After years of using it and giving it to friends and family, I looked to my medicine cabinet to see what else I could replace. One by one I replaced my drug store items with all natural simple and effective skincare.</p>
<p>I started selling to the public over 3 years ago and have grown very fast. Not only do I take pride in being a cruelty free, organic, fair trade and Eco-friendly company, but also being a resource for many amazing customers.</p>
<p>With funds raised for Homemade Betty we will be able to open a  local store front where customers can bring their zero-waste jars and refill on their favorite products. Learn about natural skincare and what they can do at home, sample all of our products to see what fits their skin needs and also we will have teaching events that will be held monthly to learn how to make their own body care.</p>
<p>In addition to these funds, extra money will be used to create a vegan, organic makeup line &amp;  more household items for zero-waste options. Such as, laundry detergent, Castile soap, multi-purpose cleaner &amp; other useful non-toxic items.</p>
<p>My company could have not come this far without my amazing customers and their appreciation for my products. This dream of opening a store has been something I have always envisioned and we are finally ready to move forward.</p>

<p>Family, identity, home, life and death are all themes explored in Everything Must Change.  Over the last 6 years we have been intensely living through Mariam's Breast Cancer diagnosis, while making this intimate film.  The story has taken a life of it's own and expanded into a broader story of hope, healing and survival. Having personally financed the film for over 6 years, we've maxed out our funds and need your support to complete the film in time for festival submissions this September.</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Six years ago when I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer, I thought it would just be a “bump in the road.”  Boy, was I wrong.  With the help of my ex-boyfriend Kenny Krauss, who came to support me, we started documenting my journey from the very beginning not knowing where it would take us.  What unfolded was stranger than anything we could have ever imagined. Despite the personal challenges of living through it, while making the film, we continued to follow the story. And we didn't hold back.  It's RAW, REAL, FUNNY and UPLIFTING.</p>
<p>Needless to say, facing a life threatening illness has irreversibly changed us both. This uplifting documentary explores themes such as: the quest for meaning when faced with a life-threatening illness and the healing power of true love and friendship.</p>
<p>Kenny and I have over 20 years of experience working on TV shows telling other people’s stories. We have worked for networks including: CBS, PBS, ABC, FOX, MTV, A&amp;E and more. Our documentary, The Fighting Cholitas, about female Bolivian wrestlers premiered at Sundance, winning an Honorable Mention and went on to be screened at a hundred festivals around the world, winning 9 additional awards along the way.</p>
<p>We have been filming and editing this story for the last 6 years. At this point, we are asking for your support to finish the film.  We have a 73 minute cut, but have to raise finishing funds to complete it. Our goal of $35,000 will go towards:</p>

<h3>Vancouver Opera (VO) is Canada's second largest opera company and has been working in partnership with the local community since 1960. Since that time, our education and outreach initiatives have reached 1.75 million children and their families.</h3>
<p>From 2016-present, Vancouver Opera has been partnering with the Kettle, a Downtown Eastside based social services agency that focuses on supporting adults living with chronic mental illness and addiction-related conditions. Each week, VO chorus and music staff travel to The Kettle to conduct a regular choral and songwriting workshop with residents. The aim of this partnership is the creation of an on-site community choir, and a new opera entitled <i>Requiem for a Lost Girl.</i></p>
<p><i>Requiem for a Lost Girl </i>will be performed as part of the 2018 Vancouver Opera Festival at SFU Woodward's on May 4 and 6. This compelling work will feature personal stories of the Kettle residents and will allow the Kettle choir to perform in front of audiences. The healing work that has been achieved through this project is transformative, and the testimonials offered by the participants are heartwarming.</p>
<p>The positive impact that this project has had on everyone involved is significant and it’s very important that we keep this project going. The funds raised will be used to create a legacy program which will allow VO to continue sending our staff to the Kettle, with the ultimate goal of teaching their staff and volunteers how to run the program so that they can be independent.</p>
<p>Vancouver Opera is at the forefront of a global movement to improve lives through the arts. Our outreach initiatives don’t just improve lives locally, we’re inspiring change globally. Our work creates ripples that affect everyone and in a more practical sense, we’re creating partnerships and systems that can be replicated anywhere.</p>
<p>Why should you donate to this cause? Because you see the joy on the faces of the participants. You believe that everyone should have a voice. You know that small acts of kindness lead to big societal shifts. You want to make a difference—and you can.</p>
<p>On behalf of everyone at Vancouver Opera and the Kettle, please accept our sincere gratitude for your consideration. Please share this far and wide, and we hope to see you at the show!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Terra, and I live in Mount Airy, Maryland. If you've seen our town in the news recently, it's because it's become a hotspot for COVID-19. After getting over the initial stress of the pandemic coming to my hometown, I realized: I have a sewing machine, some extra fabric, a little skill, and some free time. ""I should get involved and make masks for healthcare workers,"" I thought.</p>
<p>So I called the nursing home where the outbreak was, and they said they were wearing N95 masks only, with fabric masks not needed from the community. I called some friends in other healthcare jobs, and they said the same. I even called the local food bank--they haven't gotten back to me yet, and aren't accepting non-monetary donations from the public at the moment.</p>
<p>Then I had to go out for groceries, and I saw someone with a towel tied around their face in lieu of a mask, and thought ""I should focus on the community, because that's where fabric masks can be most useful."" So I'm making masks, distributing them around the community where I see they are needed, and hopefully continuing to do this after everything reopens, because I think that the public wearing masks will be crucial to avoiding a second COVID-19 wave.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I Need Your Help</h3>
<p>For now, I am fortunate enough to be able to provide these masks for free--however, if I want to provide a meaningful quantity of masks, I will need all the help I can get from my recipients (and anyone you share the link with!). I'm currently furloughed from work, and I've spent a lot of my own time and money on materials so far. I'm glad I have the opportunity to give back to my community, but until my income source returns, I'll only be able to do so much. (Fortunately the state of Maryland's unemployment system is not as bad as some other states', but I've still had trouble with the website, so I haven't received benefits yet.)</p>
<p>All funds will go to me to recover the cost of the fabric and materials (about $200 so far) and help with my bills. If this campaign makes over $1000 in the 60 days it will run, all extra money will go to the Mt. Airy NET food bank--and honestly, after I pay for the fabric, I will try to make a donation no matter what, even if it's not a lot. Every little bit helps, both for me and everyone else.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges So Far</h3>
<p>I wanted to start distribution much earlier, but the project it a few snags along the way. I tried multiple prototypes to see which one would be the best fit for the most people, and I eventually settled on a slightly modified version of the UF Department of Anesthesiology Prototype 1... but it took a while to get there. (See my FAQ for the video link)</p>
<p>Then I spent hours cutting a certain fabric I had into dozens of squares... and I didn't find out that it wasn't breathable enough to use in masks until I made one and try it on. That was an annoying and slightly embarrassing lesson to learn, and I learned in on April 16th, two days before the new law in Maryland went into effect mandating face coverings when entering any retail store. Oops.</p>
<p>That unusable fabric represented a huge quantity of the fabric I had, so of course I had to go buy some, and... well, the supply at Wal-Mart has been decimated, of course. I wound up ordering online from Joann Fabrics (god love 'em, they're still doing curbside pick-ups) and I was able to order about $100 worth of fabric from them, although the supply was going quickly. I've had to improvise some fabric sources (i.e. I bought some bed sheets to cut up) but those are poly-cotton blends, rather than the recommended 100% cotton. But I had to do what I had to do, and I made sure to test everything this time to make sure it was breathable!</p>
<p>These challenges slowed me down, but did not stop me. I am in this for the long haul, because even after life returns back to normal--and despite what ANYONE says, we really don't know exactly when that will be--the need for masks will not disappear overnight. I will keep making them as long as they are needed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute any money, that's okay! I appreciate you taking the time to read this far! &lt;3</p>
<p>But you can still help me a lot by spreading the word to your friends, so that I can get more masks out there, and potentially more contributions. You can use the Indiegogo share tools, you can copy and paste the link to social media, you can text it to someone, you can send it in Morse Code to your quarantined neighbors--whatever works! Even just leaving a message is appreciated.</p>
<h3>A Word of Gratitude From Me</h3>
<p>If you found this link through receiving one of my masks, I hope it's nice and comfy, and it keeps you safe and healthy. If you found it through any other means, thank you for your time--it means a lot to me to have this opportunity to help people, and to have someone who hasn't even benefited from my hard work yet reading about it is pretty neat.</p>
<p>I've never really done any project like this before. I didn't take up the mask-making effort because I'm a particularly good or noble person, I don't think--it just seemed like the least I could do to help those around me, rather than sit around and waste all this time when I have the skill to help. I'm a pretty privileged person, all things considered, and I could've wound up in a much worse situation if this had happened at any other time. A lot of good things were going on in my life just before the pandemic, but a lot of them weren't time-sensitive, so they're just delayed, not outright cancelled. I would've been in a much worse situation if this had happened last year, or next year, or even maybe a few months from now (I was in the process of moving closer to work before this happened, but that's been put sorta on hold for now).</p>
<p>This has helped me re-evaluate how I look at myself as well--I didn't think I would have any skills that would be useful in a global-catastrophe situation, and I certainly didn't think I'd emerge as a hardworking person in a circumstance that forced everyone to stay home. And sure, I played my fair share of video games! But then I got to do this.</p>
<p>True story: as I was typing this section, I got a message of gratitude from a friend who had already received some masks from me. That was awesome.</p>
<p>So not only have I been quite lucky (despite being unemployed), but I am in a position to help others benefit from my relatively-good fortune. I hope these benefits are felt in my community, and I wish everyone the best. Stay safe, stay inside, and stay positive.</p>
<p>Love, Terra</p>

Hi, I'm Terra, and I live in Mount Airy, Maryland. If you've seen our town in the news recently, it's because it's become a hotspot for COVID-19. After getting over the initial stress of the pandemic coming to my hometown, I realized: I have a sewing machine, some extra fabric, a little skill, and some free time. ""I should get involved and make masks for healthcare workers,"" I thought.
So I called the nursing home where the outbreak was, and they said they were wearing N95 masks only, with fabric masks not needed from the community. I called some friends in other healthcare jobs, and they said the same. I even called the local food bank--they haven't gotten back to me yet, and aren't accepting non-monetary donations from the public at the moment.

Why I Need Your Help
For now, I am fortunate enough to be able to provide these masks for free--however, if I want to provide a meaningful quantity of masks, I will need all the help I can get from my recipients (and anyone you share the link with!). I'm currently furloughed from work, and I've spent a lot of my own time and money on materials so far.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>As most of you know, we've been offering mindfulness retreats on a fully voluntary basis for the last couple of years. We love this work and we've been touched by how meaningful these weeks can be. <strong>Our dream is to continue to offer retreats but we need a little help to get going.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lucy</strong>: <i>""When I started attending retreats, it felt like I was finally coming home; there was a deep sense of belonging which I hadn't been able to touch before. With time and patience, the wisdom from mindfulness &amp; self-compassion practices allowed me to come home anytime, no matter where I was or what I was going through. With this process, I began to touch joy, peace &amp; an open-hearted tenderness that I now carry with me even outside of retreat spaces. It would be a true privilege to share this gift with others having seen how transformational it was for me.""</i></p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong>: <i>"" Mindfulness has been personally transformational for me, helping me deal with anxiety, depression and find a sense of wholeness and purpose. Retreats don't just connect people to these life-changing practices, but help create a sense of belonging and connection to ourselves and the natural world. I've spent over 6 years living and working in retreat centers and it's clear we need more spaces where people can touch this sense of connection and well-being. Our dream is to work towards creating a fully residential retreat center, where people can come all year round. We'd be incredibly grateful for any help on our first steps towards this dream!""</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need £3,500 to contribute towards start up costs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>£1,300 for enough mats, cushions and blankets for at least 15 people</li>
<li>£300 for a selection of mindfulness books in our portable 'retreat library' to inspire our retreatants</li>
<li>£1,900 for deposits to secure venues in 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>We have already pooled our own resources to secure venues for 2019, but to secure beautiful venues for 2020 we need to put deposits down now (retreat spaces are often booked a year or more in advance)! This money will be re-invested each year into securing retreat locations in line with our ethos of promoting calm, tranquility, and connecting with nature.</p>
<p>As you know, financial accessibility is very important to the both of us, having both previously received help in attending retreats when we were students or financial unable to attend. Currently our pricing is limited by the cost of venue hire. Therefore any money raised beyond our £3,500 target will immediately create a bursary fund to help those in financial need.</p>
<h3>As a Thank You</h3>
<p>Our intention is to dedicate ourselves to supporting people in their mindfulness practice, and we love that we can offer perks as a thank you to those of you who are able to help! This includes everything from guided meditations and practices, to free places on our retreats. We are especially excited about our unique online 7 day home retreat, where we will offer daily guided meditations, practice inspiration and more!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our target, any donations will still be very gratefully received and will go towards the costs listed above, our priority being the mats and cushions for this year's retreats!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact You Can Make</h3>
<p>We have an in-depth understanding of mindfulness alongside the experience necessary to  skillfully guide groups into a deep retreat experience. We have also developed the behind-the-scenes skills of logistics, admin and other necessities that allows the smooth-running of a retreat. We have consistently received encouraging and positive feedback from over 600 retreatants so far. In addition we have been gifted the wonderful platform <a href=""http://www.mindfullivingretreats.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>Mindful Living Retreats</strong></i></a>. We are ready...We just need a little push start from you!</p>
<p>Your support will help us begin to create a small livelihood for ourselves so we can continue to offer these skills to benefit many more people. Anxiety, chronic stress, loneliness and depression continue to be pervasive problems for many people; we've seen first hand how practices like mindfulness and self-compassion can turn lives around. Our hope is to not only offer retreats and days of mindfulness, but also to develop free online courses to help people learn and integrate these practices into their daily lives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Our main challenge at the moment is :</p>
<ul><li>Finding quality and affordable venues where we can host retreats; eventually owning a venue would mean we can offer retreats in a much more affordable way but in the meanwhile we continue to do a lot of research in this area and would appreciate any suggestions.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are many non-monetary ways you can help us:</p>
<p>You can:</p>

Our intention is to dedicate ourselves to supporting people in their mindfulness practice, and we love that we can offer perks as a thank you to those of you who are able to help! This includes everything from guided meditations and practices, to free places on our retreats. We are especially excited about our unique online 7 day home retreat, where we will offer daily guided meditations, practice inspiration and more!
If we don't reach our target, any donations will still be very gratefully received and will go towards the costs listed above, our priority being the mats and cushions for this year's retreats!

The Impact You Can Make
We have an in-depth understanding of mindfulness alongside the experience necessary to  skillfully guide groups into a deep retreat experience. We have also developed the behind-the-scenes skills of logistics, admin and other necessities that allows the smooth-running of a retreat. We have consistently received encouraging and positive feedback from over 600 retreatants so far. In addition we have been gifted the wonderful platform Mindful Living Retreats. We are ready...We just need a little push start from you!
Your support will help us begin to create a small livelihood for ourselves so we can continue to offer these skills to benefit many more people. Anxiety, chronic stress, loneliness and depression continue to be pervasive problems for many people; we've seen first hand how practices like mindfulness and self-compassion can turn lives around. Our hope is to not only offer retreats and days of mindfulness, but also to develop free online courses to help people learn and integrate these practices into their daily lives.

Challenges
Our main challenge at the moment is :
Finding quality and affordable venues where we can host retreats; eventually owning a venue would mean we can offer retreats in a much more affordable way but in the meanwhile we continue to do a lot of research in this area and would appreciate any suggestions.

Other Ways You Can Help
There are many non-monetary ways you can help us:

Construction of a maternity Center in Lirembe Village in Kenya is a campaign that aims at assisting women to access better health care services during and after delivery because the nearest center is fifty miles away.
As contributors, you will be giving life to these women and their children because you will give them closer services than they had before. 


I intend to raise fifty thousand dollars that will assist me to build the maternity center in three phases. First, four rooms that will serve as pharmacy, consultation, ward and delivery room. Second, connect piped water in the facility. Third, add more rooms that will serve as more wards, kitchen and store. Finally, purchase a car as an ambulance.

<h1>Bref Résumé</h1>
<p>Je cherche à collecter 10000 € pour l'agrandissement de mon centre holistique qui aidera tous ceux qui cherchent à avoir la santé et bien-être au Cameroun.  Mes méthodes naturelles sont très sollicitées parmi non seulement les internationaux, mais de plus en plus les camerounais, car on prend conscience que la santé se trouve dans la nature.  Le centre sera l'oasis au milieu d'un monde trépidant et stressant, où l'on peut venir trouver le soin, la relaxation, la détoxification, et même les cours de l'alimentation saine.</p>
<h1><strong>Le Besoin</strong></h1>
<p>Au Cameroun, à cause de plusieurs facteurs socio-économiques et même culturels, la santé de beaucoup de monde se détériore inclus les enfants qui développent les maladies comme le diabète et l’obésité. L’obésité engendrent : les maladies cardio-vasculaires, la tension, le diabète, la faiblesse physique et sexuelle, la fatigue physique et mentale, et à la longue, les problèmes psychologiques comme le stress et la dépression, entre autres.  Et ce sont ces derniers qui sont le plus néfastes, parce qu’ils créent ou empirent les mêmes problèmes engendrés par l’obésité. Pire encore, les gens ne savent pas quoi faire pour rester en sante. Alors que faire ?</p>
<h2><strong>A propos de moi</strong></h2>
<p>Je suis Flore Ymélé HUNTER, et je suis spécialisée en <strong>Médicine Holistique</strong>.   Après avoir eu mon « Associate’s Degree » en science aux Etats-Unis, j’ai continué mes études pour devenir une guérisseuse.  J’ai suivi la formation en infirmerie pour avoir la certification d’une « <i>Licensed Vocationnel Nurse »</i> (LVN) avant de faire un apprentissage intense en <i>Acupuncture</i> et <i>Naturopathie</i>.  Ensuite, j’ai complété ma formation avec une certification en <i>Massage</i> et <i>Soin Corporel</i> que j’ai approfondi avec la connaissance de l’<i>Aromathérapie</i> et la <i>Nutrition</i>.  En tout, j’ai fait 7 ans des hautes études, avec plus de 9 ans d’expérience.  J’ai travaillé dans des spas de référence dans la zone urbaine de Washington DC, où j’ai perfectionné mes propres techniques thérapeutiques qui sont devenues extrêmement sollicitées et célébrées.</p>
<p>Avec la compréhension que tout dans la santé est connecté, j’ai mis ensemble des techniques thérapeutiques de la médecine traditionnelle Chinoise, Autochtone de l’Amérique, Indienne, Africaine et Japonaise pour ainsi créer une touche à moi que j’ appelle « Mboumi, » un mot qui signifie « le bien-être » dans ma langue natale.  Avec Mboumi, je résous tous les problèmes qui nous menacent en exerçant les techniques pour le traitement des malaises, des stress, de l’obésité ainsi que la réhabilitation après des attaques cardiovasculaire.  En plus, j’ai  développé  un programme de nutrition pour rester en sante et pour perdre le poids progressivement et naturellement sans pouvoir le regagner facilement.</p>
<h2><strong>Le Service</strong></h2>
<p>Avec l’expérience vécu aux USA concernant la santé humaine négligée, je n'aimerai pas que le Cameroun suit les mauvais pas des pays développés dans la négligence de leur santé.  Alors depuis trois ans, j’ai une clinique nommée  « Acupressure Wellness Center (AWT) » à Yaoundé, Cameroun, où j’adapte mes techniques pour le Cameroun.  Ma clientèle (composée des internationaux et nationaux) ne fait qu’accroitre, alors je vois que maintenant est le moment d’ajouter d’autres services en plus de la thérapie Mboumi pour avoir un vrai centre de bien-être : le Health Oasis. </p>
<p>Le Health Oasis sera composé non seulement du clinique AWT, mais aussi encore plus des massages relaxants, comme"" hot stones"" et ""hot towels"", soins de la peau, body scrubs et exfoliations pour la detoxification, et encore plus des sessions d’aromathérapie pour relaxer, tonifier, et équilibrer le corps.  En plus, il y aura le yoga et les cours de médiation, et surtout les cours de la nutrition et de l’alimentation saine.  Tout le monde, surtout les internationaux, veut manger la nourriture ethnique camerounaise avec tout son goût et ses saveurs.  Mais souvent la manière de la préparer n'est pas bien pour la santé car il y a beaucoup d'huile ou trop de sel.  J'apprends aux cuisiniers et à tout le monde des façons de cuisinier sainement sans perdre une goutte de la saveur camerounaise.  Avec tous ces services dans une espace tranquille, le Health Oasis sera un centre où les humains pourront s'y rendre pour se guérir et avoir une information et une éducation détaillée sur comment rester sain.</p>
<p>J’appelle le centre Health Oasis parce qu’il sera vraiment un sanctuaire tranquille et restaurateur.  En traversant le portail, le stress, les mouvements et bruits de la vie quotidienne à l’extérieur seront laissés loin de soi pendant qu’on est transporté à une espace sans soucis ou problèmes, où on trouve tout pour la santé et bien-être.</p>
<h1>L'impact</h1>
<p>Avec le Health Oasis, ceux qui cherchent à devenir ou rester sains auront finalement un lieu qui les comble.  Pour le moment, Yaoundé n’a rien : pas de parcs, pas d’espaces verts, pas d’endroits calmes retirés des voitures et des foules de gens qui doivent chercher leurs vies.  Alors une zone salubre où on peut méditer sans distraction aux solutions de l’avenir est nécessaire.  Le Health Oasis permettra à tout le monde de se retirer, même si c’est juste pour quelques moments précieux, pour se rétablir et retrouver son focus et son énergie.</p>
<p>De plus en plus, on relie le stress aux maladies graves et mortels, comme les crises cardiaques et la tension.  Mais en plus, une personne au bout de sa force n’a plus rien pour donner à ses enfants ou son époux, une réalité qui a des conséquences encore plus néfastes et touchantes.  Le ""Health Oasis"" redonne la vie à ceux qui se sentent dépassés en faisant que ces hommes et femmes redeviennent capables de faire leur mieux.  Et quelqu’un qui a la capacité de contribuer positivement à son lieu de service ou chez lui ou même au centre-ville peut changer le monde !</p>
<h2>Le Financement</h2>
<p>Je veux recueillir 10000 € pour faire mon nouveau centre de bien-être:</p>
<p>Les fonds servira à acheter:</p>
<ul>
<li> Des fournitures comme des armoires, les meubles de réception, deux tables en plus de traitements,</li>
<li> Des appareils; chauffe serviettes,le stérilisateur, le système audio, écran de télévision, réfrigérateur et cuisinière.</li>
<li>Plusieurs ustensiles de cuisine; Le mixeur, marmites, assietes, verres, couteaux ect.... pour compléter le fournissement de la nouvelle espace qui se trouve dans la région de Bastos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Si le fond est amassé avant le 5 Mai 2018, ça sera formidable car je pourrai acheter tous ces restes ustensiles et être prêt de commencer aussitôt dans le Health oasis  parce que mes clients et des autres membres de la communauté  attendent impatiemment  que ces services s’ouvrent pour améliorer leur dégustation et leur santé saine.  </p>
<p>Je suis passionné de continuer à améliorer la vie des gens -- de l'intérieur jusqu'à l'extérieur. Je crois qu'avec une bonne santé, on peut vivre plus longtemps et atteindre un meilleur objectif.  Votre gracieuse participation mettra l'humain ensemble et fera du monde un meilleur endroit.</p>
<p>S'il vous plaît, je sais que vous croyez en la bonne santé humaine. Alors aidez-moi à aider les gens qui cherchent une vie saine et durable en contribuant à mon projet. Et je vous prie de veiller inviter vos chers amis attentionnés à le faire aussi à travers indiegogo.</p>

<h3><strong>Be Part of a Good News Story</strong></h3>
<p>We're all feeling a bit trapped by circumstances these days. At Sundog Retreat, we don't expect many travellers this summer due to the border closures, and we're concerned about the economic downturn. With your help, we can provide jobs for Yukon people and increase local food production for Yukon families in need. Your support lets us build a large greenhouse and plant fresh vegetables for the Whitehorse Food Bank.</p>
<p>And it's a ""win-win"" when your perk is a stay at Sundog Retreat for a safe and healthy Yukon getaway. We've been #1 on TripAdvisor for good reason... now's your chance for a Canadian staycation (<a href=""https://www.sundogretreat.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sundogretreat.com</a>).</p>

<h3><strong>Short Season and Uncertain Times</strong></h3>
<p>We're learning a lot with a very short turnaround, and we certainly can't do it alone.</p>
<p>We're working collaboratively with local growers including our neighbours at the Yukon Grain Farm; with the Whitehorse Food Bank, Y2C2 youth, the Yukon College PIVOT program and some dedicated volunteers. We're also hiring Yukon people for our summer crew.</p>
<p>There's no guarantee of success, but we're taking a calculated risk because we know that this is a good time to diversify our business and begin growing food for our community.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have a proven track record with successful community projects that create good ""ripple effects"" and benefits. Our past successes include: </span></p>

<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">creating a commercial greenhouse and vocational skills for youth in Brazil (1992-1995)</span></li>

<li>founding the Northern Cultural Expressions Society / Dugout Canoe (est. 2005 - ongoing)</li>

</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>When we looked (with some shock!) at the tourism situation this spring, we viewed our agricultural property with a new sense of gratitude and possibility.</p>
<p>We're acting quickly to innovate and create a new livelihood that blends tourism and food production. We know that farming is a long-term investment and that it takes time to grow food well. And because we value community resilience, we want to work with other people to create a farm that feeds Yukon families, including the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>With your help we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>build a greenhouse 32' x 130' (with one end set up for processing)</li>
<li>plant potatoes, carrots, beets, turnips, peas, and beans </li>
<li>create an irrigation pond</li>
<li>harvest fresh veggies for the Food Bank and for sale to Yukon families</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>We need $25,000 towards the cost of a greenhouse. It'll cost more than that but we'll put some of our own savings into the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you contribute one of the ""veggie"" perks, you get the satisfaction of knowing that Yukon youth will work hard this summer to produce vegetables we'll give to the Whitehorse Food Bank at harvest time. </li>
<li>If you choose one of the ""vacation"" perks, you'll get a Whitehorse holiday with mountain views and a beautifully appointed cabin, as well as the satisfaction of supporting our greenhouse project.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your money will do even more good on its way to the Food Bank, by employing Yukoners and growing local food here at Sundog Retreat. All contributions to the project will help us increase food security (even if we don't meet our entire fundraising goal).</p>

<p>We know that in these unexpected times, people without work can't contribute by choosing a ""perk."" But you could still help us by:</p>

plant potatoes, carrots, beets, turnips, peas, and beans 
create an irrigation pond
harvest fresh veggies for the Food Bank and for sale to Yukon families

 

We need $25,000 towards the cost of a greenhouse. It'll cost more than that but we'll put some of our own savings into the project.

If you contribute one of the ""veggie"" perks, you get the satisfaction of knowing that Yukon youth will work hard this summer to produce vegetables we'll give to the Whitehorse Food Bank at harvest time. 
If you choose one of the ""vacation"" perks, you'll get a Whitehorse holiday with mountain views and a beautifully appointed cabin, as well as the satisfaction of supporting our greenhouse project.


Your money will do even more good on its way to the Food Bank, by employing Yukoners and growing local food here at Sundog Retreat. All contributions to the project will help us increase food security (even if we don't meet our entire fundraising goal).

 


Other Ways You Can Help
We know that in these unexpected times, people without work can't contribute by choosing a ""perk."" But you could still help us by:

Telling your friends and spreading the word
Volunteering to help with the project
Using the Indiegogo share tools (upper right: for FB, Twitter and a link for pasting into emails)

We've answered some common questions in our FAQ section. But if you have other questions please feel free to email sundogretreat@gmail.com - because we're all in this together, and your questions will make the project stronger!
Thank you so much for your support.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Our vision of Haum: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Haum is a welcoming space for intentional practice: classes, workshops, meditation, and training. More than anything, Haum exists so that everyone can connect with themselves, with community, and to ideas and experiences that bring us closer to our inner knowing. Our muse is the students. </p></li>
<li>At Haum, we believe everyone should experience the transformational journey of coming home to who they truly are. That’s where the magic happens.                                                              </li>
<li>Haum is an offering to our community as a way for us to connect again. Join us at Haum in the heart of the Mission, San Francisco. Open to all. Welcome home.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So what are we doing here?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Well, for starters we're opening up one of the only LGBTQ+ studios in SF. We will be creating programming that supports LGBTQ+ individuals (special workshops), classes that are inclusive. We're operating in 100% transparency for our teachers and we're paying our teachers right! Not only that but our space will serve as a community space for The Mission. We'll continue our partnership work with the Mission Resource Center to help provide resources for the underserved community. We're here to create safer spaces for all in the SF community. </li></ul>
<p><strong>We take care of our teachers.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Haum exists to support the practice and the exceptional teachers who make it possible. At Haum, we plan on evolving the structure for the way yoga teachers are treated in yoga spaces. We give our teachers space and freedom to do their thing, and we pay them what they deserve. It may seem simple, but it takes true dedication to make this happen.                               </li></ul>
<p><strong>We don’t just believe in local community; we are and act on it. </strong></p>
<ul><li>Haum is authentically San Francisco. We are a local, LGBTQ+ owned and operated business. We serve the Mission by bringing programming into the community, hosting an annual charity yoga event to raise funds for the underserved and engage daily with the community around us to identify new ways to make an impact. </li></ul>
<p><strong>We're going digital as well as in person!</strong></p>
<ul><li>Haum will be broadcasting all of its classes live streaming. We'll be building out a digital library so you can enjoy the hybrid model. Take a class with one of our amazing teachers at home or in person.</li></ul>
<p><strong>A letter from our founder, Danni: </strong></p>
<p>2020 was a pivotal year. It brought to the surface so much of what we’d hidden away and ignored. The past year created a vacuum, a silence that made space for us to truly listen.</p>
<p>As things were changing within us, the world outside was changing, too. So many of our community pillars were decimated. Major San Francisco yoga institutions were shuttered for good. We mourned our community, and we yearned for a space to exist in, a space in which to breathe together.</p>
<p>Beyond the pandemic, the world at large was challenging us to take a step back and imagine a brighter future. We had to open our eyes and envision the community we wanted to create when we reemerged. Even through my own deep depression, I could see true potential.</p>
<p>I imagined that when it was safe to gather again, I would welcome students into my living room to practice somewhere they could be comfortable, supported, and, most importantly, among friends. But, as time unfolded, I realized this was something bigger than my San Francisco studio apartment. Haum was born as a way for us to transition into a new future, together.</p>

<h3>What is Anenjavasa Retreat Meditation Center?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>It will be
the future Theravada Buddhist Monastery of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistoia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pistoia</a>, a city in Tuscany,
Italy. We have received it by a generous patron, that has given this place in
free loan to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pemananda.unapana?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rev. Unapana Pemananda Thero</a> (that you can see in the next photos) that will be the
spiritual director of the Monastery. With your help, we will restore it and
establish here a place to explore issues of faith and spirituality. </p>
<p>The
<a href=""http://www.anenjavasa.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anenjavasa Retreat Meditation Center</a> will be held by Buddhist Monks and it will be a place for many people, of all
religious faith, in the pure spirit of tolerance, kindness, compassion and
understanding of our common humanity. All will be welcome in this place, when it will be restored, regardless of race,
ethnicity, faith tradition, class, age, political party, education, gender,
marital status, physical or mental ability, sexual orientation, gender identity
or gender expression. </p>
<p>In Anenjavasa Retreat Meditation Center we will organize <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">meditation</a> retreats for people who desires to acquire mindfulness, that is the most important solution to many personal and social problems. Meditation is not part of a religion. Meditation is a technique of well living, is a way to calm the mind. Everyone can practice meditation without any kind of limits. </p>
<p><b>WHAT IS BUDDHISM?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Buddhism is a 
simple program, a kind of intellectual struggle that man has to sustain alone, 
with his own means, and where it can be successful winner. This program of 
existential battle is called <a href=""http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Four Noble Truths</a> and Buddha, for first, has 
applied it to himself, inferring it from his own experience and experiencing it 
personally.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p>
Buddha has tested 
directly the painful nature of existence, the caracteristic of this to be 
subject to disease, old age, death and to the pain that comes from not being 
with that with which you want to be, being with that which is not you would like, 
by not getting what you want. All the pains with which we come into daily 
contact can be grouped into one of three categories. Putting an end to them is 
the ultimate goal of Buddhism that teaches us how to deconstruct in us the 
source of all suffering, ignorance, acquiring, primarily, those correct views 
which allow us to eradicate the underlying causes of our suffering. </p>

<p>We are dreaming about: </p>
<ul>
<li>Dreaming about restoring the house you see in the photo so that you can establish there a monastery where, for the first time from when Pistoia has been foundend, in the far Roman era, three Theravada monks can reside, teaching to us, Westerners, the meditation, that is how to calm mind and to live happily, because happiness is the way .</li>
<li>Dreaming about the restoration of the house, generously given to Rev Unapana Pemananda Thero from a generous patron. The house is situated in a beautiful environment but now depopulated, like many mountain parts of Italy. We are absolutely sure that the Monastery will bring new life to this area, bringing up again even its economy.    </li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Dreaming of spread the Dhamma, the word of Buddha, that is very simple: Do the well, don't do the bad, purify your mind. The message is universal love, universal compassion, universal understanding that we are all part of the same life and this will teach people to respect every sentient being, huiman or animal.</span><br/>

attention towards the others. Now we need your help to raise the funds to get
<a href=""http://www.anenjavasa.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Anenjavasa Retreat Meditation Center</a> built and open for all. We need your
help to raise the $10000 to finish restoration. We have to buy bricks,
mortar, sand, cement, tiles for a new roof, distemper, replace the floors, redo
the windows, doors, electrical system and many others works. It seemed impossible, at the beginning of our dream, that someone could give us a place for nothing. This is happened. We are sure that with your help we will able to go on and to restore this old house, in a very francescan way, very simple, for our monks.  </p>

</div><div><h3><br/></h3></div></div>","What is Anenjavasa Retreat Meditation Center?

It will be
the future Theravada Buddhist Monastery of Pistoia, a city in Tuscany,
Italy. We have received it by a generous patron, that has given this place in
free loan to Rev. Unapana Pemananda Thero (that you can see in the next photos) that will be the
spiritual director of the Monastery. With your help, we will restore it and
establish here a place to explore issues of faith and spirituality. 
The
Anenjavasa Retreat Meditation Center will be held by Buddhist Monks and it will be a place for many people, of all
religious faith, in the pure spirit of tolerance, kindness, compassion and
understanding of our common humanity. All will be welcome in this place, when it will be restored, regardless of race,
ethnicity, faith tradition, class, age, political party, education, gender,
marital status, physical or mental ability, sexual orientation, gender identity
or gender expression. 
In Anenjavasa Retreat Meditation Center we will organize meditation retreats for people who desires to acquire mindfulness, that is the most important solution to many personal and social problems. Meditation is not part of a religion. Meditation is a technique of well living, is a way to calm the mind. Everyone can practice meditation without any kind of limits. 
WHAT IS BUDDHISM?

Buddhism is a 
simple program, a kind of intellectual struggle that man has to sustain alone, 
with his own means, and where it can be successful winner. This program of 
existential battle is called Four Noble Truths and Buddha, for first, has 
applied it to himself, inferring it from his own experience and experiencing it 
personally.




Buddha has tested 
directly the painful nature of existence, the caracteristic of this to be 
subject to disease, old age, death and to the pain that comes from not being 
with that with which you want to be, being with that which is not you would like, 
by not getting what you want. All the pains with which we come into daily 
contact can be grouped into one of three categories. Putting an end to them is 
the ultimate goal of Buddhism that teaches us how to deconstruct in us the 
source of all suffering, ignorance, acquiring, primarily, those correct views 
which allow us to eradicate the underlying causes of our suffering. 
In the following photos, the Rev. Unapana Pemananda Thero

We Are Dreaming
We are dreaming about: 

Dreaming about restoring the house you see in the photo so that you can establish there a monastery where, for the first time from when Pistoia has been foundend, in the far Roman era, three Theravada monks can reside, teaching to us, Westerners, the meditation, that is how to calm mind and to live happily, because happiness is the way .
Dreaming about the restoration of the house, generously given to Rev Unapana Pemananda Thero from a generous patron. The house is situated in a beautiful environment but now depopulated, like many mountain parts of Italy. We are absolutely sure that the Monastery will bring new life to this area, bringing up again even its economy.    

Dreaming of spread the Dhamma, the word of Buddha, that is very simple: Do the well, don't do the bad, purify your mind. The message is universal love, universal compassion, universal understanding that we are all part of the same life and this will teach people to respect every sentient being, huiman or animal.

For as long as I can remember I've always looked at things from a unique, sometimes unpopular, perspective. This ""tic"" in my nature didn't stop at the boundaries of polite society or the mainstream, but bled through into every aspect of my life, including physical culture. Seeing the limitations of strict, traditional, ""bro gym"" strength training in how it relates to grappling and real world practical applications, I sought out a different way. This quest for knowledge led me down the rabbit hole into the world of the kettlebell, and eventually, the Gada mace. These two implements completely changed the way I looked at strength training and I began to build a program, first for myself and then for others, that was built around these tools. I was the architect and alchemist of the Combat Conditioning program at the Indiana Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy, and that is there where magic began to take place. While I still coach that program, as well as Jiu-Jitsu, as part of our curriculum at IBJJA, my program began to outgrow the physical parameters of the space. I began to bend my mind toward a larger facility, able to handle my vision for what my creation was to become. An opportunity fell into my lap in the way of a perfect building in which to house an expanded version of what I had taken years to build at IBJJA. After praying to the Gods of iron and blood I received a series of signs that told me to throw caution to the wind and lay claim to this space...so I did just that. After a blood ritual and some offerings to Wotan, Iron &amp; Blood Strength and Conditioning was born. I've been working tirelessly to prepare Iron &amp; Blood S/C for the arrival of those who wish to surrender themselves to the process and become more powerful than they ever imagined. I'm close to the end and now I need your support to help make my creation accessible to the world. I don't believe in the weakness of begging, so what I offer is an exchange. Your contribution is an exchange for exclusive goods, and the opportunity to become part of something greater than yourself, something that spits in the eye of the modern world of hipster fitness clubs and soccer mom spin-class fuckery. I humbly thank you for your support and look forward to seeing you all on the other side. </p></div>","Greetings, my fellow outlaws and outliers, I'm Kyle Helsper.

I’ve been living now 12 years here in the beautiful Mexico and I’m one of the main orchestrators of this project;A holistic healing and wellbeing center under the name Nabaní (which means” to be alive “ in the native local language Zapoteco) in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. We are hoping to open our doors of our project in the coming months to everyone who is looking for holistic healing or a moment of well-being.The Project At the moment we are creating a place where you can learn, read or just relax in a good environment, free from worries.  The core ideas of Nabaní are:

Conscientious eating, we promote vegetarianism and we source a key part of our food from our own organic garden
Permaculture and sustainable living

Treatment with medicinal plants, essential oils and aroma touch massage

Physical movement through disciplines like Yoga and Kung Fu

Unprogramming of the mind

Energetic cleaning through the temazcal (a traditional Mayan sweat lodge), Holotropic Breath and Reiki
 We are also very fortunate to be supported by a clairvoyant shaman from the area who has many years of experience performing paranormal surgery. He is an expert in healing people with different illnesses, and even in some cases has cured illnesses which were apparently incurable.The Region of Oaxaca is an unique part in the world where ancient knowledge from pre-hispanic cultures such as Aztecan or Mayan are commonly found and used to promote better physical and emotional wellbeing. This includes such things as Shamanism, temazcales, healing with medical plants and ceremonies with natural hallucinogenic mushrooms. The essence of NabaníOur main aim is to be able to offer a space where you can unlearn a lot of the beliefs that have caused pain and discomfort, and throughout this process gaining the necessary tools so you can maintain your own physical and emotional wellbeing. We do this through our basic beliefs by eating consciously and taking care of one’s physical, emotional and spiritual states. You will become acquainted with the emotional root of your Conflict (the illness or everyday problems), and thus learn to eliminate them again. In short, you will learn to cure yourself, to clean your mind and to open yourself to new beliefs. Such a state isn’t only essential for everybody, but also in order to contribute to the creation of a new society with more free and healthier inhabitants. Support to the communityWe are situated in a small village in this beautiful valley near Oaxaca. The people here are very warm and natural, it's like a big family and we feel very blessed to know them. All the knowledge and ideas that we have, we share for free with the many interested people surrounding us, this includes;
Mental and energetically self healing
Ideas on permaculture and sustainable living
Creating vegetable gardens  and cultivating medicinal plants
Information on food science and good water nutrition
Teaching languages
Recycling
Corporal movements 
And the sharing of didactic wooden games for the children of the community.
Also we want to create more workplaces in the project and starting workshops in art and music .To Create a other idea of Happy living to be satisfied with himself and the nature .Where are we so farThe project is advancing at a good pace. Currently we are building visitors’ accommodation through ecological concepts, where we hope to offer space for up to 8 people. And we are in the final stages of building an earthbag dome and a wood cabin with a green roof. We also working always in extend our medicinal plant garden  and in free times we elaborating decorations and art made from precious stones and wood.  Right now we are finishing the construction of a clay pizza oven. We have been working on this project essentialy with volunteers coming from more than 15 different countries.  In addition, we plan to build dry toilets, a temazcal made from earth, a small natural pool, another wood cabin,  extra shower, an expansion of our medicinal plant garden and the Therapy room for the shaman made from clay , beeing able to work in a good condition.                             The goalUltimately, this is a project by people for people thinking that living a full life is possible and we enjoy our work with this in mind. In the longer term, the idea is to buy another larger piece of land closer to the Oaxacan coast, allowing us to receive more guests and have more space for medicine plants and vegetables . We would like to open the project up to anyone who would like to offer their help to us. There are many other different areas that we would like to include (handcraft, circus, music,...).If you want to become part of our work, we are always open for collaboration with the aim of making the world a better place. We have invested so much love, sweat and dreams into Nabani’, but with your support we will be able to go so much further with our project. We’re waiting for you with open arms and hearts! Why are we doing this indiegogo campaign? The project is going well but we still have much to advance.Actually, we need donations to be able to keep going. What we need the donations for:Finishing the construction of the last natural shaped wooden cabin, finishing our temazcal ,the small natural pool and the healing/ therapy area.                                                         We also need more materials to be able to craft furnitures for the cabins, solar pannels, solar heaters, dry toilets and another outdoor shower.                                        In the end, if the donations are enough, we would also need a small bus to pick you up                                              and drop you at the beautiful places and the wonderful nature surrounding us.  Hierve el aqua  Monte Alban  Mountain Lake Teitipac  In terms of numbers : Finishing the Temazcal                                                   1000 Dollars2nd wooden cabin with bathroom and dry toilet      2200 DollarsNatural pool with waterfall                                             2000 DollarsYoga area and materials, plants                                    300 DollarsOutdoor shower for the Temascal                                300 Dollars2 solar panel, heater for the 3 cabins                          1000 DollarsWood for  furniture                                                          600 DollarsFinishing the area for paranormal surgery                 800 DollarsLittle bus                                                                            1800 Dollars By donating and helping us you will be a part of this special project and will also be helping the people here in the local communities surrounding us to get access to important  information and free healing. This will quite simply change their lives, and as they share this experience with others, the information will spread  and spread like a positive virus. “ Because Man sacrifices his health in order to make money, he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.” - The Dalai Lama You are invited to follow us on our Facebook page , 'Nabani Healing Center ,to see the evolution of the project and the see the implementation of the final constructions .https://www.facebook.com/NabaniHealingCenter/ Thank you in advance for your support, and see you soon ._____________________________________________________ Text in Deutsch Ganzheitliches Heil- und Wellnesszentrum ""Nabani' ""Hallo, ich bin Thomas aus Deutschland. Ich lebe jetzt seit 12 Jahren hier im schönen Mexiko und ich bin einer der Organisatoren dieses Projekts:Ein ganzheitliches Heil- und Wellnesszentrum unter dem Namen Nabani ' im Bundesstaat Oaxaca, Mexiko.(""Nabani‘"" bedeutet in der einheimischen Sprache Zapotec „lebendig“) . Und wir hoffen, in den kommenden Monaten unsere Türen dieses Projektes für alle öffnen zu können, die ganzheitliche Heilung oder einen Moment des Wohlbefindens suchen.Das ProjektIm Moment erstellen wir einen Ort, an dem Sie in einer schönen Umgebung lernen, lesen oder einfach nur entspannen können, ohne Sorgen zu haben. Die Kernideen von Nabani sind: - Gewissenhaftes Essen. Wir fördern Vegetarismus und wir beziehen einen wesentlichen Teil    unseres Essens aus unserem eigenen Bio-Garten- Permakultur & nachhaltiges Leben- Behandlung mit Heilpflanzen, ätherischen Ölen und Aroma-Touch-Massage- Körperliche Bewegung durch Disziplinen wie Yoga und Kung Fu- Mentale Desprogramation- Energetische Reinigung durch die Temazcal (traditionelle Maya-Schwitzbad), holotropes Atmen und ReikiWir sind auch sehr glücklich, von einem hellsichtigen Schamanen aus der Gegend unterstützt zu werden, der seit vielen Jahren paranormale Operationen durchführt. Er ist ein Experte in der Heilung von Menschen mit verschiedenstenen Krankheiten und hat sogar in einigen Fällen Krankheiten geheilt, die anscheinend unheilbar waren.Die Region Oaxaca ist ein einzigartiger Ort auf der Welt, wo antikes Wissen aus der Maya- und Azteken-Kultur, Temazcal, Schamanismus, Behandlung mit Heilpflanzen und Heilzeremonien mit natürlichen bewusstseinsverändernden Pilzen als normale Behandlungen gelten , um eine bessere Gesundheit zu schaffen.Die Essenz von NabaniUnser Hauptziel ist es, Ihnen einen Raum zu bieten, in dem Sie viele der Überzeugungen die Schmerzen und Unbehagen in ihrem  Leben verursacht haben, verlernen können. Während dieses Prozesses erhalten Sie die notwendigen Werkzeuge, damit Sie selbst Ihr körperliches und emotionales Wohlbefinden aufrechterhalten können. Wir tun dies durch unsere Grundüberzeugungen, indem wir bewusst essen und auf die physischen, emotionalen und spirituellen Zustände achten.Sie werden die emotionale Wurzel ihres Konfliktes ( der Krankheit oder Alltagsproblemen ) kennenlernen, und somit auch lernen diese wieder zu beseitigen .Kurz gesagt, Sie werden lernen, sich selbst zu heilen, Ihren Geist zu reinigen und sich neuen Überzeugungen zu öffnen.Ein solcher Zustand ist nicht nur für jeden erwünschenswert, sondern auch wichtig, um bei der Schaffung einer neuen Gesellschaft, mit mehr freien und gesünderen Einwohnern, beizutragen.Unterstützung für die EinheimischenWir leben in einem kleinen Dorf in der Nähe von Oaxaca in einem schönen Tal. Die Menschen hier sind sehr herzlich und natürlich. Und in den letzten Jahren haben wir hier viele Freunde gefunden. Es ist wie eine große Familie.All unser Wissen und unsere Ideen teilen wir immer kostenlos mit den lokalen Freunden und interessierten Menschen, die uns umgeben,wie zum Beispiel : - geistige und energetische Selbstheilung- Permakultur und nachhaltiges Leben- Wissen über Gemüsegärten & medizinische Pflanzen- Ernährungswissenschaft & guter Umgang mit Wasser- Sprachunterricht- Recycling- Körperbewegungen wie Yoga & Kung Fu- Das beibringen von didaktische Holzspiele für die Kinder der Gemeinde.Unser Ziel ist auch mehr Arbeitsplätze im Projekt zu schaffen für die Einheimischen ,und Workshops in Kunst und Musik zu beginnen, um den Menschen hier eine andere Vorstellung des glücklichen Lebens zu schaffen, und um mit sich selbst und mit der Natur in Einklang zu sein.Wo stehen wir jetzt?Das Projekt schreitet gut voran. Derzeit bauen wir die Unterkünfte für unsere Gäste, erstellt nach einem ökologischen Konzept, in denen wir Platz für bis zu 8 Personen bieten können. Aktuell sind wir dabei ein rundes Erdhaus und eine Holzhütte mit grasbewachsenem Dach fertigzustellen .Unseren Heilfplanzengarten sind wir auch ständig am vergrössern.  Und in unseren freien Momenten kreieren wir Dekorationen und Kunst aus Edelsteinen und Holz. Gerade sind wir dabei einen neuen Brot- und Pizza-Ofen aus Lehm fertigzustellen. Darüber hinaus planen wir den Bau von Trockentoiletten, einem Temazcal aus Lehm, einem kleinen Naturpool, einer weiteren Holzhütte,  zusätzlichen Freiduschen, einem Therapieraum aus Lehm und die Erweiterung unseres Heilpflanzengartens.                              Wir arbeiten an diesem Projekt hauptsächlich mit einheimischen freunden und freiwilligen Helfern aus mehr als 15 verschiedenen Ländern.Das ZielLetztendlich ist dies ein Projekt von Menschen für Menschen, die glauben, dass ein Leben in völliger Zufriedenheit möglich ist und deshalb genießen wir auch unsere Arbeit. Für die Zukunft wollen wir ein weiteres größeres Stück Land näher an der Küste von Oaxaca erwerben, um mehr Gäste empfangen zu können und um auch mehr Platz für Früchte, Gemüse und Medizinpflanzen zu haben.Wir möchten das Projekt jedem öffnen, der uns seine Hilfe anbieten möchte. Es gibt so viele andere Bereiche, die wir gerne einbeziehen würden (Handwerk, Zirkus, Musik, ...) Wenn Sie Teil dieses Projekts werden wollen, sind wir immer offen für eine Zusammenarbeit mit dem Ziel, die Welt zu einem besseren Ort zu machen. Wir haben so viel Liebe, Schweiß und Träume in Nabani 'investiert, aber mit Ihrer Unterstützung werden wir in der Lage sein, mit unserem Projekt noch viel weiter zu gehen.

<p> </p>
<p>Hello, My name is DJ Thielen, CEO  / Entrepreneur / Ex-Professional Athlete / Motivational Speaker / Influencer.  I hope you enjoy my story and mission to have an Academy VIA an App for our  ""LIFE AFTER SPORTS -Success Academy"" where we will provide:</p>
<p>1.  Mentorship from Celebrities and Professional Athletes both current and past.</p>
<p>2. Personal Development from some of the BEST Personal Development Trainers in the World.</p>
<p>3.  A 24-7 Crisis help line for people suffering from PTSD, Depression, Drugs, and Alcohol Addiction.</p>
<p>4.  ""TEAM"" Video Conference Calls Every WEEK With Mindset, Business, Success, And A NEW Topic Each Week To Inspire / Educate / And Motivate.</p>
<p>5. A Step By Step Training Module System on HOW TO : Set A NEW Vision For Their Lives / Manifest Good Things  /  Be Happy Consistently / Re-Wire The Brain For Success After Sports /  Create Their Own Successful Business / Be Part Of A Team Again And Network &amp; Community Overcoming The Same Challenges (Very Important) / Have Accountability Partners / Create A NEW And Amazing Successful Life / Testimonials &amp; Success Updates Continuously To Inspire &amp; Give Hope.....And Much More!      </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How good would that feel to be part of something that impacts Millions of ex-athletes be able to feel confident again and have a mission, purpose, and amazing life after sports?</strong></p>
<p>You see, growing up I always dreamed of being a ""Professional Baseball Player"" and in 1991 I was fortunate to fulfill that dream when I was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 6th round of the Major League Baseball draft when I was only 19 years old.  Not understanding how important the Mental Side of the game was I had tremendous highs and incredible lows and ended up leaving the game in 1996 going from Top Prospect to working in a warehouse for minimum wage.</p>
<p>I felt defeated like a total failure and I didn't want to be around old friends or go to places I grew up.  I felt lost, alone, frustrated, mad, and constantly wondered what if!  I had NO education to fall back on and it didn't matter anyways because my ADD didn't particularly allow me to like school very much:).  Year by year things got better and I realized the same things that were important to be a HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ATHLETE were the same things that would lead me to success in the Real World. I saw that Being consistent, being positive, expecting good things,  continuously getting better, having a mentor, personally developing, and outworking my competition would allow me to be successful in this NEW WORLD and even though I had NO degree and wasn't the most talented I could still ""Make it"".  The only thing was this took me 20 plus years to really understand because I had to figure these things all out on my own.</p>
<p>I can look back and see that had I known what I know now I could have achieved MASSIVE success in 1 year as opposed to 20 and I want to share these ""Secret Success Hacks"" with others that have left sports, feel lost, and want success after sports BUT don't know where to turn.  </p>
<p>I recently heard of a good friend of mine that was a high round baseball draft pick and committed suicide. I was shook up over this as I heard he just never got over not making it to the Major Leagues so I dove in and what I uncovered is an untalked about MASSIVE EPIDEMIC.

How good would that feel to be part of something that impacts Millions of ex-athletes be able to feel confident again and have a mission, purpose, and amazing life after sports?
You see, growing up I always dreamed of being a ""Professional Baseball Player"" and in 1991 I was fortunate to fulfill that dream when I was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 6th round of the Major League Baseball draft when I was only 19 years old.  Not understanding how important the Mental Side of the game was I had tremendous highs and incredible lows and ended up leaving the game in 1996 going from Top Prospect to working in a warehouse for minimum wage.
I felt defeated like a total failure and I didn't want to be around old friends or go to places I grew up.  I felt lost, alone, frustrated, mad, and constantly wondered what if!  I had NO education to fall back on and it didn't matter anyways because my ADD didn't particularly allow me to like school very much:).  Year by year things got better and I realized the same things that were important to be a HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ATHLETE were the same things that would lead me to success in the Real World. I saw that Being consistent, being positive, expecting good things,  continuously getting better, having a mentor, personally developing, and outworking my competition would allow me to be successful in this NEW WORLD and even though I had NO degree and wasn't the most talented I could still ""Make it"".  The only thing was this took me 20 plus years to really understand because I had to figure these things all out on my own.
I can look back and see that had I known what I know now I could have achieved MASSIVE success in 1 year as opposed to 20 and I want to share these ""Secret Success Hacks"" with others that have left sports, feel lost, and want success after sports BUT don't know where to turn.  
I recently heard of a good friend of mine that was a high round baseball draft pick and committed suicide. I was shook up over this as I heard he just never got over not making it to the Major Leagues so I dove in and what I uncovered is an untalked about MASSIVE EPIDEMIC. I learned there are MILLIONS of people that leave sports and are suffering from drug addiction, alcohol addiction, PTSD, suicidal thoughts, depression, and just feel stuck and I felt a massive pulling on my heart to create an Academy that will SOLVE THIS PROBELM FOR THEM Instantly saving lives, changing peoples destiny's, and helping them have SUCCESS after sports immediately became my mission.
As a contributor and giver to this cause, YOU will be helping athletes from ALL AROUND THE WORLD be able to not get addicted to drugs, not become an alcoholic, not have PTSD....BUT rather immediately plug into a Community of support, personal development, business training, mentoring from Professional Athletes and Celebrities, and be able to create a life of Success rather than Failure.

<h3>About Jasmine and SHAKTIBARRE</h3>
<p>I am <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jmacbeautywellness/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jasmine McCarthy</a>, one of <a href=""http://www.shaktibarre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SHAKTIBARRE's</a> founding teachers, and would love your support in<strong> raising $9,600 to open my own accessible, sustainable yoga-barre empowerment hub </strong>–<strong> this time in further south into Brooklyn! </strong>For all the students who've been asking in class and over Instagram/email/text what I mean by ""further south into Brooklyn,"" I'm currently in lease negotiations for an awesome spot in Dumbo. By the way, this will be SHAKTIBARRE's 3rd location and I'm thrilled to next-level partner with them.</p>
<p>I want to continue <strong>championing diversity within boutique fitness</strong>, achieve a greater level of <strong>professional and financial autonomy </strong>so that I may soon start a family, and relentlessly <strong>emphasize movement as a tool that helps many find their voice</strong> where it is otherwise silenced. Having grown with SHAKTIBARRE for 24 months, I can't think of a better organization to partner with in the name of <strong>inclusivity, women's rights, and exercise.</strong></p>

<p><i>[Teaching at SHAKTIBARRE WILLIAMSBURG on a Friday morning]</i></p>
<p>Since joining SHAKTIBARRE in December of 2016 after my now-husband pointed me to it (and then I took tons of classes, one day virtually auditioning myself by providing a barre playlist to Liz when the internet was down), <strong>my leadership skills have accelerated in these ways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brought in and taught nearly 16% of SHAKTIBARRE's total clientele (for perspective, that's the 2nd highest on the whole team!)</li>
<li>Maintained a 4.8/5 star rating across 1590 reviews</li>
<li>Successfully continued my 7 year role as Manager of Downtown Dance Factory</li>
<li>Excelled in every interview and deliverable necessary to co-own a SHAKTIBARRE studio</li>
</ul>
<p>By building a SHAKTIBARRE in South Brooklyn, <strong>I will also extend my partner organization's 29 month reputation of offering exceptional barre and yoga classes at sliding-scale prices</strong> – a mission that already brought accessible movement to over 10,000 students in Williamsburg and Harlem, increased said impact globally via 35 press hits, and won awards such as Brooklyn Magazine's Top 100 Culture Influencers and 9 Impressive Women in Fitness Making an Impact in the Industry (SELF, 2017). </p>

<li>$9,600 is the 20% capital I need to secure a $38,400 small business loan</li>

<li>With $120,000 total (exact startup costs to open a location), I'll be able to open my SHAKTIBARRE</li>

<h3>Feeling confident about your contribution</h3>
<p>Over 10 years of fitness-management experience (Downtown Dance Studio being one of them), running my own beauty and wellness business on the side as a Younique affiliate, and being one of SHAKTIBARRE's most successful Master Teachers all helped me to confidently take the leap into owning a studio. <strong>Additionally, these are some extra confidence-boosters that help you and I both feel strongly about SHAKTIBARRE #3's favorable outcome:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>With my co-founders investing $72,000 in my studio, we also have an Operating Agreement where they're responsible for mentoring me, building out barre and yoga trainings (read: additional streams of revenue for SHAKTIBARRE South Brooklyn to keep class prices affordable to all), and we're all liable for location #3. Also, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/shaktibarre-expands-to-harlem"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>they've done this twice before</u></a> (; </li>
<li>As an owner of the studio, I have full authority to hire my own Manager, his/her assistant, and team of stellar teachers and work-study ambassadors. In fact, I've already begun the interview process for some of these roles and am focused on hiring a talented, dedicated, and reliable team to complement my track record of leadership. Did you know SHAKTIBARRE employs up to 25 people per studio? It's exciting to think about creating more jobs for women like me, too!</li>
<li>If I don't meet my goal, I'll put 100% in an escrow account until I can save the money (keep in mind this will take me an estimated 18 months, which means students who've been inquiring about a SHAKTIBARRE in South Brooklyn will have to wait even longer for affordable, sustainable workout classes and an irreplaceable community with which to experience them).</li>

<h2>A Movement of BLOOMERS</h2>
<p>Currently we are moving towards the tipping point, where more of us are beginning to remember our connection to the natural world and our essential goodness.  We are arriving on the planet with multiple and seemingly divergent gifts at a time when the technologies with which to communicate these gifts are pervasive. Increasingly too, we have begun to make bold choices to pursue these diverse and seemingly discordant passions with authenticity. In so doing, we are challenging the ways we identify ourselves, do business, create art, build communities, organize politically, love, parent and spend our time.</p>
<p><strong>BLOOM is a movement of people who are seeking to live more authentic lives as we deliver unique and urgently needed gifts to world.</strong> We<strong> </strong>are global citizens who are finding innovative ways of responding to the evolutionary changes of our time for their own survival.</p>
<p>We are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative and Social Entrepreneurs</li>
<li>People who are juggling jobs as they create their own enterprises.</li>
<li>We are people with stressful careers who are seeking to reinvent and bring balance to the way they live and work.</li>

<p><i>""There are good coaches out there who respond to ""How do I get what I want?""  Olu's work awakens us to the fulfillment of a greater, ascending form of attainment.  His words activate the answers that already reside in each of us to a much more purposeful question: 'What is Life asking of me?' This book is an answer to a collective sacred prayer.  It holds gifts that we need, right now."" </i><strong>~ Kinshasa Carvalho </strong></p>
<p><i> “Olubode is the twenty-first century go-to person for artists who want to realize their creative possibility. As a composer and creator of digital content for film, television, recording, and the Internet, whenever I am faced with a problem that I don’t understand, I rely on him to listen intently and to ask the questions that get me moving. He is a powerful mix of creativity, business, and spirituality. His counsel has helped me to move forward boldly, and continuously.”</i> ~ <strong>Patrick Gandy</strong>, Composer, Los Angeles California</p>
<p><i>“</i><i>The Essential Journey was my path to personal and professional transformation, healing, and purposeful life mapping. This process of self discovery and renewal helped me to find my true voice and essential self in a meaningful dance of light and shadow, by boldly facing and faithfully embracing all parts of myself – my essence and my desires- in ways that empowered, ennobled, and energized my dreams, goals, and desires for myself and the world around me. It was simply a mystical experience.”</i> <strong>~ Tyrone Fitzgerald</strong> ~ Attorney-at-Law</p>
<p><i> “This Journey has been incredibly fruitful for me. Writing felt like rest — my desk actually became a place of rest and simplicity. I have never ever experienced anything like that.

</div></div>","A Movement of BLOOMERS
Currently we are moving towards the tipping point, where more of us are beginning to remember our connection to the natural world and our essential goodness.  We are arriving on the planet with multiple and seemingly divergent gifts at a time when the technologies with which to communicate these gifts are pervasive. Increasingly too, we have begun to make bold choices to pursue these diverse and seemingly discordant passions with authenticity. In so doing, we are challenging the ways we identify ourselves, do business, create art, build communities, organize politically, love, parent and spend our time.
BLOOM is a movement of people who are seeking to live more authentic lives as we deliver unique and urgently needed gifts to world. We are global citizens who are finding innovative ways of responding to the evolutionary changes of our time for their own survival.
We are:

Creative and Social Entrepreneurs
People who are juggling jobs as they create their own enterprises.
We are people with stressful careers who are seeking to reinvent and bring balance to the way they live and work.

I have written a book for us, so that together we can keep ourselves well and growing, as we deliver some amazing gifts to the planet.
This book seeks to inform, inspire and celebrate this movement, as too often we are delivering our gifts at the expense of the things that matter most: our well-being, close relationships, community, family and fun.
 
New Thinking
Much of this book is new thinking emerging from ancient truths and refined for modern ears. 

In this book, the five elements:  MINERAL, NATURE, FIRE, WATER & EARTH -- the elements that support all living things – are used as metaphors:

to give us a language we can ALL understand,
to help us discover the things that make us BLOOM
it is a language we can use to support each other on as we journey.

In this book, they are used to help us discover.

The 5 LIFE NUTRIENTS - the pillars of spiritual and psychological health that keep us well and growing.
The 5 LIFE AREAS in which ALL human beings have activities that provides a new paradigm of life balance.
25 NEW PERSONALITY ARCHETYPES that will help us better understand how our best qualities become our shadows when stressed and how to keep ourselves evolving.
THE FIVE DRAGON FEARS that keep us stuck and how to identify and confront the ones to that keep us stuck.

 
What You Will Learn
Through stories, insight inducing exercises and processes you will learn:

How to listen more closely for your OWN voice
How to negotiate change that threatens your identity or self concept
How to see more clearly your light and your shadows and be more authentic and available to others.
How to better understand the nature of conflict, and how to use it deepen relationships
How to feel more at home in your own body and move forward more confidently in the world.



 
Are you a BLOOMER? (Take this test!)


ARE YOU NEEDING TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP but, not knowing how and without a clear path ahead, you face-off with of SELF-DOUBT and CONFUSION?

ARE WANTING TO MAKE A CHANGE but right now you toggle between FEELING STUCK on the one hand, and BEING NO LONGER IN CONTROL, on the other?

YOU MUST NOW BE VISIBLE FOR THE THINGS YOU BELIVE IN, but you fear, that folks will not buy it, or get you for that matter?

DO YOU NEED A TEAM but are wary of the feelings of  ABANDONMENT or BETRAYAL that comes with conflict and departure?

DO YOU DESIRE TO HAVE IT ALL but have you ever wondered, how will you manage it all?  

If you can relate to any of this, you are a BLOOMER too!

Our HEALTH and WELL BEING on one hand, and on the other,

<p><strong>About Paula</strong></p>
<p>Paula Castro is our beautiful 7 years-old daughter. When she was 3 months old she had strong convulsions that left her with cerebral damage and was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>We knew our lives would change radically; Paula didn’t act or behave as other kids her same age. She was aggressive, didn't respond to her name and just wanted to be alone. She began preschool when she was 4 and her differences with other kids became more evident; we knew that something was wrong and we suspected it was something additional to cerebral palsy; Paula had a lot of difficulty following instructions and was unable to stay still. In school they didn't know how to help Paula and as her mom, I often found myself telling teachers what and how to deal with her, even though she had a shadow teacher.  Doctors suggested that in addition to suffering from cerebral palsy, Paula was autistic.</p>
<p><strong>Paula's Education</strong></p>
<p>In our desperation we discovered Monarch, a therapeutical-educational institution that works with children with neurological disorders. Monarch had demonstrated success with other children like Paula.  I understood that to enable Paula to have a more regular life in which whe could learn how to relate to others and have the possibility of eventually adapting to society, she had to attend Monarch. My family and I decided to pour our savings and make the extraordinary effort to gather the resources for Paula to attend  this institution. We gathered  enough for her first year’s therapies.   </p>
<p>I am confident that we made the right decision. We have seen great improvements in Paula as a result of the intensive therapies she receives in Monarch: she now can look me straight in the eye and call me ""Mommy"". She can express when she is hungry or cold. As time passes her crisis are shorter and farther apart. We can now take her out on errands without fearing a crisis from the multiple stimulus she receives from common noise and lights. Our hearts are now filled with joy and our family life has changed dramatically. Monarch has deeply changed our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Help Us</strong></p>
<p>The joy and happiness that comes with a newborn child turned into fear after paula was diagnosed; fear of her always being dependant of her parents and of caregivers. We feared she would depend on us even for the easiest activities. She has already started to develop the tools and abilities she needs that will allow her to become less dependent of others. We need your help so Paula can continue to receive her therapies, which have an annual cost of $9,000.  We have invested all of our family’s savings for her to attend Monarch for one year. We know there is no other choice for our daughter and with the help of the people that understands our story, we can make this happen.</p>
<p>We thank all the good hearts that have decided to be part of our story and help us to help Paula develop the tools she will need to have a more happy, independent and meaningful life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Acerca de Paula</strong></p>
<p>Paula Marcela Castro Balcarcel es nuestra hermosa hija de 7 años. A los 3 meses de edad, después de una convulsión que la dejó con el hemisferio izquierdo afectado, fue diagnosticada con parálisis cerebral leve.</p>
<p>A partir de ese momento supimos que nuestra vida cambiaría radicalmente; Paula no se mostraba igual que otros niños de su edad: no respondía a su nombre, solamente quería estar aislada y era un poco agresiva.  A los 4 años cuando inició el preescolar y estas diferencias eran cada vez más evidentes; sabíamos que algo no estaba bien, sospechábamos que había algo más que parálisis. Paula tenía mucha dificultad para seguir instrucciones, no podía estar quieta y aprendía de forma y a un ritmo diferente.</p>
<p>Nos sugirieron que Paula, además de la parálisis cerebral, presentaba conductas de un niño dentro del espectro autista. La situación en su colegio cada vez era más frustrante, pues no sabían cómo tratar a Paula y era yo la encargada de decirles qué hacer y cómo hacerlo a pesar de haber tenido maestra sombra.</p>
<p><strong>La educación de Paula</strong></p>
<p>Cuando nos enteramos del enfoque terapéutico-educativo de Colegio Monarch y del éxito que han tenido otros niños y jóvenes que han sido atendido allí, mi familia y yo decidimos hacer esfuerzos extraordinarios para que Paula pudiera asistir a esa institución. Logramos reunir lo suficiente para su primer año.  </p>
<p>Desde que Paula está en Monarch, hemos visto cambios notorios,  ya me dice “mami” viéndome a los ojos, puede expresar cuando tiene hambre  y frío, cada vez controla un poco mejor sus crisis, y estamos convencidos que sin el apoyo que recibe en Monarch, no hubiéramos observado estos avances tan pronto.  Son cosas que nos llenan de alegría pues pensamos todo esto estaba muy lejos, si no imposible, de suceder.  Monarch nos ha cambiado la vida a todos.</p>
<p><strong>Ayúdanos</strong></p>
<p>Con el nacimiento de un hijo, se tiene grandes expectativas y en nuestro caso conservamos el temor de que siempre van a necesitar de nosotros incluso para las actividades más sencillas, sino desarrolla las herramientas y destrezas que la hagan una niña tan independiente como sea posible.  Es por eso que necesitamos su ayuda, Paula necesita apoyo para que pueda continuar recibiendo la apoyo terapéutico-educativo que recibe en Monarch; sabemos que no hay otra opción para nuestra hija  y solo con la ayuda de personas que se sensibilizan ante nuestra historia, podremos hacer  esto realidad.</p>
<p>Agradecemos desde ya a todos aquellos buenos corazones que decidan ser parte de nuestra historia y ayudarnos a que Paulita logre obtener todas las herramientas para tener una vida más independiente y feliz.</p>

The YWCA Knoxville, a 501(c)3 local non-profit organization, was founded in 1899 with the mission of “eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all.” The YWCA has many programs to end racism and better the greater Knoxville youth; one of these ways is through their SKIP program.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490548893/dvq9qnptmaqdgilixiof.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3>The Project</h3><p>YWCA’s Summer Kids in Play, or SKIP, is a summer program that offers a safe and fun place for kids between the ages of 5-14 to learn valuable skills and to develop their character. During the program, kids take swimming classes, cooking classes, complete summer reading challenges, and more. This summer program is great for busy parents, and for those who want their kids to continue learning in an exciting and educational environment.</p><p> </p><p>The price for each child to go to camp for one week is $85. Many families, however, cannot afford to send their kids to SKIP, so our goal is to raise $1,300 to help them out.

The YWCA Knoxville, a 501(c)3 local non-profit organization, was founded in 1899 with the mission of “eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all.” The YWCA has many programs to end racism and better the greater Knoxville youth; one of these ways is through their SKIP program.  The ProjectYWCA’s Summer Kids in Play, or SKIP, is a summer program that offers a safe and fun place for kids between the ages of 5-14 to learn valuable skills and to develop their character. During the program, kids take swimming classes, cooking classes, complete summer reading challenges, and more. This summer program is great for busy parents, and for those who want their kids to continue learning in an exciting and educational environment. The price for each child to go to camp for one week is $85. Many families, however, cannot afford to send their kids to SKIP, so our goal is to raise $1,300 to help them out. With your donations, we will be able to send 15 kids to a week of this summer program.  How It HelpsBy attending this program, the lives of these children are not only enriched, but it also benefits these families as it allows their parents to work and provide for their families. Parents are also ensured that their children are well taken care of during this program. In addition, the community is benefited by a better educated future generation. By donating, children get the chance to learn and develop in a supporting environment that they would otherwise not have exposure to.  How Else You Can HelpWe understand that not everyone is able to donate financially. For those who would like to help in other ways, we ask that you share our campaign page with family, friends and coworkers in person, or on social media to help spread the word. Further, sharing the YWCA Knoxville Facebook page will help our campaign.

<p><strong>SAT NAM!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting our fundraiser page.  My name is Brianne.  I am a Mother, a Healer, a Kundalini Yoga Teacher, Advocate for Social Justice <em>and</em> I have a VISION for  something very powerful and impactful to serve low income underserved communities in the Los Angeles area. </p>
<h2>With your support we are  launching the MOTHERSHIP:</h2>
<h3>
<strong>SCHOOL BUS TRANSFORMED INTO A SUPERFLY SPIRITUAL URBAN LIGHTHOUSE taken into LOW INCOME UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BRINGING HEALING through yoga,meditation, massage, acupuncture,</strong><strong> gong baths,  life coaching, Real nutrition, Doula care, creative arts, music and movement for deep healing and transformation to reach one's highest potential</strong>...</h3>
<p>We are doing this fundraiser to BUY THE BUS and transform it by painting the shell with a vibrant mural and rennovating the inside to reflect a peaceful beautiful healing space for the work to take place. The bus will be used as a mobile ""clinic"". We will be taking the bus out several times per week offering our free services to families and children in low income underserved communities in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Low Income underserved communities need these services MORE  than anywhere else in this city.  We will not stop until there is access for all.  ""Siri"" tells me there are 15 yoga studios and 15 massage shops all within 1/2 mile of my house.  In that case, we strive to have 15 buses going out daily where it is most needed! No one is left behing in the Aquarian Age.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The MOTHERSHIP is ready to set sail and we need your help.</h2>
<p>We found a bus that is perfect to get us started for only $2,300!!!  The awesome owner Kris could have gotten cash for it that afternoon but he believed in our cause and worked out a deal with us.<strong>  BUT WE NEED TO RAISE THE FUNDS!</strong></p>
<p><strong>$6000</strong> is the fundraising total. The additional contributions will get us up and running.</p>
<p>$300 Smog Check/Tune Up</p>
<p>$300 DMV registration</p>
<p>$100 Oil Change</p>
<p>$1100 1 year auto insurance </p>
<p>$1000 for bus mural and interior renovation (making it superfly and blissed out)</p>
<p>$900  1/2 year of gas</p>
<p>If we go well over our asking <strong>$6000</strong> for our bare bones launch to something like <strong>$21,290,</strong> we will be well on our way to obtain a nonprofit 501(c)(3) status and operating in a much more expansive way. Not only will we be covering all of our bus expenses like gas, maintenance and insurance but we will be able provide more elaborate outreach and develop more relationships with programs that could use our services.  Have monies to pay for incentives, hold community events and have the resources to do a little more of all that we do to serve.</p>
<p><strong>IT'S DEEP YA'LL but I can't write the book here.  Appetizer for ya.</strong></p>
<p>My professional and personal life have always been interconnected because it is my deepest desire to bring healing and tools for transformation to those who would not otherwise have access.  This is who I am and how it has always been....  A burning desire to bridge barriers, advocate for the voiceless and most importantly, guide people into their power, their own sense of self.</p>
<p>  It is not by coincidence that I met my best friend, Tisha Marina, who shares the same birthday with me 2/12.  It is by no coincidence that we both share this burning desire.  Since we met 14 years ago we knew we were bound for profound work in service for those who were underserved and at risk...especially our youth.   Over the past 14 years we have gained professional and life experience that has prepared us for today and prepared us for this mission.  We have met likeminded folks along the way who are part of our tribe to share their gifts and expertise to bring everybody on this ride into the Aquarian age. We do not want to see people left behind in this most incredible time in our history.  As  healers, teachers, social justice advocates, artists and leaders, our goal is to shine the light, teach the techniques so those at risk can have a backpack full of tools to reach their highest potential, moving into the world rather than sitting on the sidelines. The time is now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our work focuses on serving at risk youth and their families.  Our team is filled with experts and teachers able to provide a cradle to college, life sustaining model, keeping a continuance of support through life in a connected family feel community. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE IMPACT of this mission is priceless in that it is life giving and life supporting to folks who would not otherwise receive the experiences like these to transform their lives. We are so grateful for your support in this mission. Thank you.  The time is now.</p>

<h3>Helping to prevent SIDS</h3>
<p>Every since I first learned of SIDS as a young girl, with the hopes of becoming a mother one day myself, I wanted to know why there had not been more done in the fight against SIDS. As I got older I realized that there were people who were doing just that. Furthermore, I realized that didn't preclude me from attempting to make an effort to be a contributor in the quest to prevent SIDS.  With all that is being done, so far, there is still approximately six percent of babies born will lose their lives to SIDS/SUDS.</p>
<p>The Rain/Element Blanket came into existence after my own daughter experienced a hypothermia event. Had I not had the presence of mind to remove her wet clothes and began to dry and massage her, it frightens me to think of what could have happened. There is research confirming that we must seek ""prevention of neonatal hypothermia is essential newborn care.""</p>

Its design is so beautiful, I can't wait for you to hold the book in your hands! I have persisted with this project despite relapsing cancer, six rounds of chemotherapy, and a nasty bout of hepatitis.

<p>Greetings and welcome to my campaign page.  I am a 32-year-old English, Social Studies, and Creative Writing instructor.  I have studied Buddhist meditation and yoga for 12 years.</p>
<p>In my spiritual traditions, it is recommended to complete an extended practice retreat at some point in one’s life.  I’ve aspired to do a long meditation retreat ever since I first began these studies.  Now, I have decided to take the opportunity to do just that.</p>
<p>I plan to enter a 7-month solitary meditation retreat in a cabin in southern Oregon.  I will be living in a simple room with wood heat and a camping stove, located in the mountains near Ashland, Oregon.</p>
<p>Why would I want to do this?</p>
<p>So far, meditation has helped bring greater clarity, kindness, and open-heartedness to my everyday activities.  When I meditate, I am more gentle with myself and others, less judgmental, and more aware of the consequences of my actions. I hope to bring the positive states of mind cultivated in my retreat to the classrooms in which I will teach. </p>
<p>During the seven months, I will be in silence, eating simple meals between sitting and walking meditation periods.  I plan to continue my studies of Buddhist philosophy, Tibetan language, and yoga asana. I will be guided by my first and longest teachers, Lama Pema Clarke and Lama Yeshe Parke of Kagyu Sukha Chöling in Ashland.  </p>
<p>My retreat will cost $10,000. I have saved enough to cover half of the expenses.  I am trying to raise $5,000 more to cover food, water, health insurance, and teacher donations during my 7 months in the cabin. </p>
<p>If you are inspired to make a donation, please know that every sponsorship, large or small, makes a difference. <em>Even just $5 or $10 can be significant when made by many.</em></p>

We spoke to over 350 people of various ages, from all walks of life, ethnicities and cultures and here's what we asked,</p>
<p>""What did your grandmothers and great grandmothers use for their skincare?”</p>
<p>No one replied with, “Oh my grandmother used toxic chemicals, sulfates and dyes!” and not one person said, “My gramma used phthalates, hydroquinone and micro-beads!"" So we decided, we would not use them either!</p>

<p>We’ve searched far &amp; wide for ingredients that are safely ingestible (either edible or drinkable) in their own right. We then combined them in such a way that they work beautifully together with no chemicals! We found them in global pantries and gardens from around the world!</p>
<p>We truly use natural, organic and toxic-free ingredients! For example, our pure organic chardonnay grape seed oil is not only easily digested but also has a 2-year shelf life!</p>
<p>Plus we use ZERO water in our formulas and thus require no synthetic preservatives either!</p>
<p>A few short months ago we came together to build Borbón Skincare a San Francisco-based, Latina-owned premium organic &amp; natural personal care brand. Now we’re creating products made from the world's finest raw organic, natural &amp; wild crafted ingredients inspired by homeopathic traditions and a goal to bring to market products made with our organic &amp; natural formulas so you don't have to worry about what is being absorbed into your blood stream through your skin!</p>

<h3>June 12, 2017 Update</h3>
<p><strong>WE DID IT!</strong> We reached our initial goal of $8,000. Thank you thank you thank you to everyone who contributed. It has been truly powerful to be supported by people in the neighborhood awaiting our opening, by friends and colleagues in our well connected community acupuncture network, and by lots of individuals and families in RI and Mass who simply care deeply about these cities we live in, about health care access, and about economies that make sense. We are feeling so much love and gratitude!</p>
<p><strong>...AND WE KEEP GOING! </strong>Every dollar we raise beyond that will bring us closer to hiring another acupuncturist, extending our clinic hours, and providing more care for our friends and neighbors! We are so excited to match the momentum and enthusiasm of our supporters, and we are committed to providing a healing space that meets the needs (and demand) of our community. We invite you to join us in reaching for our stretch goal of $10,000.</p>
<p>Thank you for being on this journey with us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Korben and I am an acupuncturist, parent, and story-teller living in Providence, Rhode Island with my wife and 8-year-old son. I've been practicing acupuncture for 15 years and community acupuncture for 10 years, and have found it to be my passion and calling to offer affordable health care to my friends, family, and community.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493649377/kerysk7o6r9dijqsocnm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p> <p>I have been gathering the seeds of Kindred Community Acupuncture for a long long time. I started gathering them when I learned as a young person the simple invocation to think globally and act locally. I gathered them as a young adult when acupuncture not only healed several serious and chronic conditions of mine but also made me feel ecstatic and re-connected, and when I was lucky enough to learn the art and science of Chinese Medicine at New England School of Acupuncture.  I gathered them as a practitioner when providing free group acupuncture treatments all over New Orleans after hurricane Katrina, and when starting Philadelphia Community Acupuncture,  which was one of the first and busiest of the new sliding scale clinics to open around the country. Most recently, I’ve been gathering the seeds here in Rhode Island, treating thousands of people per year over the last half decade at Providence Community Acupuncture, which, like Kindred, is a member of the People’s Organization of Community Acupuncture.<br/><br/>I invite you to join our team of people committed to making effective and natural medicine widely accessible as we plant and nourish and grow Kindred Community Acupuncture into a well established, and vitally important resource for Pawtucket and the Providence neighborhoods of Hope and Mount Hope and North Providence; for Central Falls, Lincoln and other communities along the Blackstone River; for Attleboro and other areas in southern Massachusetts. These neighborhoods comprise some of the most densely populated areas in New England, as well as the communities least served by the profoundly effective natural medicine of acupuncture. Support our launch campaign to make affordable community health care to thousands of people in the area.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493738208/pq96w0pkokcs813jv1ia.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>                                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493738243/hydfa2lu5k6qzh0fvps5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are so excited to open the doors of our clinic in July with a growing community of supporters around us and in the chairs! In order to start with enough financial capital, we need to raise $8,000 in crowdsource support. This amount will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Front Office Set-up: A desk, new computer and printer</li>
<li>Communications Equipment: phone and internet connection</li>
<li>3 Months Worth of Acupuncture Supplies: single use acupuncture needles, blankets, pillows, first aid materials</li>
<li>3 Months Rent: for our beautiful new space in the Mills Building at 545 Pawtucket Ave</li>
<li>Marketing Materials &amp; Merch: fliers, business cards, t-shirts, and stickers*</li>
</ul>
<p>*We are really excited to offer some of our beautifully-designed merch as perks for our contributors! See the perks at the right to decide how much you’d like to give ---&gt;<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493738402/w7yg2bicy9p9wbllmcfl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Blessed with what will be a beautiful and relaxing sanctuary of a clinic space, we hope that by our summer opening it can serve as a giant shade tree for neighbors and fellow travellers at our intersection between cities. By helping cover the costs for those first three growing months,  you’ll help assure that Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts can harvest the fruits of a completely flourishing clinic and community space by autumn, usually the busiest time for community acupuncture. At that point, we’ll throw a Kindred Harvest Party to thank contributors and patients and continue the process of creating community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We've Got So Far</h3>
<p>We are so excited with all the momentum we’ve generated so far! As of now, we have an amazing launch team taking on different aspects of our opening: the treatment, financing, administration, and marketing</p>
<p>We are also very excited to already have a base of over 200 patients and supporters via our existing networks, facebook page, and email list!</p>
<p>We have a beautiful clinic space in the Mills at 545 Pawtucket Ave. The space includes beautiful hardwood floors, enormous windows for natural light, and an amazing community of local businesses, artists, and activists also housed in the same building.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help, Kindred will open this summer to provide quality acupuncture treatment at a low-cost sliding scale fee ($15 - $45) to (you and) thousands of our neighbors who have  been yet able to access and afford  this vital natural medicine. We will be joining the network of hundreds of successful and boming community acupuncture clinics around the country as part of the People's Organization of Community Acupuncture (POCA).</p>
<p>Most people don’t want to pay for an individualized and quasi mystical “experience”, or for a specialist in a lab coat-- or have the money for that! Kindred will focus on our maximizing our patients' treatment results, respecting patients as an essential part of a healing community, creating a comfortable and casual atmosphere for healing, and increasing patients' ability to get frequent and regular treatments.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In offering community acupuncture at affordable rates, our clinic will only succeed if we are able to build a strong base of support and patients invested in the clinic and also experiencing the benefits of regular acupuncture treatments. We know that success in building a base in the first 6 months of opening Kindred will be essential in allowing the clinic to sustain itself and continue to offer vital health services to the region. Through our existing networks as well as our reputation for providing relief and healing through acupuncture, we are confident that our clinic has the critical mass it needs to be successful. We see this crowdsource fundraiser campaign as a visible manifestation of that community of support in creating and sustaining this essential space of healing, treatment, and relief.</p>

<h3>Why Community Acupuncture?</h3>
<p>In the U.S, outside of some East Asian communities, acupuncture has become known as a boutique treatment, performed on tables in individual cubicles. This model has less to do with any traditional understanding of the best way to receive acupuncture and more to do with our cultural training as individualized consumers in a psycho-medicalized market. In our clinic we use recliners grouped in a quiet and soothing space. Treating patients in a community setting has many benefits: it’s easy for friends and family members to come in for treatment together; many patients find it comforting. We also believe that a collective energy field becomes established which makes individual treatments more powerful. Many people fall asleep, and wake feeling refreshed, energized, clear-headed.</p>
<p>Community acupuncture is about improving results by expanding access. It’s about the patient being able to get more, and therefore more effective, treatments by virtue of our sliding scale. If the practitioner knows she or he might see you 6 times instead of once, the treatments can be simple, relaxing, geared towards long range goals as well as immediate relief.</p>
<p>The other kind of access which is important to us is that of each patient’s connection to community and to collective healing. Much of our modern illness and injury is related to isolation and oppression, and the antidote to this is not more separation but more connection, more caring and more community.  </p>
<p>Here’s what you can rely on from us. Experienced and dedicated and licensed practitioners and a clinic open the kind of varied hours including evenings and weekends that most of us need given our work and family schedules. Expert and friendly front desk staff. Clear information about our policies, fees, and what to expect and not to expect as a patient. A calm and clean sanctuary with a slow buzz of energy and where every effort has been made to ensure the comfort and safety of every patient. A gathering space for community groups and a small library of information about local health and justice issues. Local art. The pioneering of a program offering local high school students the opportunity to observe and study community acupuncture in action.</p>

It has been truly powerful to be supported by people in the neighborhood awaiting our opening, by friends and colleagues in our well connected community acupuncture network, and by lots of individuals and families in RI and Mass who simply care deeply about these cities we live in, about health care access, and about economies that make sense. We are feeling so much love and gratitude!
...AND WE KEEP GOING! Every dollar we raise beyond that will bring us closer to hiring another acupuncturist, extending our clinic hours, and providing more care for our friends and neighbors! We are so excited to match the momentum and enthusiasm of our supporters, and we are committed to providing a healing space that meets the needs (and demand) of our community. We invite you to join us in reaching for our stretch goal of $10,000.
Thank you for being on this journey with us.
 
Short Summary
My name is Korben and I am an acupuncturist, parent, and story-teller living in Providence, Rhode Island with my wife and 8-year-old son. I've been practicing acupuncture for 15 years and community acupuncture for 10 years, and have found it to be my passion and calling to offer affordable health care to my friends, family, and community.
  I have been gathering the seeds of Kindred Community Acupuncture for a long long time. I started gathering them when I learned as a young person the simple invocation to think globally and act locally. I gathered them as a young adult when acupuncture not only healed several serious and chronic conditions of mine but also made me feel ecstatic and re-connected, and when I was lucky enough to learn the art and science of Chinese Medicine at New England School of Acupuncture.  I gathered them as a practitioner when providing free group acupuncture treatments all over New Orleans after hurricane Katrina, and when starting Philadelphia Community Acupuncture,  which was one of the first and busiest of the new sliding scale clinics to open around the country. Most recently, I’ve been gathering the seeds here in Rhode Island, treating thousands of people per year over the last half decade at Providence Community Acupuncture, which, like Kindred, is a member of the People’s Organization of Community Acupuncture.I invite you to join our team of people committed to making effective and natural medicine widely accessible as we plant and nourish and grow Kindred Community Acupuncture into a well established, and vitally important resource for Pawtucket and the Providence neighborhoods of Hope and Mount Hope and North Providence; for Central Falls, Lincoln and other communities along the Blackstone River; for Attleboro and other areas in southern Massachusetts. These neighborhoods comprise some of the most densely populated areas in New England, as well as the communities least served by the profoundly effective natural medicine of acupuncture. Support our launch campaign to make affordable community health care to thousands of people in the area.

What We Need & What You Get
We are so excited to open the doors of our clinic in July with a growing community of supporters around us and in the chairs! In order to start with enough financial capital, we need to raise $8,000 in crowdsource support. This amount will go towards:

Front Office Set-up: A desk, new computer and printer
Communications Equipment: phone and internet connection
3 Months Worth of Acupuncture Supplies: single use acupuncture needles, blankets, pillows, first aid materials
3 Months Rent: for our beautiful new space in the Mills Building at 545 Pawtucket Ave
Marketing Materials & Merch: fliers, business cards, t-shirts, and stickers*

*We are really excited to offer some of our beautifully-designed merch as perks for our contributors! See the perks at the right to decide how much you’d like to give --->
Blessed with what will be a beautiful and relaxing sanctuary of a clinic space, we hope that by our summer opening it can serve as a giant shade tree for neighbors and fellow travellers at our intersection between cities. By helping cover the costs for those first three growing months,  you’ll help assure that Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts can harvest the fruits of a completely flourishing clinic and community space by autumn, usually the busiest time for community acupuncture. At that point, we’ll throw a Kindred Harvest Party to thank contributors and patients and continue the process of creating community.

What We've Got So Far
We are so excited with all the momentum we’ve generated so far! As of now, we have an amazing launch team taking on different aspects of our opening: the treatment, financing, administration, and marketing
We are also very excited to already have a base of over 200 patients and supporters via our existing networks, facebook page, and email list!
We have a beautiful clinic space in the Mills at 545 Pawtucket Ave. The space includes beautiful hardwood floors, enormous windows for natural light, and an amazing community of local businesses, artists, and activists also housed in the same building.
The Impact
With your help, Kindred will open this summer to provide quality acupuncture treatment at a low-cost sliding scale fee ($15 - $45) to (you and) thousands of our neighbors who have  been yet able to access and afford  this vital natural medicine. We will be joining the network of hundreds of successful and boming community acupuncture clinics around the country as part of the People's Organization of Community Acupuncture (POCA).
Most people don’t want to pay for an individualized and quasi mystical “experience”, or for a specialist in a lab coat-- or have the money for that! Kindred will focus on our maximizing our patients' treatment results, respecting patients as an essential part of a healing community, creating a comfortable and casual atmosphere for healing, and increasing patients' ability to get frequent and regular treatments.

Risks & Challenges
In offering community acupuncture at affordable rates, our clinic will only succeed if we are able to build a strong base of support and patients invested in the clinic and also experiencing the benefits of regular acupuncture treatments. We know that success in building a base in the first 6 months of opening Kindred will be essential in allowing the clinic to sustain itself and continue to offer vital health services to the region. Through our existing networks as well as our reputation for providing relief and healing through acupuncture, we are confident that our clinic has the critical mass it needs to be successful. We see this crowdsource fundraiser campaign as a visible manifestation of that community of support in creating and sustaining this essential space of healing, treatment, and relief.

Why Community Acupuncture?
In the U.S, outside of some East Asian communities, acupuncture has become known as a boutique treatment, performed on tables in individual cubicles. This model has less to do with any traditional understanding of the best way to receive acupuncture and more to do with our cultural training as individualized consumers in a psycho-medicalized market. In our clinic we use recliners grouped in a quiet and soothing space. Treating patients in a community setting has many benefits: it’s easy for friends and family members to come in for treatment together; many patients find it comforting. We also believe that a collective energy field becomes established which makes individual treatments more powerful. Many people fall asleep, and wake feeling refreshed, energized, clear-headed.
Community acupuncture is about improving results by expanding access. It’s about the patient being able to get more, and therefore more effective, treatments by virtue of our sliding scale. If the practitioner knows she or he might see you 6 times instead of once, the treatments can be simple, relaxing, geared towards long range goals as well as immediate relief.
The other kind of access which is important to us is that of each patient’s connection to community and to collective healing. Much of our modern illness and injury is related to isolation and oppression, and the antidote to this is not more separation but more connection, more caring and more community.  
Here’s what you can rely on from us. Experienced and dedicated and licensed practitioners and a clinic open the kind of varied hours including evenings and weekends that most of us need given our work and family schedules. Expert and friendly front desk staff. Clear information about our policies, fees, and what to expect and not to expect as a patient. A calm and clean sanctuary with a slow buzz of energy and where every effort has been made to ensure the comfort and safety of every patient. A gathering space for community groups and a small library of information about local health and justice issues. Local art. The pioneering of a program offering local high school students the opportunity to observe and study community acupuncture in action.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Here are the </span>details<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> to create the Himalayan Salt Healing Retreat Center...</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Himalayan Salt = $6,000</p>
<p>Currently I have a small amount of Himalayan salt in stock to run my business but in order to purchase enough to do the center, including salt bricks for salt room, I would need this amount to purchase from my investor who keeps the stock in Chiang Rai, Thailand.  The salt is very expensive when you consider transport cost, taxes, customs, broker, fees and again transport in Thailand.  Most of the cost is in transport.  We would need roughly 3,000 salt bricks for walls and floor.  The floor will be made by pressing each brick into clay earth with natural mortar grouting between.  The wall will be made by pressing each brick into clay plaster on adobe brick walls. Needless to say this structure will be a very grounding experience.</p>
<p>Each brick is 8 inch long by 2 inch thick.  Each brick costs $1.50 after customs, taxes &amp; transport.  The remaining balance would be used for purchasing salt stock for the retreat center for the purpose of consumption &amp; cleansing.  All of our salt is edible grade!</p>
<p>Here is an image of the salt brick..</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/372931/files/20140216011203-images__1_.jpg?1392541923"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>Salt Room Dome = $5,500</p>
<p>This includes labor, earth, construction, materials as well as dehumidifier, salt air ionizer, all electrical and surround sound speaker system with wooden door.</p>
<p>Octagonal Meeting Space = $3,000</p>
<p>This is to purchase all wood posts and roofing wood (wood is expensive these days in Thailand) and to pour beams under ground around perimeter.  This would also include surround sound system as well as mic etc.</p>
<p>Solar System for pool (including jacuzzi system) = $4,500</p>
<p>This includes purchasing all materials including black tubing for solar heating water, platform to put piping on and pump for jacuzzi jets.  Additionally the pool would need to be saturated with Himalayan salt and purification systems put in such as ozone.  The pool also needs cover for rainy season and needs to be pH checked for acidifying or alkalizing.  </p>
<p>Earth Bungalow = $9,500</p>
<p>We want to make our accommodating first class which means building in a solid and long lasting way.  Also we want to make the bungalow sealed from bugs and so that it is warm in winter and cool in summer.  This is possible when construction is fully sealed. This cost includes solid reinforced concrete beams with proper foundation.  All water piping, electrical as well as top class flooring such as granite tile and teak parquet wood floors and tiled kitchen &amp; bathroom.  Everything will be sealed with lacquer. Additionally the rooftop will be a high cost due to the need to lay concrete planks down and then pouring a floor then to be tiled.  Ceramic roofing tiles will fan out from the edge of the flat roof to protect the earth walls.  I have experience building in Thailand and know how to save cost, direct workers in Thai and how to build the best for this climate. The end result will be a very comfortable bungalow and stunning construction with beautiful views and quiet relaxing energy for patrons to enjoy!</p>
<p>If this project is funded then I expect it to be finished by Summer 2015.  If I am unable to meet the goal then I will still build the salt room &amp; dance/yoga meeting space as priority and currently have a guest room that I can make work for accommodation in the meantime. The bungalow will be needed in the future though so hopefully we can fully fund!</p>
<p>By helping me fund this you are enabling this planet and it's people to start to heal one person at a time.  I really trust these techniques for bringing people to wholeness and health and feel strongly that it is my life purpose to bring this to the world.  I have a great reputation with the community in Pai and am known for my honesty and follow throughness.  I am a strongly motivated person with great perserverence and I simply will not stop until this project is brought into full fruition!  I am confident that it will be!</p>

<h3>Help us blanket Charleston with Naloxone (aka Narcan) </h3>
<p><u>Our county is still in a crisis</u>. We lose a family member every two and a half days - mostly to opioid overdoses. There is an easy-to-use antidote for these overdoses, a nasal spray version of Naloxone called Narcan. By making this medicine widely accessible, we can save more lives. <br/><br/>For the past 6 months, a new community group SOAR (Solutions Oriented Addiction Response) has trained and helped equip over 50 local businesses, churches, and nonprofits with Narcan. Most all businesses put up a sticker that says ""We Carry Naloxone"", which challenges the stigma around addiction while alerting bystanders that the antidote is nearby. <br/><br/>We wouldn't have been able to do this work to date without major help - including working with Dr. Lindsay Acree, Dr. Christine Teague, and Kathy Kay. <br/><br/><strong>Below are some of your favorite Lifesavers: </strong></p>

<p><br/>The Canstruction Toronto event challenge is to build a structure made entirely of (canned) food, all of which is then donated to the Daily Bread Food Bank. All of the money you donate will go towards buying the food required to build our top-secret structure. We need to raise well over $6000 dollars to make our entry another huge success, and maximize the quality and quantity of the canned food which will be donated to the Daily Bread Food Bank.</p>
<p>Our past entries were huge successes - check out the """"MiCANaak"" turtle pictured here, or the previous year's ""BeaCAN Of Hope"" Lighthouse! Though our entries won accolades for design and structural stability, the real prize is having raised over $3,800 in food donations last year alone. We love this event because it creates an opportunity for us to apply creativity, teamwork, and analytical problem solving in a fun event that benefits our community. We need your help to finance this year's entry. Your contribution will help provide relief to an ever-increasing hungry population in Toronto. We truly appreciate any support that you can offer to our campaign, whether it be a monetary donation, or making some noise about this event and passing along the info to your own contacts.</p>

Our past entries were huge successes - check out the """"MiCANaak"" turtle pictured here, or the previous year's ""BeaCAN Of Hope"" Lighthouse! Though our entries won accolades for design and structural stability, the real prize is having raised over $3,800 in food donations last year alone. We love this event because it creates an opportunity for us to apply creativity, teamwork, and analytical problem solving in a fun event that benefits our community. We need your help to finance this year's entry. Your contribution will help provide relief to an ever-increasing hungry population in Toronto. We truly appreciate any support that you can offer to our campaign, whether it be a monetary donation, or making some noise about this event and passing along the info to your own contacts.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For 20 years, Dave White has single-handedly run The Downtown Boxing Club. Ever the pioneer, the club has been housed in many up and coming areas, from Chinatown to Blagden Alley, to Union Market, all before they were desirable.

<p><strong>Our Story </strong></p>
<p>There are very few of us that have not been touched directly or indirectly by someone who has suffered from the disease of addiction in its many forms – whether it is from drugs and alcohol, gambling, or shopping.  Those of us who have experienced firsthand the devastating effects on our families and communities know and understand how critical it is for our loved ones to have a haven where women and men feel safe, nurtured and supported and where the process of healing and recovery can begin. </p>
<p>In order to successfully provide treatment for substance abuse clients, Verdun House and Marina House, projects of The Substance Abuse Foundation Inc., need funding to effectively manage their operations and provide treatment for clients and their families who are in need.</p>
<p>Energy and utility costs are a significant contributor to our operation expenses.  Research has shown that the use of solar energy can greatly offset costs associated with electricity. Given our location in Barbados, this is the most appropriate energy type to harness because of the record days of sunlight that the island enjoys.</p>
<p>We have therefore started a campaign to raise USD30,000 to finalize the purchase and installation of solar panels at Verdun House, our male residential drug treatment facility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Rooftop Project: Quick Facts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Estimated size of solar PV panels that can be accommodated on existing buildings – 502</li>
<li>Use of current building's roof space and so generate as much electricity as possible without exceeding BLPC capacity limits (based on the main breakersize)</li>
<li>Projected total capacity of all PV systems – 159.6 kW</li>
<li>Anticipated total amount of electricity to be generated per annum – 246.594 kWh</li>
<li>Annual revenue stream projected to be approximately BBD$102,583</li>
<li>The overall project involves the purchase of 502 panels at an estimated cost of BBD$1,000 per panel</li>
<li>Payback based on preferred vendor – 5.2 years</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cost of Project</strong></p>
<p>The purchase and installation of the solar PV panels will account for a significant portion of this project. It is scheduled to completed by December 2017, with a total estimated cost of approximately BBD502,000, based on pricing of BBD1,000 per panel. USD30,000 (BBD60,000) raised from this campaign will ensure we can complete the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact of Renewable Energy Project</strong></p>
<p>SAFI already demonstrates best practice standards in support of environmental programmes. This project builds on this track record of leadership and innovation, and helps contribute to Barbados’ national target of being fossil-free by 2030. This investment will help us reduce our operating expenditure, enhance our ongoing “greening” initiative, fund critical programmes, and provide even more work opportunities for our clients.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Solar PV Rooftop Project will help us make a difference in several ways:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Doing our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protecting our country, region and the world for future generations</li>
<li>Actively participating in contributing to national development goals – one of which is transition to affordable and clean energy</li>
<li>Reducing the expensive cost of electricity bills to make available more funds to support critical rehabilitation, therapeutic and family programmes, as well as education and skills training</li>
<li>Earning revenue to improve our ability to treat more individuals and their families</li>
<li>Providing clients with the opportunity to participate in skills training in the emerging sector of renewable energy. This increases their chances of gaining employment and providing for their families.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Ask</strong></p>
<p>Every gift counts. Your contribution and investment will go a long way in further promoting substance abuse treatment and changing the lives of men, women and their families. Please help us make our communities, our country and our world healthier and safer for all.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Josh Bochniak. I have been a rock climber, program coordinator and outdoor and experiential educator for nearly 20 years. I have worked with thousands of individuals and groups in that time, and I have seen that challenging, non-competitive and experiential activities like rock climbing can bring people together and help people develop in a number of ways. It teaches lifelong fitness, self-confidence, personal resilience through skill mastery, and problem solving in a non-traditional fitness setting. Scrapyard Climbing Collective will provide a space to do this in a supportive and engaging social environment. Your contributions will help make this dream a reality. Your generosity will provide a place for kids to build confidence and get away from screens.

<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>I have funding through personal finances to get this all started, but not enough to fully expand the facility. The climbing gym as it is now does not meet the needs of the community we envision.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As highlighted above, Scrapyard Climbing Collective will be a place that fosters personal and group development in a variety of ways. And in a world where many of our social interactions are dominated by technology, rock climbing also provides an activity that invites participants to put down screens and phones and be present. Climbing teaches responsibility for direct attention to others to keep others safe. In addition to creating a welcoming community, we seek to provide a place that offers this direct connection. And for the many children and families in Holland who cannot afford to try climbing, we are seeking ways to provide access without a high price tag. We think climbing and outdoor recreation should not only be for those who can afford it. If you are in Holland, then this place will be yours if you choose to join us. If you are far away, then your contribution is valuable as a mark of your support of this vision.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have an exciting and challenging road ahead of us. Implementing programs and building membership will be a daily effort. Our greatest risk is overestimating the market capacity for this place.

</div></div>","Summary
Hi, I'm Josh Bochniak. I have been a rock climber, program coordinator and outdoor and experiential educator for nearly 20 years. I have worked with thousands of individuals and groups in that time, and I have seen that challenging, non-competitive and experiential activities like rock climbing can bring people together and help people develop in a number of ways. It teaches lifelong fitness, self-confidence, personal resilience through skill mastery, and problem solving in a non-traditional fitness setting. Scrapyard Climbing Collective will provide a space to do this in a supportive and engaging social environment. Your contributions will help make this dream a reality. Your generosity will provide a place for kids to build confidence and get away from screens. You will enable adults to find connection in an engaging new way. And you will support the creation of a diverse community of individuals, bonded by the reality that shared experience brings us together.

The Details
I have funding through personal finances to get this all started, but not enough to fully expand the facility. The climbing gym as it is now does not meet the needs of the community we envision. We need taller, roped climbing walls to engage a wider variety of people, walls that are more beginner friendly and provide better teaching opportunities. We are asking for $30,000 to expand what the space offers.
That funding will be used for:

Building new climbing walls
Installing top ropes and auto belay stations
Installing new climbing safety flooring
Buying more climbing holds to fill the new walls
Buying furniture to create a comfortable seating area for all visitors

In return, you can choose from a variety of perks. Beyond the satisfaction of helping make this dream come true, we have memberships, apparel, and experiences at the ready. You’ll also have the option of giving these opportunities to someone else through sponsorship.


The Impact
As highlighted above, Scrapyard Climbing Collective will be a place that fosters personal and group development in a variety of ways. And in a world where many of our social interactions are dominated by technology, rock climbing also provides an activity that invites participants to put down screens and phones and be present. Climbing teaches responsibility for direct attention to others to keep others safe. In addition to creating a welcoming community, we seek to provide a place that offers this direct connection. And for the many children and families in Holland who cannot afford to try climbing, we are seeking ways to provide access without a high price tag. We think climbing and outdoor recreation should not only be for those who can afford it. If you are in Holland, then this place will be yours if you choose to join us. If you are far away, then your contribution is valuable as a mark of your support of this vision.


Risks & Challenges
We have an exciting and challenging road ahead of us. Implementing programs and building membership will be a daily effort. Our greatest risk is overestimating the market capacity for this place. As the only facility within 40 minutes, we believe the Holland community will support a gym our size. The main challenge will be getting the word out about it and drawing people in. 
I may be the owner, but I am fortunate to have a group of passionate individuals who are invested in the success of this vision. Together, our team has experience in program coordination, community engagement, marketing and communication, and a variety of other skills to help us make this endeavor a success. With your support, we will be able to bring this vision to the Holland community.

<p><strong>Dating Yourself: Finding Self Love Before True Love</strong> is about finding self-happiness before entering a serious relationship. The biggest investment that we will make in our lives is the partner with whom we choose to share our lives. By further discovering ourselves and what makes us truly happy, we can then have an easier chance of finding a person that makes us happy.<br/><br/>My name is <strong>Matthew Henry</strong> and I am the <strong>author</strong> of Dating Yourself: Finding Self-Love Before True Love. I wrote this book because after I wrote my first book on Bipartisanship in American Politics, I realized that communication was not a political problem but a people problem. After many discussions with close friends, I noticed a pattern in how a lack of communication was also impacting the way we date. I want to show people that they can date people that are healthy for them but first they need to look at their own happiness first.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover self-love will make you a better person, friend, and romantic partner in the long run. Sometimes our worst enemy can be ourselves. We need to get rid of negative talk and re-program our minds to think more positive. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for self-love in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you continue building yourself while also finding the right people to surround yourself with.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about</p>
<p>*Understanding your emotional infrastructure, further understanding your needs in a partner by looking at yourself</p>
<p>*Managing those moments of depression through empathy and self-discipline</p>
<p>*Finding out what you truly want in a partner, and what red flags to avoid in the future.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are a fan of authors like Shawn Anchor, author of the Happiness Advantage, and Daniel Pink, author of Drive.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The Book - Dating Yourself: Finding Self-Love Before True Love</p>
<br/><strong>The book is written in Four Parts:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Part I </strong>is titled <strong>How We Got Here</strong>. This portion takes a look back at Dating before the age of social media and dating apps. We will briefly look at the history of dating and the effectiveness of Dating apps.<br/><br/><strong>Part II</strong> is titled <strong>Principles of Self-Lovers</strong>. This portion is about introducing different concepts that can help empower you. You will soon discover that dating is not so much about finding the right person, instead it’s more so about finding the type of person you want to become.<br/><br/><strong>Part III</strong> is titled <strong>How to Date Yourself</strong>. This portion of the book is about managing your own happiness by avoiding the pitfalls of depression and anxiety. Looking after yourself first is crucial before entering the dating world. Not only are you investing your time in another person, but they are also taking time to invest in you!<br/><br/><strong>Part IV</strong> is titled <strong>How to Date Others</strong>. This last portion of the book takes a look at real-life relationships and looking at what people have learned about themselves through their relationships. The most highlighted chapter in this section is “How to Avoid Red Flags.” No matter their age or education level, every person that I’ve interviewed mentioned the importance of finding those red flags in the beginning and the consequences of not doing so.<p>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</p>
<br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020</p>
<p>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</p>
<p>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</p>
<p>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</p>
<p>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer</p>
<br/>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book NOW:<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</p>
<p>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</p>
<p>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</p>
<p>Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</p>
<p>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</p>
<p>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book</p>
<p>And more...</p>
<p>About the <strong>Author</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew Henry is a TEDx speaker, published author, and a recent graduate of Georgetown University. Meeting and connecting with people has become a passion for Matthew. Last year he wrote his first book titled Working Together: Why We Need Bipartisanship in American Politics.</strong><br/><br/><strong>He learned that the problem in politics was not political but more so about understanding people. This need to further understand the human connection inspired Matthew to write a book about dating in the digital age. He is by no means an expert in dating and probably needs advice of his own, but Matthew is simply curious on ways in which men and women can better connect. The thesis for his book is that you will be much happier in a long-term relationship if you focus on your own self-happiness first.</strong><br/><br/>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p> Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:<p>Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #loveyourself hashtag tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.</p>

<h3>I live in NYC and lost my job of 30 years one morning in April with no warning. Two weeks later my dog Josie went into heart failure and I almost lost her.

When I went to borrow from my 401K I found out you can only take a loan out when you are working! She is my baby and an incredibly special soul.

Nourishing Acres will be the first medicinal herb farm in the upper Midwest with an organic certification in mind for our long term goal. This small farm surrounded by woods with beautiful Linden trees overlooking the property, significant because Linden trees are a ""symbol of love, prosperity, friendship, peace, justice, altruism, and good luck. They're also popular in traditions due to the positive aspects IE; healing trees, protective trees, trees that are keeping away the diseases"". This space will become a permaculture style farm for medicinal herbs. While the few medicinal herb farms in the country tend to use traditional row crops as harvest is generally much easier, we have a different idea.<br/><br/>This farm is a community space to get back to our roots and connect to herbalism and tradition. We aren't aiming for widescale production and distribution. We will be growing to serve our community and bring life back to the soil, the air, the water. Keeping the biodiversity up, focusing on medicinal natives, and of course always giving back to the land. This farms destiny is to bridge the gap between traditional and modern approaches to wellness, both in children and adults. Even just from working with dried herbs to fresh as the season allows. To get folks involved in herbalism and seeing where and how these wonderful plants grow. You can tell a lot about a plants medicinal properties by how it grows. Does it love wet soil? Is it mucilaginous? Getting the communities hands in the soil and creating something bigger than ourselves. To have hands on workshops about use and preparations after harvesting the herbs ourselves. Seeing, smelling, tasting, feeling.  To sit under the stars in the summer, in front of a fire with music and fireflies dancing around us. To take community plant identification walks and open the world of plant ID and foraging. A whole language just waiting to be learned and explored in this community.<br/><br/><br/>Herbs aside, we plan to have a community space and stage in the back left corner for music (music is medicine!) As well as a fire pit. Next to that will be the waldorf playspace for children. A space for open ended imaginative play in nature. Fully equipped with an organic UPick tea garden. On the other side of the property tucked in the back right corner we hope will be a Yurt for the outdoor school to utilize. Next to that, the animals. We have goats, chickens and bunnies (and eventually 2 Llamas :) )!  In between all of it, throughout several acres will be a magical permaculture herb farm with wandering paths full of magic, including a small trail into the woods for a quick step into another world. On the left side of the property is a small creek. We plan to grow an elderberry forest on the other side of this creek, as there are several established plants in place as it is. They seem to love the conditions over there. This is all of course after we bring life back to this soil. While it hasn't been farmed for at least 5 years if not more, it certainly needs some love. We will be working with nature and not against it to bring locally grown healing plants to our community. We plan to use permaculture methods to reduce pests and disease as well. We already have quite a few bats, and in the area that the bats reside, the mosquito population is significantly less! We have a couple bat houses to put up in other areas of the property too. The barn will be utilized as a drying space for herbs as well as a space for workshops and we hope to find the perfect person to do a mural on the back over looking the farm.<br/><br/><br/>Our plans are on going, and huge and exciting! For this community space to come to life we need help. This is a HUGE undertaking. I know it will be worth it, but I hope you can join us on this journey! We are setting up this crowd funding site to help with some of the bigger overwhelming bits. The yurt for the full time outdoor school and potential workshops, and some equipment we are desperately needing (a tractor). Things are coming together and we are so excited!! Our donation goal will be set out through September. We will have a celebratory event upon the crowd funding closing and have you all out to the farm to check out the progress and to see the site! We hope to have a band playing and some food trucks. While, we obviously won't have anything planted yet, you will be able to really see how the land is healing and how the community is coming together! </p></div></div>","Nourishing AcresWe are bringing life back to this land.

<h1>Greetings!</h1>
<p>My name is Yudo Robert Yorga and I am the founder of a zen community in Minneapolis, Minn.</p>
<p>The zen community is called Orchids and Bones. I chose orchids and bones because they epitomize the qualities we are trying to manifest in ourselves, grace, beauty, gentleness, strength, and structure. </p>
<p>I began formal practice in 2007 with my first sesshin or week-long retreat. In 2009 I met my zen teacher, <a href=""http://www.mondozen.org/people/abbot-jun-po-denis-kelly"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Junpo Denis Kelly</a> and I immediately saw the value of his teachings. Emphasizing the importance of awareness training so that we truly understand the information buried beneath the surface noise of our <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOaAPx5kPOU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">emotions</a>. We are able to transform ourselves and our relationships by meeting each moment with increased clarity and understanding. </p>
<p>I have been working with these teachings for about four years now and want to bring this to my hometown of Minneapolis. I established Orchids &amp; Bones in February of 2013; we meet weekly for meditation and discussion. A number of people have suggested a more intensive period of meditation and this brings us to the zazenkai or day-long meditation retreat.</p>
<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<p>To host a day-long retreat I need about five more sets of cushions or zafus/zabutons and an inkin or bell to begin and end zazen or a meditation period. I have bought a few sets of cushions already and I would like to get more as our community is getting larger. </p>
<p>So this is what I will spend the funds on....</p>

</div></div>","10 Natural was founded in 2010 in Antigua, Guatemala by Ben Richard, who has lived and worked in Central America as a Peace Corps volunteer, teacher and naturalist for 15 years. He continuously works with various non-profit organizations and Macadamia farmers offering technical assistance to isolated  Maya communities planting tens of thousands of trees  to restore the natural environment, develop a sustainable food source, and create a future source of income to enhance their economic base.From these experiences he learned how amazingly beneficial Macadamia Oil is for our skin and hair.  He was inspired to create 10 Natural Pure Macadamia Cosmetic Products.
​​Geriatric Casa Maria opened on September 1, 1995, on Broad Street in La Antigua, Guatemala. Initially it was established as a company, but they encountered the harsh reality that most people who need services like those offered by Geriatric Casa Maria, are poor people and often do not have family to care for them.  That revealed the great demand in Antigua, Guatemala and across the country for homes with special care for elderly people, especially for people without financial resources.  
Since 1998 Asociacion Geriatrica Casa Maria has operated as a private, nonprofit civil association, comprehensive development, and apolitical. Moving forward for this home has been a constant strugle.  Thinking about the welfare of all people living here and all the people who still need this service.
 
 10 Natural conducted a study on the benefits of Macadamia oil, treating skin problems in older adults at Geriatric Casa Maria with excellent results after just one week of use.
Because they are older adults who were abandoned and have no way to survive we realized the great need they have.
Thus the idea of this campaign!
With your help we hope to provide Skin Cream, Macadamia Oil and Lip Balm to all the elderly at Geriatric Casa Maria  for one year.
Macadamia is native to the East Coast rainforests  of Australia.  These sweet, crunchy nuts grow in abundance in tropical and subtropical Australia, Hawaii, Central America, Brazil and South African regions .
 

 
 Benefits of Macadamia Cream and Oil

Macadamia Oil has been shown to slow the signs of aging.  It has also been used to improve the appearance of scars, sunburn and other minor skin irritations.

It restores Palmitoleic Acid (Omega 7) levels in our skin which decline with age, contributing to the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and weathered skin.  It is also an active anti-microbial found naturally in youthful skin.

The Linoleic Acid (Omega 6) in Macadamia Oil helps to restore the skin’s barrier function and reduce water loss.
These fatty acids also have anti-inflammatory properties.
It’s high in monounsaturated fatty acids, including Oleic Acid (Omega 9) that moisturize, regenerate and soften the skin.
Macadamia Oil absorbs immediately without feeling greasy.

This course will be priced at $150 for the course in the future. If I'm unable to raise the full needed funds for the course I'll do a less expensive but less conveniently timed online course (same hours as the other course but over 10 weeks instead of 1), which means I'll be unable to begin teaching courses till May of 2014. The course I'm hoping to book will allow me to begin teaching on Feb 2nd and has the added bonus of being affiliated with Oxford University. I’m not the only one experiencing an incredible remission – check out New York Times reporter Donna Jackson Nakazawa's own experiences in coming back from paralysis.Thank you!------------REFERENCES----------[1] http://www.news.wisc.edu/22370, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18805511[2] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21605904[3] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18805511[4] http://thelowhistaminechef.com/yogic-pranayama-breathing-lowers-histamine/",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>For 21 years, the Order of the Red Grail has served the Pagan
community with open Full Moon Circles and Sabbats, rites of passage, spiritual
counseling, education and prison ministry that has spanned 17 years. Public service
includes donations to area food bank, domestic abuse shelters, military soldier
support, and clergy presence at hospitals and police departments with the
belief that positive examples and actions by local pagans will makes a strong
statement to mainstream faith groups that while practices and beliefs are
different, service to humanity is universal.  </p>
<p>This work is established and stable. However, progressing into
the 21<sup>st</sup> century requires taking the next step – bridging differences
by strengthening spiritual community among life-affirming pagans and non-pagans
alike. </p>
<p>To this end, The Grail intends to create the <i>Red
Grail Spiritual Retreat Center </i>where
spiritual community reigns over religious differences. The Grail intends to obtain
5 or more acres of woodland to define this sacred space. The Center will
initially include a barn that will be available for rituals, classes, feasts, weddings,
and other community functions. As the property is developed, there will be space
for children and families to learn about nature and the cycles of life, a stone
labyrinth, community garden, wild preserve, and additional features as space
and funds allow. </p>
<p>The main goal is to provide a stable setting where many can
safely worship, celebrate and find peace. We invite you to join in this
journey. You can help by:</p>

initially include a barn that will be available for rituals, classes, feasts, weddings,
and other community functions. As the property is developed, there will be space
for children and families to learn about nature and the cycles of life, a stone
labyrinth, community garden, wild preserve, and additional features as space
and funds allow. 
The main goal is to provide a stable setting where many can
safely worship, celebrate and find peace. We invite you to join in this
journey. You can help by:

<p><strong>Who we are and What we do:</strong></p>
<p>Battlefield Addiction is a team of recovered addicts, community and family members working together to fill the gaps that currently exist in the treatment/recovery world.  We work powerfully with and through family members who have a loved one struggling with addiction. We work in partnership with treatment centers, Intensive outpatient programs and sober living facilities that support our <i><u>Family First approach</u></i>.</p>

<p>WE CAN DO THIS!!!</p>
<p>Breast Cancer has touched nearly everyone's life in one way or another.  Either directly, or through a mother, an aunt, a sister, a friend, or another loved one.  Many of us have gone to doctor's appointments, treatments, or cared for a loved one during their treatment praying for a full recovery... </p>
<p>But what happens when a woman has a mastectomy and needs access to a bra shop to purchase breast prostheses and bras? If she lives north of the Alderwood Mall in Lynnwood, Washington, the choices are limited or nonexistent and she will likely need to travel a significant distant for this service. More importantly, there is no bra shop north of the mall that can directly bill Medicare or Medicaid. Since the closure of Virginia's Feminine Boutique in May 2012, breast cancer survivors have had no option but to order these products online without the option of a proper fitting or travel elsewhere for this needed service. <b>Citrine Health's new program, The Bra Shop, is determined to change that-- regardless of a woman's ability to pay!</b></p>
<p>The Bra Shop will contract with insurance companies, allowing women to access prostheses and bras without having to pay out-of-pocket. All post mastectomy women need some type of prosthesis and bra, even if they choose to have reconstructive surgery later. The average cost for a breast prosthesis is $230 and related bra i<span>s $60. Many women can’t afford the cost of these items and rely on insurance and/or Medicare or Medicaid.  This service is crucial-- Finding the right breast prosthesis and proper fitting bra can be an important step for many breast cancer survivors to begin healing and feel whole again.</span></p>
<p><b>This campaign will help toward raising the $75,000 start up costs needed for The Bra Shop including inventory, hardware, computer software, personnel and training.</b></p>
<p><b>If The Bra Shop is not funded, breast cancer survivors will continue to drive great distances to purchase a basic item...  At an already difficult point in their lives, many women will be stretched financially or incur debt to purchase a bra and prosthesis. Many will not be able to get one at all.</b></p>
<p>I hope you will consider donating to this much needed service for low-income breast cancer patients and <b><i>all gifts are tax deductible as Citrine Health is a 501(c)3, non-profit agency.  </i></b>We can do this!!!<br/></p>

<p><strong>A few things you should know about our company:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we believe KNOWLEDGE should be universal, especially in the health sector;</li>
<li>we believe in COOPERATION as sharing information and connecting with different professionals is the path toward the future;</li>
<li>we believe in a holistic approach BEYOND the concept of DUALISM: standardization vs personalization, of mind vs heart, of science vs art - there is room for all here;</li>
<li>we want to create the most EFFICIENT results possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is our dream to CHANGE THE WORLD OF HEALTH THROUGH SHARING AND CONNECTING.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you should know about us:</strong></p>
<p>We are a multidisciplinary, multifaceted team of practitioners, instructors, innovators, experimenters and programmers. We care about wellness and are working to share it through a comprehensive project that will help practitioners take their work to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Our Project</strong></p>
<p>Knowlative is an Integrated Web Platform and Professional App. It will launch as an App for Holistic Health Practitioners, starting with Kinesiologists, but its goals are far more inclusive than that. Every-one of us can be part of Knowlative and benefit from it!</p>
<p><i><u>A Service for Health Practitioners</u></i></p>
<p>Knowlative is a vehicle for professional work: client records, networking, organization, statistics, and research at your fingertip. With a simple and rapid user interface, Knowlative gives you access to the best techniques available, ready to be used immediately in your client sessions.</p>
<p><i><u>A Showcase for your Activity</u></i></p>
<p>Continuous improvement is the key to personal and professional achievements and discoveries. Knowlative gives you a place to share your classes, credentials and ideas with a community of professionals. Reach out to a community of peers and support each other while also marketing your events.</p>
<p><i><u>A Support for Schools and Associations</u></i></p>
<p>Health education is the key universal well-being. Education comes from training and knowledge. Knowlative supports schools and associations to advertise courses and educational programs. With a selected audience of professionals, Knowlative offers you just the right community for your classes.</p>
<p><i><u>A Common Language</u></i></p>
<p>Have you ever read a term in a kinesiology book or heard a reference to something in a class that you didn’t understand? In order to communicate efficiently between professionals, a common language is necessary. Knowlative's blog and dictionary; procedures and techniques, can be modified and approved by the Knowlative community of professionals (like Wikipedia for kinesiologists). Knowlative is the platform for sharing and building a common path for understanding.</p>
<p><i><u>A New Source of Revenue</u></i></p>
<p>Knowlative rewards every contributor to the platform! If you have a new life-changing technique or protocol you want to share and spread to the world, you have come to the right place: add the technique to our database and be rewarded based on its use in our community.</p>
<p><i><u>And Much More</u></i></p>
<p>Knowlative's goals are wide ranging and new projects are already starting up from this platform. Gathering the data of what techniques are being used most throughout our community will allow us to publish meaningful statistics of what works for our clients internationally. Through new courses and educational projects and even to the organization of clinics, Knowlative is a brand that aims to deeply change the way we consider holistic health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Help make a difference and build the future of natural health!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need your help in order to launch this project that will change the complementary health world. To show our appreciation for your generous support we are offering membership packages to contributors, including the opportunity to reserve yourself lifetime access to the knowledge created in our system.</p>
<p>The estimated costs to launch the kind of interactive software we have in mind, including initial IT and management costs is over $ 30,000. We are hoping to raise $20,000 of this through this campaign so we can get this project out to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p><i><u>Great perks are available too!!</u></i></p>
<p>As a thank-you for your support we will shout your name so everyone can hear it: it will show up on Knowlative’s website and in our Hall of Fame in our new head office. You then can choose either to receive the SPECIAL EDITION KNOWLATIVE T-SHIRT...</p>

<p><strong>Where is your money going?</strong></p>
<p><i><u>Step 0 - Company incorporation</u></i><br/>Main costs about this step are linked to legal and consultancy aspects of company incorporation. We already spent around €4.000 to complete this step.<br/><i><u>Step 1 - Study the static content</u></i><br/>There are little costs associated with this phase except some fees to our graphic consultant and  Wordpress plug-ins we need to buy.

</div></div>","A few things you should know about our company:

we believe KNOWLEDGE should be universal, especially in the health sector;
we believe in COOPERATION as sharing information and connecting with different professionals is the path toward the future;
we believe in a holistic approach BEYOND the concept of DUALISM: standardization vs personalization, of mind vs heart, of science vs art - there is room for all here;
we want to create the most EFFICIENT results possible.

It is our dream to CHANGE THE WORLD OF HEALTH THROUGH SHARING AND CONNECTING.
 
What you should know about us:
We are a multidisciplinary, multifaceted team of practitioners, instructors, innovators, experimenters and programmers. We care about wellness and are working to share it through a comprehensive project that will help practitioners take their work to the next level.
Our Project
Knowlative is an Integrated Web Platform and Professional App. It will launch as an App for Holistic Health Practitioners, starting with Kinesiologists, but its goals are far more inclusive than that. Every-one of us can be part of Knowlative and benefit from it!
A Service for Health Practitioners
Knowlative is a vehicle for professional work: client records, networking, organization, statistics, and research at your fingertip. With a simple and rapid user interface, Knowlative gives you access to the best techniques available, ready to be used immediately in your client sessions.
A Showcase for your Activity
Continuous improvement is the key to personal and professional achievements and discoveries. Knowlative gives you a place to share your classes, credentials and ideas with a community of professionals. Reach out to a community of peers and support each other while also marketing your events.
A Support for Schools and Associations
Health education is the key universal well-being. Education comes from training and knowledge. Knowlative supports schools and associations to advertise courses and educational programs. With a selected audience of professionals, Knowlative offers you just the right community for your classes.
A Common Language
Have you ever read a term in a kinesiology book or heard a reference to something in a class that you didn’t understand? In order to communicate efficiently between professionals, a common language is necessary. Knowlative's blog and dictionary; procedures and techniques, can be modified and approved by the Knowlative community of professionals (like Wikipedia for kinesiologists). Knowlative is the platform for sharing and building a common path for understanding.
A New Source of Revenue
Knowlative rewards every contributor to the platform! If you have a new life-changing technique or protocol you want to share and spread to the world, you have come to the right place: add the technique to our database and be rewarded based on its use in our community.
And Much More
Knowlative's goals are wide ranging and new projects are already starting up from this platform. Gathering the data of what techniques are being used most throughout our community will allow us to publish meaningful statistics of what works for our clients internationally. Through new courses and educational projects and even to the organization of clinics, Knowlative is a brand that aims to deeply change the way we consider holistic health.
 
Help make a difference and build the future of natural health!
 
What We Need & What You Get
We need your help in order to launch this project that will change the complementary health world. To show our appreciation for your generous support we are offering membership packages to contributors, including the opportunity to reserve yourself lifetime access to the knowledge created in our system.
The estimated costs to launch the kind of interactive software we have in mind, including initial IT and management costs is over $ 30,000. We are hoping to raise $20,000 of this through this campaign so we can get this project out to you as soon as possible.
Great perks are available too!!
As a thank-you for your support we will shout your name so everyone can hear it: it will show up on Knowlative’s website and in our Hall of Fame in our new head office. You then can choose either to receive the SPECIAL EDITION KNOWLATIVE T-SHIRT...

Or... the magnificent KNOWLATIVE HOODIE!

And, last but not least, you can receive access to one of our Operator's Packages, with Lifetime access to our platform.

We already spent around €4.000 to complete this step.Step 1 - Study the static contentThere are little costs associated with this phase except some fees to our graphic consultant and  Wordpress plug-ins we need to buy.

<h3><strong>STILLNESS OVER STRESS. WHY IS THIS SPACE IMPORTANT?</strong></h3>
<p>According to the American Psychological Association, chronic stress is linked to the six leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver and suicide. And more than 75 percent of all physician office visits are for stress-related ailments and complaints.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO CREATE?</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to create a sacred space, in which all people, especially women and people of color, feel safe nurtured and encouraged to work through the physical, mental and emotional challenges of their daily lives in order to experience mind, body, spirit health and energetic balance. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556249031/oduovjpqxddyp7ya25be.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our space will provide movement meditation classes, sound healing, women's circles, ceremonial gatherings and educational workshops in our main room. And various forms of energetic healing, guidance, therapy and alternative medicine in our three back private rooms. There will also be a retail aspect of the space which will house crystals, books, meditation tools, and sound healing instruments in the front entrance.  </p>

<p>Janelle, Antoinette and  Trisha are the partners behind Jupiter Soundscape LLC. Each of these women bring to the table their own powerful story behind their own self healing and also their unique skill set which makes the Jupiter Soundscape concept so unique.</p>
<p>Janelle is fashion industry veteran of 20 years, who after experiencing many earth shattering pregnancy losses and an infertility diagnosis received the miracle (a child) which set her out on her path to be a lightworker through the modality of sound healing. </p>
<p>Antoinette, a yoga teacher and former yoga studio owner, is a evidential medium, and shamanic reiki healer doing much pro bono work with cancer patients. </p>
<p>Patricia, a techie by day and restauranteur by night, is the co founder and owner of many thriving businesses in the LA area and a certified sound healer and movement meditation leader.</p>
<p>All three of us are committed to the practice of healing. There is too much going on in this world in terms of numbing, suppressing, violence, chaos and sickness. If we can have this space to allow people to heal and work through all the things in their lives which they feel they can no longer accept, we know we can create a great ripple effect that will energetically shift our local and global community. This work needs to be accessible to all people. We are committed to doing this work for ourselves, for our families and for everyone that has ever needed a place to go to reconnect with themselves and their inner power once again. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>HOW DID WE GET THIS IDEA? </i></strong></p>
<p>We simply looked around at our community and saw the lack of this type of space and service in areas in our proximity. We felt the disparity in that to obtain these type of services, education or to be in this type of space people in this community were required to travel almost 30 miles away. Our goal is to make these types of practices accessible in our community and give back to the place we grew up in.</p>
<p><strong>Today we need your help in acheiving our goal of $44,444. </strong>By contributing to our cause you will be helping us to create an great shift in mind, body and soul for an entire community in the West Covina, Walnut, SGV and IE areas. </p>

<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>There is no space like this in this area, so with your generous contribution you are bringing the accessibility for education and service of the culmination of many ancient technologies for the purpose of healing.</p>
<p>We are working on setting up a program that allows us to do pro bono work with cancer patients. Many of our parents, loved ones and friends have passed from this disease and you will be helping us to provide an outlet and an alternative to those who may have begun to feel incurable and hopeless. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Many people are still unaware of the benefits of our healing modalities.  But we are committed to providing education surrounding these healing technologies that have been used in ancient cultures for thousands of years. We also have a myriad of practitioners and teachers under our umbrella that have already establlished clientele waiting for a permanent space to call home.  These practitioners and teachers have garnered strong word of mouth referrals as a result of their powerful and effective methods of allowing their clients to realize their inherent wholeness.</p>
<p>Another posed risk is other competitors in the field of yoga, meditation and healing arts facilities. However our strategic location as well as unique approach using wholistic vibration medicine; sound, crystals movement and alternative healing therapies, differentiate our space from other yoga studios, healing arts spaces as well as metaphysical shops.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Nish and I've created a natural, FDA compliant solution to end rough mornings after a night out. I have a background in Chemistry and Biology, and have a diverse range of work experience - including Tesla and other engineering firms. The DHM team is a passionate group of scientists (biology/chemistry, geophysics, genetics &amp; biochemistry), athletes, entrepreneurs and productivity seekers.</p>
<p>We've been working on DHM for close to a year and have created a product that is backed by science and optimized to help avoid feeling awful after a night out. DHM was made so you can enjoy your nights and still maximize productivity the next day. Now it's time to share it with the world!</p>
<p>DHM is manufactured in Canada at a leading manufacturer that use CGMP (Current Goods Manufacturing Practices), a facility that adheres to the standards of the FDA and other regulatory bodies internationally! All ingredients undergo extensive testing for safety, purity and stability.</p>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>As a backer, you'll be making a huge difference in our lives and will be responsible for helping us achieve our first round of large scale production! Funds raised will be going to production and a small portion will be donated to the Liver Foundation - a group that promotes liver health and balance. We're offering our backers up to 30% off + free shipping, and are excited to get DHM to you! We will do our very best to ship your order out no later than the end of July!</p>

I have a background in Chemistry and Biology, and have a diverse range of work experience - including Tesla and other engineering firms. The DHM team is a passionate group of scientists (biology/chemistry, geophysics, genetics & biochemistry), athletes, entrepreneurs and productivity seekers.
We've been working on DHM for close to a year and have created a product that is backed by science and optimized to help avoid feeling awful after a night out. DHM was made so you can enjoy your nights and still maximize productivity the next day. Now it's time to share it with the world!
DHM is manufactured in Canada at a leading manufacturer that use CGMP (Current Goods Manufacturing Practices), a facility that adheres to the standards of the FDA and other regulatory bodies internationally! All ingredients undergo extensive testing for safety, purity and stability.
Your Impact
As a backer, you'll be making a huge difference in our lives and will be responsible for helping us achieve our first round of large scale production! Funds raised will be going to production and a small portion will be donated to the Liver Foundation - a group that promotes liver health and balance. We're offering our backers up to 30% off + free shipping, and are excited to get DHM to you! We will do our very best to ship your order out no later than the end of July!
If you can't contribute, that's ok. We would love if you could share our campaign with your friends and family.

Thank you!</strong></h3><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Frequently Asked Questions about MaxWell Pet</strong></h3><p><strong>Do MaxWell Pet formulas cause any side effects?</strong></p><p>There are no known side effects and there have been no reported adverse events as a result of dogs being given any of the formulas. However, you should not give ANY product if your pet has known allergies to any of the ingredients.</p><p><strong>I have dogs of different sizes. Do they all get the same amount of MaxWell Pet?</strong></p><p>Most dogs will do just fine with 1.0 ml (the dropper is marked) at a time. Very small breeds (Chihuahuas, Yorkies, etc.) can be started at half that amount and very large breeds (Great Danes, Mastiffs, etc.) might require a bit more. The amount and/or frequency can be safely adjusted to suit your dog’s needs.  </p><p><strong>Can I give my dog MaxWell Pet while she’s pregnant and lactating?</strong></p><p>No adverse reactions have been reported as a result of giving MaxWell Pet during this time. However, while pregnant or lactating, it is advisable to seek the advice of your veterinarian before giving these products.</p><p><strong>There’s alcohol in MaxWell Pet. Why?</strong></p><p>The alcohol present in MaxWell Pet is a necessary part of the manufacturing process. Some of the active plant-based ingredients used in these formulas are only soluble in alcohol, without which these powerful substances could not be extracted. There are only trace amounts in a single dose and this amount is not harmful to animals. </p><p><strong>Can I give MaxWell Pet if my dog is also taking a prescription drug?</strong></p><p>There have been no reported cases of interactions between MaxWell Pet  and prescription drugs. The formulas have been found by many dog owners to be useful while weaning off certain medications. Ask your veterinarian if this might benefit your pet.</p><p><strong>Will MaxWell Pet interfere with my pet’s nutritional supplements?</strong></p><p>Not only do MaxWell Pet formulas not interfere with nutritional supplements, they actually enhance the utilization of certain minerals and other nutritional substances.</p><p><strong>Can more than one formula be given at the same time?</strong></p><p>Yes. All of the MaxWell Pet formulas are compatible with each other and will retain their individual effectiveness when given together.</p><p><strong>How long will it take to see results?</strong></p><p>This will vary from animal to animal. Most respond quickly, often with the first few dose. In other instances, depending on how severe or how long the problem has been going on, it may take several weeks to produce the desired effect.</p><p><strong>Will my pet need to take MaxWell Pet forever?</strong></p><p>The MaxWell Pet formulas were not developed to mask symptoms but to assist in bringing the body back to a state of health. Once the desired result has been achieved, the formulas may then be taken on an as-needed basis. However, the formulas do act preventatively and you may continue giving your pet MaxWell Pet formulas indefinitely without any harm.</p><p><strong>What are the ingredients?</strong></p><p>All of the MaxWell Pet formulas contain a combination of three types of ingredients known as biotherapies. The three we use are gemmotherapy, lithotherapy and organotherapy. Gemmotherapy are extracts made from the buds and other actively growing parts of plants that stimulate and optimize cell function much like stem-cell therapy. Lithotherapy are made from mineral-rich rocks that are reduced to a fine powder and bioenergetically enhanced. This allows for immediate absorption and optimization of mineral balance in the cells where they act as catalysts for enzyme reactions. Organotherapy are homeopathic preparations of healthy glands and other tissue. It activates the immune system and restores and balances normal function.</p><p><strong>Hip &amp; Joint</strong></p><p>A proprietary blend of: Black Currant buds; European Grape Vine buds; Mountain Pine buds; Wild Woodvine young shoots; Orpiment; Quadratic Feldspar; Cartilage extract; Ligament extract.</p><p><strong>Skin &amp; Allergy</strong></p><p>A proprietary blend of: Black Currant buds; English Elm buds; European Walnut buds; Rye Grain rootlets; Conglomerate; Galena; Dermal extract; Pineal gland extract.</p><p><strong>Calm &amp; Happy</strong></p><p>A proprietary blend of: Ash Tree buds; Fig Tree buds; Lime Tree buds; Silver Birch seeds; Lepidolite; Tourmaline; Adrenal gland extract; Hypothalamus extract.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Biotherapies - Selected Bibliography</strong></h3><p>Bouko Levy, Michael, MD – <i>Homeopathic and Drainage Repertory</i>. 1992, Editions Similia.

My unique Biotherapy Formulas have produced truly unprecedented results for many of my patients' most pressing health concerns, and have already sold over 100,000 bottles nationwide. My passion extends to animals - I have treated all my pets with my formulas, with amazing results. You may not realize it, but many veterinary prescriptions can have the same kinds of side effects as those for humans. For instance, when you bring your dog in for pain management, the doctor might prescribe pills to help the pain...even though the pills cause incontinence. How crazy is that? I decided to create MaxWell Pet to give our dogs the same high quality of care that we give to ourselves.Based on customer testimonials, I can confidently say that MaxWell Pet remedies are effective natural solutions for common dog ailments - solutions with zero side effects. management, the doctor might prescribe pills to help the pain...even See for yourselves what our customers have to say: ""Vincent is 10 years old and his painful hips were really slowing him down. With MaxWell Pet Hip & Joint he’s running around like a 2 year old again.​""Isabel Madley ""Maggie Mae is a ten year old Lab who suffers from seasonal allergies. Her itching makes her miserable and robs both her and us of sleep. Doc Stuart's Skin & Allergy formula works. We keep several bottles in the cupboard.""Diane Campbell & Ray Moreau  Take Hip & Joint For Example... Our intention for the money you contribute is to educate pet parents about the natural alternatives to drugs with harmful side effects. We are a movement of people who love our dogs, and we know that these formulas will help our best friends live a healthy and happy life.Please become a part of that movement to help all dogs live longer and better. You can share this mission on your favorite social channels and let your friends know in the dog park. Let's make a better dog world together.Join us by making a contribution now. Thank you! Frequently Asked Questions about MaxWell PetDo MaxWell Pet formulas cause any side effects?There are no known side effects and there have been no reported adverse events as a result of dogs being given any of the formulas. However, you should not give ANY product if your pet has known allergies to any of the ingredients.I have dogs of different sizes. Do they all get the same amount of MaxWell Pet?Most dogs will do just fine with 1.0 ml (the dropper is marked) at a time. Very small breeds (Chihuahuas, Yorkies, etc.) can be started at half that amount and very large breeds (Great Danes, Mastiffs, etc.) might require a bit more. The amount and/or frequency can be safely adjusted to suit your dog’s needs.  Can I give my dog MaxWell Pet while she’s pregnant and lactating?No adverse reactions have been reported as a result of giving MaxWell Pet during this time. However, while pregnant or lactating, it is advisable to seek the advice of your veterinarian before giving these products.There’s alcohol in MaxWell Pet. Why?The alcohol present in MaxWell Pet is a necessary part of the manufacturing process. Some of the active plant-based ingredients used in these formulas are only soluble in alcohol, without which these powerful substances could not be extracted. There are only trace amounts in a single dose and this amount is not harmful to animals. Can I give MaxWell Pet if my dog is also taking a prescription drug?There have been no reported cases of interactions between MaxWell Pet  and prescription drugs. The formulas have been found by many dog owners to be useful while weaning off certain medications. Ask your veterinarian if this might benefit your pet.Will MaxWell Pet interfere with my pet’s nutritional supplements?Not only do MaxWell Pet formulas not interfere with nutritional supplements, they actually enhance the utilization of certain minerals and other nutritional substances.Can more than one formula be given at the same time?Yes. All of the MaxWell Pet formulas are compatible with each other and will retain their individual effectiveness when given together.How long will it take to see results?This will vary from animal to animal. Most respond quickly, often with the first few dose. In other instances, depending on how severe or how long the problem has been going on, it may take several weeks to produce the desired effect.Will my pet need to take MaxWell Pet forever?The MaxWell Pet formulas were not developed to mask symptoms but to assist in bringing the body back to a state of health. Once the desired result has been achieved, the formulas may then be taken on an as-needed basis. However, the formulas do act preventatively and you may continue giving your pet MaxWell Pet formulas indefinitely without any harm.What are the ingredients?All of the MaxWell Pet formulas contain a combination of three types of ingredients known as biotherapies. The three we use are gemmotherapy, lithotherapy and organotherapy. Gemmotherapy are extracts made from the buds and other actively growing parts of plants that stimulate and optimize cell function much like stem-cell therapy. Lithotherapy are made from mineral-rich rocks that are reduced to a fine powder and bioenergetically enhanced. This allows for immediate absorption and optimization of mineral balance in the cells where they act as catalysts for enzyme reactions. Organotherapy are homeopathic preparations of healthy glands and other tissue. It activates the immune system and restores and balances normal function.Hip & JointA proprietary blend of: Black Currant buds; European Grape Vine buds; Mountain Pine buds; Wild Woodvine young shoots; Orpiment; Quadratic Feldspar; Cartilage extract; Ligament extract.Skin & AllergyA proprietary blend of: Black Currant buds; English Elm buds; European Walnut buds; Rye Grain rootlets; Conglomerate; Galena; Dermal extract; Pineal gland extract.Calm & HappyA proprietary blend of: Ash Tree buds; Fig Tree buds; Lime Tree buds; Silver Birch seeds; Lepidolite; Tourmaline; Adrenal gland extract; Hypothalamus extract. Biotherapies - Selected BibliographyBouko Levy, Michael, MD – Homeopathic and Drainage Repertory. 1992, Editions Similia.

tools for transformation we offer at The Urban Temple are potent, impactful and
expand consciousness. Communication tools, energy healing, spiritual
counseling, improvised ritual experiences, belief restructuring, sound healing,
yoga fusion, shamanic dance… these are all modalities that are based on ancient
wisdom mixed with the innovation of modern times. They are highly effective and
don’t normally fit into regular wellness centers or yoga studios. By giving
these modalities a physical space, we make more space for them in the world and
amplify their healing and transformational reach. By creating this Temple we
are exemplifying a new paradigm that supports alternative healers and shamanic
practices and integrates them into daily life.<br/></p>
<p>         As
a Holistic Professional and a Practicing Mystic, I offer a wide variety of
teachings and healing modalities, including yoga, holistic nutrition, tantric
energy healing, spiritual counseling and shamanic dance. With my wide range of
offerings and my shamanic style I found I often don’t totally fit in to
traditional yoga studios and wellness centers. This produces a problem for me
and other metaphysical teachers and healers. It is hard to find spaces to host
our events and sessions, and our community and our practices are fragmented
because we don’t have a well-fitting space to hold them. I created The Urban
Temple for people like me: metaphysical healers, teachers, ritualists and
seekers who want to create more space for their work in the world and share,
heal, connect and grow.</p>
<p>         I
have held a long time dream and vision of creating alternative healing centers
and temples all over the world. Three years ago I ran a community and ritual
center out of my house in Oakland for one year, called Mystic Activation
Temple. It was amazing to see how many people showed up for our events and
classes. There is such a need for spaces to gather in this way. The past three
years since then have been rich in education and experience for me, and now The
Urban Temple is the next incarnation of my visions manifesting.</p>
<p>         These
modalities and experiences we will offer at The Urban Temple are incredibly
transformational for the participants and the world. We feel strongly that true
planetary healing begins within, and the more we evolve ourselves, the more our
world will shift to reflect our inner peace and harmony. </p><p><br/></p><p>Modalities Offered:</p><p>- Kundalini Tantra Dance</p><p>-Theta Healing</p><p>-Tantric Energy Healing</p><p>- Reiki</p><p>- Spiritual Counseling</p><p>- Holistic Nutrition</p><p>- Sound Healing</p><p>- Zegg Forum</p><p>- Imagination Healing Circle</p><p>- Shamanic Journey</p><p>- Meditation</p><p>-Yoga</p><p>- Kundalini Yoga</p><p>- Educational and Empowerment Workshops</p><p>Plus:</p><p>- Community Rituals</p><p>- Women's Circles</p><p>- Art Shows</p><p>- Local Artisan and Crystal Store (Coming Soon!)</p><p>- Community Clinic (Donation Based Healing) (Coming Soon!)</p><p><br/></p><p>...and so much more!!!</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FwntOBZVQzjE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwntOBZVQzjE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FwntOBZVQzjE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p></p>
<p>We have created a lot already, yet to really make our space
feel like a temple and a sanctuary for healing we’ll need a few things.
Everything we currently have has been free or donated, and we plan to continue
to use re-claimed and donated materials as much as possible and build and sew
for ourselves when we can. </p><p>The main things we need are:</p>
<p><b>Flooring!</b></p>
<p></p><p>The current floor in the space is a rough industrial carpet. This is suitable for yoga and community <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">meetings, but it’s too rough for dancing or easy cleaning. We want to acquire Zebra Mats, which are </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">movable interlocking floor pieces. They have the look of a wood floor, the feel of a dance studio, and are </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">easy to clean. Instead of removing the carpeting and installing new hardwood floors, the Zebra Mats faux-</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">floor will cover the entire interior carpet.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p>We also plan to acquire soft rugs to cover the floor, allowing the space to easily convert between a <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">dance studio, a classroom and a gathering ground.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Lighting!</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The overhead lighting is a generic, harsh fluorescent lighting suspended from our high ceilings. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We’ve been using our own softer light fixtures, and never turn on the main lighting. We believe proper </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">lighting is a very important aspect of creating a healing space where people feel comfortable. We want to </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">remove the fluorescent strips and install a large chandelier or similar fixture, which will be refurbished or </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">from a local artist. We’ll get smaller lights for low lighting.</span></p>
<p></p><p><b>Sound Blocking Curtains!</b></p><p>Mystic Doorway is located on busy Telegraph Ave. This is great for accessibility, but we also get a <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">fair amount of street noise in the space. It is important for us to buffer the sound that comes through the </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">main windows, upper ventilation windows and doorway. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have planned a great way to make soundproof curtains by using two rolls of rubber MLV </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">material, each sized at 25’ x 4’, in combination with heavy fabrics. The MLV is the type of rubber used in </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">professional stage curtains, and we will sew the fabric around it to create large, heavy-duty curtains. </span></p><p><b>Shelves, Cubbies &amp; Storage!</b></p><p>The space is a blank canvas – it is a large open rectangle with high ceilings and a restroom. We need <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to build a storage closet, create a reception area and build cubbies for people to store their belongings.</span></p><p><b>Yoga Mats and Props, Pillows, Chairs!</b></p><p>We need yoga mats and props for 10 students, 20 pillows for floor seating and chairs for participants <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">who would prefer not to sit on the ground.</span></p><p><b>Temple Décor and Supplies!</b></p><p>We hope to deepen the integrity of the space with beautiful fabrics, art plants, large crystals and a <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">water fountain. Our space already has some beautiful items in it thank you to the thoughtful gifts and </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">donations from the community. Décor will be final portion of our spending budget.</span></p><p><b>Website, Graphic Design, Advertising Materials!</b></p><p>We’re proud to have our website up and running, but we will need assistance with branding and <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">advertising. We’ll be working with a graphic designer to create a beautiful logo and color scheme for our </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">center.

I had my laptop on my lap, where I was not only working on a video project, but also had my browser open and was interacting with a few different websites at once; chatting in one window, scrolling endlessly in another... If that weren’t enough, I was also texting three different people on my phone; making plans with one, counseling another, and making idle chit-chat with the third.<br/><br/>And I was frustrated. Frustrated because I wanted to look at the next thing on my website, but I was also trying to make progress on my project. Yet every time I opened my video program back up, a text would come through that I wanted to respond to. Then I’d rewind the television show a minute or two because I hadn’t been paying attention and it looked like something important had happened. After rewinding, I turned back to the video program, only to have a message pop up on my computer chat.<br/><br/>It was around this time that I had a revelation. I realized suddenly that even though I was doing all of these things at once, <i>I wasn’t actually doing any of them at all</i>. Every time I started to make progress on something, my attention was stolen by something else. I was giving in to every whim that surrounded me. Did I mention that my roommate was trying to talk to me as well?<br/><br/>Eventually, I became restless with this arrangement and started experimenting with making a few changes. I made it a point to pay attention to how many things I was doing at one time, and decided that if I were going to work on a project, maybe I didn’t need to pay as much attention to websites or my phone. If I was watching a show, maybe I could take my focus specifically there, and put down my computer for the duration of the episode. If I were talking to someone, maybe I should really try to hear what they were saying, rather than simply waiting for my turn to talk.<br/><br/>But there was a problem. Though I had recognized the issue and started experimenting with new ways of approaching the obligations and responsibilities in front of me, I still had years of practice operating in an entirely different way. It was like traveling to the same office every day for a decade, then getting a new job at a new building on the opposite side of town. For a long time after you may get in the car and automatically start going in the direction you’re used to, maybe getting all the way to the office before realizing you’re at the wrong place.<br/><br/>Eventually, I found the solution to my issue. I don’t want to say yoga was love at first sight, but it was something new, and it felt good. Despite the fact that when I would fold forward, my hands would barely reach past my knees, there was something about going to the class and performing the asanas that felt like healing. I would consistently leave the class feeling better than I did when I went in, both physically and mentally. Of course, my new yoga practice was healing me- though I didn’t know why at the time.<br/><br/>What I learned later on was that, in addition to the asanas, I was practicing something below the surface. As I moved through the postures, learning to focus on the feeling of my body, I was also practicing how to quiet my mind, to focus on the present moment, and to discard unnecessary distractions. I realized that the things I was physically experiencing could be used as targets for mindfulness, and that mindfulness could be applied outside the yoga studio as well as within.<br/><br/>It wasn’t long before I came to another revelation: the things we practice on the mat in a yoga class aren’t meant to stay there. The physical practice of yoga is, in reality, a spiritual and mental practice of mindfulness- which can be called upon at any time and applied anywhere you like! By practicing yoga, you’re doing more than moving from posture to posture, you’re training your mind to operate more efficiently.<br/><br/>This book is about that phenomenon. There’s so much that we learn in class on our mats, yet many of us leave these lessons behind after Savasana, the final resting pose. However, my belief is that we can apply these lessons whenever we need them, even outside of class. What I’d like to give to the readers of this book is not only the awareness of these hidden lessons, but also the knowledge of how to call upon them and apply them in your daily life.<br/><br/>This book will investigate individual asana postures and sequences, and apply them outside the studio. That’s not to say this book is only for those of us who practice the yoga asanas. My hope is that anyone, even someone who has never entered a yoga studio, can apply these ideas to their daily lives. So regardless of whether you’re a novice, a guru, or have never done an asana in your life, this book will help you perfect <strong>Yoga Off The Mat</strong>.</p><p>Find a longer preview of the book on <a href=""http://www.yotmbook.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.yotmbook.com</a>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550497599/wqalimimvqqdtogp7zct.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>","** Be sure to check out the Updates page!

CST is rooted in Osteopathy and focuses on balancing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spinal cord, sending a calming message to the central nervous system, which facilitates an “unlocking” of restrictions and decompression of the cranium, bones along the spinal column, and sacrum.   </p><p>AquaCranial Therapy was developed over 20 years ago by Rebecca Goff combining gentle, yet powerful, non-invasive techniques, that are paired with rhythmic movements, made by observing wild dolphins and whales. The ocean simulates a womb-like feeling that creates a nurturing space and safe haven where the recipient can let go and fall into a blissful state of mind.  The combination results in an effective protocol that releases pain, pressure &amp; tension, and increases range of motion and flexibility from head to toe.  After the treatment recipients are assisted out of the water (as they may be in an altered state) and encouraged to lay down and re-calibrate in stillness…embracing an overall state of well-being and ultimate relaxation!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><u><strong>AquaCranial Therapy Sessions Address &amp; Reduce the Effects of the Following Ailments:</strong></u></i></p><ul>

She received her first AquaCranial Therapy treatment and was astounded by the results: Increased circulation and blood flow as well as flexibility, relief of pain &amp; pressure, powerful emotional release &amp; an altered state of relaxation ~  an overall euphoric experience! The results of her sessions changed her life so profoundly she decided to embark on a mission to follow her calling and new-found purpose, dedicating her efforts to heightening awareness on the modality and share it with the world.​</p><p>Anabel &amp; Penny are passionate, dedicated &amp; driven to share this modality with as many people as possible to help our community feel revitalized, inside and out!  They would like to pursue serving the ohana (community) up close and personal with compassion and enthusiasm, providing relief for adults and keiki (children) challenged with trauma-induced impairments ; mental, physical and emotional.

CST is rooted in Osteopathy and focuses on balancing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spinal cord, sending a calming message to the central nervous system, which facilitates an “unlocking” of restrictions and decompression of the cranium, bones along the spinal column, and sacrum.   AquaCranial Therapy was developed over 20 years ago by Rebecca Goff combining gentle, yet powerful, non-invasive techniques, that are paired with rhythmic movements, made by observing wild dolphins and whales. The ocean simulates a womb-like feeling that creates a nurturing space and safe haven where the recipient can let go and fall into a blissful state of mind.  The combination results in an effective protocol that releases pain, pressure & tension, and increases range of motion and flexibility from head to toe.  After the treatment recipients are assisted out of the water (as they may be in an altered state) and encouraged to lay down and re-calibrate in stillness…embracing an overall state of well-being and ultimate relaxation!AquaCranial Therapy Sessions Address & Reduce the Effects of the Following Ailments:
Chronic Neck/Back Pain & Inflammation of Joints & Soft Tissue
Headaches, Migraines, & Temporomandibular Joint Syndrome (TMJ)
Mood disorders ~ Depression, Bi-Polar, & Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

 TEAM ALOHA AQUACRANIAL - WHO ARE WE & WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO US?Penny and Anabel met on the Garden Isle of Kauaʻi while attending basic AquaCranial training.   They realized there were like-minded goals between the two of them and decided to join forces in pursuit of  attaining AquaCranial certification.  Next phase of the process would consist of traveling to complete advanced training in deep seas of  Bimini, Bahamas and Tonga, Oceania ~ a unique element that allows the opportunity to treat clients alongside dolphins and whales while connecting with the healing energies of  sound and vibration.  ​Here's a bit of information about us... Penny holds a PADI Advanced Open Water Certification and embraces the culture and richness of the islands as a student of Hawaiian Studies. Her love and respect for the ocean and itsʻ plethora of fascinating creatures also inspires her photography.  After traveling the world and studying various healing modalities, within 5 minutes of her first AquaCranial treatment Penny knew to look no further - this was the modality for her!​Anabel is a Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT) with a background in Nursing, who has a passion for alternative modalities - bridging the gap and engaging elements of nature, our “teachers” if you will, to promote and restore balance and well-being.  In June of 2015 Anabel fractured several vertebrae, sprained her neck, and suffered spinal whiplash from a diving accident, forcing her to retreat inward and surrender to months of recovery in stillness, as surgery was not a viable option.  In February of 2016, intuition led her to attend an AquaCranial training on Maui with Rebecca Goff. She received her first AquaCranial Therapy treatment and was astounded by the results: Increased circulation and blood flow as well as flexibility, relief of pain & pressure, powerful emotional release & an altered state of relaxation ~  an overall euphoric experience! The results of her sessions changed her life so profoundly she decided to embark on a mission to follow her calling and new-found purpose, dedicating her efforts to heightening awareness on the modality and share it with the world.​Anabel & Penny are passionate, dedicated & driven to share this modality with as many people as possible to help our community feel revitalized, inside and out!  They would like to pursue serving the ohana (community) up close and personal with compassion and enthusiasm, providing relief for adults and keiki (children) challenged with trauma-induced impairments ; mental, physical and emotional. As these two AquaCranial Therapists continue to step into their role & join forces with other organizations to heighten awareness & overall benefits of this therapy, a sense of peace, joy, unity & continued state of well-being is restored.Knowledge is power so let's celebrate that we are sovereign beings & as we share our ideas and experiences​, our communities thrive and flourish, raising our natural vibration. Team Aloha AquaCranial are trailblazers and believe in building solid foundations on pillars of optimal wellness and promote a balanced mind, body, and spirit so we can spearhead a movement unlike any other and as Gandhi would so eloquently put it ~ Be the change you want to see in the world!. We are including some information on ​Dolphin Therapy which is recognized along with Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) and is gaining increased recognition in the scientific field. We are quite excited to see more evidence-based research highlighting the the advantages of Dolphin Therapy; especially interacting with children challenged in the areas of speech, behaviors and motor skills. Follow the link for more Information on Dolphin TherapyWhat Does it Take to Achieve Certification? AquaCranial Therapist Certification requires a total of 350 hours of treatment(s), which includes Basic and Advanced courses, and specialty training in Bimini, Bahamas and Tonga, Oceania to experience giving deep water treatments alongside wild dolphins and whales.  We desire to become committed specialists in our field.There are currently only a handful of Certified AquaCranial Therapists worldwide. Unfortunately costs deter many students from pursing certification although there is a strong desire. We are confident that launching this campaign will provide a successful model to share with others down the line to fund their certification. AQUACRANIAL THERAPY FOUNDER REBECCA GOFF ~ HER STORY:Rebecca treating a client off Maui (Lana'i island in the background)Rebecca Goff, our teacher and the creator of AquaCranial therapy, began performing Occupational Therapy on patients with cerebral palsy in swimming pools in the 1970's and today is a pioneer in Cetacean Therapy Research and one of of the most experienced people today in the field of Aquatic Biomagnetic Healing.

All we need is 650 people to open our inaugural Healing Center for human trafficking survivors aged 12-24 next September 2015!
One of the organizations we provide this facility for, FREE OF CHARGE, is GEMS Girls, the leading service provider for the survivors of human trafficking in the United States.   

Financially Strong:  We are debt free & proactively funded through social enterprise.  
Ready to Grow: We are two-thirds there already!  With 270 developed acres already paid for in full, basic renovations are the last step to open our doors and get results immediately!


Visionary Results-Driven Leadership: Proactive leadership team and a stellar advisory board. 

Exclusive Use:  The motivation is love.  There is no other purpose.  The purpose of the retreat is to facilitate powerful humanitarian work.  Nothing more. 

Perks: Through our partnership with our social enterprise, the Home CEO Academy, we are able to gift you access to a comprehensive 30-Day Total Life makeover program.   







What We Need & What You Get We need just 650 people to open our retreat! 
$200,000 will complete the renovations our Phase One 6,000 square foot dorm, dining and meeting facility to house up to 15 attendees and staff for small group healing retreats.
This includes the tangible costs of surveying, civil engineering, blueprints, installment of a geothermal heating and cooling system, dorm furnishings & bedding, widening of hiking trails, maintenance improvements to the horse stable, and remaining construction budget.
The Founders of the retreat have already acquired the land (valued at over $700K) and are funding over half of the renovation construction ourselves but we need your help for the last bit.  
Construction crews are scheduled next May, June and July in faith - our first inaugural healing retreat is next September 2015!


Donors will receive the following (select perks):

Access to a 30-Day Total Life Makeover program, called the Home CEO Academy and the award-winning book The Home CEO's Guide to Life, winner of the Living Now Book Awards silver medal for outstanding nonfiction.







  The Impact We work exclusively with the best led, best visioned humanitarian organizations with a proven track record of success - we simply catapult them even further.   Our primary recipient is GEMS-Girls, which provides educational and mentoring services to over 350 survivors of human trafficking aged 12-24 and policy and human services training for over 100 organizations, shelters and police departments.  
  



Risks & Challenges The risks of construction projects include weather constraints during winter months, availability and timing of contractors, and unforeseen costs.  However, we are working with an award winning, incredibly talented Amish builder (Sylvan Stolzfus Construction) that is known for the steadfastness, exceptional quality and decades of experience.  Additionally, our architect (Alison Spear, Arquitectonica) is very experienced and is recognized as a leader in her industry.  With the exceptional quality of the construction leadership team, our project will go as smoothly as one possibly could and any hurdles during build will be handled through creative solutions and redesign as needed.

<h2>THE PASSION STORY</h2>
<p>Sara is a longtime practitioner of Ashtanga Yoga and started <a href=""http://&lt;www.joyismyarmor.com&gt;"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joy Is My Armor</a> to create a space for her local community to practice. Joy Is My Armor also serves as a platform for raising funds for charities she's passionate about. The charity she’s supporting currently is the <a href=""https://www.wildbirdfund.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wild Bird Fund</a> on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She's already made a 2017 donation to the fund out of her own pocket. Why? Because she wanted to be an ornithologist when she was little and loves birds!</p>
<h3>About </h3>
<p>Sara has been practicing yoga for most of her life. She started with Hatha Yoga as a kid under the guidance of her father, who also taught her Yoga Nidra. She did competitive horse riding and bicycle racing for years and rediscovered yoga after college. She began Ashtanga in 2001 and has been a dedicated practitioner since. She studies under a KPJAYI authorized teacher, Karri Jinkins, as well as at Pure Yoga West under Scott Harig, and has completed RYT-200 hours of Ashtanga primary and intermediate series training at Pure Yoga. </p>
<h3>Why Now and What Next</h3>
<p>Tired of commuting 45 minutes to NYC to practice Ashtanga, Sara took a leap of faith and opened her own studio in a local shared movement space. But with very little capital, she needs to kickstart it so that she can meet her charitable contribution goals of donating profits to charity, currently the Wild Bird Fund. With any donations she receives, she'll continue to support her current class offerings and bring in guest teachers to build the Ashtanga community in Hoboken. Eventually, she’d love to secure her own yoga studio and likes the idea of renting it as a community space in off hours. If we meet our goal, or meet our goal halfway, we'll donate 6 month or 3 months of membership fees to the Wild Bird Fund. </p>
<h3>What’s Ashtanga Yoga?</h3>
<p>Ashtanga is unique because students memorize a set sequence of postures in an open studio format where they receive one-on-one instruction from a teacher. This is way of learning is called Mysore-style, and it allows the student to work at their own pace, gradually building stamina, concentration, flexibility and endurance. Students are also asked to take a class led by a teacher once a week to stay on point with their personal practice. Ashtanga is taught in a very specific order, starting with the Primary Series, followed by the Intermediate and Advanced A (the Third Series).</p>
<p>Once a student becomes accustomed to the Mysore-style way of learning, they’re able to develop a home practice, begin to excel in many postures that had formerly been elusive and some even experience personal transformation. </p>
<p>Ashtanga is meant to be integrated into your regular life, so we practice early in the morning before work and other commitments. The community is so important because we encourage and support each other. It’s the energy and dedication of others and our teachers that motivates us. </p>
<h3>Why Birds?</h3>
<p>Fun fact: Sara grew up on a farm and raised all sorts of birds — pigeons, doves, chickens, ducks, geese, quail and finches. She wanted to be an ornithologist but ended up working in advertising instead. But she never lost her love of birds and still owns one small finch, though is focusing her energy on supporting wild birds.</p>
<p>Recently she met the Wild Bird Fund on the Upper West Side, NYC, and in lieu of donating her time, which is challenging with her yoga and full-time work schedule, she decided to donate JoyIMA profits to them. </p>
<p>The Wild Bird Fund supports wild, urban birds in the New York City area. They care for and rehabilitate, then return birds to the wild. You can read more about <a href=""http://&lt;https://www.wildbirdfund.org&gt;"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the organization here</a>.</p>
<p>Sara is also passionate about other causes, but she’s kicking this off by supporting her all-time favorite creatures. Stay tuned for other efforts!</p>
<h2>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<h3>Breaking It Down</h3>
<p>We're looking for $9,265 to fund the yoga studio space for 6 consecutive months. This goes to rent the space ($7,500), pay operational costs including marketing materials ($200), guest teachers ($800) and transactional fees from Stripe &amp; IndieGoGo ($765). If we can meet this goal, we'll donate membership fees from drop-ins, monthly fees or class packs to the Wild Bird Fund (up to $1,500). If we meet this goal halfway, then we'll consider the studio funded for 3 months and donate up to $750 to the Wild Bird Fund.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a small contribution, we’ll give you free classes and some complimentary swag including totes, T-shirts and coffee (because we get up so darn early!). </li>
<li>If we don’t reach our goal completely or halfway, the funds will be dispersed evenly over the next year to help maintain the studio with any donations made on a discretionary basis.</li>
<li>If we exceed our goal, we’ll donate more to the Wild Bird Fund and will update you with how much additional.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Sara is a dedicated practitioner of Ashtanga and has been for almost 17 years. She’s thrilled to bring this to Hoboken, but there are realities of high rent and the slow progress of attracting more Ashtanga students. She has a full-time job too, which does takes time away from JoyIMA. The challenges she faces are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing to fund the studio, which is currently being done on primarily a personal basis.</li>
<li>Maintaining healthy growth through marketing efforts by adding more students.</li>
<li>Thwarting the capitalist tendency to turn every business venture into a way to make profits. This why giving back to the Wild Bird Fund is so important.</li>
<li>Doing good for the community by keeping the Ashtanga space a positive place to be by focusing on the well-being of her students and the charities JoyIMA supports.</li>
</ul>

I know this because I spent years doing the opposite—being social instead of soulful, isolating myself so people wouldn’t see my vulnerability and sickness. I retreated inward instead of asking for support until, one moment, <strong>something woke me up.</strong></p><p>For most of my life I’ve suffered from dis-ease. From as far back as I can remember, I’ve bounced from doctor to doctor trying to discover the root of the problem. At the age of eight I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease and since that time my body has never felt at ease. My symptoms have come and gone over the years, worsening over time into something that doctors struggle to diagnose. Along with recurring Lyme, I’ve been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and myofascial pain disorder, but overall doctors say they can’t pinpoint why I’m unwell. It’s a mystery, they tell me.</p><p><strong>What isn’t a mystery</strong> however is this: Chronic dis-ease has led me into a vicious cycle of isolation and loneliness.</p><p>It was during a Positive Psychology training program that someone said, <strong>“micro-moments of love contribute to our well-being”.</strong> In other words, connection doesn’t just feel good, it can change our bodies. This idea was revolutionary to me. As I began studying the science behind that quote, I learned how relationships and micro-moments can literally change our bodies—it spikes our DHEA levels, lowers cortisol, boosts our immune system, and increases longevity. Soon I began to realize that, by isolating myself and disengaging with life, I had aided in my own illness.</p><p> </p><h3><strong><i>In that moment, an idea was born: the Connection Cure.</i></strong></h3><p> </p><h2><strong>What is the Connection Cure Tour?</strong></h2><p><strong>4 years, 50 states</strong></p><p>The Connection Cure is a cross-country human engagement project that explores face-to-face connection as a catalyst for healing and wellness, and it aims to answer these questions:</p><p><strong>One: If more people learn about how engagement changes our bodies, and begin to connect more—with friends, family, and total strangers—can we help heal ourselves and start to heal our country?</strong></p><p><strong>Two: As an experiment, can I help heal my own body by engaging in micro-moments of connection and deeper engagement with life?</strong></p><p>Over the next <strong>four years,</strong> I hope to visit <strong>every state</strong> in the country, offering <strong>workshops</strong> <strong>about the science and practice of connection</strong>. The workshops are part discussion and part interactive activity, where we deepen our ability to listen and relate, learn the science behind the healing process, and create belonging with ourselves and one another.</p><p>On the personal side, I’m working with an internist and infectious disease specialist at Mt. Sinai Hospital to measure the impact of this experience on my body—she’ll regularly <strong>measure my blood levels</strong> of oxytocin, DHEA, cortisol, vasopressin, and gonadotropin to see if or how this engagement changes my body.</p><p>Finally, the Connection Cure tour practices what it preaches. Along the road, I will be <strong>engaging with strangers while listening and sharing their stories of connection,</strong> <strong>community, and belonging</strong> over various social media and blog platforms. This is not just my story, it’s everyone’s story. It’s about finding similarities and inspiration in places that might surprise us.</p><p>The Connection Cure is a <strong>social experiment </strong>and a way to bring more tools of connection to people in an increasingly disconnected world. To do this, I am drawing on 15 years of study and experience in the US and abroad, working with non-profits and NGOs, youth, and women; and I've done HIV/AIDS mitigation, community work, coaching and storytelling workshops. I've also studied mind body medicine, positive psychology and nonfiction writing. I've synthesized all of these pieces of my journey into a series of offerings that I hope will inspire people to step outside of their comfort zones, befriend each other, listen more deeply, and share their gifts. This project is an action step to bring tools of engagement out into the world, to challenge people, share stories, and highlight the positive connections that we make everyday. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518487345/gwsoha9pke2a93cyskkd.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Uber Pool micro-moment with strangers, San Francisco</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Why the Connection Cure Tour? And why now?</strong></h2><p>We’ve never needed connection more than we do right now. <strong>Our country is polarized and disconnected,</strong> which breeds misunderstanding, isolation, fear, even hatred. This disconnect is also making us sick, literally—over <strong>60 million Americans feel so isolated that their health is damaged in ways that mirror the effects of high blood pressure, smoking and obesity.</strong></p><p>We all get lonely and we all feel disconnected at times. But admitting this can feel taboo. I’m on a mission to kill that taboo, to <strong>talk openly about loneliness</strong> and disconnect, and to help others do the same—because connection is healing. When we engage, when we listen and tell our stories, we gift that person an immunity boost, quite literally.</p><p> </p><h2>
<strong>What happens on the road?</strong><br/> </h2><h3><u>Connection Cure Workshops</u></h3><p>I will be offering Connection Cure workshops in as many locations as possible in each state, including free workshops for local non-profits when we adapt the activities for different populations. The workshops will be offered in different locations; for example, living rooms, schools, offices, community centers, churches, synagogues, yoga studios, and libraries. By offering these workshops in different settings, we hope to discover the common threads that bring us together. </p><p>At these workshops, we’ll create a <strong>safe space to have discussions around loneliness and vulnerability, evolution and the body, and the courageous art of listening.</strong> We’ll talk about the science of connection. We’ll share our own stories about moments of engagement, and we’ll be challenged to step outside of our comfort zones, engaging more with ourselves, others, and the world. As we do, I hope we can spark a <strong>revolution of connection.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518667490/ehlrauhjc7t69c6t3iwx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>New Vista Ranch, Nevada – Non-profit for intellectually and developmentally disabled adults</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518667147/acb3ebqvgvlmqcg3ucth.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Beverly Hills, California</p><p> </p><h3><u>Connection Cure Conversations</u></h3><p>Storytelling and story-sharing are a big part of the Connection Cure tour.

I know this because I spent years doing the opposite—being social instead of soulful, isolating myself so people wouldn’t see my vulnerability and sickness. I retreated inward instead of asking for support until, one moment, something woke me up.For most of my life I’ve suffered from dis-ease. From as far back as I can remember, I’ve bounced from doctor to doctor trying to discover the root of the problem. At the age of eight I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease and since that time my body has never felt at ease. My symptoms have come and gone over the years, worsening over time into something that doctors struggle to diagnose. Along with recurring Lyme, I’ve been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and myofascial pain disorder, but overall doctors say they can’t pinpoint why I’m unwell. It’s a mystery, they tell me.What isn’t a mystery however is this: Chronic dis-ease has led me into a vicious cycle of isolation and loneliness.It was during a Positive Psychology training program that someone said, “micro-moments of love contribute to our well-being”. In other words, connection doesn’t just feel good, it can change our bodies. This idea was revolutionary to me. As I began studying the science behind that quote, I learned how relationships and micro-moments can literally change our bodies—it spikes our DHEA levels, lowers cortisol, boosts our immune system, and increases longevity. Soon I began to realize that, by isolating myself and disengaging with life, I had aided in my own illness. In that moment, an idea was born: the Connection Cure. What is the Connection Cure Tour?4 years, 50 statesThe Connection Cure is a cross-country human engagement project that explores face-to-face connection as a catalyst for healing and wellness, and it aims to answer these questions:One: If more people learn about how engagement changes our bodies, and begin to connect more—with friends, family, and total strangers—can we help heal ourselves and start to heal our country?Two: As an experiment, can I help heal my own body by engaging in micro-moments of connection and deeper engagement with life?Over the next four years, I hope to visit every state in the country, offering workshops about the science and practice of connection. The workshops are part discussion and part interactive activity, where we deepen our ability to listen and relate, learn the science behind the healing process, and create belonging with ourselves and one another.On the personal side, I’m working with an internist and infectious disease specialist at Mt. Sinai Hospital to measure the impact of this experience on my body—she’ll regularly measure my blood levels of oxytocin, DHEA, cortisol, vasopressin, and gonadotropin to see if or how this engagement changes my body.Finally, the Connection Cure tour practices what it preaches. Along the road, I will be engaging with strangers while listening and sharing their stories of connection, community, and belonging over various social media and blog platforms. This is not just my story, it’s everyone’s story. It’s about finding similarities and inspiration in places that might surprise us.The Connection Cure is a social experiment and a way to bring more tools of connection to people in an increasingly disconnected world. To do this, I am drawing on 15 years of study and experience in the US and abroad, working with non-profits and NGOs, youth, and women; and I've done HIV/AIDS mitigation, community work, coaching and storytelling workshops. I've also studied mind body medicine, positive psychology and nonfiction writing. I've synthesized all of these pieces of my journey into a series of offerings that I hope will inspire people to step outside of their comfort zones, befriend each other, listen more deeply, and share their gifts. This project is an action step to bring tools of engagement out into the world, to challenge people, share stories, and highlight the positive connections that we make everyday. Uber Pool micro-moment with strangers, San Francisco Why the Connection Cure Tour? And why now?We’ve never needed connection more than we do right now. Our country is polarized and disconnected, which breeds misunderstanding, isolation, fear, even hatred. This disconnect is also making us sick, literally—over 60 million Americans feel so isolated that their health is damaged in ways that mirror the effects of high blood pressure, smoking and obesity.We all get lonely and we all feel disconnected at times. But admitting this can feel taboo. I’m on a mission to kill that taboo, to talk openly about loneliness and disconnect, and to help others do the same—because connection is healing. When we engage, when we listen and tell our stories, we gift that person an immunity boost, quite literally. 
What happens on the road? Connection Cure WorkshopsI will be offering Connection Cure workshops in as many locations as possible in each state, including free workshops for local non-profits when we adapt the activities for different populations. The workshops will be offered in different locations; for example, living rooms, schools, offices, community centers, churches, synagogues, yoga studios, and libraries. By offering these workshops in different settings, we hope to discover the common threads that bring us together. At these workshops, we’ll create a safe space to have discussions around loneliness and vulnerability, evolution and the body, and the courageous art of listening. We’ll talk about the science of connection. We’ll share our own stories about moments of engagement, and we’ll be challenged to step outside of our comfort zones, engaging more with ourselves, others, and the world. As we do, I hope we can spark a revolution of connection.New Vista Ranch, Nevada – Non-profit for intellectually and developmentally disabled adultsBeverly Hills, California Connection Cure ConversationsStorytelling and story-sharing are a big part of the Connection Cure tour. On the road, I stay open to meeting fascinating people and taking the time to listen to their stories of connection and disconnection, of belonging and community. These stories will be shared over social media and written blog format as I travel–– with the hope of one day becoming a book.South Pass, Wyoming Micro-Moment Brooklyn, NY Micro-Moment  How can you become part of the Connection Cure? DonateThis is a lofty goal, and over the last year I’ve invested my own money, traveled to five states, and hosted 18 free workshops. I've stayed with strangers, reconnected with people from my past, and made new community along the way. All of me believes in this project, so before asking for support, I wanted to invest my time, energy, money, fear and excitement into it. I now believe in it even more. But, I also know I can’t do this alone. Four years visiting every state in America will take time and money. So I’m hoping that—if the idea gives you hope and gets you excited—you’ll invest to help make this project happen, in whatever way you can. Host a workshopYou can also support the tour by hosting a workshop! Or hosting me on your floor, your couch, or air mattress.

<p>Like the rest of the world, all of us here at Pin-Ups On Tour have had to adapt to this ""new normal."" Our solution? Virtual Hospital Visits! With the help of the staff at the facilities, we found a way to use various streaming platforms so we can stream a show and and then chat with veterans one on one to give them a new face to talk to without leaving the safety of our homes. While it may not be the ideal, live hugs can wait as long we can still help the veterans smile.</p>

<h3><strong>My story</strong></h3>
<p>I love to study the Bible, however I would find it difficult to understand at times and would find myself rereading verses and some times whole chapters. I would get lost in who was speaking. The meaning of words like ""thee, thou and thy"" would change from referring to one person to referring to someone completely different which can be confusing.</p>
<div>
<p>So Nine years ago I started highlighting the Bible and assigning colors to everyone who speaks. It's been a long process but the result is a beautiful book that is a complete joy to read.  It is important to me to be able to share this joy with others and help others read and understand Christ better and easier.                         </p>
<p>So I started this campagin here to help fund the printing and sharing of the ""Bible of Many Colors"" This is a great opportunity to be a part of this amazing project, please share this with your friends and family. Everyone who actually holds this book in their hands will love it!</p>

I knew one day that I would meet the Grandmother with whom I was always having spirit conversations in dream-time. The day finally came when I met Grandmother Nakai Breen (Rose of the River), a Cherokee medicine woman in Texas. I spent 20 years with her, learning how to remember the things I already knew and receiving new teachings. When we first met, she asked me, “Where have you been for so long? It took you long enough to get here!”</p><p>Grandmother Nakai Breen walked as a “Beloved Woman of the People.” She taught me to search and practice the gifts that I was born with and use today at The Rose and The Swan Healing Center to help “Heal the Healers” – the manifestation of a vision I saw in my dreams. The vision Grandmother Nakai and I had led to building the Healing Center we have today located on the Bear Camp River in West Ossipee, New Hampshire.</p><p>The Rose and The Swan is operated by donation only. No one would ever be turned away. As a Universal Healer, I hold a Medicine Hoop of Life Ceremony twice a year at The Rose and The Swan that was passed on from Grandmother Nakai. This is held the first Saturday of every June and October. My husband of 47 years and I, along with my two helpers, also conduct sweat lodges, pipe ceremonies, and the teach traditional beadwork.</p><p>Grandmother Nakai also introduced me to the The Crystal Earth Project – a project of helping to plant Crystal Earth Seeds. I have blessed and planted a Crystal Earth Seed in Texas in honor of Grandmother Nakai, blessed the planting of the “Onondaga Peacemaker” Crystal Earth Seed in Syracuse, N.Y. in the Spring of 2016, and planted a Crystal Earth Seed in ceremony at the Medicine Hoop of Life that I keep. This technology directly engages the energies of Mother Earth, through the use of special crystals, for the purpose of healing and enlightening the human physiology.</p><p>In addition to The Rose and The Swan Healing Center, I currently work with gifted children and adults with brain trauma. At The Rose and The Swan, I also do individual and group counseling. I travel across the United States and Canada to share the Teachings, conduct Sacred Ceremonies and assist with healing when asked.</p><p>I am a lifelong lover of the earth and its people.

Her knowledge has been handed down to her by several Maori Tohungas [Shamans] and acknowledged elders of her tribe. Moetu has spiritual access to information that only a few people can access. Growing up with her special gifts and being taught the art of healing through love since childhood Moetu has traveled the world for 16 years. Moetu’s professional portfolio holds a wealth of knowledge and her specialty in working with cellular system. This method helps to transform trauma by identifying and releasing memories and scar tissue and replacing them with new patterns that empower.

Moetu’s expertise is providing Transformational Workshops that provide a framework for inner exploration and empowerment by bridging the gap between spirituality, rationality, and emotions. The workshops are carefully tailored and delivered to assist people from all walks of life in conscious co-creators in all aspects of their existence, whether personal or professional. Moetu’s focus has been around MANA-WA-ORA translated means Heart Power = Light Dimension = Wholistic Radiance. Our bodies are mirrors of our inter- personal – our Spiritual, Mental, Physical, Emotional and Etheric, also our Professional, Sexual, Creative, Financial and Environmental Health.

As a seer, she has the ability to see other realms of color, light, and sound. In addition, she has the ability to see the effects of existing imbalances on the physical, emotional and spiritual realms within a person’s energy system. She was born in highlands of Central America, specifically Nicaragua and was the youngest of 15 children. In the Mayan astrology she has the seed sign.</p><p>As a world traveler she has offered ceremonies and has spoken on a wide range of topics from healing with the use of herbs to her more recent project, The Seed Temple, located in Estancia, New Mexico. Flordemayo® travels the globe to share her healings, prayers, and to foster a more spiritual understanding among humanity. She is a founding member of the the Confederation of Indigenous Elders of the America (1995 – 2000), Institute of Natural and Traditional Knowledge (2003 – 2007), Church of the Spiritual Path (1998, 2008 – 2014), and the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers (2004 – 2014).</p><p>In addition, she is the founder and member of The Path. Born under the sign of Q’anil (seed), Flordemayo® sees her role as cosmic germinator through teaching, community, manifestation and development. In recent years, she began to explore in-depth the wisdom of the seeds. As a caretaker of seeds, she prays for their well-being and survival.</p><p>In 2012, Flordemayo® received a vision during dialogue with the Beloved Mother. In this vision, Flordemayo® finds herself sitting in a rocking chair, rocking back and forth while being lovingly guided to prepare seed bundles with prayer. The Beloved Mother had shown a cosmic inspiration for Flordemayo® to birth, The Path, an organization dedicated to the conservation and preservation of heirloom and heritage seeds. Now, The Path, prepares seed bundles to be given to the parents of babies being born today and those to be born in the future in the dream of honoring and protecting light beings of all forms in this new era of the Divine Feminine.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE PATH</strong></p><p><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></p><p>The mission of The Path is to conserve and distribute seeds for future generations. We meet our mission through seed conservation, education, and collaboration with other organizations.</p><p><strong>OUR VISION</strong></p><p>Is to raise spiritual consciousness on the inter-connectiveness between humanity and Mother Earth.</p><p>The Path is housed on a 40-acre piece of property in Estancia, New Mexico, just east of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Estancia is translated as the “place of rest.” On the 40-Acres are Flordemayo’s five sacred temples for humanity: The Temple of the Golden Child, The Water Temple, The Fire Temple, The Seed Temple, and The Earth Temple.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Message from Greg Schoen -  Seed Keeper at The Path</strong></p><p>The Seed Temple is the realization of Grandmother Flordemayo's original vision of a place where the sacred heritage seeds would be protected for future generations.  It has existed since 2012 on 40 acres near Estancia, New Mexico and has served as a source of seed for the local area, such as the Estancia Seed Library, as well as for many individuals in New Mexico and elsewhere.   The many gatherings on the site have involved educational classes, sharing of seeds, and celebration of the spirituality carried in the seeds.</p><p>Now more than ever it is important that we protect and increase our heritage seeds for the future and for our communities.  Much of the diversity of seeds is being lost as fewer people are planting the original seeds, as modern agriculture has turned to genetically modified and patented seed to produce our crops.</p><p>The seeds in our collection have come from numerous donations of samples of traditional varieties of corn, beans, squash, grains, vegetables, and herbs.   The Seed Temple is designed as a controlled environment that protects the viability of the seeds stored.  From the Seed Temple, many kinds of seeds from our collection have been sent to volunteers who have helped grow and increase them, to keep them strong and to provide a stock source to distribute to others.  Working to preserve these seeds gives us a sense of purpose and unity and fosters the relationships in community which are our true wealth.  </p><p>The Seed Temple networks with other organizations such as the Rocky Mountain Seed Alliance and with seed preservation groups and individuals in the Southwest and beyond.   It holds a special place in the future of the worldwide movement to preserve our sacred seeds.</p><p>~Greg Schoen~</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521809167/dtrlwg5abbhryxrw481a.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>MASTER MINGTONG</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521687254/bip78jski5vuwqnlmdna.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Mingtong Gu is an internationally recognized teacher and healer who received his training from a variety of Grandmasters in China and at the world’s largest Qigong hospital. This “medicine-less” hospital, Zhineng Qigong Center, has treated over 200,000 patients, with over 185 different illnesses, and with a 95% effective improvement rate. He is the founder of The Chi Center and Wisdom Healing Foundation and has taught Qigong to thousands of people in the USA, China, and Europe.</p><p>As a child growing up in China during the Cultural Revolution, Master Gu learned much patience and endurance. The youngest of 7 children, he was adopted by a new family, then returned to his birth family at age 7. His family often went without food for days. Despite such hardships, his mother was determined by any possible means to support his dream of education. He became the first from his village to attend college. </p><p>He earned his BA in Math from Hangzhou University and an MA in Math from University of California at San Diego. He continued his training at Brandeis and Harvard University until deciding to pursue an artist’s career. He earned an MFA from Ohio State University and taught at Columbus College of Art and Design.</p><p>As a graduate student in Art, Master Gu discovered the treasures of his own culture through the spiritual iconography of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Western mystic traditions. He also practiced Yoga, Tantric Buddhism, and Qigong. In 1997 he returned to China for Qigong training under Dr. Pang Ming, a Qigong Grandmaster trained in western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Dr. Pang synthesizes his profound medical knowledge of the old and new healing sciences into the ancient qigong practice and presents this integrative system of self-healing and cultivation for the present pragmatic world. In the 1980s, he founded the world’s largest medicine-less hospital known as “Huaxia Zhineng Qigong Training and Recovery Center”. Through enormous scientific research (3000 research papers were published during the 90’s), and more than 20 years of experimenting with Qigong healing, Wisdom Healing Qigong has developed into a scientific system of working with energy to improve life, including healing.</p><p>Master Gu observed thousands of cases of chronic and “incurable” diseases being healed at the Zhineng Medicineless Hospital. Witnessing these profound healing experiences inspired his dedication to the teaching and practice of Qigong healing. </p><p>Through this practice, he recovered from his own chronic conditions of asthma, scoliosis, back pain and kidney weakness. And in working with his students he found his life passion, purpose, and fulfillment in this union of spiritual practice and applied healing wisdom.</p><p>He lives and teaches with his wife Linling who is also a gifted teacher and healer, and their two children whom they call their “grandmasters.” In 2008 he and his family moved to the San Francisco Bay area. And in 2016 they relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico to open The Center for Wisdom Healing Qigong.</p><p>Since his return from China, Master Gu has trained and helped thousands of students through the Wisdom Healing Qigong™ program. His teaching and healing energy have attracted hundreds to his online courses, weekend workshops, and weekly classes—including programs at Spirit Rock Meditation Center, California Institute of Integral Studies, Esalen Institute, Omega Institute and many other places around the world.</p><p>Master Gu offers a 28-day intensive healing retreat especially applicable for advanced stages of illness which is modeled after a similar program in the “medicine-less” Qigong hospital in China. His personal healing journey, along with the quality of his joyful loving nature, depth, and healing gifts, have inspired many in the healthcare and spiritual communities.</p><p>Master Gu’s teaching emphasizes activating the power of inner self-healing which facilitates the release of chronic illness while improving health and well-being. Deep awakening and transformation typically arise in this process of healing. Wisdom Healing™ Qigong integrates many forms of traditional Qigong with Eastern and Western medicine. It is a concentrated and powerful system engaging all levels of physical, mental, emotional, and soulful healing.</p><p>Through posture, movement, breath and mental concentration, Qigong offers a methodology to rediscover the inner medicine – chi, the vital and healing resource within us – and to magnify the exchange between ourselves and nature, enabling us to fuse with the infinite creative power of the universe that ultimately is the origin of love, compassion, and the source of all healing.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>MATTHEW REIFSLAGER</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521687419/f52hqvgw2cawzuqnidjz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Matthew is a spiritual healer and teacher.

Through engaging with vocal traditions re-rooted in their original sacred context, an ancient knowing rises in us and we reawaken to our basic indigenousness, as sons &amp; daughters of Earth. This opens a vast network of relationship, close kinship with fellow men &amp; women, with the elements, with animals, plants, minerals, and more; friendships that are playful and tender as well as fundamentally binding, true to the interplay of energies that activates and sustains all earthly life. Particularly in the environmental imperative of this age, if we orient our hearts toward a perspective and practice of praise of the earthly, our hands can become aligned with and ready for the necessary work on behalf of the great ongoing ecology.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>GATHERING HOSTS</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Grandmother Flordemayo and The Path</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Master Mingtong Gu and the Chi Center</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Matthew Reifslager and The Wholeness Crystal Earth Project</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Madi Sato &amp; Timothy McLaughlin and Praising Earth</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HONORED GUESTS</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Unci Rita Long Visitor Holy Dance – Oglala Lakota</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Grandmother Pershile (Perci) – Hopi/Tewa</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Grandmother SaSa – Abenaki/Dawn land people</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Grandmother Moetu Taiha – Maori Tuhoe Elder</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Reverand Grandmother Eila Paul – Maori Tainue Elder</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>MUSICAL GUESTS</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Joanne and Leah Shenandoah</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Mz. Imani</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Geri Littlejohn</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Rick ‘Thunder’ Bastine – Music as Medicine</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Walking Star – Music as Medicine</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> </strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521689498/vnyi5uyjspsx11ldshzo.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521689579/apiaswzjgfd7omtzyuka.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>","WHAT’S THE PURPOSE OF OUR FUNDRAISER?It is to lovingly bring the wise indigenous Grandmothers from around the globe to participate in the Gathering for Humanity in Santa Fe, NM and share their wisdom with humanity.

If we lose one or the other we are no longer who we say we are.”Unci means Grandmother in Lakota. Unci Rita Long Visitor Holy Dance is Oglala Lakota and was born in the southwestern corner of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota. She still lives on the land that was allotted to her great grandparents over 100 years ago. Unci Rita cherishes and advocates her traditional Lakota ways and language, which she speaks fluently. Unci Rita is empathetic to single parents and their struggles to raise their children, because she too raised her children (and five of her oldest grandchildren) on her own.Unci Rita is skilled in survival and holds the knowledge of how to dry food and make clothing, both traditional Lakota style and contemporary. Today Unci Rita is a grandmother, great grandmother and great-great grandmother. Unci Rita feels that being part of the grandmothers’ council feels like family, like blood relation, like the other grandmothers feel like her sisters. Unci Rita said the most important job the grandmothers’ council has is to keep all the people in a straight line, “no matter what denomination or color they are”.Grandmother Pershile (Perci) – Hopi/TewaI a member of the Hopi/Tewa Tribe, from the Village of Walpi, AZ. I am a Grandmother who is dedicated to healing hearts, minds and spirits of those that are experiencing pain,educating those who are eager to learn, guiding those who have taken the wrong road, reminding those who forgot the message. I am a wisdom gatherer and a protector of ancient wisdom. I stand in support of all Grandmothers from a variety of ethnicities and religious traditions.As a Hopi Elder, I believe in the Hopi prophecy, “When the Grandmothers speak, the world will began to heal.” I am creating awareness to heal the isolation and separation between people of all nations by sharing my beliefs, stories and history. I go where I am called and rely on the generosity of people to support my work. My most recent work has been with: Patina Wellness Center, Pasqual Yaqui Youth Group, Unity Community Church, Phoenix Indian Center, Native American Urban Ministry, and the Partnership with Native Americans. Most of my personal work has been with community members who are suffering a life threatening and life altering events. Helping and assisting people to deal with pain. Grandmother SaSa – Abenaki/Dawn land peopleI was born in Central Maine to a father of Abenaki/Scottish/Irish descent and a Japanese mother.While growing up, I realized the gifts that I was born with were to be a seer, a dreamer and a hands-on healer. I knew one day that I would meet the Grandmother with whom I was always having spirit conversations in dream-time. The day finally came when I met Grandmother Nakai Breen (Rose of the River), a Cherokee medicine woman in Texas. I spent 20 years with her, learning how to remember the things I already knew and receiving new teachings. When we first met, she asked me, “Where have you been for so long? It took you long enough to get here!”Grandmother Nakai Breen walked as a “Beloved Woman of the People.” She taught me to search and practice the gifts that I was born with and use today at The Rose and The Swan Healing Center to help “Heal the Healers” – the manifestation of a vision I saw in my dreams. The vision Grandmother Nakai and I had led to building the Healing Center we have today located on the Bear Camp River in West Ossipee, New Hampshire.The Rose and The Swan is operated by donation only. No one would ever be turned away. As a Universal Healer, I hold a Medicine Hoop of Life Ceremony twice a year at The Rose and The Swan that was passed on from Grandmother Nakai. This is held the first Saturday of every June and October. My husband of 47 years and I, along with my two helpers, also conduct sweat lodges, pipe ceremonies, and the teach traditional beadwork.Grandmother Nakai also introduced me to the The Crystal Earth Project – a project of helping to plant Crystal Earth Seeds. I have blessed and planted a Crystal Earth Seed in Texas in honor of Grandmother Nakai, blessed the planting of the “Onondaga Peacemaker” Crystal Earth Seed in Syracuse, N.Y. in the Spring of 2016, and planted a Crystal Earth Seed in ceremony at the Medicine Hoop of Life that I keep. This technology directly engages the energies of Mother Earth, through the use of special crystals, for the purpose of healing and enlightening the human physiology.In addition to The Rose and The Swan Healing Center, I currently work with gifted children and adults with brain trauma. At The Rose and The Swan, I also do individual and group counseling. I travel across the United States and Canada to share the Teachings, conduct Sacred Ceremonies and assist with healing when asked.I am a lifelong lover of the earth and its people. My husband Terry and I are blessed with two daughters and four grandchildren. Terry and I have been married for 47 years. Before opening The Rose and The Swan, I formerly served as a National Accredited Flower Show judge and worked as head designer for a major Southern florist for many years. I also served as volunteer for Hospice. Grandmother Moetu Taiha – Maori Tuhoe ElderMoetu-Taiha is descended from Ngai Tauhoe and the Kahungunu Tribes of Aoteara, New Zealand.

As a seer, she has the ability to see other realms of color, light, and sound. In addition, she has the ability to see the effects of existing imbalances on the physical, emotional and spiritual realms within a person’s energy system. She was born in highlands of Central America, specifically Nicaragua and was the youngest of 15 children. In the Mayan astrology she has the seed sign.As a world traveler she has offered ceremonies and has spoken on a wide range of topics from healing with the use of herbs to her more recent project, The Seed Temple, located in Estancia, New Mexico. Flordemayo® travels the globe to share her healings, prayers, and to foster a more spiritual understanding among humanity. She is a founding member of the the Confederation of Indigenous Elders of the America (1995 – 2000), Institute of Natural and Traditional Knowledge (2003 – 2007), Church of the Spiritual Path (1998, 2008 – 2014), and the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers (2004 – 2014).In addition, she is the founder and member of The Path. Born under the sign of Q’anil (seed), Flordemayo® sees her role as cosmic germinator through teaching, community, manifestation and development. In recent years, she began to explore in-depth the wisdom of the seeds. As a caretaker of seeds, she prays for their well-being and survival.In 2012, Flordemayo® received a vision during dialogue with the Beloved Mother. In this vision, Flordemayo® finds herself sitting in a rocking chair, rocking back and forth while being lovingly guided to prepare seed bundles with prayer. The Beloved Mother had shown a cosmic inspiration for Flordemayo® to birth, The Path, an organization dedicated to the conservation and preservation of heirloom and heritage seeds. Now, The Path, prepares seed bundles to be given to the parents of babies being born today and those to be born in the future in the dream of honoring and protecting light beings of all forms in this new era of the Divine Feminine.THE PATHOUR MISSIONThe mission of The Path is to conserve and distribute seeds for future generations. We meet our mission through seed conservation, education, and collaboration with other organizations.OUR VISIONIs to raise spiritual consciousness on the inter-connectiveness between humanity and Mother Earth.The Path is housed on a 40-acre piece of property in Estancia, New Mexico, just east of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Estancia is translated as the “place of rest.” On the 40-Acres are Flordemayo’s five sacred temples for humanity: The Temple of the Golden Child, The Water Temple, The Fire Temple, The Seed Temple, and The Earth Temple.Message from Greg Schoen -  Seed Keeper at The PathThe Seed Temple is the realization of Grandmother Flordemayo's original vision of a place where the sacred heritage seeds would be protected for future generations.  It has existed since 2012 on 40 acres near Estancia, New Mexico and has served as a source of seed for the local area, such as the Estancia Seed Library, as well as for many individuals in New Mexico and elsewhere.   The many gatherings on the site have involved educational classes, sharing of seeds, and celebration of the spirituality carried in the seeds.Now more than ever it is important that we protect and increase our heritage seeds for the future and for our communities.  Much of the diversity of seeds is being lost as fewer people are planting the original seeds, as modern agriculture has turned to genetically modified and patented seed to produce our crops.The seeds in our collection have come from numerous donations of samples of traditional varieties of corn, beans, squash, grains, vegetables, and herbs.   The Seed Temple is designed as a controlled environment that protects the viability of the seeds stored.  From the Seed Temple, many kinds of seeds from our collection have been sent to volunteers who have helped grow and increase them, to keep them strong and to provide a stock source to distribute to others.  Working to preserve these seeds gives us a sense of purpose and unity and fosters the relationships in community which are our true wealth.  The Seed Temple networks with other organizations such as the Rocky Mountain Seed Alliance and with seed preservation groups and individuals in the Southwest and beyond.   It holds a special place in the future of the worldwide movement to preserve our sacred seeds.~Greg Schoen~MASTER MINGTONGMingtong Gu is an internationally recognized teacher and healer who received his training from a variety of Grandmasters in China and at the world’s largest Qigong hospital. This “medicine-less” hospital, Zhineng Qigong Center, has treated over 200,000 patients, with over 185 different illnesses, and with a 95% effective improvement rate. He is the founder of The Chi Center and Wisdom Healing Foundation and has taught Qigong to thousands of people in the USA, China, and Europe.As a child growing up in China during the Cultural Revolution, Master Gu learned much patience and endurance. The youngest of 7 children, he was adopted by a new family, then returned to his birth family at age 7. His family often went without food for days. Despite such hardships, his mother was determined by any possible means to support his dream of education. He became the first from his village to attend college. He earned his BA in Math from Hangzhou University and an MA in Math from University of California at San Diego. He continued his training at Brandeis and Harvard University until deciding to pursue an artist’s career. He earned an MFA from Ohio State University and taught at Columbus College of Art and Design.As a graduate student in Art, Master Gu discovered the treasures of his own culture through the spiritual iconography of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Western mystic traditions. He also practiced Yoga, Tantric Buddhism, and Qigong. In 1997 he returned to China for Qigong training under Dr. Pang Ming, a Qigong Grandmaster trained in western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. Dr. Pang synthesizes his profound medical knowledge of the old and new healing sciences into the ancient qigong practice and presents this integrative system of self-healing and cultivation for the present pragmatic world. In the 1980s, he founded the world’s largest medicine-less hospital known as “Huaxia Zhineng Qigong Training and Recovery Center”. Through enormous scientific research (3000 research papers were published during the 90’s), and more than 20 years of experimenting with Qigong healing, Wisdom Healing Qigong has developed into a scientific system of working with energy to improve life, including healing.Master Gu observed thousands of cases of chronic and “incurable” diseases being healed at the Zhineng Medicineless Hospital. Witnessing these profound healing experiences inspired his dedication to the teaching and practice of Qigong healing. Through this practice, he recovered from his own chronic conditions of asthma, scoliosis, back pain and kidney weakness. And in working with his students he found his life passion, purpose, and fulfillment in this union of spiritual practice and applied healing wisdom.He lives and teaches with his wife Linling who is also a gifted teacher and healer, and their two children whom they call their “grandmasters.” In 2008 he and his family moved to the San Francisco Bay area. And in 2016 they relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico to open The Center for Wisdom Healing Qigong.Since his return from China, Master Gu has trained and helped thousands of students through the Wisdom Healing Qigong™ program. His teaching and healing energy have attracted hundreds to his online courses, weekend workshops, and weekly classes—including programs at Spirit Rock Meditation Center, California Institute of Integral Studies, Esalen Institute, Omega Institute and many other places around the world.Master Gu offers a 28-day intensive healing retreat especially applicable for advanced stages of illness which is modeled after a similar program in the “medicine-less” Qigong hospital in China. His personal healing journey, along with the quality of his joyful loving nature, depth, and healing gifts, have inspired many in the healthcare and spiritual communities.Master Gu’s teaching emphasizes activating the power of inner self-healing which facilitates the release of chronic illness while improving health and well-being. Deep awakening and transformation typically arise in this process of healing. Wisdom Healing™ Qigong integrates many forms of traditional Qigong with Eastern and Western medicine. It is a concentrated and powerful system engaging all levels of physical, mental, emotional, and soulful healing.Through posture, movement, breath and mental concentration, Qigong offers a methodology to rediscover the inner medicine – chi, the vital and healing resource within us – and to magnify the exchange between ourselves and nature, enabling us to fuse with the infinite creative power of the universe that ultimately is the origin of love, compassion, and the source of all healing. MATTHEW REIFSLAGERMatthew is a spiritual healer and teacher.

It is the most sublime and powerful employment of our voice as it gathers up and then offers out all our joy, all our longing, even all our grief. As deep, richly-formed praise, our expressions become like food gifted to Earth Mother in reciprocity for her constant nourishment of us. Through engaging with vocal traditions re-rooted in their original sacred context, an ancient knowing rises in us and we reawaken to our basic indigenousness, as sons & daughters of Earth. This opens a vast network of relationship, close kinship with fellow men & women, with the elements, with animals, plants, minerals, and more; friendships that are playful and tender as well as fundamentally binding, true to the interplay of energies that activates and sustains all earthly life. Particularly in the environmental imperative of this age, if we orient our hearts toward a perspective and practice of praise of the earthly, our hands can become aligned with and ready for the necessary work on behalf of the great ongoing ecology.GATHERING HOSTSGrandmother Flordemayo and The PathMaster Mingtong Gu and the Chi CenterMatthew Reifslager and The Wholeness Crystal Earth ProjectMadi Sato & Timothy McLaughlin and Praising EarthHONORED GUESTSUnci Rita Long Visitor Holy Dance – Oglala LakotaGrandmother Pershile (Perci) – Hopi/TewaGrandmother SaSa – Abenaki/Dawn land peopleGrandmother Moetu Taiha – Maori Tuhoe ElderReverand Grandmother Eila Paul – Maori Tainue ElderMUSICAL GUESTSJoanne and Leah ShenandoahMz. ImaniGeri LittlejohnRick ‘Thunder’ Bastine – Music as MedicineWalking Star – Music as Medicine",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

and to do so at a very affordable rate. The only obstacle for me in making this
happen is the initial purchase expenses. That is why I am asking for your
support through this campaign.

<p>With the Spirit Box, I envision setting up presentations for non-profit
events as well as offering individual healing sessions incorporating my work
with Inceptional Soul Services. In particular I wish to work with and support:</p>
<p>- those who have disconnected from authentic power</p>
<p>- those facing death either through the normal
aging process or through terminal illness who have fears and unanswered
questions about the soul journey</p>
<p>- those who are grieving for loved ones</p>
<p>- those who have been traumatized in some way as to
have blocked their ability to express the truth of their soul essence.</p><b>Here's a little bit of history to help you
understand this goal:</b>
<p>For the past decade or more, I have been strongly guided by a
vision for developing a space that sets the stage for humanity to develop
a greater conscious awareness of our inter-relation with ourselves and our
planet. Over the years, this vision has been somewhat like a kaleidoscope,
various aspects of it transforming in response to deeper wisdom and awareness.
At the heart of this vision, however, is the constant flame of Spirit urging me
deeper into the unifying consciousness that we are all Divine Essence and that
the true healing path is towards remembering that Divine Spark.</p>
<p><i>...Imagine a space that is a coming together of the
Story Tellers, the Gate Keepers, the Light Workers, and all those
teachers/ students (a.k.a every human being) who have been building the
foundations of a better world for humanity.  It is a coming together for
one purpose, to amplify and resonate in the healing power of the heartspace of
humanity, coupled with the heartspace of mother earth and anchored in the
heartspace of the cosmos. It is a true expression of the fullness of who we are
as humans, allowing the expression of our souls through the harmonious energies
of the universe and infinite pool of Spirit.</i></p>

such a way as to offer a tangeible visual experience for everyone to witness
the power of this energetic healing, even if they are not good at meditating or
visualizing. The Spirit Box supercedes the ego perceptions and allows the
participant to enter into a space of complete openness and readiness to make
the necessary connections for deep transformation and healing.</p><b>Other ways you can help:

<br/></div>","Who I am:
I am the founder and facilitator of Inceptional Soul Services, an
independent energy healing and spiritual counseling service that assists
individuals to become empowered as agents of change in their own journey of
health and well-being. www.inceptionalsoul.com 
What I am seeking and Why:
I am seeking to raise $4500 to purchase a Spirit Box so that I can make
this healing tool available to anyone in Lindsay and the City of Kawartha Lakes
who has the desire to connect with their Essential Self and realize their brilliance
as a Divine Spark of cosmic intelligence. 
Breakdown of cost: Individually crafted Spirit Box $3300, video
projector required for the audio/visual aspects costs approx. $500, and then approx.
$400 for shipping costs). Additional funds will cover the added costs of taxes
and misc. expenses.The Spirit Box is a living art form; a leap forward in multi-dimensional
quantum healing that utilizes light, sound, color, and the representation of
the Divine Feminine (Kwan Yin) to connect deeply with the individual psyche to
bring healing and integration of body, mind, and soul. The actual Spirit Box is 5ft to 6ft tall by 30 inches wide and 3 inches 
deep. When clients stand before it, they are immersed in the vibrational
 healing of light, sound, and essence.Created by Andre Ferrella, the Spirit Box serves as a portal for the
intelligence of the cosmos to be expressed in such a way as to reach the
individual receiving the experience before them. Even those who are wary of
such healing or who struggle with connecting with meditative processes will
achieve a healing result from the experience of The Spirit Box.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spdxj5XN_0oMy goal is to make such healing accessible to the general population,
and to do so at a very affordable rate. The only obstacle for me in making this
happen is the initial purchase expenses. That is why I am asking for your
support through this campaign.

With the Spirit Box, I envision setting up presentations for non-profit
events as well as offering individual healing sessions incorporating my work
with Inceptional Soul Services. In particular I wish to work with and support:
- those who have disconnected from authentic power
- those facing death either through the normal
aging process or through terminal illness who have fears and unanswered
questions about the soul journey
- those who are grieving for loved ones
- those who have been traumatized in some way as to
have blocked their ability to express the truth of their soul essence.Here's a little bit of history to help you
understand this goal:
For the past decade or more, I have been strongly guided by a
vision for developing a space that sets the stage for humanity to develop
a greater conscious awareness of our inter-relation with ourselves and our
planet. Over the years, this vision has been somewhat like a kaleidoscope,
various aspects of it transforming in response to deeper wisdom and awareness.
At the heart of this vision, however, is the constant flame of Spirit urging me
deeper into the unifying consciousness that we are all Divine Essence and that
the true healing path is towards remembering that Divine Spark.
...Imagine a space that is a coming together of the
Story Tellers, the Gate Keepers, the Light Workers, and all those
teachers/ students (a.k.a every human being) who have been building the
foundations of a better world for humanity.  It is a coming together for
one purpose, to amplify and resonate in the healing power of the heartspace of
humanity, coupled with the heartspace of mother earth and anchored in the
heartspace of the cosmos. It is a true expression of the fullness of who we are
as humans, allowing the expression of our souls through the harmonious energies
of the universe and infinite pool of Spirit.
It now occurs to me that the vision isn't so much about a physical place
to be created but rather a 'space' of awareness within every individual to
remember who we really are as Divine Sparks of universal oneness and
multi-dimensional light.
