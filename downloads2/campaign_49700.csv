The class of 2015 USED to have good heads on their shoulders!



One week prior to their high school graduation, a group of students are given the task of decorating the school gymnasium for the upcoming ceremony.

<h3>The Impact - Our Heroes Journey</h3> <p>The film is currently titled <b>'ARJUNA'</b>. In brief Arjuna is led through a battle of 18 days, by his mentor Lord Krishna.

The Bhagavad Gita is one of the most ancient and sacred texts on earth, and is more elegant in its messages today than ever before. It is the story of Arjuna, the first reluctant hero, and his journey of inspiration that is relevant to leaders and individuals the world over. This is why we making this film and calling it 'ARJUNA'
  In an age of so much confusion and white noise this film will inspire heroes, in suburbia, business, and communities around the world to stand up and make our world a better place. It inspires US... and we are sure it will inspire YOU.
We wish to bring these beautiful stories and teachings to the West, where they will be seen and contemplated by an entirely new audience. Your contribution will not just make a movie,
It will forge a statement of hope to the world. It will save animals,
the environment and motivate people to contribute to education and assistance
to emerging economies.  It will
inspire a movement effecting more change than you will ever believe. to contribute to education and assistance
to emerging economies.  
Here is a sample of the types of issues the film will Illuminate in a stunning modern treatment of age old sacred issues: 



Reincarnation, 
To fight for what you believe in or to give in, 
Your Life's Purpose, 
The role of Family, 
The 4 paths of devotion that we each choose, 

The role of mentors in our lives and how they shape our destiny and much much more


  How do we know we can make this happen? We have done it before. In 2010 we released our first film, Dreamcatchers (See IMDB) with 29 cities involved in a global launch. 
That film had 1/10th the budget of ARJUNA, yet it inspired tens of thousands, started a movement and drive of social entrepreneurs and is now part of the first role out of an inspirational channel to over 500,000,000 homes and portable devices globally.

The Impact - Our Heroes Journey The film is currently titled 'ARJUNA'. In brief Arjuna is led through a battle of 18 days, by his mentor Lord Krishna. His enemies are members of his family, his childhood friends and other people of high esteem. He doesn't  want to fight them, yet Krishna counsels him that he is born to do what is right and in this case it means fight almost everyone that he has ever loved. 
We are bringing this story to screen for the first time with a western film crew. Why... Because it's time for the reluctant heroes in our community to stand up for the environment, for our children, for the world and what is right. Every single human was born a hero, and yet most of us have been told to stay quiet, in our place, while the rich get richer and more powerful.

The Bhagavad Gita has romance, action, drama and humour and it touches on some of the greatest lessons in life. These are not for us to judge yet simply to make the viewer aware of these questions: is there an afterlife? Does having purpose to life matter? What would you do to stand up for what you believe in? These are the types of questions the viewers will consider when viewing this film.

We will make a film that you will be proud of: Drama, action, love, stunningly shot with an awesome sound track,
 
We have done it before with Dreamcatchers. 
Five years later it is still being shown around the world.
We
are attracting a stellar team, with years of award winning experince and will
be adding more exciting roles shortly. 
Maybe you even know someone who would love to join us.    Risks & Challenges  Let's be honest. This is a film... 90% of them never get made. But why... because they are being made with only a commercial purpose and nothing more. This film is different and it will be made regardless of what we raise here or in other more traditional circles. Watch the video and listen to Helena Spring. This
is a woman who does what she says she will do.
  

When
we made Dreamcatchers, CrowdFunding did not exist.  We had no seed capital to begin - but out network and
believers did.  This movie went
around the world. 
Just
imagine - when we make this film over 1 billion people in India will be be keen
to see our version of what they know so well.
 

If we don’t reach our target here, we
will use all our available equity to reach the next stage which is
institutional funding. 

With
more than 30,000 people in our own networks we have a considerable spread.  Once we get our seed capital coming in
the many communities who are interested will be invited to join.  This includes those in the film arena
of Bollywood as well as our world wide Dreamcatchers Fan Community. And we have
already made many connections in the New Zealand, Bollywood and South African film industry who are interested
to come on board.

The Impact


 Honestly, this film is so close to home for our team because we all understand what it's like to not know who we are. Teenage identity is something that gets glossed over and is not taken very seriously. We want that to change with this film. It goes beyond being gay or straight; it's about being true to yourself, which is something everyone can relate to. 
    Risks & Challenges Because this film is very low maintenance (three locations, no special effects/over the top make up or costumes, limited props/set dressing, no one getting paid), our main challenge has to do with getting the funding for equipment, which bears the brunt of being the most costly thing we have to acquire. We want to make this film look as professional and cinematic as possible, and the only way to do that is to use top-of-the-line equipment. We need this look because we want our film to stand-out as not only a great story, but a great Film. While we have connections with equipment houses, the rising costs of renting cameras, lenses, lighting fixtures, generators, etc, means that we know where we have to put most of the money.

</div>","How You Can Be A Force For Good And Impact Millions Of Children... Right Now And Going Forward.



Love. Unconditional love.
We showed up at the orphanages around the world to offer help, and what we got was unconditional love from the kids we were there to help.
This movie is to tell their stories - not ours.
It's a movie about transformation -theirs and ours.
And it's a movie about what's possible when a small group of people come together with a common vision based on lifting each other up, so we can turn and lift 1000 more.
Now is the time.






Here's What You Need To Know About This Project:



You can channel your desire to impact the world at a higher level and become part of our global  ""force for good.""  We created this project so we can ""own"" 100 orphanages around the world, and teach the children (and teachers) the type of things we've learned from our teachers like Tony Robbins and Anandagiri.

We will go to the orphanages in person and give kids and teachers transformational experiences and resources that they would never get without our help.

We're going to document on video what we teach the kids and turn it into a full-length documentary movie that we will distribute internationally. 



We will deliver the movie online to kids and administrators in orphanages around the world.  If kids don't have internet access we will provide them with iPads already loaded with the movie and other resources.



We will create a mobile app/game based on the real-life stories from the movie.  We will embed scenes from the movie in the mobile app.  We are going to gamify personal growth and happiness so that just playing the game will increase the kids' awareness of stories and facts, and prepare them for life after they leave the orphanages at the age of 18.








What You Get



You get to choose your level of leadership.  This isn't for everybody.  However, if you feel like being part of this is going to serve you, serve others, and serve the greater good, then you're in the right place!





You get to help create the project from the ground up in a way that's most meaningful to you.  Pick a country.  ""Claim"" an orphanage in that country.  It's yours.  Adopt the kids there.  Teach the teachers.  You could be featured in the movie.




Enjoy your ""perks"" and bring along your family and friends to give them the experience of a lifetime.  I've visited lots of orphanages in my lifetime.  So have my kids.  I've brought people to the orphanages so they can experience it.  There's nothing like it.  Look at the photos.  Bringing somebody along for this experience may be the best gift you could possibly give somebody.


(IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY LIKE A COACH OR A SENIOR TRAINER, YOU COULD BE A FEATURED ""STAR"" IN THE MOVIE.)






   The Impact
Instead of just teaching kids core Tony ""stuff"" or Ananda ""stuff"" we're going to capture the transformations on videos and then make the video available to orphanages and schools around the world as a movie.
We will also distribute the movie as a documentary that will be critically acclaimed, and may even win awards, like an Oscar.  That's one of the fun goals. :)
Why it's a must to do this:  
The kids need this.  They have very few role models or teachers to help them with this. 
The teachers need this.  They will learn things from us that will help them impact the kids for as long as they're teachers. 
Nobody else can do this.  We've seen what happens.  Well-meaning ""social"" tourists visit orphanages and provide gifts and sympathy.  We're not going in to provide sympathy.  Compassion, yes.  Then we're going to teach them.  

We've already done it.  It works.  The kids learn, and then immediately teach the younger kids.  We've done it in orphanages around the world already.

We are uniquely positioned to make this huge.  We've already established relationships, like with the Archbishop of Kenya.  We're already a ""force for good.""  We just need a small group of leaders and a plan.  Then we implement.  Done!

We have been blessed by being taught by Tony and Ananda.  They've lifted us up so we can turn and lift up others.  It's who we are, and what we do.

DISCLAIMER: Risks and Challenges For This Project
The biggest risk is looking back in five years and wondering what ""could have been"" if we had just decided to take action and make this real.
We're going to make this happen.  To NOT do this would be totally incongruent with who we are, and what we believe in.
The other risk is physical danger.  
We've visited some places that were very in very dangerous areas, and that were attacked by terrorists, like the mall in Nairobi.  The biggest risk is we might die.  
The good news is we've created a ""rule"" for this contingency.  
It's called the ""don't waste the blood"" rule.  If there's blood, we'll get it on video and use it for good somehow.  This is a movie.  The show must go on, right? :)
Plus, we're not doing this for us.  We're doing it for the kids.



This movie is about the kids ^ not about us.  Just making that clear. :)




It Gets Better... You Can Also Win Some Cool Prizes Just For Telling People About This Project

Our goal is to build a force for good.  It's not about making a movie, it's about making a difference.
And the way to make the biggest impact is to get the most people involved.
That's why we used Indiegogo.   Indiegogo has a great built-in referral contest platform.  This means once you join our team, even for $1, you get a personal referral link.
Use your link to tell other people about this project.  We're going to announce a contest and the prizes once we reach 60% of our goal.  
We also have ""perks"" you can claim right now.  The best perk, in my opinion, is claiming ""ownership"" of one of the 100 orphanages right now.  What this means is you will be the coordinator for what our ""force for good"" does at the orphanage, and adopt the place as your own.  
We will also be adding some additional cool new perks as the campaign progresses.  Maybe something like skydiving over Turkey with us, or spending a week in New Zealand where they shot Lord of the Rings, or a private event for your friends in India with Anandagiri.
Whether you join for $1, or $500, you'll be notified when the new perks are added!

The Top Four Reasons To Join Our ""Force For Good""

Here are what might be the best four reasons to join our ""movement"":
A. It's the right thing to do. We've been blessed with so much. Let's give back to the kids who, through no fault of their own, have nothing. Not even parents or a family. We can be their family.
B. It's going to be the most fun you've ever had. I like to have fun.  Going to the orphanages is the most fun I've ever had.  We've been doing this for years. It's selfish for us to NOT share these experiences with as many people as possible.

D.  It is written.  The universe presents us with opportunities.  How we respond is what creates our destiny.  If you're reading this right now it's probably not an accident.  Maybe it's exactly what you've been waiting for.




What To Do Now 
 
I'm not going to hype up all the benefits you'll get, or why this is special.  
If you're still reading this right now and you don't feel like this is something you want to be part of, then it's probably not your thing.  I drive by homeless guys asking for money every day.  
Nobody's going to die if you don't decide to support this project.  
What I will say is if you don't choose to be part of this today you might have more to lose than anybody else.   You'll be missing out on being part of a truly incredible journey together with an amazing group of people.
That's not hype or a cheap marketing ploy.  It's the truth. I've never known anybody that's been part of helping the kids in the orphanages come out wishing they hadn't done it. :)
So if you're reading this right now, thinking about whether or not to contribute, you know that helping kids in orphanages around the world is the type of thing our ""force for good"" does.
That's why we created this project exactly for you.

P.S. Everything we're doing with the kids is designed to be a ""self-assembling"" system so that when we impact anybody, or any organization, the system is set up to automatically ""pay it forward.""

What if you thought there was a way you could still save her?

What is Soul Descends? 
Soul Descends is a short film about the nature of immortality and how we are remembered after we die. When crime scene reporter, David Chandler, is called to the Empire State Building, he sees Evelyn McHale’s body in what will later be known as “The Most Famous Suicide.” However, this isn’t the first time David has seen Evelyn.
David is a voyeur, watching the characters he creates and seeing if they satiate his conscience's desire for rationality in an irrational world.
Think the silent tour de force of Drive coupled with the surreal emotional odyssey of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

</div></div>","Intro  Howdy! We are the team behind the new short film, ""La Douleur Exquise"". We are Thomas Miller (The Director), Andy Li (The Writer), and J. F. Carlson (The Cinematographer). No, we're not a Hollywood studio, we're just a couple of college kids from Boone, North Carolina who love telling great stories through film, and hope to continue to do so throughout our lives.  We have been making films for a collective 12 years.
 This is the first film we have produced with an estimated budget so big that we can't cover it on our own. With gear rentals, craft services, location costs, and film festival entry fees, we have run our resources dry.  Having to stop doing what you love because you don't have enough money is one of the most frustrating things ever.   Even through working part-time jobs, previous film gigs, and local business donations, we can't raise our budget needs.
   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  For a 14-Day shoot, we need $730 for the Canon C100 mkII, $520 for a 24-70mm Lens with an anamorphic adapter, $200 for a SmallHD monitor, $90 for a ND Filter set, $220 for a mounted slider, and $90 for a set of two 256 gb SD cards to store our footage on. Patron Level ($75) - If you donate over $75, then we will get you a digital copy of the film at least one week early!  
Investor Level ($150) - If you donate over $150, then you will get a digital copy of the Behind-The-Scenes from production to  If we don't reach our entire goal, we will have to bail on a few scenes, and cut down a few film festival entries, but we will push on!  Just because your plan doesn't go as planned, doesn't mean you can't do something great!     The Impact  Recently, the state of North Carolina lost our tax incentives of the film industry.  This pushed most of the film business out of North Carolina and back to the oppressive Southern California or Georgia. The Director (Thomas Miller) and the DoP (J.F. Carlson) both have strong filmmaking track records on their own, but this is their second project working together. The last one, Punchline, was flipped with Carlson as the Director and Miller as the Cinematographer. With casting already done, and production starting by the 8th of July, the clock is ticking as we get ready for our biggest project yet in the independent film industry.    Time  Other than funding, our biggest risk is time.  With the Cinematographer gone until July 3rd on a filming gig up in New York City, and the Director having a job at a local stage theatre for their upcoming show run on the 18th, we have to make sure that we get our vision on-camera the first time around.

<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p>The Cruelty Of Beauty is a short film which looks at the ways in which society glamourises and demonises models. The story follows a young up and coming model, Sarah, as she is beginning to gain some notoriety. This works both for and against her, as she has to deal with her jealous boyfriend who becomes increasingly more upset about the attention she receives, as well as the judgements of strangers both in person and online. She struggles to find a day job due to 'professionals' being unable to view her as a human being and not just an image. Sarah finds some relief however in the form of her flatmate Jamie; a free-spirited girl who dislikes society's view on the human body despite her own insecurities. </p>
<p>The 20-minute film is written and directed by myself, Simon Fox of Dragonstone Pictures, My first short film 'Perspective' has since been shown at Film Festivals worldwide and has been praised by critics. Star of Perspective Sarah-Louise Cairney will be producing, having recently produced the short film 'Us, Alone' by Bass Rock Films.</p></span>Everyone sees an image, but they rarely know what life is like beyond that picture. Models bare more than just their bodies for the camera, and often are criticised, taunted and attacked verbally and, sometimes, physically. Knowing models through work and friendship, I was horrified to hear their stories of encounters they've faced with people online and in person, it seemed ridiculous that people could create such hatred, and at times obsession towards a perfect stranger, someone that they have never met nor likely ever will, simply due to the way they looked. On the internet, anonymity provides courage to a lot of people to be as harsh and disgusting as they like towards others, but sadly that behaviour isn't restricted to just online. In person these models have to deal with taunts in the street, people actually coming up to them and being abusive to their face, and worst of all some models have had their families and friends turn on them for their career choice.<br/>It seems incredible then, that we as a society beg for these people to display themselves for our enjoyment, only to be tortured for it.<br/><br/>With this film we want to give viewers an insight into the personal lives of models, to show that they are actual human beings, with insecurities, loves and distinct personalities. They are friends, siblings, offspring and parents. They are not just a picture. <br/><br/>By contributing to our short film, you will be helping to create an important and entertaining story, and you will be helping to send out a positive message to challenge society's judgements. <br/><br/><p></p>

</div><div>Filmmaking isn't cheap, you'd be amazed at the ways in which all the little costs can mount up, and how much some things can cost! That's why we really need your help. Funding towards filmmaking in Scotland is painfully weak, and so we have to look to funding bodies outwith the country which unfortunately means that applications to those organisations will increase exponentially. </div><div>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>While we'd love to be able to pay everyone involved a full time wage,
that's just unrealistic, therefore everyone involved understands that the film
comes first and as long as we can make sure that the cast and crew aren't out
of pocket then they're happy. To do that we need to keep them fed, watered and
cover all travel expenses. We also have to pay for equipment hire, make-up and other
product used, location hire and props, and insurance! It's always better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it. We don't want to accidentally break someone's wall or leg, but if we do, then we need to be sure that we're insured for it. Getting cover for a short production is still expensive, with ours being quoted at just under £85.<br/><br/>
That's just during production of course, once the film is complete we need to
show it off, and film festivals aren't cheap! You're talking anywhere between
£5 and £50 per festival. We really want to make sure this film looks as good as
possible, and in order to gain recognition within the industry in which we all
aspire to enter, award ceremonies like the BAFTA Scotland New Talent Awards are
a must, which is £30 per category for entry. <br/>
But we're not just asking for you to give us money, we're offering up some
fantastic perks for you! As the film revolves around modelling, all of our
perks are themed along with the story, therefore we're offering photoshoots by
our film's writer/director Simon Fox who is also a very accomplished
photographer, check out some examples of his work below:<br/><br/></p>

<br/>So if you're working on your modelling portfolio, or just want to do one for fun, this is a fantastic opportunity. We also understand how expensive it can be for actors and actresses to have their photos taken for headshots, and that's why we have the Headshot perk which offers 6 photos (3 colour, 3 black and white) at very good price, so you're not only helping us out, you're also helping your own career!<br/><br/>As with most film festivals, the film can't have been publicly screened before entry, therefore for those who want to help and also want to see where their money has gone, we are offering perks such as Closed Set in which you will get a password protected link to watch the finished film up to a year before the general public. <br/><br/>Every little helps, and even donating £5 can go a long way towards creating this film, so we'll give you a big thank you to everyone who supports the project.  <br/>

<div>The impact is this: we are experienced filmmakers and students working equally, side-by-side. Our young filmmakers learn skills they only talk about in the classroom. They learn how to interact with other professionals on set. They discover what is required to put together a feature-length film. They learn how to work with talent, how to be helpful to others, and how to work fast and make something of quality.</div>

<p>My first feature was released in November 2014 - less than 1 year ago. It earned half its budget back in the first two months of release on PPV Cable, All streaming media, and BluRay/DVD. It had NO name stars. Two months ago the distributor was prepping the film for release in 20 foreign markets. I've been told that is a huge success in today's marketplace. I'm hoping it helps convince you to donate to this project</p>
<p>For the past dozen years Del has been teaching filmmaking and screenwriting and passing on what he learned from his early career in Hollywood. He started out as an intern working for tv writers who created shows like The Rockford Files and Charlie’s Angels, then worked in film production for a dozen years before working at Disney Studios and Lucasfilm. His first feature, ""<a href=""http://braindamagefilms.com/dvd/horror/anthology/dead-girls/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Dead Girls</span></a>,"" was produced for $25,000 and recouped half its budget within the first two months of release, even though it had no recognizable name actors. Originally released in North America in November 2014, the film is being readied by the distributor for release in foreign markets, which is a rare accomplishment for such a low budget feature. </p>

</div></div>","DON'T SAVE ME is the story of Jessie, who discovers she is destined to become leader of her estranged father's clan of vampires. It's a contemporary vampire tale about a young woman who is finally united with the father  she has never known only to discover what fate has in store for her is much different from the dull, average life she expected. 






DON'T SAVE ME is a film about family, blood, betrayal and destiny.


 

We are very fortunate to have so many talented artists and students dedicated to the project. Making a feature film, even a micro-budget feature, requires funding.
Our goal of $50,000 will provide the necessary funds to make this film. Here is a detailed list of what your donations will help pay for:


Transportation, food, location and other costs to get cast and crew to and from set
Props, special effects, contact lenses and handmade dental fangs for our vampires
Costumes and production design
Camera gear, lenses, lighting, and more
Music rights and fees
Paying our talented lead actors
Paying crew members, the creative team, and other professionals
Legal fees
Insurance for talent, locations, equipment, production
Promotional and marketing costs



Besides the knowledge that you have helped every person involved in this film succeed in a cinematic adventure, you get the perks listed in the boxes at right. 



If we do not reach our goal, we will continue to raise funds through fund raising events and more crowd funding. No matter what, we are determined to make this film.



Whatever amount you choose to show your support, you will have the gratitude of everyone involved. 
 

The impact is this: we are experienced filmmakers and students working equally, side-by-side. Our young filmmakers learn skills they only talk about in the classroom. They learn how to interact with other professionals on set. They discover what is required to put together a feature-length film. They learn how to work with talent, how to be helpful to others, and how to work fast and make something of quality.

</div><p></p></div>","Dolores is a horror/comedy short film that was selected as one of the thesis films for the Film Production M.F.A program at Full Sail University.  
What is Dolores about? 
After killing his victims in that same night, a Butcher, who hates Halloween, must endure an elevator ride with strangers who think he’s wearing a costume.
We have come a long way to get here, a journey full of effort and commitment, but at the same time a lot of sacrifices, leaving our home countries, our families, and risking everything to achieve our dreams.  

This film is a very important step in that journey. We know we can have a high quality product to proudly represent Full Sail University at film festivals around the world, thus boosting our careers as filmmakers. We need your help to make it happen. 

Who are we? 






Federico Carmona Astor: Producer
Federico is a film producer from Caracas, Venezuela. He has a Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Mass Communication from Universidad Monteávila (Caracas). His career started in advertising, but he would later find out that his true passion is in filmmaking.

Apart from that he was Film Festivals Coordinator for Papita, Mani, Tostón, the highest grossing film in the history of Venezuelan cinema. 
His passion for filmmaking, and his ambition for being the best in his work brought him to Full Sail University, and led him to be the Producer of Dolores. 


Gabo Lugo:  Writer/Director

Gabo is from Carolina, Puerto Rico. He studied Digital Production-Film in one of the best schools for film in Puerto Rico, “Universidad del Sagrado Corazón”, where he was chosen to direct a TV commercial for one of the biggest supermarket chains on the island.

Due to his success on Youtube, he became a Special Guest for a TV show based on video games for over two years, which led him to be a Special Guest for the Puerto Rico Comic Con in 2013. 
He has already written and directed three other films in Full Sail so far, but Dolores is his biggest challenge in the program. 
Federico and Gabo have already worked as Producer/Director team in two other short films.


Ricardo A. Cortez Ortiz: 1st Assistant Director
Ricardo has a bachelor's degree in Mass Media Communication from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. He worked with the Grammy Award Winner Victor Sonny Hernandez in his recording studio and was Assistant Editor to Samuel Collazo at Imagivision.

After retiring from the service he finished his B.S. in Mass Communication with a focus in Audio Production at Middle Tennessee State University. While learning the arts of foley, sound design, and scoring he caught the film bug. He then moved to Orlando, Fl to pursue  his M.F.A. in Film Production at Full Sail University. 
Steven is also a still photographer with decades of experience with 35mm and medium format cameras. He loves lighting and was the perfect fit for Director of Photography for Dolores.
What We Need
 Making a film is not easy at all, neither is it cheap. We are very lucky to have the support from Full Sail University regarding most of the equipment that we need, such as camera kit, grip/lighting, and post production facilities.  
We want to have the most professional film, therefore we will be shooting with the Sony F65 (4K),  and all our post production will be done in Avid Media Composer, color grading with Da Vinci Resolve and doing our sound mix in a Dolby Certified Dubbing Stage. For those of you that are not familiar with film, this basically means that we are going to be using Hollywood standard equipment for our project.
However, there are many other things that are needed to make a film,  and that is where we need your help, because we need funds to make it happen.
Catering/Crafting Services:  We have a very talented crew, and we want them to be happy while they work. We all know that food is one of the most important things in a film set. 
Locations/Permits:  We already have secured locations, but we need to pay a rental fee to the owner of the warehouse, and also pay for permitting in the Orlando Film Commission. 
Art Department:  The Production Design is essential in our film. Therefore, the art department takes a big part of our budget. As we mentioned we want to have the best film, and having funds is essential to buy all the necessary elements for the set dressing, wardrobe and props. 
Transportation/Parking:  We need to travel 20 miles with a crew of 30 people to our location, therefore we need to rent a van and pay for parking permits in the area. 
Additional Equipment: Although Full Sail provides us with most of the equipment. We would still need to rent a steady cam with an operator for the Sony F5. 
Film Festivals/Marketing: It is not enough to make your film, you have to be able to sell it,  or in this case to get it to film festivals.

<h3>We want to stop bullying.</h3> <p>We're a reality show asking for help to make a full season of inspiring and life-changing television.</p>
<p>Today, we feel, bullying is different than in years past.  Children come home from school only to get harassing text messages, emails, Facebook posts, etc.  There's no way to keep your child in a bubble and keep them offline.  Some stories we've found online include bullies using fake phone numbers to send hateful messages to their victims.</p>
<p>Too often the messages tell the person to kill themselves.  And we're seeing too many suicides as a result.  We want to stand up and make a difference.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions!</h1>
</div><div>
<p><b>Q:  When do I get my Perk?</b></p>
<p>A:  Each Perk has an Estimated Delivery month listed in description. You will be notified of any delays.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q: Can I upgrade to another Perk?</b></p>
<p>A: Unfortunately, Indiegogo does not have a built in function for this. However, if you do want to upgrade to a higher perk level, we recommend that you simply donate the difference between your original payment and your desired new Perk level. Be sure to contact Joshua Derby via the contact user button on his profile -so we can update your record.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q: What if I forgot to add shipping for my Canadian or International order?</b></p>
<p>A: Similar to the procedure for Perk upgrades, we recommend that you make a separate payment to account for the missing shipping charges.  Be sure to contact Joshua Derby via the contact user button on his profile so we can update your record.  For US Funders no additional amount is needed, we factored that into the base perk amount. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q: I don’t see the update on my Indiegogo contribution profile after you confirmed my upgrade?</b></p>
<p>A: Unfortunately Indiegogo doesn’t allow us to update information for you or us, we’re tracking this separately and will make sure you get your proper perks and items, thanks!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q:  How do I tell you what T-Shirt size I need?</b></p>
<p>A:  When the campaign comes to an end we will send you an email inquiring of the cut &amp; size you want that you can reply to.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q:  What are you guys going to do with all this money?</b></p>A:  There is a pie chart on the main page that illustrates where the dollars are divided into. And, each Stretch Goal past the original goal ($350,000 = Pilot) adds more episodes.</div><div>
<br/><div>
<p><b>Q: When is the premiere, I want to know if I can be there for my perk?</b></p>
<p>The premiere date is not yet set.  When we have a date we'll update it here.  Should you want to secure the perk now and cannot make the date, once announced, we can set up an alternate date for you to visit us while filming.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q: Are there any considerations I need to know about for the VIP Premiere Invite tiers?</b></p>

Frequently Asked Questions!

Q:  When do I get my Perk?
A:  Each Perk has an Estimated Delivery month listed in description. You will be notified of any delays.

Q: Can I upgrade to another Perk?
A: Unfortunately, Indiegogo does not have a built in function for this. However, if you do want to upgrade to a higher perk level, we recommend that you simply donate the difference between your original payment and your desired new Perk level. Be sure to contact Joshua Derby via the contact user button on his profile -so we can update your record.

Q: What if I forgot to add shipping for my Canadian or International order?
A: Similar to the procedure for Perk upgrades, we recommend that you make a separate payment to account for the missing shipping charges.  Be sure to contact Joshua Derby via the contact user button on his profile so we can update your record.  For US Funders no additional amount is needed, we factored that into the base perk amount. 

Q: I don’t see the update on my Indiegogo contribution profile after you confirmed my upgrade?
A: Unfortunately Indiegogo doesn’t allow us to update information for you or us, we’re tracking this separately and will make sure you get your proper perks and items, thanks!

Q:  How do I tell you what T-Shirt size I need?
A:  When the campaign comes to an end we will send you an email inquiring of the cut & size you want that you can reply to.

Q:  What are you guys going to do with all this money?A:  There is a pie chart on the main page that illustrates where the dollars are divided into. And, each Stretch Goal past the original goal ($350,000 = Pilot) adds more episodes.

Q: When is the premiere, I want to know if I can be there for my perk?
The premiere date is not yet set.  When we have a date we'll update it here.  Should you want to secure the perk now and cannot make the date, once announced, we can set up an alternate date for you to visit us while filming.

Q: Are there any considerations I need to know about for the VIP Premiere Invite tiers?
Yes, you will be invited to the premiere in Dallas, Texas.  Unless stated in your perk, airfare and hotel is not included.  The dress will be business casual.",4.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi!  My name is Kim
Gitzel.  By day, I'm a solo mom to my 6 year old daughter Grace, and a
self-employed Acupuncturist in the small town of Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii.  By night, I am a roller
derby girl known as Derbutante Diva who plays with the Paradise Roller
Girls.  Grace is my teammate in life and I aspire to find positive toys for her to play with, but that is hard to do.  I noticed something was missing when I went shopping for my
daughter. I realized there were no truly inspirational girl superhero brands out there.  So instead of agonizing on buying something  <span>I didn't like,  I had
an idea - why not create my own
superhero action brand that girls of all ages could connect with and aspire to?! Thus, The Sirenz of Truth™: The Wheeled Warriors™ was born!!</span></p>
<p>The Sirenz of Truth (SOT) is a
story about 5 roller derby highschool girls, who unbeknownst
to them through their magic<span>-infused roller skates, become Elemental Powered
Superheroes!  The girls are called upon to save the world from the
Evil Pernicious Invaders who are ready to take over planet Earth.  (To
read more about the concept/characters please go to </span><u><a href=""http://www.sirenzoftruth.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sirenzoftruth.com</a></u>)</p>
<p><span> Like all moms, I want a symbol for my daughter that represents strength, individuality, talent
beyond looks, diverse, positive body image, and teamwork.  SOT represents all that and more,; strong, empowered  athletic girls who have deep friendships, a team bond, and superpowers. This is a POWERFUL GIRLS
SUPERHERO BRAND with GIRLS AS THE LEAD CHARACTERS!!  Imagine the
possibilities!! </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Kim partnered with toy
industry vet, Caryl Liebmann, of Liebmann Licensing, to take this brand to the
world.  “I met Kim and got that
feeling in the pit of my stomach that told me Sirenz of Truth (SOT) was a
winner.  It’s just what the
industry is missing – strong, realistic role models for girls!”  SOT has been met with great response to
the toy and entertainment industry leaders.  “We have designed SOT for an animated TV series, with
merchandise to include toys, games, electronics,apparel
and much more.”</p>
<p>YOU
can be a part of the development of <span>this incredible
Girls Superhero Brand! </span> Our vision is to see SOT as an animated tv show.  In order to do
that, we need a create a 3 minute animation clip, crucial for pitching our Superhero Story and brand to top
entertainment executives.  </p>
<p>You can choose from a variety of levels – lend your voice to
a character and create your very own roller derby name, or how about an
executive producer credit, naming a new character or help write a future
episode?  Or would you prefer to
own original, signed scripts, written by a Dreamworks scriptwriter with such
credits as How To Train Your Dragon.  This plus many more opportunities await you
through participating in the Sirenz of Truth: The Wheeled Warriors.  And don’t
forget that by contributing to this campaign,  you will become a
Wheeled Warrior yourself!! </p>
<p>There is a collective desire to see strong, adventurous alternatives to what is currently
taking place in both the toy aisle as well as on TV/Video .   This new
concept will find a place in the world because <b>now is the time to
represent strong girls, smart girls, healthy girls, cooperative girls, athletic
girls.</b>  NOW IS THE TIME!</p>

	DER CAST - DIE GESICHTER VOR DER KAMERA
    

    	THE CAST - FACES IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA
    

YASIN KAMAT (FIN)

    Yasin aus Mönchengladbach hatte für uns dieses ""gewisse Etwas"". Der Blick, den man braucht um die Rolle des Fins glaubwürdig zu verkörpern. Er brachte sich von Anfang kreativ mit ein, gab Vorschläge, um den Charakter noch lebendiger und Interessanter zu machen.
ALICE PÖPPING (LISS)

    Die Bonner Schauspielerin Alice entwickelte aus der Figurenbeschreibung der Liss eine ganz eigene Charakterbiografie, um voll und ganz in der Rolle aufzugehen. Die Chemie zwischen Alice und Yasin vor der Kamera war unbeschreiblich. Selbst unser Drehbuchautor stand beim Spielen der Dialoge mit einem Lächeln daneben.

    	ENGLISH
    
YASIN KAMAT (FIN)
    Yasin from Mönchengladbach had the “certain something” for us. The glance that you need to embody the role of Fin believably. He played a big creative part in the team right from the start and made proposals to create the character much more lively and interesting. 
ALICE PÖPPING (LISS)
    The actress from Bonn developed a whole new biography of Liss from the description of the character in order to merge completely into the role. The chemistry in front of the camera between Alice and Yasin was ineffable. Even our scenarist was watching the dialogues while acting with a big smile on his face. 


	DIE CREW - LEUTE HINTER DER KAMERA
    

    	THE CREW - PEOPLE BEHIND THE CAMERA
    

ALEXANDER LORENZ (IDEE, ERSTES DREHBUCH, PRODUZENT)
Alex ist Produzent, Sänger und hauptberuflich Webdesigner aus Magdeburg. Zusammen mit Kameramann Matthias Piekacz hat er bereits einige Musik-Videos produziert und zusammen mit Regisseur Sven Kloss den Kurzfilm RACHE NEHMEN, der im Rahmen des 99-FIRE-FILMS-AWARD produziert wurde und unter die Top 99 kam. Mit Hilfe des Startkapitals, welches er für REALITÄT angespart hat, konnten die ersten Schritte zur Produktion von REALITÄT realisiert werden.
ROBERT GRYCZKE (DREHBUCHAUTOR)
Robert ist hauptberuflicher Autor und Wahl-Magdeburger.  Er schrieb das Original-Drehbuch zu MERRY XMESS, der die Jury unter anderem bei den Filmkunsttagen überzeugte.. Roberts Interpretation von Alex' Geschichte macht REALITÄT letztendlich zu dem was es heute ist: Eine düstere Melancholie zwischen Traum und Wirklichkeit.
SVEN KLOSS (REGISSEUR)
Sven ist gelernter Fotograf und Kameramann aus Magdeburg. Svens Aussage zu Beginn der Produktion war: ""Ich machs. Aber wenn ich es mache, muss das Ding größer werden, als alles was wir je gemacht haben!"" Nachdem Sven bei dem Publikumsliebling ENTMACHTET für Kamera und Co-Regie verantwortlich zeichnete und mit RACHE NEHMEN sein Regie-Debüt ablieferte, bleibt er auch diesmal dem Genrefilm treu. Mit seiner Erfahrung im Bereich Film und seiner klaren Vorstellung von der Geschichte, verhilft Sven dem Film zu seinem ganz eigenen Look und dem Projekt zu einer klaren Richtung.
MATTHIAS PIEKACZ (KAMERA)
Matthias 'Mattse' Piekacz hat sich seine Sporen als hauptberuflicher Fotograf, Kameramann und -assistent bei unzähligenKurzfilm- und Musikvideo-Produktionen verdient. REALITÄT ist nach RACHE NEHMEN bereits die zweite Zusammenarbeit mit Alexander und Sven. Er hat da visuelle Konzept des Films mitgeprägt und weiß, dass alle Ideen und schönen Worte nichts bedeuten, wenn sie technisch nicht umsetzbar sind.

    	ENGLISH
    
ALEXANDER LORENZ (CONCEPT, FIRST DRAFT, PRODUCER)
Alex is a producer, singer and full – time Webdesigner from Magdeburg. 
He already produced several music videos together with cinematographer Matthias Piekacz and the short movie RACHE NEHMEN together with director Sven Kloss, which was produced in the context of 99 – FIRE – FILMS – AWARD and fell under the choice of the TOP 99 short movies. With the aid of the seed money which he economized for REALITÄT the first steps of the production of REALITÄT could be realized. 

ROBERT GRYCZKE (SCENARIST)
Robert is full – time author and a chosen Magdeburger citizen. He wrote the original screenplay of MERRY XMESS which convinced the jury of “Filmkunstage”. Robert’s interpretation of Alex’ story made REALITÄT to a go of what it is today: a morbid melancholy between dream and reality. 
SVEN KLOSS (DIRECTOR)
Sven is a skilled photographer and cinematographer from Magdeburg. Sven’s statement at the beginning of the production was: “I’ll do it. But when I do it the thing needs to be greater than everything we’ve done before!” Sven remained true to genre movies after he has been voted as “favorite of audience” for camera work and assisting direction with the short movie ENTMACHTET and after he has delivered his directional debut with RACHE NEHMEN. With his experience in the sector of filmmaking and his very clear notion of the story he helped the movie getting its own look and getting the project into a clear direction. 
MATTHIAS PIEKACZ (DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY)
Matthias ‘Mattse’ Piekacz earned the attention of his sponsors as full – time photographer, cinematographer and camera assistant and through his innumerable short film and music video productions. REALITÄT is his second collaboration with Alexander and Sven after RACHE NEHMEN. He embossed the visual concept of the film and knows that all ideas and nice thoughts do not matter when they are not technically convertible.  


	RISIKEN & HERAUSFORDERUNGEN
    

    	RISKS & CHALLENGES
    

Ein Film benötigt Zeit. Viel Zeit. Manchmal werden Planungen über den Haufen geworfen, weil sich der kreative Prozess keiner Zeit unterwerfen will.. Du kannst in der Vorbereitung eines Bildes stecken und plötzlich fällt allen Beteiligten auf: „Nein, geht so nicht. Wir bauen um!“ Und bei den vielen Außendrehs passiert es leider auch, dass der Wetterfrosch im Hals sitzt und Dir hämisch dazwischenquakt.
Kunst und der kreative Mehrwert von künstlerischen Werten liegt immer im Auge des Betrachters. Und ein Film, egal ob kurz oder lang, muss nicht jedem gefallen. Wenn REALITÄT uns und Dir gefällt reicht das doch vollkommen ok.
Wir hoffen auf Dein Verständnis, wenn der Fall eintritt, dass die Danksagungspakete nicht rechtzeitig bei den Unterstützern eintreffen. Da wir Deine Blu-Ray und das Plakat extern drucken lassen, haben wir auf ein, zwei Sachen leider keinen Einfluss mehr – das ist keine Entschuldigung sondern ... REALITÄT.
Wenn du jedoch mit uns in Kontakt treten möchtest, gibt es für dich die Möglichkeit eine Mail an realitaet@synapicfilms.com zu schicken. Wir freuen uns auf deine Nachricht!


    	ENGLISH
    
Creating a movie takes time. A lot of time. Sometimes plans get messed up because the creative process does not want to submit itself to the time provided. You can be in the middle of prearranging an image and all of a sudden everyone notices: “No, that doesn’t work out that way. We need to rebuild it!” And during the whole lot of shootings outside the weather can betray you not just once. 
Art and creative additional benefit of artistic worth is always in the eyes of the beholder. And a movie no matter if it is a short or long one, does not need to appeal to everybody. If REALITÄT appeals to you and to us, it will be perfectly okay. We count on your sympathy if it is the case that the packages of our expression of gratitude do not arrive in time. Due to the fact that we let your Blu – Ray and your poster be printed at external companies we do not have an influence on one or two things anymore – That is no decision but … REALITÄT (reality)

<div>
<p>Indian cinema, when talking about history, has some very common elements which have been filmed since 1913 (the starting of cinema in India). The British Empire (as in Lagaan, Mangal Pandey, Junoon, etc.), partition of India (as in Gadar, 1947 : The Earth, Sarhad Paar etc.), the Indo-Pak wars (Border, LOC Kargil, Lakshya etc.). But cinema has always neglected a very important part of Indian history. The non-British European empires in India. Apart from the British, there were Portuguese, French, Danish, Dutch and there was also a failed Austrian expedition near Calcutta as well. Talking about Portuguese Empire, there have been two films made on it backdrop, Saat Hindustani (debut of Amitabh Bacchan) and a Malayalam film, Urumi (starring Vidya Balan, Genelia D’Souza etc.) But about French and others, its totally been neglected. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This film, (I have named it as Andrews, a title I decided working on in 2009), is not exactly based on historical events. But it has Portuguese backdrop in it, mixed with a psychological drama. In 1937, Portuguese government imposed many stringent rules over the territories of Goa, Damão (Daman), Dadra, Nagar Aveli (which later combined into Dadra and Nagar Haveli) and Diu (N.B - At this time, these territories were officially part of Portuguese Empire, and not of India). These territories were collectively called as GOA. Ram Manohar Lohia, was an Indian independence activist (took part in liberation struggle against the British), but was active even in Goan struggle as well. So, in June 1946, he held a meeting with his Goan friend, Dr. Juliao Menezes. Just before the meeting (which was to carry on with Goan freedom struggle), there were riots and arrests of protestors (against Portuguese) and gatherers. Andrews, the film, is not about the historical story. Here, the film (a pure fiction) actually starts the night before the meeting took place. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Pure fictional narrative, completely being held in one room. The room is the same room where Lohia and Menezes are going to have a meeting. The meeting is to be held on 18th June 1946, and the film takes place on 17th June 1946. At night. Three unknown activists, of Portuguese decedents, originating from Goa, have killed a policeman (which would be revealed in the middle of the film), and have hidden the body in a coffin. The coffin is inside the room. Their task is to dispose the body by next morning. The leaders are going to arrive tomorrow at 4:15 PM, and they have to leave by 8:00 in the morning, to Vasco da Gama (a small town in Goa; the meeting takes place in Hotel Republica, Panjim). </p>

Indian cinema, when talking about history, has some very common elements which have been filmed since 1913 (the starting of cinema in India).

This film, (I have named it as Andrews, a title I decided working on in 2009), is not exactly based on historical events. But it has Portuguese backdrop in it, mixed with a psychological drama. In 1937, Portuguese government imposed many stringent rules over the territories of Goa, Damão (Daman), Dadra, Nagar Aveli (which later combined into Dadra and Nagar Haveli) and Diu (N.B - At this time, these territories were officially part of Portuguese Empire, and not of India).

Andrews, the film, is not about the historical story. Here, the film (a pure fiction) actually starts the night before the meeting took place. 


Pure fictional narrative, completely being held in one room. The room is the same room where Lohia and Menezes are going to have a meeting. The meeting is to be held on 18th June 1946, and the film takes place on 17th June 1946. At night.

Introducing the protagonists of the film, André, Anton and Filip. Their descriptions are briefed below :

</div></div>","Short Summary
""Most of the Time"" is a short film by writer/director Dermot Tynan, starring Larry Laverty and Kari Wishingrad. The film tells the story of Frank (Laverty), who is coming to terms with the imminent death of his wife Cassie (Wishingrad). It's about grief and loss, or love and death.
My name is Dermot Tynan and I'm a film-maker. Larry appeared in the first ever film I directed, over twenty five years ago. A Talk in the Dark played at festivals around the world, and was screened in the Ipswich Film Theatre for a week. Since that first film, Larry has gone on to make over one hundred and fifty films, while I've made a a few films myself. We always said we'd do another film together, and this is it.

This is a story I've been trying to tell for quite a while. I have kept coming back to it, trying to crack the story. It's really about two people coming to terms with an inevitable future, while glossing over their past. I was drawn to the imagery and practicality of a terminal illness. When those that are close to us are dealing with their mortality, we can bury ourselves in the minutiae. Particularly with cancer, where the technology and sheer range of drugs threatens to overwhelm us.
It was against this backdrop that I finally found the key to the story and it made sense. As Cassie wastes away before his eyes, Frank tries to immerse himself in the day to day details of her cancer treatments, while ignoring the inevitable.

I think this is a story worth telling, and one which will resonate with people. But we can't make this film without your help.

What We Need & What You Get

</b></p><p>Last year, our short film ""The Brazilian Affair"" was a huge success both from our Fundraising Campaign to the Production. This year, we are looking to raise $5000 in order to pay our Cast and Crew. This also includes Insurance, Permits, Makeup, Special 
Effects/Props, Craft Services, Location Fees, etc. We already have the 
infrastructure in place with state of the art film and editing 
technologies enabling us to keep our costs so low. The Cast and Crew are
 working on this project because we absolutely love what we do. In fact, half of the Crew from our previous short ""The Brazilian Affair"" is returning to work with us again and we couldn't be happier. This is a much bigger project with a lot of Special VFX and we think it's absolute winner.<br/></p><br/><p><b>THE CREW:</b></p>

As we are a new company, our website is currently under construction.  We have chosen to put our funds into making amazing films first.  Once ‘In Another Life’ is in the can, we will be able to shift our focus into building a website fit to display such a film.
Why does this film matter?
‘In Another Life’ is a story about first love.  That kind of love that one never forgets.  No matter what happens in our lives, we will always remember the first person who made our hearts flutter.  That one person who started it all.  
Here we follow Josh and Katie, two high school students who find themselves being pulled apart slowly by distance and time.  Will they find each other again?  Will that spark remain?  
Music of the Heart
‘In Another Life’ is a short film and will feature it’s own original soundtrack composed by Blake Bost.  
Art of the Soul
We have a wonderful artist, Jessica Carder, who will be designing original artwork for the film.  You may view her whimsical collection online at:   https://www.etsy.com/people/JCarder?ref=owner_p...
Gifts from the Heart
To thank you for your generous donations, we be giving amazing gifts.  Please see our packages on the side to choose which is best for you.  Some of the packages include gifts such as:

A limited edition coffee mug decorated with original artwork from the film
A full size movie poster signed by the cast
The full soundtrack
A limited edition production book complete with all the behind the scene goodies you could possibly dream of and signed by the crew
A DVD copy of the finished film
Producer credit
A personal invitation to the film’s screening

Where does the money go?
As a start up company, we understand the importance of money.  Every dollar counts.
Equipment - We will be renting the best cameras, lights, sound equipment, filters, dollies, and more to maximize the quality of our film. 
Crew - A lot of sweat and tears goes into making a film.  The ability to pay our crew assures the highest quality of work.  Directors, cinematographers, gaffers, boom operators, editors, productions managers, composers, and makeup artists don’t like to work for free!
Craft Services - This is a good sized cast and crew (approximately 25 people.)  We would love to eat during the shooting of our film.
Film Festivals - We plan to submit to every film festival that we are eligible for.  
Screening - This film is our heart.  Once it is complete, we will host a screening so that we may experience the fruit of our labor at it’s full glory.
What else helps?
Thank you so much for stopping by.  We appreciate your time.  If you cannot help us financially, please consider sharing our campaign with your friends and family.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello, my name is Rogelio Javier Figueroa and I'm 14 years old.  Film-making has been a interest of mine since I was 8 years old.  But it wasn't until last year when I completed my first short film (""Journey to the Fire Crystal"") that I really started getting into it.

I made this movie with a home camcorder and whatever else I could find around the house.  I filmed it out at my Grandperant's ranch with my Sisters and Grandparents acting and my Aunt filming.  My friend gave me video editing software and I taught myself how to use it.  I did all the editing and visual effects.  I wrote, composed and performed all of the music myself.  And I'm really happy with the product.  You can watch it here.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGmonzM2m0c

Seeing what I could accomplish with so little got me thinking. ""Imagine what I could do If I had better equipment, costumes, props, ect""  And It's what really gave me the confidence to do a feature film.
My campaign is to fund my first feature length film.  It's a film about magic, adventure and friendship with all sorts of mythical creatures, from mermaids and fairies to centaurs and cyclops's and everything in between.  Title to be announced.

When myself, Loa Ludwig, Emi Ludwig, Serina Figueroa and Selena Figueroa came up with the Idea to make this film we immediately started writing the script.  At the time none of us knew anything about screenwriting but we learned as we went along.  At the same time we started buying materials and making costumes.  We also had little to no experience there and we learned as we went.  Now the script and most of the costumes are done and we've started production.
We have James Hesterman who's a top photographer and Eric Ludwig who's a top videographer helping us out with video.  And we have my dad who's an expert on sound and a professional musician helping us with audio.  We've also got great actors and great people in every field.  The results we've gotten so far are nothing short of spectacular!

But we still need more equipment, costumes and props to finish our movie!  We've been getting by on borrowed equipment so far but it would be nice if we had our own.

<p>We packed up a troupe of brave British drag artists and landed earlier this year in Texas, USA. Led by filmmaker Zoe Davis, our destination was the <i>Austin International Drag Festival - </i><b>the first of its kind in the world</b>. Excitement was high, and no one knew what to expect. We were committed to representing the UK at the inaugural event - and documenting what unfolded along the way. </p>
<p>We followed our fearless ensemble on a journey through a new frontier.  </p>
<p>Our spirits were bold, our hearts were hopeful... but our funds were light! <br/>
We were doing this out of love.</p>
<p>For most of our Kings and Queens, going to Texas was the furthest they’d ever travelled in their lives, and representing British drag in America was a bold and significant step for all of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442248122/yudcxc9bchs6nsemubim.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>FIERCE!</b> is a film about the real lives of British drag artists. <br/><br/>It's a documentary that honours the rich culture of contemporary drag, and honours the inspirational work of these artists - a fearless group who have long been influencing change in LGBT history, right back to the Stonewall riots of 1969.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442266565/ofrysrzuvpc8jllz1kej.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 278.012px;height: 325px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442266900/vnupho6hjvizrdeuvgyi.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;width: 281.1428571428571px;height: 328px;""/></p>
<p>We spend time behind the scenes,  getting to know the cast in and out of drag, watching their lives, their outfits and their personas evolve. We witness their transformations, their setbacks, their struggles and their successes. <br/><br/><b>FIERCE! </b>is a film with heart, a film with integrity. <br/>We hope it goes down in history. </p>
<p>It aims to bring the real face of drag into wider public consciousness; to tell the stories of the talented and tirelessly campaigning individuals for whom drag isn't just a superficial career, it's a way of life. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Earlier this year, we corralled together an amazing production crew and pulled off a <b>huge</b> feat of independent documentary making... but we still have more work to do!</p>

<p>Spending 5 days shooting amidst the colourful madness of <i>Austin Drag Fest </i>was just the tip of a rainbow-covered iceberg. None of us were prepared for what happened next…</p>
<p>During the shooting of <b>FIERCE!</b> we witnessed an unexpected victory in the fight for marriage equality - when the Supreme Court legalised same-sex marriage in all 50 states of America on 26 June 2015! </p>
<p>
Determined to capture this inspiring break-through in world history, we kept our cameras rolling as some powerful stories began to emerge. </p>

</div></div>","We packed up a troupe of brave British drag artists and landed earlier this year in Texas, USA. Led by filmmaker Zoe Davis, our destination was the Austin International Drag Festival - the first of its kind in the world. Excitement was high, and no one knew what to expect. We were committed to representing the UK at the inaugural event - and documenting what unfolded along the way. 
We followed our fearless ensemble on a journey through a new frontier.  
Our spirits were bold, our hearts were hopeful... but our funds were light! 
We were doing this out of love.
For most of our Kings and Queens, going to Texas was the furthest they’d ever travelled in their lives, and representing British drag in America was a bold and significant step for all of them. 


FIERCE! is a film about the real lives of British drag artists. It's a documentary that honours the rich culture of contemporary drag, and honours the inspirational work of these artists - a fearless group who have long been influencing change in LGBT history, right back to the Stonewall riots of 1969.
    
We spend time behind the scenes,  getting to know the cast in and out of drag, watching their lives, their outfits and their personas evolve. We witness their transformations, their setbacks, their struggles and their successes. FIERCE! is a film with heart, a film with integrity. We hope it goes down in history. 
It aims to bring the real face of drag into wider public consciousness; to tell the stories of the talented and tirelessly campaigning individuals for whom drag isn't just a superficial career, it's a way of life. 

Earlier this year, we corralled together an amazing production crew and pulled off a huge feat of independent documentary making... but we still have more work to do!


 
Spending 5 days shooting amidst the colourful madness of Austin Drag Fest was just the tip of a rainbow-covered iceberg. None of us were prepared for what happened next…
During the shooting of FIERCE! we witnessed an unexpected victory in the fight for marriage equality - when the Supreme Court legalised same-sex marriage in all 50 states of America on 26 June 2015! 

Determined to capture this inspiring break-through in world history, we kept our cameras rolling as some powerful stories began to emerge. 
 



In our lifetimes, history is rarely made in such an awe-inspiring way. FIERCE! captures these moving moments, and much, much more.
We believe that these powerful stories need to reach a world-wide audience.
As the fight for equality continues, FIERCE! gives its colourful campaigners a human face. Beyond the sequins their struggles are real, and we need your help to spread that message. 





We’re inviting you into the family to help us finish the film: Join TEAM FIERCE today!



 
You can help by contributing to the film and sharing the campaign far and wide. 


Even if you're not able to contribute financially to the film (though frankly, the perks are so damn good...you'd be a fool not to!) - sharing the project with EVERYONE you know is a huge support - because it might just end up being shared with the right person down the line: someone who can offer a stunning contribution to get our production to its magnificent finish line. 
So please share FIERCE! The Movie as much as you can - the film's fabulous cast deserve their red carpet moment more than anyone, so let's make it happen!
Documentaries don't come more dazzlingly human than this.

Up to this point, production has been entirely self-funded. 

Your generous FIERCE contributions will go toward:
~ Music Rights (drag queens love their pop songs...)~ Graphics and Visual Effects
~ Sound Design and Mixing 
~ Marketing~ Film Crew to complete the documentary~ Insurance and DeliveryThe core of our FIERCE! team are in place, but we need to add the final layers to give our production the professional polish we know it can achieve. This is so that it has the best possible chance of a UK-wide and International cinema release. 
We’re also aiming to seek further funding to cover music licensing, so that we'll be able to use the fierce original soundtracks from the sensational live drag performances we've captured on film so far. 



In the coming days we’re going to introduce the TEAM FIERCE! family, more content, and lots of other exciting things to boot. This is a truly exciting time for the film, and we want you to be a part of the experience with us. 
So if you've read this far, firstly - THANK YOU! 
Check out our dazzling array of quirky perks! Consider getting involved, check back here for updates and find out just how FIERCELY things are evolving as we get closer to finishing the film...

<p>Captive Audience is a suspense thriller created following
season one of the Detective Chronicles, a web series created by LaPala L.
Crawford. This story has been a dream project for LaPala
because he grew up watching films of this nature. In Captive
Audience, Detective Terri Carson faces one of the most difficult cases of her
career. Her partner, Detective Angelo Graham, has gone missing and her only
clue is an old case file he left behind. Time is running out as Angelo finds
himself and five strangers held captive by a madman who is set on a path of
destruction.</p>
<p><b>What We Need from You</b></p>
<p>We have some of the resources to have a successful premiere,
but we also need additional resources to finalize post-production and also to
enter the film into festivals and contests. That's where you come in. You can
see the various donation options that would help us get the remaining funding
we need. </p>
<p><b>Why Do We Need Your Help?</b></p>
<p>As with any independent film, there is a budget. Some items
were secured in order to show our supporters that we are just as committed to
making a quality film as we want you to be. We need your help to round out the
budget and cover some of the additional expenses.</p>
<p>The one thing we want everyone to know and understand is
that in order for anyone to be successful, help is needed from supporters. We
ask that you please support us, ask your friends and family to support us, and
we will be sure to show you how much we value your support by producing a
quality, engaging film.</p>
<p><b>Risks and challenges</b></p>
<p>We are in for a challenging but rewarding process in
finalizing ""Captive Audience."" The biggest risk we will face is
navigating around the aggressive schedules of the post-production crew. To
overcome this risk we have alternate meeting dates in place, and at the most,
we will only miss our finishing deadline by a few days, which has been padded
to give us time for the successful launch. </p>
<p>Having shot a short film and feature with a much smaller
budget and less resources in a smaller time frame, we believe that with your
help we can overcome the obstacles we ran into with the other two films.
Shooting this film has gone a lot smoother because we had a benchmark from
which to work and we used many of the lessons learned to upgrade our skills and
approach to this film.</p>
<p><b>Words from the Director</b></p>
<p>I would first like to thank my Heavenly Father, Jesus
Christ, for blessing me with the gift of writing and the talents related to
filming. I would like to thank our cast and crew for their hard work and
diligence in getting the scenes filmed. None of this would be possible if you
had not agreed to be a part of the project. Thank you to our current supporters
who are now a part of the Prime8Vision family. I appreciate every one of you
for all you have done.</p>
<p>This has been an AMAZING journey. The filming process was
definitely a lot of hard work, but well worth every bit of it. I would like to
finish just as strong as we started and I have faith that we will finish very
strong.</p>

we will be sure to show you how much we value your support by producing a
quality, engaging film.
Risks and challenges
We are in for a challenging but rewarding process in
finalizing ""Captive Audience."" The biggest risk we will face is
navigating around the aggressive schedules of the post-production crew. To
overcome this risk we have alternate meeting dates in place, and at the most,
we will only miss our finishing deadline by a few days, which has been padded
to give us time for the successful launch. 
Having shot a short film and feature with a much smaller
budget and less resources in a smaller time frame, we believe that with your
help we can overcome the obstacles we ran into with the other two films.
Shooting this film has gone a lot smoother because we had a benchmark from
which to work and we used many of the lessons learned to upgrade our skills and
approach to this film.
Words from the Director
I would first like to thank my Heavenly Father, Jesus
Christ, for blessing me with the gift of writing and the talents related to
filming. I would like to thank our cast and crew for their hard work and
diligence in getting the scenes filmed. None of this would be possible if you
had not agreed to be a part of the project. Thank you to our current supporters
who are now a part of the Prime8Vision family. I appreciate every one of you
for all you have done.
This has been an AMAZING journey. The filming process was
definitely a lot of hard work, but well worth every bit of it. I would like to
finish just as strong as we started and I have faith that we will finish very
strong.

<b>WHO WE ARE <b>
</b></b><br/><div>CoAbode® connects single mothers for house sharing so they can pool their resources, gain economic stability, emotional support, and provide a safe environment for their children. <br/>There are hundreds of
thousands of single mothers searching for us every week. Stressed, overburdened,
and overworked single moms, who are searching for a better way of life.  What these women find is more than a shared
housing solution. They also gain a quality of life that they wouldn’t have found
alone. <br/><br/><i><b><b>
<i>CoAbode was founded on the principle that two
single moms raising children together can achieve more than one struggling
alone.</i> </b></b></i><br/><p><b><span></span></b></p>
<p><span>There are over 10 million single mothers raising more than 20
million children on their own in the United States alone.</span> I was one of them - feeling
powerless, lonely, and doubtful about everything, while raising my
little boy. Then, I had a moment of
clarity and started looking for other single moms who might want to pool
their resources and share a home. Eighteen interviews later, but I had not only met
another mom with similar philosophies and priorities, I was able to put some of
the other single moms in contact with one another.<span>  CoAbode<sup>®</sup> was born.
It is an online house sharing service currently designed for single moms and <b>soon to be expanded to single dads and senior citizens.</b><br/></span></p>

<p><b>Did you know that 1/3 of single moms
don't get any child support?  And that 40% live below the poverty level?
 Another 80% of single moms make only about $24,000 a year and almost half
of them have to work 2 jobs.  That's why CoAbode needs your help!</b></p>
<p>Our service
gives relief and guidance through house sharing opportunities, specialized support
groups, affordable housing, and vital resources designed to make parenting
alone easier, healthier, and more secure.</p>

the member database for others in their preferred region, and contact
potential roommates through anonymous email. Once matched, the moms can access better and safer homes and school districts. </p>
<p><b>Since most
single moms are in desperate situations, they can’t afford to pay for this
service.  So CoAbode offers all its services for
FREE with your help! <b>When you

<p>It’s time for
CoAbode® to build on its successes so that we can meet the growing demand for the service. Our goal for this campaign
is to raise capital for the following:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>1.
 We need to expand the CoAbode® website. </p>
<p><span><span></span></span>The
site is currently not able to handle the amount of traffic we get and becomes overloaded and keeps crashing. We have to rebuild and improve the site's stability
while making additional services (Friend Circle,
Affordable Housing Access, Collaborative Partners Program, Single Mother’s Resources) more interactive for shared housing members</p>
<p>2.  Hire staff (Dedicated team members to accomplish CoAbode's® goals)</p>
<p>We need staff to:  <br/></p>
<p>a) Develop and update program systems and processes.</p>
<p>b) Create a marketing strategy to expand our resources for women and children, locally, regionally  and globally.</p>
<p>c) Develop a monetization strategy for self sustainability. <br/></p>

<p><i><b>I think it is one of the best ideas I've seen on the
Internet. I am facing an upcoming divorce and one of my biggest worries were :
1. finding affordable housing 2. Being totally alone (all my family live in
Europe). Your website offers a simple solution to both! </b><b>RENATA</b></i><br/></p>
<p>CoAbode makes
a difference and you can too.  When you contribute to our campaign you are
helping in all these ways: </p>
<p><b>1.  Enhanced financial conditions</b></p>
<p>·  Single
moms can create and maintain more affordable living arrangements and ultimately
a healthier, happier lifestyle.</p>
<p>·  Some
divorced mothers can keep the family home by having another single mom roommate
halve maintenance costs.</p>
<p>·  With
resources less strained, moms with lower paying jobs don’t need to depend on
government assistance.</p>
<p>·
 Mothers can manage their finances more effectively, and have more
discretionary funds to pursue activities that add quality to their own and
their children’s lives.</p>
<p><b>2.  Promote domestic abuse/violence
prevention </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>·  With
another housing alternative, single moms are empowered to escape abusive
situations</p>
<p>·
 Roommates have often provided emotional support in an abused single mom’s
situation.</p>
<p>·  Our
data reveals that many women have indeed successfully left a violent household
through CoAbode® house sharing.</p>
<p><b>3.  Enhanced quality of life </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>·
 Splitting household responsibilities alleviates fatigue and stress,
improves time management, and therefore makes for a healthier relationship with
the children and perhaps increases private time for themselves.</p>
<p>· <b> Women
have reported that through house sharing, they have gained an additional 56
hours a month on average.</b></p>
<p>We know that
there are millions of single moms who probably aren’t aware of the shared housing
opportunity because they’ve not yet heard of us. And even still, some who have,
may discover that there are no other potential housing matches in her locale.</p>
<p>In each of
these cases, matches are not immediate, may take longer than a member desires,
or may not happen at all. Many single mothers like to be able to act and see
results according to her personal situation. Our worst risk is a discouraged
single mother still without viable housing.</p>
<p>However, this
is precisely why CoAbode® has launched this campaign. It is our mission to
upgrade to a more powerful website and recruit paid staff to begin fully
developing programs in response to single mothers’ feedback about their
experiences before getting matched, and while and after settling into a house share.
We are here to continuously close the gap for single mothers who need CoAbode®
but have not yet secured shared housing. CoAbode® will continue to help as long
as there are single mothers.</p>
<p> We all deeply appreciate your contributions!</p>

<p>We met through CoAbode, the four of us became house mates. Now we eat breakfast as a family
together every morning. A few nights a week after the kids are put to bed we
can hang out in the den and chat or watch TV. Occasionally, one of us can go out with friends, leaving
the other mom in charge of the sleeping kids. That's the main thing you need
most as a single parent. Sometimes, you just need a break. Despite age and
gender differences, Dorian and Reagan have bonded. They are very sibling-like.

make their lives and mine better!” <br/></span>

<p></p>
<p>It was a breath of fresh air to see your ad, inviting single moms, (Me and Mine!!!) Your website and mission moved me greatly. Why? Because for the last several months, I've been thinking, and hoping, that there existed a group of women that share my difficult and awkward situation. Actually, it's not even a bad or unhealthy place to be... We've taken our power, our kids, our freedom, walked away from physical, mental and emotional abuse, (A healthy message and example for our kids) and we need to collaborate with other women who have had the courage to do the same thing... When I get soooo overwhelmed being the perfect mother, the chauffeur, the cook, the masseuse, the tutor and homework person, the financial provider, the social secretary, the shopper for cloths, food, extra accessories for trips, the Dad, the disciplinarian, etc., etc., I often say to myself, there must be a family, an organization, a group of single parents, men a/or women, with great kids who would love to live together and share responsibilities. Not based on a romantic relationship, but simply on a practical opportunity to co-exist.... and give our children the best environment possible. I think you have a brilliant idea, and a wonderful opportunity to uplift and support thousands of women who are suffering and need help... <b> Karen, Los Angeles</b><br/></p>

</div></div>","WHO WE ARE 
CoAbode® connects single mothers for house sharing so they can pool their resources, gain economic stability, emotional support, and provide a safe environment for their children. There are hundreds of
thousands of single mothers searching for us every week. Stressed, overburdened,
and overworked single moms, who are searching for a better way of life.  What these women find is more than a shared
housing solution. They also gain a quality of life that they wouldn’t have found
alone. 
CoAbode was founded on the principle that two
single moms raising children together can achieve more than one struggling
alone. 
There are over 10 million single mothers raising more than 20
million children on their own in the United States alone. I was one of them - feeling
powerless, lonely, and doubtful about everything, while raising my
little boy. Then, I had a moment of
clarity and started looking for other single moms who might want to pool
their resources and share a home. Eighteen interviews later, but I had not only met
another mom with similar philosophies and priorities, I was able to put some of
the other single moms in contact with one another.  CoAbode® was born.
It is an online house sharing service currently designed for single moms and soon to be expanded to single dads and senior citizens.



                                         EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS
… I never
dreamed sharing a home would be this amazing. Simpler. Better. Happier.  Easier. Cheaper.  DANIELLE
... Economically,
we are able to share half the costs of gas, electric, phone and rent, so we can
provide a better life for our children and ourselves. LATISHA 



                                     
SINGLE MOMS NEED YOUR HELP



Did you know that 1/3 of single moms
don't get any child support?  And that 40% live below the poverty level?
 Another 80% of single moms make only about $24,000 a year and almost half
of them have to work 2 jobs.  That's why CoAbode needs your help!
Our service
gives relief and guidance through house sharing opportunities, specialized support
groups, affordable housing, and vital resources designed to make parenting
alone easier, healthier, and more secure.
The CoAbode® website allows users to register via an online application, search
the member database for others in their preferred region, and contact
potential roommates through anonymous email. Once matched, the moms can access better and safer homes and school districts. 
Since most
single moms are in desperate situations, they can’t afford to pay for this
service.  So CoAbode offers all its services for
FREE with your help! When you
contribute $25 to our campaign, it pays for 1 single mother to be sponsored. 


Stressed,
overburdened, and overworked single moms, who are searching for a better way of
life rely on us to help them. Please contribute today.
CoAbode® has resonated among
single families and the media, the demand for our service is growing exponentially. We have proved how house sharing helps female-headed households. Being
overburdened affects a single mom’s health, job performance, and her ability to
focus on parenting.


                                                          MEDIA

CoAbode
has been featured in Time Magazine, USA Today, Diane Sawyer with Good Morning
America, NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw,
Christian Science Monitor, Fox’s Inside
Edition, CNN and many
other media outlets.

“CoAbode® is the de novo service provider
using an innovative program which is unique and creative, and targets an ever
increasing niche in our current society - single moms. Your computerized system
may prove more efficient and cost effective than the more
traditional/conventional systems used by so many service
providers.” Jason
Coughenour, Director, HUD Los Angeles 

CoAbode’s
system fuels economic self-sufficiency and emotional wellness, revolutionizing
what constitutes a thriving family.
Besides the
shared services network, other CoAbode® benefits include specialized support
groups for childcare, babysitting co-ops, and access to vital community
resources. 
Social
entrepreneur Carmel Sullivan-Boss, founder of CoAbode®, leads and manages all
aspects of the organization. She has 20+ years of experience in both for-profit
and non-profit sectors. Her support team includes local women leaders in their
professional fields, some of whom were CoAbode® members and successfully established house sharing through CoAbode®. They contribute as paid professional
consultants in the areas of web technology, business development, strategic
planning, and financial management.
I
applaud you on your service.  It is a need long awaited to be filled.

“It’s
a necessity.  If it weren’t for sharing the care of my kids with another
mom, I wouldn’t have a life” KAREN
                               WHAT WE NEED/WHY WE NEED FUNDING

We need to rebuild the website and
expand the CoAbode house share service for increased service availability in 2016
and beyond.
It’s time for
CoAbode® to build on its successes so that we can meet the growing demand for the service. Our goal for this campaign
is to raise capital for the following:


1.
 We need to expand the CoAbode® website. 
The
site is currently not able to handle the amount of traffic we get and becomes overloaded and keeps crashing. We have to rebuild and improve the site's stability
while making additional services (Friend Circle,
Affordable Housing Access, Collaborative Partners Program, Single Mother’s Resources) more interactive for shared housing members
2.  Hire staff (Dedicated team members to accomplish CoAbode's® goals)
We need staff to:  
a) Develop and update program systems and processes.
b) Create a marketing strategy to expand our resources for women and children, locally, regionally  and globally.
c) Develop a monetization strategy for self sustainability. 
CoAbode offers its services for
FREE! When you
contribute $25 to our campaign, it pays for 1 single mother to be sponsored. 
When we speak
to women with children, their primary focuses are housing, safety, education,
medical, and environmental issues. These are also community issues. 
CoAbode®
believes that when we make the right tools available to single mothers, we are
in fact supporting the well-being of our communities and country at
large.
When you
contribute to this campaign, you’re helping to expand the service with advanced technological infrastructure and program development.

                   

I think it is one of the best ideas I've seen on the
Internet. I am facing an upcoming divorce and one of my biggest worries were :
1. finding affordable housing 2. Being totally alone (all my family live in
Europe). Your website offers a simple solution to both! RENATA
CoAbode makes
a difference and you can too.  When you contribute to our campaign you are
helping in all these ways: 
1.  Enhanced financial conditions
·  Single
moms can create and maintain more affordable living arrangements and ultimately
a healthier, happier lifestyle.
·  Some
divorced mothers can keep the family home by having another single mom roommate
halve maintenance costs.
·  With
resources less strained, moms with lower paying jobs don’t need to depend on
government assistance.
·
 Mothers can manage their finances more effectively, and have more
discretionary funds to pursue activities that add quality to their own and
their children’s lives.
2.  Promote domestic abuse/violence
prevention 

·  With
another housing alternative, single moms are empowered to escape abusive
situations
·
 Roommates have often provided emotional support in an abused single mom’s
situation.
·  Our
data reveals that many women have indeed successfully left a violent household
through CoAbode® house sharing.
3.  Enhanced quality of life 

·
 Splitting household responsibilities alleviates fatigue and stress,
improves time management, and therefore makes for a healthier relationship with
the children and perhaps increases private time for themselves.
·  Women
have reported that through house sharing, they have gained an additional 56
hours a month on average.
We know that
there are millions of single moms who probably aren’t aware of the shared housing
opportunity because they’ve not yet heard of us. And even still, some who have,
may discover that there are no other potential housing matches in her locale.
In each of
these cases, matches are not immediate, may take longer than a member desires,
or may not happen at all. Many single mothers like to be able to act and see
results according to her personal situation. Our worst risk is a discouraged
single mother still without viable housing.
However, this
is precisely why CoAbode® has launched this campaign. It is our mission to
upgrade to a more powerful website and recruit paid staff to begin fully
developing programs in response to single mothers’ feedback about their
experiences before getting matched, and while and after settling into a house share.
We are here to continuously close the gap for single mothers who need CoAbode®
but have not yet secured shared housing. CoAbode® will continue to help as long
as there are single mothers.
 We all deeply appreciate your contributions!

""we're here to support one another as much as
we can.""   

""Because our sons are both only children, it's
been good for them to have brotherly attention and learn that they are not the
center of the universe, And we're here to support
one another as much as we can."" For example, recently when Allen had a
late class, Shawn picked up my son from school, fed and bathed him and put
him to bed. And we trade off like that constantly, which makes life less
stressful for both of us. Shawn and Darcie in Washington, DC






“Sometimes
you just get tired.  And having a friend
nearby and having support has, you know, made it easier”   


CoAbode is the greatest and I
would be honored to further the cause We are now coaboding , after knowing
each other's families for a year. We are starting to build a business together
as well, helping women in creative businesses...

Cynthia and Lili in NY
 

""Well, I'm just going
to make him my brother!"" insisted 4-year-old Reagan after her mother
explained that she and Dorian were not related. 


We met through CoAbode, the four of us became house mates. Now we eat breakfast as a family
together every morning. A few nights a week after the kids are put to bed we
can hang out in the den and chat or watch TV. Occasionally, one of us can go out with friends, leaving
the other mom in charge of the sleeping kids. That's the main thing you need
most as a single parent. Sometimes, you just need a break. Despite age and
gender differences, Dorian and Reagan have bonded. They are very sibling-like.

Alison and Sheila in Atlanta GA
“I’m a far better mother because I'm less stressed.""                                                  In a town outside of Minneapolis, Jennifer and
Simone came to each others economic rescue. The single mothers, were
desperate. Jennifer had two children, ages 4 and 3 months; a house; and a
mortgage way beyond her means.

“I would definitely recommend the
service to anyone”                                               Had it not been for CoAbode I never would have pursued a home share
situation.  I would definitely recommend the service to
anyone (and have) I think CoAbode is great it gave me the support I needed to
seek what I believe is the best possible living arrangement for my son being a
single mom and not having the support of the other parent.  I thank you for creating this service that helped me find
this great opportunity that we both have now. Stacey 



Michelle in Brooklyn “she was a godsend”                                                                             I mean she was a godsend, I
just couldn't figure out how I was going to do it alone. Now we are looking for
a third housemate.



Christeen in California“it is really
wonderful” I recently hooked up with a
single mother from CoAbode for shared housing and she moved in with me at the
beginning of August - it is really wonderful to create 'family' in that way.  
Katie in Texas “It
is a fantastic way for single mothers to find compatible living situations and
create alternative 'family”                                                                               I met a mother of a young
girl thru your website who lived with me for over a year.  We became good
friends and her daughter is the flower girl in my upcoming wedding.  It
is a fantastic way for single mothers to find compatible living situations and
create alternative 'family'. 


Kathy  “We
are very much a family and my son refers to her kids as his brother and his
sister! have been house sharing with another single mom
successfully for one year. My son is 4 1/2 and her children are 3 1/2 and 6.We
are very much a ""family ""and my son refers to her kids as his brother
and his sister! I love your service. Sincerely


Danielle in Washington   ""But I never dreamed it would be this
amazing.  Simpler.  Better. 
Happier.  Easier.  Cheaper.”                                                                       I feel I owe a lot to
CoAbode. My life is definitely better because of your efforts, and I am
grateful every day for how your idea has changed my life. Thank you for all you
have done.  


Anonymous “This is a valuable service I believe it can save moms and
children from abusive situation”                                                                                                                    I would still be living with
an abusive husband if I did not find another single mom to share a house
with.  I know there are a lot of other moms who feel
trapped in bad situations who would move in a heartbeat if they knew that they
did have options.  My ex tried to
convince me that there was no way I could make it on my own. I almost
believed him.  But I am able to with the
help of another single mom. This is a
valuable service that I believe can save moms and children from abusive
situations. 


Star  “It’s a
necessity.  If it weren’t for sharing the
care of my kids with another mom, I wouldn’t have a life”                                                                                          As a mom you want help, you
don’t yearn to be alone. There needs to be financial and emotional support, and
we’re finding creative ways of giving it to each other.  House sharing holds a deep meaning for me
that’s about women starting to parent together again.
” 


Audrey, CA  “We’ve got a much
better house than either of us could have afforded alone”  I joined CoAbode with very
low expectations.  I really didn’t
believe that I would make a connection there that would result in sharing a
house but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to give it a shot.  It seemed that working through personal
connections was a better place to start. 
I was totally wrong. CoAbode is great because it’s
a central point for single mums who are looking to accomplish the exact same
thing… a better living situation for themselves and their kids.  My roommate and I met on CoAbode.  We’ve been living together with our combined
three children for a year and it is really fantastic.  Because we’re pooling finances we’ve got a
much better house than either of us could have afforded alone. We share chores
like cooking and shopping so our stress factors have gone down.  It really has improved my
life immensely.  I feel extremely grateful to CoAbode
for making something very difficult so much easier, and I recommend this kind
of choice to any single mum who finds it tough going alone. 


Stephanie, Atlanta GA “Your program worked perfectly”  I have recently moved in with
a woman that I met through your program. 
I have two daughters and she has one. 
When we met, it was great because we were actually friends when we were
younger.  It worked out perfectly! 



Barbara, San Diego, CA  “It’s
sheer heaven” I have found a tremendous
sense of relief in house sharing. My kids have also seen the
positive results of house sharing.  They
enjoy having playmates, and mom being able to spend more time and money on
them.  The greatest benefit of all is
noticing my kids have more respect for me as they see I am making an effort to
make their lives and mine better!” 

Freya, CA I've been able to save through house sharing (rent, utilities, childcare, etc.)? $500 I've
started taking classes towards a degree and my daughter is in a better daycare.

By
enabling single moms to connect with like minded single moms for house sharing
CoAbode offers a solid, ALTERNATIVE solution to serious problems.  The majority of our single mom participants
say they would NEVER have considered pooling resources with another single mom
were it not for hearing or reading about the service we provide.  Just by existing, we provide a bright light
at the end of a very dark tunnel.


OMG,  I just need to say a
huge thank you and send you a humongous virtual hug.  I'm recently divorced
myself and I've dreamed of a service just like this.  What a wonderful
wonderful community..I was in tears reading through it and of course signed up
immediately. Wendei


It was a breath of fresh air to see your ad, inviting single moms, (Me and Mine!!!) Your website and mission moved me greatly. Why? Because for the last several months, I've been thinking, and hoping, that there existed a group of women that share my difficult and awkward situation. Actually, it's not even a bad or unhealthy place to be... We've taken our power, our kids, our freedom, walked away from physical, mental and emotional abuse, (A healthy message and example for our kids) and we need to collaborate with other women who have had the courage to do the same thing... When I get soooo overwhelmed being the perfect mother, the chauffeur, the cook, the masseuse, the tutor and homework person, the financial provider, the social secretary, the shopper for cloths, food, extra accessories for trips, the Dad, the disciplinarian, etc., etc., I often say to myself, there must be a family, an organization, a group of single parents, men a/or women, with great kids who would love to live together and share responsibilities. Not based on a romantic relationship, but simply on a practical opportunity to co-exist.... and give our children the best environment possible. I think you have a brilliant idea, and a wonderful opportunity to uplift and support thousands of women who are suffering and need help...  Karen, Los Angeles

Brilliant! Brilliant!                                                                                                              

Dear CoAbode: You have no idea how grateful I am that you exist, because the services you
offer are SO NECESSARY in this world!  I find it truly remarkable
what you are doing for woman in our society!  Malka




I think the program you are providing is a valuable support
system for women and their children. 
Congratulations on your work!

I have just
found your website and I LOVE IT!!!! I am a single mom with SIX children!!! I
have been divorced officially for a few months now- but my ex- husband chose to
leave us almost 2 years ago... 
I live in Dallas, Texas and am very interested to meet other single parents-
and would love to begin a single moms group and facilitate it!!! 
I would appreciate any info... Thanks so much for all that you all do...  
Renee, Dallas, TX
I'm so moved by your generosity toward single mothers and their
families, and toward me and mine in particular. I hardly can find words to
thank you, because ""thank you"" doesn't feel like enough.
Your service is exactly what
I need! congratulations on a wonderful idea. Beth, Glendale
You instituted a great idea
with this. Lyn, New Jersey

This is a great idea - rent in Toronto has gone crazy.  The price for a decent apartment is a lot
more than one income can afford.  Do you
know of any similar service in Canada? Sarah, Canada

What a beautiful effort -
you are making the world a better place. Michelle, LA, CA

Nikki, Scotland.  On a web
site search for single parents in Edinburgh Scotland I came across your site -
do you have any members in Scotland.
I am a former single mom and would like to
share your site! Great Idea! 
I am so excited and happy
that I found you ladies, it is a WONDERFUL thing what you are doing and the
service you provide, God knows we MOM's need all the help we can get. Cynthia, Pasadena, Ca
I am the Health Education
Program Coordinator at Dallas Healthy Start. I would love to be
able to pass it on to our outreach workers. Thank you, Charlotte, Dallas, TX

On a more personal note, I
am a single mom of three (including twins), and I know that my roommates have
proven invaluable.  It was difficult to
find them, however, and I think that your service answers a very real need with
a very real solution.  Thank you for
taking the time and energy to do this thing for the moms and their children. Christina. PA
Parent Partner, Even Start Hello - I was excited to see the ad
for this program. Christine San

I read about your website in
the December issue of Fit Pregnancy and had to see it. It's a terrific idea,
congratulations! Fiona

What a BRILLIANT idea! What
a great idea!  Lisa, FL.




Hi, I've joined CoAbode to
build a circle of friends in my area. I think this is a terrific idea and a
valuable service. Thanks! Kirst WA
Your web-site is a hope for
single mothers that there are others out there in similar situations who just
need a little help to get ahead.  Thank You, Susan
I haven't had any luck with
house sharing yet, but the ""Circle of Friends"" is working great.  I have had 8 responses since I volunteered to
be a facilitator and we have started organizing
ourselves and had our first get together on Mother's Day and we have next
weekend planned already.  CoAbode is more
than just house sharing so if they are interested in any other aspects of it, I’d volunteer
to be a resource. Sammy Atlanta, GA
CoAbode made a big
difference in my life by opening my eyes to a new way to make connections. It
helped me realize I wasn't the only one out there, and that we all need to
support each other. Thanks so much for being there when I needed to know that
there were options. Name: Jaye, From: CA

Wednesday marks her first task- to infiltrate the world renown terrorist group called the Ravens. The Ravens themselves are a metaphor for today's ISIS group and brings to the forefront the horrible deeds that such an institution is capable of. I aim to not only entertain an audience but to voice my viewpoint on such matters- conflict is inevitable and in our nature but we can still make great changes in the way we treat ourselves in order to make way for a brighter future for our children. </p>

<h4>STANA</h4>
<p>Stana, the mysterious operative brought to the British
Intelligence Agency by an unknown party, is tasked with overthrowing
the most feared terrorist organization in the world- The Ravens. Very
little is known about her and even the reluctant MI6 don't fully
trust her. In order for this 6 year long mission to be a success, she
must first overcome the worst stage of it- the initiation. Will she survive?
And if she does, will that necessarily be a good thing?  </p>

Her calm, cool and easy going demeanor along with her raw quiet talent instantly won her the role of Stana. Director Donavan Clark had his eye on her from the second he watched her audition reel which showcased a calm, understated but powerful performance along with a much lighter comedic role, showing great range and flexibility. What attracted the casting director the most was her versatile take on the character and willingness to adapt performance to better suit the film and her uncanny talent in performing without the need for speaking. She is excited to be apart of the film and cannot wait to work with its team. She is a true gem and will without a doubt become a big name in this business. For now, she is ready to get down and dirty as the strong willed, silent Stana.</span></p>

<h4>ALEXEI MIKAILOV</h4>
<p>Alexei's military history makes him a formidable addition to the terrorist organization that employs him. He is a self converted, yet loyal servant of Vladamir Gerza and a firm believer in the ""Ravens"" cause. Throughout the film, he acts as right hand to Gerza, barking orders at Nikolai, guarding Stana, even maiming her himself at times, and making sure this torturous process goes unhindered. Alexei is quite possibly Stana's biggest obstacle as far as proving her worth is concerned.<br/></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5012442/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greg Pierot</a> is known for his work on Sweethearts of the Galaxy(2013) and Ninja Apocalypse (2014). Rare in most actors, Greg likes to play to his strengths which are tormented, shady, evil characters. He was immediately hooked on the script once his colleague Donavan Clark showed it to him and the character of Nikolai immediately jumped out at him. Coincidentally, his work in the audition room as a line feeder got the attention of his director and was easily cast  as the maniacal villain. He very much looks forward to the brutal physicality that the role demands and is up for the challenge of bringing this man to life. He is in love with this career defining role and will push harder than ever to be faithful to his director's intentions. </p>

Justin studied Theatre Performance at Florida Southern College and then attended Wayne State University for graduate studies in Acting. In 2009, he studied abroad at Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre School, the home of the original ""method acting"". His film debut was in the 2012 indie film 'Little Shadows', wherein he starred as sensitive ghost-hunter &amp; photographer, Jack Alva. In 2014 he co-starred in 'The Brittany Murphy Story' with Eric Petersen and Amanda Fuller. Justin came to director Donavan Clark, a man he had once met before on a baseball feature entitled ""Undrafted"", after hearing of his casting call. Even without this bias, Justin wowed Donavan as well as Greg Peirot with his sympathetic and panicked take on Billy Holden. It took only a short meeting to finally come to the conclusion that Justin was not only the best choice but the only true choice for this tragic role.</span><br/></p>

</p><p><br/></p><b>
</b><br/></div>","Hello and welcome! My name is Donavan Clark, a 3 year Los Angeles local and the writer, director and producer of Wednesday. In addition to being a filmmaker, I am an experienced film set gaffer and key grip. Wednesday will be my first LA-based project. My ultimate mission is to create intriguing and thought provoking stories and realizing them on screen and this is the best project to start that journey, read on if you'd like to know more...





      

This campaign will bring to life the film Wednesday, the beginning of a series based on a mysterious female operative with a murky past. Wednesday marks her first task- to infiltrate the world renown terrorist group called the Ravens. The Ravens themselves are a metaphor for today's ISIS group and brings to the forefront the horrible deeds that such an institution is capable of. I aim to not only entertain an audience but to voice my viewpoint on such matters- conflict is inevitable and in our nature but we can still make great changes in the way we treat ourselves in order to make way for a brighter future for our children. 


The Players






STANA
Stana, the mysterious operative brought to the British
Intelligence Agency by an unknown party, is tasked with overthrowing
the most feared terrorist organization in the world- The Ravens. Very
little is known about her and even the reluctant MI6 don't fully
trust her. In order for this 6 year long mission to be a success, she
must first overcome the worst stage of it- the initiation. Will she survive?
And if she does, will that necessarily be a good thing?  




Karli Hall is a young up and coming actress that absolutely impressed at auditions for Wednesday. Her calm, cool and easy going demeanor along with her raw quiet talent instantly won her the role of Stana. Director Donavan Clark had his eye on her from the second he watched her audition reel which showcased a calm, understated but powerful performance along with a much lighter comedic role, showing great range and flexibility. What attracted the casting director the most was her versatile take on the character and willingness to adapt performance to better suit the film and her uncanny talent in performing without the need for speaking. She is excited to be apart of the film and cannot wait to work with its team. She is a true gem and will without a doubt become a big name in this business. For now, she is ready to get down and dirty as the strong willed, silent Stana.









VLADAMIR GERZA
An old, bitter,  eccentric Russian mob boss that has seen all there is to see in warfare and more . Although he had innocent beginnings he was scarred for life when Americans brutally murdered his parents in front of him at a young age. He is a huge cog in the machine and is in charge of alot of the operations that go out of his ""sector"". He is a long time lieutenant of the ""Ravens"" terrorist cell and believes everything that he puts Stana through is absolutely necessary to ensure the Ravens legacy remains intact.



Primarily recognized as a military or technical skills character in film and television, Forest Baker was an accomplished East Coast stage actor in his early 20's. Born in 1948 in Wabash Indiana he attended Holy Cross College on a Track and Football scholarship graduating in 1970, taught college and received an MS in Biology at Villanova University in 1972 and an MBA from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania in 1975.
Known for playing heavy characters with intelligence and gravitas Forest returned to Los Angeles in 2015 to act in independent movie and television productions building credentials, raw experience and momentum as a day-player leading to supporting roles in major films. This is a work-in-progress.





ALEXEI MIKAILOV
Alexei's military history makes him a formidable addition to the terrorist organization that employs him. He is a self converted, yet loyal servant of Vladamir Gerza and a firm believer in the ""Ravens"" cause. Throughout the film, he acts as right hand to Gerza, barking orders at Nikolai, guarding Stana, even maiming her himself at times, and making sure this torturous process goes unhindered. Alexei is quite possibly Stana's biggest obstacle as far as proving her worth is concerned.



Devi Khajishvili is a Georgian actor born to the family of Nodar Khajishvili a Shotokan Karate Master and Nana Khajishvili a piano teacher. He is of a Georgian(Paternal side) and Russian, Ukrainian, Spanish and Iranian descent from his maternal grandparents. He is a master martial artist, a musician, a Texas Tech graduate and lastly but not least, a formidable actor. Once he stepped foot into the audition room, the filmmakers were hooked on his stature, confidence and raw talent. ""You are ALEXEI!"" exclaimed director Donavan Clark. His real life military and Soviet knowledge has won him the role over some pretty impressive efforts from other actors. We cannot wait to see how this man will electrify the screen as the ruthless ex-military, ex-mercenary, turned terrorist.





CHECKOV NIKOLAI
The Albanian born Nikolai was a terrible child, growing up to be the scum of the Russian underworld. One day he bit off more than he can chew and ended up being indebted and eventually owned by Gerza. Gerza has made Nikolai suffer and has broken him in the same fashion that they attempt to break Stana, he is a pitbull to both Vladamir and Gerza, performing whatever inhuman tasks are asked of him which are naturally torture and mayhem.










Greg Pierot is known for his work on Sweethearts of the Galaxy(2013) and Ninja Apocalypse (2014). Rare in most actors, Greg likes to play to his strengths which are tormented, shady, evil characters. He was immediately hooked on the script once his colleague Donavan Clark showed it to him and the character of Nikolai immediately jumped out at him. Coincidentally, his work in the audition room as a line feeder got the attention of his director and was easily cast  as the maniacal villain. He very much looks forward to the brutal physicality that the role demands and is up for the challenge of bringing this man to life. He is in love with this career defining role and will push harder than ever to be faithful to his director's intentions. 
BILLY HOLDEN
Billy Holden was once a famed local reporter, then catching a big break with a national network but ultimately leading him to the sharks. He was kidnapped after a journalism tour in Eastern Europe went sour and most of his partners were killed. When we first see him he's been imprisoned for just a few days. He's scared and confused. The only reason he'd been kept alive- to become the subject of the faceless woman's final test.


Justin Phillip Vanden Heuvel was born in a small town in Ohio, but grew up in Central Florida. Justin studied Theatre Performance at Florida Southern College and then attended Wayne State University for graduate studies in Acting. In 2009, he studied abroad at Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre School, the home of the original ""method acting"". His film debut was in the 2012 indie film 'Little Shadows', wherein he starred as sensitive ghost-hunter & photographer, Jack Alva. In 2014 he co-starred in 'The Brittany Murphy Story' with Eric Petersen and Amanda Fuller. Justin came to director Donavan Clark, a man he had once met before on a baseball feature entitled ""Undrafted"", after hearing of his casting call. Even without this bias, Justin wowed Donavan as well as Greg Peirot with his sympathetic and panicked take on Billy Holden. It took only a short meeting to finally come to the conclusion that Justin was not only the best choice but the only true choice for this tragic role.

The Crew






If you donate to this campaign, you will not only be aiding my career and my desire for storytelling but you will also be contributing to the skilled men and women that have agreed to be my crew for this film, some of which have already donated their time helping me shoot promotional materials. If my goal is met, I can pay them what they deserve, even hire more staff and make this film even better. Together, we can make Wednesday and the rest of this series possible!

I have gathered some of the most talented individuals I can find to bring this film and the rest of the series to life and I am still on the hunt for the freshest talent behind the camera to further improve the quality that Wednesday and every following title deserves!













  
So here's the deal...
We aim to raise $10,000, most of this (roughly $6,000) will go straight to the two day shoot to be scheduled later this year. As it states in the video, 10% of what we raise will be collected and donated to a number of Syrian refugee charities. The remaining $2,000 will go towards post production, distribution, festivals, and any other added  extra expense that may rear its ugly head. 

This is amount is just enough to get this first film going, if more is raised, we will keep it and factor it into the next installment to be shot next year! 
SO LET'S DO THIS!!!

<p> Hi to all! If you're a fan of intellectual, controversial, wit based dramedy and you're a recovering romantic, you may be our target audience.

<div>

After his director has an unfortunate medical crisis, with recurring
mediocre reviews, Jack is forced to push forward as the Creative director of
the Asteria Theatre. His only option to bring potential new life to the
theatre, is to hire the only guy he trusts to do the play justice and asking
the actors Ex to direct! If this isn't already a large enough ticking time
bomb, he hires a young inexperienced teen idol (with a following and ego to
boot) in order to appease the board and raise the theatre's profile. With a
bunch of motley characters, it could be the best show ever... or a complete
disaster.     </div><div>

<p>We believe that the most important thing in making something great, is the people behind it!  Although we're in an age where technology is readily available, nothing special can be created without the right professionals. This is why the largest percentage in our budget is for employment of cast &amp; crew. While we can't afford to pay huge amounts, for those who will be working regularly on the set, we want them to feel respected and able to cover their basic costs. For anyone who is kind enough to help us for less, we also wish to make sure there is a healthy and rounded daily catering service for all. Luckily a number of our crew come with some fantastic equipment, which helps us cut down on those costs. Even then, in order to show just how good they are, there are a number of things the technical side of the team will need. That is why equipment covers the second largest percentage of our graph. After that we will be putting money towards locations. We will be using as many local businesses as possible to help support things like local theatre, but they do also have costs. While we hope they can be flexible with us, we will have to make sure they are at no financial loss by welcoming us to film in their establishments. Then there is post-production, because all of our hard work will come to nothing if it is not skillfully finished. Finally, of course, Insurance! We want to make sure that everyone enjoys working on set and health and safety should never be something our people should worry about. Words &amp; Actions is a production that is looking to use resources carefully and put talented people to work and continue to do what they love... entertain.<br/><br/></p>

mediocre reviews, Jack is forced to push forward as the Creative director of
the Asteria Theatre. His only option to bring potential new life to the
theatre, is to hire the only guy he trusts to do the play justice and asking
the actors Ex to direct! If this isn't already a large enough ticking time
bomb, he hires a young inexperienced teen idol (with a following and ego to
boot) in order to appease the board and raise the theatre's profile. With a
bunch of motley characters, it could be the best show ever... or a complete
disaster.     

Where will the money be used?


We believe that the most important thing in making something great, is the people behind it!  Although we're in an age where technology is readily available, nothing special can be created without the right professionals. This is why the largest percentage in our budget is for employment of cast & crew. While we can't afford to pay huge amounts, for those who will be working regularly on the set, we want them to feel respected and able to cover their basic costs. For anyone who is kind enough to help us for less, we also wish to make sure there is a healthy and rounded daily catering service for all. Luckily a number of our crew come with some fantastic equipment, which helps us cut down on those costs. Even then, in order to show just how good they are, there are a number of things the technical side of the team will need. That is why equipment covers the second largest percentage of our graph. After that we will be putting money towards locations. We will be using as many local businesses as possible to help support things like local theatre, but they do also have costs. While we hope they can be flexible with us, we will have to make sure they are at no financial loss by welcoming us to film in their establishments. Then there is post-production, because all of our hard work will come to nothing if it is not skillfully finished. Finally, of course, Insurance! We want to make sure that everyone enjoys working on set and health and safety should never be something our people should worry about. Words & Actions is a production that is looking to use resources carefully and put talented people to work and continue to do what they love... entertain.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This is the story of man’s struggle to stay afloat in a sea of circumstances that seek to drown his every move. We glimpse 48 hours into the life of a taxi driver named Sabal. Sacrifice bleeds from his soul as he grapples with dynamics of love, power, and the search for purpose. Sabal is destitute as he fights to keep his family alive. He promised his wife they’d make a new life together before his father became delirious and dependent; He’s desperate to escape an endless cycle. When a mysterious fare takes him to a world he’s never experienced, lust tests his integrity. Ultimately, Sabal must choose between his family and carnality.</p>

<p>How would a single tree falling in the rainforest bring together a businessman from Michigan, a Russian journalist, and a DJ from a little town in the Amazon? It was a very special tree, and a very big story.</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>A giant red Cumaru tree had fallen and ripped a giant gaping hole in the dense dark rainforest canopy owned by Rick, the American businessman. Although he could have procured the same amount of wood at a much cheaper cost, Rick had a the crazy idea to harvest the timber from this tree so deep in the  forest, and do it without knocking down any other trees in the process. This was to be quite a challenge, as nearly everything had to be done by hand and on foot. His crew spent more than 5 weeks on site. FIVE WEEKS! That may give you some idea of the size of this red Cumaru tree. <p></p>
<p>This Cumaru tree ended up saving Rick's businesses in the US and Brazil, saved  the young Russian journalist,the DJ, allowed an Amazonian farm family to keep preserve their way of life, and kept families employed both in North and South America.</p>

Funding for this campaign will allow us to continue to develop our film project, with the goal of submitting the finished documentary to film festivals globally.

Challenges with bureaucracy and legislation in Brazil, costs etc.

This is a dramatic documentary story from the heart of the Amazon, the beginning of a friendship, and also a business partnership
How would a single tree falling in the rainforest bring together a businessman from Michigan, a Russian journalist, and a DJ from a little town in the Amazon? It was a very special tree, and a very big story.


A giant red Cumaru tree had fallen and ripped a giant gaping hole in the dense dark rainforest canopy owned by Rick, the American businessman. Although he could have procured the same amount of wood at a much cheaper cost, Rick had a the crazy idea to harvest the timber from this tree so deep in the  forest, and do it without knocking down any other trees in the process. This was to be quite a challenge, as nearly everything had to be done by hand and on foot. His crew spent more than 5 weeks on site. FIVE WEEKS! That may give you some idea of the size of this red Cumaru tree. 
This Cumaru tree ended up saving Rick's businesses in the US and Brazil, saved  the young Russian journalist,the DJ, allowed an Amazonian farm family to keep preserve their way of life, and kept families employed both in North and South America.

   What We Need & What You Get We are looking to raise Stage 1 funding: 
The dollar goes a bit further in Brazil where the bulk of the production work on this film will take place. Funds raised in this stage will go toward:

production and submission to film festivals. 
setting an interactive web-site that will tell about logging in the Amazon
launch a series of short videos about 3D Harvesting    
The Impact
 The telling of this story is important to understanding how economics, agribusiness,  humans, and environmentalism mix in the Amazon region.

<p>Imagine one day you come home to discover that you have been robbed. Everything you own has been stolen...and replaced with <i>exact replicas</i>.</p>
<p>It’s an eerie concept, that in it’s most simplified form, is the premise of the film “<b>Wavelength</b>”. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wavelength, is a short surreal mind-bender thriller about a young woman who has had just that happen to her. But the further she investigates, the stranger the situation becomes. Is she losing her mind? Is somebody hiding something?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a surreal film, the focus is largely on building a tone within the film that creates unease and tension. ""Wavelength"" is a mysterious and ominous world of oppressive power, droning synths, a crackling psychic energy which forms a disturbing puzzle in the viewers minds.  Something is terribly wrong, but like our main character, you are desperately trying to find out what it is.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">A successful white business owner, Chad takes pride in making corporate contributions that help people of color around the world. But Chad's true feelings surface when he's forced to interact as an equal with people of color. A former white college buddy moves into town and helps Chad finance a new enterprise.

</div></div>","Summary
A successful white business owner, Chad takes pride in making corporate contributions that help people of color around the world. But Chad's true feelings surface when he's forced to interact as an equal with people of color. A former white college buddy moves into town and helps Chad finance a new enterprise. Later, Chad's life is saved by an African American subordinate.  Which of the two will Chad and his family choose as their Thanksgiving guest?
The recent spate of police killings of unarmed African Americans and the responses of the black community, law enforcement, the media and Americans in general underscore that the racial divide in the US is as wide as ever.
Thanksgiving Guest shows how the racial divide in our post-Civil Rights society can be bridged -- one relationship across racial lines, one changed heart, at a time.
About the Writer/Producer
You could say this screenplay is 30-plus years in the
making. When I immigrated to the USA from Jamaica in the late 1970s, I assumed that only ‘bad’ people were racist, and that racism meant white people
doing disgusting acts like using racial epithets or burning crosses on the
lawns of people of color.
But I soon realized that ‘decent,’ ‘respectable’
people are also racist. Only, their displays of racism are subtle but equally
devastating as the overt acts. In short, racism in the US today is mostly about
exclusion -- from items as momentous as jobs or housing to situations as
mundane as exclusion from friendships.
I learned that
racism is the failure on the part of white people to make room in their hearts for
people of color. And this is what the short film, Thanksgiving Guest, is all about. 

This is my second screenplay. My first, a
full-length drama, is now being looked over by producers. When I'm not
working on a screenplay, I make other stuff up -- serving as a freelance copywriter. I've written a novel, ads, blogs, websites and more, and I've written and produced numerous commercials, documentaries and promotional videos. 
Your contribution -- of any amount -- will help us create a movie that is sure to help people of all walks of life bridge the racial divide and bring about racial harmony.
Cast and Crew
All 30 lead and support actors and actresses are now on board. Cast members have acted in numerous independent films as well as TV shows like Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D. and Empire. The DP (director of photography) has several award-winning films to his credit.
 What We Need and What You'll Get


We need $45,000 to bring this concept to reality. The chart above shows how the money will be spent. To show you how much we appreciate your contribution -- and to give you something to remember us by -- we're giving you some exciting rewards (right) in exchange for your gift. 
    Impact The timing of this film could never be better. The current debate about racism in the public arena has not happened in the US in a long time.
America needs Thanksgiving Guest. 
This family-friendly short film will be ideal as a teaching tool from junior high through college. Also, it will be shown at film festivals across the US and hopefully overseas as well. And we would be absolutely delighted if Thanksgiving Guest were to be picked up by a distributor.   
    Risks & Challenges Although producing the movie this fall involves several risks and challenges, I am confident they can be overcome.
Securing the locations for the shoot is a big challenge. Filmmakers who have made movies here in the Midwest have all said that people readily consent to their locations being used. So I am anticipating good success lining up the locations.

Raising the money needed is without question the biggest challenge. The budget of $45,000 is a minimum needed to produce the top-notch, visually impacting film the script calls for. We need your support to help us reach the goal. Any amount you give will be appreciated. Thanks.
    Other Ways You Can Help Whether or not you contribute, you can help us meet the goal by asking your friends and acquaintances who care about social justice to support the film.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Our story is one that aligns with
those of our ancestors. To leave home and journey to new lands in search of
something greater. Why are we doing this? Because we hope for a better,
brighter, happier future. </p>
<p>Our film will be a catalogue of our
journey to find true happiness and interviews with people we meet along the
way. We want to find what it is that makes people happy. We're going to talk to
people who have first-hand experiences with depression and happiness, as well
as those who study it. We're going to get real with them.</p>
<p>Depression has seriously plagued the
last three generations of Americans. What is the underlying theme of our
culture that makes it so? We want to discover our cultural perception of
happiness and deconstruct this perception that leaves so many feeling empty.</p>
<p>We've personally gone through
bouts of depression. We've felt isolated, sad, and hopeless. By experiencing
these lows, we've grown to live even greater highs. With nearly 20 million
people in America dealing with depression every single year, something has to
change. We want to shine the spotlight on this overwhelming issue and help
bring hope of happiness to as many people as possible.</p>

If you're anything like me, you left the theater fired up, ready to ride the road and probably set some stuff on fire. Running on the sound of war drums and sick iOTA guitar riffs, I decided I wanted to start a project inspired by this amazing series. I wanted to create a fashion story, right here on the east coast, full of hot warrior babes and mischievous warboys. It was just a silly idea at first but with overwhelming and unexpected support, it slowly started to take a life of its own. Now, backed by numerous volunteers, I am turning to you to help us fund this adventure. </p><br/><p>My name is Karina Antigua. I'm an up and coming, born and raised NYC photographer.

<li><p>The war tanker is the biggest bulk of our expenses. Right now, the crew (with models, styling, production, and assistants) consists of about 15 people. We need to get everyone out to our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mad-max-fashion-shoot/x/10943349#/gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">shoot location</a> in Jones State Park, Long Island. The only way we can do this is to rent a van. I've estimated that with gas, tolls, the rental fee and insurance, this is gonna cost us about $200-250 for the day. </p></li>
<li><p>Because we intend to shoot this under the blazing summer sun, we have to keep everyone hydrated and fed. We also need to get a tent and tables so that we don't spend the entire 8-10 hour shoot day under the hot sun. Tons of people have volunteered to help so far, so the least we can do is take care of them! I plan on putting aside about $150-200 of the funds to build our citadel.</p></li>
<li><p>The rest of the money would go directly to production: Making props, styling wardrobe, and any miscellaneous equipment we would need to make this happen. If there are any funds left over, I will also make a donation to the Jones State Park to help them with their efforts in wildlife conservation.</p></li>
</ul><p>The more money we raise, the bigger the production will become. 100% of the money raised here, will be put into the shoot one way or another.

<div><br/></div> <p>Hello my name is Malcolm Tan. I am a Singaporean base in Shanghai. At present I am an TV commercials directors and cinematographers Agent. I used to be an Executive Producer of a production company here. I've produced a number of print advertisements<b> </b>as well as TVCs. </p>
<p>This short story is written by me, I have written about 5 to 10 short stories, some of them are still in the revision stage, while some are already in the process of scripting. </p>
<p>This is something very new in the market, combining two very huge taboos in Asia, paranormal and homosexuality. I intend to make this a 40mins film and this is very important to me as it may potentially jump start my directing career for short films and feature films in the future. </p>

<p>I was brought up in a pretty awesome family with very strong religious background. But rest assured this film is not religious nor even related.

<p>This film is unique, I intend to make a few versions, Chinese language, English, the two biggest market, but I can also tap into Korean and Japanese, fairly easily.

<p>Just 2 weeks ago, I sort of rescued a cute little 2 months old Samoy which was abandoned by the owner because little puppy is sick. We (my partner and I) named him Benji. Little Benji was then rushed to the vet and diagnosed Canine Distemper Virus. We visited him daily and his condition went from bad to worst. Little Benji was undergoing a week of treatment but sadly, he didn't make it. We were actually hopefully that he'll recover and planned to house him after his recovery and to make our apartment more puppy friendly. We have a golden retriever too, her name is Mia. Mia was quite OK with little Benji, and we thought we could have a family together where little Benji will be safe from harm, just like Mia, I adopted her at 2 years old. Of course, this is not part of the pitch, I just want to share that really... in the event that this project didn't move as expected, these monies will go to the puppies in need and the old folks who needs daily basic necessities like tooth brushes, clothing, basic food and seasonal clothing. </p>

</div><div> <p>I love writing horror/paranormal stories, some are based on real facts and some are just expanded from personal experiences. I'd like to express my thoughts and ideas of the other world living in together in our existing space. Normal people don't see the spirits and ghosts don't mean they don't exist. I'll have to say the movie 'Interstellar' has pretty explained the existence of the parallel space, moreover, this parallel space does exist in the paranormal and our physical space as well. We just can't prove it as yet. If we ever meet in person, I'll share with you my personal experiences. </p>
<p>I do not have any track record directing films, but be sure I will be teaming up with a director whom I know for a long time and have been working together for several  TVC projects. He had a script all well written but it was taken, produced and screened recently. I saw the movie, and I had also read the script. I wish he was the one directing it, as it was really an amazing story based on true events. In return he had also read some of my stories and did express interest to work with me on my stories. He'll be my lead director and someone I could really learn some skills from. We're pretty cool as a team. </p>

<p>I believe the biggest challenge here is to get the right amount of money where every single crew involve in this project is paid according to their worth. But many times, as I have experienced, our worth is devalued by circumstances beyond our control. I'd like to pay the others their worth and time to work together as a team. If we have extra money, we share. If we don't, we share the risk together. </p>
<p>Having said that, I am pretty much well connected in this city and possibly able to pull in some favors to help making things work within the given budget. My EPs are also very experienced in the feature films production, I am sure they are able to pull some strings to help getting things done. The most important thing is, I won't compromise the quality of the film. I'd try raising more money again in an second attempt and combine the sums to make this film happen than to work around it and compromise the quality and core idea of the film. As I've mentioned earlier, there are many good movies and many more bad movies, I want my film and my team to stand within the 'Good Movie' category, and that's the most basic requirement I need to fulfill to the 'contributors' or 'investors' like yourself apart from my own personal objective.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 Hello my name is Malcolm Tan. I am a Singaporean base in Shanghai. At present I am an TV commercials directors and cinematographers Agent. I used to be an Executive Producer of a production company here. I've produced a number of print advertisements as well as TVCs. 
This short story is written by me, I have written about 5 to 10 short stories, some of them are still in the revision stage, while some are already in the process of scripting. 
This is something very new in the market, combining two very huge taboos in Asia, paranormal and homosexuality. I intend to make this a 40mins film and this is very important to me as it may potentially jump start my directing career for short films and feature films in the future. 
There are many good films in the market but there are many more bad ones - pardon my honesty. There are certain things about spirits and ghosts which normal people won't know, this is where I wish to take this opportunity to express it as 'realistic' as possible. 
As well, I also want to move away the stereotype of homosexuality. Hence combining these 2 huge genres is a great challenge to make it a really down to earth yet controversial film. 
This film is purely about performances of the main actor, whom will tell the story pretty much depends on his performances which will draw the attention of the viewers. At the end of the film, the twist will hit you hard. 
In this film, there are several messages I wish to portray, these messages are generally about teaching people about the theory of Cause and Effect. In fact all my stories have embedded some teachings from the wise one.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
I'm Hintea Dan Alexandru, a passionate technology enthusiast, developing software for a living for almost a decade now. One of my other passions is sport, especially tennis. When it comes to tennis, the only thing I like more than watching it, is playing it. And I play quite often, two to three times a week. I do either friendly matches with my colleagues or amateur tournaments.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Now, for any of these occasions I felt that it would be so awesome to have a tool or a system that persists the event. Something like the professional guys have, a scorekeeping system and all the post-analysis data and charts. Something I can look back into and see where I did good, where I did bad and where I should keep improving. Something I can share with others.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Therefore I started developing such a system and that's how <b><i>SKeepy</i></b> came to life.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Development is hard, and regardless of the effort I put into it, there's just not enough physical time to have the progress I would like.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
So that's why I decided to start this campaign, and hopefully, with <b><i>your help</i></b> I can allocate a lot more time to this project.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435622850/jxczidykgqakcxu3y7tu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The funding will mainly be used to cover the <b><i>development costs</i></b> of the system.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Some percent of it will go to infrastructure and marketing of the service, getting it known to the community and hopefully implement it as an official scoring system at some local sport clubs.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
To make things more interesting I defined a couple of perks which will grant you early access to platform and even get you involved in shaping up the future of it. Check them out.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
I opted for flexible funding because if the full goal is not reached, the partial funding can still be used to speed up the development process, even though it will surely delay the milestones.

</p></div>","Short Summary
Hi,

I'm Hintea Dan Alexandru, a passionate technology enthusiast, developing software for a living for almost a decade now. One of my other passions is sport, especially tennis. When it comes to tennis, the only thing I like more than watching it, is playing it. And I play quite often, two to three times a week. I do either friendly matches with my colleagues or amateur tournaments.


Now, for any of these occasions I felt that it would be so awesome to have a tool or a system that persists the event. Something like the professional guys have, a scorekeeping system and all the post-analysis data and charts. Something I can look back into and see where I did good, where I did bad and where I should keep improving. Something I can share with others.


Therefore I started developing such a system and that's how SKeepy came to life.


Development is hard, and regardless of the effort I put into it, there's just not enough physical time to have the progress I would like.


So that's why I decided to start this campaign, and hopefully, with your help I can allocate a lot more time to this project.




What We Need & What You Get




The funding will mainly be used to cover the development costs of the system.


Some percent of it will go to infrastructure and marketing of the service, getting it known to the community and hopefully implement it as an official scoring system at some local sport clubs.


To make things more interesting I defined a couple of perks which will grant you early access to platform and even get you involved in shaping up the future of it. Check them out.


I opted for flexible funding because if the full goal is not reached, the partial funding can still be used to speed up the development process, even though it will surely delay the milestones.




The Impact




As Lord Kelvin said: ""If you can not measure it, you can not improve it"". I personally believe in this because it has been proven time and again.


And this is exactly my vision for SKeepy. In the big picture, I see it as tool that helps you measure and improve yourself and by doing so it promotes a healthy living through sport!


I strongly believe that having actual insight into an activity, as opposed to simple assumptions, is a highly motivational factor.

Risks & Challenges

I am committed to this project and I really want it to see the daylight. So it's not a matter of if but rather of when. The only risk I see is the delay of its release if I will not get the required funding.

Other Ways You Can Help




I would highly appreciate any kind of help I can get from you guys, and I understand if you cannot make a donation right now, but please help me spread the word about my idea. Use Indiegogo share tools or simply mention any of the project's web presence on your social circles.

<h3>What is Route Your Tour?</h3> <p>Route Your Tour is a revolutionary new tool that will change the independent and major music industry for the better. There has never been a site with more features and tools in one place than this one. From routing a complete concert tour (includes finding venues and hotels in the area, getting directions, getting contact info and amenity information for each venue), to hiring a promoter or booking agent based off their ratings and reviews to do the work for you. As a musician, promoter, or booking agent, you'll never have to use another website again!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>The development of this site is extremely complicated and loaded with tons of features. That being said, we needed to hire the best in the business so that we can give you a product that you want, need, and deserve. After meticulously selecting the web development company to get us just that, we have come to a final price of $20,000. Only you can help us make that goal!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contributions can and will change the entire music industry for the better. We value any amount given to us to get us closer to our goal. Without you, this amazing new tool wouldn't be a possibility. And for that, we thank you ahead of time for all your help. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Challenges</h3> <p> Our biggest challenge going into this will be making sure that we dedicate the majority of our time guaranteeing the venue database is accurate and constantly growing. We want zero venues left off the map. With over 3000 major venues accurately spanned across the entire globe in our database, we are off to a great start!</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<div>If we go above and beyond our goal, that give us the opportunity to do so much more! It provides us with the funds to create a newly designed and dedicated app for iOS and Android, purchase dedicated servers for faster performance and better reliability, and continue to add newly suggested features as beta testing continues!</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you are unable to contribute funds for the site, we understand. But there are others way you can help!

<p>Right now there are thousands of women in Europe who are trapped in sexual exploitation. Many are victims of human trafficking. They are forced to prostitute themselves on the streets, in brothels or wherever else their pimps and captors demand. Each day and night is a chaotic nightmare as they are bought and abused for the purpose of satisfying sexual lust. It is a harsh existence of verbal, physical, emotional and sexual abuse. These women live without a sense of hope or belief that they can be free.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439995020/ff68nvhmr8qc7t7vek4l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The European Freedom Network and Project Hannah (Trans World Radio) believe that there is hope. Thankfully there are women who have been freed from this type of life and have found healing and restoration. We have connected with some of these women and collected their stories in order that they can be shared with those women who are still trapped in sexual exploitation. </p>
<p>The Hidden Treasures Initiative is an audio intervention tool that can be used by EFN partners who are working directly with abused and exploited women. We are producing a series of 10 audio episodes based on real life stories about women who have not only encountered the brutal realities of being trafficked and exploited but have also found hope, freedom and healing.</p>
<p>The goal is to produce and distribute these stories on secure mp3 players and other media formats to trafficked and exploited women all across Europe. These stories will offer hope, advice and comfort to those women who want a new life but don't believe it is possible. We are currently working on an English version which will then serve as the blueprint for multiple other languages including Romanian, Hungarian, Russian, Bulgarian, Czech and  more.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>What We've Done</h3> <p>This is a joint project between EFN and Project Hannah. Over the last two years we have already completed some important stages in the project including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishment of an HTI working group with members of EFN and Project Hannah</li>
<li>Collection of real life stories from women who have come out of trafficking and sexual exploitation and who have gone through a healing and restoration process</li>
<li>Outlined the strategic nature of the project including the number of audio episodes and the focus of each episode</li>
<li>Written 10 dramatized versions of the stories that have been collected. This was done by professional writers for audio content</li>
<li>Piloted different versions of the audio episodes with EFN partners and the women they serve</li>

<li>Decided upon language groups and media distribution methods</li>
<li>Identified a producer, voice actors and a studio to record the sessions in.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are now in the final stages of the production process. We have finished scripts, a producer and voice actors. <b>What we need now is the finances to go forward with the project</b>. The money raised will go towards the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring a professional producer, production crew, voice actors and studio to record and produce the 10 HTI episodes in English ($7500)</li>
<li>Purchase an initial batch of 100 mp3 players for use by our EFN partners ($1500)</li>

<p>Everyday exploited women see and hear how worthless they are from their pimps and the men who abuse them. They are told that the only thing they are good for is sexual pleasure. These are women from all over Europe and the world who at one point had dreams of a different future. HTI wants to restore hope and dignity to them by being a voice of love and peace.</p>
<p>In the midst of a hectic day or after a brutal night, women can listen in solitude to stories of healing and restoration. They can listen to a message of hope and freedom in the audio episodes and soothing music. They can be told that they are valuable and that there is more to their lives than what their traffickers, pimps and abusers tell them.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Working with trafficked and exploited women is a long and difficult process. We know that one audio tool can not change a woman's situation by itself. The bridge to freedom requires many people and partners who are willing to walk the journey from prevention, intervention, medical assistance, legal help, recovery, education and restoration. HTI is one step in that process but an important one.</p>
<p>Our partners who do intervention work understand that the road to freedom is not easy. Often they will not have long talk with women. Many times women that they are building a relationship with can suddenly disappear or be trafficked to a new destination. HTI is an important tool that our partners can use to ensure that the message of hope and freedom stays with the women, no matter where they are or how long they can speak with them.<br/></p>
<p>We understand that distributing mp3 players with audio episodes and music can be risky. They can be confiscated by pimps, lost or stolen. The women themselves may only listen to the episodes once and then choose not to use them again. However, the risk is worth it when we consider that the relative cost of one mp3 is approximately $10. Our partners know that this is a worthwhile cost and investment in the journey to freedom.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the contextualization and translation of the episodes for multiple languages. Many of the women do not speak English which makes translation a necessity. We have identified our top five target languages and will develop more as the finances become available. Both EFN and Project Hannah have a wide network of partners who work in these languages. Project Hannah produces audio episodes in multiple language formats and is able to do the translation and production work as necessary.</p>

<p> <b>MUHAMMAD ALI- The Greatest</b></p>
<p>Muhammad Ali is considered one of the most popular people in history. The three time Heavyweight Boxing Champion was voted by Sports Illustrated as the Athlete of the Century. His star and popularity rose to an unprecedented level by his social stances and philanthropy throughout his athletic career and continuing to this day. Ali has also been a media magnet because of his colorful and brash personality       which made him a sight to see throughout his colossal career. </p>
<p>Numerous people have been inspired by Ali to this day. Athletes and entertainers like Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Nas, R. Kelly, Katy Perry, Matt Lauer and many, many more. On Today.com Lauer said, 'This is perhaps the most famous man in the world, and he could easily still make it all about himself. And yet, he chooses to live his life in a way that makes all about others.' Ali's impact is the same over the entire world as he's travelled and fought in Tokyo, Russia, Africa, Phillipines, Ireland and more. Ali's magnificent selflessness is in addition to an incredible prowess and expertise demonstrated in the boxing ring and his magical presence. 'When I was young, Ali was the first athlete that you would turn on the television to see. He called himself pretty — and he was a handsome boy — and he could do tricks with his feet. He’d tell jokes, make people laugh; you couldn’t miss it. If you didn’t love him, you must have been jealous, which is the same thing as loving him. If I could have recorded him, I would have listened to him 24/7,' says George Foreman on Shortlist.com. Muhammad Ali has inspired the world.</p>
<p><b>The genesis of ALI SPEAKS!</b></p>
<p>The writer and director Eddie Goines is a former NFL football player that is now an award winning writer and actor in Los Angeles. Goines has always been inspired by Ali. He's loved Ali as an incredible and beautiful athlete, a captivating entertainer, and his social relevance in all of society. Goines wanted to salute the legendary Ali and made the short film ‘ALI SPEAKS!’ which was honored at the Muhammad Ali Center in 2013 during their annual Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Celebrities such as former undisputed World Boxing Champion Lennox Lewis have lauded it on social media. </span></p>

Creator- Eddie Goines
Eddie Goines is an award winning 
actor/writer who currently stars in 'The Coalition' on Showtime/Netflix. Goines has worked extensively in television, and is known all over the world for his lead
 role in Beyonce's 'If I Were A Boy. He's written three films accepted 
into Academy Award qualifying film festivals. In addition to those 
films, Goines' short film 'ALI SPEAKS!' about the great Muhammad Ali was
 honored by the Muhammad Ali Center two years ago.  Goines is an award winning actor for his lead role in the hit web series 'Celeste Bright,' and recently became an award winning writer for penning his romantic holiday drama '12 Days of Christmas.' He also has had principle roles in projects working with Tyler 
Perry, Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Whoopi Goldberg and many more 
in his ascent to being one of the top upcoming talents in the industry.  But none of these things are what truly define who Eddie Goines is. Who he is, is a relentless major talent who's tenacity and drive have him unequivocally focused on moving the world like all of the giants who have inspired him such as Michael Jackson, Mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela and of course Muhammad Ali along with many more. With Goines teaming with Moore and Hill, 'ALI SPEAKS!' is a can't miss hit.

WAIT!!! What if you don't raise all of the money, what's going to happen to our donations?
My ideal goal is to raise $300,000.  However if that number is not reached, the film is going to be made no matter what in 2016. That's for sure! So if we can't get the 300 then I'm just going to push through investors, celebrities etc to get more money and make the film. I made the 6 min short film for $76 so I can make a buck stretch. All I can say is that I'm going to and HAVE to get the film made. And whatever donation is given, I'll flag your donation personally and track it for you and let you know or even document how it was used in the making of the film. But there's no stopping this train. We're going to make an epic film.

Film has always been a passion of mine, and one that have I pursued for years. I graduated from Ball State University with a degree in video production, and moved to Austin, Texas to find that dream. It's been tough down here, but I've managed to get by working on a variety of projects for other people. </p>

<p>I told myself and everyone else through college that I never wanted to do a regular horror movie. Everyone was doing zombies/aliens/etc and I found it all tremendously dull. I didn't want to make anything that didn't mean something to me, and did something different. </p>
<p>Well now, that project has arrived. What Will Come is a horror short that I have written that I think does rise above your typical horror story. Not only do I want to be able to showcase my own talents in writing and directing, but I also want to highlight the skills and abilities of everyone else on my team.</p>
<p>What Will Come is a story about a homeless man who ekes out an existence in the wild hills of Texas; scavenging what he can and selling his art on a street corner downtown. He surrounds his camp with crosses to ward off something he thinks is in the woods, something that stalks and hides within the thick growth. He's alone and surrounded, that is, until a near-mute woman appears in his camp...<br/></p>
<p>I believe that everyone, from the production assistant to the director, has an important part to play in any production. I l want to produce a film that everyone involved can point to and say that they're proud of what they did. </p>
<p>But to make that dream a reality, I need your support to make this happen.</p>
<p>Every dollar that is received will go straight into the production, providing supplies, food, and props for the project. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Producing films is not a cheap endeavor, there are a multitude of costs that come with it, more than I can personally finance.</p>
<p>The funds that are raised will be going to two main areas: production materials &amp; equipment, and production food &amp; miscellaneous supplies. </p>
<p>The crew members and actors are generously donating their time (and in some cases, equipment) to the production, and in return I need to be able to provide them with food and snacks during the production, as well as reimburse for transportation costs. </p>
<p>Specifically, we are planning for 3 production days, which will involve at least 4-6 meals for a group of ~10 people. That's a lot of food!</p>
<p>Secondly, there will be costs associated with materials and equipment needed to make this film a reality. There are props to buy and/or build, as well as a monster puppet to make. Much of the gear, such as cameras, sound equipment, etc, are being provided by the crew members themselves, but we don't have everything. We will need makeup for the actors, and we are planning on making a fully practical monster to be used. No CGI! </p>

The monster budget will have to be cut back, and the crew might have to survive on lentil soup. The big money drain on the production design is the creature, which means that the less money we get the less scary he's going to look. The big fear is him dropping into the ""comically bad looking"" territory, and that is a possibility if our funding is too far short.</p>
<p>A lack of funding might also impact how much of the actor/crew expenses can be reimbursed. We're hoping for 100% reimbursement right now (with all funds) but that could fall short, making crew member have to pay out of pocket to work on this production.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Every donation counts, no matter how small. Everyone involved with this project is trying to make it in the production world. And in the production world, what counts is experience and the quality of your past projects. </div>
<div>The field is more competitive than ever, and we all need to do something amazing to stand out. This is a chance to do that.   </div>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">You are a Shifter. A rare breed of human that has the ability to slip through time at will. But this ability does not come without a cost. Your kind has drawn the interest of an untouchable crime boss known only as Gary. He wishes to not only control the city, but the city today, tomorrow, and yesterday. That’s where you come in; an indentured servant, forced into a life of non-linear crime.

<h3>GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW:</h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You play as one of four Shifters, humans with the ability to travel through time. Having fallen on hard times, each Shifter has ended up in the employ of the notorious crime boss, Gary. Each turn, you move forward through time, naturally; attempting to collect guns, drugs, technology, and credits needed to fulfill smuggling contracts for your boss. But, to make things interesting, you can also move forward and backward, skipping entire years at a time to take advantage of the going rates and demand of other years. You can play against the stock market and withdraw money from interest bearing accounts. However, each time you shift through time, you must draw an Event card that determines the effects that your shift has had on the timeline. It may lead to riches, or sabotage your plans. Maybe your opponents will fall into good fortune. Subterfuge gives you one time advantages to get ahead of your fellow Shifters. As time marches on, you never know when you might run into Gary; will he give you a pat on the back, or a kick in the teeth? Use time as a resource to complete your contracts before the other Shifters. <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.thegamecrafter.com/1463847883/9%20Years%20To%20Yesterday%20-%20Rules.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.thegamecrafter.com/1463847883/9%20Years%20To%20Yesterday%20-%20Rules.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">9 Years to Yesterday - Rules</a></span>

</h3> <p>About four years ago, I participated in a ""game jam,"" game design competition. The theme image provided was a cityscape that was repeated in a kaleidoscope-like way. Some early game concepts revolved around time travel, however, we ultimately went in a different direction. Fast forward to fall of 2015 when I was playing a variety of games with some friends. I hadn't thought about my game since the jam but suddenly, those early concepts rapidly began to crystallize into what became ""9 Years to Yesterday.""  </p>

</h3></span></div>The goal of this campaign is perhaps a little different than some other game crowdfunding campaigns. This project started out as a personal challenge, but I am extremely happy with the way the game turned out and want to make it available to as many people as possible. On the other hand, I am not looking to start a side business, contract with a company in China and produce 1500+ copies.The game is finished and available for purchase through a US based, print-on-demand manufacturer that provides an excellent final product including a folding board, cards, laser cut tokens, full color box and other printed and non-printed components. <a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/9-years-to-yesterday1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/9-years-to-yesterday1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">9 Years to Yesterday - Online Shop</a>
</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The main goal of this campaign is to raise a seed fund so that I can manufacture a small inventory to send out for reviews, place in local game shops, and get the word out. Ideally, through many small contributions of $1-5 this campaign can reach that goal. The goal of $1500 will allow me to manufacture about 20 copies of the game.</span><br/>

</div><div> <p>There are two types of funding levels. </p>
<p>One is a small donation. You're not ""buying"" anything, but you're supporting independent game development and helping with that seed goal. Any amount helps to get me closer to my goal of manufacturing a small inventory.

You are a Shifter. A rare breed of human that has the ability to slip through time at will. But this ability does not come without a cost. Your kind has drawn the interest of an untouchable crime boss known only as Gary. He wishes to not only control the city, but the city today, tomorrow, and yesterday. That’s where you come in; an indentured servant, forced into a life of non-linear crime. You can’t claim to dislike the rewards of your efforts, but the risks involved have you looking for an exit strategy - a normal life. Not to seem unreasonable, Gary has proposed a game; he is willing to release one of his loyal Shifters upon completion of one last job. 

You must travel through time to leverage the going rate for Contraband, level of Technological Innovation, and the Financial health of each year to complete your Contracts. Standard Contracts require the completion of smaller smuggling jobs and financial transactions. Each Shifter has their own set of knowledge and skills necessary to complete larger, more complicated Release Contracts. Impress Gary, and you are free to live out the rest of your life as you choose. Check out www.9yearsgame.com




GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW:
You play as one of four Shifters, humans with the ability to travel through time. Having fallen on hard times, each Shifter has ended up in the employ of the notorious crime boss, Gary. Each turn, you move forward through time, naturally; attempting to collect guns, drugs, technology, and credits needed to fulfill smuggling contracts for your boss. But, to make things interesting, you can also move forward and backward, skipping entire years at a time to take advantage of the going rates and demand of other years. You can play against the stock market and withdraw money from interest bearing accounts. However, each time you shift through time, you must draw an Event card that determines the effects that your shift has had on the timeline. It may lead to riches, or sabotage your plans. Maybe your opponents will fall into good fortune. Subterfuge gives you one time advantages to get ahead of your fellow Shifters. As time marches on, you never know when you might run into Gary; will he give you a pat on the back, or a kick in the teeth? Use time as a resource to complete your contracts before the other Shifters. 9 Years to Yesterday - Rules



The Story:
 About four years ago, I participated in a ""game jam,"" game design competition. The theme image provided was a cityscape that was repeated in a kaleidoscope-like way. Some early game concepts revolved around time travel, however, we ultimately went in a different direction. Fast forward to fall of 2015 when I was playing a variety of games with some friends. I hadn't thought about my game since the jam but suddenly, those early concepts rapidly began to crystallize into what became ""9 Years to Yesterday.""  
   



Goals:
The goal of this campaign is perhaps a little different than some other game crowdfunding campaigns. This project started out as a personal challenge, but I am extremely happy with the way the game turned out and want to make it available to as many people as possible. On the other hand, I am not looking to start a side business, contract with a company in China and produce 1500+ copies.The game is finished and available for purchase through a US based, print-on-demand manufacturer that provides an excellent final product including a folding board, cards, laser cut tokens, full color box and other printed and non-printed components. 9 Years to Yesterday - Online Shop

The main goal of this campaign is to raise a seed fund so that I can manufacture a small inventory to send out for reviews, place in local game shops, and get the word out. Ideally, through many small contributions of $1-5 this campaign can reach that goal. The goal of $1500 will allow me to manufacture about 20 copies of the game.





How You Can Help:
 There are two types of funding levels. 
One is a small donation. You're not ""buying"" anything, but you're supporting independent game development and helping with that seed goal. Any amount helps to get me closer to my goal of manufacturing a small inventory. You will receive updates on future group sale campaigns conducted directly by the manufacturer where the game will be available at a discounted price. But, the group sales require an initial outlay of money for reviews, testing, etc. (and that is where the small donations make a big dent).
The second option is a bigger donation, but with the bonus of receiving a copy of the game. With this option, the game is sold at cost, but it adds quantity to the order, making it more cost effective to manufacture. The bigger the order, the cheaper the games. So as quantity increases, more of your contribution becomes a donation. It's kind of a feedback loop.There are a few packages available, so check out the perk descriptions.
Risks & Challenges
 Really, this campaign has no risks. The game is ready to go. If the project isn't fully funded, but you pledge an amount that includes a  copy of the game as a perk, you WILL still get the game.

For dansk rul ned.Fyrir íslensku skrolla niður.



Kalle has a problem. He cheated on his girlfriend and caught the STD Clamydia.He has infected his girlfriend but she does not know......What should he do?




Kalle faces a moral decision. Let her know, or find a way to give her the medicine without her finding out. Kalle confides in his friends Thomas, Markus and Carl to find a solution. Meantime, Ida has already developed the symptoms and has booked a visit to her doctor. She asks Kalle to go with her. 
Should he reveal the truth, lie, or run away from the situation knowing that the visit to the doctor will reveal the truth. What Kalle does not know is that the truth might not be what it seems. 



Why we want to make the film and why we want your help.
We got the idea for short film, Chlamydia when sitting in our local bar listening to a friends story describing a similar situation. We were struck by the opportunity to discuss a moral issue and how it intersects with fate and how life often delivers more surprises than certainties.The story led to brainstorm, a script, a production plan and now to this page and the request for support. We are young artists studying passionately at Denmarks leading theatre school and would truly appreciate your financial support within the following areas: 


Film equpment 


Food on set


Car rental


Travel cost

Wardrobe and makeup

Who are we ?

We are a team of three filmmakers and trained actors from Denmark with a passion for storytelling on the big screen. We have put our heads together to create a project that is brought to life by our common love of film and different skills.
Production team is made up of  Oliver V. Franck, Thor Johnson and Elizabeth Rand Quaade.
We have brought together a strong team of trained actors that are dedicated to help us bring the project to life.

Dansk:Kalle er landet i en problematisk situation, da han har været kæresten Ida utro med Simone fra studiet.









Kalle har været hos lægen og fået konstateret Klamydia, som han frygter at han har videregivet til kæresten Ida.
I hans kamp om at bevare sit forhold til Ida uden at hun finder ud af sanheden, betror Kalle sig til vennerne Thomas, Markus og Carl. Han beskriver situationen og fortæller hvordan han i forskellige scenarier, har forsøgt at få Ida til at indtage en pille (antibiotika).
Ida som er uvidende om situation, er selv begyndt at mærke symptomer. Dagen efter skal Ida til lægen for at blive undersøgt.
Kalle tager med til lægen, og beslutter sig for at fortælle sanheden. 
Hvorfor laver vi denne film og hvorfor har vi brug for jeres hjælp


Vi fik idéen til ”Klamydia”, da vi sad på vores lokale cafe, og en af vores venner fortalte at han havde dummet sig. Han havde været sin kæreste utro og fået klamydia.
Vi drøftede emnet, og fik lyst til at skabe fokus om klamydia, og ikke mindst det at være utro. Vi er vist alle enige om, at begge omstændigheder er uheldige på alle planer.
Vi blev helt opslugt af udfordringen, og begyndte straks at brainstorme på historien, og den tog hurtigt form. 
Vi syntes vores historie formår at give stof til eftertanke, og at vi får formidlet vores budskab på en kort og også humoristisk måde.
Vi brænder virkelig for at kunne realisere dette projekt, og for at det kan lykkes, har vi har brug for jeres hjælp i form at økonomisk støtte.
Vi skal blandt andet bruge udgifter til:



Leje af udstyr


Leje af bil


Forplejning på settet


Rejseudgifter

Kostumer og Makeup 

Hvem er vi?

Vi er tre unge filmskabere, Oliver V. Franck, Thor Johnson og Elizabeth Rand Quaade.
Vi er uddannede skuespillere fra Københavns Film og Teaterskole i Danmark, og vi lever og brænder for historiefortælling på det stor lærred. 
Vi tror af hele vores hjerte på dette projekt, og på at det kan blive vakt til live med vores fælles kærlighed til film, vores forskellige kompetencer, og ikke mindst jeres opbakning og støtte.
Vi har allerede fået samlet et stærkt hold af super dygtige uddannede skuespillere, og vi er mere end ”KLAR TIL OPTAGELSE”……


Íslenska:



Kalle er búin að koma sér í vandræði, hann hefur haldið framhjá Ídu kærustunni sinni með Simone úr skólanum.



Hann fór til  læknis og greindist með klamydíu, og nú hefur hann að sjálfsögðu smitað kærustuna sína Ídu
Í baráttu sinni til að halda sambandinu gangandi án þess að Ída komist að sannleikanum, leitar Kalle til vina sinna Thomas, Markus og Carl. Hann lýsir aðstæðum og segir að hann hafi reynt mismunandi aðferðir til að reyna að fá Ídu til að taka sýklalyf.
Ida sem eru ókunnugt um ástandið er farin að finna fyrir einkennum. Daginn eftir fer Ida sjálf til læknis til að vera skoðuð.
Kalle fer með henni og hefur ákveðið að segja henni sannleikann.

Við urðum strax hrifin af sögunni og byrjuðum að stinga uppá hugmyndum um hvernig hann gæti gefið henni sýklalif án þess að hún myndi fatta það.

<h3><b>An Online shop packed with Magical items!</b></h3>
<p>Finally, MRO has recognised through our 20+ years of practising the Craft that the current market has not met the needs of Magical Practitioners. There is no worse feeling buying from a shop that its staff is not trained to answer questions on the quality and the use of magical items. Even though, we would not say that all shop owners and staff fall in this category, through our experience we have understood that this is not uncommon as well. We would like to bridge that gap by creating an online shop packed with Magical items that we value and we have created and tested. In order to honour, all our community members who align with our cause to bring Magic to its rightful place and present it to all those who want to learn, either via text or video, we have decided in exchange of your donations to be the first who will receive our magical items as a token of our appreciation and gratitude for your help. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449774828/xkucokirwlseweuwbvxk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>We deeply believe that everything we do is a collective effort and the more people that align with our cause the easier it would be to manifest change, to Revive Magic in the Hearts and Minds of Modern People and to empower them to lead the lives that they want, to be wise, happy and harmonious with themselves and the world that surrounds them!</p>

<h2>
<b>Help Us Record
History!</b><br/>
</h2>We
are working to record the personal stories of Hungarian American immigrants who
came to the United States after the Revolution of 1956 and WWII. So far we have
completed 35 compelling interviews, and we’re working to push that number to 100 this year. But time is of the essence! <br/><br/><p>These immigrants are some of
the last to have personal memories of the Hungarian revolution and WWII –
stories that will be lost to future generations if they are not documented and
recorded. As a community, we need to make it a top priority to record their
stories for our children and our children's children. </p><p>Join the team with multimedia producer Andrea Lauer Rice and documentary filmmaker Réka Pigniczky! Together we can record history!</p>
<p><b><i>“As a historian I very much believe in history being preserved not just on paper and in writing, but visually and to the media, and so I think this is as important as writing a book...once I’m gone, this oral history will be gone.” </i></b></p><b><i>-
Katalin Kádár Lynn, Historian, DP<br/><br/></i></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452970633/v95tvhyzoglm6goxc6pt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Photo: Katalin Kádár Lynn, DP Generation, talks about the importance of Memory Project<br/><br/></i><b></b>
<div>
<h3><b>2016 is the Perfect Year!</b></h3>
<p>This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when the tiny
country of Hungary brought the Soviet Union to its knees when no one else
dared. The failed revolution sent 200,000 Hungarians fleeing across the
borders, including 35,000 who were taken in by the U.S. Even those who were
displaced persons (refugees of WWII) have vivid memories of 1956 and how it
affected their lives as new immigrants here.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>Why Are We Devoted to This Project? </b></h3>
<p>The two project founders, Andrea and Réka are the daughters of 1956-ers, but they each have different reasons that motivate them to take on this ambitious project. <br/></p>
<p>While Réka has won several awards for her movie ""Journey Home,"" which tells the moving story of her Father's role in the '56 Revolution, she never interviewed him herself. And now that he has passed away, the opportunity is lost. Through this project, she hopes to record other people's stories so that no one else will miss the opportunity to hear these stories in the words of the people who lived them. <br/></p>
<p>Andrea grew up hearing stories about 1956 from her mother and other family members who participated. But her challenge has always been finding ways to bridge the gap - building a bridge between Hungarians and Americans, between spouses and parents and children. She tries to find the answer to the question, how does one generation effectively pass on heritage and traditions to the next. <br/></p>
<p>While interviewing Éva Kisvarsányi in Sarasota, FL, Andrea and Réka met her daughter Erika. She had also grown up in a Hungarian American home, hearing about 1956 from a young age. She told them, ""Even though it didn't happen in my lifetime, 1956 had the single greatest impact on my life."" This is true for most children of '56-ers, and it is what motivates the creators of the Memory Project today.</p>
<p><i><b>""We're often concerned about getting the younger generation involved in Hungarian affairs. There is no better example than Andrea and Réka.

<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Lasting Influence of 1956</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>In
2015, Andrea and Réka joined forces to launch a community-wide initiative called the Memory Project. They traveled to six
different locations in the U.S. and Hungary and conducted 35 interviews with '56-ers and Displaced Persons – <b><i>none of
whom had ever told their stories on camera.</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In
each and every location, they were greeted enthusiastically by the community and invited
into people's homes to hear their personal stories, sometimes told through
tears. In some cases, people shared photo albums that had never before been seen or
original posters from 1956. In nearly every case,  Andrea and Réka were asked
- ""What took you so long to do this project?"" </p>
<p>The
first round of interviews, funded by The Hungary Initiatives
Foundation, can now be seen on the Memory Project’s <a href=""https://vimeo.com/channels/memoryproject"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Vimeo
Channel</span></a>. </p>
<p>After
Phase I was completed, Andrea and Réka knew that they must continue on their mission
to record as many interviews as possible to help celebrate and commemorate this
special anniversary year and also to help teach and reach the next generation
with these heroic personal narratives.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b>Participation is key – at any

<p>We
have set a goal of raising at least $30,000 from the Hungarian American community for this campaign. It will enable us to build on the momentum of Phase I by traveling to more locations within the U.S., filming, editing, and subtitling the interviews, most of which are more than an hour long. This will ensure that the project is professional, consistent and remains accessible to people everywhere. <br/></p>
<p>One reason we are so devoted to this
project is that it is time-sensitive. If we are able to accomplish our fundraising goals, we can continue recording the personal

<p>Because of the success of Phase I, there is already
quite a bit of interest in utilizing the interviews and project materials for
the upcoming 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations. So, we need to continue conducting new interviews in new locations as well as

<p><b>Are
you a non-profit?  </b></p>
<p>Yes, our fiscal sponsor, the Central
EU California Cultural Institute (CECI), is a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Contributions
to Memory Project are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. CECI’s tax
ID number is 46-4227145. </p>
<p>The Central European California Cultural Institute (CECI), a San 
Francisco-Budapest based NGO, organizes cultural exchange between the 
two regions, having started with a film festival and developing into a 
wide range of cultural events. For more information please see: <a href=""http://www.cecinitiative.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cecinitiative.org/</a><br/></p>
<p><b>How
can I get a tax deductible receipt?  </b></p>
<p>When you contribute, you will receive
an email from FirstGiving (Indiegogo’s nonprofit payments processor) confirming
your contribution. This email receipt can be used for tax deductible purposes.
For all contributions over $250, you will receive an official receipt for
tax-reporting purposes by email after the campaign ends.</p>
<p><b>How will the funds be used? </b></p>
<p>Any
donations to Memory Project through this campaign will be used so that the two
primary interviewers can travel to new locations to conduct interviews, edit
and subtitle those interviews, and to upload the roughly one hour long (often
more) stories. The Memory Project will also create a shorter interview
compilation trailer that can be used at 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations as well as educational materials.
Since we already have our equipment, and our Vimeo channel is up and running, <b>these funds will go directly to recording
and publishing more interviews.</b></p>
<p><b>Why
should I help? </b></p>
<p>For Phase I of our project we were
privileged to have the support of The Hungary Initiatives Foundation. As we
move into Phase II, we are readying proposals to expand our network of
supporters and funders. <b>But to sustain
this initiative for the critical anniversary year, we can’t take any time off</b>.
We need to get to work right away. For that we need your help during this short
burst 30-day campaign. </p>
<p>In addition, because this initiative is
for the long-term benefit of the Hungarian American community, we felt it was
important to fundraise partially from our own community, from the grass roots.
Once this campaign is successfully completed, we will work to further expand
our network of supporters and secure funding through individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>All donations, regardless of the
amount, help further our mission to create a living record of history and teach
the next generation. </p>

History!
We
are working to record the personal stories of Hungarian American immigrants who
came to the United States after the Revolution of 1956 and WWII. So far we have
completed 35 compelling interviews, and we’re working to push that number to 100 this year. But time is of the essence! These immigrants are some of
the last to have personal memories of the Hungarian revolution and WWII –
stories that will be lost to future generations if they are not documented and
recorded. As a community, we need to make it a top priority to record their
stories for our children and our children's children. Join the team with multimedia producer Andrea Lauer Rice and documentary filmmaker Réka Pigniczky! Together we can record history!
“As a historian I very much believe in history being preserved not just on paper and in writing, but visually and to the media, and so I think this is as important as writing a book...once I’m gone, this oral history will be gone.” -
Katalin Kádár Lynn, Historian, DPPhoto: Katalin Kádár Lynn, DP Generation, talks about the importance of Memory Project

2016 is the Perfect Year!
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when the tiny
country of Hungary brought the Soviet Union to its knees when no one else
dared. The failed revolution sent 200,000 Hungarians fleeing across the
borders, including 35,000 who were taken in by the U.S. Even those who were
displaced persons (refugees of WWII) have vivid memories of 1956 and how it
affected their lives as new immigrants here.



Why Are We Devoted to This Project? 
The two project founders, Andrea and Réka are the daughters of 1956-ers, but they each have different reasons that motivate them to take on this ambitious project. 
While Réka has won several awards for her movie ""Journey Home,"" which tells the moving story of her Father's role in the '56 Revolution, she never interviewed him herself. And now that he has passed away, the opportunity is lost. Through this project, she hopes to record other people's stories so that no one else will miss the opportunity to hear these stories in the words of the people who lived them. 
Andrea grew up hearing stories about 1956 from her mother and other family members who participated. But her challenge has always been finding ways to bridge the gap - building a bridge between Hungarians and Americans, between spouses and parents and children. She tries to find the answer to the question, how does one generation effectively pass on heritage and traditions to the next. 
While interviewing Éva Kisvarsányi in Sarasota, FL, Andrea and Réka met her daughter Erika. She had also grown up in a Hungarian American home, hearing about 1956 from a young age. She told them, ""Even though it didn't happen in my lifetime, 1956 had the single greatest impact on my life."" This is true for most children of '56-ers, and it is what motivates the creators of the Memory Project today.
""We're often concerned about getting the younger generation involved in Hungarian affairs. There is no better example than Andrea and Réka. I've been delighted to know them and to personally observe the various ways in which their dedication has enriched our American Hungarian world...We are eager to have them come to Chicago as one of the next Memory Project locations.""

Participation is key – at any

We
have set a goal of raising at least $30,000 from the Hungarian American community for this campaign.

Because of the success of Phase I, there is already

the upcoming 60th anniversary celebrations. So, we need to continue conducting new interviews in new locations as well as
creating educational resources and interview compilations for use in this special
anniversary year. Please help us reach our goal of raising a portion of our funding directly from the community.

She has an MBA from Goizueta Business School at Emory University and a BA in Journalism from Lehigh University.
Project MethodologyTo begin the daunting task of trying to interview as many '56-ers and DPs as possible in the community, Andrea and Réka researched the most effective oral history projects and video archives. They based much of their approach on the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, which has conducted approximately 52,000 interview testimonials with Holocaust survivors. They relied on their backgrounds as journalists and their knowledge of the Revolution of 1956 and the Hungarian American community to create a template of questions that they would consistently ask during each interview. They also have a small group of trusted advisers who provide guidance throughout the project.

To date, we have conducted 35 interviews in 6 locations with DPs and 1956-ers around the United States and in Hungary. We attended a number of festivals and community events to get the word out about the project and collect names for potential interview subjects. All video interviews have been edited and uploaded, with ten subtitled in English/Hungarian, to our Vimeo channel with a brief bio. We created a short trailer about the project which has been viewed by thousands of people both here and in Hungary.
We are ready to start Phase II, which will include new interviews in new locations and the creation of educational materials, based on the project, for the upcoming anniversary commemorations.
What Are the Future Plans for the Collection?
The Memory Project is an archive that is built to last. 
After we've recorded and archived 100 interviews, the Memory Project plans to partner with a reputable academic institution. We are currently in discussions with a handful of universities with expertise in this area to determine the best long-term home for the collection, in addition to a website accessible to the public at all times.

Francisco-Budapest based NGO, organizes cultural exchange between the 
two regions, having started with a film festival and developing into a 
wide range of cultural events. For more information please see: http://www.cecinitiative.org/
How
can I get a tax deductible receipt?  
When you contribute, you will receive
an email from FirstGiving (Indiegogo’s nonprofit payments processor) confirming
your contribution. This email receipt can be used for tax deductible purposes.
For all contributions over $250, you will receive an official receipt for
tax-reporting purposes by email after the campaign ends.
How will the funds be used? 
Any
donations to Memory Project through this campaign will be used so that the two
primary interviewers can travel to new locations to conduct interviews, edit
and subtitle those interviews, and to upload the roughly one hour long (often
more) stories. The Memory Project will also create a shorter interview
compilation trailer that can be used at 60th anniversary celebrations as well as educational materials.
Since we already have our equipment, and our Vimeo channel is up and running, these funds will go directly to recording
and publishing more interviews.
Why
should I help? 
For Phase I of our project we were
privileged to have the support of The Hungary Initiatives Foundation. As we
move into Phase II, we are readying proposals to expand our network of
supporters and funders. But to sustain
this initiative for the critical anniversary year, we can’t take any time off.
We need to get to work right away. For that we need your help during this short
burst 30-day campaign. 
In addition, because this initiative is
for the long-term benefit of the Hungarian American community, we felt it was
important to fundraise partially from our own community, from the grass roots.
Once this campaign is successfully completed, we will work to further expand
our network of supporters and secure funding through individuals and organizations.
All donations, regardless of the
amount, help further our mission to create a living record of history and teach
the next generation.

I donate from outside the USA?

What
payment methods do you accept? 
Indiegogo accepts all major credit

Large
Contributions - How can I make a contribution over $10,000? 
The nonprofit payment processor
(FirstGiving) that is handling the transactions for this campaign is able to

interested in making a large contribution through a wire transfer to
FirstGiving, please contact us at alauer@lauerlearning.com. We’ll connect you with a specialist

<h3>Fund the Foundation of Islam in the West Indies</h3>
<p>In the name of Allah Subhaana Wa Ta'aala, most benevolent, most magnanimous, most exalted.</p>
<p>As-salamu alaykum my dear brothers and sisters,</p>
<p>Islam has been in Saint Lucia since the ‘90s and has been growing at quite a rapid pace. We've been struggling to make ends within our current facility. The location cannot properly hold our congregation as most members have to sit outside during Jummah prayers. The heat outside can be so intense that one of our brothers actually suffered a near-heat stroke waiting to listen to the Khutbah outside.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438925318/tv7nmuilwdnzhknru75d.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Not Just About Faith, but About Giving Back and Sheltering</h4>
<p>We conduct blood drives and food drive runs monthly under the guidance of the local medical schools. We also serve as a local soup kitchen for those homeless who walk the main street and all those who are in need of food or shelter. Our facility not only caters to Muslims but to all those that are in need of aid. It provides a shelter for all those in need of it. In order to compensate for the growing local population becoming more aware of Islam, we need to upgrade our food storage and kitchen areas. At present, we only have a single faucet, no bathroom, no air conditioning, broken ceiling tiles, no proper divider between the sexes, and no windows in the current musallah facility and, <i>Inshallah</i>, are looking to build these areas in the creation of the new mosque.</p>

<h3>The Rapid Spread of Islam in the Caribbean</h3>
<p>The Saint Lucian community is a tight-knit one and the brothers and sisters here find love and unity through Islam, whether it be by helping their fellow locals through organized blood drives directed by the local medical schools or opening their doors for anyone to come in and enjoy a tasty meal. Our musallah is a place open to all, and provides assistance and guidance to many. We love one another and we hope that love can extend even further with your assistance. </p>
<p>We have 3–5 new converts every month in Saint Lucia, and when you compare that to the entire population of 170,000 people, that's a whole lot of people finding light in Islam. As such, we can't contain the new members of the congregation within such a small facility. According to Prof. Ilyas Ba Yunus, 75 percent of converts to Islam convert back to their original faiths after a period of time.This tends to be due to lack of support from the community around them and the hardships of properly adapting. With a more established Masjid and full-time Imam, we can ease the transitions for the many converts who come within our halls.</p>

<h3><i>Growing Numbers; Growing Thirst of Knowledge</i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The brothers and sisters here have reverted with the help of sources such as visiting Imams, senior members of the congregation, and Muslims from the American medical schools located here. The people of our congregation need a real learned Hafiz and Imam - an educator of Islam - to inform them of what is right and what is wrong according to proper fiqh and schooling.</p>
<p>With your assistance,we can guide and ease these people into the correct path of Islam and the appropriate way to live up to the Prophet's Sunnah. The hiring of an Imam is a much needed task to be accomplished, and the ilm/knowledge he will provide will help our congregation grow that much wiser, stronger, and unified. Some of the members of the congregation lack the proper vocalization of the Qur'an and will improperly recite it, skewering and misinterpreting the language of the Holy Book. With the assistance of an Imam we can host legitimate <i>Arabic classes</i> as well, which would allow for proper clarity. A large majority of our congregation is eager to see these classes come to actualization. With your funding, we can make these aspirations a reality.</p>
<p>The youth of the island also tend to partake in more reckless activities as the drug scene is rather widespread throughout the island. <i>Establishing a Sunday School </i>and a place where youth can gather would be a great way to avert them from dangerous behaviors. With the current musallah, this cannot happen, as the current location is farther away from the local schools and the max capacity for the building is quite small.

<p>We're
planning to shoot “What’s In a Fortune?” in April and we need to raise $2,000.
 We need money for craft services to be able to feed our cast and crew, we
need to be able to afford props, and we need to be able to compensate gas money
for those who are travelling cross-state for this production!</p>
<p>For the past three
years, I’ve been involved with about 30 films, in several different capacities.  As an Assistant Director, Script Supervisor,

<p>Abbey faces a crisis and
is worried about her fortune.  Tara feels
she has no fortune at all.  Colt thinks
his fortune is to get lucky.  Rex wants
to make a fortune off a pro football career. 
Nydia wants to make a fortune off ruining everyone else.</p>
<p>Jaden... just wants to base his life of off
what the fortune cookie says!</p>
<p>In fact, Jaden wants to
make this his New Year’s Resolution. 
Normal people would get to make it their Resolution to lose weight, get
a better job, or find a significant other. 
But why would Jaden want to do any of that?  At first, listening to the fortune cookie and
nothing but the fortune cookie sounds like a great idea, but then it goes
horribly, horribly wrong.</p>

<h4>A Documentary film inspired by the beauty of making blades.</h4>
<div>6 years ago, I saw a TV show introducing Japanese blacksmiths and saying how accurate their works were. Mr. Funazu (FUNAHIRO) was in it, one of the greatest blacksmiths in Japan. He is specialised in chisels and planes. </div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462329898/funahiro_ozfocl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<p>I love how he creates blades. The process of making blades was amazingly beautiful. So I had made a decision to make a film about him and his mentor, Mr. Usui Kengo. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462332159/usui_1200_yenwby.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Some people might think, WHY THEM? There are other blacksmiths in Japan, who have accurate techniques and there's no doubt of the authenticities. Then what makes them so special? You are right, but I would love to present you the story of them because they are only people making blades with chemical research of metals and steels although it's pretty natural for blacksmiths in Japan to succeed the tradition only by senses, not with research. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>FUNAHIRO started his research when his father told him his skills weren't good enough. His enthusiasm of blades leaded him to Mr. Usui, who was a legendary blacksmith. Mr. Usui was the first blacksmith who research the metals and steels with microscope in Japan. <br/></p>
<p>The friendship between FUNAHIRO and Mr. Usui was more than a friendship.</p>
<p>This film has to be about their friendship and I hope this shows you the beauty of handmade or depth of culture and the love of people and art. </p>

Rough editing of blade making. 

the Blacksmith
Historical architecture and wooden products are made by the hands of carpenters, builders and artists. However, no one can make anything without the tools. This documentary film focuses on blacksmiths who help create and preserve Japanese historical culture.






A Documentary film inspired by the beauty of making blades.
6 years ago, I saw a TV show introducing Japanese blacksmiths and saying how accurate their works were. Mr. Funazu (FUNAHIRO) was in it, one of the greatest blacksmiths in Japan. He is specialised in chisels and planes. 




I love how he creates blades. The process of making blades was amazingly beautiful. So I had made a decision to make a film about him and his mentor, Mr. Usui Kengo. 


Some people might think, WHY THEM? There are other blacksmiths in Japan, who have accurate techniques and there's no doubt of the authenticities. Then what makes them so special? You are right, but I would love to present you the story of them because they are only people making blades with chemical research of metals and steels although it's pretty natural for blacksmiths in Japan to succeed the tradition only by senses, not with research. 

FUNAHIRO started his research when his father told him his skills weren't good enough. His enthusiasm of blades leaded him to Mr. Usui, who was a legendary blacksmith. Mr. Usui was the first blacksmith who research the metals and steels with microscope in Japan. 
The friendship between FUNAHIRO and Mr. Usui was more than a friendship.
This film has to be about their friendship and I hope this shows you the beauty of handmade or depth of culture and the love of people and art.

By day I am a software engineer at a insurance company in the Cleveland Ohio area,  and by night I'm a mother and wife, and a startup entrepreneur for Round House Games, LLC.

<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>P210 Productions is famous for producing high-quality, exciting film productions with relatively small amounts of cash. We produced <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yQd-jGsOJs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Writer's Ghost</a> on a shoestring budget of $15,000, a vat of human sweat, and even a little blood (not even kidding...producer Michael Hitchcock scraped his forearm on a nail).</p>
<p>P210 is in the process of setting up for seasons 2-10.  Your contribution will enable us to produce an even higher quality episodic drama that will entertain and amaze you for seasons to come. More importantly, you can be a major part of film history, leaving your mark on the world for centuries to come. Whenever your friends or family watch ""Pray"" they will be forced to remember how cool you were for being part of the foundation that built this exciting supernatural drama. In fact, they will likely call you up and let you know just how surreal it is to know someone like you.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p>We are no strangers to risk. When ""Pray"" director David L. Bulkley invited  Michael J. Hitchcock to move from Tennessee to Montana to film Michael's screenplay (The Writer's Ghost), they engaged in a high-risk game of making a movie out of nothing. In less than eight months they had completed filming and the following year were in talks with distributors. Yeah...we know risk.</p>
<p>Our most daunting challenge is juggling schedules. Independent filmmakers frequently work with actors and crew who have pesky day-jobs (just like we do). Bob can be on the set on Monday, but Tina can't and Edward might make it if his flu symptoms are gone by then, but only if the Fire Department doesn't get a call that day because we're borrowing their water truck for a scene where Angela gets run over by a Lear jet. What? Oh...the Lear jet isn't available on Monday. Maybe Tuesday?</p>
<p>You get it.</p>
<p>We've solved this challenge in the past through sheer determination and scheduling shoots far in advance, allowing actors and cast to request time-off. We'll do it again.</p>
<p>Our second challenge is purchasing new equipment and repairing old equipment. This requires cash. We put every spare penny of our own money into this effort, but in order to give you the best quality supernatural drama we can, we still need a few more of those Benjamins. This is where you can make a huge difference. A few dollars here and a few bucks there and you've made it possible for us to film the entire first season (and maybe the second)!<i> You SO rock!</i></p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are a team of independent filmmakers who said heck with the Hollywood Studio system!  We don't like waiting on others to decide our future.  We'd rather grab the bull by the horns ourselves.  That being said, we are ready to make a dynamite film, that might be low budget but will NEVER look it!</p>
<p>Obviously we aren't tackling a Sci-Fi epic or a Superhero film... we'd need a little bigger budget for that ;) but we are making a heck of a thriller.  It is mysterious, suspenseful, character driven and above all shocking to the core!  The best part is, you won't be able to sniff that it's low budget.  Don't get us wrong, we have all the respect in the world for those who set out to make a film by any means necessary (we've all been there) but we aren't out to make a great film ""for the budget"" we are going to make a great film PERIOD. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Premise</h3>
<p>A sexy tale of lust, greed, murder and redemption set against the scorching desert of the America Southwest.</p>
</div><p></p><h3>Our Goal</h3><p> Our mission is to create a one of a kind film.   We have secured a  budget for our film that just barely gets us by in production and post-production.  However,  we are looking to raise $5,000 in order to get through pre-production until those funds go live.  We have assembled an incredibly talented cast and crew, many of whom have already begun working tirelessly on prepping the film.</p><h3>What We Need</h3><p></p><p></p><div>This campaign is EVERYTHING!  We are looking for $5,000 to cover preliminary pre-production costs.  Much of our crew have been gracious enough to start working on the many rigorous tasks of pre-production, prepping the film with barely enough for coffee and gas money.  Their work is invaluable!  A successful pre-production truly fosters a successful film.  The more preparation, the better the final product!   </div><div><br/></div><div><h3>What You Get</h3></div><div>
<p>We have put together a number of intriguing perks for you to choose from.  We aren't looking for handouts, we want to reward you for supporting us and helping us achieve our goal!  Check 'em out, you could become a <b>PRODUCER </b>and even attend the<b> LA PREMIERE</b> of the film!!!</p>

We are a team of independent filmmakers who said heck with the Hollywood Studio system!  We don't like waiting on others to decide our future.  We'd rather grab the bull by the horns ourselves.  That being said, we are ready to make a dynamite film, that might be low budget but will NEVER look it!
Obviously we aren't tackling a Sci-Fi epic or a Superhero film... we'd need a little bigger budget for that ;) but we are making a heck of a thriller.  It is mysterious, suspenseful, character driven and above all shocking to the core!  The best part is, you won't be able to sniff that it's low budget.  Don't get us wrong, we have all the respect in the world for those who set out to make a film by any means necessary (we've all been there) but we aren't out to make a great film ""for the budget"" we are going to make a great film PERIOD. 

The Premise
A sexy tale of lust, greed, murder and redemption set against the scorching desert of the America Southwest.
Our Goal Our mission is to create a one of a kind film.   We have secured a  budget for our film that just barely gets us by in production and post-production.  However,  we are looking to raise $5,000 in order to get through pre-production until those funds go live.  We have assembled an incredibly talented cast and crew, many of whom have already begun working tirelessly on prepping the film.What We NeedThis campaign is EVERYTHING!  We are looking for $5,000 to cover preliminary pre-production costs.  Much of our crew have been gracious enough to start working on the many rigorous tasks of pre-production, prepping the film with barely enough for coffee and gas money.  Their work is invaluable!  A successful pre-production truly fosters a successful film.  The more preparation, the better the final product!   What You Get
We have put together a number of intriguing perks for you to choose from.  We aren't looking for handouts, we want to reward you for supporting us and helping us achieve our goal!  Check 'em out, you could become a PRODUCER and even attend the LA PREMIERE of the film!!!

founder of <i>the Estudio Actuemos</i> Academy,
in Merida, Venezuela. At the end of every workshop in our Academy, we aim to
carry out a project in which our students participate with students of the
Audiovisual Media School at the University of Los Andes in order to gain more
experience in the cinematographic world.</p>
<p>We are currently in the middle of the workshop number
11 and our final project will be named “Psychotic”. </p>
<p>The problem we are passing through is that we do not
have the economic means to cover the cost of the project. This particular issue
makes impossible the accomplishment of our project, which is, at the same time,
the EAA students’ final test. Therefore, we would be losing an excellent opportunity
to live an experience that could mean a great growth for us as actors and
filmmakers in training.</p>
<p>For this reason, I would like to ask for your
financial support so we can make the final project of our session 11. Our goal
is to get 4000 $ to help us pay the costs of food, transportation, scenery,
equipment rent, crew and festivals tickets.</p>
<p>Even if I would like to offer more to those who help
us to achieve our goal, I will give with immense gratitude the following: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A short
film copy*.</p>
<p>·<span>

closest friends. It’s a great celebration. Angelica goes to the kitchen to get
a knife for the cake. Her friends decide to go out and forget to help Angelica

no one is there. She goes out to the balcony to call the others but she is
suddenly pulled inward. The door closes and everything is in dark. </p>
<p>Her friends are perplexed. They approach to the
cottage but they realize it is completely empty. They hear Angelica’s scream in
the woods and they do not understand how she could get there all alone.
Angelica’s friends decide to enter into the woods to find her but instead of it
they find unexpected situations that put their lives in danger. </p>

<p>Sus amigos quedan perplejos, se
