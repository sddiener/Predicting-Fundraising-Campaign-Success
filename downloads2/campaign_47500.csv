<div>I'm a retired alternative model, I've been in the industry for approximately 10 years and during this time i have learned to market myself as a brand which i hope puts me in good stead to market my new brand VE Cosmetics.</div>
<div>Ive always struggled to find cosmetics that were all natural and ethical. I also recently fell pregnant so I started making my own cosmetics so I knew exactly what the ingredients were &amp; that the ingredients were safe for me to use.</div>
<div>I've had a lot of interest in my products &amp; would love to launch my own brand.</div>
<div>I've sold off a lot of my possessions to fund a website &amp; buy my url <a href=""http://www.ve-cosmetics.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ve-cosmetics.com,</a> I've also managed to buy some ingredients &amp; plain cosmetic pots. This first range has been sent out to bloggers &amp; makeup artists to try and get the brand name some attention.</div>
<div>I now need to find more ingredients &amp; promotional material/packaging/cosmetics pots/lipstick tubes. I've worked out that £750 should set me up and pay for enough ingredients to launch a first basic range.</div>
<div>Your funding would enable me to create a line of cosmetics that are made from sustainable produce, that is 100% natural, handmade, cruelty free &amp; vegan friendly - basically guilt free cosmetics!</div>

<br/></b><p></p></div>","Hello friends! My name is Amber Welch. Over the past few years I've dedicated my business and my passion to making custom corsets. Being involved in the corset community has allowed me to connect and work with many wonderful people. 
Me, in a Lovely Rat's CorsetI'm constantly working to create the highest quality product I can for my clients. The costs and time involved however, have put my pieces out of reach of many people who love the Lovely Rats aesthetic but can't afford it. This is one reason I host annual giveaways and sample sales. Corsets have the ability to help and heal people, whether through medical support or a confidence boost. When I can I try to make my product available to those who could not otherwise afford it.   Now I have an opportunity to produce an off the rack line with a high quality ethical manufacturer, and make my brand accessible to those who dream of owning a Lovely Rat's corset. 
Model Zessina, Velvet Luxe PhotographyThe Lovely Rat's aesthetic is all about femininity and fun. We're known for bold color combinations, handsewn embellishments, and creative themes. People can recognize a Lovely Rat corset at a glance, and it will be no different for the OTR line. My goal with the OTR line is to replicate the construction, look, and materials of my custom work as much as possible. Each corset will feature Thai silk fashion fabric in a delicate pastel color pallette, a floral cotton lining, and external channels. Factory prototype of the new OTR line. The pattern will feature the gently curved back popular in my custom work, replicating a more natural posture while still offering comfortable support. My new line will have a 'build your own' feature and offer semicustom embellishment options unlike anything else in the market. The interactive corset designer will allow customers to choose from three base colors, three bow placement options in three colors, and three lace placement options in three colors. From there you can select additional covered garters, rhinestones, or flossing.  These elements will give you the ability to make your corset totally unique. I'll also be adding the embellishments myself, giving them that handcrafted touch of custom work. Selling ready to wear corsets will also support the custom side of my business and allow me to put more attention and time into individual orders, pursue new exciting projects, as well as allow me to become a vendor at events and conventions. The Lovely Rat's studio. My goal is to begin production in early 2017 and hopefully launch the line for sale that summer. If the campaign exceeds its goal I will be able to offer more color options and maybe even be able to personally oversee production.The patterns and details are still in product development, but I expect a 12""-14"" hipspring, and intend to keep the corsets in the $150-$250 range. Here's a preview of the sillhouette in action:https://www.instagram.com/p/BEwUA-mOPsn/?taken-by=lovelyratscorsetry  Thanks so much for your ongoing support, it means everything to me!THE PERKS!$5 USD: A personal thank you note from me for your contribution.

Can you imagine what a struggle it is for me to get dressed? Have you seen that wheelchair users wear sweatpants all the time? Or have you ever googled the weird looking trousers that are called ‘special pants for wheelchair users’?</p><p>Well, I’m about to change all that!<i><strong> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480426802/y0bi3sdu8vpvnco8kyqa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></i></p><p><strong>The perfect pair of pants</strong></p><p>Normal trousers cause all kinds of problems for people in a wheelchair. The pair of trousers start sagging while the trouser legs start pulling up, so both your back and your ankles become visible. The crotch area starts to tighten and the seams start to hurt from sitting on them. These are just a few of the problems you face when you are wearing normal trousers when living in a wheelchair and I want to eliminate all of them!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480336700/qwszrdyhgirhnka9ehlz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480336713/whduvg7gnhz4q4pusdhv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>A unique design to solve problems</strong></p><p>I’m young, and I deserve to look good - even in my wheelchair! So I developed a unique pair of trousers that look awesome. But that wasn’t enough for me. I wanted to address all problems, not only appearance and comfort. So I looked for ways to solve more challenging issues like health problems and lack of independence. I made sure the trousers were designed to decrease the chance of getting pressure sores and other kinds of skin damage and Increased the independence of the wearer. In short, my pair of trousers focuses on comfort far beyond anything else you can find on the market today!</p><p><strong>Unique features</strong></p><p>My trousers have a <strong>higher back</strong> and <strong>extended trouser legs</strong>.</p><ul><li>Classic, increases comfort and improves your look.</li></ul><p>The only pair of trousers in the world <strong>without seams on the sitting surface </strong>and <strong>repositioned seams</strong>.</p><ul>

<strong>Fabric</strong>: I found the perfect fabric for my pants! It’s unique, stretchy cloth from Japan that has two layers of cotton with spandex in between.

Unfortunately, I can only buy 1,000 meters of fabric (costing $10/meter) for a first production run. I can’t do that on my own!

Can you imagine what a struggle it is for me to get dressed? Have you seen that wheelchair users wear sweatpants all the time? Or have you ever googled the weird looking trousers that are called ‘special pants for wheelchair users’?Well, I’m about to change all that! The perfect pair of pantsNormal trousers cause all kinds of problems for people in a wheelchair. The pair of trousers start sagging while the trouser legs start pulling up, so both your back and your ankles become visible. The crotch area starts to tighten and the seams start to hurt from sitting on them. These are just a few of the problems you face when you are wearing normal trousers when living in a wheelchair and I want to eliminate all of them!A unique design to solve problemsI’m young, and I deserve to look good - even in my wheelchair! So I developed a unique pair of trousers that look awesome. But that wasn’t enough for me. I wanted to address all problems, not only appearance and comfort. So I looked for ways to solve more challenging issues like health problems and lack of independence. I made sure the trousers were designed to decrease the chance of getting pressure sores and other kinds of skin damage and Increased the independence of the wearer. In short, my pair of trousers focuses on comfort far beyond anything else you can find on the market today!Unique featuresMy trousers have a higher back and extended trouser legs.Classic, increases comfort and improves your look.The only pair of trousers in the world without seams on the sitting surface and repositioned seams.
To prevent pressure differences.
To decrease the chance of pressure sores.
To Increase comfort.

The only pair of trousers with pullers and an easy magnetic button.
Increases independence of people with diminished fine motor skills.
Decreases workload of caregivers.
Designed to be Invisible when seated.

We use a unique combination of a lower front waist with geometric elastic sides.
Prevents the trousers of slipping down.
Provides a more comfortable fit.
Allows weight fluctuations without loss of comfort.

An idea worth sharingDo you know how many people there are in the world who need to use a wheelchair like me? Literally millions! So why would I keep my exclusive design all to myself when I could be helping others who are facing the same daily struggle? A struggle to get dressed, a struggle to stay healthy, and a struggle to feel good enough about ourselves to go out in to the world? No reason! So here’s my campaign, and here’s where you come in!What We Need & What You GetAs you can see in the video above and the pictures below, my trouser design has already gone through lots of changes and is now almost fully developed.But there are two things I need your help with: input and fabric.
Input: I need to know what you think! If you are in a wheelchair (or are a caretaker with experience), let me know what you would like to add to my design to make it even more perfect. But that’s not all! If you have any other tips for me to make my trousers a success on the market and stay ahead of the competition, let me know! I want to form a community of people who care, because it’s by listening to friends’ friends that I found the perfect fabric for my pants. And that takes me to number two…
Fabric: I found the perfect fabric for my pants! It’s unique, stretchy cloth from Japan that has two layers of cotton with spandex in between. This means that it is stretchy, but the spandex has no direct contact with your skin. The cloth also breathes so the temperature and the moisture build-up is low. Unfortunately, I can only buy 1,000 meters of fabric (costing $10/meter) for a first production run. I can’t do that on my own! So I need your help. How YOU can help
The first thing you can do, is join my community.

The second thing you can do, is get the word about my amazing pants out there with the hashtags #MetersforMakt #Makt #Sitwear & #Maktdatjegoedzit . 
The third thing you can do, is fund me to get that amazing fabric for my trousers.

Ordinary sun hats help but they absorb the sun's radiant heat. 
There is a better solution.Alchemi Sun Hats utilize PATENT PENDING Radiant Barrier Technology to REFLECT UP TO 80% OF THE SUN'S HEAT WAVES away from your body instead of absorbing it like conventional hats. The radiant barrier also BLOCKS 99.8% OF SKIN DAMAGING UV RAYS WITH A TESTED UPF OF WELL OVER 800! Using state-of-the-art production techniques we laminate our radiant barrier material to a soft, thin polyester fabric that provides comfort as well as function.


Radiant barriers have been in use for years most notably in the space industry. Space suits as well as space craft have utilized radiant barriers to protect astronauts from extreme temperatures in space.In order to maximize heat reflective performance, radiant barrier material must be directly exposed to the sun's heat waves.

<p>Hello my name is Gabriella Gordillo I am an American Fashion Designer from San Francisco, California. Ever since I was a young girl I always had the mind 
of a successful business woman.  From the time I was a little girl I was taught how to behave as a professional in all aspects of my life.
 Attending a private  grade school and a public high school, I kept my focus on academics and my future career goals. Graduating high 
school a year earlier than my peers, I continued on with my career 
aspirations.</p>
<p>Originally following a passion as a health and personal fitness trainer a whirlwind of events, in 2013, inspired me to design my first line of street wear fashion in Los Angeles. I rounded up a 
street team to promote my brand and soon enjoyed success through my street wear designs.</p>
<p>In 2015, I moved back to San Francisco where I launched my men's and women's luxury collection, Proper Attire US. The collection is a stylish luxury
 line fit for the busy lifestyle of the modern-day professional. 
Influenced by designers such as Ralph Lauren, Balenciaga, and Balmain 
designer, Olivier Rousteing, I feature ready to wear looks that
 are both youthful and contemporary. The line features a diverse and 
classic/futuristic style.  My sleek, minimalist lines, bold colors, and
 high quality fabrics ensure that each design flatters and moves with 
the lines and curves of the individual.</p>
<p>I continue to enhance my line to include 
styles that easily transition between sophisticated evening wear to 
modern and edgy streetwear. My collection continues to grow through the
 global inspiration of American, European, and Japanese fashions. The 
only limitation I have are the funds to expand my line and put it into store front across America.</p>
<p>In order for me to create just the samples for the collection, have a proper photo shoot, finish the website and create my catalogs I had to sell everything I own excluding my car because that is how I get to my other job that helps me pay down my credit card statement that I had maxed out as well as depleted my whole savings so now Im literally at the point of just hoping with all this hard work I put in that my clothing will be put into store fronts. I wish it was that easy... </p>
<p>You see, even though I have accomplished so many things so far despite the adversities I have faced I am still facing some. I am a new emerging luxury fashion designer which I have never been before, my name is not known in the fashion community and even though I create beautiful designs and use the finest fabric and metal hardware for my garments this is not enough as of right now to make my mark in the fashion industry. I didn't expect that to happen right away anyway, but it is proving more and more true as I am now finished with the development stage of my line and now I must try to get my clothing into store fronts. The only way to pretty much do this that I have found through actually trying is for me to be able to offer my clothing to stores on consignment so that way they don't have to pay for the garments and production upfront which typically I would not want to do but if it is the only way to get my clothing in stores then I must not give up.</p>
<p> I do not have the funds currently to make this happen and I am almost worried because if this line doesn't have a chance to even be in one store now then I will have made not made any money from this line to be able to even fund another collection to keep my company going. All I need is one shot I would never give up hope on myself I went from just an idea to actually giving up everything I have and sacrificing my possessions as well as the apartment I used to live in just to solely make sure that I am giving this my 100 percent full dedication. I would never ask someone to help me if I havn't already given it my complete all. Words couldn't even express the magnitude to what I would feel if someone out there even just one person could understand my situation and be willing to help me. I would be forever thankful to you for this. </p> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In greater detail what I would be doing with the funds are producing my designs in higher volume so I can cut costs in the process and be able to offer my garments at a little cheaper of a price as well as offer the buyers consignment because that is the only way the stores with my target price point are excepting new designers. I am in a highly competitive business but just the fact that against all odds I was even able to do any of  this and do it so well that I get nothing but positive feed back from people in the fashion industry gives me hope. </p>
<p>Most of you may be asking why $10,000. I can explain that I have narrowed down my buyers list to 10 top boutiques that I would want to have my clothing in. I am working in a high end market and my clothing wholesales for anywhere from $90.00 dollars all the way up to 540.00 so you can imagine that asking stores who don't even know who I am to buy my garments for 540.00 each would be kind of rough. Which it is. The upside is me being able to manufacture that 540.00 garment on my own at the cost price and offer the garments on consignment to be able to get my clothing into store easier. This will also give me publicity and build my brands name. It will also be easier on myself once I make my next collection since I will have already built a report with certain stores if my clothes have already been carried there, it will be easier for me to get my clothing in them the second time around on my own. And hopefully not on consignment because if I was given this chance to be able to be in these stores right now I know I have the skill and know how to be able to only go up from there. Also with the money I would invest in some p.r to make sure if I did have my clothing available in these store fronts on consignment that the world would know about it. It would make your donations all the more secure, because they would be going to benefit the brand no matter what. My clothing would be able to get a lot of good press being at the best of the best boutiques. If all else fails I have a second and third plan if there is any remaining money after this I will use it to try to make a smaller spring summer collection to show my consistency in this fashion business. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>My dreams are so big that people might think I'm crazy, but my goal is to be the next globally known household name in fashion from America. A lot of well known designers are from Europe and such and it is my dream and calling to able to be right up there next to them with endless possibilities for my brand Proper Attire US. I have thought about this very hard for the past few years of my life I had a very successful street wear brand in Los Angeles which helped me fund the whole entire luxury line that I have just recently created called Proper Attire US. I am a new designer in a standpoint of being in a high end market now, but I am not new in the sense of business and being in fashion so you would be able to rest assure that your donations would be going to thought out planned actions that would do nothing but give my company a chance to meet its potential. I want this brand to be an iconic name in representing American fashion and American Culture. </p>
<p>One day I even want to start causes and my own campaigns for young children and even adults that have visions and dreams that are hard for them to reach. I want to be able to be in a position one day to help them and guide them and give them an outlet to learn. To be able to succeed in life because it is hard when you are on your own. I don't want anyone to feel alone like I have these past few years. Following my dreams really has been a blessing, because I have learned so much about myself and about my purpose in life, but it has also brought me to my lowest points in order to learn these things. A lot of times people give up during these processes and I never did or will. Most people wouldn't give up everything they have or even all there money they wouldn't want to loose there security. For me, this is so much bigger than a saving account or materials its about changing the world through my fashion. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I face obstacles daily a lot of times they happen multiple times a day, but I have found it is all about the mind set you have and being able to problem solve. A lot of these obstacles are not really obstacles unless I label them that. I have a short story that just recently happened to me to explain this. </p>
<p>I had just got all my samples made from my sample factory and when I received them there were two that had flaws on them but my photo shoot was the next day so there was nothing I could do about it. I had to make sure that I created the illusion in the photographs that everything was perfect on them. Everything turned out good during the shoot so after I had time to send the garments back to the factory to fix them. They finished the garments and they looked great so the factory sent them back to me but the package got lost in the mail. So initially people might think I would of freaked out or panicked or even got mad at the factory or shipping service, but I didn't. This is not how I live my life I believe in trusting in my journey and seeing the good, seeing the lessons life is presenting to me and learning from them. What I did was stay calm and continue working I would never want to waist valuable time I could be spending working on my brand, worrying, because that is what gets in the way of success. I called the shipping company however for a few days and no one knew where the package was. The garments in the packages cost me a few grand each so I wouldn't of had the money to even be able to remake them.  I actually just  came back from the shipping location earlier today, they found my package. </p>
<p>Events like this and how I am able to handle them so well I am convinced I can handle anything life presents to me because of my mindset. I put out into the world positivity and the world gives it back to me. This is something no one can take away from me I could never give this up. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Honestly, anything will help me at this point even If I don't get the funds to go into stores this year I at least would hope people donated to me so I can be able to afford proper p.r so my online sales can do well and help me produce my next collection properly. Through all I have been through I have trained my mind to see the good in all things, I hope whoever is reading this has saw the good in me. </p>
</div></div>","Short Summary 
Hello my name is Gabriella Gordillo I am an American Fashion Designer from San Francisco, California. Ever since I was a young girl I always had the mind 
of a successful business woman.  From the time I was a little girl I was taught how to behave as a professional in all aspects of my life.
 Attending a private  grade school and a public high school, I kept my focus on academics and my future career goals. Graduating high 
school a year earlier than my peers, I continued on with my career 
aspirations.
Originally following a passion as a health and personal fitness trainer a whirlwind of events, in 2013, inspired me to design my first line of street wear fashion in Los Angeles. I rounded up a 
street team to promote my brand and soon enjoyed success through my street wear designs.
In 2015, I moved back to San Francisco where I launched my men's and women's luxury collection, Proper Attire US. The collection is a stylish luxury
 line fit for the busy lifestyle of the modern-day professional. 
Influenced by designers such as Ralph Lauren, Balenciaga, and Balmain 
designer, Olivier Rousteing, I feature ready to wear looks that
 are both youthful and contemporary. The line features a diverse and 
classic/futuristic style.  My sleek, minimalist lines, bold colors, and
 high quality fabrics ensure that each design flatters and moves with 
the lines and curves of the individual.
I continue to enhance my line to include 
styles that easily transition between sophisticated evening wear to 
modern and edgy streetwear. My collection continues to grow through the
 global inspiration of American, European, and Japanese fashions. The 
only limitation I have are the funds to expand my line and put it into store front across America.
In order for me to create just the samples for the collection, have a proper photo shoot, finish the website and create my catalogs I had to sell everything I own excluding my car because that is how I get to my other job that helps me pay down my credit card statement that I had maxed out as well as depleted my whole savings so now Im literally at the point of just hoping with all this hard work I put in that my clothing will be put into store fronts. I wish it was that easy... 
You see, even though I have accomplished so many things so far despite the adversities I have faced I am still facing some. I am a new emerging luxury fashion designer which I have never been before, my name is not known in the fashion community and even though I create beautiful designs and use the finest fabric and metal hardware for my garments this is not enough as of right now to make my mark in the fashion industry. I didn't expect that to happen right away anyway, but it is proving more and more true as I am now finished with the development stage of my line and now I must try to get my clothing into store fronts. The only way to pretty much do this that I have found through actually trying is for me to be able to offer my clothing to stores on consignment so that way they don't have to pay for the garments and production upfront which typically I would not want to do but if it is the only way to get my clothing in stores then I must not give up.
 I do not have the funds currently to make this happen and I am almost worried because if this line doesn't have a chance to even be in one store now then I will have made not made any money from this line to be able to even fund another collection to keep my company going. All I need is one shot I would never give up hope on myself I went from just an idea to actually giving up everything I have and sacrificing my possessions as well as the apartment I used to live in just to solely make sure that I am giving this my 100 percent full dedication. I would never ask someone to help me if I havn't already given it my complete all. Words couldn't even express the magnitude to what I would feel if someone out there even just one person could understand my situation and be willing to help me. I would be forever thankful to you for this.     What We Need & What You Get In greater detail what I would be doing with the funds are producing my designs in higher volume so I can cut costs in the process and be able to offer my garments at a little cheaper of a price as well as offer the buyers consignment because that is the only way the stores with my target price point are excepting new designers. I am in a highly competitive business but just the fact that against all odds I was even able to do any of  this and do it so well that I get nothing but positive feed back from people in the fashion industry gives me hope. 
Most of you may be asking why $10,000. I can explain that I have narrowed down my buyers list to 10 top boutiques that I would want to have my clothing in. I am working in a high end market and my clothing wholesales for anywhere from $90.00 dollars all the way up to 540.00 so you can imagine that asking stores who don't even know who I am to buy my garments for 540.00 each would be kind of rough. Which it is. The upside is me being able to manufacture that 540.00 garment on my own at the cost price and offer the garments on consignment to be able to get my clothing into store easier. This will also give me publicity and build my brands name. It will also be easier on myself once I make my next collection since I will have already built a report with certain stores if my clothes have already been carried there, it will be easier for me to get my clothing in them the second time around on my own. And hopefully not on consignment because if I was given this chance to be able to be in these stores right now I know I have the skill and know how to be able to only go up from there. Also with the money I would invest in some p.r to make sure if I did have my clothing available in these store fronts on consignment that the world would know about it. It would make your donations all the more secure, because they would be going to benefit the brand no matter what. My clothing would be able to get a lot of good press being at the best of the best boutiques. If all else fails I have a second and third plan if there is any remaining money after this I will use it to try to make a smaller spring summer collection to show my consistency in this fashion business.    The Impact My dreams are so big that people might think I'm crazy, but my goal is to be the next globally known household name in fashion from America. A lot of well known designers are from Europe and such and it is my dream and calling to able to be right up there next to them with endless possibilities for my brand Proper Attire US. I have thought about this very hard for the past few years of my life I had a very successful street wear brand in Los Angeles which helped me fund the whole entire luxury line that I have just recently created called Proper Attire US. I am a new designer in a standpoint of being in a high end market now, but I am not new in the sense of business and being in fashion so you would be able to rest assure that your donations would be going to thought out planned actions that would do nothing but give my company a chance to meet its potential. I want this brand to be an iconic name in representing American fashion and American Culture. 
One day I even want to start causes and my own campaigns for young children and even adults that have visions and dreams that are hard for them to reach. I want to be able to be in a position one day to help them and guide them and give them an outlet to learn. To be able to succeed in life because it is hard when you are on your own. I don't want anyone to feel alone like I have these past few years. Following my dreams really has been a blessing, because I have learned so much about myself and about my purpose in life, but it has also brought me to my lowest points in order to learn these things.

For me, this is so much bigger than a saving account or materials its about changing the world through my fashion.    Risks & Challenges I face obstacles daily a lot of times they happen multiple times a day, but I have found it is all about the mind set you have and being able to problem solve. A lot of these obstacles are not really obstacles unless I label them that. I have a short story that just recently happened to me to explain this. 
I had just got all my samples made from my sample factory and when I received them there were two that had flaws on them but my photo shoot was the next day so there was nothing I could do about it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Both Aaron and Alexis have a passion for sunglasses and we wanted to create a high quality pair of sunglasses without the HUGE brand inflation. We did a lot of research into the sunglass market and noticed that a lot of the brands are either high quality and very expensive or low quality and still have a mid ranged price. What we wanted to do was create a brand that offered the high quality features of your Rayban or Oakley sunglasses but at a price that is affordable. We did a lot of research into different types of plastics and metals until we found something that was suitable. Our features include acetate frames. spring hinges, and polarized/uv400 lenses (More information on these features below). We then wanted to create a business that gave back. We believe that not enough businesses are doing this and we both love giving back to the community. We decided to give back 10% of our profits to 4 different charities that we support (Red Cross, Heart and Stroke Foundation, March of Dimes and Seva). The cool part about this is that you get to choose from which of the 4 charities you would like to see the donation go to. We hope that you come along for the ride and help us establish our brand in the sunglass industry. </div>

<b>What does ""make them yours"" mean?</b><p>Throughout all of our research we noticed that almost all modern sunglasses companies design their marketing campaigns and imaging around the beach, swimming or surfing. We however are from Northern Ontario where a lot of the year is winter and in the summer beaches are few and far between. <b>""Make them yours"" </b>simply means that we realize not everyone is always going to be on that beach catching the rays wearing your Cauz Sunglasses.

<p><b>Wayfarers</b></p>
<p>When designing our wayfarer style sunglasses we were looking for a few different things. First we wanted to find a plastic that was <b>durable</b> and had some weight to it. To us there is nothing worse that ordering a pair of glasses online and when they come in they feel very cheap. That is not the case with Cauz. Our frames are made out of acetate which is a <b>durable, high quality plastic.</b> The next feature we were looking for were spring hinges. Spring hinge temples ensure that the glasses remain intact and do not become loose and out of shape. Also they are a <b>very comfortable </b>fit to the head.

<p>Hi! Let me introduce
myself: <b>Jon Camo</b>, <i>Montreal </i> independent designer. <br/></p>
<p>I’m 26 years old and father of
a 3 years old son, but first and foremost the owner and creator of Chaud Lapin:
Streetwear &amp; Lifestyle brand.</p>
<p> 4 months ago I took the decision to quit my
day job; I was a footwear designer for an international brand. On my free time,
I’d be selling what I’d made for Chaud Lapin in music shows, events, car meetings
from my car trunk, as the brand was not offered yet in stores or shops. </p>
<p>You
see, Chaud Lapin is not only the result of my Life, but also the result of my
struggles and managing to do whatever I can with what I have, in order to
realize my dream. </p>
<p>Soon, I will get to design for the first time a whole collection
without involving money in the process. What I want to achieve is to expand the
Chaud Lapin line (Hats, Boxers (Men &amp; Women) &amp; and in the future produce Shoes, Condoms, Jeans and MORE).</p>
<p>Without tons
of amazing people surrounding me and supporting my dream, I wouldn’t be where I
am today and Chaud Lapin wouldn’t exist. </p>
<p>I consider myself extremely lucky to
receive as much love from my family as well as friends and even perfect
strangers, on my road to success. </p>
<p>So today, I’m asking you to help me build a
Lifestyle Company, a brand with values, a success story.</p>

<p><i>Salut ! Laissez-moi me présenter : Jon Camo, designer indépendant de Montréal.  </i></p>
<p><i>26 ans et papa d’un petit gars de 3 ans, mais d’abord et avant tout le mastermind et créateur derrière Chaud Lapin : Streetwear &amp; Lifestyle. </i></p>
<p><i>Il y a quelques mois, j’ai pris la décision de quitter mon emploi; je dessinais des chaussures pour une compagnie internationale. Le soir, je vendais des produits Chaud Lapin directement de mon coffre de voiture dans des shows de musique, événements, rassemblement de chars, etc. </i></p>
<p><i>Voyez-vous, Chaud Lapin n’est pas seulement mon projet de Vie, mais aussi le résultat de dur labeur et de difficultés surmontées. J’ai toujours trouvé le moyen de faire mieux avec peu dans le but de réaliser mon rêve. </i></p>
<p><i>Dans très peu de temps, je serai en mesure de créer une nouve le collection sans impliquer un seul sou dans la production. Mon objectif : Agrandir la gamme Chaud Lapin en incluant des casquettes , sous-vêtements (Hommes &amp; Femmes et ainsi produire des Condoms, Souliers, Jeans &amp; PLUS!</i></p>
<p><i>Sans toutes les merveilleuses personnes qui composent mon entourage, Chaud Lapin n’existerait pas et la personne que je suis non plus. </i></p>
<p><i>Je me considère extrêmement choyé d’être entouré d’autant de beau monde et de recevoir leur support au quotidien. Que ce soit des amis, la famille ou de parfaits inconnus, je sens une grosse vague d’amour me mener vers la réussite. </i></p>
<p><i>Aujourd’hui, je vous demande un coup de main pour m’aider à construire une compagnie de Lifestyle, une marque qui a des valeurs, un success story. </i></p>

<p><b>Crowdfunding campaign</b></p>
</div><div>
<p>The money from the
donations will go directly into the line production, shipping fees and custom
fees. </p>
<p>Since I'm my own designer, there will be no design fees! Also, know that Chaud
Lapin releases its gear in limited editions, which means that there’s this
sense of unicity bonded to the product and the brand.  </p>
<p>If the funding doesn't reach the goal, I will
still be delivering every item that has been selected by the crowdfunding
donors, and will unfortunately have to let aside the other designs. </p>
<p>With the
crowdfunding campaign, I want to create a worldwide hype for Chaud Lapin, I
want to live the dream I’ve had since I was just a kid: to be able to have a
shop and call it my own. With YOUR help, everything is possible, even the
wildest dreams.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Tout l’argent amassé ira directement dans le processus de production de la nouvelle ligne Chaud Lapin, dans les frais de poste et de douane. </i></p>
<p><i>Comme je design tout moi-même, il n’y aura pas de frais! Sachez que Chaud Lapin offre une toujours des collections en édition limitée, ce qui assure la rareté du produit et de la marque. </i></p>
<p><i>Si jamais nous n’arrivons pas à atteindre l’objectif prévu, je m’engage tout de même à livrer chaque item sélectionné par les donateurs mais devrai malheureusement me résigner à laisser de côté les autres designs. </i></p>
<p><i>Avec cette campagne de fond, je souhaite créer un hype mondial autour de Chaud Lapin, je veux vivre mon rêve de jeunesse : ouvrir et gérer ma propre boutique. Avec VOTRE aide, tout est possible, même les rêves les plus fous.  </i></p>

<p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p>Every dollar raised equals
a step towards the realization of this new collection and the beginning of an
international recognition for Chaud Lapin. I started this project as my pursuit
of happiness (in my own words: pursuit of hotness).</p>
<p>Lately, my mind has been boiling
with so many ideas; I have this craving, this need to create. My head has
become a real gold mine in terms of creativity. For Chaud Lapin and me, it is
time to <b><i>SHINE</i></b>. </p>
<p>I’ve got orders coming from all around the World even though
I’ve never done any marketing for it, or even set foot there <i><b>(France, Greece,
Belgium, UK, France, USA and all the way to the other side of Canada)</b></i>. </p>
<p>Chaud
Lapin has been, along with upbringing my son, my most gratifying life project.
I have such motivation to live from the earnings of what I create. </p>
<p>Brainstorming, designing and creating stuff around funny ideas that will make
each and every one of my clients happy has become a life goal. Chaud lapin is
more than a sex-oriented design brand; it’s a positive revolution about
creating good vibes and a sense of community. It’s a lifestyle that supports
and encourages real VALUES (friendship, loyalty, respect, freedom and open-mindedness). </p>
<p>I’ve had people coming up to me saying: ""Hey Jon, since I know and wear
Chaud Lapin, people stop me in the street to know where I got your gear.’’ This
kind of recognition is exactly what fuels my self-esteem and pushes me into not
giving up what I’ve put so much energy into. </p>
<p>I can now say I have almost everything
in my possession to accomplish my next collection. I’ve created a strong bond

<p>Bringing Smiles with my Naughty Mind</p>
<p><b>Chaud Lapin©</b> | Differently Together</p>
<p><i>by Jon Camo</i></p>
</div></div>","Hi! Let me introduce
myself: Jon Camo, Montreal  independent designer. 
I’m 26 years old and father of
a 3 years old son, but first and foremost the owner and creator of Chaud Lapin:
Streetwear & Lifestyle brand.
 4 months ago I took the decision to quit my
day job; I was a footwear designer for an international brand. On my free time,
I’d be selling what I’d made for Chaud Lapin in music shows, events, car meetings
from my car trunk, as the brand was not offered yet in stores or shops. 
You
see, Chaud Lapin is not only the result of my Life, but also the result of my
struggles and managing to do whatever I can with what I have, in order to
realize my dream. 
Soon, I will get to design for the first time a whole collection
without involving money in the process. What I want to achieve is to expand the
Chaud Lapin line (Hats, Boxers (Men & Women) & and in the future produce Shoes, Condoms, Jeans and MORE).
Without tons
of amazing people surrounding me and supporting my dream, I wouldn’t be where I
am today and Chaud Lapin wouldn’t exist. 
I consider myself extremely lucky to
receive as much love from my family as well as friends and even perfect
strangers, on my road to success. 
So today, I’m asking you to help me build a
Lifestyle Company, a brand with values, a success story.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Salut ! Laissez-moi me présenter : Jon Camo, designer indépendant de Montréal.  
26 ans et papa d’un petit gars de 3 ans, mais d’abord et avant tout le mastermind et créateur derrière Chaud Lapin : Streetwear & Lifestyle. 
Il y a quelques mois, j’ai pris la décision de quitter mon emploi; je dessinais des chaussures pour une compagnie internationale. Le soir, je vendais des produits Chaud Lapin directement de mon coffre de voiture dans des shows de musique, événements, rassemblement de chars, etc. 
Voyez-vous, Chaud Lapin n’est pas seulement mon projet de Vie, mais aussi le résultat de dur labeur et de difficultés surmontées. J’ai toujours trouvé le moyen de faire mieux avec peu dans le but de réaliser mon rêve. 
Dans très peu de temps, je serai en mesure de créer une nouve le collection sans impliquer un seul sou dans la production. Mon objectif : Agrandir la gamme Chaud Lapin en incluant des casquettes , sous-vêtements (Hommes & Femmes et ainsi produire des Condoms, Souliers, Jeans & PLUS!
Sans toutes les merveilleuses personnes qui composent mon entourage, Chaud Lapin n’existerait pas et la personne que je suis non plus. 
Je me considère extrêmement choyé d’être entouré d’autant de beau monde et de recevoir leur support au quotidien. Que ce soit des amis, la famille ou de parfaits inconnus, je sens une grosse vague d’amour me mener vers la réussite. 
Aujourd’hui, je vous demande un coup de main pour m’aider à construire une compagnie de Lifestyle, une marque qui a des valeurs, un success story. 


Crowdfunding campaign

The money from the
donations will go directly into the line production, shipping fees and custom
fees. 
Since I'm my own designer, there will be no design fees! Also, know that Chaud
Lapin releases its gear in limited editions, which means that there’s this
sense of unicity bonded to the product and the brand.  
If the funding doesn't reach the goal, I will
still be delivering every item that has been selected by the crowdfunding
donors, and will unfortunately have to let aside the other designs. 
With the
crowdfunding campaign, I want to create a worldwide hype for Chaud Lapin, I
want to live the dream I’ve had since I was just a kid: to be able to have a
shop and call it my own. With YOUR help, everything is possible, even the
wildest dreams.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tout l’argent amassé ira directement dans le processus de production de la nouvelle ligne Chaud Lapin, dans les frais de poste et de douane. 
Comme je design tout moi-même, il n’y aura pas de frais! Sachez que Chaud Lapin offre une toujours des collections en édition limitée, ce qui assure la rareté du produit et de la marque. 
Si jamais nous n’arrivons pas à atteindre l’objectif prévu, je m’engage tout de même à livrer chaque item sélectionné par les donateurs mais devrai malheureusement me résigner à laisser de côté les autres designs. 
Avec cette campagne de fond, je souhaite créer un hype mondial autour de Chaud Lapin, je veux vivre mon rêve de jeunesse : ouvrir et gérer ma propre boutique. Avec VOTRE aide, tout est possible, même les rêves les plus fous.  




Impact
Every dollar raised equals
a step towards the realization of this new collection and the beginning of an
international recognition for Chaud Lapin. I started this project as my pursuit
of happiness (in my own words: pursuit of hotness).
Lately, my mind has been boiling
with so many ideas; I have this craving, this need to create. My head has
become a real gold mine in terms of creativity. For Chaud Lapin and me, it is
time to SHINE. 
I’ve got orders coming from all around the World even though
I’ve never done any marketing for it, or even set foot there (France, Greece,
Belgium, UK, France, USA and all the way to the other side of Canada). 
Chaud
Lapin has been, along with upbringing my son, my most gratifying life project.
I have such motivation to live from the earnings of what I create. 
Brainstorming, designing and creating stuff around funny ideas that will make
each and every one of my clients happy has become a life goal. Chaud lapin is
more than a sex-oriented design brand; it’s a positive revolution about
creating good vibes and a sense of community. It’s a lifestyle that supports
and encourages real VALUES (friendship, loyalty, respect, freedom and open-mindedness). 
I’ve had people coming up to me saying: ""Hey Jon, since I know and wear
Chaud Lapin, people stop me in the street to know where I got your gear.’’ This
kind of recognition is exactly what fuels my self-esteem and pushes me into not
giving up what I’ve put so much energy into. 
I can now say I have almost everything
in my possession to accomplish my next collection. I’ve created a strong bond
with my Chinese suppliers and have decided to produce everything in Canada, to
ensure good cost and quality.  I create a
long term relationship with my Chinese suppliers, Why not produce in Canada,
for a matter of cost and quality. 
I hope you can now
have a sense of the good vibes I want to bring and stimulate with this naughty
project. Everything's possible. 
Every kind of help is accepted. At Chaud Lapin,
we share the love and the good vibes, don’t be afraid to be part of the
revolution, it’s the best reward an artist could hope for. It’s my vision, my
dream, my purpose in life!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chaque contribution est un pas vers la réalisation de cette nouvelle collection et de la facette internationale de Chaud Lapin. La poursuite de mon bonheur est la base de ce projet (dans mes propres mots : pursuit of Hotness). 
Ces derniers temps, mon cerveau est en pleine ébullition! J’ai ce désir, ce besoin de créer. Ma tête est devenue une vraie mine d’or en terme de créativité. Pour moi et pour Chaud Lapin, c’est le temps de devenir sérieux !  
J’ai des commandes qui proviennent de partout dans le monde, sans publicité, ni jamais avoir mis les pieds là-bas de ma vie ! (France, Grèce, États-Unis, Belgique, UK, et le Canada d’est en ouest). 
Élever mes deux enfants (mon fils et chaud lapin) sont à ce jour mes projets les plus gratifiants. J’ai tellement de motivation, je souhaite véritablement arriver à vivre exclusivement avec Chaud Lapin. 
A chaque jour je brainstorm,  design, créée des prototypes de produits humoristiques et brillants dans le but de rendre chacun de mes clients heureux de son achat.  

Chaud Lapin c’est plus qu’une marque à saveur de sexe. C’est une révolution positive qui encourage des VALEURS comme l’amitié, la loyauté, le respect, la liberté et l’ouverture d’esprit.
 Je me fais souvent dire ‘’ Hey Jo, depuis que je porte ta marque, les gens m’arrêtent dans la rue pour me demander où ils peuvent se procurer tes produits ‘’. Ce genre de reconnaissance est exactement ce qui me pousse à continuer et à me surpasser, à ne pas abandonner ce dans quoi j’ai mis autant d’énergie. 
Je peux maintenant dire que j’ai presque tout ce dont j’ai besoin pour commencer à créer ma nouvelle collection. Le lien tissé avec mes fournisseurs chinois est béton et j’ai décidé de tout produire au Canada par souci de qualité et pour assurer un coût raisonnable.   
J’espère que vous êtes maintenant sensibles à toutes les bonnes ondes que je souhaite amener avec ce projet coquin! 
Tout est possible! Toutes les formes d’aides sont acceptées et bienvenues ! 
Chez Chaud Lapin, nous partageons le love et les attitudes positives. Je vous encourage à faire partie de la révolution; c’est le meilleur coup de pouce que je peux recevoir en tant qu’artiste. 
C’est ma vision, mon rêve, mon projet de vie !

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We need your support launching this sustainable business.  We will be making and selling modular critter mazes for the retail environment.  Currently there are no <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">rat-sized</span> mazes for sale in stores or on the web <em>(hamster tubes and mice mazes are both too small</em>) so we see a great opportunity!</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Your support for the relatively low start-up costs of the tooling and production of the parts, totaling approx. $25,000.  The metal mold tooling is a one-time cost just under $15,000, and the remainder of the funds will go towards the plastic, production costs, packaging, and marketing. Sales will be based mainly on the internet at <a href=""http://www.crittermazes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>crittermazes.com, </strong></a>eBay, Amazon, other online sites a well as trade shows, events, and local pet shops around the United States. </li>

<ul>
<li>People are passionate about their pets and we’re passionate about keeping them happy and safe. Critters need stimulation to keep them happy and engaged and mazes are the perfect outlet.  It can also act as a temporary and secure babysitter when you want them to be engaged but can’t be hands on.  Our modular maze system is reusable, expandable, washable, configurable, and stores away compactly. Because it is so incredibly flexible, there are almost unlimited expansion possibilities for our mazes. Everything from custom colors and art work to alternate products like board games for miniatures.  There are a lot of critter owners out there; over a half a million homes have pet rats - and that’s not counting the other critters like hamsters, mice and the like.  That's worth the effort!"".</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Details</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A Unit</strong> is a part the of a kit 2 bases, 4 walls, 4 columns<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>A kit</strong> has <strong>9 units</strong> (more units if you buy and add them)<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Critter Mazes has been designed by first time inventor and has a<strong> patent pending </strong>
</li>
<li>Your support will help get Critter Mazes up and running. Our relatively small start-up costs can produce thousands of parts and a deep starting inventory</li>
<li>This project is all about making a better environment for our smaller pets (rats, mice, hamsters and the like)!  Critters are smart, and since they get bored sitting in their cages all day, they need more stimulation and a safe place to explore and have fun.  </li>
<li><strong>You can help thousands of bored critters and feel good about it!</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Funding</strong> is going to tooling and then product making.  Secondary investments, sans funding, will be marketing and web presence, and more creative modular parts</li>
<li>
<strong>Start up is negligible</strong>: Tooling (the metal injection molds) is about $15,000; the plastic parts are about $12,000.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Maze is Modular</strong>: Modular is powerful. Each unit of the maze is comparable to a building block that attaches to the next block; this creates a sort of endless maze “possibility” both horizontal and <strong>vertical</strong>. 
<p><img alt=""Vertical rat maze"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/349198/pictures/full/20120723170606-2012-07-16_14-42-01_639a.jpg?1343088390"" src="""" style="""" title=""Vertical rat maze""/></p>
<ul>
<li>For example a 3x3 unit kit (9 units) could make up a horizontal square, a vertical square, a long line, an L shape, the famous T shape, or the customer’s own designs. The more units added, the larger the maze becomes, and thus endlessly customizable. Eventually we can add options for custom work, custom design and limited editions.</li>
</ul>

<strong>How this came about</strong>: I was looking for a basic “rat maze”. I went to stores, I searched on the internet and no matter where I looked I was unable to find one. I did find a tiny mouse maze (wrong size), a tube kit for hamsters (still not a maze and the wrong size), and a tube box combo thingy that was also too small and still not a maze. But even the toys I did find for rats didn’t have the configurability and possibility for unique and as exciting a design that a maze system has. There are about half a million homes that have rats as “pets” and even more homes that have other critters needing entertainment. 500 kits will be just .1% of that number!</li>
<li>
<strong>Niche Market</strong>: Being a part of a niche market can be a huge asset and this need is currently not being served.  We will be the only modular <strong>rat maze for sale</strong> on the internet and have the opportunity, time and passion to make it happen. Your contributions will help us serve this niche market by creating 500+ rat mazes &amp; a renewable business model.  Your help will create an ongoing long term business!

<p> </p></div>","Modular Critter Maze
-----------------------
 
 

We need your support launching this sustainable business.  We will be making and selling modular critter mazes for the retail environment.  Currently there are no rat-sized mazes for sale in stores or on the web (hamster tubes and mice mazes are both too small) so we see a great opportunity!

Your support for the relatively low start-up costs of the tooling and production of the parts, totaling approx. $25,000.  The metal mold tooling is a one-time cost just under $15,000, and the remainder of the funds will go towards the plastic, production costs, packaging, and marketing. Sales will be based mainly on the internet at crittermazes.com, eBay, Amazon, other online sites a well as trade shows, events, and local pet shops around the United States. 
           

People are passionate about their pets and we’re passionate about keeping them happy and safe. Critters need stimulation to keep them happy and engaged and mazes are the perfect outlet.  It can also act as a temporary and secure babysitter when you want them to be engaged but can’t be hands on.  Our modular maze system is reusable, expandable, washable, configurable, and stores away compactly. Because it is so incredibly flexible, there are almost unlimited expansion possibilities for our mazes. Everything from custom colors and art work to alternate products like board games for miniatures.  There are a lot of critter owners out there; over a half a million homes have pet rats - and that’s not counting the other critters like hamsters, mice and the like.  That's worth the effort!"".
 
Critter Maze Prototype KIT



Details


A Unit is a part the of a kit 2 bases, 4 walls, 4 columns


A kit has 9 units (more units if you buy and add them)



Critter Mazes has been designed by first time inventor and has a patent pending 

Your support will help get Critter Mazes up and running. Our relatively small start-up costs can produce thousands of parts and a deep starting inventory
This project is all about making a better environment for our smaller pets (rats, mice, hamsters and the like)!  Critters are smart, and since they get bored sitting in their cages all day, they need more stimulation and a safe place to explore and have fun.  
You can help thousands of bored critters and feel good about it!


Funding is going to tooling and then product making.  Secondary investments, sans funding, will be marketing and web presence, and more creative modular parts

Start up is negligible: Tooling (the metal injection molds) is about $15,000; the plastic parts are about $12,000.

The Maze is Modular: Modular is powerful. Each unit of the maze is comparable to a building block that attaches to the next block; this creates a sort of endless maze “possibility” both horizontal and vertical. 


For example a 3x3 unit kit (9 units) could make up a horizontal square, a vertical square, a long line, an L shape, the famous T shape, or the customer’s own designs. The more units added, the larger the maze becomes, and thus endlessly customizable. Eventually we can add options for custom work, custom design and limited editions.



How this came about: I was looking for a basic “rat maze”. I went to stores, I searched on the internet and no matter where I looked I was unable to find one. I did find a tiny mouse maze (wrong size), a tube kit for hamsters (still not a maze and the wrong size), and a tube box combo thingy that was also too small and still not a maze. But even the toys I did find for rats didn’t have the configurability and possibility for unique and as exciting a design that a maze system has. There are about half a million homes that have rats as “pets” and even more homes that have other critters needing entertainment. 500 kits will be just .1% of that number!

Niche Market: Being a part of a niche market can be a huge asset and this need is currently not being served.  We will be the only modular rat maze for sale on the internet and have the opportunity, time and passion to make it happen. Your contributions will help us serve this niche market by creating 500+ rat mazes & a renewable business model.  Your help will create an ongoing long term business!

""Made in USA"": Why? Because I was born on the 4th of July and while we live in a world economy, I live in the United States.

Bases: The bases have several cool design elements

Translucent material so we can watch our critters play
Doubles as ceilings
Interlocking design to create any size maze needed.
Special base for multilevel maze

Walls:  The walls have been designed with several elements

Will fit in any direction placed in between columns
Have holes designed into them to hold columns
Some are at 90 degree angle and some are at a 45 degree angle

<h3>So DailyBasics is an Underwear Company?</h3>
<p>DailyBasics is a premium online retailer which offers a curated selection of high quality men's products, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undershirts - Crew &amp; V-Neck</li>
<li>Socks - Dress &amp; Athletic</li>
<li>Underwear - Boxers &amp; Boxerbriefs</li>
</ul>
<p>Our mission: to ensure you feel fresh, comfortable and confident - inside and out! </p>
<p>We offer convenient, <strong>free delivery</strong> so you never have to run to the store again the night before a big event and overpay for undershirts at a department store or risk not finding your size.  Never run out of fresh undershirts again!  </p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Allison, Akshay and Dan didn't dream of starting a men's underwear company when they were little kids. But fate intervened. The three met in business school and discovered an epidemic: working professionals are busy, traveling frequently and always on the go. They hate to spend precious free time on weekends shopping for basics.</p>
<p>We are launching DailyBasics to solve this problem.  We've been working on this startup for the past year - going through many rounds of product samples to make sure they are excellent quality that we would want to provide to our own friends and family!  By backing our campaign, you will get to try our amazing products at a steep discount AND have the opportunity to support the community! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our crowdfunding goal  is to raise $10,000:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get excited!  By supporting us now, you can try our premium products at a steep discount. </li>
<li>Try our product bundles and sample several DailyBasics' products at once!  Refill your entire underwear drawer! <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Most of the money raised will go toward our first order of inventory. </strong></li>
<li>A small portion of funds will go toward expanding our product into extended sizes, so our products can be enjoyed by a greater audience - including those taller than 6'5"". <strong><i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>  </i></strong>

</div></div>","So DailyBasics is an Underwear Company?
DailyBasics is a premium online retailer which offers a curated selection of high quality men's products, including:

Undershirts - Crew & V-Neck
Socks - Dress & Athletic
Underwear - Boxers & Boxerbriefs

Our mission: to ensure you feel fresh, comfortable and confident - inside and out! 
We offer convenient, free delivery so you never have to run to the store again the night before a big event and overpay for undershirts at a department store or risk not finding your size.  Never run out of fresh undershirts again!  
Who We Are
Allison, Akshay and Dan didn't dream of starting a men's underwear company when they were little kids. But fate intervened. The three met in business school and discovered an epidemic: working professionals are busy, traveling frequently and always on the go. They hate to spend precious free time on weekends shopping for basics.
We are launching DailyBasics to solve this problem.  We've been working on this startup for the past year - going through many rounds of product samples to make sure they are excellent quality that we would want to provide to our own friends and family!  By backing our campaign, you will get to try our amazing products at a steep discount AND have the opportunity to support the community! 

What We Need & What You Get
Our crowdfunding goal  is to raise $10,000:

Get excited!  By supporting us now, you can try our premium products at a steep discount. 
Try our product bundles and sample several DailyBasics' products at once!  Refill your entire underwear drawer!  

Most of the money raised will go toward our first order of inventory. 
A small portion of funds will go toward expanding our product into extended sizes, so our products can be enjoyed by a greater audience - including those taller than 6'5"".

      don’t meet your needs in order to find what you are looking for?The New up and coming Search browser, 
        Meseek.com Is the solution for you!


Unlike the larger search engines, which focus on mass amounts of data, Meseek.com is designed to focus on the users specific data needs. Searches return customized results, that match search trends, page 
        ratings and liked sites instead of hundreds of pages filled with sites that are barely relevant and you will probably never actual view. 
 
Meseek.com offers its users a chance to customize their search results with its new T.I.E algorithm. Users can rate pages based on 
        relevance and usefulness as well as like and ignore search results. The search 
        engine will produce results to better match users’ requirements based on the 
        user’s site ratings and what users search most making it a completely intuitive 
        engine.

The more users that interact with the search engine the more customized and robust the results GROW based on what you search!

Rating a website result is easy as well! Once you have logged into your account a quick click on the number of stars, one through five, and the site is rated. You can easily change your assessments as well by simply clicking a different star rating. 
 

The site will remember your ratings and either produce more similar results or remove them from your search based on your rating!


If you don't want to take advantage of T.I.E to customize your results you don't have to... Simply search Meseek.com for your web results without creating an account.
Like most search engines, Meseek.com offers text and banner ad options for individuals and companies looking to promote their site online.

We hide Nothing unlike the other Giant search engines that make dubious claims...
Meseek’s PPC accounts allow those looking to place advertisements the ability to choose between text and banner ads to customize their cost-per-click ads and choose related keywords.



In order to keep the playing field even, the site pays out a staggering 51% of click share revenue to all publishers who are willing to place ads on their sites. This is quite a bit more than other companies, including Google’s AdSense... 
Publishers looking to sign up in order to earn money from ads can create a publisher’s account and set up what type of banners and text they are willing to allow on their site.
Meseek.com offers a great deal of customization and Publishers can chose to allow only text or banner ads on their sites, choose from a variety of color options and determine what size and shape ad will be displayed.

<p><i>Contemporary green designs and craftsmanship

<p>We are
an independent Canadian design project. Our passion lies in incorporating the
history of recycled material into beautiful and functional accessories.
Attention to detail, layers of history and ethics are present in each of our
creations. We believe in beautiful, unique, well-crafted designs made out of
sustainable materials. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/216898/files/20131122133955-workshop_pics_640.jpg?1385156395"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>We
(Willa and Sven) met around 5 1/2 years ago somewhere in the woods between
Ottawa and Toronto here in Canada. We grew quickly from small - time
bedroom production in rural Ontario into a successful design project. You can
find our designs in boutiques worldwide. We also design bags for the Mercedes
museum in Stuttgard and TEDx Talks.<span>  Most
importantly,  we continue to stick</span> to our
initial principals – making<span>  unique and
sustainable designs here in Canada.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/216900/files/20131122134019-workshop_pics2_640.jpg?1385156419"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p><h3><span><p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Why the campaign?<br/></b></b></h3>
<p></p></span></h3><p><span>
</span></p><p>With Indiegogo we want to give individuals the
wholesale price by creating a giant wholesale order. This way we are able to
give you a bag or a wallet at deep savings. When we've raised <b>$10K</b>, we
can make this happen. Each item will be handcrafted by us in Canada.</p>
<p>At <b>$30K,</b> we will able to bring Mariclaro one
step further and create an awesome new collection to offer you. You may be
thinking we will do this by outsourcing internationally, but rest assured--
none of the principles of how or why we produce items will change, and they
will continue to be made by our same standards, in Canada. </p>
<p></p><h3><span><p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><h3><b>Our commitment</b></h3></b></b></h3>
<p></p></span></h3><p><span>
</span></p><p>Our fundamental outlook is that life and beauty depend on how we use our
resources. </p>
<p>We believe that design and innovation can have a
positive effect on the environment. Hence, we need to be intelligent in the
ways we use our resources here on planet earth. That’s why we are committed to
designing new items from quality material that will extend the lifetime of the
initial material, and last for another lifetime. We have found that by using
the luxurious leathers and upholsteries from cars, we are able to create high-
quality and extremely durable accessories.<span> Our products have a unique
history, and reflect our commitment to the environment.</span></p>
<p>We have been doing this for the last 5 years, and
will continue to explore the path of sustainable design.<span>  To realize ideas which are seen as improbable
involves risk. It’s not the easy way, by
far, but we are committed to design, and our environment, and so we boldly
continue.  </span></p>

<p></p></span></h1><p><span>
</span></p><p>All
the items we present in our Indiegogo campaign are handmade by us from the original car seat material of classic cars like
Mercedes, Cadillac, Honda, and Volvo . </p>
<p>Using car leather is not
only cool, but it extends the lifecycle of the leather another decade!</p>
<p>The first step of making the bags and wallets is
sourcing the materials. Every week, we are on the hunt for the leathers of old
luxury cars in scrap yards all over Ontario. After sourcing the material, we
clean it and organize it by car brand
and color. </p>

Now
begins the designing and sewing. Because the materials are specific to the car they
originated from, every item needs special attention. We carefully select the
materials for each bag, and join the pieces together in ways inspired by how
they come out of the vehicle. We combine the car seat leather with high quality
69 nylon thread, 600 denier polyester liner, and metal hardware to assure their
long life time. And that’s what you get – a one- of-a- kind piece designed to
last a decade.

<p>Simply check out the perks and choose the one you like best! For each perk, we have a chart showing
the available colors and associated car brands. When you get one, we will send an
order form where you will choose the colour you wish. Due to the nature of the
material, we cannot promise the specific car and colour combination before they
are made, but you will have the chance to rate your preferences of car model 1
to 3 (1= gold, 3 is bronze) and we will send your item in this range.<span>  </span></p>

After

less material in landfills. Together we can make this happen!

</div></div>","The Perfect Work Companion to the Modern Day Briefcase

We have designed a bag that makes hitting the gym before or after work easier. As an attorney, it was difficult to fit exercise into my chaotic schedule. We have designed a bag that keeps everything you need for your day organized and clean, so you can easily fit the gym in before, during, or after work. 

 

FEATURES
The Everyday Duffle is designed to make your life easier by helping you keep your clean clothes ready for work and your dirty clothes isolated from the rest of your gear. The everyday duffle comes in three color options.  We've designed the bag with two shoe pockets: one for your dirty gym shoes, and another one for your work shoes. The bag also has a roll garment bag to keep clothes from getting wrinkled, a dopp kit for your bathroom essentials, a waterproof laundry bag for your dirty clothes, two external pockets, and four internal pockets.
 
Available In Three Colors
 
Two Shoe Compartments - One for Gym Shoes and One for Dress Shoes
 

 
Keep Your Work Shoes Separate From Your Gym Shoes
 
Two Vents on Each Shoe Pocket For Sufficient Ventilation
 
Garment Roll Bag
 
Easy to Pack and Easy to Store
 
 
Keep Your Clothes Ready For Work
 
Laundry Bag
 
 
Two External Pockets
 
Four Internal Pockets For Additional Storage
 
Four Internal Pockets
 
Four Internal Pockets
  

MATERIALS
To make sure that the Everyday Duffle is durable and will last, we started with the highest grade materials.
The leather on this bag is vegetable tanned leather that is sourced from one of the oldest and most respected Italian tanneries in the world.  This leather is durable and will age beautifully with each additional use. 
For the exterior of the bag, we chose a 10 oz. waxed cotton to make the bag water resistant and durable. In addition, we used the most reliable zippers on the market, YKK zippers, to ensure that the bag will last.
Luxurious Italian Vegetable Tanned Leather
 
Using Old World Tannery Techniques
 
Durable 10 oz Waxed Cotton
 
10 Ounce Waxed Cotton: Classic, Durable, and Water Resistant
 
YKK Zippers Designed to Last
 

DESIGN
When we started designing the Everyday Duffle, we wanted to have a great looking bag that was also functional and easy to use.  After numerous iterations, we were able to incorporate the functionality we needed for everyday use into a great looking bag.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>People have been raving about Zubits magnetic lacing solution since we first created them four years ago. Now we are offering them on Indiegogo for the best prices anywhere. </p>
<p>We invented magnetic shoe closures out of our garage in California. Some Chinese knockoffs have tried to copy what we do, but their quality and strength are so poor that they are useless to use.  They are just not strong enough to actually work.</p>
<p>We've had so many positive reviews and supportive feedback from people of all walks of life. From runners, kids, elders, hikers, triathletes, adults, arthritis sufferers, gadget fans, gym goers, people with autism, occupational therapists, cross-fit buffs, moms, and everyone in between, they've told us how much they love their Zubits closures.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We will be ready to ship</h3>
<p>Your support will help us have the funds for another production run.  We should be able to deliver as soon as the campaign is ended or very soon after.  </p>
<p>We have shipped thousands of Zubits closures before, both in the USA and all parts of the world, so we do not expect any delays or problems.  See the pictures at the bottom of packaged Zubits closures that are ready to ship.</p>
<p>Get your perks at the lowest price found anywhere!!</p>
<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>How can Zubits closures be easy to step out of, but stay on securely when I run?</strong><ol><li>The force when you step on your heel with your opposite foot is very strong. So the Zubits magnets will separate when you do this. Consider that even with your regular shoelaces double-knotted, you can still step on your heel and squeeze out of your shoes because this action generates a lot of force. People do it all the time. But when you run, your shoes still stay on. When you run, the shoelaces are mostly lifting the weight of your shoe. Zubits are engineered to be incredibly strong for their size. Zubits can hold your shoe secure while running and jumping, but they will split open when you step on your heel because the forces are much greater.</li></ol>

Zubits work great on boots. There is a little challenge on boots with speed laces (no holes up top) but there are work-around to make them work. Hard sole shoes like soccer or baseball shoes can also cause the Zubits closures to pop open from time to time. Please choose size #3 Zubits for the most secure hold.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Do Zubits magnets hold securely?</strong><ol><li>Running, going to the gym, riding a bike, playing at the playground, and most recreational sports activities won’t be a problem for most users of Zubits. Zubits have been designed to be much stronger than normal neodymium magnets alone. They are designed to hold your shoe securely during use, while still being easy enough to pop off when your done. Therefore, Zubits are offered in different sizes to reach a balance between secure use and easy release. So if you ever have concerns about performance, we recommend you choose the next stronger size Zubits than would normally be recommended for you. The stronger size magnets are not that much harder to pop off. My large male friends have used Zubits for running and the gym with no problems. Zubits are designed for casual shoes and recreational sports, so there are some high-level sports in which Zubits could separate under extreme movement or by larger individuals. If high performance is of great importance, again, choose the size #3 Zubits or if you are a large individual, consider not purchasing Zubits for that activity. The variables that affect Zubits are heavy individuals, extreme movements or flexing, and particularly stiff soled shoes. Zubits are usually not recommended for hard-sole athletic cleats used for soccer match play, High School football, or organized sports. When my 6’5” 235lb friend made hard running cuts on grass with his stiff soccer cleats, the Zubits popped open about 5% of the time. So this is why we can’t say they work on all people and all shoes all the time. In any situation, loosening the laces just a little greatly helps prevent them from splitting during activity.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Will I come home with nails stuck to my shoes?</strong><ol><li>No. Zubits closures have been specifically designed to greatly reduce any external magnetism emitting from the plastic casing of the Zubits. Nearly all the magnetism is directed toward the closing face of the magnet. It is difficult to stick even a small screw to the side of a Zubit. We have just never seen this be a problem in actual use. And you won't come home with nails stuck to your shoe. Of course, if you separate the magnets, metal will certainly stick to the face of the magnet, but it’s no problem to slide something off. In the video, when we hang the shoes to a metal object, this is being done by the face of the magnets, not with the Zubits closed.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Can Zubits pinch fingers?</strong><ol><li>Zubits rarely pinch fingers in normal use, but a pinched finger is possible and can sometimes cause some pain. People need to grab the outside of the magnets to pull them together. Thus users rarely place their fingers where the magnets join. Putting a child’s whole finger between even the strongest adult size magnets only “holds” a finger with no discomfort. That being said, a child can play with the Zubits and it can be possible to get the side of a finger pinched. We recommend that parents do the installation. When our own children play with our the magnets and get pinched (we have had many laying around the house), they are more startled than hurt and they continue playing with the magnets anyways ignoring the discomfort. Adult fingers are generally too thick and tough for much pinching to occur.</li></ol>

<ol><li><p>Every country has their own Duty or VAT tax policy, some charge it and some do not.

We hope that you don't get charged, but if you do, you are supporting your country's services. It is your responsibility to know and pay to import a product into your country. And legally, Zubits cannot list a purchased product as a ""gift"" or with a dollar amount below the purchase price. That's just the laws we are required to follow.</p></li></ol>

Summary
People have been raving about Zubits magnetic lacing solution since we first created them four years ago. Now we are offering them on Indiegogo for the best prices anywhere. 
We invented magnetic shoe closures out of our garage in California. Some Chinese knockoffs have tried to copy what we do, but their quality and strength are so poor that they are useless to use.  They are just not strong enough to actually work.
We've had so many positive reviews and supportive feedback from people of all walks of life. From runners, kids, elders, hikers, triathletes, adults, arthritis sufferers, gadget fans, gym goers, people with autism, occupational therapists, cross-fit buffs, moms, and everyone in between, they've told us how much they love their Zubits closures.

We will be ready to ship
Your support will help us have the funds for another production run.  We should be able to deliver as soon as the campaign is ended or very soon after.  
We have shipped thousands of Zubits closures before, both in the USA and all parts of the world, so we do not expect any delays or problems.  See the pictures at the bottom of packaged Zubits closures that are ready to ship.

Frequently Asked Questions


How can Zubits closures be easy to step out of, but stay on securely when I run?The force when you step on your heel with your opposite foot is very strong. So the Zubits magnets will separate when you do this. Consider that even with your regular shoelaces double-knotted, you can still step on your heel and squeeze out of your shoes because this action generates a lot of force. People do it all the time. But when you run, your shoes still stay on. When you run, the shoelaces are mostly lifting the weight of your shoe. Zubits are engineered to be incredibly strong for their size.

<h3><b>The Story of <i>in.joy</i></b></h3>
<p><i>The Who-Ha of where I came from and where I'd like to go...</i></p>
<p>I'm an artist who loves to work with my hands. I've been making art since I was a little girl, always crafting up something new. Whether it was making a new outfit to wear out of extra material or beading a new pair of earrings from scratch, there was never a shortage of creativity involved. I loved to paint as a child, still do! All of this led me to where I am today as a Wardrobe Stylist and a Jewelry Designer. This campaign however is specific to my Jewelry line. <br/></p>
<p>in.joy launched in 2009 after taking several metalsmithing classes and embarking on a journey that led me to Bali, Indonesia. After launching my website in late 2012, I've been really excited to get the online store up and running. This is where i came to a road block...</p>
<p>By simply just asking for your support I have already accomplished a huge part of my goal; being vulnerable enough and willing to ask for help! However, your monetary support would truly make my thoughts become my reality. <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>With your help and support, I will be able to fully fund this adventure </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>to create my jewelry, have it  be available online and move forward towards furthering the success of my business. <br/></p>

<p>The number ""29"" is very specific to how it relates to me personally at this stage in my life as I enter into a new phase of my growth and development. Yet, still being realistic about what I need to get the first line made, produced &amp; available for purchase online, I am looking to raise $2,900. The money goes directly towards the purchasing of all materials needed (metal, stones, wax)  as well as for the labor to produce the pieces in multiple quantities.<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>I love jewelry myself which is why making it myself is so rewarding. As a supporter to this campaign, the rewards and perks are very exciting. As an example, you get more for your buck by joining the cause then by purchasing an individual piece. As a sponsor and mini backer, you reap the benefits by owning your own pieces at no additional cost to what you contribute. I want you to feel as rewarded as I do when I make a piece of jewelry and witness how much appreciation and love the recipient feels after receiving the gift. <br/></p>

<p>Magzook was born on a highway.</p>
<p>While riding his motorcycle through Michigan, Devin found the cuff of his pants blowing up and exposing his legs, which resemble that of a yeti. He thought there'd already be a product on the market to remedy this annoyance, and he quickly found something to meet his needs, purchased it online, and hit the open road. This overpriced solution quickly failed, and he knew that he could create something of higher quality at a lower price point.</p>

<p>Not having a clue how to sew, the first prototype was made using copper wire, elastic nylon, two magnets and a metal clip. Seeing that it worked, he asked his grandma to teach him how to sew using her antique 1951 Singer Sewing Machine. Armed with a few metal clips, some spare webbing, and four magnets, he created the first pair of bootstraps called MagStraps. He soon realized the tightening system could be applied to other products, and after days of stitching and fine tuning the MagBelt  came to life.</p>

Just plug it in to start brushing your curls straight.It’s that simple. 
   
 ALL Types of Hair 
Curly, wavy, frizzy. All fabulous. All VAVOO-able.  It’s like that thing you saw once... Only this one's much, MUCH better.    
 Features 
 But our favorite feature is the most obvious one. Unlike some of the other ones you find on the shelf today, it works, and it works extremely well. It also comes with a 1-year warranty. Just in case anything goes awry. 
 Full 360° Heat Safety 
 VAVOO's protective back is made from temperature resistant coating. Because what's cooler than being cool? Not getting burned. 
 Just the Right Temperature for YOUR Hair 


Hair isn't one-size fits all. Different hair types require different temperature levels.That's why VAVOO lets you adjust the heat to find your perfection.Anywhere from 338°-410°F (170°-210°C) 
  VAVOO: A Look Inside  
 VAVOO massively minimizes risk and severity of hair damage even in the long term.Because it's made from quality components, not whatever was least expensive. 
 A Travelling Gal’s Best Friend 
Look great no matter where you go.Comes with standard US plug (EU & UK & AUS plugs available too, we'll ask before delivery)Universal product (110w-220w power)Cautionary safety regulations ( ETL & CETL safety certificates) 
 The Finest Material: Ceramic Coated Plate 
 You don't apply cheap and potentially harmful cream to your skin...So how can you trust your hair with anything but the best? 
 What’s in the VAVOO Box 
  
1 VAVOO (with a plug fit for your regional outlets)
A manual (with your warranty information) & safety certificates
That's it. You don’t need anything else. No serums, no creams, nothin'. 
 Some Photos from the Process 
We started with some frustration at the current state of so-called straightener brushes, and overcame it with a stubborn mission of creating one that's awesome.  Then we researched by buying all the straightener brushes we could find, and reverse engineered them to find their shortcuts and issues.In the meantime, we also interviewed lots and lots of girls with all sorts of hair to find out what was most important in a straightener brush.  Sometimes it wasn't in the words they said, but in the way their face shined when they saw a feature or touched a button. After that came designing and engineering and lots of tweaking and testing, finding the right manufacturers, and now we have an amazing prototype that works amazingly. 
 And Now, It's Like THIS 
 
 Why We Created VAVOO 
 One day, while eating breakfast together, Dan's girlfriend Viki was trying to straighten her hair with a straightener brush she was convinced to buy at the mall after seeing the woman use it on a wig.Problem was, when she got home and tried to straighten her own hair, it didn't quite work, or work at all. Being the great boyfriend he is, Dan tried to help her figure it out, but quickly got super-frustrated. Being an entrepreneurial, solution-finding kinda guy, he called up his best friend Mor, and they got right to work. They didn't really pick their head up until... VAVOO.We hope you love it as much as Viki and our other testers do, and thanks for supporting us.                        Mor, VAVOO Co-founder & CEO.                                    
 Back VAVOO with Trust 
 This isn't one of those hopeful, amateur-ish crowdfunding campaigns. This is a sure thing, ""a there's no way we sleep until it's in your hands"" kind-of-thing.Why are we so confident?We finished up the prototype and it's ready to go.  We have everything already set up and ready to go as soon as we hit GO.We also have 7 years of intense eCommerce experience, and have developed and sold a few products already. That helps too.Oh, and then there's the fact that we're super-confident this is the best, highest quality straightener brush.

<p>In order to make this project a success, we need to achieve a certain level of production. Top tier buyers and press need to be ""wowed"" and entertained with new and exciting events. It takes the right venue, the right entertainment, and professionalism all around. Only so many of these things come free.</p>
<p>Curious about where your sponsor dollars are going? Here is a short list:</p>

The Burlesque Boudoir - Fashion Week

Starbaby Enterprises is celebrating it's one year anniversary by kicking off New York Fashion Week (NYFW) with their new production, The Burlesque Boudoir. 
The New York City based marketing company continues to provide a unique Fashion Week Experience for both the public and industry members.
New York Fashion Week is a private, industry-only occasion, that happens twice a year, and Starbaby Enterprises wants to include all fashion followers and devotees to a luxury event that allows everyone to feel like a VIP Guest.
This event will take place on September 4, 2014 at Opus 51 in New York City, featuring a live lingerie fashion show and burlesque performance, showcasing designs by up and coming UK Designer Louise Ferdinand Lingerie and Celebrity Designer Stevie Boi Shades. 

As one of Starbaby Enterprises' goals is to provide top tier PR and production to entrepreneurial designers, we are providing  Louise Ferdinand with the unique opportunity to have her first runway show in New York City during Fashion Week.


In addition to providing the fashionable entertainment, for this event, Starbaby Enterprises has aligned themselves with the amazing breast cancer charity, Walk the Walk America.This innovative organization works around the globe raising awareness and funding for different breast cancer research and survivor support initiatives.  


A Bit About The Company
Starbaby Enterprises was founded in 2013 by Actress and entrepreneur, Jordan Elizabeth Gelber. After working for several years in marketing and PR for both the fashion and entertainment industry, Jordan felt stifled and demotivated. She was stuck in positions that didn't fully utilize her strengths, leaving her unable to realize her full potential. 
Noticeably, there were many in the same position, and Jordan ventured out on her own to correct this by providing an individualized brand marketing strategy to aid others to be successful in their chosen field.
Our typical client is someone in either the fashion or entertainment industry, who is both talented and motivated, but may not have all the resources to reach their desired business objectives.

Many of our clients are often working solo on their ventures, and may not have the branding experience, funding, or PR network to get noticed. 


The process is to make ourselves available to these individuals and figure out what their business identity, goals, and budgets are. After a thorough evaluation, we create high caliber projects and/or marketing campaigns, like The Burlesque Boudoir, to give them the brand presence they so badly deserve at a reasonable investment.


Every client and project we take on is treated with the utmost care and respect. Whether it be a solo venture who is working two other jobs to support their new clothing line, or a great charitable cause, our number one goal is to make their venture's future a better one.
   Your donation and where it goes Starbaby Enterprises works with a vast network of like-minded partners and affiliates. However, some projects require us to branch out of our network and secure production assets that still require funding. That's where you, our beloved sponsors and investors, come in. 
In order to make this project a success, we need to achieve a certain level of production. Top tier buyers and press need to be ""wowed"" and entertained with new and exciting events. It takes the right venue, the right entertainment, and professionalism all around. Only so many of these things come free.
Curious about where your sponsor dollars are going? Here is a short list:

Production for the Fashion Show (ex. lighting, chairs, hair, makeup team)
Models 
Burlesque Dancers & Entertainment
Printed Marketing Materials (flyers, step & repeat, programs)
Virtually and Digitally Based Marketing (Social Media Campaign Sites, Marketing Services)
Venue Rental & Bar Guarantee
20% of your donation goes directly to Walk The Walk America


  The Challenge  As mentioned, our biggest challenge is getting the right audience to attend the event. We work incredibly hard to put on an enticing show for fashion media and buyers. Once we get them in, it is a guaranteed home run. We have a tried and true business model that has proven its success with past events such Janique Fashion Week, LQUID Launch Party, and the Heavenly Sinful Spring Fling; all of which you can read more about on our Company Facebook Page


  Other Ways You Can Help Don't feel that a monetary donation is for you? We understand. Do us a favor and help share our project with others. Send them to our event page at The Burlesque Boudoir - Fashion Week or our Facebook event page.",1.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Roger started his fashion career designing clothes for both men and women with fine fabrics directly from Kenya and the Ivory Coast. His dedication to offering innovative styles in the highest- quality fabrics allowed him to build a strong client base.  Soon after, Roger expanded into European styled clothes to meet customer demands. As the business ""kept growing"" Roger decided to focus on men's fashion which lead into the opening of Roger's Menswear. Roger had found his niche catering to men sizes medium to 6X.</p>
<p><i> ""It seemed like I was the only retailer in this region that was catering to the taller gentleman. Since then that has been my niche, supplying a quality dressing experience to men who are most times directed to that small section in the back of the store labeled BIG &amp; TALL."" </i></p>
<p>In 2008 the economy hit a tough road which caused Roger to close his business, but this was only to be temporary. Some clients and customers would later see Roger throughout the years and ask about the business and when would he begin again. It wasn't until Shaneka, his eldest daughter, returned from fashion school that ignited the spark to build this collection and manufacturing company.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">All about Sustainability</h2>
<p>Change is the only option to sustain our world and that starts with being aware that every purchasing choice can make a difference. We are committed to genuine sustainability. Our jackets are bought with the Fairwear Foundation label (Corporate Social Responsibility) and have high standard certifications (GOTS, OCS 100, OCS Blended, OEKO TEX, REACH) to prove our commitment to sustainability. You can read about the Fairwear Foundation here <a href=""http://www.fairwear.org/22/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.fairwear.org/22/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fairwear.org/22/about/.</a></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">For the spirit of giving</h3>
<p>Here, in our town in Germany, we have many refugees from Syria. In the spirit of giving, while so many have given to me, I would like to offer to also give. If my fundraising efforts are met I would like to donate 10 jackets to our local refugees here. I did not originally intend to do this, but realise that for sustainability we also need to sustain the human spirit. Always give forward.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Stickt Jackets</h3> <p>When my first daughter was born I started my first business with my mom, selling handmade european wool diaper covers (handmade by me <a href=""http://www.humbird.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.humbird.eu</a>).  My second business, Stickt, is all about creating quality crafted jackets that reflect what an individual you are.  Stickt is my passion for creating jackets that look good and made with quality materials by people that are fairly treated. It is difficult to find a really nice looking zipped hoodie that is original,  looks good, and is manufactured helping protect the Earth and its people. </p>

</div></div>","All about Sustainability
Change is the only option to sustain our world and that starts with being aware that every purchasing choice can make a difference. We are committed to genuine sustainability. Our jackets are bought with the Fairwear Foundation label (Corporate Social Responsibility) and have high standard certifications (GOTS, OCS 100, OCS Blended, OEKO TEX, REACH) to prove our commitment to sustainability. You can read about the Fairwear Foundation here http://www.fairwear.org/22/about/.

For the spirit of giving
Here, in our town in Germany, we have many refugees from Syria. In the spirit of giving, while so many have given to me, I would like to offer to also give. If my fundraising efforts are met I would like to donate 10 jackets to our local refugees here. I did not originally intend to do this, but realise that for sustainability we also need to sustain the human spirit. Always give forward.
Stickt Jackets When my first daughter was born I started my first business with my mom, selling handmade european wool diaper covers (handmade by me www.humbird.eu).  My second business, Stickt, is all about creating quality crafted jackets that reflect what an individual you are.  Stickt is my passion for creating jackets that look good and made with quality materials by people that are fairly treated. It is difficult to find a really nice looking zipped hoodie that is original,  looks good, and is manufactured helping protect the Earth and its people. 
Join us today.
We create jackets that represent you.  

                               
Funds will go towards:
1.  Very high quality multi-needle embroidery machine that will allow larger quantities to be produced due to the shortened time needed and produce a better stitch. 
2. The set up of a new website. The domain www.sticktclothing.com is already owned by Stickt.
3. A set of Fairwear Foundation jackets to begin creating a Stickt jacket.
Perks:
$25-Key Fob


   $50-Limited Edition Stickt Shirt

Together they are firmly rooting the company’s philosophy in sustainability and quality design.With current collaborations in Los Angeles, Brazil and Chile, the goal is to create a network of artisans abroad who sustain the craft of their indigenous artisanal traditions including, South America, South-east Asia, and Africa. The brass screw is a signature mark detailing every piece of Cor Madeira product. It is symbolic of the company’s foundation, rooted in the construction of a sustainable, eco-chic planet.Philosophy ::Cor Madeira's signature collection, Entwine, aims to create a social awareness that evokes a philosophy inspired by Mexican philosopher, Jose Vasconcelos. He believed that cultures are intermingling and becoming a 'new human type', even possibly soon to be one race. In the braiding of different up-cycled materials coming from different regions of the world, We showcase our Entwine as a campaign in support of his theory. The screw detail signing every Cor Madeira piece, is to remind us of our connectedness to one another, together constructing one race.“…the distinct races of the world tend to mix more and more until they form a new human type composed of a selection from each of existent lands”

In “Vasoncelos of Mexico.” John H. Haddox cites Vasconcelos’ theory of the mingled race in the preface of “La Raza Cosmica,(qtd. Vasconcelos 53).
What we need (the specifics)...
The $10,000 breakdown


20% to incorportate as an LLC. and complete licensing and trademarks


15% to do Couer trade show for Fall 2014 (this takes place in february/march 2014)

15% to expand our marketing campaign through brand exposure (packaging, collateral material, photoshoots)

20% to buy needed tools for the workshop (carpentry and metalsmithing)


5% to broaden our network of designers, creating an artists collective to strengthen the CM platform25% to expand production by finding helping hands abroad who are already trained in their indigenous artisanal traditions.0% to spread the philosophy of UNITY


Why we need it...They said be transparent, so here we go...
Cor Madeira is a dream of ours... but more than just a dream, we believe it's mission. We truly believe in the social impact this accessory line can have. But we sincerely need your help to make it happen.Between the two of us, we have a lot of very valuable skills that can take this company far with low overhead cost.Half of the story ::
Lisette has over 10 years experience as an apparel/accessory designer and stylist. She knows her materials and has 75% of the tools to create with them. (hopefully after reaching our goal, we can gather the other 25) 
With the relationships she has made over the years in the fashion industry, she has collected a powerful group of friends and fashionistas willing to help her in her dream..... And although her huge artillery of skills are available for trade (from metal-smithing to styling to photography) there only so many favors you can ask. Right? 
Well, since Lisette was already seasoned in fashion design, she decided to go back to school and strengthen her foundation with a marketing degree. Sounds great right!? Well, it will be... The problem she is JUST finishing her return to school. 
What does that mean? STARVING STUDENT!!... and more hungry than ever. This is where you guys come in :)
The other half ::
Danielle also has over 10 experience as an fine artist/designer. She attended OTIS College of Art and Design before she decided to travel to Brazil the first time and volunteer her time teaching art to children. She has on-going project called Universal Pigment, that donates art supplies to existing children's programs abroad. Her desire is strong to make a social impact for the better.
Danielle has also had the fortunate opportunity to oversee production for an American based jewelry company in Brazil, who uphold some of the same standards in sustainability and fair trade that CM hold. These connections and experience are  a priceless piece of the Cor Madeira Puzzle as well.
Danielle is formally trained as a painter but has been working as a graphic artist for the past two years. She is currently juggling her time between freelance assignments and Cor Madeira. 
What does this mean? STARVING ARTIST!!... and more hungry than ever. THIS IS WHERE YOU GUYS COME IN :) :)WE NEED YOUR HELP!!
We wouldn't be asking if we didn't sincerely need help. We whole-heartedly believe in the social change we can all create in the wearing of these accessories. But it is going to take many of us together, and build.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Latex clothing is gaining popularity in fashion magazines, a lot in part due to celebrities like Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna. Until now, there hasn't been ready-to-wear latex designs that are easy to wear and take care of. Pretty Thoughts plans on changing the course of fashion history, and needs your help!</p>
<p>My name is Erica Templeman, and I am the owner and designer of Pretty Thoughts, a clothing company that specializes in mainstream, ready-to-wear latex clothing. My campaign is to raise money to purchase a fume hood, to assist with the continuing growth my company is experiencing. I've expanded quickly in the past two years since I begun Pretty Thoughts--my debut fashion show at Boston Fashion Week 2011, the Spring/Summer 2012 fashion show at the international Rockabilly rendezvous Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekender 15, and following up with the addition of plus sizing and the Spring/Summer 2013 line debuting at Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekender 16. My designs are available for sale on Karmaloop.com's Kazbah, a site for their independent designers, as well as my Etsy shop and I take custom orders via email. I have been working hard adding plus sizing debuting November 2012 as well as new designs tailored to the extended sizing, and planning next year's engagements that are pushing my limited budget to it's maximum potential.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise $2,500 to assist with the purchase of a fume hood. One of the many reasons that Pretty Thoughts is different from other latex designers is the specialized finishing process that makes the latex clothing easier to wear as well as care for. Chlorination as it is called, requires the mixing of hydrochloric acid and bleach diluted in water. It produces chlorine gas, which is deadly if inhaled. While I use respirators, chemical safety gloves, and goggles, the process still requires me to perform it outside, which becomes exceptionally limiting with the unpredictable New England weather. With a small ductless fume hood and the correct HEPA filters, I would be able to perform the process inside. </p>
<p><strong>What *you* get out of funding Pretty Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>-Everyone who donates, regardless of amount, will be listed as a donor on the Pretty Thoughts Website and will receive my undying gratitude.</p>
<p>-Donate $10 and get special 5"" x 7"" print on glossy cardstock signed by the designer with a personalized thank you note on the back.</p>
<p>-Donate $25, get a wall calendar featuring gorgeous models in Pretty Thoughts designs as well as the 5""x7"" print thank you note.</p>
<p>-Donate $50, and get all of the above, and a set of 4 hairbows in the Spring/Sumer 2013 colors before they are available to the public</p>
<p>-Donate $100, and get all of the above, and you get to give a name to one of my Spring/Summer 2013 designs.</p>
<p>-Donate $500, and get all of the above, and you get a behind the scenes tour of the Boston studio, as well as lunch with me to collaborate on upcoming designs/colors. Travel to Boston not included.</p>
<p>-Donate $1000 and get all of the above, and you get to come to and be in a photoshoot! You will be invited on the set of a Pretty Thoughts photoshoot and you will receive star treatment and be in a Pretty Thoughts photoshoot. Travel to Boston, MA not included.</p>
<p>****For international sponsors, please add $2 to assist with shipping costs for prints, and $5 for calendars and hairbows****</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Pretty Thoughts is changing the course of fashion as we know it. Latex clothing is commonly used as a futuristic fabric in costuming, and is gaining popularity in fashion magazines. There's also a lot of interest in latex clothing thanks to celebrities, but until now, there hasn't been ready-to-wear latex designs that are easy to wear and take care of. It's a flattering material for most body types, smoothing you out and holding you in. My designs are also designed for the most comfortable wear while being fashionable-- like the flirty kickpleat skirt, the fun bustier and the adorable babydoll dress. It's no different than wearing other fine fabrics or materials, such as silk, satin, or leather, and is significantly easier to take care of!</p>

<p>If you were told that the outfit you are wearing has more meaning such as creating jobs, inspiring innovation and celebrating with a whole group of people from another country, other than just a manufactured piece of item in a factory, will you feel more confident to buy and wear it?</p>
<p> I have two major goals: <br/> 1) To awaken the sleeping giant of fashion that lies in the continent of Africa by creating meaningful, trendy, contemporary fashion that carries the beauty of love, culture and diversity using the finest African traditional garments and fabric, that is usually worn on special occasions by African royalty. Starting with the Toghu, a traditional regalia worn by the royalty and on special occasions by the Tikar people of the North west Region and the Bamileke.<br/> 2) To give you confidence, poise and value with an added sense of adequacy with every piece of my creation. I want people to wear my creation with a justified amount of boldness and humility leaving behind a feeling of sharing and belonging. <br/> So far, the people wearing my fashion label without knowing have contributed to celebrating with the African people, bringing dreams alive, creating jobs for the indigenous in west Africa and waking up the sleeping fashion industry in Africa. </p>
<p>By us adding value and modernizing the ""toghu"" Many Cameroonian designers have been inspired on how to further exploit this rich culture hence creating more fashions and jobs.<br/> I need your help to change more lives, create more jobs and wake up the African fashion Industry. Your donations will not only make this possible but it will also be a part of creating history. <br/><br/> In just a few years we have been able to build a great following due to our ground breaking work, playing a big role in lots of shows around the world, creating a lot of interest and awareness on our brand.We received major recognition from media giants like the BBC and New African Woman. This attracted the attention Cameroon officials and we had our first major contract in 2010 to create special contemporary outfits for the Cameroonian delegation to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.</p>
<p><br/> This phase was either the great beginning or the great end for our career in fashion. We plunged into the job determined to bring out the best for our nation so we could be fashionably represented at the world cup. This sweet dream turned sour when we realized our work went all in vain. Until this day, we did not receive up to ¼ of the payments though we supplied the goods and on time to our buyers. <br/> Failure is inevitable when you are in the process of creating something big and worthwhile. We did not stop at the first major failure and we will not stop now. Like it is said, if you haven’t failed then you have not really tried. I will keep trying and that is why I need your help. <br/> This was the turning point in my life - debts, loss of trust from our friends, deception, confusion, frustration. Many things came to an end. After all our hard work turned into failure, my first partnership business went bankrupt, ending the partnership and losing some fans and clients - The company that was built on young and vibrant inspirations that brought together thousands of young people around the world to dare, to be bold and face their future courageously especially in the creative world. However my partner and I chose to but as the beginning of a new and beautiful day. Instead of one, we now have two amazing fashion innovations thriving in two different parts of the world and we are both grateful for the tough times and proud of our new birth. <br/> Today an even more amazing company is born – KibonenNY of which I am very proud. <br/> Kibonen NY did not go far from the original concepts. The Toghu still stays primordial – Putting Cameroons own pride and culture on the high fashion scene, working with other African prints and luxurious textiles to create a fresh fusion of rich contemporary styles, fabrics and trends is all of what makes this brand truly unique. <br/> Besides being a fashion lifestyle brand, KibonenǀNY is an ethical fashion brand. Cameroon is a country with abundant talent, unbelievable design aesthetics, amazing and beautiful people yet over 49% of the population live below the poverty line. This was another gripping factor that urged the formation of my brand - using the business of fashion to help create employment in Cameroon, paying employees a fair wage that will not only aid survival but allow them to improve their standard of living. <br/> After realizing the potential that ethical fashion could provide. <br/> KibonenNY together with some partners formed the Cameroon Fashion Common Initiative Group and instigated the start up of an ethical factory - “Made In Camer”, which today is an independent, charity based, eco and ethical clothing production unit that supports local talent and provides employment to Cameroonians in one of the poorest communities. Made in Camer aims to create a sustainable and creative long term solution to Cameroons economic crisis by putting forward community driven, ethical and environmentally friendly trade in fashion. The bigger aim for Made in Camer is to have many other local and international designers as well as other companies with specific production needs produce from Cameroon and distribute on an international level.</p>
<p><strong>The great news for us today is that it is very possible. </strong><br/> KibonenNY has been selected to take part in the prestigious<strong> </strong><strong>Mercedes Benz Fashion Week in South Africa.</strong> This is every fashion designers dream and one of my Dreams come True. This is a major visibility platform that comes with amazing opportunities</p>
<p>With all the excitement, <strong>I am kindly asking for your support to help make KibonenNY the revolution it seeks to be not just a piece of clothing to wear but an innovation that seeks to implement a substantial improvement in the lives of many whose voices have been drowned by the forces of nature, pressure and lack of proper resources.</strong> You will not only be wearing a beautiful piece of creation, you will be giving back to the world and making it a better place.</p>

 I have two major goals:  1) To awaken the sleeping giant of fashion that lies in the continent of Africa by creating meaningful, trendy, contemporary fashion that carries the beauty of love, culture and diversity using the finest African traditional garments and fabric, that is usually worn on special occasions by African royalty. Starting with the Toghu, a traditional regalia worn by the royalty and on special occasions by the Tikar people of the North west Region and the Bamileke. 2) To give you confidence, poise and value with an added sense of adequacy with every piece of my creation. I want people to wear my creation with a justified amount of boldness and humility leaving behind a feeling of sharing and belonging.  So far, the people wearing my fashion label without knowing have contributed to celebrating with the African people, bringing dreams alive, creating jobs for the indigenous in west Africa and waking up the sleeping fashion industry in Africa. 
By us adding value and modernizing the ""toghu"" Many Cameroonian designers have been inspired on how to further exploit this rich culture hence creating more fashions and jobs. I need your help to change more lives, create more jobs and wake up the African fashion Industry. Your donations will not only make this possible but it will also be a part of creating history.  In just a few years we have been able to build a great following due to our ground breaking work, playing a big role in lots of shows around the world, creating a lot of interest and awareness on our brand.We received major recognition from media giants like the BBC and New African Woman. This attracted the attention Cameroon officials and we had our first major contract in 2010 to create special contemporary outfits for the Cameroonian delegation to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
 This phase was either the great beginning or the great end for our career in fashion. We plunged into the job determined to bring out the best for our nation so we could be fashionably represented at the world cup. This sweet dream turned sour when we realized our work went all in vain. Until this day, we did not receive up to ¼ of the payments though we supplied the goods and on time to our buyers.  Failure is inevitable when you are in the process of creating something big and worthwhile. We did not stop at the first major failure and we will not stop now. Like it is said, if you haven’t failed then you have not really tried. I will keep trying and that is why I need your help.  This was the turning point in my life - debts, loss of trust from our friends, deception, confusion, frustration. Many things came to an end. After all our hard work turned into failure, my first partnership business went bankrupt, ending the partnership and losing some fans and clients - The company that was built on young and vibrant inspirations that brought together thousands of young people around the world to dare, to be bold and face their future courageously especially in the creative world. However my partner and I chose to but as the beginning of a new and beautiful day. Instead of one, we now have two amazing fashion innovations thriving in two different parts of the world and we are both grateful for the tough times and proud of our new birth.  Today an even more amazing company is born – KibonenNY of which I am very proud.  Kibonen NY did not go far from the original concepts. The Toghu still stays primordial – Putting Cameroons own pride and culture on the high fashion scene, working with other African prints and luxurious textiles to create a fresh fusion of rich contemporary styles, fabrics and trends is all of what makes this brand truly unique.  Besides being a fashion lifestyle brand, KibonenǀNY is an ethical fashion brand. Cameroon is a country with abundant talent, unbelievable design aesthetics, amazing and beautiful people yet over 49% of the population live below the poverty line. This was another gripping factor that urged the formation of my brand - using the business of fashion to help create employment in Cameroon, paying employees a fair wage that will not only aid survival but allow them to improve their standard of living.  After realizing the potential that ethical fashion could provide.  KibonenNY together with some partners formed the Cameroon Fashion Common Initiative Group and instigated the start up of an ethical factory - “Made In Camer”, which today is an independent, charity based, eco and ethical clothing production unit that supports local talent and provides employment to Cameroonians in one of the poorest communities. Made in Camer aims to create a sustainable and creative long term solution to Cameroons economic crisis by putting forward community driven, ethical and environmentally friendly trade in fashion. The bigger aim for Made in Camer is to have many other local and international designers as well as other companies with specific production needs produce from Cameroon and distribute on an international level.
The great news for us today is that it is very possible.  KibonenNY has been selected to take part in the prestigious Mercedes Benz Fashion Week in South Africa. This is every fashion designers dream and one of my Dreams come True. This is a major visibility platform that comes with amazing opportunities
With all the excitement, I am kindly asking for your support to help make KibonenNY the revolution it seeks to be not just a piece of clothing to wear but an innovation that seeks to implement a substantial improvement in the lives of many whose voices have been drowned by the forces of nature, pressure and lack of proper resources. You will not only be wearing a beautiful piece of creation, you will be giving back to the world and making it a better place.
With your generous Donations, KibonenNY will be able to;
Execute the 2013 collection which will be showcased at the Mercedes Benz Fashion week in South Africa ,Flight and logistics to SA, Production of Items for sales at the Africa Fashion Week Trade Expo, Hire PR to take advantage of this exposure and enhance branding and marketing and an extensive media campaign,do a Lookbook, do a fashion video for promotion, an Ecommerce website and improve on the equipment at the Made In Camer Fair trade Production center in Bamenda and do an official Launch of KibonenNY brand in NYC.
Our total expense is really high but we will like to start with a minimum amount which can enable us kickstart.
Perks Perks Perks!!! What you receive with the pledge 
Huge amounts off the retail value of our Collections and fair trade items, not yet available in stores. Most importantly, you become part of our story of bringing high quality, well designed African-made clothing",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We all have lots of things going on in our lives. From business stuff to home decoration to sports. And it gets more every day.</p>
<p>Get a grip on it again! Enter your tasks in an easy to use App and see how things relate. It's like a powerful shopping list with a graphical twist. And it works wonders as our brains are wired for images, not for lists.</p>

<p>If you ever used a mindmapping tool, you already know the idea. Collect your thoughts as a simple tree that shows the relations between them. Mindmapping tools are great for this, but they stop exactly there. They don't remind you what to do.</p>
<p>With task managers it's the other way around. They remind you what to do, but they are usually organized as lists. That works well for 5-10 items. But the larger the list gets the more confusing it is.</p>
<p>Organize:Fab will bring the best of both worlds together: plan and structure like in a mindmapping or drawing App, and later on get all the benefits of a great task manager.</p>

<p>We are a small startup company located in Hamburg, Germany. All our team members have been project managers for different customer before we started taskfabric. We successfully managed projects for small companies up to large enterprises.</p>
<p>We started taskfabric in early 2012 because we couldn't find any product on the market that suited our own need to manage lots of tasks for private and company related projects. All the products we looked at simply limited us more and more after a while instead of helping us.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Phenomenal Woman the Movement (PWTM) is a company founded by two extraordinarily talented God-fearing women who act with integrity in all they do.

We will set-up and run our business as a clothing company, but this is also the beginning of a movement where we will seek to encourage and uplift women of all economic classes and age groups. Primarily, the profits from this company will be used to start other business ventures that will allow us to continue our mission of helping women within the United States and throughout the world. These ventures include motivational seminars, housing projects, health awareness programs, community service events, etc.... As mentioned PWTM will be legally operated as a clothing company, but will foster a revolution with the purpose of encouraging woman to feel good about themselves and their bodies.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>Q: Can I also use this for hiking or is it just a city bag?</p>
<p>A: </p>
<p>My colleague is 6ft and he took it with his Girlf on the hike up to Machu Picchu (they didn’t take the bus), by the end of the trip they were fighting on who gets to use it. I have personally taken it to climb Ometepe the smaller of the two volcanoes in Nicaragua it was an 8 hour hike. The sole of my timbos fell apart, I got attacked by giant ants, but the bag came through with flying colors.</p>
<p>As for the straps the good thing about it is you can change on the fly to a messenger. So if you get tired of carrying it on both shoulders you can switch to sling. If you feel the need for padded straps we will offer our backers at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the bag is an extra compartment for reflective rain cover. Sometimes when hiking the weather suddenly turns, or perhaps ,as a safety concern, you need people to see you when it gets dark. I don’t believe there is a more versatile but at the same time simple bag on the market. So no it's good for hiking, it's f*cking great for hiking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between Leather and the Vegetarian Lether?</p>
<p>A: </p>
<p>The trim and the square section on the right side. Both materials are durable. Some people prefer non leather for religious or other reasons. The vegetarian leather a.k.a. pleather looks similar to leather but feels different.</p>
<p>Most of us in the office prefer the luxury of soft leather but give you the option to decide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Is the bag water resistant?</p>
<p>A: For most of us this is our everyday carry &amp; we didn't want to use harsh chemicals. Instead of coating the bag, we designed a removable reflective rain cover in the bottom compartment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How do I order the bags?</p>
<p>A: The only way to get one is through our Indiegogo page here! People who back the project get to have their very own Använda bags earlier and save a bunch over the future retail prices ranging from $119-$159. Here is how it works: <br/>1. You have to pledge for a reward you want.<br/>2. To pledge for a rewards click the ""Back this project"" button on the right side of the project page. <br/>3. Select the rewards you want in return for your pledge. Select the country you want it shipped to and finish the pledge. That’s it! <br/>4. We will send you a survey after approx. 2 weeks for your size, color and trim options for the Använda bags. <br/>5. You will then wait till for the bags to be shipped to you. =)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What are the dimensions and weight of the bag and wallet?</p>
<p>A: Anvanda Large <br/>H50cm = 19.7in <br/>W35cm = 13.8in</p>
<p>Weight is:</p>
<p>1 kg = 2.2 Lbs. Large: 1.2 kg = 2.6 Lbs. </p>
<p>Anvanda <br/>H40cm = 15.7in <br/>W30cm = 11.8in</p>
<p>Wallet:</p>
<p>6.6cm x10.1cm x 2.2 cm weighs 2.4 ounces <br/>2.6x4x.8 inches weighs 70 grams.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Can use it as a camera bag?</p>
<p>A: </p>
<p>Yes you sure can. Take the anvanda bag put a camera in it and BAM! - you have a great f*cking camera bag. If only it were that easy. We are some picture loving, backpack wearing, urban travel fanatics. The last thing we want to do is mess up our awesome dslr by not having the right gear.</p>
<p>At the end of the campaign we will give our backers the option of purchasing an anvanda waterproof/shockproof camera bag insert for dslr and slr cameras, you know so you don't f*ck your camera up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Can I change my pledge to real leather?</p>
<p>A: At the end of the campaign we will send out a survey so you can pick whichever add-ons you would like to receive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Noce bag but it would be even better with a sternumm/ cross strap.</p>
<p>A: Ok technically this is not a question but really?</p>
<p>""Nice bag""?</p>
<p>We don't make nice, we make f*cking great.</p>
<p>So you're one of those bike messengers, motorcyclist, or perhaps even a skateboarder? Reflective rain cover not enough for you, now you want sternum straps!?</p>
<p>Damn right we have a cross strap, <br/>The strap snaps into the bottom hooks if you need uber stability. These will be available to our backers after the campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I am vegan, are you vegan?</p>
<p>A: Well, schucks. If you mean ""you"" as in me writing this. No I am not vegan, my colleague is though, which is what lead to us making a vegan version of the bag. ☮</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I want a fucking awesome wallet, can I add it to my pledge?</p>
<p>A: yes, we already have this option. If you are buying more than 2 bags we intend on offering the wallet after the campaign is over, and promise to do our best efforts to have it's price offered to our backers to be as similar as possible to the Indiegogo price.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How do I specify my address?</p>
<p>A: We'll be reaching out to all our backers after the campaign ends to collect shipping address in a survey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How stain resistance is the bag?</p>
<p>A: I accidentally marked up my bag a few weeks ago, i was f*cking devastated. They only gave me one company issued bag, so you can imagine how i was feeling.</p>
<p>I left it on the sofa a few days and then went to the sink and took so soap and water…walla! It came out. With mild soap and water you will be fine.</p>
<p>For bag ♥'ers: <br/>If you get the leather version , which I have, Dampen a lint-free cloth with cool water and wipe clean. Start from the top and wipe -- do not rub -- while moving downward. Refrain from saturating it; let everything air-dry. Buff with a lint-free cloth dampened with leather cleaner and conditioner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I want a large quantity of bags, can you provide us with any discounts?</p>
<p>A: Of course we will! Just shoot us a message with the following details and we will get back to you on our discounted pricing and details on how to pledge. <br/>1. What style of bags do you want to order ? <br/>2. How many orders in EACH style ? <br/>3. Will they all be shipped to the same address ?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I want to gift the bag, how do I do so?</p>
<p>A: Its simple, order one of our bags and in the survey (sent out at the end of the campaign) mark it as a gift and we will gift wrap it for you for free!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Will the bag be available in additional colors?</p>
<p>A: We are still evaluating adding more colors, if we do decide we will let our backers know.</p>

<p>The HICKIES Lacing System is a modular one, meaning instead of one lace running through the length of each shoe, you have one strap per pair of eyelets. This gives you maximum control when it comes to customizing tightness, comfort, and style. Experiment to find your perfect fit.<br/></p>

</div></div>","A Better Footwear Experience:
We've found this generally comes down to 3 things. How do your shoes fit? How do they look? How do you put them on everyday?  
The HICKIES Lacing System is an upgrade from traditional laces, those old-world strings. It improves the Fit, Aesthetics, and Usability of wearing shoes for everyone. It's a new era of laces, designed to keep you moving. So no matter how you run, walk, dance or play through your day, you can do it more freely, more comfortably, and more beautifully.








The HICKIES Lacing System is a simple design made with smart materials. There are no bows to tie, no loose laces, and no holding you back. It at once makes your shoes more comfortable, adjustable, adaptive, and sleek. Fasten only once, slip on and off every time. Very convenient.







The HICKIES Lacing System is a modular one, meaning instead of one lace running through the length of each shoe, you have one strap per pair of eyelets. This gives you maximum control when it comes to customizing tightness, comfort, and style. Experiment to find your perfect fit.











The modular, no-tie technology behind HICKIES laces is what makes it a universal product that provides dynamic benefits for all.






















When the campaign ends, we will send you an email so you can choose your packs and colors :)




















Our team comes from all corners of the globe—Argentina, Israel, Venezuela, Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Canada, Taiwan, Korea, and the United States—so there was no better place to call home than the cultural melting pot that is New York City.

    Whether on business or holiday, looking sharp when you travel often leads to a more elevated experience. From fine restaurants to meeting new people, dressing well opens more doors to attractive possibilities.And who doesn’t hope for unexpected adventures when they are away from home? It’s why we travel.  But, nice and stylish clothes can't handle the rigors of travel. They get damaged easily, wrinkle and collect odors. The alternative isn't great either. Clothes that are built for travel make you look like you're hunting big game in the middle of London.   I’m Kyle and 11 years ago I decided to make some massive life changes. So, I started to travel the world to find a new way to work and live.Making the investment in myself has paid off and I’ve transitioned from wandering-corporate-refugee-backpacker to globetrotting entrepreneur with a mission. Early in this journey, I realized that my appearance had a huge impact on my experiences. When I retired my polyester shirts and cargo pockets, everything changed for the better.But, it was dressing well that highlighted the problem. There wasn’t anything on the market that looked great and traveled well. I had to pack more clothes and do more laundry just to look presentable.That experience led to what is now Libertad: Upscale Style + High PerformanceProfessional to personal; day to night; hot to cold; wet to dry. What you have in your carry on must manage it all. Travelers pack a lot into a day. So, Libertad's #1 goal is for you to look great no matter what you're doing. Staying true to classic design, the color and cut were chosen so you won’t look underdressed at meetings, or like you just came from the office when going out at the end of the day. Coat or no coat; tucked in or out; you can be prepared for anything without packing a lot of shirts for each occasion.   Changing environmental conditions are unavoidable when you're on the move. Taxis, airports, planes and hotels...travelers make these transitions frequently and rapidly. Add the weather outside and your body is taking a beating. Libertad's proprietary fabric has superior moisture management and built in thermal regulation. So, whether you are at sea level or 35,000 feet, our shirts fight to keep you dry and comfortable without getting clammy or collecting odor.  Merino wool: the all-natural, high-performance fiber.This isn’t the heavy, hot and rough wool of the past. Libertad has created a proprietary, lightweight fabric that is soft enough to wear next to the skin and light enough to be worn all year round.  Advancements in wool technology allow us to spin and weave the Merino into a much finer fabric no longer limiting its use to blankets and heavy flannel shirts.      By combining our lightweight material with the natural breathability and temperature regulation of Merino, it can be worn comfortably all year round.Add odor & wrinkle resistance and you have a shirt perfect for travel anywhere at any time, day after day.  Other natural capabilities of Merino perfect for travel:
UV protection 
anti-static 
durable
stain resistant
flame retardant 
colorfast 
   Impressed with Merino? It's not done...It's also eco-friendly and sustainable.Merino has a smaller environmental impact that helps preserve the world we love to travel.
Biodegradable. It breaks down and returns to the soil. 
Renewable. Not only does the wool grow back each year, but the food for sheep, grass, is also renewable and sustainable under the best land management practices.

Therefore, Evea considers of great importance the strengthening of communities and the enhancement of forests with products of biodiversity, through strategic fencing. When a rubber tapper has incomes from the extraction of the latex from shiringa in his space, he has an incentive to go through all the forest where his shiringa trees are found and in consequence he patrols the area, protecting it from any illegal logger.

I had heard the subject before, but it was very shocking to live and see it. It is so from that moment I decided to do everything possible to change that situation. In parallel Jorge sought to develop accessories with sustainable materials. Celeste reflected on how to integrate greater value in her fashion designs.

Help us to protect the planet! You can also preserve the forests from anywhere in the world  How is the forest preserved with an Evea shoe or accessory?The Amazon region is one of the most beautiful and biodiverse areas in the world, but the main problem is Deforestation. In Peru, 120,000 hectares of forest are deforested annually due to disorganized agriculture, logging and illegal mining that unbalance the ecosystem.Faced with this great challenge, we have seen a SOLUTION that allows generating spaces for the protection of forests in a proactive way, generating income in the communities and encouraging the care of trees: The Natural Latex of Shiringa (Wild Natural Rubber) THE SHIRINGA:The hope of the Amazon ForestThe shiringa tree (wild natural rubber) grows in the Amazon and has a milky liquid called latex, which is extracted through a sustainable and artisanal process. An incision is made in the bark, taking care not to damage the tree. Then the latex is stored in trays to be later converted into sheets of dry rubber.

This is how the ""Strategic Conservation Fence"" is formed. FUNDS THAT WE NEED We want to invite you to be part of this impact and for that we are looking to raise $ 6000 which would be used in the following way:1) Adjustment of 5 Molds of women's sizes (From 36 to 40)2) Development of a Mold for women (35)3) Development of 5 Sizes for men (From 42 to 46)4) Working capital for the development of footwear.

One virus changed everything. Lives are being lost, families are forever changed. Flights all over the world are halted, borders are closed, and entire economies have been shut down. Each and every life on this planet has been affected.Who’s to Blame? Who knows….. WHO knowsMany people complain about being in lockdown - not being able to go to work, to the gym, to the pub or the club or to do whatever they want to do. But we have a different view. Thanks to these lockdowns, we all gain something that is priceless: TIMETIME to try a new recipe and enjoy it with your family.TIME to fix all those little things at home you have been promising to do for months, if not years….TIME to understand your kids who you never realised grew up so fast and were drifting away from you because neither of you had time for each other.TIME to catch up on with your old parents whom live miles away and you are always too busy to meet or call.TIME to water all those dying plants in your garden.No matter how different we are, we are all equal, regardless of our culture, religion, occupation, financial situation or whether we are famous or not.The disease treats us all equally, and perhaps we should now treat each other that way too.CLARO watchmakers are pleased to introduce PR.C: POWER OF RESILIENCE. CLARO, a unique wristwatch that serves as a testament to human ingenuity and a wearable reminder of the challenges and sacrifices of the Covid-19 era. “As a boutique watch manufacturer, we saw countless clients, friends and competitors shut down or suspend operations almost overnight in the face of the coronavirus,” said George J. Von Burg III, Group Managing Director of CLARO. “We didn’t want to just give up and close our doors. We decided early on to view this situation as an opportunity. We wanted to use the talent and know-how we’d spent years developing to create something new: a watch design that honors this specific moment in time.”The DesignThe PR.C’s unique design is the product of a three-month marathon of brainstorming and teamwork.Its half-dome dial evokes the ubiquitous face masks worn by billions around the world to counter the spread of the virus.

Say goodbye to wires. Say hello to true connectivity. With lightning-fast Bluetooth 5 technology, a certified IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, 32 hour battery life, these truly wireless, auto-pairing earbuds are exactly what you’ve been waiting for.Aria was developed after extensive research to meet the needs of the most discerning listener. With a host of premium features like all-day battery life, total waterproofing, noise cancellation and smart assistant compatibility (just to name a few), these earbuds are ready to take your listening to the next level.  

 
 


Our team has spent thousands of hours and tested nearly 100 different drivers with the best audio engineers available to push the boundaries of audio technology to create ARIA.Superior technology means superior sound: Experience ARIA’s top-shelf sound quality and bask in its incredibly powerful bass, crisp mid-highs, and crystal clear vocals, and have your own personal bubble that encompasses you in premium acoustics.   Who says you can't play all day? With 32-hour battery life that allows up to 8 hours of initial play time and an additional 24 hours from the handy charging case, you can keep your playlist on repeat without breaking a sweat.Our award winning designers and R&D team designed ARIA to have the best battery life on the market - beating even much more expensive headphones currently on the market.  ARIA features the latest and greatest in Bluetooth technology. With Bluetooth 5, you get the strongest and most reliable connection yet for consistently seamless connectivity between your devices. Strongest connections and speeds means more capacity for data transfer, which means more incredibly detailed and robust sound dimensions and zero audio-video lag, only possible with this cutting edge Bluetooth technology.Beyond speed and strength of connectivity, did you know that hackers can hack your phone through older Bluetooth 4.1 and 4.2 in less than 10 seconds? Bluetooth 5.0 achieves unparalleled, military-grade security to keep your personal information secure.  Our ergonomic design tested against a variety of ears ensures that everyone can have unhindered access to superior sound.We’ve spent months collecting data on thousands of ears across all 6 continents to create the perfect combination of ARIA’s proprietary form factor, ear tips, and wings. While ears are unique like fingerprints, our analysis found the ergonomically optimal tilt, angle, and contact points to securely, but comfortably, place the wing to maximize comfort, sound seal, and distance to eardrum. ARIA can achieve a comfortable and secure seal in every ear with its unique system combining the use of both earbud tips and wing tips.  Being truly wireless means ARIA never gets in your way, but helps you get to where you want to be. We developed ARIA to have strong and secure connectivity to your device with a working distance of 35 ft, so you never drop a call, lose connection, or miss a moment when you have ARIA.After meticulous engineering, countless prototypes, and relentless testing on the world's most discerning ears, the result is better sound quality whether your device is in your pocket, your hand, or on the bench while you're on the court.ARIA sets you free - roam around the house, play your hardest on the field, even take a dip - ARIA never stops you from doing your thing. Tested for for thousands of hours in dozens of different settings, ARIA uses a custom made LDS antenna to increase bandwidth and signal reception while reducing interference and noise. Our magnetic secure-fit technology guarantees your earbuds never get lost or fall out of place.This design optimizes for battery capacity and compactness by removing the need for unnecessary buttons or mechanics and helps you achieve a perfect fit every time. No buttons, no springs, no mess.    Ever have lag issues with your Bluetooth speakers or earbuds? Nearly all true wireless earbuds out there - by Bose, Jabra, and Beats sure has.After relentless research and a commitment to the best sound quality technology can provide, we managed to remove virtually all sound lag between your device and our buds. Never miss a beat and experience videos exactly as they were meant to be.  We use a proprietary silicone material paired with our extensive ergonomic tests to ensure ARIA provides the right contour for every ear while creating a impeccable seal for outside noise cancellation. The result is your own sound studio, wherever you need it. ARIA outperforms other major brands by overcoming a common limitation in wireless audio tech: the stereo call. With ARIA, you can take your phone calls and listen through both earbud pieces so that you can literally be all ears.   We are proud of ARIA because we believe we’ve truly made something better than what’s out there. We’re a team of engineers and audiophiles with a passion for creating amazing products that bring the best possible listening experience to every pair of ears. When designing ARIA, we tested more than 200 different permutations of earbud design, charging case circuitry and composition, and Bluetooth chip choice to bring you what we believe are the best earbuds available.Unlike other crowdfunding campaigns, we've already spent months developing a manufacturing-ready model and only need funding for the initial batch order.

In fact, before the AirPods came out,  we'd already been selling our waterproof wireless earbuds. Since then, we've sold thousands of units across 29 countries.",106.0,0,"1 Campaign

Something that embodied the same beauty yet was flexible, resilient and soft enough to be handmade into accessories.</span><br/></p><p>  I wanted to use it in a new and interesting way, as a flexible fabric not a hard panel material. After lots of research and experimentation I eventually figured out different processes to modify it into a softer and more resilient luxury fabric compared to the stiff material it was traditionally being made into. Earlier this year I began working with an awesome designer in NYC to make initial designs: something sleek, luxurious, modern and one of a kind.</p><p> <b>But Why Carbon Fiber? </b>Carbon Fiber is an exotic high tech material, used in sports cars and fighter jets, it has amazing tensile strength and beautiful patterns. It is is composed of a microscopic crystalline structure of carbon. Most kinds are stronger than steel in tensile strength and lighter than aluminum. The strongest carbon fiber in the world is up to five times stronger than steel when used in special applications.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439911627/jfn5xgiljstuilts1o1a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>How are we using it?</b> In collaboration with excellent material engineers we started with a raw carbon fiber weave and developed custom coatings that would make it flexible and drape-able. It is water proof, highly resilient and beautiful. This is beyond a doubt a new era in luxury high tech materials and the beginning of the road to many endless possibilities. </p><h4><b>The Designs</b></h4><p>The wallets are made of a soft coat flexible carbon fiber with an attractive semigloss or matte finish and genuine leather accents. The deep black gloss and graphite like reflections come from the natural color of the carbon fiber weave.</p><h4><b>1. Lightweight Carbon Fiber Clip (Black)</b></h4><div>

<p>Most new credit cards have RFID (radio frequency identity) chips embedded to allow you to put your card over a reader to complete a transaction without having to swipe it. Unfortunately, this makes it a possibility for identity theft using handheld card scanners to gather your financial information off your card remotely. We've employed a double layer Ni-Co Radio Frequency Shielding Conductive Fabric inside the lining of the pockets to help block the ability of hackers to remotely steal the information on the new generation of credit cards and personal IDs.</p>

<a href=""http://www.darkgryphon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Visit Our Official Website</a></div>","If you missed our campaign connect with us at DarkGryphon.com The story of how it started - Super Cars and Carbon Fiber An enthusiast of super cars and high tech materials, I thought to myself wouldn't it be amazing if there were luxury wallets being made of the same carbon fiber used in super-cars that makes them ultra light and strong? Something that embodied the same beauty yet was flexible, resilient and soft enough to be handmade into accessories.  I wanted to use it in a new and interesting way, as a flexible fabric not a hard panel material. After lots of research and experimentation I eventually figured out different processes to modify it into a softer and more resilient luxury fabric compared to the stiff material it was traditionally being made into. Earlier this year I began working with an awesome designer in NYC to make initial designs: something sleek, luxurious, modern and one of a kind. But Why Carbon Fiber? Carbon Fiber is an exotic high tech material, used in sports cars and fighter jets, it has amazing tensile strength and beautiful patterns. It is is composed of a microscopic crystalline structure of carbon. Most kinds are stronger than steel in tensile strength and lighter than aluminum. The strongest carbon fiber in the world is up to five times stronger than steel when used in special applications.  How are we using it? In collaboration with excellent material engineers we started with a raw carbon fiber weave and developed custom coatings that would make it flexible and drape-able. It is water proof, highly resilient and beautiful. This is beyond a doubt a new era in luxury high tech materials and the beginning of the road to many endless possibilities. The DesignsThe wallets are made of a soft coat flexible carbon fiber with an attractive semigloss or matte finish and genuine leather accents. The deep black gloss and graphite like reflections come from the natural color of the carbon fiber weave.1. Lightweight Carbon Fiber Clip (Black)

                         or Carbon Fiber-Kevlar Hybrid Colored Clips





2. Textured Carbon Fiber Wallet (Black) ""With RFID Shielding 2.0"" - Bifold (Slim)


Most new credit cards have RFID (radio frequency identity) chips embedded to allow you to put your card over a reader to complete a transaction without having to swipe it. Unfortunately, this makes it a possibility for identity theft using handheld card scanners to gather your financial information off your card remotely. We've employed a double layer Ni-Co Radio Frequency Shielding Conductive Fabric inside the lining of the pockets to help block the ability of hackers to remotely steal the information on the new generation of credit cards and personal IDs.



The exterior has a special coating with a uniquely textured feel. You can actually feel the ridges in the carbon fiber weave when you run your fingers over it.

As a thank-you to everyone who contributes to this campaign, we provide pairs of our sunglasses at prices lower than what we normally charge. *This model does not float since the lenses are not completely surrounded by the frame. In the photos, Gabriela and Andre, sharing good moments with their zen spontaneous mood.In the photo above, some of our ambassadors who already wear Joplins and support us.  Our designs embody the vibe our brand wants to emanate: cool, light, good vibes while also connected with purpose and simplicity. We have been praised for simplicity and smoothness in everything we are doing. We are also making sure to give attention to details regarding quality so that we continue to offer a world-class product.Bamboo is 100% sustainable when cut past the first node, it continues to grow normally. It is cost efficient, requires no irrigation, rarely needs replanting, it grows rapidly, can be harvested in 3-5 years,  grows in a wide range of environments and it produces 35% more oxygen than an equivalent stand of trees. In addition, bamboo is biodegradable. Including double flexed hinges, it will make your sunglasses stronger, harder to break the frames because of it's flexibility and also, offer a better fit to your head. Whatever your head size is, we have a pair of sunglasses for you.Bamboo is very resistant and is nowadays used in many ways as house construction, bicycles, roads and bridges, furniture etc. It is also resistant to humidity, so you can put it in the water as many times as you want :) Joplins Shades float! If you'd like to go stand up paddle boarding, wakeboarding, or even surfing, you can count on Joplins to be floating right next to you in case you take a fall. :) The bamboo is very lighter than aluminum, acetate, wood, and polycarbonate. It is very comfortable, so you almost don't feel it on your face. We guarantee it will fit smoothly on your face and especially above your nose.All of our sunglasses are handmade and each of them has a special touch. Therefore, your sunglasses will never be quite like any other pair. All Joplins models come with the top lenses POLAROID 1.1 mm TAC with 100% UV400 protection reducing eye fatigue and shock absorbing. Besides that, all the lenses are POLARIZED, offering a glare-free vision, maximum sight comfort and a clear contrast, very special for days sunbathing at the beach, cycling, skiing or driving a car.  Founded in California, Joplins went directly to Rio de Janeiro, where it reflects the warm, tropical climate and the upbeat vibes of samba and then Lisbon, where the team has just begun operations. We think that these 3 locations would give us the synergy we need to help develop our idea, followed by the sun, lots of beaches, good energy and nature. We are still in very early stage with only a few pieces in the market and we would like to raise funds to help us increase our productivity, then gaining scale and be able to consolidate what we have given birth.Beyond making a monetary contribution, you can help us by sharing this campaign with all your friends and family.

The good news is the moulds only have to be made once.  Children's Pakems will be great for the end of the ski day when ski boots are very heavy for the little ones.  They are also great for fitting in a child's backpack on inclement weather school days.  We already have orders for kids shoes but can't fulfill the orders without your help.  Our hope is IndieGoGo fans will back this campaign to help us raise the $40k needed to complete the molds and buy the materials.  </span></p>

<div>Over the last 20 years, fine crafted footwear has slowly slipped away from the USA, but Malvin + Joyce footwear is dedicated to change the way Americans buy their products. </div>
<div>
<p>With over 15 years in the apparel &amp; footwear industries, we have learned a great deal.  Over the last 5 years, we have reconnected to our deep roots of manufacturing footwear in the USA.  After being layed off in late 2008 and seeing Americans loosing jobs at an alarming rate, the reality hit hard that the U.S. and world economy was much worse than the media was portraying.  Even worse an overwhelming majority of American manufacturing businesses dating back to 20+ years were forced to shut their doors for good because o overseas competition.  A very small few remained.  We began to research the few that remained and an idea began to form which would take four years to come to realization.  The idea came to craft fine quality American-made men's workboots inspired by American Heritage.  Footwear that was designed, manufactured, sourced and machined 100% made in the USA.</p>
<p>Malvin + Joyce has struggled to launch the brand, but even with numerous delays we continued to remain unerringly committed to our American-made collection.  Never overlooking our committment to quality men's footwear.</p>
<p>Malvin + Joyce is now finally ready for the general public because of every last person who has worked with us to realize this dream and made this collection possible.</p>
<p>When we originally set out to source all the materials for Malvin + Joyce we vowed to only use the finest materials in the world. After waiting and then testing the materials we ordered from all over the world, we realized that the need to source in the US not only seemed to make the most sense, it was also deemed to be the most difficult and expensive at times.</p>
<p>As the economy grew more dire and many more of the USA supply chain manufacturers started to close up shop around the US it was our goal to do what little we could to help keep these manufacturers in business or at least remain more optimistic.</p>
<p>Our commitment to ONLY sourcing domestically from the leather we use down to sewing thread, we feel it is important to not only support other USA businesses, but to show other businesses that using an American supply chain is possible if you make an honest effort to find the suppliers they need.</p>
It is our continued commitment to always use US companies in building our American brand and we hope you share our commitment when you consider buying our American-made products.</div>
<h2><strong>WHY DO YOU NEED FUNDING</strong></h2>
<p>Up until this point, we have completely self-funded the launch of our American-made brand.  We have succesffully designed and sourced Malvin + Joyce, finalizing the collection and manufacturing.  </p>
<p>We are now ready for our first-run production, which will cost $20,000, the bare bones required to begin production.  We are now asking you to join us and help the process of bringing footwear manufacturing and jobs back to the USA. </p>
<p>The cost includes the cost to create molds, minimum order quantities, packaging, shipping and insurance.  We are hoping to raise at least $10,000 here BUT that's just the beginning.</p>
<p>Once we reach $20,000, any additional funding allows us to build our website, tell the story of the everyday Americans who inspired the Malvin + Joyce brand and to continue our mission of creating fine quality American-made &amp; Inspired products ultimately putting Americans back to work.</p>

THE IMPACT

The the craft of shoemaking is experiencing something of a renaissance. Over the last few years, as heritage brands have been rediscovered by a new generation of customers, especially young men, labels once seen as relics of American work wear now have an unexpected cool factor, stocked by stylish boutiques and obsessed about on fashion blogs.
That change has helped draw younger people into shoemaking and a new generation of young people are being trained to a job that had almost become extinct in the USA.  The fact we have a much younger shoemaking work force than we did 15 years ago is evidence there is more appeal to this work.

There is an obstacle right now for independent designers everywhere.  Independent designers must do everything themselves, from designing the footwear, producing the footwear and then selling the footwear.
We must rely on the fading cottage industry or do everything ourselves. Not only will Malvin + Joyce strengthen the community by creating jobs, but will continue the education of a dying art and help expand Chicago into a center of forward thinking in fashion and style.

<p><strong>Refund Policy</strong></p>
<p>What is your refund policy?</p>
<p><u>Indiegogo's refund policy states:</u></p>
<p>""For campaign backers: Backers can process a refund for their transaction made to a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, provided a campaign is live and not ended, the perk claimed has not been fulfilled, and the funds have not been disbursed to the campaigner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risk &amp; Challenges </strong></p>
<p>This is not the first start-up we’ve made. Which is why we know which part of the process that is vital for a successful launch.</p>
<p>In the last year, we’ve assembled a strong supply chain, from the materials suppliers to manufacturers to quality control to shipping and fulfillment partners, so we’re confident that we can deliver high-quality footwear to you in time.</p>
<p>Once our campaign is funded, we are ready to head straight to full production mode. Our material supplier and factory partner are on stand by and waiting for the go signal. As the shoes go into production, we will personally travel to Spain for overseeing the production to make sure that we don’t run into any issues.</p>
<p>As with any product, unforeseen delays can happen. We’ve intentionally padded our schedule to accommodate these changes. We promise to keep our backers updated throughout the process and let you know if we foresee any updates to the delivery timeline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ethical Manufacturing</strong></p>
<p>As part of our selection process, we ensure that the partners we chose have strong ethical practices as it relates to their workforce. We walk around the factory to make sure that the conditions are safe and sanitary. We specifically look for family-run factories that focus on higher-end skilled labour because we consider them our trusted manufacturing partners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Quality Control</strong></p>
<p>In order to ensure that the final product that gets shipped out to our customers is up to standard, we work with a third-party quality control company. The firm is run by our agent, based locally near the factory, so we always have a set of eyes and ears on the ground. </p>

Refund Policy
What is your refund policy?
Indiegogo's refund policy states:
""For campaign backers: Backers can process a refund for their transaction made to a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, provided a campaign is live and not ended, the perk claimed has not been fulfilled, and the funds have not been disbursed to the campaigner.
 
Risk & Challenges 
This is not the first start-up we’ve made. Which is why we know which part of the process that is vital for a successful launch.
In the last year, we’ve assembled a strong supply chain, from the materials suppliers to manufacturers to quality control to shipping and fulfillment partners, so we’re confident that we can deliver high-quality footwear to you in time.
Once our campaign is funded, we are ready to head straight to full production mode. Our material supplier and factory partner are on stand by and waiting for the go signal. As the shoes go into production, we will personally travel to Spain for overseeing the production to make sure that we don’t run into any issues.
As with any product, unforeseen delays can happen. We’ve intentionally padded our schedule to accommodate these changes. We promise to keep our backers updated throughout the process and let you know if we foresee any updates to the delivery timeline.
 
Ethical Manufacturing
As part of our selection process, we ensure that the partners we chose have strong ethical practices as it relates to their workforce. We walk around the factory to make sure that the conditions are safe and sanitary. We specifically look for family-run factories that focus on higher-end skilled labour because we consider them our trusted manufacturing partners.
 
Quality Control
In order to ensure that the final product that gets shipped out to our customers is up to standard, we work with a third-party quality control company. The firm is run by our agent, based locally near the factory, so we always have a set of eyes and ears on the ground.

We are now focusing on YOU and your look, using a fresh design.When we decided to perfect the business model for our luxury glasses, we realized that we needed to rethink three important aspects: design, quality and distribution. We are determined not only to improve the quality of the product and the distribution network but also its design, making sure your Lance Glasses become your essential fashion accessory. Reduce the glare and see clearer with our Sharp Lenses or choose the Fade Lenses that automatically darken when you go outside.Fade® Lenses - Eyeglasses and sunglasses, instantly in the same pair. Quick change. Fade lenses are clear indoors and darker to 70% in bright sunlight. A nice and welcome upgrade for your eyes. Our transition technology called Fade® Lenses, enables you to have more pairs of glasses in one perfect pair.Sharp® Lenses - You can choose between the view lenses with blue light protection and sunglasses lenses.  Do you want to keep it simple? We thought of you and without making any compromises! Keeping all the functions of our lenses, we created Sharp® Lenses, giving you the possibility to choose between our plain lenses and sunglasses lenses.The Sharp® Lenses are the most evolved digital life lenses. The nanotechnology coatings are acting as a shield against blue light from your daily exposure to screens. The main source of HEV light in our lives is the harmful blue-violet light emitted by our digital screens. From TVs to tablets, computers to phones, we’re constantly exposing ourselves to the unnatural blue light. Having Sharp Lenses on your Lance Glasses will limit the amount of blue light that enters your eyes, making your screen time more pleasant.Each pair is made of first-rate materials. We believe that quality isn’t optional or just too expensive. High-quality metal or Italian acetate obtained from hardened cotton flocks compose our frames in order to create an exquisite final product. Their weight and smart bridge will make you forget that you’re even wearing glasses.Your opinion matters to us and we are always interested in hearing your thoughts and experience feedback. For that reason we are aware of your issues and suggestions and built the most stylish and smart eyewear pairs in the world!Acetate prototypes, matte and glossy black. The final product will not have transparent areas on the temples - this is a prototype stage section in order for you to see the technology used inside.We believe that the glasses are an extension of your body, not a bothering issue. They should complete your style and we want to play an active role in this process and help you create the desired image.Our designs are unique and specially created for you based on face anatomy research and current trends so that you can look and feel perfect all the time.The story of our design started in Morez (Jura Valley) considered the Silicon Valley of glasses, moved to Lille, France – Euratechnologies (Startups Incubator), Lance was founded to set your mind free from the endless search for overpriced glasses and help you focus on the things that really matter! We’ve teamed up with world class designers and high-tech manufacturers to craft above standard, strong, lightweight frames with high standard lenses, at a price that you’ll definitely find interesting. We have succeeded in combining modern Parisian designs inspired by current trends with French culture and tradition. It has al begun in 1796 in Les Arcets, a hamlet in Morez where Pierre-Hyacinthe Caseaux, an ingenious craftsman, had the idea of stretching and twisting a nail to make spectacles.While we manufacture our frames to the highest standard of quality.If you feel that the frame did not meet your expectations, simply contact us and we will replace the frame. Does that sound fair? :-) Then you should hurry up and reserve your eyewear. During the first campaign, many people asked us about our process. We do everything in the house and we want to make sunglasses and eyeglasses that do not weigh you down. That's why we started this in the first place. Our process begins with mood boards, shapes, colours, research and story made by our product developer and art director, Liviu. Our designer, Luc, creates the first sketches and drawings and the process continues with our engineer, Karim and our production manager, Gonzague, that manage the entire production from searching suppliers, making prototypes, quality checks and production planning to sending the glasses to their new owners.Once the campaign ends, you will be able to try the new virtual mirror that now works also from your smartphone so you can be sure that you’re make the best choice! Finding the right frame style for your face shape might feel tricky, but thankfully our app helps you pick the right frame and it is so easy.We want to offer you the possibility to match your frames to your style and the occasions you enjoy so we designed quality frames at a fair price. We’re not just for show. We strongly believe that a good design isn’t only about looking good. Seeing good is also a must. Lance enables you to have the best option without stressful research on lenses coatings. Our team, along with the best opticians, have selected and implemented the best for you.  Using the most advanced optical software and industry-leading machinery, Lance can handle the most complicated corections with an extraordinary level of accuracy and optical clarity, including digital free-form lenses. All of our lenses are maximum UV-protection and provide a 100% filter from harmful UVA, UVB and UVC rays including the blue light from digital screens. The invisible coatings make your glasses your best daily ally adapting to any situation. At the end of each month, we will send you a survey so you can choose your favourite model, colour and whether you need prescription lenses or not.We remove all the intermediaries and offer luxury glasses, three times cheaper than the store pricing. Our engineer and co-founder, Karim Bousbaine, has optimized and simplified processes and the management for the largest multinationals all over the world. He has used the experience gained in the last 15 years in the Lance Glasses fabrication process and so we have made this price possible, enabling us to offer you Luxury Limited Edition eyeglasses for less than 100€. Check some of the feedback that our previous happy customers shared on our site.Over the past year, we have developed our new Lance collection, improving and testing multiple prototypes until reaching perfection.

The collection we will launch with your help. Some are old favorites, tweaked and improved, the rest are new ones based on backers' suggestions. We've been working on this collection for a few months now, testing and refining them as we go along.  As a summary, this project features :  
Alpha series - briefcase in 13 & 15 size.
C.O. series - laptop bag in 15 size.
F.C. series - messenger bag in 10, 13 & 15 size.
Slim F.C. - slimmer version of the F.C. in 13 & 15 size.
Denim F.C. - the F.C. design in handwoven denim, in 13 & 15 size.
Fabric F.C. - the F.C. design in durable Sunbrella fabric, in 13 & 15 size.
The leather bags come in 2 colors, Dark & Brown, while the non leather bag will be finished with Dark leather. 
The number after the bag's name : 15 means it can fit a 15"" laptop, 13 a 13"" laptop and 10 a 9.7"" iPad or similar sized tablet. 
Slim F.C. 15/BrownOne of the general features of our bags is being able to be mounted  on a suitcase (except for the F.C. 10). You will be able to do this either by using the handles (C.O. series), the grab handle (F.C. series) or by using a bonus leather strap we'll include for the Alpha series. All bags except the F.C. 10 can be mounted on a suitcase.

Basically the color will be solid Black, no lighter/darker spots like the Dark & Brown seen on the photos in this project page. Handwoven DenimWe will be using one of the denim fabric produced by Lumintu.  Like us, their production is based in Indonesia. They are a small company based in Pekalongan, Indonesia, producing beautiful denim using time honored traditional techniques that you can see here. The Indonesian denim scene is very vibrant and we're very excited to be able to do this collaboration. The denim outer, Sunbrella lining and the leather details in the Denim F.C. series work really well together and we hope you'll agree. :)Denim F.C. 13 SunbrellaWe have been using Sunbrella to line our bags and for the bonus pouch for some time now and it has been very well received. It is made from acrylic and is extremely durable with great water repellent properties. The lining we choose has a base red color with black stripes. It's quite a striking color but not overwhelmingly so. We think it adds a bit more personality to the collection. Note : depending on your screen, the images might not display the small black stripes, but they're there.Fabric F.C. 15 Solid Brass Accessories Another suppliers we've worked together for quite some time. The solid brass accessories are handmade by Sotta Art of Jogjakarta, Indonesia, while the rivets are sourced from Buckleguy from the US. They are awesome people to work with and deliver high quality goods.All leather goods will be made in house in our own workshop in Jakarta, Indonesia. With successful crowdfunding projects on our belt plus a few experiences handling large volume B2B orders, our team is prepared to craft your rewards.Our timeline is as follows :
July - conclusion of our Kickstarter campaign and start of supplier delivery
August - final supplier delivery, continue production.
September - continue production.
October - goods inspection, packing. First batch of shipping begins.
C.O. 15/DarkThe Team :
Yoki P. Baskara - Designer, product developer and the guy who will communicate with  you throughout this project.

Risks and challenges
Given that we produce the goods in house. The biggest challenge is getting the materials on time.
Supplies, Leather :
Fortunately we are on great terms with him and we can put the order in advance. 
Color accuracy : Displaying accurate colors on all possible screens is very hard. That being said we've tried our best to make sure the photos properly represent the actual leather's colors.

<br/></div>","Pride rides deep in the Caldwell family!  We did not wear the hottest sneakers or the
latest fashions, that didn’t matter. We
were taught to walk tall, be respectful, do our best and be our best because we
were the Caldwells.  Athleticism as well
as academics was stressed in our home and we certainly excelled in both areas.
As was the norm, on the weekends and during the summer
breaks, we (Dion, myself and the Clanton Park crew) perused all the local parks
like, Freedom, Latta, Park Road, Southside

<p><b>Bull &amp; Stash</b> started with an idea about ideas.</p>
<p>For thinkers and creatives, notebooks are a must. But once they’re full, they end up on a dusty shelf and we have to start over with something new. You’ve got to look around, do a little speed dating in the notebook aisle—it’s hard to find the one. What if you never had to start over in the first place?</p>
<p>Here’s the idea: create a notebook that lasts forever and never runs out of paper. This is it. Beautiful leather binding, carefully selected paper, and a simple design that allows you to replace the pages when they’re full.</p>
<p>For whatever adventures, projects and stories lie ahead of you, we made a notebook that you can take every step of the way.</p>

These woven fabrics have very little stretch naturally, because of their uniform weave and when stretch materials are blended in they typically result in a weaker overall fabric.

It’s made by dyeing yarn, knitting the dyed-yarn into a foundation layer and front layer, and then tightening the front layer with a tensile force greater than a tensile force on the foundation layer.

By knitting the yarn to compose the denim, the denim takes on characteristics of a sort of brushed terry cloth type softness, random knotting similar to regular denim, and even twilling patterns.

Thank you guys, your help in bringing us closer to being able to do what we love is greatly appreciated. Every small step counts and adds up to a great distance to go. Help us bring our talent and ultimately the talents of many others to everyone! 
THESE ARE ONLY THE FIRST FOUR!! (Scroll down to see the original 15 Limited Edition Designs) Over the course of the next few days, we will release 21 BRAND NEW Designs! Make sure to check back daily to see what surprises the PenHead Crowd has for you.
 These designs will look great on any item of your choice. Be sure to follow us on Instagram @penheaddesigns – in there you will find samples of these delightful designs on various items.  
 

 
WIN-WIN Situation! Support our campaign by liking or sharing on Facebook or Twitter by clicking on their buttons on this page, and get a FREE T-SHIRT! Why? Don't ask, just do it! Remember, your referrals MUST visit and donate at our campaign page, using the url www.igg.me/at/penhead



We
want to create a source of affordable and unique clothing and accessories
designs, where you get to provide the core concept for the artist to design
your items, and you customize your item to your own taste.
Every shirt, hoodie,
tank top or phone case will be uniquely created for you to wear; each and every
design will be unrepeatable!


Not
quite! This is a project related to art & artists, in a fashion market.
What makes us unique is:


We want to provide a one-of-a-kind
service where each and every customer gets their own unique and unrepeatable
design in a fun, interactive and affordable experience.


We seek to become a job source for
independent, talented people who wish to start a career in this path by gaining
clothing design experience.


We are not a group of
renowned artists; we are starters just like you, who would love to turn our
passion into our living, and be able to bring more dreamers to join us!



Simple: we want this to be an interactive and
fun experience where both parts contribute to the creation: 
SHIPPING: PenHead offers standard ground
shipping for FREE in the USA & Canada. Shipping outside the USA &
Canada is only available to Mexico during our IndieGoGo campaign, for a small
additional shipping fee.  



 


We want to be
an AFFORDABLE source of UNIQUE and UNREPEATABLE clothing and accessories
designs with the best quality, where you get to provide the core concept for
the artist to design your items. 

We
seek to become a job source for independent, talented people who wish to start
a career in this path by gaining their initial clothing design experiences.


We
have seen many artists show their work on their Facebook, Instagram, blogs, or
many other sites. It would be great if more people could get to witness their
talent – or better yet, get to WEAR their talent!

 

Right
now, we are only a team of three people who love drawing, sketching and designing.
With your help, we can make this bigger and move our operations to an independent website, where we can serve
as a platform for talented people to work on unique, authentic and unrepeatable
designs for each and every customer’s clothes and accessories. 
With your contribution, we can
invest in the following:



Buying a scanner! Right now we have been borrowing a scanner, or going to places where we can scan our designs for a small fee. 


Independent website creation by vendor or freelancers – jobs for others


Mobile version of website or an app – more jobs for others


Scaling up the demand so we can involve more artists – more jobs for others!


Material & Software for our artists – more professional designing 


Local & web training for our artists to continue growing and developing


Budget for further operations


Backing other projects! We will definitely use a generous amount of the contributions we receive to contribute ourselves on other projects.





With
this campaign, we want people to get to know us and our special art product. We
want you to wear our art and help us spread the word so our concept can grow
and become a stable job source for us and others. 
For
this launch and first batch, we have set $10,000.00 as our initial goal:

</h3><p><br/></p><h3></h3><p> During the past two months, and especially during Ramadan, we took a
 break from the workshops for the trainees to spend more time with their
 families and to observe the Holy Month. At the same time, the INAASH 
office has been under renovation, and I have been in London working on 
my MA and preparing for my imminent return to Beirut to resume the 
second phase of the project. We are now all looking forward to 
reactivating the training at the beginning of/mid August.</p><p> There
 are 14 trainees from four different Palestinian Refugee Camps in 
Lebanon, all of whom have shown great commitment and accomplishment. To 
date, these participants have mastered thirteen of the fifteen stitches.
 They are already producing samples and prototypes to be incorporated 
into the INAASH itinerary of products. .</p><p>
 Thanks to your generous contributions, support, and shares we managed 
to raise more than $12,000.00 (twelve thousand United States Dollars) 
through the indiegogo on-line crowd funding website, and direct 
contributions.</p><p> We are currently working on reviewing our budget, 
including calculating the final total raised taking into account the 
exchange rates on different currencies. This will be publicly accessible
 by the beginning of next month, including a list of the direct 
contributions and contributors, and other information and exciting 
updates as well as our future plans. We will make sure to write you and 
bring all of this to your attention.</p><p> Please do not hesitate to 
contact this page, myself or INAASH if you have any questions or 
suggestions. This project would not have been possible without you – 
THANK YOU!</p><br/><h3><br/></h3><h3>PROJECT UPDATES</h3><p>Since the start of the project, we have been able to teach 13 out of 15 stitches to the participants. We are now on a short break for Ramadan and will resume the training mid July. The latter part of the training will concentrate on the development of the Embroiderer's skills their mastery of stitches and the learning of the last remaining two stitches. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434105208/joxg9typpf6xcw50rl3s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></h3><h3></h3><p>The embroiderers and the designer visiting Malak Abdulrahim Husseini at her house in Beirut to see a collection of Old Palestinian Dresses as part of the training.<br/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>PROJECT SUMMARY<br/>
</h3> FIFTEEN STITCHES (May-August 2015)<br/><br/>
<div> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The ultimate aim of this project is to increase the income and skills of Palestinian Refugee embroiderers, the majority of whom are women, working with the Association for the development of Palestinian Camps in Lebanon (INAASH).</p>
<p>Through a workshop introducing them to
15 new historic Palestinian embroidery techniques to expand their creativity, skills and techniques to produce new
and original work. <br/></p>
<p>The goal is to expand the embroiderers market and
therefore increase their income. This will also re-introduce to the Palestinian
community in Lebanon to techniques which have been seldom used or developed in and
outside of Palestine. It will help keep the stitches, some of which are
hundreds of years old, relevant and ensure their daily use amongst Palestinians wherever they are.</p>
<p>The embroiderers come from different refugee camps around Lebanon, namely <i>Mar
Elias, Rashidiieh, Burj El Shamali, Saida</i>, <i>Baalbeck</i>.<br/></p>
<p><b>By supporting this project you
will be helping:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Raise
the income of embroiders by developing their skills and increasing the variety
of their products<br/>
<span><span></span></span>
</li>
<li>Develop
and refine the work of Palestinian embroiderers in refugee camps in Lebanon</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Expand
INAASH’s library of stiches and embroidery techniques</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Ensure
the continuity of Palestinian historical traditions of dressmaking and
embroidery </li>
<li>Promote
the variety and creativity of Palestinian embroidery and dressmaking</li>
</ul>
<p>To date no collective,
organisation, or charity engaged in Palestinian embroidery both in and outside
of Palestine uses more than 7 embroidery techniques at the most. With their
original mastery of cross-stitch, herringbone stitch, patchwork and bar stain stitch
INAASH’s embroiderers will be one of the first to work and eventually master at
least 18 different stitches from all over Palestine.</p>
<p>The workshop will be organised
and run by Palestinian designer, OmarJoseph Nasser-Khoury. He has been working with INAASH and several other Palestinian organisations in Palestine since 2009 on to
expanding the understanding of Palestinian dress and its relevance as a dynamic design practice. <br/></p>

<h3>ABOUT US<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<br/><p><b>THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PALESTINIAN CAMPS <br/></b></p>
<p>The Association for the Development of
Palestinian Camps in Lebanon (INAASH), was founded in the late 1960s by a group of
Lebanese and Palestinian women who foresaw the need to preserve the rich
heritage of Palestinian embroidery, and simultaneously provide financial
support for destitute refugee families in camps in Lebanon.<br/>
<br/>
The first embroidery workshop opened in Shatila Camp in 1968; followed by a
second, with a kindergarten and dispensary, in 1974. Since that time almost
10,000 women have been trained; they have produced close to three million
pieces of handiwork.</p>
<p>Inaash supports over 250 pre-school camp 
children in early education programs. Its pre-school places the children
 of its female embroiderers in a safe learning environment while 
allowing their mothers time and space to work. Over the years, thousands
 of children have completed this early education program and continued 
on in the UNRWA school system. <br/></p>

<p>OmarJoseph
Nasser-Khoury (b.1988) is a Palestinian designer from Al-Quds and Birzeit. For his first design collection, he worked closely with
INAASH to produce 22 garments that were exhibited in 2011 at the Mosaic Rooms
Gallery in London on the fringes of Fashion Week. One of the jackets embroidered
by INNASH in that collection was subsequently acquired by the British Museum in
London as an example of the contemporary development of Palestinian design and
embroidery. Nasser-Khoury is currently on an MA course in Social
Anthropology at Goldsmiths College in London, concentrating his studies on
Palestinian dress and design. <b>As part of this project he also hopes to conduct
part of his fieldwork research on embroidery and design practices whilst running
this workshop. </b>To know more about his fieldwork and dissertation go to this link: <a href=""http://omarivs.tumblr.com/post/116385106515/goldsmiths-ma-social-anthropology-dissertation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://omarivs.tumblr.com/post/116385106515/goldsmiths-ma-social-anthropology-dissertation</a><b><br/></b></p>

<p><b>In Case We Do Not Meet Our Goal</b><br/></p>
<p>The minimum funding should cover the designer's
travel and living expenses in Beirut and the travel expenses of the trainees from the camps. If we do not meet our funding goal, the designer could look for accommodation with friends if possible, and we could look to cut the Per Diem stipends for the trainees. In terms of materials we can look for recycled fabrics
and leftovers as well as borrow what we need in terms of tools (scissors,
needles…etc). The same goes for stationary, where it would be possible to
recycle, borrow and reuse material.

Whatever extra funding we are left with
will go to INAASH as a donation to support their future work and development in
the camps</p>
<p>Any donations in kind, in terms of material for the workshop or accommodation for the designer will also be very helpful.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>HOW IS THIS PROJECT DIFFERENT?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>What distinguishes this project is that it's the first of it's kind. Upon the completion of this project, INAASH's embroiderers will be the first to master almost 20 historical stitches from all over historic Palestine.<br/></p>
<p>Moreover INAASH already provides a market for all of its embroiderers.
This basically means that all newly learnt skills and techniques will be put
into more production and use. There will be no waste of time or effort, and the
project will not simply stop at the end of the training workshop. INAASH will be able to introduce more variety and creativity in terms of
products and therefore expand their market and sales, which eventually means
higher returns for their embroiderers.</p>
<p>INAASH already sell their
products at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and has had many pop-up
shops around the world, besides their permanent shop in Beirut. Their work,
along with OmarJoseph’s is collected by the British Museum in London. <br/></p>
<p>OmarJoseph Has been involved in
researching and exhibition making with Birzeit University Museum in Palestine
since 2010, where he has produced three exhibitions on Palestinian Dress and
design. He has also worked with the Danish House in Palestine (DHIP) from 2012
to 2014 on a similar design project to train Palestinian craftswomen and
fashion students in Fashion design and Palestinian dressmaking. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLANGES<br/>
</h3> <p>The main challenges we anticipate are shaped by the harsh reality that the embroiders face as stateless refugees living for more than 66 years in the camps throughout Lebanon.  In addition to their pressing responsibilities (families to look after, especially since the great majority of the embroiderers are women) making any involvement in long term projects difficult, most trainees face great difficulties in terms of movment and travel. <br/></p>
<p>The workshop is therefore designed so that no matter how little time a trainee can spare they will leave with at least one skill mastered which they will be able to use and pass on. The workshop is based on learning at least two stitches per day, and ensuring that least one is mastered . Each trainee is  expected to return to their community where they are always interacting with other INAASH embroiderers and pass on their new skills. This is both the historical and contemporary way in which most dressmaking and embroidery skills were passed on in Palestine. From parent to child, sibling to sibling, friend to friend.</p>

<br/>
<p>It also goes without saying that the trainer will not only be there to share his knowledge, but to also share the experience and knowledge of the embroiderers themselves who already have years of experience in the field. This is particularly worth mentioning especially since OmarJoseph Nasser-Khoury will be simultaneously conducting part of his fieldwork research for his MA studies. The trainees will be made fully aware of this and their participation in any research will be entirely voluntary.<br/></p>

</div></div>","UPDATE :: 31 July 2015
 During the past two months, and especially during Ramadan, we took a
 break from the workshops for the trainees to spend more time with their
 families and to observe the Holy Month. At the same time, the INAASH 
office has been under renovation, and I have been in London working on 
my MA and preparing for my imminent return to Beirut to resume the 
second phase of the project. We are now all looking forward to 
reactivating the training at the beginning of/mid August. There
 are 14 trainees from four different Palestinian Refugee Camps in 
Lebanon, all of whom have shown great commitment and accomplishment. To 
date, these participants have mastered thirteen of the fifteen stitches.
 They are already producing samples and prototypes to be incorporated 
into the INAASH itinerary of products. .
 Thanks to your generous contributions, support, and shares we managed 
to raise more than $12,000.00 (twelve thousand United States Dollars) 
through the indiegogo on-line crowd funding website, and direct 
contributions. We are currently working on reviewing our budget, 
including calculating the final total raised taking into account the 
exchange rates on different currencies. This will be publicly accessible
 by the beginning of next month, including a list of the direct 
contributions and contributors, and other information and exciting 
updates as well as our future plans. We will make sure to write you and 
bring all of this to your attention. Please do not hesitate to 
contact this page, myself or INAASH if you have any questions or 
suggestions. This project would not have been possible without you – 
THANK YOU!PROJECT UPDATESSince the start of the project, we have been able to teach 13 out of 15 stitches to the participants. We are now on a short break for Ramadan and will resume the training mid July. The latter part of the training will concentrate on the development of the Embroiderer's skills their mastery of stitches and the learning of the last remaining two stitches. The embroiderers and the designer visiting Malak Abdulrahim Husseini at her house in Beirut to see a collection of Old Palestinian Dresses as part of the training.PROJECT SUMMARY
 FIFTEEN STITCHES (May-August 2015)
 

The ultimate aim of this project is to increase the income and skills of Palestinian Refugee embroiderers, the majority of whom are women, working with the Association for the development of Palestinian Camps in Lebanon (INAASH).
Through a workshop introducing them to
15 new historic Palestinian embroidery techniques to expand their creativity, skills and techniques to produce new
and original work. 
The goal is to expand the embroiderers market and
therefore increase their income. This will also re-introduce to the Palestinian
community in Lebanon to techniques which have been seldom used or developed in and
outside of Palestine. It will help keep the stitches, some of which are
hundreds of years old, relevant and ensure their daily use amongst Palestinians wherever they are.
The embroiderers come from different refugee camps around Lebanon, namely Mar
Elias, Rashidiieh, Burj El Shamali, Saida, Baalbeck.
By supporting this project you
will be helping:

Raise
the income of embroiders by developing their skills and increasing the variety
of their products


Develop
and refine the work of Palestinian embroiderers in refugee camps in Lebanon

Expand
INAASH’s library of stiches and embroidery techniques

Ensure
the continuity of Palestinian historical traditions of dressmaking and
embroidery 
Promote
the variety and creativity of Palestinian embroidery and dressmaking

To date no collective,
organisation, or charity engaged in Palestinian embroidery both in and outside
of Palestine uses more than 7 embroidery techniques at the most. With their
original mastery of cross-stitch, herringbone stitch, patchwork and bar stain stitch
INAASH’s embroiderers will be one of the first to work and eventually master at
least 18 different stitches from all over Palestine.
The workshop will be organised
and run by Palestinian designer, OmarJoseph Nasser-Khoury. He has been working with INAASH and several other Palestinian organisations in Palestine since 2009 on to
expanding the understanding of Palestinian dress and its relevance as a dynamic design practice.

ABOUT US


THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PALESTINIAN CAMPS 
The Association for the Development of
Palestinian Camps in Lebanon (INAASH), was founded in the late 1960s by a group of
Lebanese and Palestinian women who foresaw the need to preserve the rich
heritage of Palestinian embroidery, and simultaneously provide financial
support for destitute refugee families in camps in Lebanon.

The first embroidery workshop opened in Shatila Camp in 1968; followed by a
second, with a kindergarten and dispensary, in 1974. Since that time almost
10,000 women have been trained; they have produced close to three million
pieces of handiwork.
Inaash supports over 250 pre-school camp 
children in early education programs. Its pre-school places the children
 of its female embroiderers in a safe learning environment while 
allowing their mothers time and space to work. Over the years, thousands
 of children have completed this early education program and continued 
on in the UNRWA school system.

OMARJOSEPH NASSER-KHOURY (Omarivs Ioseph Filivs Dinæ)


OmarJoseph
Nasser-Khoury (b.1988) is a Palestinian designer from Al-Quds and Birzeit. For his first design collection, he worked closely with
INAASH to produce 22 garments that were exhibited in 2011 at the Mosaic Rooms
Gallery in London on the fringes of Fashion Week. One of the jackets embroidered
by INNASH in that collection was subsequently acquired by the British Museum in
London as an example of the contemporary development of Palestinian design and
embroidery. Nasser-Khoury is currently on an MA course in Social
Anthropology at Goldsmiths College in London, concentrating his studies on
Palestinian dress and design. As part of this project he also hopes to conduct
part of his fieldwork research on embroidery and design practices whilst running
this workshop. To know more about his fieldwork and dissertation go to this link: http://omarivs.tumblr.com/post/116385106515/goldsmiths-ma-social-anthropology-dissertation

<p>Work
is in progress! <b>We have more than 40 emerging and established designers
on our books </b>who are keen to reach their international audience and
make new friends through Fashion Bloc. The only missing particle is a <b>brand
new website </b>(our current home is built on Word Press). This is our
next step to further grow our business. Our second step will be to introduce a
pop-up gallery in London where our customers will be able to explore the

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div></div>
<p>We
are raising funds to build a new website with a fully integrated multi-brand
E-commerce (online gallery-shop) allowing designers located across Europe to
sell to the International customers. We will need to build a complicated
E-Commerce platform in order to manage multi-site stock and to ensure best
customer service quality. <b>We aim to raise at least £12 000</b> to
build, launch and promote a new Fashion Bloc platform. We have already invested
more than £2000 of our personal funds to start the development of a new
website.</p>
<p><b>The
money raised will be used on:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>New website + E-Commerce
     (enabling online advertising)</li>
<li>Initial marketing campaign</li>
<li>Legal services</li>
<li>Launch party followed by the
     pop-up gallery in London</li>
</ul>
<p>In
reality, we need much more than £12K but this amount should help us access
additional financing towards further development and growth. If for some
unfortunate reason we won't be able to reach our aim of £12K, we will still use
the money received for the development of the website, although it might affect
our <b>deadline which is the first quarter of 2015</b>. Ideally, we are
aiming to organize an amazing Eastern European fashion and art feast (filled
with quality fashion, music and not your traditional type of delicacies) by the
end of February.</p>

Short Summary

Welcome
to Fashion Bloc - a virtual gallery introducing you to the undiscovered fashion
destinations in Europe. www.fashionbloc.co.uk is
a one step place for fashion lovers to meet, explore and shop independent
fashion designers from emerging fashion region. We aim to create a bridge
between Western audience and talented designers from Eastern Europe by
helping the designers reach their international followers.



Fashion Bloc was launched in 2013 by me, Ieva
Zubaviciute, a Lithuanian based in London. Fashion journalist by degree and
luxury fashion recruiter by profession I have launched Fashion Bloc out of my
personal interest in new fashion destinations. I come from the Baltic States
and I am aware of the situation - the fashion
talent has been overlooked!



In march 2014 I met my current business partner Martin
Kucera who raised the question - how can a growing crowd of Fashion Bloc
followers buy those designer items they see on the website? This is when we
came up with an idea to launch an online gallery-shop together
with the existing online magazine about Eastern European fashion.





Mother Eleganza, Lithuania



Work
is in progress! We have more than 40 emerging and established designers
on our books who are keen to reach their international audience and
make new friends through Fashion Bloc. The only missing particle is a brand
new website (our current home is built on Word Press). This is our
next step to further grow our business. Our second step will be to introduce a
pop-up gallery in London where our customers will be able to explore the
selected items of the designers, buy them and order to be delivered from our
E-Commerce.




What We Need & What You Get


We
are raising funds to build a new website with a fully integrated multi-brand
E-commerce (online gallery-shop) allowing designers located across Europe to
sell to the International customers. We will need to build a complicated
E-Commerce platform in order to manage multi-site stock and to ensure best
customer service quality. We aim to raise at least £12 000 to
build, launch and promote a new Fashion Bloc platform. We have already invested
more than £2000 of our personal funds to start the development of a new
website.
The
money raised will be used on:

New website + E-Commerce
     (enabling online advertising)
Initial marketing campaign
Legal services
Launch party followed by the
     pop-up gallery in London

In
reality, we need much more than £12K but this amount should help us access
additional financing towards further development and growth. If for some
unfortunate reason we won't be able to reach our aim of £12K, we will still use
the money received for the development of the website, although it might affect
our deadline which is the first quarter of 2015. Ideally, we are
aiming to organize an amazing Eastern European fashion and art feast (filled
with quality fashion, music and not your traditional type of delicacies) by the
end of February.

The Impact



A very important thing to note - by supporting
this campaign (either by donating, or by spreading the word and sharing your
ideas with us) you are becoming a part of the history. In the face of the
challenges Eastern Europe is facing (followed by the political crisis in
Ukraine), we are trying to
raise awareness through fashion, which is an international
language. We aim to show the world that Eastern Europe (including the Baltic
States and Central Eastern Europe) is a hidden fashion gem growing and
producing talented, forward thinking, internationally oriented fashion artists
and creativity overall. Fashion is not just London, Paris, Milan and New York. Fashion is Kiev, Vilnius, Tallinn,
Lodz and many more European cities. By promoting fashion designers from
former Eastern Bloc countries (yes, right, this is what Fashion Bloc stands
for) we also promote these countries minimizing a gap
between Eastern and Western Europe.

Risks & Challenges
 
The right timing, focus and

Fashion Bloc's success belongs not

challenge is to constantly grow our audience. Every piece of art looks sad if
nobody is looking at it.
Without a new multi-functional

audience at the right time - please do spread the word!

<div>At the 2015 Experimental Fashion Event, artists and designers from the MICA Fiber Department’s Multi Media Event class work collaboratively to transform The Lithuanian Hall into a venue for innovative fashion and garment based performance. During the event, students present their individually crafted garment-based works, pushing the boundaries of fashion and art. The fashion event represents a variety of concepts and skill sets, with work speaking to the performative nature of fashion. The evening will involve more than 200 people, including designers, and their hand-selected models and performers.</div>
<p>We would like to raise at least $3,000 for our event. The majority of this money will go towards paying for our location, the Lithuanian Hall in southwest Baltimore. This location will cost us approximately $2,000 to rent for the time we need. The other funds will be used to rent lighting and sound equipment, as the hall has none for us to use. In order to achieve this goal we have created some great perks for you! These include tote bags and t-shirts that will be hand screen-printed by the designers, photographic prints of our work, and even a VIP experience at the show!</p>

<p><i>""Those early years of mine were spent in the shadows, hiding in my shame, holding onto a dark secret that was destroying my self worth. I sometimes still find it hard to believe that I was sexually abused as a child. It lead me down a path of ultimate destruction, and as I teetered on the brink I somehow found the courage to look away and begin my journey back. The road back has been bumpy and uneven but has been worth it. It's on this road that I discovered myself again. It's here that I realized that I'm actually worth something and that shame is the enemy of self worth. Finally, I've realized that self worth is a journey to be embraced, not a destination."" <b>-Andy Ryan</b></i></p>
<p><i>""Growing up there was a strong presence of abandonment and rejection over my life. My real father was in another country with a new family, and we didn't meet for the first time until I was 17. My step-father was present but never accepted me as his own.  It seemed that wherever I turned, I was an unwanted burden. This hugely affected my self-worth and understanding that I am lovable, acceptable and beautiful. I'm still learning this by rejecting the lies of my past, and instead choosing daily to believe the fact that I am endlessly valuable. I'm not perfect and struggle often, but forgiveness has given me the freedom to redefine my worth. We cannot erase people's  decisions that have impacted us, but we can choose how much they affect our future."" <b>-Micaela Hollins</b></i></p>
<p><i>""Growing up there were multiple lies that were spoken over my life; I was not good enough, I was unlovable, I was not pretty enough, and I certainly was not smart enough to change any of these thoughts about myself. At sixteen all these thoughts that I believed were confirmed by my biological parents giving me away to a new family. This made me feel like I wasn't worth loving. My self-worth was replaced with self-hate and addictions. After a many challenging years of discovering my self-worth I have learned that those thoughts ARE lies and that I am not who others say I am. Although, I still struggle with these lies it is essential to daily make an effort to determine my thought process in order to accept the love that I deserve. You can't change what others think of you, but you can shout words of love to the lies you believe and begin on the journey to loving yourself well!"" <b>-Melissa Damminger</b></i></p>

<p>Hi, my name is Anna Chiatti, I’m an italian shoe designer and stylist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last past years I worked for several Tuscan shoe factories. Recently I decided to create my own personal collection, called “Anna Chiatti Firenze”. The brand is defined by my name and my city. My approach is based on the innovative technique of using TPU for the bottom of the shoe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TPU is a colorful and translucent rubber which allows for ornaments even on the upper. From the beginning of my adventure, I'm surrounded by precious people with whom I have created a very collaborative team. Thanks to them, it was possible to refine what once was just an idea. I believe that the result is a really innovative shoe, fashionable and comfortable at the same time, thanks to the rubber sole.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/390793/files/20140224062309-tpu1.jpg?1393251789"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why crowdfunding?</h3><p>
</p><p>To promote my "" Anna Chiatti Firenze"" brand, I need a sample collection. In order to develop the next sample collection, you first need to study trends in fashion, accessories, high heels, everything that can be useful to design and draw the prototypes. In a second phase, I will have to contact the manufacturers and suppliers of individual components, such as factories heels, factories forms, tanneries, uppers and soles factories, which are fundamental for assembling shoes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sample collection will be my business card and is required to present my brand to Italian and foreign buyers. Unfortunately, producing a sample collection is very expensive, especially if itʼs entirely made in Italy, as is my case. The Spring Summer 2015 sample collection will allow me to participate in trade fairs like the Micam Shoe Event in Milan and the “Shoes from Italy” exhibition in Tokyo.</p><p>
</p><p>Up to the present, I have used my personal economic resources to pursue this project. Now I need to invest more and I need the aid of those who believe in my idea.</p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Reflection of Elegance</h3><p></p>My project was born from the desire to share with other women the opportunity to be beautiful without sacrificing comfort, wearing shoes with original design but suitable for any time of the day. Businesswomen ourselves, mothers, lovers, workers and housewives: each of us is at the same time all this and much more! My line of fashion shoes includes desires and aspirations of dynamic and resolute women that want to live a bright life in a reflection of elegance!<p></p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How to support me </h3><p>

Ciao, mi chiamo Anna Chiatti, sono una stilista e modellista calzaturiera. Per molti anni ho lavorato per alcuni calzaturifici toscani, ma da qualche tempo ho deciso di realizzare una mia collezione personale, la Anna Chiatti Firenze, un brand definito dal mio nome e dalla mia città.
Ho deciso di affacciarmi sul mercato nazionale ed estero avendo studiato ed elaborato un’idea nuova: una scarpa con un fondo in TPU! Il TPU è una gomma colorata e semitrasparente, utilizzabile anche con dei richiami sulla tomaia. Per questo la linea Anna Chiatti Firenze è unica ed esclusiva.
All’inizio della mia avventura mi sono circondata di persone valide con cui ho creato un team molto collaborativo. Grazie a loro, è stato possibile perfezionare quello che prima era solo un’idea. Credo che il risultato sia una scarpa davvero innovativa, fashion e allo stesso comoda, grazie alla suola in gomma.Perché il crowdfunding?
Per promuovere la linea “ Anna Chiatti Firenze” ho bisogno di un campionario. Per realizzarlo occorre studiare le tendenze della moda, gli accessori, i tacchi, tutto ciò insomma che può essere utile per ideare e disegnare i modelli.
Poi vanno contattati i produttori e fornitori delle singole componenti, come tacchifici, formifici, concerie, suolifici e tomaifici, fondamentali per assemblare le scarpe.
Il campionario è il mio biglietto da visita ed è necessario per proporsi ai compratori italiani ed esteri, ma purtroppo è molto costoso soprattutto se realizzato interamente in italia come nel mio caso.
Grazie al nuovo campionario Primavera Estate 2015 potrò partecipare a fiere come il Micam di Milano e la fiera della calzatura a Tokyo.
Fino ad ora ho utilizzato le mie risorse economiche personali ma per proseguire in questo progetto ho bisogno di investire ancora e dell’aiuto di chi crede nella mia idea.I riflessi dell'eleganzaIl mio progetto nasce dal desiderio di condividere con le altre donne la possibilità di essere belle senza rinunciare alla comodità, indossando calzature dal design originale e adatto ad ogni momento della giornata.

Per sostenere la prossima collezione firmata “Anna chiatti Firenze” dai un’occhiata alla colonna dei perks. Troverai, oltre alle mie scarpe, una serie di accessori realizzati seguendo lo stile della collezione. Anche il tuo più piccolo contributo è indispensabile.

<h3>About the Artist </h3>
<p>My name is Tamao Nakayama. I was born in Tokyo, Japan, and raised by a master Kimono maker. There were many craftsmen in my neighborhood at that time.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Since I make everything in my own studio, the risk is minimal. The only challenge I might face is that if this is to be a wildly successful campaign (a wonderful problem to have!), I may need more time to produce the perks. Ideally, I want to send out all perks to everyone by Christmas (so you’ll get an extra present under the tree!). But because I don't know how many orders I will get from this campaign, I am putting an estimated ship date of December 31st, 2018 to give myself a little extra time.  If any issues do arise, I will burn the midnight oil to make sure everyone receives their pieces on time, as that is my highest priority.</p>
<p>I understand not everyone likes the idea of crowdfunding, so if you don't, feel free to purchase any of these items from my online shop (but at a higher rate). I’m preparing to open my online shop in January 2019.</p>

My name is Tamao Nakayama. I was born in Tokyo, Japan, and raised by a master Kimono maker. There were many craftsmen in my neighborhood at that time. A lot of houses were still in the traditional style. The wooden windows, Washi paper doors, and rice straw mattresses were big elements in Japanese architecture. I was surrounded by those natural materials and grew up watching old craftsmen create their one-of-a-kind crafts.
Even though I’ve been living in the US (California) and I am far from traditional, I'm often surprised that my artwork does look strongly Japanese.

The unisex is a
 crew necked t-shirt and the Womens shirt has a scoop neck with a more 
fitted cut. Toddler sizes come in  2, 4, and 6. The infant onesie is 100% cotton and super soft.

Built into our business plan, Heartsleeve gives an average of $2 of every T-shirt sale to a corresponding partner Cause. For our Bayou design, we're partnering with the Louisiana Master Naturalists of Greater New Orleans (LMNGNO). This non-profit organizes educational outings for about 30 adults each semester. The program immerses locals in the beautiful and fragile environment of Southeast Louisiana to teach them about the plants, animals, and threats to the region. Tuition costs $250 per person, so Heartsleeve is partnering with the LMNGNO to set up a scholarship for folks who demonstrate a personal investment in learning about our coast yet cannot afford the tuition.  We want to eliminate the cost barrier for those passionate to learn about Louisiana’s prolific but disappearing coast.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/782022/files/20140812021304-Indiegogo_Swamp_mini.jpg?1407834784"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/778245/files/20140810114423-IndieGoGo_Title_Banners-04.jpg?1407696263"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We've got a couple of ways you can help us launch Heartsleeve:<br/><br/><p>1.

Our Indiegogo campaign launches Heartsleeve’s first design and aims to cover many of our one-time start up costs.Heartsleeve T-shirts are designed in pairs, with two people (best friends, siblings, couples, parent & child, pet owner & dog) - the giver and the receiver - in mind. Our first pair is the I Want to be Bayou line, featuring Louisiana swamp locals, the alligator and the crawfish. The blue shirt showcases an amorous crawfish, while the grey shirt shows a gator with a kiss mark on it's snout. The pair of shirts is stylistically similar in design and color, but both remain unique. If you just want one, that’s cool too. However, by designing our shirts in pairs, we encourage people to share the pair with someone they love. A strong community is made up of strong relationships, and two friends representing their shared style with a funky Tee is a fun way to show some love for each other and our partner Cause.We print on soft tri-blend tees for all the adult and youth sizes. The unisex is a
 crew necked t-shirt and the Womens shirt has a scoop neck with a more 
fitted cut. Toddler sizes come in  2, 4, and 6. The infant onesie is 100% cotton and super soft. The puppy tee is a jersey blend, white with navy sleeves.
Built into our business plan, Heartsleeve gives an average of $2 of every T-shirt sale to a corresponding partner Cause. For our Bayou design, we're partnering with the Louisiana Master Naturalists of Greater New Orleans (LMNGNO). This non-profit organizes educational outings for about 30 adults each semester. The program immerses locals in the beautiful and fragile environment of Southeast Louisiana to teach them about the plants, animals, and threats to the region. Tuition costs $250 per person, so Heartsleeve is partnering with the LMNGNO to set up a scholarship for folks who demonstrate a personal investment in learning about our coast yet cannot afford the tuition.  We want to eliminate the cost barrier for those passionate to learn about Louisiana’s prolific but disappearing coast.We've got a couple of ways you can help us launch Heartsleeve:1.
 Check out those perks on the right and find a level you like (and a 
perk you love) and let us reward you with our original designed tees.2.

This membrane should stop water from entering but should also permit the sweat to evaporate. Unfortunately, most outerwear contains warming substances that are detrimental to the environment. Wear and tear, as well as regular washing, release non-degradable carcinogenic toxins, as well as microplastics, into the atmosphere and the oceans. In fact, those waterproof and breathable membranes are very often made from a fluorine-containing polymer, which also contains very toxic chemicals, called PFCs. The Detox Campaign from Greenpeace brought to light the effect of those PFCs in the nature (<a href=""http://detox-outdoor.org/en/campaign/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://detox-outdoor.org/en/campaign/</a>)  and is also what motivated us to find an alternative.</p><p>Now, an innovation is here to change all that, taking a cue from nature itself: Sane Membrane. This non-toxic alternative is mineral-based, fluorine-free, and has the option to be biodegradable.

This membrane should stop water from entering but should also permit the sweat to evaporate. Unfortunately, most outerwear contains warming substances that are detrimental to the environment. Wear and tear, as well as regular washing, release non-degradable carcinogenic toxins, as well as microplastics, into the atmosphere and the oceans. In fact, those waterproof and breathable membranes are very often made from a fluorine-containing polymer, which also contains very toxic chemicals, called PFCs. The Detox Campaign from Greenpeace brought to light the effect of those PFCs in the nature (http://detox-outdoor.org/en/campaign/)  and is also what motivated us to find an alternative.Now, an innovation is here to change all that, taking a cue from nature itself: Sane Membrane. This non-toxic alternative is mineral-based, fluorine-free, and has the option to be biodegradable. And it keeps clothes warm and dry just as effectively as its substitutes.  Technologydimpora's sane membrane is the result of 5 years of high tech research in Switzerland and is now being brought to the next level.The technology involves the use of a sacrificial template that is mixed within the polymer to take up a certain volume. Once dry, this mineral-based template is removed from the membrane, leaving behind interconnected voids, thus forming the porous system, which body needs to breathe!How is it done?We take a polymer. We started with a tradtional material (PU, polyurethane) to show that we can do it. We will use biosourced, biodegradable and recycleable options for further generations. The process is open to change, so are we. We take the mineral based template, rocks basically.We mix them. This is key and we do it properly!Produce a Membrane. This is done on a machine, spreading it by hand does not afford the regularity we want!We release the rocks and create the pores:...and we are done with a waterproof and breathable membrane for your outdoor pleasures.Thanks to the liquid state of the membrane precursor, it can be seamlessly added to any garment, in the form of a micro-thin layer that shields against rain, snow, and other forces of nature...the sustainable way.In other words, defense against chill, wind, and rain, can be as natural as Mother Nature herself.Protect yourself. Protect the planet. Mario, CEOMario is a Swiss chemical engineer on paper but a business man in his heart (a good one, promise!). During his master thesis and PhD, he followed his dream of bringing a fluorine-free functional membrane to the market after the Greenpeace detox campaign put the spotlight on the PFCs, that are used in conventional waterproofing equipment. With new polymer options he will add circularity to the membrane world! He is passionate about fishing, skiing and spends most of his free time in the mountains.Anna, CTOAnna also comes from Switzerland and is a chemical engineer with a strong connection to science and has a real passion for Research & Development. She was always very involved in sustainability in her research as her PhD involved the development of new polymeric materials for CO2-capture and microplastics tracing. dimpora membranes will not leave a trace. As an avid skier and hiker, Anna is also very motivated to wear products that will not harm the very nature she enjoys.  Together, dimporaAfter studying together at ETH Zurich, Mario and Anna discovered the joy & challenges that comes with bringing your idea to life. The two are highly motivated to continue this journey towards a more transparent and eco-friendly product for the textile world together.  With the money raised, we will focus on our biodegradable membrane to  avoid any unecessary plastic waste on our planet. This means that we still need a little bit of research and then most importantly, scale-up our technology and bring it to market! We gathered a few amazing and very personal perks. We hope you will enjoy them too and help us achieve our goal.The rewards:1. Support our cause with 25€ Donation and we (Anna & Mario) will make a thank you video from the Swiss Alps naming all of you directly. (Let us know if you don't want your name to show up)2. A high quality sustainable cotton shopping bag 40€ with dimpora logo on it. Cut back unnecessary plastic by taking your tote bag with you every day! It does not contain any membrane.3. A merino cap made in Switzerland for 90€ with dimpora logo on it. It will keep you warm wherever you need it. It does not contain any membrane.4. Meet the team 300€. Come see us in our labs in Zurich Switzerland. See how we work and get insights on the next big challenges in the materials side of the textile industry. 5. dimpora's first and second generation jacket 600€. Be the first to get a jacket with our Polyurethane (PU)-based membrane inside. The membrane is fluorine-free, highly breathable with very good waterproofing properties. The design of the jacket will be provided by Rotauf, a sustainable partner brand from Switzerland. You will be the first to get your hands on the dimpora PU membrane and test the jackets with and for us. Try it in all your adventures for 12 months or less and if you return it with your personal feedback, we will send you a second generation jacket (optimized). The second generation jacket could not have the exact same design. x7. Travel to the Swiss alps with us 2500€. This limited perk involves a full weekend in the alps with us. Depending on the season we can go for example hiking, biking, skiing, fishing... We will take care of the place, food as well as accommodation. This does not involve the transportation costs but we are happy to pick you up at the airport, if this is convenient, as we travel together to the mountains. We can show you the beauty of our homeland and you can enjoy a real Swiss experience.   Thank you!!!! For more questions reach out to us: www.dimpora.comif you feel like keeping updated about the project.

Our story began three years ago, when we successfully launched our first watch NIXOID Classic. NIXIE lamps have not been produced for over thirty years, and every year it becomes more difficult to find untouched lamps that can display the time. We searched for a long time and found an untouched warehouse of lamps from the times of the USSR, and the project became possible.The watch also received tilt sensor,more capacious battery and magnetic charging connector too. Let's further explore what new we have added during this time. We have thoroughly worked out the new case, this also influenced the size of the watch, now they have become more ergonomic. Most importantly, we have introduced the accelerometer function, now there is no need to constantly press the button. We made many prototypes and tested them for a long time.    That's not all we have improved our product in, to find out more, read on.  NIXOID the world's first Dual-core tube wristwatch.  Watch has two cores, a separate core is responsible for processing only accelerometer data.

<p>*** My Story ***</p>
<p>Hello, I'm <span>Eric Rea. I am a designer in the video game industry and a big fan of new technology and design. I have been using 3d programs on and off for over ten years and recently have been exploring the wonders of 3d printing. <br/></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>3d printing is a technology that has recently been
growing incredibly quickly and has all sorts of applications, including medical equipment and adaptive devices. It is the perfect tool I need to make designs for disabled people like myself that will help them overcome frustrating physical hurdles.<br/></p>

You see, I'm not just a designer... I am also a quadriplegic. <span>Because of my disability my hands are paralyzed and it makes
some of the simplest tasks nearly impossible. Imagine the frustration of not being able to use a door knob, or dropping
 your phone every time you pick it up, or constantly hitting the wrong 
key on the keyboard. For folks like us, it feels like the world was designed for alien hands. However, I have been designing my own adaptive devices that help me overcome the limitations of my disability, and now I want to help others do the same. As it happens, I already have a network of disabled people in need of help. </span><p>
</p>
<p>For the last 7 years I have been a volunteer with
the Spinal Cord Injury Peer Mentoring program at the University of Washington. I meet with newly injured quadriplegics<span> who are
ending their long stay at the hospital. Not everyone can afford continuing support from occupational therapists so I
would like to volunteer my help as a professional designer, and as someone
who understands what they’re dealing with. My goal is to
work directly with these folks to help develop custom solutions for their adaptive needs. To</span> achieve this end I need my own 3d printer. <br/></p>
<p>This is where you come in. I need your help raising three thousand dollars to buy a decent 3d printer.  If
enough people give even a small amount, we can raise the money needed for me to enable these people with better tools for independence. If you simply can't afford to donate, help me spread the word!</p>

How Bammies Became a Thing
Rosario Chozas, Co-Founder & Creative Director: Hi Indiegogo! Here's my story... After almost a decade of entrepreneurial endeavors in creative industries, I made a professional move into a more corporate setting, which dictated a different dress code. My coworkers and I would always talk about how I dressed, and how I felt really uncomfortable. I felt like I dressed differently than everyone around me, which made me feel weird and out of place. I tried to replicate the looks around me, but they felt so awkward. Eventually I said to myself, “Wait a minute, I'm a stylist. I know how to handle this.” I thought, ""What are ways I could put together some looks where it would work for both me and my surroundings?"" The way that I was able to resolve being true to myself and feeling appropriate was wearing things that were comfortable. Everyone would see me dressed in a way that was comfortable and then a joke started that I was wearing business jammies. And that's how it came about. I needed to be true to my looks and be comfortable... and make it look good for the office.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>What the Heck is Going on Here?</h3> <p>My name is Krista Cagg. I am an independent/self-published author of the steampunk series: The William's Hunt. More recently, and perhaps most importantly, I am the caregiver for my mother who is suffering from cancer. All of this is a full time job and then some, but I decided to help augment income by getting back into a passion I discovered a dozen or so years ago, that of beading jewelry. Creating something has been and always will be an important part of my life, be it characters/worlds/adventures or some pretty little trinket that augments neck or wrist.</p> </div> <div> <h3>That's Nice, So What do You Want from and What's in it for Us?</h3> <p>Well, self-publishing is a lot of work with very little financial reward. Caring for my mother doesn't pay in any way other than giving back to her what she gave to me for decades. In order to make Shards of Bifrost work I need supplies. When we moved from Olympia, WA to Savannah, GA then to Milton, PA all of my beading supplies were eliminated. I've managed to replace the basics, but I need much, much more.</p>
<p>Because I've done this before I know what I need, what is liked and how to make them. I've even added to what I make, such as stitch markers for knitters. What I didn't have then that I have access to now are places like Etsy where I can set up shop. In addition to that, I attend conventions where I peddle my books. The jewelry will be a fabulous compliment to those, including my plans to create items that reflect the characters and events in my series.</p>
<p>The goal I've set will provide the supplies, cost of marketing online (website, Etsy shop, etc) as well as provide a base to work with for any unexpected financial need that may arise. (Just because I've done it doesn't mean I'm flawless.) I will be attending ConNooga in Chattanooga, TN the last weekend in February, and I intend to have a good representation of jewelry to sell along side my book, The Milan Job. From there I will travel to Savannah, GA for Gnomecon the following weekend. (And if you are attending either con stop by and say hello!)</p>
<p>In addition to the jewelry I offer as perks of this fundraiser, I've had some absolutely fantastic people donate items. Words cannot describe the gratitude I feel for the support they have shown me! Have a look at what's available in the Perks, and photographs of the items are in the gallery!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Yeah, and This Makes You Special How?</h3> <p>I'm a stubborn old mule who refuses to roll over and take it! I just need some help from time to time. This is one of those times! Things are tight for my husband and I since he's the only one bringing in a paycheck of any substance at the moment. Mom's health requires someone at home with her at all times. While this allows me time to write self-publishing doesn't bring in as much as is needed. Shards of Bifrost would add to that as a less risky endeavor. And beading is a nice change when the Writer's Block Goblin steals my brain.</p>

</div></div>","What the Heck is Going on Here? My name is Krista Cagg. I am an independent/self-published author of the steampunk series: The William's Hunt. More recently, and perhaps most importantly, I am the caregiver for my mother who is suffering from cancer. All of this is a full time job and then some, but I decided to help augment income by getting back into a passion I discovered a dozen or so years ago, that of beading jewelry. Creating something has been and always will be an important part of my life, be it characters/worlds/adventures or some pretty little trinket that augments neck or wrist.   That's Nice, So What do You Want from and What's in it for Us? Well, self-publishing is a lot of work with very little financial reward. Caring for my mother doesn't pay in any way other than giving back to her what she gave to me for decades. In order to make Shards of Bifrost work I need supplies. When we moved from Olympia, WA to Savannah, GA then to Milton, PA all of my beading supplies were eliminated. I've managed to replace the basics, but I need much, much more.
Because I've done this before I know what I need, what is liked and how to make them. I've even added to what I make, such as stitch markers for knitters. What I didn't have then that I have access to now are places like Etsy where I can set up shop. In addition to that, I attend conventions where I peddle my books. The jewelry will be a fabulous compliment to those, including my plans to create items that reflect the characters and events in my series.
The goal I've set will provide the supplies, cost of marketing online (website, Etsy shop, etc) as well as provide a base to work with for any unexpected financial need that may arise. (Just because I've done it doesn't mean I'm flawless.) I will be attending ConNooga in Chattanooga, TN the last weekend in February, and I intend to have a good representation of jewelry to sell along side my book, The Milan Job. From there I will travel to Savannah, GA for Gnomecon the following weekend. (And if you are attending either con stop by and say hello!)
In addition to the jewelry I offer as perks of this fundraiser, I've had some absolutely fantastic people donate items. Words cannot describe the gratitude I feel for the support they have shown me! Have a look at what's available in the Perks, and photographs of the items are in the gallery!
    Yeah, and This Makes You Special How? I'm a stubborn old mule who refuses to roll over and take it! I just need some help from time to time. This is one of those times! Things are tight for my husband and I since he's the only one bringing in a paycheck of any substance at the moment. Mom's health requires someone at home with her at all times. While this allows me time to write self-publishing doesn't bring in as much as is needed. Shards of Bifrost would add to that as a less risky endeavor. And beading is a nice change when the Writer's Block Goblin steals my brain.

<b>Mara is <span>a strap-free,
     hands-free, truly wearable and really invisible
     couples vibrator.</span></b>  So wearable and invisible - you can wear it under <span>a bikini without anyone
     noticing. <b>You can even swim with Mara - </b>One of the
     greatest orgasms women experience happens in water :) Or you can join
     the Mile High Club and experience
     a seismic orgasm while flying.
     Solo or with your partner involved - no matter where he or she is at that
     moment, next to you or on another
     continent. Due to its anatomical shape, Mara will fit perfectly into your vagina,
     holding the clitoral part directly on the
     clitoris. For further comfort,
     you can fully adjust the clitoral stimulator to
     perfectly fit on your clitoris. Depending on your labia shape, it will
     almost or totally disappear between the labia
     lips for absolute discretion and pleasure. With very comfortable, ultra soft silicone used for the outer parts of Mara, you won't even know it's there
     until you turn it on. <p></p>

<b>Stimulating both partners during
     intercourse.</b> Thanks
     to <span>a superb design and super soft
     materials, you can just put it in the vagina either way around; </span><span>the larger
     vibrator placed directly on the clitoris
     and the smaller one in the vagina holding it in place
     during penetration. Share the sublime pleasures of Mara, the couples’
     massager that brings amazing sensations during lovemaking. Worn by
     women when making love, Mara offers
     completely new sensations for both partners. The smooth insertable
     tail is worn by the woman and affords ample space for both partners, while
     the larger top brings satisfying vibrations to the clitoris. With Mara in
     place, the possibility of a shared climax becomes a thrilling reality,
     time and time again…You can also choose to turn vaginal vibration on for
     more satisfaction for both partners. The vaginal
     vibrating function used during penetration is a mind-blowing new way to share
     intimacy. More pleasure for him and
     more pleasure for her, with unlimited possibilities for play - your love
     life will never be the same again!                                                         </span>Worn by men during intercourse, Mara delivers a fuller presence for
     breath-taking intensity along with satisfying vibrations for her to enjoy,
     culminating in a mind-blowing climax for both partners. When worn by men,
     both partner<span>s’ stimulation is only possible
     when practicing ""Seventy Nine"" sex position (check out the
     picture at the end). It can also
     be used for prostate massage.                       <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/997479/files/20141108173458-Mara_animacija_sredjena.jpg?1415496898"" src="""" style=""width: 211.366459627329px; height: 205px;""/> Mara pleasuring both partners during intercourse.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">.....................................................................................................................................</span></p></span>

<b>Play with your partner via <span>the Mara app or remote control
     from anywhere in the world.</span></b> <span>The Mara app has two user modes: visible
     and invisible. If you want to control the device
     with your phone in public places,
     you probably want to keep a low
     profile. In visible mode,
     you can see all the controls on the screen.
     The user interface is very simple
     with large buttons and all it takes is touch 'n' swipe. In invisible mode
     you get a black screen with all controls invisible. It's really easy to
     use after you have used visible mode a few
     times. Besides in bed, we and our volunteers just loved
     playing on the beach, while swimming and in public places like shops,
     restaurants, nightclubs and dinner parties.

<li>
<b>Music Activation.</b> You
     can pair Mara with your iPod, phone or any other music player and <span>it will replicate bass vibrations
     on your clitoris and vagina. It can
     also listen to the music and provide matching
     vibrations. In nightclubs,
     parties, on the beach or in your workplace. Mara vibrates and pulses
     to club music, concerts or to your lover’s voice. The mic is built into
     the wireless remote control and can be kept in a purse, in your hand or in
     someone else’s - adding to the extra excitement of not knowing what’s
     coming next. :)

<b>Smart design remote control.</b> Completely waterproof and small
     with all the buttons just in the right place. You can hold it in your hand
     or put it in your pocket. You don't have to reach in<span>to
     your pocket to control it. The Mara remote is designed
     in such a way that you
     can push the buttons from outside the
     pocket. We invested a great deal of funds and time into remote
     control development for Mara. Other manufacturers just don't pay
     enough attention to remotes,
     which in our opinion are one of the
     most important things for wearable couples vibrators. We did, and it works and looks
     perfect! We focused on building a simple
     and easy-to-use remote control for Mara.                    ....................................................................................................................................</span>

<li>
<b>Additional external On/Off button</b> placed on <span>a part

     a bikini or a skirt
     without taking them off. Push once
     and Mara turns on;
     push twice for Intelligent Vibration Mode; push
     three times in two seconds to power
     off. (3 times in 2 sec to avoid accidental shut down - you don't
     want that to happen :)  The button
     is virtually invisible to avoid any discomfort to your labia.                                                                                                     .................................................................................................................................... </span>

     send one for free to US &amp; Canada customers only.                                                                                                                             </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">..................................................................................................................................</span>

     them during the session to produce perfect vibration patterns made just

<b>Superb on low speed settings. </b>Thanks to <span style=""background-color: initial;"">the Haptic
     Drive we use, Mara delivers unprecedented sensations on slow movement modes. 72% of
     women prefer slower but more powerful movements on the clitoris. Mara is the very
     first vibrator that delivers that. If you are in the 28%
     of women who enjoy faster vibrations, Mara will easily deliver that too.                                                                                                                                                                                      ...............................................Technical info...........................................................      </span><br/>

The greatest advantage of this technology is its super powerful and long movements on low speed settings. Vibrations speeds of 5Hz - 18000HZ in 1% steps will reach and fulfill everyone's desires and exceed all expectations. Equipped with three independent Haptic Feedback drives, Mara is light years ahead of competition. Combined, they deliver a maximal vibration amplitude of 9.8G, which makes it the strongest vibrator ever made. Vaginal insert MVA 7.0G+1.4G and clitoral stimulator MVA 1.4G. Don't worry, you don't have to use all of that power.</span><br/>

We bought different kinds of sex toys which we used just  once or twice before they became boring. We thought that we were just the kind of people who simply got bored with toys really fast. But the problem wasn't in us. We just couldn't find the perfect toy which could satisfy us in the right way. We made a device which outperforms all other products we tested and decided to offer it to the world. We are sure that Mara will be a huge success on the market, and that it will force other manufacturers to better serve their consumers. </p><ul>
<li>After thousands of dollars spent on adult toys which don't work very well, we always talked about making the perfect toy to give us perfect pleasure and which we could use for a long time without getting bored with it.</li>
<li>Talking to our friends, we realized that nobody was completely satisfied with their sex toys. We concluded that the only sex toy which doesn't get boring for a couple, and the only one which perfectly delivers two way satisfaction, is wearable vibrators. And none of them worked well. We listened to dozens of our friends' experiences and decided to finally go with the project.</li>
<li>Both of us are engineers with years of experience in high tech industrial design. That's why we had more than enough technical knowledge for the decision to design Mara. </li>
<li>We were never a part of the sex toy industry. Some things are better seen from the outside. Adult toy industry designers are mostly boring engineers who lost touch with real world customers years ago, or never even had it in the first place. We just realized that the perfect toy for us wasn't on the market and when we saw how much new technology we could put into Mara, we definitely decided to make it forourselves and all  others who feel same way.  </li>
<li>Unfortunately, all of the technology that Mara has comes with a price. You can't expect to have a state-of-the-art, multi-functional, ultralight, supersafe, highquality device for small bucks. A real economical MSRP should be much more than $139, but we agreed to cut our profit percentages to a minimum, in order to make a great value device and gain good company promotion for the future. Indiegogo prices are slightly higher than the manufacturing price.</li>

<ul>
<li>So far, we have been entirely
     self-funded. Your pledge will help us finance manufacturing cost<span>s and the first
     round of production. We need your help to order
     equipment to start serial production and further app polishing. We will be
     ready to order tooling by the end of January. Some of the tools are
     already ordered. High tech product development is incredibly
     expensive. Please understand that we are a small company and we have already invested almost all
     of our money in this project. That's how strongly
     we believe in Mara and our other high-end adult toys prototypes and ideas.</span>
</li>
<li>We expect <span>the first
     units to be available in February and we will
     fulfill backer rewards with the first possible batch of products. Because
     it's not our first time designing
     and manufacturing a high tech product, and due the fact that we have already used our existing
     supply chain numerous times for our past business activities, we will
     surely avoid the delays and hurdles that often appear when entering
     production for the first time.</span>
</li>
<li>We <span>have been developing
     adult sex toys for over two years now (as of November
     2014) and, among four other
     prototypes, we chose Mara to be first device which we will offer the
     world. And we're sure we made the perfect choice.</span>
</li>
<li>Before creating<span> the final design for Mara, with the full assistance of
     our gynecologist friend who helped us design Mara's anatomical
     shape to perfectly fit and hold without causing any
     discomfort, we made and humantested
     over 80 different designs using our 3D printers, handmade molds, injected
     silicone casting and our own CNC machines.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/997458/files/20141108171823-Mara_timeline.jpg?1415495903"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

And it's equipped with a bass activation mode, perfect for use in nightclubs and parties. 10/10! Only on Indiegogo!""  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our philosophy while designing Mara was simple: we just wanted to create a device for couples which can really satisfy both of us and which doesn't get boring after one use. We managed to realize and solve all problems and weaknesses that other vibrators for couples on the market have.                                                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Mara is a strap-free,
     hands-free, truly wearable and really invisible
     couples vibrator.  So wearable and invisible - you can wear it under a bikini without anyone
     noticing. You can even swim with Mara - One of the
     greatest orgasms women experience happens in water :) Or you can join
     the Mile High Club and experience
     a seismic orgasm while flying.
     Solo or with your partner involved - no matter where he or she is at that
     moment, next to you or on another
     continent. Due to its anatomical shape, Mara will fit perfectly into your vagina,
     holding the clitoral part directly on the
     clitoris. For further comfort,
     you can fully adjust the clitoral stimulator to
     perfectly fit on your clitoris. Depending on your labia shape, it will
     almost or totally disappear between the labia
     lips for absolute discretion and pleasure. With very comfortable, ultra soft silicone used for the outer parts of Mara, you won't even know it's there
     until you turn it on. 
Mara under bikini. Truly invisible for 100% discretion.           ......................................................................................................................................


Stimulating both partners during
     intercourse. Thanks
     to a superb design and super soft
     materials, you can just put it in the vagina either way around; the larger
     vibrator placed directly on the clitoris
     and the smaller one in the vagina holding it in place
     during penetration. Share the sublime pleasures of Mara, the couples’
     massager that brings amazing sensations during lovemaking. Worn by
     women when making love, Mara offers
     completely new sensations for both partners. The smooth insertable
     tail is worn by the woman and affords ample space for both partners, while
     the larger top brings satisfying vibrations to the clitoris. With Mara in
     place, the possibility of a shared climax becomes a thrilling reality,
     time and time again…You can also choose to turn vaginal vibration on for
     more satisfaction for both partners. The vaginal
     vibrating function used during penetration is a mind-blowing new way to share
     intimacy. More pleasure for him and
     more pleasure for her, with unlimited possibilities for play - your love
     life will never be the same again!                                                         Worn by men during intercourse, Mara delivers a fuller presence for
     breath-taking intensity along with satisfying vibrations for her to enjoy,
     culminating in a mind-blowing climax for both partners. When worn by men,
     both partners’ stimulation is only possible
     when practicing ""Seventy Nine"" sex position (check out the
     picture at the end). It can also
     be used for prostate massage.                        Mara pleasuring both partners during intercourse.  .....................................................................................................................................


Play with your partner via the Mara app or remote control
     from anywhere in the world. The Mara app has two user modes: visible
     and invisible. If you want to control the device
     with your phone in public places,
     you probably want to keep a low
     profile. In visible mode,
     you can see all the controls on the screen.
     The user interface is very simple
     with large buttons and all it takes is touch 'n' swipe. In invisible mode
     you get a black screen with all controls invisible. It's really easy to
     use after you have used visible mode a few
     times. Besides in bed, we and our volunteers just loved
     playing on the beach, while swimming and in public places like shops,
     restaurants, nightclubs and dinner parties.
     .....................................................................................................................................


Music Activation. You
     can pair Mara with your iPod, phone or any other music player and it will replicate bass vibrations
     on your clitoris and vagina. It can
     also listen to the music and provide matching
     vibrations. In nightclubs,
     parties, on the beach or in your workplace. Mara vibrates and pulses
     to club music, concerts or to your lover’s voice. The mic is built into
     the wireless remote control and can be kept in a purse, in your hand or in
     someone else’s - adding to the extra excitement of not knowing what’s
     coming next. :)                
                        
        
     .....................................................................................................................................


Smart design remote control. Completely waterproof and small
     with all the buttons just in the right place. You can hold it in your hand
     or put it in your pocket. You don't have to reach into
     your pocket to control it. The Mara remote is designed
     in such a way that you
     can push the buttons from outside the
     pocket. We invested a great deal of funds and time into remote
     control development for Mara. Other manufacturers just don't pay
     enough attention to remotes,
     which in our opinion are one of the
     most important things for wearable couples vibrators. We did, and it works and looks
     perfect! We focused on building a simple
     and easy-to-use remote control for Mara.                    ....................................................................................................................................


Additional external On/Off button placed on a part
     of the Mara clitoral zone. For
     usage and control without the remote
     control or phone app. You can turn Mara on/off through pants,
     a bikini or a skirt
     without taking them off. Push once
     and Mara turns on;
     push twice for Intelligent Vibration Mode; push
     three times in two seconds to power
     off. (3 times in 2 sec to avoid accidental shut down - you don't
     want that to happen :)  The button
     is virtually invisible to avoid any discomfort to your labia.                                                                                                     .................................................................................................................................... 


Fully adjustable hands-free
     clitoral stimulator, which you can perfectly adjust
     for complete pleasure and full comfort. Maximum discretion and
     invisibility in all situations. The clitoral
     vibration drive is placed directly underneath the clitoral
     pads.     .....................................................................................................................................
      


G-spot stimulation in a vaginal insert. Vaginal
     vibration drives are placed to stimulate the G-spot
     directly. You can choose different vibration patterns separately for the G-spot and the clitoris. Additional
     vaginal inserts for Mara will be available after June 2015 and we will
     send one for free to US & Canada customers only.                                                                                                                             ..................................................................................................................................


Intelligent. Mara has the ability to record
     and replay any pattern, allowing you
     to have a completely personalized
     experience every time you use it. Mara constantly tracks your vibrating choices and memorizes
     them during the session to produce perfect vibration patterns made just
     for you. There is a separate button for
     intelligent vibration on the Mara
     app, or just push the external button on Mara twice to activate it.  
              
     ....................................................................................................................................


Superb on low speed settings. Thanks to the Haptic
     Drive we use, Mara delivers unprecedented sensations on slow movement modes. 72% of
     women prefer slower but more powerful movements on the clitoris. Mara is the very
     first vibrator that delivers that. If you are in the 28%
     of women who enjoy faster vibrations, Mara will easily deliver that too.                                                                                                                                                                                      ...............................................Technical info...........................................................      





The Haptic Drive that Mara uses  is the strongest and quietest ever made for this kind of device. The greatest advantage of this technology is its super powerful and long movements on low speed settings. Vibrations speeds of 5Hz - 18000HZ in 1% steps will reach and fulfill everyone's desires and exceed all expectations. Equipped with three independent Haptic Feedback drives, Mara is light years ahead of competition. Combined, they deliver a maximal vibration amplitude of 9.8G, which makes it the strongest vibrator ever made. Vaginal insert MVA 7.0G+1.4G and clitoral stimulator MVA 1.4G. Don't worry, you don't have to use all of that power.


Replicating human touch: It uses Haptic Feedback
      Technology which means that when you or someone else who controls Mara replicates real human touch you
      can immediately feel it in
      your bed (or in your panties). The Haptic
      Drive provides completely different
      vibrations than conventional motors used in old-fashioned
      vibrators. We took that advantage and programmed Mara with 10
      different vibration wave forms you can choose remotely. You can also
      choose between tactile and circular vibration modes at any time, as well as between different
      speeds and powers
      for vaginal and clitoral stimulation separately. Or choose to switch one
      of them off.

110% more power (Spinal Tap
       Scale: 11 )
340% greater sensation range
       compared to common vibrators on market
95% less noise               

The Direct
     Focused Vibrations featured in Mara’s
     design can be achieved only with new Haptic Drive Technology combined
     with two different kinds of silicone. Vibrations are directed and focused
     exactly to zones where they're needed. No numb body parts with Mara.                                                                                                                


 Mara is so powerful and long lasting, you can also use it for full body massage.       



Wireless charging. Mara comes with a very discreet plastic box for
     charging and storage. Lockable and child-safe. No one could tell what is
     inside. You charge Mara while it's locked inside.                                                                                                     ..............................................................................................................................................  Battery is a rechargeable
     Li-Ion with 2600 mAh capacity so it will last for 3-5
     hours or dozen of sessions without recharging (depending on speeds). Fully charged
     in under an hour, with 75% capacity charged in 15
     minutes. For complete discretion, we designed the box to look like an external HDD. In the
     package you get USB and 110/220v compatible
     cables for the Mara case.
     ............................................................................................................................................

Mara is completely silent: 23dB on the lowest
     speed setting to 34dB on the
     highest speed. Yes, that silent! That's because motors in Mara use
     electromagnetic resonance for movement,
     which is silent technology used in High-End medical devices.    
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                    
     ............................................................................................................................................. 


Full Magnetic Shielding. We can proudly say that Mara is the very
     first vibrator with a magnetic
     shield. You can put Mara close to credit cards or phones without
     damaging them. Also, it's much healthier for your body compared to
     vibrators without shielding.

Mara is made of super soft medical grade
     Class V Anti-Microbial silicone and a medical grade alloywhich
     is used for the internal parts to keep it
     ultra light weight, very strong and adjustable. 100% free of

Mara is strong in attitude and exquisite
     in versatility.                                                       Use it wisely – there’s no
     telling where it’ll take you.                                                 


Fully operational Mara prototypes in its production
     configuration have been tested for four months
     now by 52 volunteers,
     couples and individuals(age 21-68), with almost 100% positive
     feedback.

A vibrator must be as enjoyable for any couple as it is for a single person. It must bring a whole new level of joy and pleasure. If it doesn't do that - it doesn't work well.Until 2011, we never thought that we would be developing adult sex devices. We bought different kinds of sex toys which we used just  once or twice before they became boring. We thought that we were just the kind of people who simply got bored with toys really fast. But the problem wasn't in us. We just couldn't find the perfect toy which could satisfy us in the right way. We made a device which outperforms all other products we tested and decided to offer it to the world. We are sure that Mara will be a huge success on the market, and that it will force other manufacturers to better serve their consumers. 
After thousands of dollars spent on adult toys which don't work very well, we always talked about making the perfect toy to give us perfect pleasure and which we could use for a long time without getting bored with it.
Talking to our friends, we realized that nobody was completely satisfied with their sex toys. We concluded that the only sex toy which doesn't get boring for a couple, and the only one which perfectly delivers two way satisfaction, is wearable vibrators. And none of them worked well. We listened to dozens of our friends' experiences and decided to finally go with the project.
Both of us are engineers with years of experience in high tech industrial design. That's why we had more than enough technical knowledge for the decision to design Mara. 
We were never a part of the sex toy industry. Some things are better seen from the outside. Adult toy industry designers are mostly boring engineers who lost touch with real world customers years ago, or never even had it in the first place. We just realized that the perfect toy for us wasn't on the market and when we saw how much new technology we could put into Mara, we definitely decided to make it forourselves and all  others who feel same way.  
Unfortunately, all of the technology that Mara has comes with a price. You can't expect to have a state-of-the-art, multi-functional, ultralight, supersafe, highquality device for small bucks. A real economical MSRP should be much more than $139, but we agreed to cut our profit percentages to a minimum, in order to make a great value device and gain good company promotion for the future. Indiegogo prices are slightly higher than the manufacturing price.


So far, we have been entirely
     self-funded. Your pledge will help us finance manufacturing costs and the first
     round of production. We need your help to order
     equipment to start serial production and further app polishing. We will be
     ready to order tooling by the end of January. Some of the tools are
     already ordered. High tech product development is incredibly
     expensive. Please understand that we are a small company and we have already invested almost all
     of our money in this project. That's how strongly
     we believe in Mara and our other high-end adult toys prototypes and ideas.

We expect the first
     units to be available in February and we will
     fulfill backer rewards with the first possible batch of products. Because
     it's not our first time designing
     and manufacturing a high tech product, and due the fact that we have already used our existing
     supply chain numerous times for our past business activities, we will
     surely avoid the delays and hurdles that often appear when entering
     production for the first time.

We have been developing
     adult sex toys for over two years now (as of November
     2014) and, among four other
     prototypes, we chose Mara to be first device which we will offer the
     world. And we're sure we made the perfect choice.

Before creating the final design for Mara, with the full assistance of
     our gynecologist friend who helped us design Mara's anatomical
     shape to perfectly fit and hold without causing any
     discomfort, we made and humantested
     over 80 different designs using our 3D printers, handmade molds, injected
     silicone casting and our own CNC machines.


All people who back the Mara project will receive a
     special thank you note and a 30%
     discount on our next three
     soon-to-be-launched devices.

Our contributors can also become  beta testers in our future projects,
     three of them coming in 2015. Customers who are interested in writing detailed reviews and sending them back to us can get a
     test prototype of our devices in development. With 100% discretion
     guaranteed.
In mid 2015
     we will establish Mara production regardless of campaign success, and every contributor will get
     their reward in time.

We have 3 more different adult toys prototypes in the human testing phase and four
     more currently in the prototype design phase. At
     least three of them are expected to enter the market
     in 2015. 


Fully adjustable additional
     vaginal inserts for Mara will be available after June 2015 and we will
     send one of them free to US & Canada customers.
     Mara vaginal inserts will be 100% compatible with at least two of our
     future devices.

We will also produce a cheaper
     light version of Mara called Mara Lite with a wireless remote control, but without Mara App control
     and Music Activation. 

The Mara App will be available on
     the App Store and on Google Play in April 2015.
Patent pending.
Mara purchase transactions
     will appear on your credit card bill as ""MSFF"".
 

Mara comes with a
     2 year warranty and a 4 year quality guarantee.

comes from diet, but a good portion also comes from the sun. And according to
the Mayo Clinic, as little as 10 minutes of sun exposure can provide us with
our daily dose. According to the vitamin D council, ""your body can produce
10,000 to 25,000 IU of vitamin D in just a little under the time it takes for

Not only are you stimulating nerve endings when you walk on the sand,

author of Earthing: The Most Important Health Discovery Ever? You may be better
connected to the earth when you ditch your shoes, reaping vital mood-boosting

<p>Thanks for checking out Totem eyewear. We’ve received a ton of support getting this far and we’re really excited to finally share all of our hard work with everyone. </p>
<p><span>Frustrated with being unable to find good sunglasses that were affordable and high quality I </span><span>had to choose between cheap plastic sunglasses that don't really protect my eyes, or designer sunglasses that are really expensive.                                                                                                          </span>we started thinking that there has to be a better way.                                                                   so last summer keren and I started talking about designing our on sunglasses we felt there are 3 things that needed to be address:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Good design</span></li>
<li><span>High quality </span></li>
<li><span>Price that everybody can afford</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Since then, we spent a long time testing and fine tuning our sunglasses to come up with high quality polarized sunglasses collection that we know everyone will love. </span></p>

Thanks for checking out Totem eyewear. We’ve received a ton of support getting this far and we’re really excited to finally share all of our hard work with everyone. 
Frustrated with being unable to find good sunglasses that were affordable and high quality I had to choose between cheap plastic sunglasses that don't really protect my eyes, or designer sunglasses that are really expensive.                                                                                                          we started thinking that there has to be a better way.                                                                   so last summer keren and I started talking about designing our on sunglasses we felt there are 3 things that needed to be address:

Good design
High quality 
Price that everybody can afford

Since then, we spent a long time testing and fine tuning our sunglasses to come up with high quality polarized sunglasses collection that we know everyone will love. 
 


 
The Lens
Feature polycarbonate polarized film core with two uv filters that protects 100% of both UVA and UVB rays up to 400 nanometers and on top of that a scratch resistant coating that helps protect your lens and gives it durability.    

The Frame
Totem has a classic frame with a modern twist. it is special made out of memory polymer which is extremely durable and light weight material. The frame can be put under a lot of pressure and still get back to its original shape without bending or breaking.

<p><b>My Story:</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My name is Kristy Smith and my passion for fashion and the love of the beach drove me to pursue my design career in Southern California 14 years ago.  The pursuit of my dream to become a leading designer in the fashion industry has fueled my drive to achieve this goal.  </span><br/></p>
<p>Why should you believe in me?<br/></p>
<p>I have a sexy and ultra chic style that derives from my impeccable taste for high fashion and intuitive designer instinct for cutting edge trends. My sense of personal style is always complimented and attracts people all ages.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442376842/pjfhudloutzsv127nina.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What sets me apart from other designers?<br/></p>
<p>My creative mind is constantly exploding with new &amp; innovative ideas for fashion and I am always on the search to design something more exciting than the last thing I saw.  My drive to be a forerunner in fashion empowers my creativity.</p>
<p>Why should you buy Dolce Aqua Swimwear over other swimwear?<br/></p>
<p>On the forefront of fashion, Dolce Aqua Swimwear has a vision of cutting edge style, sexy silhouettes, perfect curve accentuating cuts, exquisite detailing, a stunning color palette, impeccable construction and a feeling of luxury that will attract every fashion savvy woman.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It is our mission to deliver “head turning fashion” season after season and to be the most sought after fashion forward swimwear brand in the market.  Our high standards of quality will deliver superior products with impeccable fits made from high quality imported Italian fabrics and exquisite trims.  Manufacturing Dolce Aqua Swimwear in Los Angeles allows us to closely monitor the quality of our products and deliver our products on time.</span><br/></p>

<p>Why Dolce Aqua Swimwear is ready for success?<br/></p>
<p>As an experienced designer in the industry I have built a team of top quality industry professionals who are ready to work together to make Dolce Aqua Swimwear run smoothly.  I stand behind our exceptional quality and consistency in work.</p>
<p>How did Dolce Aqua Swimwear begin?<br/></p>
<p>Never fully satisfied with the contemporary swimwear out there I knew I could design a line that really stood out above the rest.</p>
<p>I sourced the best Italian fabrics, French laces, developed unique trims and hardware to create the most luxurious swimsuits.</p>
<p>The name, “Dolce Aqua,”  my translation “Sweet Water” derives from the Italian expression, Dolce Vita or Sweet life, life of luxury perfectly encompasses the vibe of my swimwear line.  </p>

My Story:My name is Kristy Smith and my passion for fashion and the love of the beach drove me to pursue my design career in Southern California 14 years ago.  The pursuit of my dream to become a leading designer in the fashion industry has fueled my drive to achieve this goal.  
Why should you believe in me?
I have a sexy and ultra chic style that derives from my impeccable taste for high fashion and intuitive designer instinct for cutting edge trends. My sense of personal style is always complimented and attracts people all ages.  


What sets me apart from other designers?
My creative mind is constantly exploding with new & innovative ideas for fashion and I am always on the search to design something more exciting than the last thing I saw.  My drive to be a forerunner in fashion empowers my creativity.
Why should you buy Dolce Aqua Swimwear over other swimwear?
On the forefront of fashion, Dolce Aqua Swimwear has a vision of cutting edge style, sexy silhouettes, perfect curve accentuating cuts, exquisite detailing, a stunning color palette, impeccable construction and a feeling of luxury that will attract every fashion savvy woman.
It is our mission to deliver “head turning fashion” season after season and to be the most sought after fashion forward swimwear brand in the market.  Our high standards of quality will deliver superior products with impeccable fits made from high quality imported Italian fabrics and exquisite trims.  Manufacturing Dolce Aqua Swimwear in Los Angeles allows us to closely monitor the quality of our products and deliver our products on time.



Why Dolce Aqua Swimwear is ready for success?
As an experienced designer in the industry I have built a team of top quality industry professionals who are ready to work together to make Dolce Aqua Swimwear run smoothly.  I stand behind our exceptional quality and consistency in work.
How did Dolce Aqua Swimwear begin?
Never fully satisfied with the contemporary swimwear out there I knew I could design a line that really stood out above the rest.
I sourced the best Italian fabrics, French laces, developed unique trims and hardware to create the most luxurious swimsuits.
The name, “Dolce Aqua,”  my translation “Sweet Water” derives from the Italian expression, Dolce Vita or Sweet life, life of luxury perfectly encompasses the vibe of my swimwear line.  


Why Indiegogo?
I am taking financial matters into my own hands after having joined several business ventures where my partners did follow through with their agreements to provide the necessary business funding to produce Dolce Aqua Swimwear. 


$10,000 Production Cost Break down:




1.  Fabric Cost: $4,297.00Importing fabric from Italy includes shipping, duties, and custom fees.2. Pre-Production cost: $3905.00Pre-production costs include: production patterns, production fit samples, fit model fees, grading, marking, cutting, and trim send outs. 3. Production cost: $1798.00Production costs include garment trims (bra cups, elastics, hardware, etc) and sewing. Note: All costs are an estimate and will fluctuate based on the # of orders.TOTAL DOLCE AQUA MINI COLLECTION COST:  $10,000.00
Although my immediate goal is $10,000 to fund this mini collection production. I hope to exceed this goal and to use the extra money funded to cover:  
The shipping costs of the swimsuits.

The Indiegogo fees.
The Amazon payment processing fees.

Production of additional suits to sell on dolceaquaswimwear.com and to local retailers. 

Funding for marketing, social media, PR, website upkeep, etc.
The development of a new collection!

Esta es la campaña de ampliación de IRON BATTLEFIELD. Aquí encontrarás el material adicional que fue regalado en la campaña principal.

These accessories are MDF, plastic, and cardboard lasercutted pieces, and polyurethane resin cast. You can find more information about this in the main campaign.
Estos accesorios están realizados en DM, plástico y cartón cortado a láser, además de piezas obtenidas en resina de poliuretano. Podrás encontrar más información en la campaña principal.

As well as the IRON BATTLEFIELD campaign, we keep our goals policy: if the campaign gets a goal, backers will get additional stuff!! each perk explains its own rewards.
Al igual que en la campaña de IRON BATTLEFIELD, mantenemos nuestra política de regalos: Si la campaña alcanza una meta, ¡¡los contribuyentes conseguirán material adicional!! cada contribución (perk) explica sus propios regalos.

This campaign will be 33 days running. All the pieces are designed, and will be sent with your IRON BATTLEFIELD order (if you are a backer of this campaign). Although it is subjet to further delay, shipping will start in late February surely.

Come along on this literary joyride of the Berlin that is just beneath the surface and has always been so expertly hidden. Until now...<br/><br/>Enter this world as I claw my way through the city of the moment: Berlin. The unfathomable, imagined. A place of no rules, and no boundaries. A city where there is no sexual divide. Metrosexual, bisexual, yes. Gay or straight?<br/><br/>Not a chance.<br/><br/>In a city where every language is spoken, there is only one that transcends them all. Everyone speaks heaux…</p>
<p><br/> How fab is your heauxcabulary?   </p>
<p>Whatever the setting, there is always a story to tell. From the erotic to the exotic, to the raw and heartfelt, every aspect of life is covered with a touch of cynicism and caustic wit. Every heaux has a story to tell. This is mine. Join me on a wild and raucous ride, if you dare.<br/> <br/>From the drama onstage and off, with the backdrop of a city like no other – Berlin, the characters take you on a never-ending, spiraling adventure. A city in the midst of change filled with artists ready to change it. This is the second wave of neo-Berlin currently gritting it out on the toughest streets in central Europe. This is the place where dreams come true, or burn by the wayside. These are the stories of those select few doing the damn thing, and paying their dues on the way. There is never an easy way out. And in Berlin, even the ones that break through get a little dirty.  <br/> <br/>It’s <em>Fame</em> with an edge. <br/>It’s <em>Survivor</em>, because only the strong manage to get through the drama of it all. There will be casualties. <br/>It’s <em>Rent</em> for the new millennium. <br/>It’s <em>Sex &amp; The City</em>, on a real budget.  <br/> Welcome to <em>Heaux Confessionals</em>©.  Sho(r)t stories featuring tales of trickery, lust connections, love profusions and the daily grind that can be most unkind.</p>

This pulp friction literary barrage will leave no one unscathed. Come along on this literary joyride of the Berlin that is just beneath the surface and has always been so expertly hidden. Until now...Enter this world as I claw my way through the city of the moment: Berlin. The unfathomable, imagined. A place of no rules, and no boundaries. A city where there is no sexual divide. Metrosexual, bisexual, yes. Gay or straight?Not a chance.In a city where every language is spoken, there is only one that transcends them all. Everyone speaks heaux…
 How fab is your heauxcabulary?   
Whatever the setting, there is always a story to tell. From the erotic to the exotic, to the raw and heartfelt, every aspect of life is covered with a touch of cynicism and caustic wit. Every heaux has a story to tell. This is mine. Join me on a wild and raucous ride, if you dare. From the drama onstage and off, with the backdrop of a city like no other – Berlin, the characters take you on a never-ending, spiraling adventure. A city in the midst of change filled with artists ready to change it. This is the second wave of neo-Berlin currently gritting it out on the toughest streets in central Europe. This is the place where dreams come true, or burn by the wayside. These are the stories of those select few doing the damn thing, and paying their dues on the way. There is never an easy way out. And in Berlin, even the ones that break through get a little dirty.   It’s Fame with an edge. It’s Survivor, because only the strong manage to get through the drama of it all. There will be casualties. It’s Rent for the new millennium. It’s Sex & The City, on a real budget.   Welcome to Heaux Confessionals©.  Sho(r)t stories featuring tales of trickery, lust connections, love profusions and the daily grind that can be most unkind.
 Enter New Berlin.
 Enter Heaux Confessionals©.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Speakr brand smartwatch has the functionality of a computer remote. The main function of our watches is to sync with you Android/iPhone via bluetooth. When it is synced with your smartphone, it will allow your push notifications (ie text, incoming call, email, twitter message, Facebook, Linkedin etc) to be available on the smartwatch. Using the touchscreen display on the smartwatch, you can retrieve your messages, accept or decline a call, answer a call, make a call, screen calls with the caller ID. The Speakr smartwatch is the perfect smartphone companion. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To be able to release this product by January 2014, we need funding not only to go into production, but to continue to develop new software and designs so that our watches have more options available. We need funding for outsourcing so that we can remain at competitive pricing to keep our smart watches under $200 USD. To any one who is able to pledge $25 will get a 20% discount on the product when it releases. For those who can give $100 will get the design based on our prototype that will retail for $150. For those who pledge $150 will get a complimentary MK530 ""Articulate Style"" series Speakr smartwatch for your support. This design will retail for $200. Your contributions will help to pay for storefront location, software/app developers, travel expenses to factory, mass production, video and print advertising, reviews and more designs.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We know that the market for smartwatches is huge and growing. It is projected to become a billion dollar industry. As it stands right now, the smart watches that are out prices start at an average $300. In most cases the watch costs more than the smartphone. We don't want our smartwatches to cost more than then the phone, after all, the smartwatch is accessory so it should be affordable. So to keep the cost of manufacturing down so that the retail price can stay low, we intend to outsource. We will remove any features and functions that are not neccessary or needed to keep the costs low.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to give but cannot, its okay. Help promote this product, get the word out. Anything helps and will be greatly appreciated.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<p>Rave Smart was founded in late 2014 by me (Stacy Gomez) and my wife (Samantha Gomez), in response to seeing ravers young and old alike practicing unsafe drug use. These unsafe practices are putting the scene, and more importantly people’s lives in danger. We are designed to provide harm reduction information and affordable adulterant screening kits to the local rave and nightlife scene. </p>
<p>We at Rave Smart do not condone or condemn drug use and believe that drug use is inherently dangerous; however we know that some people will still choose to use drugs and we want to spread knowledge, factual information, and harm reduction practices to help reduce these risks as much as possible.</p>
<p>Help us reach out in our community, reduce unsafe behavior, maintain a fun and safe environment, educate each other, and maybe even save some lives!</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Rave Smart has been in operation since November of 2014 and so far we have spent well over $1,500 out of our own pockets to get drug safety and harm reduction information out to the people who need it most. We are running out of funds and we need your help! We are setting a goal of $3,000. With this money we will be able to have more fliers and harm reduction pamphlets made and printed, get our website built and operational, and most importantly we will get more drug reagent kits made and out to the people who need them! With this money we will be able to get our message of safe and responsible drug use out to more people and that means more peoples lives will be saved because of your donations!</p>
