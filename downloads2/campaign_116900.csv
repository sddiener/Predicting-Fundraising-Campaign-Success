<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We have nearly finished writing our book on how to find love in abundance!</p>
<p>Over the last twenty years, we have lived a polyamorous life.

<h3>Topics</h3>
<p>Find out all the in's and out's of online dating; polyamory specific sites for dating; real time dating tips and tricks; where to meet people; how to create a profile that gets attention (and how to keep attention once someone notices you); pandemic dating; dating for an introvert; and lots more! </p>
<p>Plus what is the truth about dating if you are already an existing couple? Can it work? Should it be discouraged? Or can it be done ethically and as a positive for all involved? </p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>Black Excellence: Journeys of Success</i> stems from one man’s exploration into what excellence is and how to achieve it. <i>Black Excellence</i> contains the results of interviews with dozens of African American professionals who have demonstrated excellence in their lives and careers.</p>
<p>My name is Lynnewood Jeff Shafer II, and I am the author of <i>Black Excellence: Journeys of Success</i>. I wrote this work because I wanted to share stories of success within the black community to help institutionalize the wisdom of current and previous generations so future ones can go even further. </p>
<p>I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover practical insights on how to be more effective in your personal journey of excellence. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same passion and excitement that I have for excellence (continual growth and development). Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you execute on things you considered impossible.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn how to become a student of life and methods for developing confidence and dealing with impostor syndrome. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>How a woman who taught herself to code as a young girl while growing up in Nigeria during the Boko Haram regime, with occasional help from someone from India that she met online, grew up to become a serial entrepreneur and franchisor.</li>
<li>How an intelligent, former wall street banker with degrees from Yale and Harvard Business School developed and battled Impostor Syndrome.</li>
<li>How a man survived the Rwandan Genocide as a child to become an ivy league educated, corporate attorney.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are committed to self-improvement, believe that it is wise to learn from others’ experiences, or if you love celebrating black success.  </p>
<p><i>Black Excellence: Journeys of Success</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to the tired, the hungry, and those ready for change. <i>Black Excellence</i> offers inspiration and motivation through a black lens.</p>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Black Excellence: Journeys of Success stems from one man’s exploration into what excellence is and how to achieve it. Black Excellence contains the results of interviews with dozens of African American professionals who have demonstrated excellence in their lives and careers.
My name is Lynnewood Jeff Shafer II, and I am the author of Black Excellence: Journeys of Success. I wrote this work because I wanted to share stories of success within the black community to help institutionalize the wisdom of current and previous generations so future ones can go even further. 
I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover practical insights on how to be more effective in your personal journey of excellence. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same passion and excitement that I have for excellence (continual growth and development). Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you execute on things you considered impossible.
In this book, you'll learn how to become a student of life and methods for developing confidence and dealing with impostor syndrome. You'll hear stories such as...

How a woman who taught herself to code as a young girl while growing up in Nigeria during the Boko Haram regime, with occasional help from someone from India that she met online, grew up to become a serial entrepreneur and franchisor.
How an intelligent, former wall street banker with degrees from Yale and Harvard Business School developed and battled Impostor Syndrome.
How a man survived the Rwandan Genocide as a child to become an ivy league educated, corporate attorney.

You will love this book if you are committed to self-improvement, believe that it is wise to learn from others’ experiences, or if you love celebrating black success.  
Black Excellence: Journeys of Success is a nonfiction book that speaks to the tired, the hungry, and those ready for change. Black Excellence offers inspiration and motivation through a black lens.

About the Author
Lynnewood Jeff Shafer II is a JD Candidate at the University of Pennsylvania and MBA Candidate at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. Prior to graduate school, Jeff worked as a CPA at PwC, a professional services firm, for six years.
Jeff wrote this book because the tragic death of Kobe Bryant at 41 years old, in combination with the challenges experienced in 2020 and earlier, impressed upon him the brevity of life and the importance of taking action now. Given the uncertainty of life, as Jeff and his wife prepare to welcome their first child into the world this summer 2021, Jeff wanted a book of practical life lessons that he could give to his son. Jeff considers Black Excellence to be required reading for his son and believes if we practice the insights contained within, anyone can experience improved performance in their lives. 
Jeff is a huge NBA fan and has retired from GOAT (greatest of all time) debates, since Michael Jordan is the GOAT.  Jeff and his wife are fans of great restaurant suggestions. They love traveling to exotic locations and look forward to going on their next adventure!

From “what do you want to be when you grow up” in childhood to “what is your purpose in life” in adulthood, there is so much pressure to attain something, when the best part of life is the journey and the “whos” and “hows” along the way. I want to share stories of successful individuals who were adaptable in their purpose and empower others to be adaptable, too, as I have over the last two years.<br/><br/>My name is Rebecca Beagan and I am the author of Emergent Lives: How to Positively Disrupt Your Life. I wrote this book because I started noticing a pattern in conversations with friends, family, and colleagues. The theme was a feeling of discomfort in not knowing what they wanted to do in life (which often is thought to equate to who one wants to be or their life purpose). The more I thought about this, the more I heard it. At the same time, I heard from and read about highly successful people who took a different outlook, embracing change and emergence in their life. I think we all need to take the pressure “to become” off of ourselves and rather embrace the ride.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover ideas for how to navigate uncertainty and to proactively and positively disrupt your life whenever you want to do so. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for experimenting my way through life in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool by providing a collection of frameworks and tactics to try at any time, by yourself or with a group. to navigate life a little differently.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about individuals and companies that have experienced change, tragedy, and opportunity, and how they chose to move forward. A couple examples from the book include:</p><ul>
<li>Katharine Graham - How Mrs. Graham navigated deep tragedy and insecurity and was recognized as a major influencer in American journalism and politics in the late 1900s.</li>
<li>Michelle Obama - How Mrs. Obama navigated personal discovery and disruption and is a beloved First Lady of the United States who launched an important campaign to fight child obesity</li>

The second part of the book uses stories to bring to life when vision goes wrong, when lack of vision goes right, and when vision emerges.

The third part synthesizes takeaways from the stories in part 2 and then provides frameworks and tactics for groups and individuals to use to navigate life differently than setting a vision.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 10-12.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>A Return to the Ashes tells the story of several characters whose paths cross at different points in time, some belonging to royal families, others belonging to poor commonfolk. These relationships are only further complicated by a cult created by the survivors of a burnt-down village, who look to subvert these power structures in a way that puts the authority back in their hands.</p>
<p>Fifteen years prior, a balaur burnt down a village in the mountains. After the survivors were rejected by every nearby kingdom, whether out of the monarchs’ coldheartedness or lack of resources, these refugees determined to take things into their own hands, building up their own nomadic group called “The Phoenix,” led by Lumina, a survivor who’d watched her close friends die and adopted their daughter, Citrina. Through years of recruiting street orphans and training up their people to be highly-skilled spies and assassins, they’ve found ways to stay invisible, a whisper in the wind believed by most to be a wives’ tale.</p>
<p>When Citrina, now one of the top assassins in the organization, catches the eye of a high-ranking officer in a kingdom, they see it as the opportunity of a lifetime to finally begin to root their power — but things get complicated after a run-in with the King.</p>
<p>In other lands, arranged marriages and festivals begin to take place — great causes for celebration that enthrall all involved, but force the characters to wonder if they’re really headed in the directions they want to go.</p>
<p>My name is Nadina Popoviciu and I am the author of A Return to the Ashes. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore moral questions, especially regarding the nuances of where true power lies, as well as when to use it. I wanted to use a genre I’ve always loved — fantasy — combined with inspiration from the stories and history of the home country that’ll always hold a piece of my heart — Romania.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover in what ways people can find power and ways to influence others through means that aren’t necessarily political. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to explore the question of the moral way to use that, while relating to flawed characters that have to come to terms with what that means for their personal life.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy medieval fantasy, moral questions, and a mix of action and romance. A Return to the Ashes speaks to younger and older adults who want to grapple with moral boundaries, power structures, and how relationships fit into that, in a new way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that A Return to the Ashes inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like: How can I use the power I have within me in a moral manner? How does the conflict between interpersonal relationships and perceived purpose shift along differing viewpoints? Most importantly, how can we use these themes to create a social culture that is rooted in and focused on morality over power plays? I look forward to starting to explore these questions and beyond with my readers, as I believe these kinds of discussions can open our minds and change us all for the better.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.</p>
<p>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

A Return to the Ashes tells the story of several characters whose paths cross at different points in time, some belonging to royal families, others belonging to poor commonfolk. These relationships are only further complicated by a cult created by the survivors of a burnt-down village, who look to subvert these power structures in a way that puts the authority back in their hands.
Fifteen years prior, a balaur burnt down a village in the mountains. After the survivors were rejected by every nearby kingdom, whether out of the monarchs’ coldheartedness or lack of resources, these refugees determined to take things into their own hands, building up their own nomadic group called “The Phoenix,” led by Lumina, a survivor who’d watched her close friends die and adopted their daughter, Citrina. Through years of recruiting street orphans and training up their people to be highly-skilled spies and assassins, they’ve found ways to stay invisible, a whisper in the wind believed by most to be a wives’ tale.
When Citrina, now one of the top assassins in the organization, catches the eye of a high-ranking officer in a kingdom, they see it as the opportunity of a lifetime to finally begin to root their power — but things get complicated after a run-in with the King.
In other lands, arranged marriages and festivals begin to take place — great causes for celebration that enthrall all involved, but force the characters to wonder if they’re really headed in the directions they want to go.
My name is Nadina Popoviciu and I am the author of A Return to the Ashes. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore moral questions, especially regarding the nuances of where true power lies, as well as when to use it. I wanted to use a genre I’ve always loved — fantasy — combined with inspiration from the stories and history of the home country that’ll always hold a piece of my heart — Romania.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover in what ways people can find power and ways to influence others through means that aren’t necessarily political. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to explore the question of the moral way to use that, while relating to flawed characters that have to come to terms with what that means for their personal life.
You will love this book if you enjoy medieval fantasy, moral questions, and a mix of action and romance. A Return to the Ashes speaks to younger and older adults who want to grapple with moral boundaries, power structures, and how relationships fit into that, in a new way.
Ultimately, I hope that A Return to the Ashes inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like: How can I use the power I have within me in a moral manner? How does the conflict between interpersonal relationships and perceived purpose shift along differing viewpoints? Most importantly, how can we use these themes to create a social culture that is rooted in and focused on morality over power plays? I look forward to starting to explore these questions and beyond with my readers, as I believe these kinds of discussions can open our minds and change us all for the better.
 

What We Need & What You Get

The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring

When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.

About the Author
Nadina Popoviciu is a Romanian-American student studying Statistics and Decision Science at Carnegie Mellon University. She has been creatively writing for over ten years, and has integrated the mix of Romanian and American culture and values that she grew up with to question the world around her and find meaningful ways to connect with others.She is passionate about people over anything else, and how we can best improve ourselves as well as our community and world. For almost a decade she’s stated that she’ll have been successful if she’s managed to create more love in the world than there was when she entered it — through shifting perspectives and underlying philosophical themes, she hopes to create the conversations needed to create that sort of understanding among one another, with the aim of using that understanding to help each other when it’s needed and recognize the humanity of those who are different from us.When she’s not studying or writing, she loves spending time playing games or joking around with friends, bouldering and working out, or traveling (during non-COVID times)!For more information, you can connect with Nadina at npopovic@andrew.cmu.edu and at @nadinapopoviciu on Instagram, or Nadina Popoviciu on LinkedIn.

<h3><strong>What is Anatomic Air Press?</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://nuonis.com/category/anatomic-air-press/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anatomic Air Press</a> was created in 2002 by me, Sinoun Chea, to showcase my creative efforts and collaboration with others.

I have too many ideas in my notebook ready to be executed and produced. Creating things take time and money, something I currently have little of. But this lack of money and time is not permanent and will change, especially with your help and support!</p>
<h3><strong>What am I doing?</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>What is this book/zine?</strong></h3>
<p>In 2007, Celso and I made a book called ""Free"" (except the title is actually ""Free"" in Cambodian, cover is shown above). Celso did the artwork and I did the writing. There are a few things written in Cambodian in it, but don't worry, it's translated. :) <a href=""http://nuonis.com/free/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read reviews about the book here.</a> It was one of my favorite projects to share to the world and I sold the first 100 copies that I handmade in 2007-2008 pretty quickly. Celso handmade 200 copies for himself and they are pretty much gone on his end as well. Celso did a linocut for the cover and he sent me 200 covers to bind with the book. I have 100 of them left. Celso lost the linocut so we probably won't be reprinting this book any more in the future!</p>
<h3><strong>Why am I doing this?</strong></h3>
<p>Now that I'm ready to get the last 100 copies reprinted and made, I decided to actually ask for help this time. Your help will go a <em><strong>long</strong></em> way.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nuonis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/4.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>In the beginning, Celso and I sold the books for $5 or less. That was a ridiculous steal. You're probably wondering now why the hell am I asking for $25 a book?! I'll tell you why. First, the book is HANDMADE. Yes, I take it to the print shop to make copies, but I cut each sheet and bind the book myself. The book is 5"" x 5"" and has 56 pages. Some of the pages are ""fold-outs"" so it involves taping some of the pages. Don't forget that Celso block printed each cover! It's a lot of work, but we put a lot of love into it. We probably spend an average of 15-30 minutes printing and binding each book. This does not include the actual printing and shipping costs! <strong>The book is a true labor of love. </strong>With the money I'm raising by selling the book here on IndieGoGo, <strong>I'm going to put it towards future projects of Anatomic Air Press!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why should you support Anatomic Air Press?</strong></h3>
<p>I like to make things. It's fun. And I think you may enjoy some of the things I make. There are a lot of great ideas waiting to be produced. Your support will help me produce these projects faster and it will help me continue my future collaborative efforts with others.

<p>Because I want to inspire as many people as I can around the world with imaginative stories.

<h3>The Haven Series</h3>
<p> Haven is the first book in a series of three. I came up with the idea for the series over a year ago and have been working on it ever since. Now having finished the story of the first book, I will need a way to get it out to everybody and begin working on the second book. </p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Demas James Huckaba. I'm 18, a small town dreamer, and was born and raised here in the United States. I love writing, drawing, and I'm also a 1st Degree Black Belt in Taekwondo. Sci-fi stories and ideas always fascinate and inspire me.</li>
<li>My campaign is to bring an idea I have to the pages of a book for everyone. The first book is about three friends that have just graduated bootcamp and sign up so go to another planet in another dimension.

<li>Contributing is greatly helpful and much appreciated. Every contribution helps take the world of Haven a step futher. The more money we get the more we will be able to do. Every contribution will get us a step closer to getting this book out for everyone to read. If more than the goal amount is achieved then we'll produce different editions and start on other Haven projects including the second book and possibly a professionally done art book illustrating the world for you. Also, the money will be used to have the book edited by a professional. There are so many possibilites and it will mostly be decided by the contributers. Once the goal is reached I will start discussions with you as a whole and see what you want to see next.</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've made an esitmate of $5,000. This would get me about 450 paperback copies of Haven and leave enough money to ship rewards to my contributers. All of the money will go to the book but if enough is raised I'll have to use a little for living expenses. My laptop is all I had to write and it has crashed. So if enough money is earned I would get me a desktop computer to keep writing and creating new content for you. All that I can do is soley based on how much is contributed.</p>
<p>I've made 8 total perks for contributers. Ranging from a thank you card to 5 signed books, all printed and signed pieces of concept art, a thank you note, and a signed hardback special edition of the book along with a phone call from the author. </p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my entire goal, all the funds will still go to the book and making it a better experience for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As already explained, every contribution will make a difference but why should you contribute? This book is a completely original idea from the author and if you contribute then it is because of you that this book will be able to get out into the world. Another world will be able to open up into ours.</p>

</div></div>","The Haven Series
 Haven is the first book in a series of three. I came up with the idea for the series over a year ago and have been working on it ever since. Now having finished the story of the first book, I will need a way to get it out to everybody and begin working on the second book. 

My name is Demas James Huckaba. I'm 18, a small town dreamer, and was born and raised here in the United States. I love writing, drawing, and I'm also a 1st Degree Black Belt in Taekwondo. Sci-fi stories and ideas always fascinate and inspire me.
My campaign is to bring an idea I have to the pages of a book for everyone. The first book is about three friends that have just graduated bootcamp and sign up so go to another planet in another dimension. The planet is accessible through a portal that scientist on Earth opened not knowing that, without the right means, the portal has to stay open for five years. This world is very hostile. It is crawling with creatures that are called Prisoners that are constantly trying to kill and escape out onto Earth. They are called Prisoners because of the shackles and broken chains on them. To prevent the creatures from going to Earth a military installation was built around the portal on the otherside. The three friends, Damien, Jd, and Peter, are sent on missions to learn more about this planet and possibly discover a end to the war to keep these monsterous creatures inside this dimension. It's the first book of a three part series. It has loads of humor, action, and a bit of romance.

<h3>8 years and going strong!<br/>
</h3>The Denver Zine Library (DZL) first opened its doors on December 5, 2003 thanks to the hard work of some dedicated volunteers. Since then, the DZL has moved locations a few times and is now housed in the incredible 27 Social Centre. We are an all-volunteer run, 501(c)(3) nonprofit lending library with over 10,000 donated and cataloged zines on our shelves! We've been grateful for the amazing support over the years from zinesters, community members and rad touring folks who have come through and really promoted the power and importance of zines. Read more about the <a href=""http://denverzinelibrary.org/2010/08/20/history-of-the-denver-zine-library/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">DZL's history</a>!<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The power of zines<br/>
</h3>
<p>Over the years, the Denver Zine Library has hosted events and workshops, teaching youth, students and community members how to give power to their own voices. When so many of us do not see ourselves reflected in mainstream media, zines give us the ability to tell our own stories and to personally connect with other people. This connection is what makes this medium so exciting! We can find folks who share our experiences and our interests.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need your financial support to help maintain the DZL as well as give us the ability to plan the next Denver Zine Fest! The Denver Zine Fest has brought together local zinesters, artists, poets as well as folks from around the country to showcase, sell and trade their zines.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The DZL is asking for your financial support to maintain and expand what
 we can offer our community, both in the Denver area as well as the zine
 community at large. Sponsor a zine workshop (at community centers, libraries and classrooms) for $50. Cover the cost of one month's rent for $100. Help us raise at least $500 towards the planning of the next Denver Zine Fest! Spread the word to your friends and pen pals!</p>

<p>My background is admittedly very eclectic.  I am a US Army Infantry veteran diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder.  My professional history includes some nonprofit work with developmentally disabled adults, several years of audio engineering and sound reinforcement, eight years as an executive recruiter working with some of the most well-known names in the corporate world like Google, Yahoo!, Alcoa, Wal-Mart, Goodyear, Chanel, and General Mills, and since the economic meltdown of 2008, I've been working for myself - first opening a handyman business, simultaneously performing as a singer/songwriter playing solo acoustic shows around Houston, and then starting up a healthy vending business with my then-fiancee'.  I would like to start a nonprofit organization at some point but want to start writing this book whilst all the experiences of the last year and a half are rather fresh in my memory.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, my life was turned upside down by a woman.  She was the love of my life, my very first girlfriend in high school - she was four years older than I, and we naturally went our separate ways when she headed off to college and I was still stuck dealing with acne and how to skip Biology and smoke pot in the parking lot without being caught.  But in the middle of 2010, we reconnected via that modern marvel of cat videos and culinary photography, Facebook.  She was moving back to Texas and wouldn't it be great to get together?</p>

<p>From a voluntary inpatient stay at the VA hospital mental health ward, to multiple jobs being plucked out from under me by shady small businessmen and unscrupulous shysters, from a mysterious car accident that is to this day unexplainable, to dealing with a family who not only doesn't understand mental illness but is always ready to assume the worst of people, from the emotional rollercoaster of constant adjustments to psychotropic medications and dosages, to humorous interactions with possible love interests who have no idea what kind of special hell I'm going through, it has been a long, strange, sometimes hilarious, sometimes grueling, always entertaining trip.  Along the way, there is a lot of interesting information I'll share about the nation's fourth-largest city, our beloved ""Petro Metro,"" one of the strangest and most contradictory towns on earth.  Being lavished with praise by the business press for its supposedly strong economy doesn't even begin to tell the whole story of Houston's crony capitalism, nouveau riche attitudes and gratuitous displays of wealth and greed, dependence on undocumented labor and narcissistic underbelly.</p>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p><em>Defying Gay Gravity</em> was initially written as my own personal response to fulfilling on a childhood regret: coming out as a kid in middle school. Instead, I waited until years later when I felt safe and self-assured that it was a step I was willing to take. The book however transformed into the personal journey of Gordi and how he comes to accept himself for who he is: a gay boy looking to find a place for himself in the world.</p>
<p>Students around the ages of 13 and 14, who are struggling to come to terms with their own identity, will really find that Gordi’s voice is relatable. Drawing on their own personal experiences and finding ways to confront and face some questions that they are dealing with, as students or kids, this book can serve as a guide to help them navigate through this challenging part of their lives—LGBTTIQQ2S (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgendered, Intersex, Queer, Questioning, or Two-Spirited) or not.</p>
<p>Providing a platform for the discussions to take place, and having the hard conversations is what it’s about.</p>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>February 2012 marked the beginning of this project.</p>
<p>My name is Greg Kentris, and I’ve been a teacher here in the <em>Greater Toronto Area</em> for six years now. As a kid and now as an adult, I am committed to building and maintaining safe and inclusive spaces for all students, especially those who are LGBTTIQQ2S.</p>
<p>Over the past 16 months, we have had an amazing group of people who have jumped on board to get this book out to meet the people. Editors, Intellectual Property Lawyers, a series of Graphic Designers, Videographers, Artists, Teachers hosted through a number of focus-group sessions, and Families willing to read this book and provide feedback… that this book is so much more ours than it is mine.</p>
<p>It’s our shared commitment to knowing that actions are what makes the difference.</p>
<p>Buying a book and having conversations with your students or youth will help bring Gordi’s experience off the pages, and into the lives of our children.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need</strong></h2>
<p>250 books, in 45 days. That’s our goal. Anything beyond that would be amazing!</p>
<p>So much of the work that went into building this book was thanks to the people, the professionals, who used their trades to help bring this project to life. The skilled, talented, and amazingly gracious people offered so much more of themselves that I could have asked for, at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>By supporting this project, you are not merely buying a book and paying for the printing costs. You would be giving back to those who worked tirelessly in the background, and would be helping to support their continued efforts to causes like this one.</p>
<p>Without these people, <em>Defying Gay Gravity</em> would be as invisible as the students who are struggling to come out.</p>
<h2><strong>What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>Looking at the tiers to the right, whatever option you choose, what you get is the knowledge and awareness that you’re invested in children figuring out their lives for themselves. Being a guide, a coach, a support is a noble task that helps to facilitate the overall process of coming to terms with who are.</p>
<p>Whether you donate money to the project, procure one or more copies of the book, or donate one or several novels to others in the world, you’ll be creating a place for conversations to happen.</p>
<p><em>Defying Gay Gravity</em> is a novel that is much more than a book: it’s a tool to helping someone get their life.</p>
<h2><strong>Educator’s Guide</strong></h2>
<p>Getting our campaign fully backed would mean that the teacher’s we have on stand-by would come together this summer to create an <em>Educator’s Guide</em>. This free resource would be made available on <a href=""http://www.agooddaypress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.agooddaypress.com</a> so that educators who plan on using the book as a read-aloud could draw on some key <em>Language Arts </em>or <em>Dramatic Arts</em> lessons to explore with their class.</p>
<p>The key here is being able to go deeper into the concepts addressed in the book in meaningful ways!</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Your support, your commitment to taking the actions necessary for creating a safe and loving world for generations to come is the real impact.</p>
<p>Being a voice for those who have lost theirs, who continue to be silenced in the various places and spaces of our world (in Canada and especially abroad), this is the real work.</p>
<p>By inspiring the youth of today to go out and be unstoppable allies for the cause, you are choosing to be part of an impact that cannot be measured or quantified. It can only be felt in the hearts and minds of those lives you touch.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>There's nothing unique about my story, Know that upfront. My name is Liz, I was raised as a whitegirl-in-the-Southern-suburbs (of NC) and I have been clinically mentally ill for more than half of my life. Treated like an untouchable outcast whose problems were shrugged off by people who didn't understand the depths of the disease, I spent most of my formative years delving into heavy belief systems regarding self-medication through varied substances and, thus, found myself immersed in a long-term, mentally abusive relationship and a mental prison of my own making. After years of this, I began turning to suicide for answers, which landed me in a mental hospital. Twice.  Fortunately, I failed even at that and, after decades of feeling alone and ostracized, I finally dropped the habits that were holding me back (drinks, stupid love choices, etc.) and started coming around to the benefits of medical health in tandem with therapy. While my life is now consistently better than it ever has been in my 28 years on the planet, I still struggle with the disease, the stigmas and the uphill road that calls itself ""recovery."" <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All this being said, I am still appalled at the amount of stigma surrounding mental issues and the very real struggle the victims and families of mental health have to endure as sudden outcasts of society. It is heartbreaking to me to see that many people view depression as a dead-end, instead of a chance to grow and become a highly-aware human being who can live the rest of his/her life happily. This frustration is the basis of my memoir's theme; the idea that I am not unique should hit home for millions of mentally ill people just as myself, who don't deserve to be lumped into categories and considered as a second class human. This is for all of us.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What I hope to accomplish in writing my memoir is not to produce just another <span style=""font-style: italic;"">wah</span>-look-at-me-I-had-depression-and-now-I'm-magically-healed-with-happy-pills cliche. What I desperately want my audience to understand is that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">MY STORY IS NOT UNUSUAL</span>; that there are literally thousands of those suffering with mental illness from all walks of life whom every one of us is in contact with with on a regular basis. Mental illness on all levels is scary, yes, but every case needs love and support in its toughest times, just like any other person suffering from any other disease. We aren't something to fear or reject; we are people, too; we appreciate empathy and, most of all, intelligent discourse to help us spawn proactive change when interacting with the mentally us as productive citizens. Ultimately,<span style=""font-style: italic;"">I want this book to step outside the usual depression/mental-illness-based memoir and focus on how this is a problem that affects more people than we are inclined to believe. I want this to open the doors for public discussion on the matter. </span>I want to spark debates about the over-medication of psychiatric patients. I want this to change the way society views the treatment of the mentally ill and the way we talk to and about patients of such.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> Since 2006, this is a story that has been buried under stacks of paper 
that have remained untouched because of my 
full-time job as a mother and part-time freelance work. However, with 
these upcoming winter months, I dream of making this project a full-time
 job and completing a rough draft by Spring 2012, after which I hope to 
take the work through a series of edits and workshops.  <br/><br/>If I don't have a little outside monetary help, I can't get this book written and published. I'm constantly running after an almost-4 year old all day, I have zero publishing software, and, most importantly, I can't afford to drive around the Southeast to interview experts in the field of psychology and sociology (which is imperative if this is to be a bulletproof argument for tolerance.). The funding I am requesting will help pay for basic publishing needs, childcare on the days that I need to travel for research purposes and travel provisions while researching and networking. Ultimately, the funding will go straight toward my publication of the 
material, including the sending-out of the rough material to agents and the loads
 of legal hoops I will inevitably have to jump through in order to make 
this happen. <br/><br/>But man, oh man, am I all about sending out freebies, so don't think you'll be getting something for nothing. There will be goodies at each pledge level!<br/> <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tell a friend. Tell a carpool buddy. Tell your minister. Tell your mentally-disabled friend. Tell everyone you can. I want this project to be strong, thoroughly-researched, and bulletproof when finally up against a public audience and I want this memoir to speak on behalf of the mentally ill community to incite change, whether it be in policy or in social discourse. I can use any help that may come my way, even if it isn't in monetary gifts. Right now, more than anything, I'm hoping for support for my dream to change the public face of mental illness and the reaction to such an unnecessarily taboo subject. <br/></p>

This frustration is the basis of my memoir's theme; the idea that I am not unique should hit home for millions of mentally ill people just as myself, who don't deserve to be lumped into categories and considered as a second class human. This is for all of us.


The Impact
What I hope to accomplish in writing my memoir is not to produce just another wah-look-at-me-I-had-depression-and-now-I'm-magically-healed-with-happy-pills cliche. What I desperately want my audience to understand is that MY STORY IS NOT UNUSUAL; that there are literally thousands of those suffering with mental illness from all walks of life whom every one of us is in contact with with on a regular basis. Mental illness on all levels is scary, yes, but every case needs love and support in its toughest times, just like any other person suffering from any other disease. We aren't something to fear or reject; we are people, too; we appreciate empathy and, most of all, intelligent discourse to help us spawn proactive change when interacting with the mentally us as productive citizens. Ultimately,I want this book to step outside the usual depression/mental-illness-based memoir and focus on how this is a problem that affects more people than we are inclined to believe. I want this to open the doors for public discussion on the matter. I want to spark debates about the over-medication of psychiatric patients. I want this to change the way society views the treatment of the mentally ill and the way we talk to and about patients of such.

What We Need & What You Get Since 2006, this is a story that has been buried under stacks of paper 
that have remained untouched because of my 
full-time job as a mother and part-time freelance work. However, with 
these upcoming winter months, I dream of making this project a full-time
 job and completing a rough draft by Spring 2012, after which I hope to 
take the work through a series of edits and workshops.  If I don't have a little outside monetary help, I can't get this book written and published. I'm constantly running after an almost-4 year old all day, I have zero publishing software, and, most importantly, I can't afford to drive around the Southeast to interview experts in the field of psychology and sociology (which is imperative if this is to be a bulletproof argument for tolerance.). The funding I am requesting will help pay for basic publishing needs, childcare on the days that I need to travel for research purposes and travel provisions while researching and networking. Ultimately, the funding will go straight toward my publication of the 
material, including the sending-out of the rough material to agents and the loads
 of legal hoops I will inevitably have to jump through in order to make 
this happen. But man, oh man, am I all about sending out freebies, so don't think you'll be getting something for nothing. There will be goodies at each pledge level! 

Other Ways You Can Help
Tell a friend. Tell a carpool buddy. Tell your minister. Tell your mentally-disabled friend. Tell everyone you can. I want this project to be strong, thoroughly-researched, and bulletproof when finally up against a public audience and I want this memoir to speak on behalf of the mentally ill community to incite change, whether it be in policy or in social discourse. I can use any help that may come my way, even if it isn't in monetary gifts. Right now, more than anything, I'm hoping for support for my dream to change the public face of mental illness and the reaction to such an unnecessarily taboo subject.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Adventure can be yours if you’re willing to create it for yourself.  Looking for places to explore, topics to learn, and new ideas to discover, you can ensure fun, discovery and play are constants in your life. It is possible to give yourself this gift over and over, to turn your life into something incredible and amazing. </p>
<p>This is the belief I tested during the summer of 2017. I quit my job, started my own business, and took off to explore the unknown. What I discovered was a deep love affair with our planet.</p>

<p>Leaving June 27, 2017 from San Diego, CA, my boyfriend and I would spend the next sixty days on the road living out of his car, a 2011 Hyundai Elantra Touring. Through a series of day-trips, we would explore, camp, and hike through nine states and twelve of America’s National Parks, all while I ran my business on the road and he worked remotely. To say the trip changed my life would be an understatement. It allowed me the opportunity to decompress from the stressful years I spent working in fashion in New York City. I was able to reconnect with what I love most about being human: getting to explore, learn &amp; laugh in beautiful environments with people I love.</p>
<p>To share compelling stories, high-quality photographs and life-changing lessons learned from the road, I have written and thoughtfully-designed a coffee table book on the experience. My book, <i>Daytripper: 60 Days on the Road Exploring America’s National Parks</i>, is near launch. Working on designing this book has been amazing getting to relive every precious, magical, and hilarious moment from camping, hiking &amp; working on the road. I can’t wait to share it with you and with the world.</p>

<p>With years of experience in print production, I am incredibly detail-oriented about the print quality and design of the book. I want the finished book to be something you and your guests can experience, rather than just something you can read. I have consulted with both my printer in LA and my connection at Mohawk Paper about some design upgrades that can be added to the book if we sell over 1,000 books. This is ideally how I would like the book to be printed. </p>

With a background in the fashion & commercial photography industries in New York City, I offer a unique perspective on the outdoors and in the National Parks. Beautiful printing and design is just as important to me as sharing a compelling story. The collection of images and stories are laid out in a way to appeal to everyone, but those with a design eye will appreciate the smaller details that have gone into the book. 


Project Timeline
The past four months has been dedicated to writing, editing, designing & proofing this book. The book made it's debut at a community showcase in Los Angeles, CA on January 20, 2018. 


Risks & Upgrades
I have two prototypes in hand and the books are ready to go to press immediately once the campaign comes to an end.
With years of experience in print production, I am incredibly detail-oriented about the print quality and design of the book. I want the finished book to be something you and your guests can experience, rather than just something you can read. I have consulted with both my printer in LA and my connection at Mohawk Paper about some design upgrades that can be added to the book if we sell over 1,000 books. This is ideally how I would like the book to be printed.

<p><b>Body Images: The Naked
Truth:</b></p>
<p>The stories and photos of this
project are from women of all ages who have taken the risk to expose their
vulnerabilities, past or present, about their relationship with their
bodies.  It is estimated that teenage
girls are exposed to over ten hours a day of various media sources (TV, internet,
magazines, music videos, etc.) that clearly place women’s value and power in
youth, beauty and sexuality. Not surprisingly, women hold only 3% of the decision
making roles in mainstream media, and an estimated 65% of women and girls have
disordered eating behaviors.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our goal with this
project is to shift our negative attitudes into self-acceptance and self-love so
that we can influence our daughters, our nieces, our students and future
generations of women. Contributors share their story about their body
image, whether it is their relationship to their weight, hair, skin color or
whatever issue they may face.  </p>
By telling our story, we offer an opportunity to
other women to share theirs so that we can release their grip on us.  This honest <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">portrayal is intended as a

What you get!
For supporting this great endeavor

JK! LOL! You do get some goodies!
There are all sorts of prizes! You could get Poetry Books, Theatre Tickets,
Passes to Tourettes Without Regrets, and you might even get Baruch
Porras-Hernandez at your house for a private performance. The Impact  
This show will showcase some of the
top Latino writer performers in the bay area and the focus of the project is not
just to make a poetry show, but to foster unity, longevity and professional
development for Bay Area Latino poets. The artistic director, Baruch Porras-Hernandez
seeks to not just promote the work of Latino writers, but to get us all to connect,
unite, and build a foundation for further intercultural and multigenerational
dialogue between Latino spoken word artists and writers. Most importantly we hope that this becomes an
annual event, and that in the future when young Latino writers ask that
question ¿Donde Esta Mi Gente? (Where are my people?) they will get an answer:
this festival, this show, these writers.

</p><p>Howdy! We are Kayla and Kaylee,
two best friends and lovers of the open road. We are preparing a new road trip,
our third together and largest yet. During this trip we want to include our
friends, family, and anyone who wants to share in our experiences.  So
we’ve created a campaign centered around the creation of “postcards.” Each
postcard will include a story or poem inspired by experiences on our trip. 
We will mail them to you from the road and then each one will be considered as
a work to be featured in our final collection. Your donation will help us
transform our collection of writings and photos into a unique catalog of our
American adventure.</p>
<p>Over the course of our last two
road trips, we documented our adventures through Instagram, sent the cliché
postcard back home, and journaled independently. Our new catalog project will
merge all three of these activities into one and create a chronicle that we can
share with not only our friends and family, but with anyone seeking inspiration
from travel, nature and more. </p>
<p>On our previous adventures we
explored the American Southwest and the U.S. West Coast. We are now setting out
on a five-week journey across the U.S. East Coast. We have estimated that the
trip will cost over $2,500 (gas, food, lodging and other expenses).</p>
<p>Help us turn this undertaking,
and our “Postcard Prose” idea, into a reality by making a donation. Your
donation will offset some of the cost of this trip, and allow us to save some
of our funds for our future endeavors. </p>
<p>We want to share this experience with you and we
know you'll enjoy looking at, reading, and listening to the fun ways we come up
with to make you a part of this adventure. </p>
<p>Please join us!</p><p>Destinations:</p>

We will mail them to you from the road and then each one will be considered as
a work to be featured in our final collection. Your donation will help us
transform our collection of writings and photos into a unique catalog of our
American adventure.
Over the course of our last two
road trips, we documented our adventures through Instagram, sent the cliché
postcard back home, and journaled independently. Our new catalog project will
merge all three of these activities into one and create a chronicle that we can
share with not only our friends and family, but with anyone seeking inspiration
from travel, nature and more. 
On our previous adventures we
explored the American Southwest and the U.S. West Coast. We are now setting out
on a five-week journey across the U.S. East Coast. We have estimated that the
trip will cost over $2,500 (gas, food, lodging and other expenses).
Help us turn this undertaking,
and our “Postcard Prose” idea, into a reality by making a donation. Your
donation will offset some of the cost of this trip, and allow us to save some
of our funds for our future endeavors. 
We want to share this experience with you and we
know you'll enjoy looking at, reading, and listening to the fun ways we come up
with to make you a part of this adventure.

What is Couch to Couch:

Couch to Couch: My Transforming Travels on the French Huguenot Trail  is the  title of the book I'm writing  describing my adventurous 17 country and 5 continent global journey tracing  some amazing pioneers. Who are these amazing men and women? They're the French Protestants, or Huguenots, who risked death to leave France four hundred years ago.

What do I need:
This appeal is the first stage of my book campaign. The immediate goal of $10,000 is to support my continuing work on Couch to Couch and relocation from California  to my writing community in Geneva where I'll  complete the book. 
Transportation plus short-term housing costs: $8, 365
Consulting costs: $868

 Professsional Development:  $767 I also need response from others' sympathetic to the book's many diverse themes in order to give the book a platform and show me new directions for the book.

The Results:
This first stage will make it possible for me to:
1. Speed the book's completion
2.  Enable me to renew and keep my French Visitor visa given for this project 
3. Place me again in contact with members of the Geneva Writers Group providing support for completion of my book.

Rhea's Info

Looking back, although I grew up in a small rural community, my love of travel was present very early. As a child I was drawn to the glow of lamps at night in dining cars of trains headed north to New York City - I wanted to jump on board and follow those lights.
To date I've published two books:
 Upper Beacon Hill,  Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, SC, 2002
Boston's French Secrets: Guided Walks That Reveal Boston's French Heritage, Images From the Past, Bennington VT, 2004. 
Boston's French Secrets was a WInner of ForeWord Magazine's 2004 Best Travel Guide Book of the Year  Award.
 In addition to a B.A. from Beaver College now Arcadia University,  I also have a M.Ed in Counseling Psychology from Boston University. Writers of all poeple need help ferreting out the quirks and twists of their characters and of course of themselves.
It's an asset I believe that to some I'm not well qualified to write this book, nay sayers can be helpful. What I do have is a passion to find hidden truths, the ability to overcome all limits, to become unstoppable, to take risks to reach the next goal, to find support in meditation and to laugh at myself and life. And most important I love what I do and I never, never give up.

To face death if you were caught crossing the French borders, to face life in prison or in irons if you were apprehended holding secret worship services in the forests at night? I'm not sure of my answers, are you? They leave us untold contributions I'll share - universities, patented inventions, works of art, textiles - the list is endless.
     One new fact alone sends me  out each day:  Over half of the Presidents of the United States are direct descendants of these French who chose to leave France. Starting with George Washington they govern with the conviction of their ancestors. 
     Essentially the Huguenots' story is a hidden segment of history - European history, Amerian history and South American history - that demands to be heard. It has the potential of rewrting history as we know it. That is why we count on you to be part of this project bringing light to a people too long hidden and unknown.
  Risks & Challenges

     The main risk the project faces is my giving up and not completing Couch to Couch.These past months in California I've taken care of some serious medical problems with help from others. During my research I put my body's needs aside and now I'm taking time to correct them.
 Correct and move on to Geneva. It's the ""move on"" mind set I have that overcomes any obstacle. It constantly amazes those close to me. 
Other Ways You Can Help
 Tell your friends, your family, your distant family, your co-workers, even your boss  and your lovers about the Couch to Couch campaign. Get the word out please. And do  send me your ideas for possible improvements and any interesting facts about passionate travel. The Indiegogo share tools are there to help. 
Don't let money or the lack of it  stand in your way. You are an important source of spreading the word. Thanks to each person  who dares to reach out and take a risk by taking action.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

follow their dreams, and also get out and see this vast planet we are so fortunate to live on. It's not fair that this intrinsically worthless green cloth paper we call ""money"" (or lack thereof) could hold so much influence on how we live/ limit our lives. I choose not to let it limit mine! Just because I am broke, does not mean my dreams have to be too! Please help me quench my wanderlust and fund the flow of “MOE-ments” to come while you join me on my journey through
the world’s oldest surviving dynasty! I can’t do it without you! Actually, I can do it and I am doing it. It feels good to get this far on my, but additional funding will get me a lot further!

</div></div>","About Me

Hi. I'm Mike Spinak. I've been writing since I was young, and making pictures since 1998. Lifelong passions for nature, travel, and creative expression have developed into a lifestyle and career in writing and photography. 

Two years ago, I asked the online community for help funding the publication of my first book, Growing Up Humming. It got funded, got published, and soon became the #1 Top-Rated book out of nearly 50,000 in its category on Amazon - and stayed #1 for six months straight. 
About the Book
Now I'm asking for your help funding the publication of a larger, more ambitious book, The Onshore Lives of Northern Elephant Seals.
Elephant seals have one of the strangest lifestyles in the animal kingdom. People would be amazed by the details, but most folks know little or nothing about them. I want to bring their story to you, through my own words and photos.
The Onshore Lives of Northern Elephant Seals is filled with detailed observations of their behaviors, all clearly shown in photos, and explained with simple but deep explanations. 
Why It Matters
Northern elephant seals were hunted heavily, until they were believed to have been driven extinct. It's harder to appreciate the lives of creatures we know little about. The better we understand nature, the more it matters to us, and the better we are at taking care of it. One can't help but respect these remarkable beasts, upon learning the extremes their survival entails. Furthermore, the better we understand biology and ecology, the better we are at making the smartest decisions about managing our world.
The Onshore Lives of Northern Elephant Seals can help inform people both about these majestic creatures, and about how biology works.
Where the Money Goes
The book is already written and photographed. Now I just need to fund the costs of turning the text and pictures into a published book. Your prepayments will go toward editing, proofreading, graphic design, cover design, book design, purchasing ISBN codes, formatting for various eBook formats, and all of the other costs of publishing a book. With your help, I can get it published within just a few months.
What You Get

You can get an eBook of The Onshore Lives of Northern Elephant Seals; your name listed in the book as a backer; an eBook of my previous book, Growing Up Humming; an eBook of my next book, when it is ready; a high resolution digital photo file of a nice elephant seal picture, suitable for printing large; and 3 hours of wildlife photography instruction, through one-on-one video conferencing, where we can discuss vision, technique, gear, animal tracking, or whatever you prefer.

Everyone who has contributed content to the magazine is a current student of CSU Channel Islands, alumni, or a member of the community. For most, this will be their first published work. I'm producing the project myself, with 9 other individuals submitting content, and a handful of experts looking over my shoulder and giving me nudges here and there. </p>
<p>The goal of the project is to create an outlet for creative individuals to put their work out for others to enjoy, and get their name in print. A huge step of becoming successful in the creative world is getting used to people seeing your work and knowing who you are based on what work you're producing.</p>
<p>After the first issue is printed, <i>Negative Assets</i> will continue on in many other issues and volumes. It is my goal, and all else contributing, that the project will continue on, gaining interest of other like-minded individuals to put the work in and make future projects happen. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The reason <i>Negative Assets</i> is in need of funding boils down to the printing cost. After searching around the community for different printers, the only one that seemed relatively feasible was going to cost an upwards of $1,100 for the smallest batch we were willing to print (100 copies) and at a smaller page count. </p>
<p>A company based out of the UK, <a href=""http://www.newspaperclub.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Newspaper Club</a>, offers printing of relatively small batches for far less cash, and prints/ships very quickly.  For the size of the magazine, the cost for printing 100 copies is going to run $655.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So far, I've managed to get a decent amount of advertising space sold to
local businesses, but it isn't quite enough. There is a goal of $700 set for
this project. If the goal is met, I'll be able to print 50-100 extra copies. Any
extra funds will go towards printing future issues.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The capstone project is meant to be a culmination of what a student has learned at CSU Channel Islands, and demonstrate how they'll use their knowledge and skills to progress onward towards a career. <i>Negative Assets</i> is a literary magazine, and allows creative individuals to showcase their talents, dreams, and ambitions. It is an outlet for the contributors, as well as myself, to hold out the magazine and show that they made it in print, and they made the effort, and have the skills to produce something great.</p>
<p>By contributing to this project, you'll help make a huge step for the next generation of writers. Everyone contributing is a local artist, sharing their work with the community. Become a part of the community.</p>
<p>Overall, I hope to promote leisurely reading in the community. I'm tired of hearing ""I hate reading."" It is truly is painful. Most of the stories are genre pieces, and very entertaining, while there are a handful of editorial pieces. With future issues, hopefully the list of contributors will grow following the success of Issue #1. And hopefully this will lend future capstone courses to try something similar, and not just <i>get</i> their name out  there, but put it out there.</p>
<p>It is my sincerest hope that you're willing to contribute. On the right side of the page are two different perks. A contribution of $10 or more will earn an acknowledgement on the backside of the magazine. $15 or more will not only earn an acknowledgement, but also a copy of the magazine, shipped or hand delivered, pending how far away from Camarillo you happen to be. A contribution of $0.01 will earn my thanks and extreme gratitude for taking the time to help out and learn about my project.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Starting this project opened up a different arena for me. I was somewhat familiar with the software needed, but immersing myself in this project has given me a lot of insight into how the technology works, and also how the business works. Contacting different printers, seeing what they offer, where to shop around. It has been a learning curve, but has also put me into an exciting industry. </p>
<p>This project will be successful. Everyone that's contributed has made sure of it. They've put their hearts into it, summed up the courage to show their work to the world, and now they're looking for support. </p>
<p>The financial burden isn't tremendous, but it's there. If this project interests you, please lend your support. Then, read and enjoy the magazine. Help fulfill the purpose of <i>Negative Assets</i>, and enjoy the work that myself and the 9 other contributors put into it. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you're unable to contribute, there are alternatives if you're still willing to become involved. If you know someone who is interested in reading independent literature, or is an aspiring writer, turn them on to the magazine. Tell them about it, and let them know that there is an outlet for them to share their creative interests, and make their voices heard as well.</p>
<p>Share this page on Facebook. Email it around to people you think would be interested in a project like this. It's new, it's up and coming, and it has room to grow.</p>
<p>There will be a finite amount of copies. If you buy all 100 copies, but still need more, do not panic. I'll be creating an online version after printing. What format or device it will be available on is yet to be seen, but it will be here before you know it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Thank you very much for taking time to read my story and considering contribution to a project that is built on a lot of passion, a lot of guts, and commitment. If you are interested in this project and have questions, are looking for other ways to contribute, are curious about submitting your own content for future issues, or are wanting to extend kind wishes, please contact me at taylor.farner@gmail.com. Thank you again for your time.</p>

Overall, I hope to promote leisurely reading in the community. I'm tired of hearing ""I hate reading."" It is truly is painful. Most of the stories are genre pieces, and very entertaining, while there are a handful of editorial pieces. With future issues, hopefully the list of contributors will grow following the success of Issue #1. And hopefully this will lend future capstone courses to try something similar, and not just get their name out  there, but put it out there.
It is my sincerest hope that you're willing to contribute. On the right side of the page are two different perks. A contribution of $10 or more will earn an acknowledgement on the backside of the magazine. $15 or more will not only earn an acknowledgement, but also a copy of the magazine, shipped or hand delivered, pending how far away from Camarillo you happen to be. A contribution of $0.01 will earn my thanks and extreme gratitude for taking the time to help out and learn about my project.   Risks & Challenges Starting this project opened up a different arena for me. I was somewhat familiar with the software needed, but immersing myself in this project has given me a lot of insight into how the technology works, and also how the business works. Contacting different printers, seeing what they offer, where to shop around. It has been a learning curve, but has also put me into an exciting industry. 
This project will be successful. Everyone that's contributed has made sure of it. They've put their hearts into it, summed up the courage to show their work to the world, and now they're looking for support. 
The financial burden isn't tremendous, but it's there. If this project interests you, please lend your support. Then, read and enjoy the magazine. Help fulfill the purpose of Negative Assets, and enjoy the work that myself and the 9 other contributors put into it. 
    Other Ways You Can Help If you're unable to contribute, there are alternatives if you're still willing to become involved. If you know someone who is interested in reading independent literature, or is an aspiring writer, turn them on to the magazine. Tell them about it, and let them know that there is an outlet for them to share their creative interests, and make their voices heard as well.
Share this page on Facebook. Email it around to people you think would be interested in a project like this. It's new, it's up and coming, and it has room to grow.
There will be a finite amount of copies. If you buy all 100 copies, but still need more, do not panic. I'll be creating an online version after printing. What format or device it will be available on is yet to be seen, but it will be here before you know it.

Thank you very much for taking time to read my story and considering contribution to a project that is built on a lot of passion, a lot of guts, and commitment. If you are interested in this project and have questions, are looking for other ways to contribute, are curious about submitting your own content for future issues, or are wanting to extend kind wishes, please contact me at taylor.farner@gmail.com. Thank you again for your time.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Ben &amp; Julia, a young couple from Oxford, England who are passionate about cooking and sustainability. Cooking together is our favourite way to spend an evening. Often this was from recipe books which although created great tasting food left us with excess ingredients that would end up being thrown out after not knowing what to do with them.</p>
<p>This led us to think differently about recipe creation. To <i>rethink</i> the way we cooked and began our journey to creating this cookbook that not only shares some of our <strong>favourite recipes</strong>, but is able to teach others what we've learned about <strong>zero waste cooking</strong>. We can't wait for you to join us on our sustainable cooking journey!</p>
<p>As two young-professionals we are unfortunately not able to go to print straight away. Therefore, by becoming a Rethink Cooking contributor in this campaign, <strong><u>you</u> will be the reason</strong> that we can actually print and get our <strong>cookbook self-published</strong>! Something that we have dreamed about since starting this project a year ago.</p>
<p>As a contributor you will <strong>receive recognition in the book</strong> and may even have the opportunity to have a <strong>recipe named after you</strong>! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise a <strong>minimum of £800</strong> to get our first set of books printed.</p>
<p>If we are able to have more than that fundraised, we will be able to print extra books that can be sold after our campaign ends which would be incredible!</p>
<p>If we are not able to reach the fundraising goal, you will still get your cookbook, however it will unfortunately mean that we'll have to dip into our personal savings to get the books printed which is not ideal!</p>
<p>To ensure that we are able to reach our goal, we have put together a list of perks for those that invest in us! These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognition in our cookbook thanking you for making this happen!</li>
<li>Access to our newsletter with updates on the book's progress and exclusive recipes!</li>
<li>Rethink Cooking merchandise that can be purchased alongside the cookbook or individually! These include stickers, mugs, aprons and more!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Although many may think that this is ""just another cookbook"" we see it as <strong>far more than that</strong>. One-third of all food produced is thrown away. Of that 70% comes from the household. This food waste then produces 6% of the world's greenhouse gases. These are damning statistics that <u>have</u> to change as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Rethink Cooking cookbook will be more than just a set of recipes. It will be the beginning of many people's zero waste journey with tips and tricks on how to reduce your food waste at home, and showing that everyone can enjoy their favourite meals in a sustainable way. </p>
<p>It's not about one person reducing their food waste perfectly, it's about everyone doing imperfectly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge will be the distribution of the cookbooks. This is going to be an international affair with the books being printed in Julia's home country of Canada! We want to make sure that no matter where you are in the world you will be able to get a copy of our book. </p>
<p>Our other challenge is to get the books printed and distributed before Christmas. We are currently in overdrive working our hardest to finalise everything and are hoping that by the end of October they should be ready to go to print. If we are not able to get the books to you by Christmas however we will be sending out exclusive Christmas menus and other gifts to ensure you are getting your moneys worth. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We completely understand that not everyone will be able to purchase a book or contribute financially. We therefore would love it if you could share this campaign with friends and family, and get the word out to everyone would be interested in what we are doing!</p>
<p>The more noise you can make about the campaign, the better!</p>
<p>You may even receive this as a present if you send this as a hint to a loved one! ;) </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>   Hi! </p>
<p>   I hope you liked the little clip. We live in a world where no one wants to grow up. The roots of Neverland run deep. Childhood is amazing and it was once just a fleeting life
stage. Now, thanks in part to Peter Pan, the pinup boy for people who never want to grow up, childhood is available as a permanent lifestyle choice but there is a cost for having children parent children, for putting perpetual boys in charge of companies and countries and for leaving young people to self initiate.
‘Leaving Neverland’  weighs up the costs, delightfully skewers perpetual boys and offers contemporary Rites of Passage as a timely way out of Neverland. <br/></p>
<p>The book 'Leaving Neverland' is complete and a generous preview is available from the <a href=""http://www.leavingneverland.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Leaving Neverland"">""Leaving Neverland' website</a>.
 I am here on IndieGogo for support to pay for press releases and to promote the book to libraries and retail outlets. I would also like to pay for a series of animated clips
 about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-S6qOLp3M"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Nuclear Powered Immaturity"">Peter Pan in the 21st Century</a>. I hope you find this project one 
worth supporting. It is a book with an important message.<br/></p>
<p align=""center"" style=""text-align: center;"">   <b>“Behind every preventable threat
to the future of the human race stands a boy in a man's body with both of his
hands in the cookie jar set aside for future generations.” </b></p>
<p>   Whether that threat is building Nuclear power plants near fault
lines, oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, GM
food, the Global Financial crisis or climate change the behaviour behind each
disaster is one of childish greed and selfishness coupled with short term
thinking and a total lack of responsibility or compassion for the resulting
social and environmental devastation. There are a few movies that are starting
to highlight this phenomenon e.g.  'Inside Job,' 'Company Men,' 'Avatar' 'Capitalism a Love
Story' 'Enron the Smartest guys in the Room' and 'Confessions of an Economic Hit Man' (a book but some great author interviews on YouTube).<br/></p>
<p>       My name is Daniel Prokop.
I've been around the block a few times, nearly 50 times if you call one year a
block. I've worked at a senior level for the largest company in the world, I've
run my own business and I have worked for a harm prevention charity; three
vastly different sandpits all linked by similar childish behavior, some of it
my own. </p>
<p>    I didn't really start to grow up until I was unexpectedly
faced with becoming a dad at the age of 32. I almost said ""this is too
hard"" but somehow I got my head around fatherhood and I have loved being a
dad, loved it. I didn't want my son to wait until he was 32 to start to grow up which is why I became involved in contemporary Rites of Passage. [A Rite of
 Passage is simply
a supported event or ceremony that marks the transition from one life 
stage to
another e.g. from child to young adult, man to father, woman 
to
mother, older to Elder and death.]</p>
<p>    Rites of Passage once provided the link between physical body growth and emotional growing up. Find out more about this by reading the book. <br/></p>
<p>   I have spent the last two years writing and working on promoting 'Leaving Neverland' and prior to this I was working for a harm prevention
charity. I am a self published author and I am finding it very difficult to
get this book and the message out there without an advertising and promotions budget. </p>
<p>    'Leaving Neverland' will soon be distributed via Lightning
Source which will make it available in paperback on a Print on Demand Basis to readers as well as book stores and Libraries in the USA, Australia
and the UK
which is exciting. It is already available in Kindle and all eBook formats and
what I need now is some financial support for PR and promotion.</p>
<p>    I would love your help to make this happen, for our sake
ffs (for our futures sake) it is time to leave Neverland.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     If you are tired of the little boys clubs that run many parts

</div></div>","Our Story
   Hi! 
   I hope you liked the little clip. We live in a world where no one wants to grow up. The roots of Neverland run deep. Childhood is amazing and it was once just a fleeting life
stage. Now, thanks in part to Peter Pan, the pinup boy for people who never want to grow up, childhood is available as a permanent lifestyle choice but there is a cost for having children parent children, for putting perpetual boys in charge of companies and countries and for leaving young people to self initiate.
‘Leaving Neverland’  weighs up the costs, delightfully skewers perpetual boys and offers contemporary Rites of Passage as a timely way out of Neverland. 
The book 'Leaving Neverland' is complete and a generous preview is available from the ""Leaving Neverland' website.
 I am here on IndieGogo for support to pay for press releases and to promote the book to libraries and retail outlets. I would also like to pay for a series of animated clips
 about Peter Pan in the 21st Century. I hope you find this project one 
worth supporting. It is a book with an important message.
   “Behind every preventable threat
to the future of the human race stands a boy in a man's body with both of his
hands in the cookie jar set aside for future generations.” 
   Whether that threat is building Nuclear power plants near fault
lines, oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, GM
food, the Global Financial crisis or climate change the behaviour behind each
disaster is one of childish greed and selfishness coupled with short term
thinking and a total lack of responsibility or compassion for the resulting
social and environmental devastation. There are a few movies that are starting
to highlight this phenomenon e.g.  'Inside Job,' 'Company Men,' 'Avatar' 'Capitalism a Love
Story' 'Enron the Smartest guys in the Room' and 'Confessions of an Economic Hit Man' (a book but some great author interviews on YouTube).
       My name is Daniel Prokop.
I've been around the block a few times, nearly 50 times if you call one year a
block. I've worked at a senior level for the largest company in the world, I've
run my own business and I have worked for a harm prevention charity; three
vastly different sandpits all linked by similar childish behavior, some of it
my own. 
    I didn't really start to grow up until I was unexpectedly
faced with becoming a dad at the age of 32. I almost said ""this is too
hard"" but somehow I got my head around fatherhood and I have loved being a
dad, loved it. I didn't want my son to wait until he was 32 to start to grow up which is why I became involved in contemporary Rites of Passage. [A Rite of
 Passage is simply
a supported event or ceremony that marks the transition from one life 
stage to
another e.g. from child to young adult, man to father, woman 
to
mother, older to Elder and death.]
    Rites of Passage once provided the link between physical body growth and emotional growing up. Find out more about this by reading the book. 
   I have spent the last two years writing and working on promoting 'Leaving Neverland' and prior to this I was working for a harm prevention
charity. I am a self published author and I am finding it very difficult to
get this book and the message out there without an advertising and promotions budget. 
    'Leaving Neverland' will soon be distributed via Lightning
Source which will make it available in paperback on a Print on Demand Basis to readers as well as book stores and Libraries in the USA, Australia
and the UK
which is exciting. It is already available in Kindle and all eBook formats and
what I need now is some financial support for PR and promotion.
    I would love your help to make this happen, for our sake
ffs (for our futures sake) it is time to leave Neverland.
The Impact
     If you are tired of the little boys clubs that run many parts
of the economy, if CEO's that are vastly overpaid on a strict 'take no
responsibility now, take no responsibility later' basis make you sick then I
invite you to read this book and support this initiative. If you are a parent
and you want to know what you can do to help your children to grow up
emotionally then please read this book and let other parents know about it too. Parents play a huge role in whether their children ever grow up emotionally.
     One of the messages of this book is that we need to stop
giving respect and power to the Peter Pan's who are unaccountable bullies that
have confused aggression and domination as signs of strength (amongst many other foibles
which I describe.) If they behave like children we need to treat them like children and many of these besuited infants have not played nice and need some time out.
The world is changing very rapidly, contemporary Rites of Passage can
quickly become a core plank of a revolution in education that would be timely. We have left our young people to self initiate for centuries too long
and the consequences are all around us. We really, really need healthy adults
in charge more than ever.

If i achieve this, YOU will have succeeded in being part of another miracle.</p>
<p>I feel (already, since i'm already in the Tom Bird author's coaching system) sheparded through every step, corner and detail, from writing, to editing, to style editing, to support to complete cover art and get it up, SEO optimization, etc. The care in the details of every step . . marketing, support for every single tiny detail required in cultivating a best-selling book with the tools that are available.</p>

After 20 years of this starlit passion for the stars planets and astrology, the star surfer, Azlan White, is requesting your support of her life-full of astrology wisdom, being distilled into a simple book guiding you to your own personal treasure map!
Because of Azlan's current state of independant self-employment through astrology filled with volunteer positions, she requests your support to publish her first and most important astrology book ! A real treasure map! (to your soul)
Would you be willing to donate $35-$1000 to help her achieve a small dream?


Publishing a Book in today's world is so much easier than ever before!  With your help, Azlan can publish her first astrology book.
Here's where your money goes: $16,995.50 + processing fees = $17,800.00

Saturating the market with my book, so every book buyer can find it, is a way of accessign a ""best seller list.""  As a team, we're aiming for making me what is called a ""best seller."" If i achieve this, YOU will have succeeded in being part of another miracle.
I feel (already, since i'm already in the Tom Bird author's coaching system) sheparded through every step, corner and detail, from writing, to editing, to style editing, to support to complete cover art and get it up, SEO optimization, etc. The care in the details of every step . . marketing, support for every single tiny detail required in cultivating a best-selling book with the tools that are available.
Tom, Rama and their team have allowed me to show up to retreats as a mentor, and continue to receive the support of the publishing program webinars--without paying anything additional after my first retreat--revealing--its roots in a large heart. I still owe a little money on that first retreat to Loren at BODY of Santa Fe. Thank you Loren for your patience. Your debt is covered in this campaign budget, at $300 if i raise the full amount.
Tom Bird and his team has raised my spirits to keep writing, whenever i can squeeze it in!  They are inescapably magical in my life!  I am so so grateful to this gifted collaborating team! I can't say enough good things here without boring you!
I invite you, especially if you've ever wanted to write a book before, to join myself as an ally or cheerleader, and Tom Bird as an authors coach, in one of his retreats coming up in the fall or next year! Let me know when you'd like me to join you for the retreat and we'll make it happen!
Because of Tom Bird, I've re-ignited my passion for writing and a level of enthusiasm about teaching ""beginners,"" my passion and mastery: Astrology in a way that is real. Since Tom has led me to speak to ""the everyday brick layer."" I've found his author's coaching, invaluable for my own self-disciplinning, completion, and writing mastery.  i feel blessed to have achieved more mastery over writing and publishing, in small and large ways in his 3 day retreats. Whenever i go--i make miracles out of myself. In that i'm reaching to put vast concepts into simplifying and distilling words for the ""every day brick layer.""

<p><i>Perennial</i></p>
<p>In my AP English Language class last year we read Virginia Woolf’s “A Room Of One’s Own”, and as I read, one quote inexplicably changed the trajectory of the next 5 months of my life, “Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.” This quote started my 5-month, 84-page, 4759-word journey to creating <i>Perennial</i>.</p>
<p>During the first month of writing poetry I read “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost, a poem widely misquoted. Initially, I thought it could be about two roads diverging in the woods, but now I believe it could just be a metaphor. By the second reading, I realized it was not about taking “the road less traveled”. As I interpreted it, Frost regretted this decision, wondering if he should have returned at any given moment. By the fourth reading I realized there’s no definite answer, and I loved the ambiguity. I used to look at poetry and think of how pretentious it sounded, and how it had to be in Shakespearean English to be acceptable. I later realized I had become annoyed when friends referred to poetry as Shakespeare’s love sonnets, clearly disregarding Edgar Allan Poe’s breathtaking “Annabel Lee”. This became one of my biggest breakthroughs; poems have the inability to be confined into one form. </p>
<p>Not long after, I took pride in my work, knowing not all writing had to be structured in iambic pentameter. I learned that with free verse I had the freedom to write myself into history, even if it was just my own. So, a year ago I bought a sketchbook and made it a habit to write every day. After crafting a poem I transcribed it onto my computer. At one point I was so hysterical I kept my journal on my bedside, just incase there was a fire. You could say the fear of living my life without leaving a single trace behind motivated me to write a book. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I am motivated to keep a journal as a way to be able to speak to my children long after I’ve passed. Words have this incredible notion of not aging, which would make me frozen in time. In Virginia Woolf’s “A Room Of One’s Own”, she tackles topics that are still relatable to this day. She debates the idea of women being inferior to men; inequality is widely comprehensible today. Think about it this way, she’s a woman that died long before I was born and she’s talking to me; I am reading the words she wrote nearly 85 years ago. Which means that books will continue to impact people, and the beautiful works of poetry I’ve read by Nayyirah Waheed, Sarah Kay, and Rupi Kaur will permanently shape the way I view life. </p>
<p>As time passed I developed this habit of ordering 8 to 10 books of poetry at a time. These books, however, did not feed my ravenous desire for poetry. Shortly, writing became as easy as looking out a plane window, getting an idea, and writing it down on my sketchbook.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ultimately, I titled my book <i>Perennial </i>meaning perpetual, everlasting, recurrent; unlike other styles of writing, poetry is the one that has left a lasting effect on me. Writing has sparked my love for learning, yet there’s room to improve because Sarah Kay perfectly describes in one sentence what I’ve been trying to convey in 650 words,  “So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets, I keep trying, hoping that one day I’ll write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed.” </p>
<p>This book has made me the person I am today. It has helped me through issues I never imagined as a child I would have to deal with. If I hadn't written these thoughts down I would still be dwelling with myself. This is why I want to publish my book. I want teens that have been through what I have to know that they're not alone. I want this book to resonate with people; I want it to connect with anyone who wants to read it. I don't want others  to have the same boundaries I once created for myself. My goal is to get 2,000 dollars in order to make around 100 copies of my book. However if I don't reach that goal I will still publish the books I can with the allotted money. Know that 25 dollars help me publish one of them! Please help me get my thoughts out there, help my story be heard! Share this if you can! Thank you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi. I'm Hannah Miller. I am good at writing Utopian literature (it's been documented in <i>Politico</i>, for godssake), and I am writing a book based on the society of Burning Man. Burning Man is a punk-rock Rainbow Gathering and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>There aren't a lot of Utopian writers anymore, and like reverse-Orwell, most of the stuff we write is dark. But you have to see deep in there to appreciate Utopia in the first place, right?</p>
<p>Burning Man is the ultimate oracle. Whatever you want to see, whatever you want revealed, will be revealed to you. So I am writing a book about the people who create Burning Man, and the environment that is created by their devotion. It's spiritual - in a beautiful, cramped, half-assed 21st-Century American sort of way.</p>
<p>This book should be very good, and may or may not include any of the following elements: fire, water, dust, drugs, apocalypse, nudity, life/death nexus, confusion, boredom, primal fear and joy, a total loss of meaning and/or numbness at high altitudes, lots of putting up and taking down of tents, and most importantly, an underlying, unspoken, group commitment to hope.</p>
<p>Here is, in fact, a preview, from the Burning Blog, which I wrote last year:</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Based in Ypsilanti, Toronto, Brooklyn, Champaign-Urbana and  Dallas-Fort Worth, <a href=""https://culturalgutter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Cultural Gutter</strong></a> was founded in 2003 by writer, filmmaker and game designer Jim Munroe and comics critic and artist Guy Leshinski to provide clear-eyed, thoughtful writing on disreputable art. Since then, we've had twelve editors in two countries and eight cities write on comics, genre films, Indian b-movies, tv, science fiction, fantasy, horror, romance and video games. In all that time we paid our writers, both our editors and guest stars. Then we lost our funding grant, but a small, rag-tag band of donors joined forces with the Gutter to keep us online and help us keep our commitment to paying writers for their work. Thus, the Gutterthon was born. And thanks to our readers like you, the Cultural Gutter has been sustained without ads, subscriptions or a paywall.</p>
<p>At the Gutter we like to think we offer something special and we're kind of proud of it. The Gutter features thoughtful, well-written articles on topics like: American Sci Fi Folk horror; Godzilla and realism; relatability and <i>Planet Of The Apes</i>; letting something you love reboot; romance and the belief that people can change; Janelle Monáe as the American cool; Ancient Egypt in contemporary Indian film; <i>Hellraiser</i> and ""development hell""; mastering the art of losing; ""Tilda Swinton: Secret Scottish Samurai""; Duran Duran &amp; William S. Burroughs' <i>Wild Boys</i>; and so much <i>Adventure Time</i>. So please click ""Back It"" and keep the Gutter flowing with the writing you love. Even if you can only throw in a buck, we will thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $1600 and it breaks down to $250/year/writer or about $20/article; $250/year for the Evil Overlord for publishing, promoting, and updating the site on our new platform, finding new writers, day-to-day site management, making sure the perks are shipped out, and continuing work on <i>The Cultural Gutter Must Be Destroyed</i>, a collection of essays from the Gutter's current line-up. Approximately $200 will go towards website hosting and domain registration. The remaining funds will go toward perks, shipping, promotional materials, Indiegogo and Paypal fees, and paying guest writers.</p>

And all three noir anthologies include a story by the Gutter's own Carol Borden.</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Weird Noir</i> is a genre-bending collection mixing madness and the hardboiled</strong>. ""On the gritty backstreets of a crumbling city, tough dames and dangerous men trade barbs, witticisms and a few gunshots. But there’s a new twist where urban decay meets the eldritch borders of another world: WEIRD NOIR. Featuring thugs who sprout claws and fangs, gangsters with tentacles and the occasional succubus siren. The ambience is pure noir but the characters aren’t just your average molls and mugs—the vamps might just be vamps. It’s Patricia Highsmith meets Shirley Jackson or Dashiell Hammett filtered through H. P. Lovecraft. Mad, bad and truly dangerous to know, but irresistible all the same.""</p>
<p>In <strong><i>Noir Carnival</i></strong> ""the carnies bring you stories, a heady mix of shadows and candy floss, dreams gone sour and nights that go on too long. Let them lure you into the tent. Carnival: whether you picture it as a traveling fair in the back roads of America or the hedonistic nights of the pre-Lenten festival where masks hide faces while the skin glories in its revelation, it’s about spectacle, artificiality and the things we hide behind the greasepaint or the tent flap. Let these writers lead you on a journey into that heart of blackened darkness and show you what’s behind the glitz. Underneath, we’re all freaks after all…""</p>
<p><strong><i>Drag Noir</i> is a genre- and gender-bending collection of stories</strong>. ""This is where glamour meets grit, where everyone’s wearing a disguise (whether they know it or not) and knowing the players takes a lot more than simply reading the score cards. Maybe everyone’s got something to hide, but they’ve got something to reveal, too. Scratch the surface and explore what secrets lie beneath — it’s bound to cost someone…a lot.""</p>
<p><strong>Graham Wynd's <i>Love Is A Grift</i> starts out with obsession and just might end in death</strong>. ""How does obsession begin? For one hit man it starts with a target he just can’t kill. She leads him on a deadly spree across Europe. With every step he’s in deeper. Each crime binds them together like a vow and only death can part them. But will it be his… or hers?</p>
<p>Love is a Grift and the other stories in this collection offer a fresh take on a classic genre, that begins with obsession and most often ends with death.""</p>
<p><strong>A Dull Gift Package including one copy of Basil Morley, Esq.'s delightful tome, <i>How to be Dull: Standing Out Next to Genius</i></strong>: two postcards; two stickers; two badges; and a handful of vintage (i.e. faded) Classic Martini napkins. ""Are you, too, a refuge from the relentless pressure to be 'creative?' Have you had enough of 'pushing the envelope' and 'thinking outside the box' to last the next three lifetimes or more? Stop trying to succeed and learn to be DULL. Dull people may not end up presidents of the free world or at top of the pop charts, but they do get on with a minimum of fuss and practically no pressure. Your weekends will remain free. You will not need to purchase a lot of expensive equipment. There are no rigid rules to follow. You can idle through this book or simply give up when your curiosity has been exhausted. This volume makes a great gift for your boss or any other dynamic go-getters you know. Wink and tell them it’s all in good fun, but get ready for a blissful calm to descend once they have grasped the simple art of dullness. The late Basil Morley, esq., spent a lifetime judiciously avoiding the limelight in one dull pursuit after another. He may be unable to do so in the afterlife, as there remain treasures like this pamphlet to be looted from his jumble of notebooks, cabinets and miniature terrariums. Though he might quail at the sudden wave of untoward attention, there is little he can do about it now. 'I laughed, I cried, I quoted the best lines to Boccaccio.' — Geoffrey Chaucer 'He stole the best bits from me, the bastard.' — Dorothy Parker 'I have to revise my famous essay on laughter now.' — Henri Bergson.""</p>

""In the 1960s Shaw Brothers Studios revolutionised martial arts filmmaking. Movie mogul Sir Run Run Shaw developed a way to churn out lavish blockbusters quickly and cheaply. An assembly line approach kept his filmmakers busy but access to an extraordinary pool of resources meant they could 'ask for the moon.' This book is a case study exploring how a brilliant, driven entrepreneur and his audaciously creative filmmakers conducted a bold experiment in business and movie-making innovation.""</p>

Raffles, gentleman thief; Louis Feuillade's <i>Fantomas</i> and <i>Les Vampires</i>; the history of the Martini; Diabolik, Kriminal, and the skeleton suit-clad maniacs of Italy and Turkey; James Bond, amari, negronis, and how Ian Fleming and Lucky Luciano saved the Allied invasion of Sicily; the history of masked Mexican wrestlers and the partnership of El Santo and Blue Demon; and the weird, wild world of the Rat Pack in the 1960s and how the grim, violent Matt Helm novels became slapstick spy spoofs starring Dean Martin. These are tales of mobsters, movie stars, masked men, torch singers, crooners, and hustlers -- with dozens of cocktail recipes and music suggestions that pair perfectly.""</p>

""For the first time in English comes a remarkable literary discovery. In 1928, Turkish author Ali Rıza Seyfioğlu pirated Bram Stoker’s Dracula, rewriting it with new material, patriotic overtones, and Islam. A rare example of a 'bootleg' novel, it’s also the first adaptation to plainly identify Dracula as the historical warlord Vlad the Impaler.""</p>

<p>If we don't reach our goal, we'll use the funds to print and ship your perks and see how much we can pay each editor. If we exceed our goal, we would use the extra funds to print promotional materials or hire more guest writers. If we significantly exceed our goal, we will use our funds to give the writers a raise this year.</p>
<p>We will be unlocking more perks as the campaign continues, but even $1 gets our Undying Thanks! (Really, a buck does make a difference).</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We like to think that the Gutter offers something special: Clear-eyed, thoughtful and thought-provoking writing on disreputable art. If you donate or support the campaign by sharing, you will help keep the Gutter online and running; support our particular take on disreputable art; and help support paying writers for their work.</p>
<p>We ran a successful last fundraiser year, and, thanks to everyone's help, we escaped our old webhost, moved to a new webhost, and have been working on making the new Gutter as good as can be. And we kept the Gutter going. The Cultural Gutter's survival depends on Gutterthon and on you. We know it's a difficult time for creators of all kinds, that platforms are valued more than content. But we believe with your help, we can keep the Gutter flowing with quality writing. </p>
<p>We know that times are hard for a lot of people and any little bit helps, even a retweet or sharing our campaign on Facebook. Indiegogo has tools that make it easy. Please consider using them even if you can't contribute money. Anything you do to help is appreciated.</p>

A Dull Gift Package including one copy of Basil Morley, Esq.'s delightful tome, How to be Dull: Standing Out Next to Genius: two postcards; two stickers; two badges; and a handful of vintage (i.e. faded) Classic Martini napkins. ""Are you, too, a refuge from the relentless pressure to be 'creative?' Have you had enough of 'pushing the envelope' and 'thinking outside the box' to last the next three lifetimes or more? Stop trying to succeed and learn to be DULL. Dull people may not end up presidents of the free world or at top of the pop charts, but they do get on with a minimum of fuss and practically no pressure. Your weekends will remain free. You will not need to purchase a lot of expensive equipment. There are no rigid rules to follow. You can idle through this book or simply give up when your curiosity has been exhausted. This volume makes a great gift for your boss or any other dynamic go-getters you know. Wink and tell them it’s all in good fun, but get ready for a blissful calm to descend once they have grasped the simple art of dullness. The late Basil Morley, esq., spent a lifetime judiciously avoiding the limelight in one dull pursuit after another. He may be unable to do so in the afterlife, as there remain treasures like this pamphlet to be looted from his jumble of notebooks, cabinets and miniature terrariums. Though he might quail at the sudden wave of untoward attention, there is little he can do about it now. 'I laughed, I cried, I quoted the best lines to Boccaccio.' — Geoffrey Chaucer 'He stole the best bits from me, the bastard.' — Dorothy Parker 'I have to revise my famous essay on laughter now.' — Henri Bergson.""

If we don't reach our goal, we'll use the funds to print and ship your perks and see how much we can pay each editor. If we exceed our goal, we would use the extra funds to print promotional materials or hire more guest writers. If we significantly exceed our goal, we will use our funds to give the writers a raise this year.
We will be unlocking more perks as the campaign continues, but even $1 gets our Undying Thanks! (Really, a buck does make a difference).
The Impact
We like to think that the Gutter offers something special: Clear-eyed, thoughtful and thought-provoking writing on disreputable art. If you donate or support the campaign by sharing, you will help keep the Gutter online and running; support our particular take on disreputable art; and help support paying writers for their work.
We ran a successful last fundraiser year, and, thanks to everyone's help, we escaped our old webhost, moved to a new webhost, and have been working on making the new Gutter as good as can be. And we kept the Gutter going. The Cultural Gutter's survival depends on Gutterthon and on you. We know it's a difficult time for creators of all kinds, that platforms are valued more than content. But we believe with your help, we can keep the Gutter flowing with quality writing. 
We know that times are hard for a lot of people and any little bit helps, even a retweet or sharing our campaign on Facebook. Indiegogo has tools that make it easy. Please consider using them even if you can't contribute money. Anything you do to help is appreciated.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>My Deepest, Darkest Secrets: Tell All Your Friends</i> is a coming of age story that happens in real-time. With raw, untouched excerpts from my diaries, I reflect on the lessons I’m learning while growing up in a messy, chaotic, fascinating, and silly world.<br/><br/>My name is Kelly Wiesehan and I am the author of <i>My Deepest, Darkest Secrets: Tell All Your Friends</i>. I wrote this book because I have diary entries from the last ten years of my life, and it seems unfair to keep these tokens of universal truth to myself. I want to share these intimate thoughts with anyone else who’s in the middle of growing up and wondering what the hell is going on, and doing their best to figure it all out.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a power to own your mistakes and move forward with a ferocious intention about who you want to be. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to explore the facets of friendship and heartbreak; as an escape from the notion that you have to fit into a mould; to laugh about embarrassing, cringeworthy moments, and learn alongside myself about the importance of reflection, taking risks, intentional relationships, and exploring who you are while you start to claim space in this big world.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of identity, heartbreak, and friendship through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transitioning from a sheltered high school environment to a worldly, diverse university and learning to open my mind to other approaches to life</li>
<li>Moving to a new city and ending a long term relationship that forced me to confront my values and priorities</li>
<li>Reflecting on past and present friendships and learning what it means to be a good friend and bring wonderful people into my life</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are trying to figure this shit out. And by “shit” I mean: high school, college, friends, boyfriends, parents, God, tequila (in that order), and how to have a good ass time while trying to learn what kind of person you want to be.<br/><br/><i>My Deepest, Darkest Secrets </i>speaks to young women and people in their early twenties who want to grapple with learning to own their eccentricities and take risks in order to grow in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>My Deepest, Darkest Secrets</i> inspires reflection and meaningful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p><i>What do we want and how do we go after it with zest and passion?</i></p>
<p><i>What behaviors contribute to an intentional, healthy friendship?</i></p>
<p><i>How can you recover from heartbreak in an empowering, exploratory way?</i></p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the importance of reflection, honoring our evolution, and learning to laugh at ourselves will elevate all of our paths.</p>
<h2>The Book - <i>My Deepest, Darkest Secrets: Tell All Your Friends</i>
</h2>
</div><div>
<p>The book is written in 4 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the author’s note + chapters 1-5. In these chapters, the reader will learn about where I grew up, my lively family dynamic, going to Catholic high school in St. Louis, how I got involved in improv, and my journey to being accepted into a Top 20 university. Part 1 lets readers get to know me and where I come from, and serves as a great foreshadowing to the rest of my story.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>contains chapters 6-9. These stories explore my transition into college, landing my dream internship at NBC, living in New York City, and the ending of my nearly four year relationship. This part is interesting because while my childhood dreams were coming to fruition, my long-term relationship was slowly and painfully falling apart.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 10-12. What I find silly about most movies, books, and TV shows is that they usually end with a “happily ever after” or “the break up.” Well, in life, our movie doesn’t stop. We have to keep going. And this part dives into how I’m pulling myself together after a terrible break up with a boyfriend and friends.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapters 13-15. The last part brings us seemingly full circle with important lessons I’ve learned, my experience with Covid-19, and wraps up my evolution with an acknowledgment of the growth that has happened over years of journaling about growing up.</p>

We see this as a place for people who excel at taking risks, who thrive under pressure - for people whose words and rhythms are <em>spry</em>.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough money to host and fund the development of a website that is worthy of featuring the work of the writers who submit to and read Spry.

<p><em> </em></p></span></div>","We envision Spry as a literary journal that features undiscovered and established writers' concise, experimental, hybrid, modern, vintage or just plain vulnerable writing. We see this as a place for people who excel at taking risks, who thrive under pressure - for people whose words and rhythms are spry.
Our goal is to raise enough money to host and fund the development of a website that is worthy of featuring the work of the writers who submit to and read Spry. The quoted price of our web development, including hosting and other labors, comes out to $600. We're hoping to raise at least $500 to help us get Spry online, so we can help brilliant writers ignite and inspire in all kinds of ways. To help Spry grow, we want to build it an attractive, easily navigable home -- and to do that, we are hoping for your help. Any help! $1, $5, $50 - if you can spare it, we will be eternally grateful. Even if you can't, just helping us spread the word about Spry would mean so much!
If you're interested in submitting your writing for the first issue of Spry Literary Journal, please visit http://sprylit.submittable.com/submit to review the guidelines and submit your work.
Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and look at our Indiegogo.
Write boldly!
-Erin and Linsey

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Have you ever been accused of something you didn't do? Of course you have. Was it an accusation that completely changed your life? Were you left doubting your core beliefs? Did you expect to get your life back? I did. I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Teacher's Terror</em></strong> is a true story of just such a situation. It's not a book I want to write. It's a book I <strong><em>need</em></strong> to write. Not just for me, but also for every teacher out there that believes it couldn't happen to them.</p>
<p>This book will chronicle the past three years of my life. It's a true story of deceit, betrayal, apathy, political corruption, and greed. I'll take you to the deepest, darkest parts of my depression and how this has changed forever how I see the world.</p>
<p>I've lost everything. Every resource has been exhausted. Before long, I will lose my home. What I have not lost is my self-respect and the knowledge that I’ve done nothing wrong and the comfort of supporting friends and family. So I've decided it’s time to tell my story publicly. But I need your help.</p>
<p>The book will have to be self-published. But it <strong><em>needs</em></strong> to be published. The publishing fees and associated costs start at about $3000, so that's my goal - to raise enough for a first printing.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Matthew Rowe. I've been working as a teacher for 5 years, and I'm in my 4th year here in Japan. I’m also an independent author with two highly praised books available in stores. The great thing about that is that I made them myself, from scratch. I even chopped down the trees and jumped up and down on them until they turned into pulp to make the paper. No really, I can show you the residue on my boots!</p>
<p>I tasked my 2<sup>nd</sup> grade students with the goal of writing reviews of their favourite parts of Japanese culture to put into a book and publish it. The difficult part being, it’s in English! Despite the usual initial shock and a bonus smattering of disbelief that the book would be published at all, they have performed wonderfully. Their reviews are finished and raring to go. I just have to format them into a handy book shape, with an aim to release the book in January.</p>
<p>Not only that but I told them, and it is no lie, that all profits will go to help local victims of last year’s earthquake who are still rebuilding their lives.</p>
<p>I gave my second grade high schoolers this project, with it's lofty goals, for so many reasons.</p>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>I wanted to use my expertise in lessons to do something no one else could do.</li>
<li>Something different for the students is something fun, and they seriously need fun!</li>
<li>Students get to write about something they are passionate about.</li>
<li>They can help people all over the world learn about their country.</li>
<li>They can show the school and the Board of Education that it’s okay to try something different (or rather, I can! Mwuahahaha!).</li>
<li>They can help local earthquake victims with the profits they make from the book.</li>
<li>They can see that even a learner's English can have a big impact.</li>
<li>They get to work together to produce a tangible record (and great memory) of their achievement to treasure for the rest of their lives.</li>
</ol><p>This book can do so much, but only if it is seen and read by many people. So, that’s where you come in. Your small contribution could bring a smile, confidence, better education and improved quality of life for people here in Japan..</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ほしいものは</strong><strong>? (What We Need)</strong></p>
<p>So where will our money go? Well, we are asking for $1,999 USD. It's a nice psychological trick to make people go ""oh, it's less than $2,000!""</p>
<p>This is what it will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Printing costs:</strong> It's $3 a book and we want an initial run of 500 books! So that's $1,500 already! ふっふ～</li>
<li>
<strong>Global Distribution:</strong> $100</li>
<li>
<strong>Shipping to Japan</strong>:$3 a book. So another $1,500, because we have to get our hands on the books to be able to sign them for you! And to give to local schools, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cover Illustration:</strong> $200 because it’s darn good.</li>
<li>
<strong>Indiegogo fees:</strong> 4% if we meet our goal, 9% if we don't.</li>
<li>
<strong>Apologetic meal for my girlfriend, for spending so much time working on this project and not with her:</strong> $50</li>
</ul><p><strong>TOTAL </strong><strong>＝</strong><strong>$3,350 + fees</strong></p>
<p>We are going to do our best to contribute ourselves of course, but the school isn't rich and neither am I. So here we are asking for your help towards this. We're aiming to pay for initial shipping costs (and I'll pay for my girlfriend's meal of course!) but the printing costs will come directly out of our profit.</p>
<p>We want to give as much as possible to charity, so if we reach our goal, we can have a strong initial run and kickstart our charity effort. If we fail, then this will be just another writing exercise for the students, but we can order a few copies of the book in a slow trickle. However, we won't be able to gift books to the local community, students who contributed and backers. So the project will lose most of its impact! It would be like Godzilla if he were suddenly the size of a real lizard. At least the book will be out there! </p>
<p>Should the kami-sama (gods) smile on us and we raise above our target, that money will go directly to our charity and the local people who need it. It will rebuild houses, shops and communities. It will buy school supplies. It will pay for repairs and the ongoing clean-up operation. It will get long suffering peoples’ lives back to normal.</p>

<p><strong>プレゼントを上げるよ！　</strong><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>What? Satisfaction that you are helping to change the world, improve lives and rescue the needy isn't enough for you? Don't worry. I am just playing with you. I know how important this is and we are all super grateful that you would even look at this page (or consider tweeting about it? Hint! Hint!) so anyone who contributes actual, real, honest spendable cash will receive some lovely thank you gifts that I hope express the depths of our thanks.</p>
<p>All backers will get their name listed in a special ‘Thank You’ section of the book, but you could also get an exclusive e-book version of the final product with bonus illustrations, personal thank you cards from students, signed copies of the book, original, one of a kind pictures drawn for the book by students, the chance to include your own illustrations in the final print and....well, I can’t promise anything but I would just love to offer a personal, expenses paid tour of Sendai city and our school (flight and hotel paid for, that is), but that could only happen if someone backed us way beyond our target!... ahem. What was that? Oh I said nothing.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>インパクト</strong>! <strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Living and working in Japan is crazy, fun and sometimes really frustrating. Do you remember in school when you had those lessons where the teacher just droned on and on? ""Bueller? Anyone? Anyone?"" It was about a boring subject, and all the students could do was try and stay awake long enough to write down some notes that might be important in the test later on. You know the type. We've all been there. Well, Japanese lessons are like that <strong>all </strong>the time. The teacher speaks, students fill in blanks on a worksheet. Lesson ends! There’s no fun! There’s no creativity! There’s no will to live!</p>
<p>Then along comes gangly, slightly nutty, but not harmful to your allergies, me and I bring some fun activities for my students to do and they stare at them like they are nuns in a roadies bar. Poor souls. They’ve forgotten what it’s like to... um… what was I talking about?</p>
<p><img alt=""Typing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://machuusensei.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/20120913-213307.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Typing""/></p>
<p>The students in Japan are in so much trouble and they don't even know it. They don't know how to express themselves, they don't know how to think creatively, they don't have any break from the pressure placed upon them by society and their parents at their school, they don't have any fun and they certainly don't have any confidence!</p>
<p>Also, as I am sure you are aware, last year, Japan suffered a terrible disaster of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown. I was here. It was a terrifying time for everybody. Just 3km from our school, everything was swept away. Tens of thousands of people lost their lives and hundreds of thousands have lost everything else. Loved ones have died or been injured, homes have been destroyed, jobs lost and with it any safety and security for the future.</p>
<p><img alt=""tsunami"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://machuusensei.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/20120605-211806.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""tsunami""/></p>
<p>The disaster disappeared from the news in a few days, but over 18 months later, here in Japan it's still a huge part of peoples' lives. Many still live in temporary homes after long periods being homeless or sheltering in school halls; towns are barren; schools are just starting to stock all their needed supplies; and no one knows what effect the radiation will have in the future... </p>
<p>In short, there are many people who still need help. My students know this because they are all, at the very least, familiar with someone who has lost so much. So, I suggested that money raised from our project, the sale of this book, be donated to help local people recover from the disaster.</p>
<p>If you help us reach our goal we can achieve all this and so much more. The book is already written. It just needs some editing and it is ready to go to the printers. However, the self publishing service is a strange concept here in Japan, so local printing is out of the question. We want to use Amazon's Createspace service to publish our book as it would also give us better exposure. With your money, we can get an initial run of books to students, local schools, libraries and you, the backers. So then, word of our project can spread.</p>
<p><img alt=""Photo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://china.usc.edu/App_Images//cc-kids-relief-small.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Photo by 23hours""/></p>
<p>The more people who know about our project and its huge success, the more good we can do. Money raised will help disaster victims on their way; the success will show the Board of Education that we know what we are doing, teachers will gain confidence and try new ideas and bigger projects with even greater benefits, but most of all the students will gain some confidence in their English and in themselves, because right now, they have no idea that their imperfect English could do <strong>anything</strong> except cause embarrassment.</p>
<p><em>Photo (right) ©23hours, two boys play in the cramped conditions of temporary housing in Miyagi prefecture.</em></p>
<p>It's not just the students though, the teachers too need confidence in their abilities and confidence that anything other than the tried and tested (and worn out and flogged and neighing in its death throes style) lesson plans can work.</p>
<p>In short; Japanese people live in a box. I live outside the box. I want to show them its ok outside the box, but here's this nice idea that will give them some money to make their box a little better in the meantime.</p>
<p>(No more boxes! Revolution!)</p>
<p>Now, I know what you are thinking; “He’s probably going to edit the work into a shiny piece of perfection!” but the truth is I’m not. My students really are that good. The work will be published warts and all for you to read and learn from. As a bonus, for comparisons sake, I’m including my own article and I am sure you will see the difference.</p>
<p>How can you trust me?</p>
<p>Well, let’s think about the alternative, shall we? If I edit all the mistakes in their work and turn it into a perfectly publishable book (by normal standards), can you imagine how the students would feel? “That’s not my work!” will be their first thought. Disappointment, disenchantment, anger and retreat will set in. Hitler will march over all of Europe and there will be no one to stop him! Sorry, got sidetracked. They will lose confidence, not gain it and the main purpose of this project will be lost. Not to mention all the work I would have to do for that. Where as if I publish their work with mistakes, sure, they may be a little embarrassed at first, but when they see what their book achieves and how it affects lives, I think they will feel far happier than embarrassed..</p>

<p>Thank you so much! </p></div>","要旨だね (Short Summary)
Hi, I'm Matthew Rowe. I've been working as a teacher for 5 years, and I'm in my 4th year here in Japan. I’m also an independent author with two highly praised books available in stores. The great thing about that is that I made them myself, from scratch. I even chopped down the trees and jumped up and down on them until they turned into pulp to make the paper. No really, I can show you the residue on my boots!
I tasked my 2nd grade students with the goal of writing reviews of their favourite parts of Japanese culture to put into a book and publish it. The difficult part being, it’s in English! Despite the usual initial shock and a bonus smattering of disbelief that the book would be published at all, they have performed wonderfully. Their reviews are finished and raring to go. I just have to format them into a handy book shape, with an aim to release the book in January.
Not only that but I told them, and it is no lie, that all profits will go to help local victims of last year’s earthquake who are still rebuilding their lives.
I gave my second grade high schoolers this project, with it's lofty goals, for so many reasons.

I wanted to use my expertise in lessons to do something no one else could do.
Something different for the students is something fun, and they seriously need fun!
Students get to write about something they are passionate about.
They can help people all over the world learn about their country.
They can show the school and the Board of Education that it’s okay to try something different (or rather, I can! Mwuahahaha!).
They can help local earthquake victims with the profits they make from the book.
They can see that even a learner's English can have a big impact.
They get to work together to produce a tangible record (and great memory) of their achievement to treasure for the rest of their lives.
This book can do so much, but only if it is seen and read by many people. So, that’s where you come in. Your small contribution could bring a smile, confidence, better education and improved quality of life for people here in Japan..
 
 
ほしいものは? (What We Need)
So where will our money go? Well, we are asking for $1,999 USD. It's a nice psychological trick to make people go ""oh, it's less than $2,000!""
This is what it will be used for:


Printing costs: It's $3 a book and we want an initial run of 500 books! So that's $1,500 already! ふっふ～

Global Distribution: $100

Shipping to Japan:$3 a book. So another $1,500, because we have to get our hands on the books to be able to sign them for you! And to give to local schools, etc.

Cover Illustration: $200 because it’s darn good.

Indiegogo fees: 4% if we meet our goal, 9% if we don't.

Apologetic meal for my girlfriend, for spending so much time working on this project and not with her: $50
TOTAL ＝$3,350 + fees
We are going to do our best to contribute ourselves of course, but the school isn't rich and neither am I. So here we are asking for your help towards this. We're aiming to pay for initial shipping costs (and I'll pay for my girlfriend's meal of course!) but the printing costs will come directly out of our profit.
We want to give as much as possible to charity, so if we reach our goal, we can have a strong initial run and kickstart our charity effort. If we fail, then this will be just another writing exercise for the students, but we can order a few copies of the book in a slow trickle. However, we won't be able to gift books to the local community, students who contributed and backers. So the project will lose most of its impact! It would be like Godzilla if he were suddenly the size of a real lizard. At least the book will be out there! 
Should the kami-sama (gods) smile on us and we raise above our target, that money will go directly to our charity and the local people who need it. It will rebuild houses, shops and communities. It will buy school supplies. It will pay for repairs and the ongoing clean-up operation. It will get long suffering peoples’ lives back to normal.
 

プレゼントを上げるよ！　What You Get
What? Satisfaction that you are helping to change the world, improve lives and rescue the needy isn't enough for you? Don't worry. I am just playing with you. I know how important this is and we are all super grateful that you would even look at this page (or consider tweeting about it? Hint! Hint!) so anyone who contributes actual, real, honest spendable cash will receive some lovely thank you gifts that I hope express the depths of our thanks.
All backers will get their name listed in a special ‘Thank You’ section of the book, but you could also get an exclusive e-book version of the final product with bonus illustrations, personal thank you cards from students, signed copies of the book, original, one of a kind pictures drawn for the book by students, the chance to include your own illustrations in the final print and....well, I can’t promise anything but I would just love to offer a personal, expenses paid tour of Sendai city and our school (flight and hotel paid for, that is), but that could only happen if someone backed us way beyond our target!... ahem. What was that? Oh I said nothing.
 
インパクト! The Impact
Living and working in Japan is crazy, fun and sometimes really frustrating. Do you remember in school when you had those lessons where the teacher just droned on and on? ""Bueller? Anyone? Anyone?"" It was about a boring subject, and all the students could do was try and stay awake long enough to write down some notes that might be important in the test later on. You know the type. We've all been there. Well, Japanese lessons are like that all the time. The teacher speaks, students fill in blanks on a worksheet. Lesson ends! There’s no fun! There’s no creativity! There’s no will to live!
Then along comes gangly, slightly nutty, but not harmful to your allergies, me and I bring some fun activities for my students to do and they stare at them like they are nuns in a roadies bar. Poor souls. They’ve forgotten what it’s like to... um… what was I talking about?

The students in Japan are in so much trouble and they don't even know it. They don't know how to express themselves, they don't know how to think creatively, they don't have any break from the pressure placed upon them by society and their parents at their school, they don't have any fun and they certainly don't have any confidence!
Also, as I am sure you are aware, last year, Japan suffered a terrible disaster of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown. I was here. It was a terrifying time for everybody.

But I was determined and I began to interview my family members about the years building up to independence in 1994. What I discovered shifted all of my original premises. Shangaan people are relatively recent immigrants into the country. Their ethnic identity was formed by the Swiss missionaries’ obsession with grouping territorially and, later, by the Apartheid government’s version of ‘divide and conquer.’ It was then manipulated by puppet African leaders to appeal to and unite their Bantustan subjects during the Apartheid era which is why it appealed most to the scattered, newly-arrived Shangaans.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A dying history</h3>
<p>                    This story is excluded from the official history of mass allegiance with the ANC, however it matches with what scholars such as Isak Neihaus have written about other ethnic groups in rural Transvaal. Ethnic construction is the story of South Africa and Shangaan identity demonstrates it clearly. Writers like Mahmood Mamdhani discuss the Shangaan experience briefly when discussing the broader South African context but their story remains untold because the rural region has remained poor and has not produced any noted historians and scholars. This is why I want to go back this summer to interview the Shangaan people of Hlangani before they are written out of history. I will spend three months doing cultural and life history interviews with various villagers. I hope to achieve triangulation by interviewing people with varying perspectives on and roles in the anti-apartheid movement in order to get as full a picture of the area’s struggle as possible. I will then compare and contrast my findings with those of historians and sociologists to assemble a rural version of the South African liberation struggle<a href=""#_ftn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[2]</a>  and then make links to how it affects the region today.            </p>
<h3>The big picture...</h3>
<p>          This research is integral for my proposed self-designed major called African Solutions, the final product of which will be a blueprint for the grassroots development organization that I intend to start after I graduate and return to Shirley Village. And I will publish and archive my findings. Since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/mayawegerif"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my reputation as a poet</a> is growing steadily, I will write and film a series of poems about my observations while I am there. These will be shared throughout the semester to conscientize my campus. On a personal level the trip will help me find out more about my identity and assess whether my post-college plan is feasible. The research and observation will help me to understand the form and the roots of the area’s grievances in order to find solutions; local, sustainable, African solutions.</p>

<p>In the weeks and months that followed Iceland's catastrophic economic collapse in 2008, commentators noted that Reykjavik was something of a ""Canary in the Coalmine."" Iceland's rapid banking implosion, they posited, made the country something of a crystal ball. Icelanders would feel the effects of the global recession faster and harder than any other country. What transpired in Iceland, they said, could be expected in much of the rest of the world shorly thereafter.</p>
<p>No one could have predicted it at the time, but things didn't really pan out this way. Pain is felt in Iceland, to be sure, but crisis stricken countries elsewhere ended up falling much harder. </p>
<p>What made the ""Canary"" observation astute, however, were political events that unfolded in the weeks following the collapse. Icelanders turned out in impressive numbers to protest the corruption, lies, and outright theft that led to them to the brink. In a sense, this foreshadowed the Occupy Movement and the anti-austerity movements that have gripped Athens, Madrid and other European cities since 2008.</p>
<p>In post-collapse Reykjavik, citizens surrounded the Althingi, Iceland's parliament, banging on pots and pans, demanding the resignation of the right wing government that had cheered as bankers ran rampant. The ""Kitchenware Revolution"" succeeded in the short term, bringing down the Independence Party -- a powerful, long-ruling Reagan/Thatcher fan club that oversaw vast privatizations. Thirty years of unapologetic neoliberal boosterism came to a grinding halt. An election followed, with protesters turned politicians winning seats in the legislature and left of center parties taking the reins of state. </p>
<p>It was an exciting time to have a dissenting voice in Iceland. Systemic economic changes proved somewhat difficult -- some would argue unnecessary -- but the country played host to a groundbreaking media/transparency reform movement. WikiLeaks activists were in Reykjavik to promote the idea, when a still relatively unknown Julian Assange obtained explosive U.S. government secrets from Bradley Manning. And a reform movement, using innovative techniques, drafted a constitution that would have significantly empowered the electorate. Things looked different. Around the world, whether deserved or not, Iceland earned a reputation as something of a brave, rebellious, nation.</p>
<p>But now, just as conservative (and reactionary) voices have remained relevant elsewhere despite the abject failure of the ideology they espouse, the momentum of those pushing alternative paradigms has slowed in Iceland. The move to rewrite the constitution hit a major snag -- the Althingi failed to approve the document's draft at a crucial moment. And an election scheduled for April 27th appears likely to usher in a return to power for politicians close to those that helped bring Iceland <a href=""http://www.grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Why-Is-The-Independence-Party-So-Popular"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to near ruination</a>.</p>
<p>So what will happen after Icelanders decide their future on the 27th? How can the election's outcome be explained? How will commentators there be reacting to the results? What will Icelanders expect in the election's aftermath? What will become of the spirit of the ""Kitchenware Revolution""? How will the canary sing this time around? This is what I hope to find out, straight from the horse's mouth -- on the ground in Reykjavik at the end of the month,</p>
<p><strong>Why me?</strong></p>
<p>I am familiar with the situation in Iceland, as I have been writing about the aftermath of the financial collapse there for over three years.  I have written <a href=""http://samueledwardsknight.wordpress.com/articles1/iceland/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nine feature length pieces</a> on the subject -- my last one, a 5,000+ word article for <a href=""http://truth-out.org/news/item/14097-with-new-constitution-post-collapse-iceland-inches-toward-direct-democracy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Truthout</a>, was ""liked"" over 4,400 times on Facebook.</p>
<p>I will leverage my contacts to get an insider's look at what is happening, and will interview countless people to get a feel for the zeitgeist. I will talk to experts -- economists, political scientists, local journalists -- and will explore the root causes of the election's outcome. </p>
<p><strong>What are you paying for?</strong></p>
<p>I can assure you that I will be doing this on a shoestring budget. Your donations will pay for airfare, expenses while I'm there (I'll be staying on friend's couches), and for general living expenses in Washington -- I will spend a significant amount of time on this project, much longer than the week or so I will spend in Iceland.

<p><b><u>A Summary</u></b></p>
<p>Greetings
all, my name is Omar Tyree, a <i>New York
Times</i> bestselling and award-winning author. I first became known in my
hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well as in Washington, DC,
Baltimore, Maryland and in New York City as a celebrated writer of contemporary
urban fiction. After self-publishing my first three books at age 23, 24 and 25
in the early 1990s, I went on to publish 14 straight novels with the publishing
house of Simon &amp; Schuster from 1995 to 2008, selling more two million
copies worldwide.</p>
<p>However,
the publishing industry has changed drastically since the 1990s and early 2000s,
and so has my writing. Many national bookstores have closed down, while ebook
technology has opened up. And after publishing more than a dozen urban American
stories; including <i>Flyy Girl</i>, <i>A Do Right Man</i>, <i>For The Love of Money</i>, <i>Just
Say No!</i> and <i>The Last Street Novel</i>—all
listed at OmarTyree.com—I realized that there was a much bigger world out there
to write impactful stories about and other ways to introduce those stories to thousands
of readers. </p>
<p>So
I created the Ebook Nation, where writers with big ideas, including novelists,
filmmakers and playwrites could all present their work—as originally
conceived—with an innovative business approach of celebrity marketing
participation. In other words, if you have a great book or film idea with
superstars like, Brad Pitt or Will Smith in mind for lead characters—and your story
ideas are good enough—the Ebook Nation will professionally edit, publish and
market them, while offering a participation agreement to Brad Pitt or Will
Smith to help market and promote the ebooks as well as to acquire the film
rights. So the bigger the ideas with international stars and reach, the better.</p>
<p>This
is the Ebook Nation, a whole new way of creating, publishing and marketing
great new stories. And with your small but monumental help, we could all kickoff
2014 with the explosive bang of New Year’s Eve energy!</p>
<p><b><u>What Is Needed?</u></b></p>
<p>In
the industry of publishing, original ebooks are nowhere near as expensive as print.
In the old-school print model, supplying a thousand books for a thousand readers
would cost thousands of dollars. But in the new-school era of ebooks, there is
no printing cost at all. Readers are able to download their desired list of books
to ebook reading devices, cutting out the cost of printing, packaging and
shipping entirely. Not to mention the cost of warehouse or storage space.</p>
<p>However,
there are still costs involved in hiring professional editors to help improve
the content. There is no shortcutting the editing process if a publisher desires
to produce quality work. There are also costs involved in graphic art design and
photography for great, eye-popping cover jackets, as well as costs involved in
online marketing to promote the work. </p>
<p>So
we calculated a very small, start-up budget of $20,000 which would allow us to
employ several quality editors, several innovative graphic designers and key
online marketing experts. Once thousands of ebook readers grow to love our
books, our brand, our website and our upcoming list of new titles at
EbookNationInc.com, the company would quickly capitalize itself in the absence
of expensive overheads. </p>
<p><b><u>What Is The Impact?</u></b></p>
<p>Ultimately,
the impact of the Ebook Nation Inc. company will be all about the books and the
execution of our innovative model. Presently, we have started the Fall 2013 launch
with four Omar Tyree novels, including “The Traveler” series as a new-wave
“James Bond” vehicle and an international thriller. <i>The</i> <i>Fast &amp; The Furious</i>
film star, Paul Walker, won our reader survey at TheTravelerBooks.com last year.
The majority of our readers viewed Paul Walker as an ideal lead for international
hero “Gary Stevens” in the <i>No Turning
Back</i> prequel as well as the upcoming <i>Welcome
to Dubai</i> to be published in December.</p>

Ebook Nation. Wake up! We just found a loophole in the Matrix! So spread the

<br/><p></p></span></div>","A Summary
Greetings
all, my name is Omar Tyree, a New York
Times bestselling and award-winning author. I first became known in my
hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well as in Washington, DC,
Baltimore, Maryland and in New York City as a celebrated writer of contemporary
urban fiction. After self-publishing my first three books at age 23, 24 and 25
in the early 1990s, I went on to publish 14 straight novels with the publishing
house of Simon & Schuster from 1995 to 2008, selling more two million
copies worldwide.
However,
the publishing industry has changed drastically since the 1990s and early 2000s,
and so has my writing. Many national bookstores have closed down, while ebook
technology has opened up. And after publishing more than a dozen urban American
stories; including Flyy Girl, A Do Right Man, For The Love of Money, Just
Say No! and The Last Street Novel—all
listed at OmarTyree.com—I realized that there was a much bigger world out there
to write impactful stories about and other ways to introduce those stories to thousands
of readers. 
So
I created the Ebook Nation, where writers with big ideas, including novelists,
filmmakers and playwrites could all present their work—as originally
conceived—with an innovative business approach of celebrity marketing
participation. In other words, if you have a great book or film idea with
superstars like, Brad Pitt or Will Smith in mind for lead characters—and your story
ideas are good enough—the Ebook Nation will professionally edit, publish and
market them, while offering a participation agreement to Brad Pitt or Will
Smith to help market and promote the ebooks as well as to acquire the film
rights. So the bigger the ideas with international stars and reach, the better.
This
is the Ebook Nation, a whole new way of creating, publishing and marketing
great new stories. And with your small but monumental help, we could all kickoff
2014 with the explosive bang of New Year’s Eve energy!
What Is Needed?
In
the industry of publishing, original ebooks are nowhere near as expensive as print.
In the old-school print model, supplying a thousand books for a thousand readers
would cost thousands of dollars. But in the new-school era of ebooks, there is
no printing cost at all. Readers are able to download their desired list of books
to ebook reading devices, cutting out the cost of printing, packaging and
shipping entirely. Not to mention the cost of warehouse or storage space.
However,
there are still costs involved in hiring professional editors to help improve
the content. There is no shortcutting the editing process if a publisher desires
to produce quality work. There are also costs involved in graphic art design and
photography for great, eye-popping cover jackets, as well as costs involved in
online marketing to promote the work. 
So
we calculated a very small, start-up budget of $20,000 which would allow us to
employ several quality editors, several innovative graphic designers and key
online marketing experts. Once thousands of ebook readers grow to love our
books, our brand, our website and our upcoming list of new titles at
EbookNationInc.com, the company would quickly capitalize itself in the absence
of expensive overheads. 
What Is The Impact?
Ultimately,
the impact of the Ebook Nation Inc. company will be all about the books and the
execution of our innovative model. Presently, we have started the Fall 2013 launch
with four Omar Tyree novels, including “The Traveler” series as a new-wave
“James Bond” vehicle and an international thriller. The Fast & The Furious
film star, Paul Walker, won our reader survey at TheTravelerBooks.com last year.
The majority of our readers viewed Paul Walker as an ideal lead for international
hero “Gary Stevens” in the No Turning
Back prequel as well as the upcoming Welcome
to Dubai to be published in December.
In
November, the Ebook Nation launches The

icon, Justin Bieber. In September, Psychadelic,
a music-inspired road comedy film idea—with several musician cameos in mind, including
rapper/actor Common—was novelized and released as an ebook. The title is
presently for sale for all ebook devices and agreements remain open for celebrity
participation in marketing as well as for film rigts. 
With
25 published books in 21 years, including six original ebooks and more titles
in the works, I am very qualified to run a successful publishing company. I’ve
earned 21 years of publishing known-how. We now look forward to a small helping

<p>Thirteen years ago, I finished the first draft of <i>Natural Consequences</i>.  With some enthusiastic encouragement from a few manuscript readers, I picked a half-dozen literary agencies in New York and wrote each a thoughtful query.  </p>
<p>The morning is bright and the air is crisp. At the post office, I take a deep breath and flip through my envelopes one last time. Dropping them into the mail slot, I get a little shiver down my spine. As unceremonious as this act was, it made me feel like a real author -- and I smiled a bit.</p>
<p> “There’s no reason lucky stars can’t shine on me too,” I think while driving toward my office.</p>
<p>The cell phone rings – it’s my wife.  “Are you listening to the news”? </p>
<p>“No… why?” I ask.</p>
<p>“A plane just crashed into the World Trade Center,” she replied.</p>
<p>I drove on to work, concerned from hearing the news. My colleagues and I are standing around a television in the conference room, discussing how such a thing could have happened, speculating how difficult it was going to be to extinguish the fire, wondering how long it might take to repair the building.</p>
<p>Then, as we watched, another plane flies out of nowhere and smashes through the second tower. </p>
<p>We all stop chatting. No desire for speculation. It is crystal clear what is happening, and we all scatter silently to ponder our private thoughts.</p>
<p>There is no comparison of tragedies to be made here. Obviously, the loss for those involved and to our country was staggering; the painful scars remain even today. That I chose that day not only to launch my dreams, but to launch them right into the physical heart of that horror was not lost on me.</p>
<p>I did not expect any responses, but after a few months at least two agencies replied with apologies – though none were expected or necessary. That my book would seem at all relevant or interesting to anyone in America seemed unlikely and unimportant.</p>
<p>Now that thirteen years have passed, I have been thinking again how much I enjoy telling stories. My job is writing computer software, which I have done now for more than thirty years.  Honestly, I do not enjoy writing software -- never dreamed of becoming a software writer, and frankly I am weary of doing it.  </p>
<p>I am a storyteller. I want to write books. I want people to read my books.</p>
<p>Of course, now I am old -- certainly a lot older than I was in 2001. Sometimes computers get to a point where they require a reboot to get things working again. This old man needs a reboot as well, and that is why I am asking for your help.<br/><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>I set the goal for this campaign pretty low, because if you do not reach the goal, then the funding organization takes a lot more of a percentage of the funds raised. If the goal is reached, then the fee drops from 9% to 4% -- and that can be a significant difference.</p>
<p>What I truly hope, is that you will get behind this ""Reboot the Old Man"" effort, and that the $1000 goal will be eclipsed in a spectacular manner. Any amount raised, even if the goal is not fully reached will help me, so rest assured that gratitude does not hinge on the spectacular.</p>
<p>The primary goal is to finish some rewrites and quality editing of the book I set out to publish more than a decade ago. It is finished, and even in its current form it reads pretty well -- still, I want to give it some updates and corrections to match what has changed in the world since it was written.</p>
<p>There is zero danger that Natural Consequences will not be finished and published. Everyone who contributes at any level will receive a 100% off coupon to obtain the book in one of (hopefully) several eBook formats. I plan to do this through the online publishing service called Smashwords. My hope, depending somewhat on the amount of support received, is to have the book available in December of this year.</p>
<p>The other books, should you choose to help me at a higher level, will one day be finished.  You can ""vote"" for which one comes next by selecting the appropriate perk/contribution level.  The story with the most contribution votes will be the story I finish next, and it will most likely be available around the middle of next year.</p>
<p>My goal is to complete a story in roughly six months.</p>
<p>If you participate at the higher ""story-vote"" level -- then you will receive a 100% off coupon for ALL of these stories as they are completed, including the first one by the end of this year.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In a dream of dreams, my job would be to wake up every day to write. There are people who get to do that, and even though it is late in this old man's life -- there has to be a chance for dreams to come true.  </p>
<p>I hope over time, people will discover that my stories are good and my writing style is enjoyable and comfortable. When that happens, I believe that my dreams can hold their own -- but if enough support comes through this campaign, I can devote more time and mental energy to the effort, increasing the chances for long term success.</p>
<p>The incredible hope, honestly, is that some kind of record could be set by participants in this ""Old Man Reboot"" campaign. If enough of you contribute, and spread the word -- the results could be incredibly miraculous.</p>
<p>Why not make this an extra challenge -- take this campaign to a level never imagined possible. That would be awesome for my dreams, and the added dimension of making fundraising history could be fun as well.</p>
<p>Just a thought... a dreamer's dream.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As I noted before, there is no risk that Natural Consequences will not be published, and virtually no risk that it will not be published before the year's end. There are pressures associated with the work that I do, and lingering challenges that resulted from a rather long period of being unemployed. These are the things that will slow me down, and make it difficult to finish all of the stories. I hope that folks will really get behind me and eliminate the financial distractions. </p>
<p>Finishing the stories and publishing them electronically does not depend on fund-raising success.  Allowing my mind to focus on storytelling is at risk if the fund-raising falls too short.</p>

The Stories


Natural Consequences A fictional tale about an odd weather phenomenon that forms over a rural portion of Nebraska. The story weaves its way through an interesting cast of characters who must confront the growing threat. This book is finished, but is in a re-write and editing phase.



Sizzlers Have you ever heard of Spontaneous Human Combustion? If it really happens, it certainly is quite rare. Google it if you never have heard of it! What if suddenly everyone begins hearing of Spontaneous Human Combustion? What if becomes very un-rare?



My Ghost Do you talk to yourself in the car or while you are walking and no one is around?  If you asked yourself a question, and you got a ""real"" answer -- from the back seat, or from behind you, would you find that ""odd""?  Scary?

The Haunted One Presidents get a lot of advice, and a lot of people watch over them, but when something un-seen by anyone else, begins to visit the President, and make demands, the President becomes a little bit unpredictable. How should the Secret Service deal with that? Hmmm...

<p><i>Healthcare of a Thousand Slights</i><br/>This book seeks to better understand the root causes of health disparities among marginalized communities in the United States by looking back at policies and culture that have helped shape and create those disparities.<br/><br/>My name is Anjana Sreedhar and I am the author of Healthcare of a Thousand Slights. I wrote this book because it is essential to talk about the true root causes of health disparities among marginalized communities (people of color, women, LGBTQ+ community members, and others), and how intrinsically those disparities are connected to the social and economic systems in which people live. More importantly, it is these critical understandings that will draw us to develop more inclusive, integrated solutions to mitigate these health disparities.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how deeply rooted health disparities are in the history of how different communities have been treated in the United States. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for health disparities among marginalized communities in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you have a more nuanced understanding of the health disparities facing marginalized communities and what opportunities exist to make things better.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about health disparities and systemic injustice and discrimination:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the legacies of policies such as forced relocation, slavery and segregation, and xenophobic immigration policies impacted not just the trajectories of these communities, but also the healthcare they received</li>
<li>how movements for civil rights propelled better healthcare provision for different communities</li>
<li>how incorporating social determinants of health and leveraging technology responsibly can indeed mitigate health disparities for vulnerable populations</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you care deeply about the future of health outcomes for marginalized communities, if you want a deeper understanding of how different systems in the United States function to allow for certain people to have certain healthcare outcomes, and if you are curious about how to improve the quality of life for Americans of color, female-identifying Americans, rural Americans, poor Americans, and LGBTQ+ Americans.<br/><br/>Healthcare of a Thousand Slights is a non-fiction book that speaks to young people in the public health space and those who seek to better understand why different populations have different health outcomes who are looking at health disparities and the history of fighting for civil rights for the first time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book: Healthcare of a Thousand Slights</h3>
<p>The book is written in 5 parts....<br/><br/>Part 1: Those Who Were First contains the introduction + the health outcomes and histories of some of America’s earliest residents: Native Americans and Black people. You will learn about the ways in which the United States federal government interacted with these populations over history, ultimately impacting their health access up until today. You will read about researcher Melissa Ojibwe, who shares how traditional farming and hunting practices were disrupted by forced relocation, resulting in a decline in Native American health outcomes; you will also read about Dr. Mary Bassett, who was one of the first to bring #BlackLivesMatter to the forefront of medicine.<br/><br/>Part 2: Those Who Came Later contains chapters detailing the history of the migration of Latine Americans and Asian Americans. I interviewed people like reproductive health justice advocate, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, about the unique challenges of Latine Americans in accessing reproductive and general healthcare, while also getting insights from researchers, such as Dr. Stella Yi of NYU Langone Health’s Center for the Study of Asian American Health, about the challenges of the model minority myth on the health of lower-income Asian Americans.<br/><br/>Part 3: Those Who Have Been Forgotten highlights the healthcare challenges faced by poor and rural Americans. While the narratives of these Americans has often been left out of mainstream media and academic conversation, I am excited to share that I’ve had the chance to learn from author Linda Tirado, who brought the struggles of poor Americans to the forefront with her book and from researchers at the Bipartisan Policy Center for sharing key reforms that would improve health outcomes for rural Americans.<br/><br/>Part 4: Bringing Past Movements to the Fore highlights the healthcare challenges faced by American women and LGBTQ+ people. In the 1960s, women’s liberation and LGBTQ+ rights movements were coming to the forefront; what I seek to do is highlight the effects of those movements on the health outcomes on these populations.<br/><br/>Part 5: An Ode To COVID-19 and Moving Forward is highly topical, including technology and policy solutions designed to mitigate health disparities. Given the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of racial injustice in national conversations due to the murder of George Floyd, I have included some interviews from frontline workers and analysis on the future of healthcare for marginalized communities with racial injustice in mind.</p>

<p>My name is Jonas Lee. I'm an Indie author who has already published a recent novel, A Time to Reap. This campaign is an effort to get its sequel out by the time the first book starts receiving traction. As a new author, I am basically invisible until I can get my foot in the door.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Satisfying Our Needs<br/>
</h3> <p>This is an effort to get publishing costs covered and marketing funds underway. So, yes, I need your money, BUT I will give you things in return. I'm not just a charity case. I'm looking to reach at least $2500 dollars. This will cover the following:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Editing <br/>
</li>
<li>Formatting <br/>
</li>
<li>Cover Art</li>
<li>Branding</li>
<li>Fundraising Costs</li>
</ul>
<p>And with your donation, I will give you the option of various perks for helping me out. It can go to something as simple as a public thank you to signed copies of books. I can show up for a book club or have the option of becoming a name WITHIN the new book!!</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that not everyone will be able to donate what they wish they could. I get it, we don't all have money to dish out at any given time. So, in the unlikely case I don't meet the full goal, I will still be using what is raised for the essential things first. Cover art is a must. If any of you liked the first cover, I want to carry that awesomeness over. Then the technical side to make the mistakes of my existence pretty much disappear. <br/></p>
<p>The plus side... If I raise more than what the base goal is, the branding cost will go straight into marketing and I will get something for everyone. Not ruining the surprise yet. Don't want to jinx it. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Antsy Pants<br/>
</h3> <p>This project is crucial for getting the sequel up and running. Not to say it won't happen in time, but who wants to wait for an additional 4-8 months to find out what Carter &amp; Mo are up to??</p>
<p>As an Indie author, I love creating the story I want to tell and giving it to an audience. I have no publishing house, unfortunately, so I must do all of these things out of my own pocket. Sales from the first book will get there, but not for another four months or so. <br/></p>
<p>Writing is my dream, I'm living it and breathing it in daily. My waking world is still a full-time job, a family and a daughter who loves to be involved in sports. So many friends and family have already helped me live this dream in so many ways, I just don't want to wake up from it yet. Help me hit the Snooze button a little longer, would you?<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Junk Punch <br/>
</h3>This is a section (title renamed of course) Indie Go-Go adds to keep a transparency on what might come up. Truly, nothing will stop this from becoming a reality. Granted, if I can't raise enough funds, it will be slower. <br/><br/>Beyond that, the book is done. I just finished it a couple days ago. No wondering when I'll get around to it. Literally, from fundraising I'll be setting up appointments to get things rolling. <br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Athithtance <br/>

It's available on Kindle, Nook, Kobo and in Paperback through CreateSpace. <br/><br/>And if you made it this far and still aren't convinced in letting go of that burning money, I'd appreciate it if you could spread the word to friends and family across all your social media.

<h3>Que?</h3>
<p><strong>Viúvas de vivos e de mortos</strong> é unha desas novela que invitan a continuar lendo, ofrecendo contrastes e desenvolvendo novas tramas e conflictos a medida que as súas protagonistas tratan de resolver os seus problemas... de vivir as súas vidas.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Dous vellos mariñeiros atopan o cadáver dun home aboiando nas augas do peirao de pasaxeiros de Moaña. Un intrigante suceso que vai quebrar a forzada tranquilidade dos anos da posguerra da pequena vila mariñeira, traendo consigo unha cadea de sorprendentes revelacións que van alterar a vida dos seus habitantes.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Especialmente a triste vida de Penélope. Penélope Laura. Laura <i>A tola</i>, viúva de vivo.</p>
<h3>Quen?</h3>
<p><strong>Do Peirao</strong> é unha editorial con vontade de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionais pero de incuestionable calidade, con novas e refrescantes ideas como é o empregar unha campaña preventa para valorar a aceptación e viabilidade de cada título.</p>
<p>Deste xeito es ti, agora que te estás expondo como colaborar, o que decide se a obra que che presentamos verá a luz pasando a formar parte do noso catálogo... porque consideramos ao lector parte fundamental do proceso.</p>
<p>Hoxe preséntasenos <strong>Serafín Parcero</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacín un nun caloroso 25 de xullo, o de 1955, no lugar da Praia, en Moaña. Gradueime en Profesorado de EXB na Escola Universitaria de Formación do Profesorado de EXB de Pontevedra. O meu primeiro destino como mestre foi o C.P. Reibón, en Moaña. Logo desenvolvín o meu labor docente en diversos centros educativos da provincia de Pontevedra. Dende moi novo participei de modo activo na vida social, cultural e deportiva da miña vila natal. Tamén dende novo me sentín atraído pola creación artística, en especial polo debuxo e a escrita. As influencias da miña profesión leváronme cara o conto e o teatro para nenos.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">No ano 2000 abracei con ilusión un subxénero literario que antes nunca profanara: o microrrelato. Un amor —creo que mutuo— que segue vivo e dando os seus froitos. Ese ano, un dos meus microrrelatos, o que leva por título «Contrabando» foi merecedor do primeiro premio no Certame de Microrrelatos convocado pola Lonxa Literaria de Moaña. Ese mesmo ano, o conto da miña autoría «O verán no que Manolo Escobar veu actuar nas festas do Cristo» foi, igualmente, merecedor do primeiro premio de Narracións Breves convocado pola AA VV Nós, de San Pedro de Darbo. Volvín presentar unha obra a ese mesmo certame, desta vez na edición do 2004, sendo merecedor, novamente, do máximo galardón coa miña obra <i>Aconteceu nun outono que se negaba a selo.</i> No ano 2008  gañei o Certame de Relatos de Muller ""Matilde Bares""<strong>,</strong> convocado polo CIM do Concello de Bueu coa obra <i>Ollos de cinsa</i> (esgotada a primeira edición). A finais do ano 2016 rematei a miña novela <i>Insulae Deorum </i>e presenteina ao Concurso de Novela Torreste Ballester. A convocatoria dese ano bateu todos os récords de participación, cun total de 101 novelas na modalidade de lingua galega. De entre elas o xurado escolleu 18 finalistas, entre as que estaba a miña obra. Obra que editei e que está a acadar recoñecemento entre os lectores.</p>

<h3>Por que?</h3>
<p>Por aquí un fragmento do texto como mostra:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Baixou do barco de pasaxe e, xa nas escadas do peirao, volveu botar man do paquete do tabaco. Fretou con enerxía un mixto contra do rugoso lateral da diminuta caixa de cartón, e cando achegaba a pequena candea ao cigarro, albiscou algo que chamou a súa atención naquela lámina de prata escura coa que a incipiente luz do día tapizaba as remansadas augas superficiais do peirao. Coa man que o cigarro deixaba libre turrou daquel cabo que, mediante un sinxelo sistema de nó escorregadizo debería achegar a embarcación onda el, máis a embarcación, trancada, negábase teimuda ao solicitado desprazamento. O seu corazón detivo o compasado latexar cando albiscou, enleado entre os cabos do bote e os dunha chalana que estaba fondeada fronte das escaleiras de ferro do peirao, un vulto informe. Aínda que a súa vista non era, nin moito menos a de antano, por causa do glaucoma recentemente diagnosticado e que galopaba sen control cara a unha paulatina e inexorable perda do seu campo visual, enseguida se fixo unha idea certeira da natureza daquel obxecto que, aboiando entre augas, impedía que a vella embarcación se achegase ao peirao con facilidade.<br/>          O corazón, súbita e brevemente pausado, recuperou o palpitar, agora cunha rapidez e intensidade fóra do común, a causa dunha idea tan tola como efémera: o mar quería devolverlle aquilo que lle arrincara con tanta crueldade, o mar desexaba tornáballe a parte mortal do seu fillo querido para que, por fin, puidera repousar en terreo sagrado.<br/>          Aquela amarga, mais, á súa vez, reconfortante ilusión durou escasos segundos, os suficientes para deixalo embargado nunha tristura e nun desacougo profundos».</p>
<h3>Como?</h3>
<p>Para arrincar o proxecto fixámonos como obxectivo 880€; esta é a cantidade que recadariamos se ao redor de cincuenta mecenas se fixesen, cada cal, cun exemplar desta primeira edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tendo acceso ás galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibindo un exemplar semanas antes da saída ao mercado da obra.</li>
<li>Aínda que, tamén poderías ver o teu nome nos agradecementos achegando un pouco máis.</li>

</div></div>","Que?
Viúvas de vivos e de mortos é unha desas novela que invitan a continuar lendo, ofrecendo contrastes e desenvolvendo novas tramas e conflictos a medida que as súas protagonistas tratan de resolver os seus problemas... de vivir as súas vidas.
Dous vellos mariñeiros atopan o cadáver dun home aboiando nas augas do peirao de pasaxeiros de Moaña. Un intrigante suceso que vai quebrar a forzada tranquilidade dos anos da posguerra da pequena vila mariñeira, traendo consigo unha cadea de sorprendentes revelacións que van alterar a vida dos seus habitantes.
Especialmente a triste vida de Penélope. Penélope Laura. Laura A tola, viúva de vivo.
Quen?
Do Peirao é unha editorial con vontade de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionais pero de incuestionable calidade, con novas e refrescantes ideas como é o empregar unha campaña preventa para valorar a aceptación e viabilidade de cada título.
Deste xeito es ti, agora que te estás expondo como colaborar, o que decide se a obra que che presentamos verá a luz pasando a formar parte do noso catálogo... porque consideramos ao lector parte fundamental do proceso.
Hoxe preséntasenos Serafín Parcero.
Nacín un nun caloroso 25 de xullo, o de 1955, no lugar da Praia, en Moaña. Gradueime en Profesorado de EXB na Escola Universitaria de Formación do Profesorado de EXB de Pontevedra. O meu primeiro destino como mestre foi o C.P. Reibón, en Moaña. Logo desenvolvín o meu labor docente en diversos centros educativos da provincia de Pontevedra. Dende moi novo participei de modo activo na vida social, cultural e deportiva da miña vila natal. Tamén dende novo me sentín atraído pola creación artística, en especial polo debuxo e a escrita. As influencias da miña profesión leváronme cara o conto e o teatro para nenos.
No ano 2000 abracei con ilusión un subxénero literario que antes nunca profanara: o microrrelato. Un amor —creo que mutuo— que segue vivo e dando os seus froitos. Ese ano, un dos meus microrrelatos, o que leva por título «Contrabando» foi merecedor do primeiro premio no Certame de Microrrelatos convocado pola Lonxa Literaria de Moaña. Ese mesmo ano, o conto da miña autoría «O verán no que Manolo Escobar veu actuar nas festas do Cristo» foi, igualmente, merecedor do primeiro premio de Narracións Breves convocado pola AA VV Nós, de San Pedro de Darbo. Volvín presentar unha obra a ese mesmo certame, desta vez na edición do 2004, sendo merecedor, novamente, do máximo galardón coa miña obra Aconteceu nun outono que se negaba a selo. No ano 2008  gañei o Certame de Relatos de Muller ""Matilde Bares"", convocado polo CIM do Concello de Bueu coa obra Ollos de cinsa (esgotada a primeira edición). A finais do ano 2016 rematei a miña novela Insulae Deorum e presenteina ao Concurso de Novela Torreste Ballester. A convocatoria dese ano bateu todos os récords de participación, cun total de 101 novelas na modalidade de lingua galega. De entre elas o xurado escolleu 18 finalistas, entre as que estaba a miña obra. Obra que editei e que está a acadar recoñecemento entre os lectores.
Se desexades coñecer máis da miña obra, podedes visitar a miña páxina literaria: www.bicebersa.com
Por que?
Por aquí un fragmento do texto como mostra:
«Baixou do barco de pasaxe e, xa nas escadas do peirao, volveu botar man do paquete do tabaco. Fretou con enerxía un mixto contra do rugoso lateral da diminuta caixa de cartón, e cando achegaba a pequena candea ao cigarro, albiscou algo que chamou a súa atención naquela lámina de prata escura coa que a incipiente luz do día tapizaba as remansadas augas superficiais do peirao. Coa man que o cigarro deixaba libre turrou daquel cabo que, mediante un sinxelo sistema de nó escorregadizo debería achegar a embarcación onda el, máis a embarcación, trancada, negábase teimuda ao solicitado desprazamento. O seu corazón detivo o compasado latexar cando albiscou, enleado entre os cabos do bote e os dunha chalana que estaba fondeada fronte das escaleiras de ferro do peirao, un vulto informe. Aínda que a súa vista non era, nin moito menos a de antano, por causa do glaucoma recentemente diagnosticado e que galopaba sen control cara a unha paulatina e inexorable perda do seu campo visual, enseguida se fixo unha idea certeira da natureza daquel obxecto que, aboiando entre augas, impedía que a vella embarcación se achegase ao peirao con facilidade.          O corazón, súbita e brevemente pausado, recuperou o palpitar, agora cunha rapidez e intensidade fóra do común, a causa dunha idea tan tola como efémera: o mar quería devolverlle aquilo que lle arrincara con tanta crueldade, o mar desexaba tornáballe a parte mortal do seu fillo querido para que, por fin, puidera repousar en terreo sagrado.          Aquela amarga, mais, á súa vez, reconfortante ilusión durou escasos segundos, os suficientes para deixalo embargado nunha tristura e nun desacougo profundos».
Como?
Para arrincar o proxecto fixámonos como obxectivo 880€; esta é a cantidade que recadariamos se ao redor de cincuenta mecenas se fixesen, cada cal, cun exemplar desta primeira edición.

Tendo acceso ás galeradas de edición.
Recibindo un exemplar semanas antes da saída ao mercado da obra.
Aínda que, tamén poderías ver o teu nome nos agradecementos achegando un pouco máis.

Ademais...
Sabemos que son tempos difíciles, tamén nós os sufrimos, e é posible que non esteas en disposición de apoiarnos co teu mecenado nestes momentos... pero agardamos que se isto te chegou á alma, mesmo se talvez coñeces en persoa ao autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-orella... ) para que academos a nosa meta e Serafín Parcero vexa publicada a súa obra.
Grazas polo voso tempo.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is juju angeles and I am a poet, a student, an educator, a subsidized printer, an activist, and a mother. I have taught and read all around New York. I have volunteered my time with several organizations, including NY2NO, an organization that works in the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans. I was also on Brave New Voices NY slam team, and taped for HBO's Def Poetry. In 2009, I founded Zion Imprints. </p>
<p>I just finished my junior year in my Creative Writing program at Purchase College and I was recently accepted to join Vona Voices, which gives me the chance to study with Ruth Forman and other writers-of-color.  This is a nice change of pace for me because Vona Voices is an organization that provides workshop space for writers- of-color to explore their voice, style and culture in an understanding environment. This year Vona Voices is hosted at UC Berkley in California. </p>
<p>Although, I learned a lot this past semester at Purchase's program, I also lacked the guidance as a writer and as a cultural being. I often felt out of place and misrepresented. This concerns me because I am working on a manuscript of poems for my Senior Project, which I need in order to graduate and which will be graded by my program. I generated a lot of work this past year and I want to take the best of that batch and present it to another audience, the audience I am often talking to in my work.  </p>
<p>I am also applying to MFA programs in Poetry and I envision this chance as a way to explore my poetry in a supportive environment so as to make my writing tighter and therefore, increase my chance of getting into a graduate program.<br/></p>

</div><div>
<p>I am giver. I call myself a subsidized printer because I make chapbooks for poets at a discounted cost. I put the work in because I am a believer in the healing power of words. I am a believer in craft. And I am a believer in artist development and I try to make publishing as much of a possibility as possible. </p>
<p>Print production sometimes is too expensive for some amazing poets, so in the effort of expanding opportunity to everyone, I make chapbooks relatively cheap. I also publish poets for free through a writing contest. All of this comes out of my own pockets.</p>
<p>I want to continue this venture, I want to continue making chapbooks. Chapbooks have a wonderful history and are an affordable luxury, but I also need to write and take care of my voice, so that I can have a positive impact on my own life, my daughter's life, and my community, as well. </p>
<p>I want to use this workshop experience not only to publish my own work, but to continue to use poetry as a way to publish and teach literacy. Poetry is a powerful tool in external and internal literacy. Poetry makes connections.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know my personally, I am a single-mother in all senses of the word. Yet, I am very blessed because I pay our bills on time and I am getting an education.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">History </span><br/>
</h3><p></p><p></p><p><b>Cave Canem Foundation is a home for the many voices of African American
poetry and is committed to cultivating the artistic and professional growth of
African American poets.</b> A 501(c)(3)
non-profit service and presenting literary organization with administrative and
programming headquarters in Brooklyn, NY, Cave Canem was founded in 1996 by Toi
Derricotte and Cornelius to remedy the under-representation and isolation of
African American poets in MFA programs and writing workshops.</p>
<p>Over the past 17 years, the
organization has grown from an initial gathering of 26 poets to become an
influential movement with a renowned faculty and a high-achieving national
fellowship of 371. Cave Canem poets are influencing the literary landscape and
inspiring the genesis of such organizations as Kundiman,<span>a national organization dedicated to
the creation and cultivation of Asian American poetry,</span> and CantoMundo, which provides a space for the creation,
documentation and critical analysis of Latina/o poetry.</p>
<p>With an annual week-long writing
retreat, community based workshops, publications, nationally based readings and
Poets on Craft conversations, <b>Cave Canem
programs bring previously marginalized voices to the center of cultural
awareness and the popular imagination.</b> Cave Canem annually engages
approximately 250 writers with readings, panels and opportunities to lead
community-based workshops in New York City and Pittsburgh, which have served 600
emerging poets of color since 1999. We
partner with six prestigious presses to deliver a first-book prize (13
collections to date), a second-book prize and anthologies; together, our publications
reach a national readership of thousands.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/335091/files/20140128122521-CC10th_Great_Day_in_Manhattan.1.jpg?1390940721"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Cave Canem enjoys over 20 local, regional and national cultural
partnerships, among them the Brooklyn Book Festival, where we are a Programming
Partner; the Association of Writers and Writing Programs Conference, where we
are a Literary Partner; and five collaborative residencies at such sites as the
Millay Colony for the Arts, Vermont Studio Center and City of
Asylum/Pittsburgh. Our social media network includes over 7,440 Facebook fans
and friends, 2,846 Twitter followers, 13,420–plus YouTube views and 51,000

<p>Awards
garnered by fellows include, among many others, the Rona Jaffe Foundation
Writers’ Award, Whiting Writers' Award, NAACP Image Award, the Academy of
American Poets’ Laughlin Award, National Poetry Series Selection, Cave Canem
Poetry Prize, and Guggenheim and Ruth Lilly Fellowships. Fellows have 180+
books in print and have gained significant footholds in academic positions
around the country. Faculty member Elizabeth Alexander was named President
Obama’s Inaugural Poet in 2008; faculty members Terrance Hayes and Nikky Finney

When
you donate to Cave Canem’s Rent Party, you
help sustain the nation’s premier home for Black poetry. Your gift ensures that
the many voices of African American poets will continue to be heard.
Every year,
Cave Canem staff raises money from foundations and government sources for
programs that are transforming the literary landscape and changing individual ives: an annual retreat for 54 emerging African American poets, community
workshops that have served hundreds since 1999, the Cave Canem Poetry Prize,
New Works readings, and many more events and opportunities. Unfortunately, the
reality is that grants cover only a small percentage of overhead, including rent, the
single most challenging line item in our budget.

While the
spirit of Cave Canem is evident throughout New York City and beyond,
maintaining a centralized hub is vital to the work we do. Our headquarters in DUMBO, Brooklyn has been blessed by the presence of
poets at all career stages, and many a poem (perhaps one of yours) has been
conceived within these walls.  Our
airy loft overlooking the East River is a welcoming, safe space for workshops,
readings, research and conversations, and serves as a gallery for exhibiting visual
art. For staff, fellows, board members and volunteers, having a physical site
to plan, fundraise and prepare programs is key. Like most rental space in New
York City, however, it comes with a hefty price tag. Rent parties began in Harlem in the 1920s
when cash-strapped Uptown residents devised creative ways to pay discriminatory
rental rates on low salaries. Party hosts opened their homes, and in exchange
for a small cover charge, prepared food and provided live entertainment.
Together, party goers defeated eviction, while eating, drinking, dancing and
socializing for much less than what they’d pay for a night on the town.
Everybody won!What We Need & What You GetCave Canem’s coast-to-coast Virtual & Actual Rent Parties revive the Harlem-style rent party with poetry at its core! Join the party and help us raise $20,000 to defray our $45,000 rent bill in 2014. When you give, you will you have our deep gratitude, receive distinctive perks, and most importantly, have the satisfaction of knowing that you are making a positive difference to the future of American poetry. CCVRP - SOUTH perks include: 
""Dog Print"" acknowledgement on your facebook wall and thank you poem email. 
Poetry from southern Cave Canem fellows - shirlette ammons, Stephanie Pruitt, Remica L. Bingham-Risher, Amanda Johnston, L. Lamar Wilson, M. Ayodele Heath, Jonathan Moody, Cedric Tillman, Kwoya Fagin Maples and Bianca Spriggs. 
New music by blues funk musician shirlette ammons. 
Unique mason jars full of creative goodness. 
A limited broadside featuring new artwork by Wura-Natasha Ogunji.
Poetry over the phone from Cave Canem founder Cornelius Eady and U.S. Poet Laureate Natasha Trethewey. 
*Allow 2-3 days for delivery of $10 - 24 perks. Allow two weeks for delivery of $25 and up perks. 

History 
Cave Canem Foundation is a home for the many voices of African American
poetry and is committed to cultivating the artistic and professional growth of
African American poets. A 501(c)(3)
non-profit service and presenting literary organization with administrative and
programming headquarters in Brooklyn, NY, Cave Canem was founded in 1996 by Toi
Derricotte and Cornelius to remedy the under-representation and isolation of
African American poets in MFA programs and writing workshops.
Over the past 17 years, the
organization has grown from an initial gathering of 26 poets to become an
influential movement with a renowned faculty and a high-achieving national
fellowship of 371. Cave Canem poets are influencing the literary landscape and
inspiring the genesis of such organizations as Kundiman,a national organization dedicated to
the creation and cultivation of Asian American poetry, and CantoMundo, which provides a space for the creation,
documentation and critical analysis of Latina/o poetry.
With an annual week-long writing
retreat, community based workshops, publications, nationally based readings and
Poets on Craft conversations, Cave Canem
programs bring previously marginalized voices to the center of cultural
awareness and the popular imagination. Cave Canem annually engages
approximately 250 writers with readings, panels and opportunities to lead
community-based workshops in New York City and Pittsburgh, which have served 600
emerging poets of color since 1999. We
partner with six prestigious presses to deliver a first-book prize (13
collections to date), a second-book prize and anthologies; together, our publications
reach a national readership of thousands.Cave Canem enjoys over 20 local, regional and national cultural
partnerships, among them the Brooklyn Book Festival, where we are a Programming
Partner; the Association of Writers and Writing Programs Conference, where we
are a Literary Partner; and five collaborative residencies at such sites as the
Millay Colony for the Arts, Vermont Studio Center and City of
Asylum/Pittsburgh. Our social media network includes over 7,440 Facebook fans
and friends, 2,846 Twitter followers, 13,420–plus YouTube views and 51,000
annual website visits. 
Awards
garnered by fellows include, among many others, the Rona Jaffe Foundation
Writers’ Award, Whiting Writers' Award, NAACP Image Award, the Academy of
American Poets’ Laughlin Award, National Poetry Series Selection, Cave Canem
Poetry Prize, and Guggenheim and Ruth Lilly Fellowships. Fellows have 180+
books in print and have gained significant footholds in academic positions
around the country. Faculty member Elizabeth Alexander was named President
Obama’s Inaugural Poet in 2008; faculty members Terrance Hayes and Nikky Finney
won the National Book Award for Poetry in 2010 and 2011, respectively; 2002
Cave Canem Poetry Prize winner Tracy K. Smith received the 2012 Pulitzer Prize
for Poetry; and Natasha Trethewey, faculty member and inaugural winner of the
Cave Canem Poetry Prize, currently serves as U. S. Poet Laureate.",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

The Creole Heritage
Center
Through a series of events in the mid-1990s, a Creole
Heritage Center was developed and placed at Northwestern State University in
Natchitoches, Louisiana.  My first thought as we began was, this is
wonderful, but what IS a Creole
Heritage Center?  What are we suppose to
do??  There was no model to follow; this
was (and is) the first and only one of its kind in America.  All I knew is that it was time that our
culture received the recognition it deserves and no longer be the known as the â€œForgotten
Peopleâ€.
In its thirteen+ years of existence, the Center has served
not only the Creoles in Louisiana, but the national Creoles public, scholars,
and anyone interested in the culture from around the entire US and even other
countries.  It has paved the way for the
long sought after recognition of the unique and deserving Creole culture.  The Center has also become the national
Creole voice.   To put
it bluntly, Creoles can now be comfortable in declaring their culture and
heritage.  It is my belief that this
would not be possible without the work that the Creole Center has done.
 
Over a thousand comments were received as a part of a recent
online survey; shown below is a very small sampling:
 
The
services that the Louisiana Creole Heritage Center provides have been
invaluable in my research.   In addition,
as a genealogist and researcher of history, I cannot stress how important the

Prácticamente no existen publicaciones editadas que hablen de la historia reciente del vino de TODO el archipiélago. No entendemos de separatismos ni fronteras. Los proyectos más interesantes, los mejores vinos, tendrán cabida vengan de la isla que vengan.
Bajo el sello editorial de Pellagofio Ediciones, con una larga trayectoria en el trabajo continuo de Yuri Millares como periodista, investigador y divulgador, el criterio como sumiller de Mario Reyes con los componentes de la Asociación de Cata ""Por Narices"" y la magia en el objetivo del fotógrafo Tato Gonçalves... vamos a sacar este proyecto adelante. 
Canarias lo merece. Y con tu ayuda lo haremos posible.

<p><em>""Created in times long buried in the past, six weapons of immeasurable power were crafted in secret by those known as The Timeless Ones, created with the strongest, purest materials and each weapon imbued with the pure essence of an element.  Should one manage to gather all six weapons, they will hold the power of creation in their hands and the future of all realms will be theirs to decide.</em></p>
<p><em>For this reason, the weapons were divided among the three realms by The Timeless Ones, two weapons per realm so that they may hopefully never be united, for one that is not of divine blood should never hold such supreme power, also it was decided that a realm would not be permitted to guard a weapon that they themselves have an affinity for, as the temptation to use it may prove far too great to resist.""</em></p>

<p>It is my goal to use this project to give me the funding that I need to get volume 1 published with suitable promotion material.  Work is also underway on the Audiobook version.  Anticipated finish date for volume 1 is December 2013, with volume 2 and 3 finished in 2014 and 2015 respectively.  Work is also underway on a Collectible Card Game based around the Sphere of Eternity Universe (current completion date: TBD)</p>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><em>HOW IS PUBLISHING BEING HANDLED?</em></strong><br/></p>
<p>Paperback and Hardback publishing for the Indiegogo campaign will be done primarily through Amazon Createspace.</p>
<p><i><b>WHY DOES THE EMPOWERED SPARK PERK HAVE A DELAYED DELIVERY DATE?</b></i></p>
<p>For this tier, you are getting a separate, non-canon, not to mention UNIQUE short story based within the SoE universe that I will have to write in tandem alongside my work on the main novels.  Getting the novel out by the deadline will be my top priority, so the short stories may take a little longer, depending on demand.  The listed date is worst-case scenario, the stories will very likely be delivered MUCH sooner.<br/></p>
<p><strong><em>WHAT DO YOU NEED THE FUNDS FOR?</em><br/></strong></p>
<p>Getting a book published is not a cheap or simple task.  The majority of the funds will go towards publishing and shipping costs, with a modest sum set aside to pay the voice actors who are kindly lending their services in the audiobook.  A small portion of the funds will also go towards paying for the cover art to be developed (Sorry to say, but I am NOT good at artwork, my skills are in the field of writing.)</p>
<p><strong><em>WHO WILL BE PLAYING WHAT ROLE IN THE AUDIOBOOK?</em><br/></strong></p>
<p>This will be revealed in due time (some people have not given their full commitment yet, I don't want to say ""[voice actor] will be portraying [character]"" only to have them pull the plug on their participation.  I hope to have a couple of professional Anime (english) voice actors taking part in the project (subject to confirmation)</p>
<p><em><strong>All tiers that include paperback or hardback copies of the book are eligible to receive a Sphere of Eternity bookmark with a depiction of one of the Elemental Armaments on it for an additional $3 added to their pledge (This is additional to any bookmarks that may already be included)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR LONG-TERM GOALS FOR THIS PROJECT?</strong></em></p>
<p>Beyond completing volumes 2 and 3 of the series, I also hope to release audio book versions and large-text versions of each of the volumes for the visually impaired, plus I hope to expand out into a collectible card game and possibly even an RPG - this would require substantial financial backing to be a success however - in the vicinity of several hundred thousand dollars.<br/></p>
<p><em><strong>ARE THERE ANY STRETCH GOALS?</strong></em></p>
<p>Sure is - but you'll have to wait until we approach the goals to find out what they are!</p>

<p><strong><em>WAIT A SEC! YOU SAID THERE WOULD BE 3 VOLUMES!  WHY NO PLEDGES FOR A 3-BOOK SET?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I intend for there to ultimately be three volumes, however I do not feel it would be fair on pledgers if something were to go wrong mid-development and they be left without their rewards.  For this reason I plan to make another pledge drive as completion of Tome 2 draws nearer - this one will likely include a pledge option for all three books.<br/></p>

What happens with your support of Carmen Wright's 'Secret Realms'?     WE'VE BEEN PLANNING this project for YEARS. Our work is being crafted to create a sense of
peacefulness; to enhance introspection upon the beauty life offers all of us
amidst the chaos, reaching above and beyond into the deeper realms. 
We need your help to reach certain goals. We have plans to create some enhanced product options within the listed perks, such as stereo audio mixed with discrete
Prologic II surround sound. 
Currently we only have Dolby AC3 encoding for DVD disc authoring to create the surround sound option. If you're not big on the tech speak, the goal here is an enhanced product with standard player compatibility. We expect to create a truly immersive experience.    And with the success of the campaign, this would further allow us to use high quality duplication/replication from Disc Makers, for professionally produced products and packaging that will better ensure total compatibility. This enables a better quality product than what might come from our limited capacity on disc printing and burning capabilities. 
Some
aspects of our project will become available in the commercial market only after the
Indiegogo campaign concludes. Our supporters get them first, and these perks include some bonus materials that won't be available in the commercial release.
    HOWEVER, if we don’t reach our minimal financial goals, at the time of this writing, we have
contingencies to produce most of the advertised products in house (*Blu-ray may require some campaign support to fulfill orders.

<strong>EXTRA CONTENT ADDED...</strong><p>Having reached various stretch goals, we are pleased to confirm that EVERYONE who ordered a Special Edition Beyond Terror book package before the Campaign Deadline at any level ALSO received the following <strong>FREE BONUS CONTENT</strong>:</p>
<p>•  <strong>ILLUSTRATED DVD BOOKLET</strong> - a brand new essay discussing many aspects of Lucio Fulci trailer presentation.</p>

<h3>The Beyond Terror Collector's Edition Re-issue Campaign</h3>
<p>Acclaimed author Stephen Thrower's Beyond Terror: The Films of Lucio Fulci presented in an ALL NEW package with perks and extras galore!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Your One and Only Chance to Own the Ultimate Edition of the Ultimate Book about Lucio Fulci</h3>
<p>We asked for support in order to produce a unique one-off Special Edition of Beyond Terror with deluxe box packaging, an extra chapter and a newly commissioned Lucio Fulci Trailer DVD. This edition of Beyond Terror will never be re-issued and is vastly superior to the highstreet trade edition of the book that followed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>“The most visually spectacular, graphically arresting fantasy film book yet published in English. Beyond Terror belongs in the library of every self-respecting shock connoisseur.”</strong></i> — Fangoria</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Background to this Project</h3>
<p>Since the last pressing of Beyond Terror went Out Of Print in 2009, people have constantly been asking for a re-issue. But there's a reason this classic tome has not been available to buy for the past eight years, and that's because it's very expensive to re-issue premium quality hardcovers such as this one. We relied on <strong>YOUR HELP</strong> to raise the money for this production so we could produce a legacy publication that you’ll be proud to own and cherish for years to come.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>A Radical New Edition</h3>
<p>This is more than just a re-issue however; we have spent the past three years working with author Stephen Thrower to fully revise, update and expand Beyond Terror to take account of the intervening twenty years of research and every new discovery about Lucio Fulci and his work. In fact so much has changed compared to the first edition that we can confidently claim this is effectively a <strong>NEW BOOK</strong> that will be of great value even to those of you who already have a treasured copy of Beyond Terror in your library.</p>
<p><strong>SO MUCH MORE NEW MATERIAL:</strong></p>
<p>•  80,000 more words</p>
<p>•  128 more pages, including an extra 40 pages in full colour</p>
<p>•  350 more images</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>“I honestly can’t think of a more beautifully produced or lavishly illustrated book devoted to genre films. Beyond Terror, devoted to films of a frequently nauseating level of violence, is itself an object of great taste and beauty.”</strong></i> — Video Watchdog</p>

<p><strong>A Note About Exclusivity: </strong>The precise number of Special Edition book packages produced was dependent on the number of people who backed this campaign. We also manufactured an over-run equivalent to circa 10% of the number of backers to make sure we could comfortably cover the damages and losses that occurred. Any copies thereafter remaining are being offered for sale exclusively on the FAB Press website, but for a higher price than the Level 1 campaign pledge price, PLUS the actual cost of shipping is added for the basic package — considerably more than the £75 plus discounted shipping cost that was asked of backers who pledged to this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>“Beyond Terror is quite simply the most beautiful book on a horror subject I have ever seen. With its heavy paper stock and generous colour inserts, on looks alone this book sets a very, very high standard for genre filmographies. And genuine dedication, research and attention to detail can be found under these gorgeous wrappings.” </strong></i>— Shivers</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>New Material in this Re-issue</strong></h3>
<p>•  <strong>Full coverage of every Fulci comedy film</strong> — this section of the book has been more than doubled in size, from just 24 pages to more than 50.</p>
<p>•  <strong>New appendix</strong> — <strong>Lucio Fulci at the BBFC </strong>— the whole story of Fulci’s controversial movies, and the cuts and bans imposed on his work by the British censor.</p>
<p>•  <strong>Attack the Eye, Seduce the Ear</strong> — a brand new chapter on the music of Fulci’s movies, including the contributions of Fabio Frizzi, Ennio Morricone, Walter Rizzati and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Exclusive to the Beyond Terror Special Edition</h3>
<p>• <i><strong>Exclusive Feature 1) </strong></i> — <strong>LUCIO FULCI TRAILER SHOW</strong> — a full length DVD featuring a re-mastered collection of every known Lucio Fulci movie trailer, produced exclusively for FAB Press by Nucleus Films’ Marc Morris. All trailers are in English except where foreign language was the only option, and for all of those we have produced brand new specially commissioned English subtitles! <strong>This DVD is NTSC format, no region coding</strong>, so it can be played wherever you are in the world.</p>
<p>• <i><strong>Exclusive Feature 2) </strong></i> —<strong> EIBON COLLECTOR'S BOX PACKAGING</strong> — book and DVD housed together in a custom designed heavy duty presentation box reminiscent of the Book of Eibon from The Beyond, complete with silk pull ribbon to lift the book from the box, textured cover and magnetic closure flap.</p>
<p>• <i><strong>Exclusive Feature 3) </strong></i> — <strong>BONUS CHAPTER!</strong> — an extensive interview with Lucio Fulci...</p>
<p>This Special Edition of Beyond Terror includes a final chapter that will <strong>only ever</strong> be included here — it will <strong>NOT</strong> be in any future high street or trade edition, neither will it be in any edition offered for sale online anywhere else except direct from us… When Lucio Fulci visited the UK in 1994 as a film festival special guest, he was interviewed by renowned horror journalist John Martin. For the first time ever John has allowed that entire conversation to be published completely uncut, accompanied by rare behind the scenes shots and personal photographs of Fulci at work and at leisure. Subjects covered in this interview include:</p>
<p>•  Antonella Fulci being a student of Spanish horror and how the Templars are the perfect screen representation of fascism;</p>
<p>•  Amusing anecdotes about the problems of working with Edward G. Robinson and Patrick Magee;</p>
<p>•  The difficulties of adapting Edgar Allan Poe to the screen;</p>
<p>•  The weird world of the children in The House by the Cemetery;</p>
<p>•  Fulci’s illness, his critique of psychoanalysis and dislike of Freud, and his own abortive medical career;</p>
<p>•  Memories of Riccardo Freda and Mario Monicelli;</p>
<p>•  Fulci’s early documentaries and love of football;</p>
<p>•  The development of Italian comedies and how they influenced spaghetti westerns;</p>
<p>•  The giallo genre and Fulci’s own contributions to shaping it;</p>
<p>•  A defence of The New York Ripper;</p>
<p>•  Fulci’s reverence for Mario Bava;</p>
<p>•  Actresses Fulci has worked with (including Barbara Steele, Edwige Fenech, Elke Sommer, and Lynn Fredrick);</p>
<p>•  Plus various examples of Fulci’s legendary barbed wit.</p>
<p>• <i><strong>Exclusive Feature 4) </strong></i> —<strong> THE BEYOND WRAPAROUND BOOK JACKET</strong> —<strong> </strong> The Special Edition book itself is complete with the Zombie Flesh Eaters cover design as shown elsewhere on this page, but all Special Edition books will ALSO include the original cover design from the 1999 hardback and 2003 paperback editions included as a bonus dust jacket...</p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>“Painstaking and accurately researched, not to mention lavishly illustrated throughout, this hardback gives remarkable insight into Fulci’s work. So, either as an introduction for the uninitiated or a keepsake for the horror movie connoisseur, Beyond Terror is the definitive book on the deranged movie genius of Lucio Fulci.”</strong></i> — Kerrang!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please  remember that by pledging to crowd funding campaigns you are directly helping to support independent cult movie book publishing so we can go on to make more books about the subjects you love in the future; if you buy a standard trade edition from bookstores or any of the large online retailers instead, you are actually giving your money to them — we get very little in return from such sales, leaving less income for authors and making it very much harder for us to finance future publications. In fact the mark-ups demanded by the major online stores are at a level that means the only way we can stay in business and keep publishing books at all is due to the support of our valued customers who buy direct from FAB Press.</p>
<p>A massive thank you if you did pledge and join us in making this incredible re-issue of Beyond Terror a reality in the most spectacular high-specification packaging imaginable.</p>

This is more than just a re-issue however; we have spent the past three years working with author Stephen Thrower to fully revise, update and expand Beyond Terror to take account of the intervening twenty years of research and every new discovery about Lucio Fulci and his work. In fact so much has changed compared to the first edition that we can confidently claim this is effectively a NEW BOOK that will be of great value even to those of you who already have a treasured copy of Beyond Terror in your library.
SO MUCH MORE NEW MATERIAL:
•  80,000 more words
•  128 more pages, including an extra 40 pages in full colour
•  350 more images
 
“I honestly can’t think of a more beautifully produced or lavishly illustrated book devoted to genre films. Beyond Terror, devoted to films of a frequently nauseating level of violence, is itself an object of great taste and beauty.” — Video Watchdog
 

  “Stephen Thrower’s over-view of the movies of Italian gore-maestro Lucio Fulci is just stunning. It is clearly an important definitive work by a person who knows what he is talking about and who can put it all across superbly.” — Shivers
 

 
A Note About Exclusivity: The precise number of Special Edition book packages produced was dependent on the number of people who backed this campaign. We also manufactured an over-run equivalent to circa 10% of the number of backers to make sure we could comfortably cover the damages and losses that occurred. Any copies thereafter remaining are being offered for sale exclusively on the FAB Press website, but for a higher price than the Level 1 campaign pledge price, PLUS the actual cost of shipping is added for the basic package — considerably more than the £75 plus discounted shipping cost that was asked of backers who pledged to this campaign.
 
“Beyond Terror is quite simply the most beautiful book on a horror subject I have ever seen. With its heavy paper stock and generous colour inserts, on looks alone this book sets a very, very high standard for genre filmographies. And genuine dedication, research and attention to detail can be found under these gorgeous wrappings.” — Shivers
 

 
New Material in this Re-issue
•  Full coverage of every Fulci comedy film — this section of the book has been more than doubled in size, from just 24 pages to more than 50.
•  New appendix — Lucio Fulci at the BBFC — the whole story of Fulci’s controversial movies, and the cuts and bans imposed on his work by the British censor.
•  Attack the Eye, Seduce the Ear — a brand new chapter on the music of Fulci’s movies, including the contributions of Fabio Frizzi, Ennio Morricone, Walter Rizzati and more.
 
Exclusive to the Beyond Terror Special Edition
• Exclusive Feature 1)  — LUCIO FULCI TRAILER SHOW — a full length DVD featuring a re-mastered collection of every known Lucio Fulci movie trailer, produced exclusively for FAB Press by Nucleus Films’ Marc Morris. All trailers are in English except where foreign language was the only option, and for all of those we have produced brand new specially commissioned English subtitles! This DVD is NTSC format, no region coding, so it can be played wherever you are in the world.
• Exclusive Feature 2)  — EIBON COLLECTOR'S BOX PACKAGING — book and DVD housed together in a custom designed heavy duty presentation box reminiscent of the Book of Eibon from The Beyond, complete with silk pull ribbon to lift the book from the box, textured cover and magnetic closure flap.
• Exclusive Feature 3)  — BONUS CHAPTER! — an extensive interview with Lucio Fulci...
This Special Edition of Beyond Terror includes a final chapter that will only ever be included here — it will NOT be in any future high street or trade edition, neither will it be in any edition offered for sale online anywhere else except direct from us… When Lucio Fulci visited the UK in 1994 as a film festival special guest, he was interviewed by renowned horror journalist John Martin. For the first time ever John has allowed that entire conversation to be published completely uncut, accompanied by rare behind the scenes shots and personal photographs of Fulci at work and at leisure. Subjects covered in this interview include:
•  Antonella Fulci being a student of Spanish horror and how the Templars are the perfect screen representation of fascism;
•  Amusing anecdotes about the problems of working with Edward G. Robinson and Patrick Magee;
•  The difficulties of adapting Edgar Allan Poe to the screen;
•  The weird world of the children in The House by the Cemetery;
•  Fulci’s illness, his critique of psychoanalysis and dislike of Freud, and his own abortive medical career;
•  Memories of Riccardo Freda and Mario Monicelli;
•  Fulci’s early documentaries and love of football;
•  The development of Italian comedies and how they influenced spaghetti westerns;
•  The giallo genre and Fulci’s own contributions to shaping it;
•  A defence of The New York Ripper;
•  Fulci’s reverence for Mario Bava;
•  Actresses Fulci has worked with (including Barbara Steele, Edwige Fenech, Elke Sommer, and Lynn Fredrick);
•  Plus various examples of Fulci’s legendary barbed wit.
• Exclusive Feature 4)  — THE BEYOND WRAPAROUND BOOK JACKET —  The Special Edition book itself is complete with the Zombie Flesh Eaters cover design as shown elsewhere on this page, but all Special Edition books will ALSO include the original cover design from the 1999 hardback and 2003 paperback editions included as a bonus dust jacket...

 
“Painstaking and accurately researched, not to mention lavishly illustrated throughout, this hardback gives remarkable insight into Fulci’s work. So, either as an introduction for the uninitiated or a keepsake for the horror movie connoisseur, Beyond Terror is the definitive book on the deranged movie genius of Lucio Fulci.” — Kerrang!

 
Other Ways You Can Help
Please  remember that by pledging to crowd funding campaigns you are directly helping to support independent cult movie book publishing so we can go on to make more books about the subjects you love in the future; if you buy a standard trade edition from bookstores or any of the large online retailers instead, you are actually giving your money to them — we get very little in return from such sales, leaving less income for authors and making it very much harder for us to finance future publications. In fact the mark-ups demanded by the major online stores are at a level that means the only way we can stay in business and keep publishing books at all is due to the support of our valued customers who buy direct from FAB Press.
A massive thank you if you did pledge and join us in making this incredible re-issue of Beyond Terror a reality in the most spectacular high-specification packaging imaginable.

<p><span class=""text_exposed_show""><strong><span class=""text_exposed_show"">We met our $4000 goal, but you can still contribute! Every dollar contributed over our goal amount will go towards these workshops, to make them even more accessible! There is much work still to do! Give! Give! Please! Thanks!<br/></span></strong></span></p>
<h2><span class=""text_exposed_show""><strong><span class=""text_exposed_show"">We are the only ones who can tell our stories. And the best way to make sure our stories get told is to support each other in the telling.</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show""><strong>Got ten bucks? How about five?</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show"">I'm a writer and a smart, scrappy Philadelphian with a deep love of vegan pomegranate ice cream and fake fur collars. I'm a black feminist and a freaking queer, facts that are often reflected in my stories, which are literary, and which have won me some awards and grants, such as the Astraea Foundation Writers Fund Award and the Leeway Foundation Transformation Award. <span class=""text_exposed_show"">I have been a finalist for <em>Glimmer Train</em>'s Very Short Fiction Award.</span> I just finished a novel and have a short story forthcoming in <em>The Kenyon Review</em>. I have taught queer and women-focused community writing workshops for three years. I am the creator of Black Girl Dangerous, a revolutionary blog. I am a nerd who will correct your grammar, so watch out for that.</span></p>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show""><strong>Black Girl Dangerous</strong> is a radical literary, activist, and occasional popular culture blog where queer-identified women of color make our voices heard on the issues that interest us and affect us, where we showcase our literary and artistic talents, where we cry it out, and where we explore and express our “dangerous” sides: our biggest, boldest, craziest, weirdest, wildest selves.<br/></span></p>
<h3>The Workshops</h3>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show""><strong><em>“If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.” -- Toni Morrison</em></strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show"">I would like to offer 4-week intensive and 1-week super-intensive workshops, as well as monthly 1-day workshops, for queer, trans*, and gender-non-conforming writers of color in Oakland, Philadelphia, and Toronto, over the course of six months, beginning in July. <span class=""text_exposed_show"">We will also offer workshops online, so that writers from all over the country and the world can participate. We will workshop stories, novels, memoirs, essays, articles—whatever prose our writers are working on and need support for. Together, we will get our stories ready for the world! Each 4-week workshop will end with a reading salon where writers share some of the work they created in the workshop with our community.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show""><span class=""text_exposed_show""><strong>Workshop is essential for writers.</strong> It provides both the structure a writer needs to get the work done, and the feedback and support a writer needs to make a story great. Black Girl Dangerous Workshops are about that and much more. I am working very hard to create an environment where queer, trans*, and gender-non-conforming writers of color can feel safe and nurtured, not only in terms of creating and sharing literary work, but also sharing ourselves, our experiences, our wounds, our truths.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show""><span class=""text_exposed_show"">Because money is an issue for so many people in our community, many writers who would benefit from taking these workshops can't afford to. The workshops are priced at the minimum it takes for me to pull them off--it takes a minimum of twenty-five hours a week of my time, plus the costs of space, food, and materials. Still, the cost<span class=""text_exposed_show""><span class=""text_exposed_show"">, which is a fraction of the amount of many writing workshops in the Bay Area, Philadelphia, Toronto, and online, is too much for those of us who can only just afford to pay our rent and buy food (which is a lot of us). It is important to me to be able to provide workshops for writers who wouldn't normally be able to take them, which describes a great many of the writers of color I know. By contributing to this campaign, you will be making it possibe for more writers of color to work on their craft, in a supportive, stuctured, nurturing environment, so that we can produce exceptional stories about our exceptional experiences.</span></span><br/></span></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If I can raise $4000, I can provide six months of workshops at a reduced cost of just $15-50 each for up to <strong>76</strong> queer, trans*, and gender-non-conforming writers of color! All money raised will go towards workshop preparation, workshop space, and workshop materials (I'll pay travel and lodging costs myself). If the $4000 goal is surpassed, the extra money will go towards more workshops for more queer, trans*, and gender-non-conforming writers of color to get the structure and support they need to write and share their masterpieces!</p>
<p>Even if the entire $4000 goal isn't reached, every dollar raised will go to partial scholarships, easing the financial burden as much as possible for each writer.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a breakdown:</strong> If I can raise...</p>
<p><strong>$480</strong>, I can provide one 4-week intensive prose workshop for up to <strong>6</strong> queer and trans* writers of color.</p>
<p><strong>$1000</strong>, I can provide two 4-week intensive prose workshops and one 1-day intensive workshop for up to <strong>18</strong> queer and trans* writers of color.</p>

We are the only ones who can tell our stories. And the best way to make sure our stories get told is to support each other in the telling.
Got ten bucks? How about five?
I'm a writer and a smart, scrappy Philadelphian with a deep love of vegan pomegranate ice cream and fake fur collars. I'm a black feminist and a freaking queer, facts that are often reflected in my stories, which are literary, and which have won me some awards and grants, such as the Astraea Foundation Writers Fund Award and the Leeway Foundation Transformation Award. I have been a finalist for Glimmer Train's Very Short Fiction Award. I just finished a novel and have a short story forthcoming in The Kenyon Review. I have taught queer and women-focused community writing workshops for three years. I am the creator of Black Girl Dangerous, a revolutionary blog. I am a nerd who will correct your grammar, so watch out for that.
Black Girl Dangerous is a radical literary, activist, and occasional popular culture blog where queer-identified women of color make our voices heard on the issues that interest us and affect us, where we showcase our literary and artistic talents, where we cry it out, and where we explore and express our “dangerous” sides: our biggest, boldest, craziest, weirdest, wildest selves.
The Workshops
“If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.” -- Toni Morrison
I would like to offer 4-week intensive and 1-week super-intensive workshops, as well as monthly 1-day workshops, for queer, trans*, and gender-non-conforming writers of color in Oakland, Philadelphia, and Toronto, over the course of six months, beginning in July. We will also offer workshops online, so that writers from all over the country and the world can participate. We will workshop stories, novels, memoirs, essays, articles—whatever prose our writers are working on and need support for. Together, we will get our stories ready for the world! Each 4-week workshop will end with a reading salon where writers share some of the work they created in the workshop with our community.
Workshop is essential for writers. It provides both the structure a writer needs to get the work done, and the feedback and support a writer needs to make a story great. Black Girl Dangerous Workshops are about that and much more. I am working very hard to create an environment where queer, trans*, and gender-non-conforming writers of color can feel safe and nurtured, not only in terms of creating and sharing literary work, but also sharing ourselves, our experiences, our wounds, our truths.
Because money is an issue for so many people in our community, many writers who would benefit from taking these workshops can't afford to. The workshops are priced at the minimum it takes for me to pull them off--it takes a minimum of twenty-five hours a week of my time, plus the costs of space, food, and materials. Still, the cost, which is a fraction of the amount of many writing workshops in the Bay Area, Philadelphia, Toronto, and online, is too much for those of us who can only just afford to pay our rent and buy food (which is a lot of us). It is important to me to be able to provide workshops for writers who wouldn't normally be able to take them, which describes a great many of the writers of color I know. By contributing to this campaign, you will be making it possibe for more writers of color to work on their craft, in a supportive, stuctured, nurturing environment, so that we can produce exceptional stories about our exceptional experiences.


What We Need & What You Get
If I can raise $4000, I can provide six months of workshops at a reduced cost of just $15-50 each for up to 76 queer, trans*, and gender-non-conforming writers of color! All money raised will go towards workshop preparation, workshop space, and workshop materials (I'll pay travel and lodging costs myself). If the $4000 goal is surpassed, the extra money will go towards more workshops for more queer, trans*, and gender-non-conforming writers of color to get the structure and support they need to write and share their masterpieces!
Even if the entire $4000 goal isn't reached, every dollar raised will go to partial scholarships, easing the financial burden as much as possible for each writer.
Here's a breakdown: If I can raise...
$480, I can provide one 4-week intensive prose workshop for up to 6 queer and trans* writers of color.
$1000, I can provide two 4-week intensive prose workshops and one 1-day intensive workshop for up to 18 queer and trans* writers of color.
$1800, I can provide two 4-week intensive prose workshops, two 1-day intensives, and one week-long intensive retreat-style workshop for up to 34 queer and trans* writers of color.
$2300, I can provide three 4-week intensive prose workshops, three one-day intensives, and one week-long intensive retreat-style workshop for up to 46 queer and trans* writers of color.
$3500, I can provide four 4-week intensive prose workshops, five 1-day intensives, and one week-long intensive retreat-style workshop for up to 64 queer and trans* writers of color.
$4000, I can provide five 4-week intensive prose workshops, one week-long retreat-style workshop, and six monthly 1-day workshops for up to 76 queer and trans* writers of color.
What do you get in exchange? The warm, fuzzy feeling that comes with knowing that you have made it possible for queer, trans*, and gender-non-conforming writers of color to build community, elevate their craft, and get their stories out into the world! And perks such as:

love

I want us to move from seeing public speaking as a huge, unattainable, fear-inducing beast to an attainable, exhilarating, enriching opportunity for growth.<br/><br/>My name is Taylor Williams and I am the author of <i>Beyond the Words</i>. I wrote this book because the fear of public speaking is crippling for so many people. I have a passion for helping people find their voice and confidence in public speaking, and I know first hand how tough it can be!<br/><br/>I see public speaking as an opportunity for inner growth and connection with others - not as an invitation for embarrassment and failure. We're taught to believe that public speaking is scary and we should be afraid of it. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you can become a more confident public speaker, in whatever form that takes for you.<br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for all the various ways we can present ourselves to the world. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you gain confidence in all realms of public speaking: both for self-reflection and connecting to other human beings. I want us to learn how to laugh at ourselves a little along the way, too.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the reasons we're so terrified of public speaking and presentation, and what the antidotes to those fears are. You'll hear stories such as...</p><ul>
<li>How my friend and retired minister, Daniel, clumsily found his voice from the pulpit after someone in the congregation called him a phony.</li>
<li>How my experience as a (epically) failed athlete and model led me to improv comedy, which gave me the space to mess up, laugh at myself more, and judge myself less in high-stakes situations.</li>
<li>Why Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy deemed loneliness a national epidemic, and why public speaking can help as a means of authentic connection.</li>
<li>How my friend and journalist, Katie, uses vulnerability to tell her own stories and draw out stories from others.</li>
<li>How famed writer, speaker, and researcher Brene Brown dealt with her first TED talk going viral, when a lot of the comments on social media attacked her physical appearance.</li>

We'll discuss how Imposter Syndrome and Expert Status Backfire work against our success. And then we'll work to broaden our view of what public speaking is and can be. You'll read stories from folks I interviewed that will normalize your weeping and gnashing of teeth when you think about public speaking. (You're not alone!)<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 6-14. We'll break down the common fears around public speaking (i.e., experiencing hives or jitters before speaking or having to improvise and think on the spot) - and then we'll talk about how to work on them (i.e., building awesome routines and habits that ensure your confidence, or walking away from obsessing over writing a talk.) This is the section where we get into creating a more fruitful and fertile environment to improve our skills and confidence as public speakers. You'll read stories about my awesomely epic failures in being a performer. (Get excited!)<br/><br/>And lastly, Part 3 contains chapters 15-19. This section is about how we can use listening to be better speakers. We'll see how our attention and connection to others helps us gain skills to present ourselves more boldly. We'll talk about how empathy serves as a super power to understand motivations, values, feelings, and emotions - as a means to powerful communication. You'll read stories from stand-up comedians, ministers, journalists, and students about how they connect to others and as a result, flourish themselves.

<p>1. <strong>Support by text for teens in crisis</strong>, including counseling and referrals to partner orgs that focus on mental health, suicide, bullying, dating violence, eating disorders, rape, etc to make sure we provide best-in-class support to teens. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Leverage the data</strong> to impact communities, policy, academia, etc. (Of course, the privacy and security of the teens is our top priority.) The anonymized data can help tell clear stories about these often silent issues.</p>

Sometimes the responses might be supportive, other times self disclosure could lead to bullying online or off. What was missing was the connection with support and resources in the moment when a teen might be in pain and needing help the most. After launching and running the youth culture site Ypulse.com for several years, I decided I wanted to focus on how I could address this issue full time. I spent the last two years working at ReachOut.com, an amazing non-profit youth mental health resourced, where I heard about <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_lublin_texting_that_saves_lives.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nancy Lublin's TED talk</a>. I knew I had to get involved.</p>
<p>Quite simply, the Crisis Text line will use text messaging to connect teens with support and resources. We want to create a national (and ultimately international) infrastructure to ensure that teens can use SMS to get help 24/7. I have spent most of my career in the teen space in large part because my own teen years were especially challenging. Talking to my peers and writing in my journal only helped so much. I am passionate about the possibility of launching a service that could potentially help millions of teens through the immediacy, privacy and intimacy of texting.</p>

<div>Although she is now a reluctant, Converse-wearing “Old Person,” she gets it because, well, she did it. Armed with a $5,000 inheritance from her immigrant great grandfather at the age of 23, Nancy founded the organization Dress for Success, which to this day provides women with interview suits, career development training, and boosts in their self-confidence in more than 120 cities in ten countries. <br/><br/>Nancy graduated from Brown University, Oxford University (where she was a Marshall Scholar), and New York University School of Law.

</div></div>","Think of it like 911, but it's going to be a national text hotline.
1. Support by text for teens in crisis, including counseling and referrals to partner orgs that focus on mental health, suicide, bullying, dating violence, eating disorders, rape, etc to make sure we provide best-in-class support to teens. 
2. Leverage the data to impact communities, policy, academia, etc. (Of course, the privacy and security of the teens is our top priority.) The anonymized data can help tell clear stories about these often silent issues.
 
My name is Anastasia Goodstein and I have been creating media by, for, with and about teenagers for the past 15+ years. When I published my book, Totally Wired: What teens and tweens are really doing online back in 2007, I realized that the internet and mobile were enabling teens to express way more emotionally than they ever would in person. Sometimes the responses might be supportive, other times self disclosure could lead to bullying online or off. What was missing was the connection with support and resources in the moment when a teen might be in pain and needing help the most. After launching and running the youth culture site Ypulse.com for several years, I decided I wanted to focus on how I could address this issue full time. I spent the last two years working at ReachOut.com, an amazing non-profit youth mental health resourced, where I heard about Nancy Lublin's TED talk. I knew I had to get involved.
Quite simply, the Crisis Text line will use text messaging to connect teens with support and resources. We want to create a national (and ultimately international) infrastructure to ensure that teens can use SMS to get help 24/7. I have spent most of my career in the teen space in large part because my own teen years were especially challenging. Talking to my peers and writing in my journal only helped so much. I am passionate about the possibility of launching a service that could potentially help millions of teens through the immediacy, privacy and intimacy of texting.
By donating to this project, you will help that teen who is being bullied and feels they have no where to go. You will help the teen who is being sexually abused at home or the teen who has struggled with depression and is feeling suicidal. Your dollars could literally save lives.


We'd like to raise $15K to help fund the customization of our mobile platform so that we can connect with crisis lines across the country to answer the texts that come in.
Anyone who donates $5K will receive 2 tickets to the Do Something Awards Ceremony on August 19 in Los Angeles (airfare not included).
We also have DoSomething Tees for anyone who donates $50 (modeled by our Crisis Text Line summer intern Lindsey).
Any funds we raise will be applied towards getting this important project off the ground. Your donation to the Crisis Text Line is tax deductible under the fiscal sponsorship of DoSomething.org, a 501c3 charitable organization.




Part of the reason I signed on to help Nancy is that she has a proven track record with both Dress For Success (which she founded) and Do Something, which she has grown into the largest youth organization in the U.S.

The venture began over a decade ago when I first put it out into the ether that I wanted to (read: had to) write a pentagonia (five part series) of memoirs. I had to share the story of this girl, raised in Bushwick by two moms long before the lifestyle was discussed in the mainstream, other than to curl lips in disgust and rail about how the unnaturalness of the homosexual lifestyle. I had to share how it felt to be raised by a mentally ill parent. I had to share the story of how and why I left my mother’s home when I was thirteen and never returned. I had to share what happened to me in boarding school, when I realized that I was “the other,” the time a lit cigarette was thrown from a passing truck at me and my St. Lucian friend, followed by the words, “Nigg*s, go home.” I had to share how I ended up with a drug dealer for six years while a student at Columbia University, and how as a result of that relationship, I emotionally incarcerated myself for more than ten years in a desperate attempt to protect my heart (of course I ended up doing more damage to myself than anyone could.) But it’s in the writing that you realize all these things, and that’s what the past decade+ of writing has helped me see. It wasn’t until I went to VONA (Voices of our Nation's Arts summer writing workshops) in 2009 that I really started believing that my stories do indeed matter and should be, need to be heard. In a word, VONA gave me permission.</p>
<p>There was a time when I resisted the stories that cracked my spine, bent me over into impossible positions. I'm not that limber. There is no human who is. It's why it's taken me over a decade to work through this first memoir. I was on my knees; now I'm on my tippy toes showing the world how tall 5 feet 2 inches can be.</p>
<p>In January, after feeling stuck because I couldn’t find the thread in the dozens of stories I'd penned, something shook loose after a grueling, what-are-you-afraid-of kind of conversation. I realized that this book is about my relationship with my mother and what happened that I left at 13. Once I had that, I threw myself into memory and the page because I’m from the school of: the only way out is in. I knew the first story and I knew the last. I gathered those I had in the middle and started filling in the gaps. And that is why and how today I am now compiling the stories that surfaced in my nightly ritual writing process.</p>
<p>I can feel the book in my hands. I can see the chapters. I can feel my fingers caressing it. I can see the epigraph and the quotes that start the chapters. I can see it all, for the first time in this years-long memoir process, I can finally see the first of the pentagonia, A Dim Capacity for Wings.</p>
<p>And now I have an opportunity to have a master writer work through the book with me, help me see where it is strong and where it is weak, help me see the book in its entirety. The thing is, as a teaching artist who quit her job two years ago to work with urban youth, I cannot afford to go to VONA on my current income. I need help. And if there’s anything I’ve learned from memoir, it’s that I have to humble myself and learn to ask for help and accept it when I need it. So I need it now. And so, I’m asking that you help me raise $2000 to attend VONA.</p>
<p>The fees include $700 for the residency + $650 for housing + airfare (which last time I checked was about $550) and all the particulars like cab fare and luggage fees.</p>
<p>What do you get?</p>
<p>I’ll gladly share an excerpt of my memoir along with a public recognition (unless you choose to remain anonymous, of course) of your help.</p>

</h3></div></div>","Are you feeling exhausted by the modern worldâ€™s daily requests?Have you ever felt that the world is falling on your back?
Do you feel like there is something you can do for yourself, but you don't know what?
Does your mind continuously buzz with thought, in a flow you can't control?
Is fear an emotion you know too well?
Are you looking for quiet?


If you have answered â€œyesâ€ to any of these questions, well, we have something in common. You are not the only one to feel this way, and I am here to give you PRECIOUS information.

You were in Shanghai, living the busy expat life, and checking off a few nice ""YES"" answers to the questions above. Until you decided to search for something in particular, something that could help, something good.
 
And then you found the T'ai Shen Project, which gives the possibility to live and learn among few Buddhist monks. You gave it a chance, immediately booking a bus ticket.

In the middle of the hills behind Zaoxi, 3 hours away from the chaos of Shanghai, there is a small haven of peace: the Guang Jue Temple.

As you arrived in the town near the temple, a thin, short figure came toward you: Malcolm Hunt, the founder of the project, an Australian who facilitates the mindfulness retreats and teaches Buddhist principles, speaking with warm and quiet kindness.
 
At the temple there were only two monks, because the other five work in town in order to economically sustain the life of the monastery.

Malcolm taught meditation to you and other guests; you shared talks about life and Dharma, sipping green tea before going to sleep on the hard mattress. It was the best sleep you have ever had.

A weekend spent there gave you and other people the chance to light the first spark of a little enlightenment, that small intangible thing you needed to see clearer and take action â€“ to make better your life and the lives of others around you.


This is what happened to me. 
This could happen to you.


The aim of these retreats has been to offer an opportunity for people to come and learn a way of life that promotes supreme happiness, peace, harmony, and prosperity for all people. 
For that is what Buddhism is â€“ a Life Education.
This is vitally important work, as those who come here plant seeds of peace, harmony, and compassion within their own hearts, benefitting the peace and well-being of everyone in their circle.

Financially, it has been challenging at times to keep the retreats going: they need funds to continue spreading good seeds.

You can join this cause; you can be part of it. You can support the project with a donation, or you can simply come and be a guest!

If you feel that you would like to contribute to a greater cause, with anything, any little amount of money, you are welcome: the cost of a cocktail in Europe or US would mean incredibly a lot.

Think about your action as something good, something simply good.

With your charity you will help more people than you can imagine.

Thanks for your action,

<h3><b>NEW EARTH GIVING:    (Overview)</b></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">PHASE ONE…..BOOK (non-fiction):</b><br/></p>
<p>What is NEW EARTH GIVING?   NEW EARTH GIVING  is a dynamic and compassionate revolutionary non-fiction book, website, movement, organization,  and much, much more.    NEW EARTH GIVING the book is only stage one of a personal and global journey toward peace,  prosperity, wellness, balance, love, and abundance for all of Earth through the basic concepts of giving and gratitude.   NEW EARTH GIVING the book is a 501c3 (majority of proceeds of book will be donated to NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG) non-profit literary work (about 43 short joy to read chapters) that is designed to awaken, inspire, empower, and enlighten people as well as the world to the amazing principal of giving and gratitude and how this simple concept is the key to all of our personal, relationships,  business, economics, wildlife, and environmental transformation into a healthy holistic state of being.   Every waking moment of life can be broken down to a state or choice of giving and gratitude (or lack thereof).  It is in these choices that we learn to find the opportunity  (vs. problem or  challenge)  in any given situation.  NEW EARTH GIVING  goes further to illustrate that God/the Universe has intentionally created our world to operate upon these principals as an ever evolving  world of giving and gratitude wherein every living thing… you, me, nature, science, quantum physics, cosmos, sun, moon,  and non-living thing is playing its part.  We simply must ask ourselves some very simple questions as to if we (humans) are truly playing our part in this beautiful theater of giving and gratitude.   And if we are not…the book explores step by step chapter by chapter process’s of awakening, learning, changing, and growing into our true purpose as the caretakers of planet earth. </p>
<p>The journey of  NEW EARTH GIVING continues with the books second “part” dedicated to exploring the human “virtues” (ex. courage, will, compassion,  patience, humility, perseverance…etc….)and how they are inherently related to our role in giving and gratitude while on planet earth.  We also discover that our awareness, choices, and growth within these virtues will lead to the fastest healing of our planet as a whole as well as the most rewarding truths within our souls .  As within so without …as without so within.  NEW EARTH GIVING creates a simple and easy to comprehend picture for the reader to understand their connectivity, purpose, and overall unity of being human on earth.   Giving is redefined as “How can we truly give of ourselves?”…. followed by the question “Are we truly giving of ourselves?”.   After all it is God/the Universe’s divine design/intention (giving and gratitude)  for each individual to play their part (along with the rest of nature, earth, and the universe) by truly giving of themselves in their unique and divine manner.    NEW EARTH GIVING further explains that when we are not able to, are not willing to, are suppressed in some way, or are simply unaware of our own unique abilities to give we inherently end up “out of balance” with ourselves, our relationships, our families, our  businesses, our governments, and our earth as a whole.   NEW EARTH GIVING then asks  “What exactly is the state of our personal and global thoughts, actions, and relationships in giving and gratitude?” and “How can we empower  and transform ourselves through giving of our truest selves?""  </p>
<p>The third and final “part” of  NEW EARTH GIVING the book is a visionary look at how are outer world could be by adapting and incorporating the simple principals of giving and gratitude into our personal, family, education, science, business,  agriculture,  government,  wildlife, spirituality, environmental, community lives and more.  Step by step and category by category a new world of opportunity and possibility unfolds as NEW EARTH GIVING illuminates visionary and compassionate designs and developments  that “will” change the way we live upon our great planet earth.  The solutions and technology we seek lie deep within ourselves.  Here we also bridge the indigenous values and relationships with mother earth to how modern technologies will shape our planet in balance and harmony.  After reading this book the reader will be seeded with a feeling of  heartfelt inspiration, compassion, and empowerment while left with an optimistic understanding of “Yes it is possible to live in a world of giving and gratitude ...(balance)!”    The book further highlights an introduces NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG  the movement and non-profit organization which is the “engine” and catalyst of the entire NEW EARTH GIVING movement.  The NEW EARTH GIVING starts today.</p>
<p>NEW EARTH GIVING is not just a literary work.   It is also aims to be a creative and artistic wonder.  There will be full color images (illustrations) of inspiring  art work  (single artist, not yet decided…but some in mind …ex. Lindy Kehoe) at the beginning of each chapter coinciding with the title or theme of that chapter.    The art will capture the loving relationship between humanity and earth in all its abundance of numerous ways.    A thought provoking quote (in relationship to that chapters title) will also head the page of each new chapter (some quotes from enlightened people of past and present… and some from myself).   </p>
<p>At the end of each chapter there will be a uniquely designed journal question page.   This is not a self healing book….however it is a book of awakening and discovery.  The Journal questions are aimed to truly allow the reader take time to pause, think, and reflect about the meanings of  each chapter and how they relate to themselves as well as the world as a whole.   The journal questions also create New Earth Opportunities for the reader to literally experiment with in their everyday world.  The New Earth Giving JOURNAL may be sold with the book or separately.  Personal creativity and imagination will be encouraged throughout the boo (space provided for this in the journal as well).  </p>
<p>I have also created board game idea entitled “NEW EARTH GIVING the Game” that is based upon the concept of giving and providing global aid to all of the countries of earth based on each individual countries needs for that specific year (ex. 2014).   My goal is to launch the book, the website, and the game at the same time.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>PHASE 2.….. WEB SITE:</b></span></p>
<p>NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG is a 501c3 non-profit website dedicated to creating  one of the most efficient, democratic,  and compassionate ways of donating money to global causes, non-profits, and charities while providing the viewers/users with a creative venue to express themselves via a blog/forum as well as an “express/socail” section for literary works, art, music, health/wellness, pictures, and NEW EARTH GIVING daily moments.</p>
<p>  The website will further invite and categorize a comprehensive geographical global directory of non-profit partners, charities,  businesses,  foundations,  and “friends” of NEW EARTH GIVING.   Donations to NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG will be divided and allotted to side agendas of NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG ( Communities, Commerce, Culture, Education, Sustainability, Agriculture, Green Technology and the future affiliate site of ONESOURCEARTH.ORG).  </p>
<p>Users/individuals may also choose to donate to specific local and global non-profits and charities of the individuals/users choice via a large categorized directory.   A “donate locally” area upon the web-page will also allow users to do donate to an area of interest via an <i>Interactive Global New Earth Giving Map.</i></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> The last option of donation will be a hybrid of the previous two entitled the NEW EARTH GIVING FUND…..with this option ""members"" of the NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG non-profit co-op may donate funds and then take part in an online democracy/forum where funds will be allotted to weekly pre-chosen charities/non-profits based on the collective votes and discussion of participating members (with this option a smaller percentage of funds will automatically be applied to NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG).</span></p>
<p>The website will also aim to educate its users about its other aspects of non-profit communities,  commerce, education, agriculture, wellness, entertainment and more.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> The website will also aim to enlighten the users/individuals on the humanitarian and environmental topics of global unity and sustainability.... and how we may all play a part to help those in need.  Specific topics and areas of need/aid will be highlighted each week…..example:  world water crisis, hunger, poverty, environment…etc.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Phase 3...... Organize  Hybrid Non-profit/Co-op organization</b></p>
<p> A main priority will be to organize and incorporate as a hybrid 501c3/Subchapter T Non-profit/Co-op corporation  with an electoral board of directors and employees.   All legal manners will be finalized at this juncture including the organizations ""By-Laws"".  At this stage of development I will be keeping this simple until further backing and funding is complete. A professional business plan is in the works with the organization having a board of directors,  web/tech manager,  and marketing/publicity manager.   </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>PHASE 4.……NEW EARTH GIVING COMMUNITIES</b></p>
<p>It is NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG'S mission to also  create NEW EARTH GIVING COMMUNITIES that  will also be entirely 501c3/subchapter T non-profit/co-op in their entirety from the ground up.   These communities will be the grounding back bone and ultimate showcase of how people can live sustainable and thrive within a “giving and gratitude” based non-profit community and culture (including agriculture, education, business, commerce,  entertainment,  architecture, healthcare, and more).      These communities will also be based upon a “pay it forward” principal with portions of proceeds  from one community going to start another community.  In this same manner a brother/sister community program will be constructed abroad to help those in poverty (globally) to build and construct their own NEWEARTHGIVING Community.    People will also be able to donate or ""volunteer"" time to all aspects of the communities agendas via NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>PHASE 5.…..COMMERCE, CULTURE, ENTERTAINMENT, AND MORE</b></p>
<p>There is really no limit to the broad implications and usages of the non-profit/co-op  NEW EARTH GIVING business model.   I have developed numerous creative ideas using this model that could and would be globally transformative.  At this time I do not wish to unveil these  specific business models and entities as they will evolve in time.  For those who are donating large funds via Indiegogo.com I will offer personal emails or meetings once an agreement of non-disclosure has been signed.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.  For those who are very serious about changing the world in the fastest way possible please email me as soon as you conscience allows.  Thank You Again.</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">NEW EARTH GIVING:   Documentary Film</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>To compliment the book and website I also envision at some point in  NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG’S future creating a documentary ongoing (monthly? Quarterly? Yearly?)  web-film  that follows to live events and locations where (NEG) has donated aid, funds, and efforts.  The film would also take an ongoing look into the life at NEG Communities.  A documentary film could do what films do best …. “Create a clear picture and true connection for the general public about what is actually going on in the world and how NEWEARTHGIING.ORG is doing its part assist those in need.  </p>
<p> The best of  NEWEARTHGIVING  “personal experiences” could also be video section within the website.</p>

<p><strong>PHASE 6........Magazine</strong></p>
<p>The NEW EARTH GIVING magazine will unite and highlight many important topics similar to the website.   The magazine could include a broad range of catagories such as 1) non-profits, charities, and global aid  2) NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG NEWS and EVENTS 3)  communities and culture 3) sustainability and envrionment 4) health and wellness 5) creativity (art, writing, music, and more) 6)  green business and technology 7)  personal stories  .... and more.</p><br/><p></p>

<h1><b>MONEY AND FUNDING NEEDED</b></h1>
<p>At this moment in time I am estimating that I am about ¾  of the way through completion of my rough draft of the book.   I am estimating that it will take me about another 6 months to finish writing, organizing, editing,  illustrating,  creating the website,  creating a board of directors,  filing a 501c3,  finding the ideal publisher, and finalizing all other functions for a full launch of the organization.   I believe I am being optimistic yet realistic with this estimated time frame.   Once I have received funding I will fully utilize my god/universe given resources to streamline and network this book and organization into reality.  It is my destiny.   I have already researched much of this path via the internet and look forward to your contributions literally catalyzing and starting this long held dream in motion.     It is my life path to expand, create, and amplify the principals at hand (NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG) with networking,  connecting, and unification.  </p>
<p>Below is a list of estimated costs for Phase 1 and 2 (Book and Website).  (Phase 3 and 4 will start after 1 and 2’s completion) (estimated costs are based on internet research and some networking in the Seattle, WA area near which I am currently living)  As stated earlier I estimate to have phase 1 and 2  completed within 6 months.</p>
<p><b>1)  Editor:  </b></p>

<p>Seeking a larger publisher to publish the book and journal will be the avenue sought for publishing New Earth Giving.   This would save on upfront cost as well as create  greater market and distribution.  This is the ideal goal and pursuit of New Earth Giving.  The aim here is not about personal profit but instead about reaching a wide, numerous,  and diverse audience.</p>
<p>  <b>Self Publish (Option)</b></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>5)  501c3 legal preparation and IRS fee</b></p>
<p>Legal  501c3 preparation estimates vary. The average from my research (Seattle) runs about $500 and this does not include any further legal representation.  I will estimate a minimum of another minimum of $500 for other legal advice and services in starting a 501c3 non-profit with the capabilities and capacity of NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG. </p>
<p>IRS 501c3 registration fee = <b> $850</b></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>7)  Marketing</b></p>
<p>If self published the marketing expenses may further increase for such efforts as emarketing, travel marketing,  and other imagined marketing methods.  = <b>$10,000</b> (estimate)</p>

<h3><b>Personal Bio:</b></h3>
<p>I thought I would include a “Bio” about myself  the author, inventor, and creator of NewEarthGiving.Org.     I am a 39 yr old proud father two amazing children (6 yr old daughter and 10 yr old son).   I have worked and lived a diverse array of life experiences (College: Bio/Chem, Sales and Marketing, Website Inventor, Teaching/Instructing, Manual Labor, Bio-Dynamic Gardening and more) and have always carried a deep inner knowing that I had something great within to share with the world.  I have always viewed the earth from an eagles eye’s perspective seeing the big picture of life.  Throughout my life I have succeeded within a balance of  work, learning, inventing, art, writing, poetry, hiking, dancing, meditation, and an extreme connection and love for nature and the outdoors.   Earth (or nature) has always been my inspiration, healing retreat, and one true home.  With this I truly feel that within each and every one of us resides this calling and connection to mother earth.   More specifically I have carried this “inner knowing”  (of compassion, amplification, and expansion) over the past 10 yrs that I needed to express and share with the rest of earth.   I feel that it is part of my personal awakening journey to inspire and catalyze part of the collective awakening journey for humanity.     Divinely over the past 11 years as a father and more specifically over the past 2 years I have been humbly called  back to earth with little funds for living expenses (much of the time camping in the Forest, much of this time in service to people, and much of this time Bio-dyanamic Gardening).   I was literally uprooted in my life and taken down a different spiritual path of trusting God/the Universe as well as finding and aligning with God/the Universe within.   The theme of my life has become the theme of this book and movement- NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG.   How can I truly give of myself?   In turn how can each and every individual truly give of themselves?   My journey is humanities journey.  I am looking forward to the journey, the learning, the love, and the giving of my self along this lifelong path of New Earth Giving.   I am also greatly looking forward to working with you the contributors/donators/givers in the near future.   In uniting together we can change our world!  Even if you cannot contribute funds please pass the “word” on to friends about  New Earth Giving (and indiegogo.com)!   Sincerely, Thank You!</p>
<p><b>Rest assure  from my life experiences (both personal and professional) that I have what it takes to ""Spearhead"" the organization of NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG to success!  It is my life's passion and calling.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Whatever the human mind can conceive and believe it can achieve!</b></p>
<p>I fully believe if we create a virtual (website-organization) blueprint  of a sustainable, compassionate, and peaceful reality for the world to follow based on our own God/the Universe given intuitions, virtues, and truth of heart we could then achieve the peace, compassion, equality, sustainability we wish to see in the world.    “If we build it (virtually for all to understand) … the dream will come”.    Our thoughts and ideas become our reality.   Our putting these thoughts and ideas into physical writing confirms that their manifestation into reality has already begun.  When the tipping point of  the “collective” does the same the new reality is manifested and confirmed.   The fastest way to spread and idea aside from pure psychic thought connection with one another is though the power of the internet.   The internet is the jumpstart or spark of what then becomes a collective conscious wildfire.      Let us use this information resource (internet) in its wisest, truest, and purest of potential.  The internet is only mirroring out thoughts…. What exactly do we want to see in the mirror?  In turn the world is also mirroring our thoughts…. Again, what exactly do we want to see in the mirror?    </p>
<p>By giving of ourselves we in turn see that giving reflection created in the world around us.    Let the NEW EARTH GIVING begin!</p>

NEW EARTH GIVING:    (Overview)

PHASE ONE…..BOOK (non-fiction):
What is NEW EARTH GIVING?   NEW EARTH GIVING  is a dynamic and compassionate revolutionary non-fiction book, website, movement, organization,  and much, much more.    NEW EARTH GIVING the book is only stage one of a personal and global journey toward peace,  prosperity, wellness, balance, love, and abundance for all of Earth through the basic concepts of giving and gratitude.   NEW EARTH GIVING the book is a 501c3 (majority of proceeds of book will be donated to NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG) non-profit literary work (about 43 short joy to read chapters) that is designed to awaken, inspire, empower, and enlighten people as well as the world to the amazing principal of giving and gratitude and how this simple concept is the key to all of our personal, relationships,  business, economics, wildlife, and environmental transformation into a healthy holistic state of being.   Every waking moment of life can be broken down to a state or choice of giving and gratitude (or lack thereof).  It is in these choices that we learn to find the opportunity  (vs. problem or  challenge)  in any given situation.  NEW EARTH GIVING  goes further to illustrate that God/the Universe has intentionally created our world to operate upon these principals as an ever evolving  world of giving and gratitude wherein every living thing… you, me, nature, science, quantum physics, cosmos, sun, moon,  and non-living thing is playing its part.  We simply must ask ourselves some very simple questions as to if we (humans) are truly playing our part in this beautiful theater of giving and gratitude.   And if we are not…the book explores step by step chapter by chapter process’s of awakening, learning, changing, and growing into our true purpose as the caretakers of planet earth. 
The journey of  NEW EARTH GIVING continues with the books second “part” dedicated to exploring the human “virtues” (ex. courage, will, compassion,  patience, humility, perseverance…etc….)and how they are inherently related to our role in giving and gratitude while on planet earth.  We also discover that our awareness, choices, and growth within these virtues will lead to the fastest healing of our planet as a whole as well as the most rewarding truths within our souls .  As within so without …as without so within.  NEW EARTH GIVING creates a simple and easy to comprehend picture for the reader to understand their connectivity, purpose, and overall unity of being human on earth.   Giving is redefined as “How can we truly give of ourselves?”…. followed by the question “Are we truly giving of ourselves?”.   After all it is God/the Universe’s divine design/intention (giving and gratitude)  for each individual to play their part (along with the rest of nature, earth, and the universe) by truly giving of themselves in their unique and divine manner.    NEW EARTH GIVING further explains that when we are not able to, are not willing to, are suppressed in some way, or are simply unaware of our own unique abilities to give we inherently end up “out of balance” with ourselves, our relationships, our families, our  businesses, our governments, and our earth as a whole.   NEW EARTH GIVING then asks  “What exactly is the state of our personal and global thoughts, actions, and relationships in giving and gratitude?” and “How can we empower  and transform ourselves through giving of our truest selves?""  
The third and final “part” of  NEW EARTH GIVING the book is a visionary look at how are outer world could be by adapting and incorporating the simple principals of giving and gratitude into our personal, family, education, science, business,  agriculture,  government,  wildlife, spirituality, environmental, community lives and more.  Step by step and category by category a new world of opportunity and possibility unfolds as NEW EARTH GIVING illuminates visionary and compassionate designs and developments  that “will” change the way we live upon our great planet earth.  The solutions and technology we seek lie deep within ourselves.  Here we also bridge the indigenous values and relationships with mother earth to how modern technologies will shape our planet in balance and harmony.  After reading this book the reader will be seeded with a feeling of  heartfelt inspiration, compassion, and empowerment while left with an optimistic understanding of “Yes it is possible to live in a world of giving and gratitude ...(balance)!”    The book further highlights an introduces NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG  the movement and non-profit organization which is the “engine” and catalyst of the entire NEW EARTH GIVING movement.  The NEW EARTH GIVING starts today.
NEW EARTH GIVING is not just a literary work.   It is also aims to be a creative and artistic wonder.  There will be full color images (illustrations) of inspiring  art work  (single artist, not yet decided…but some in mind …ex. Lindy Kehoe) at the beginning of each chapter coinciding with the title or theme of that chapter.    The art will capture the loving relationship between humanity and earth in all its abundance of numerous ways.    A thought provoking quote (in relationship to that chapters title) will also head the page of each new chapter (some quotes from enlightened people of past and present… and some from myself).   
At the end of each chapter there will be a uniquely designed journal question page.   This is not a self healing book….however it is a book of awakening and discovery.  The Journal questions are aimed to truly allow the reader take time to pause, think, and reflect about the meanings of  each chapter and how they relate to themselves as well as the world as a whole.   The journal questions also create New Earth Opportunities for the reader to literally experiment with in their everyday world.  The New Earth Giving JOURNAL may be sold with the book or separately.  Personal creativity and imagination will be encouraged throughout the boo (space provided for this in the journal as well).  
I have also created board game idea entitled “NEW EARTH GIVING the Game” that is based upon the concept of giving and providing global aid to all of the countries of earth based on each individual countries needs for that specific year (ex. 2014).   My goal is to launch the book, the website, and the game at the same time.

PHASE 2.….. WEB SITE:
NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG is a 501c3 non-profit website dedicated to creating  one of the most efficient, democratic,  and compassionate ways of donating money to global causes, non-profits, and charities while providing the viewers/users with a creative venue to express themselves via a blog/forum as well as an “express/socail” section for literary works, art, music, health/wellness, pictures, and NEW EARTH GIVING daily moments.
  The website will further invite and categorize a comprehensive geographical global directory of non-profit partners, charities,  businesses,  foundations,  and “friends” of NEW EARTH GIVING.   Donations to NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG will be divided and allotted to side agendas of NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG ( Communities, Commerce, Culture, Education, Sustainability, Agriculture, Green Technology and the future affiliate site of ONESOURCEARTH.ORG).  
Users/individuals may also choose to donate to specific local and global non-profits and charities of the individuals/users choice via a large categorized directory.   A “donate locally” area upon the web-page will also allow users to do donate to an area of interest via an Interactive Global New Earth Giving Map.
 The last option of donation will be a hybrid of the previous two entitled the NEW EARTH GIVING FUND…..with this option ""members"" of the NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG non-profit co-op may donate funds and then take part in an online democracy/forum where funds will be allotted to weekly pre-chosen charities/non-profits based on the collective votes and discussion of participating members (with this option a smaller percentage of funds will automatically be applied to NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG).
The website will also aim to educate its users about its other aspects of non-profit communities,  commerce, education, agriculture, wellness, entertainment and more. The website will also aim to enlighten the users/individuals on the humanitarian and environmental topics of global unity and sustainability.... and how we may all play a part to help those in need.  Specific topics and areas of need/aid will be highlighted each week…..example:  world water crisis, hunger, poverty, environment…etc.

Phase 3...... Organize  Hybrid Non-profit/Co-op organization
 A main priority will be to organize and incorporate as a hybrid 501c3/Subchapter T Non-profit/Co-op corporation  with an electoral board of directors and employees.   All legal manners will be finalized at this juncture including the organizations ""By-Laws"".  At this stage of development I will be keeping this simple until further backing and funding is complete. A professional business plan is in the works with the organization having a board of directors,  web/tech manager,  and marketing/publicity manager.   

PHASE 4.……NEW EARTH GIVING COMMUNITIES
It is NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG'S mission to also  create NEW EARTH GIVING COMMUNITIES that  will also be entirely 501c3/subchapter T non-profit/co-op in their entirety from the ground up.   These communities will be the grounding back bone and ultimate showcase of how people can live sustainable and thrive within a “giving and gratitude” based non-profit community and culture (including agriculture, education, business, commerce,  entertainment,  architecture, healthcare, and more).      These communities will also be based upon a “pay it forward” principal with portions of proceeds  from one community going to start another community.  In this same manner a brother/sister community program will be constructed abroad to help those in poverty (globally) to build and construct their own NEWEARTHGIVING Community.    People will also be able to donate or ""volunteer"" time to all aspects of the communities agendas via NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG.  

PHASE 5.…..COMMERCE, CULTURE, ENTERTAINMENT, AND MORE
There is really no limit to the broad implications and usages of the non-profit/co-op  NEW EARTH GIVING business model.   I have developed numerous creative ideas using this model that could and would be globally transformative.  At this time I do not wish to unveil these  specific business models and entities as they will evolve in time.  For those who are donating large funds via Indiegogo.com I will offer personal emails or meetings once an agreement of non-disclosure has been signed.  Thank you for your patience and understanding.  For those who are very serious about changing the world in the fastest way possible please email me as soon as you conscience allows.  Thank You Again.
NEW EARTH GIVING:   Documentary Film

To compliment the book and website I also envision at some point in  NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG’S future creating a documentary ongoing (monthly? Quarterly? Yearly?)  web-film  that follows to live events and locations where (NEG) has donated aid, funds, and efforts.  The film would also take an ongoing look into the life at NEG Communities.  A documentary film could do what films do best …. “Create a clear picture and true connection for the general public about what is actually going on in the world and how NEWEARTHGIING.ORG is doing its part assist those in need.  
 The best of  NEWEARTHGIVING  “personal experiences” could also be video section within the website.
 
PHASE 6........Magazine
The NEW EARTH GIVING magazine will unite and highlight many important topics similar to the website.   The magazine could include a broad range of catagories such as 1) non-profits, charities, and global aid  2) NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG NEWS and EVENTS 3)  communities and culture 3) sustainability and envrionment 4) health and wellness 5) creativity (art, writing, music, and more) 6)  green business and technology 7)  personal stories  .... and more.

MONEY AND FUNDING NEEDED
At this moment in time I am estimating that I am about ¾  of the way through completion of my rough draft of the book.   I am estimating that it will take me about another 6 months to finish writing, organizing, editing,  illustrating,  creating the website,  creating a board of directors,  filing a 501c3,  finding the ideal publisher, and finalizing all other functions for a full launch of the organization.   I believe I am being optimistic yet realistic with this estimated time frame.   Once I have received funding I will fully utilize my god/universe given resources to streamline and network this book and organization into reality.  It is my destiny.   I have already researched much of this path via the internet and look forward to your contributions literally catalyzing and starting this long held dream in motion.     It is my life path to expand, create, and amplify the principals at hand (NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG) with networking,  connecting, and unification.  
Below is a list of estimated costs for Phase 1 and 2 (Book and Website).  (Phase 3 and 4 will start after 1 and 2’s completion) (estimated costs are based on internet research and some networking in the Seattle, WA area near which I am currently living)  As stated earlier I estimate to have phase 1 and 2  completed within 6 months.
1)  Editor:  
Full service start to finish and complete packaging of book start to finish and “Amazon Kindle ready” = $3500  (estimate….. adventurebooksofseattle.com)

Current artists in mind…. Lindy Kehoe,  Elance.com (multiple artists Seattle)
Self Illustrating is another option.
4) Larger Professional  Publisher (example: Redwheel/Weiser …San Francisco)
Seeking a larger publisher to publish the book and journal will be the avenue sought for publishing New Earth Giving.   This would save on upfront cost as well as create  greater market and distribution.  This is the ideal goal and pursuit of New Earth Giving.  The aim here is not about personal profit but instead about reaching a wide, numerous,  and diverse audience.
  Self Publish (Option)
Publishing 10,000 copies of the book at its lowest estimate from two different online sources (self publishin.com, booksjustbooks.com). = $10,000 
Publishing 10,000 copies of the Journal = $5,000

5)  501c3 legal preparation and IRS fee
Legal  501c3 preparation estimates vary. The average from my research (Seattle) runs about $500 and this does not include any further legal representation.  I will estimate a minimum of another minimum of $500 for other legal advice and services in starting a 501c3 non-profit with the capabilities and capacity of NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG. 
IRS 501c3 registration fee =  $850
Copyright = $35

7)  Marketing
If self published the marketing expenses may further increase for such efforts as emarketing, travel marketing,  and other imagined marketing methods.  = $10,000 (estimate)

8)  Indigogo.com 5% Fee (When Fully Successful!)  =  $871
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personal Bio:
I thought I would include a “Bio” about myself  the author, inventor, and creator of NewEarthGiving.Org.     I am a 39 yr old proud father two amazing children (6 yr old daughter and 10 yr old son).   I have worked and lived a diverse array of life experiences (College: Bio/Chem, Sales and Marketing, Website Inventor, Teaching/Instructing, Manual Labor, Bio-Dynamic Gardening and more) and have always carried a deep inner knowing that I had something great within to share with the world.  I have always viewed the earth from an eagles eye’s perspective seeing the big picture of life.  Throughout my life I have succeeded within a balance of  work, learning, inventing, art, writing, poetry, hiking, dancing, meditation, and an extreme connection and love for nature and the outdoors.   Earth (or nature) has always been my inspiration, healing retreat, and one true home.  With this I truly feel that within each and every one of us resides this calling and connection to mother earth.   More specifically I have carried this “inner knowing”  (of compassion, amplification, and expansion) over the past 10 yrs that I needed to express and share with the rest of earth.   I feel that it is part of my personal awakening journey to inspire and catalyze part of the collective awakening journey for humanity.     Divinely over the past 11 years as a father and more specifically over the past 2 years I have been humbly called  back to earth with little funds for living expenses (much of the time camping in the Forest, much of this time in service to people, and much of this time Bio-dyanamic Gardening).   I was literally uprooted in my life and taken down a different spiritual path of trusting God/the Universe as well as finding and aligning with God/the Universe within.   The theme of my life has become the theme of this book and movement- NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG.   How can I truly give of myself?   In turn how can each and every individual truly give of themselves?   My journey is humanities journey.  I am looking forward to the journey, the learning, the love, and the giving of my self along this lifelong path of New Earth Giving.   I am also greatly looking forward to working with you the contributors/donators/givers in the near future.   In uniting together we can change our world!  Even if you cannot contribute funds please pass the “word” on to friends about  New Earth Giving (and indiegogo.com)!   Sincerely, Thank You!
Rest assure  from my life experiences (both personal and professional) that I have what it takes to ""Spearhead"" the organization of NEWEARTHGIVING.ORG to success!  It is my life's passion and calling.

Whatever the human mind can conceive and believe it can achieve!
I fully believe if we create a virtual (website-organization) blueprint  of a sustainable, compassionate, and peaceful reality for the world to follow based on our own God/the Universe given intuitions, virtues, and truth of heart we could then achieve the peace, compassion, equality, sustainability we wish to see in the world.    “If we build it (virtually for all to understand) … the dream will come”.    Our thoughts and ideas become our reality.   Our putting these thoughts and ideas into physical writing confirms that their manifestation into reality has already begun.  When the tipping point of  the “collective” does the same the new reality is manifested and confirmed.   The fastest way to spread and idea aside from pure psychic thought connection with one another is though the power of the internet.   The internet is the jumpstart or spark of what then becomes a collective conscious wildfire.      Let us use this information resource (internet) in its wisest, truest, and purest of potential.  The internet is only mirroring out thoughts…. What exactly do we want to see in the mirror?  In turn the world is also mirroring our thoughts…. Again, what exactly do we want to see in the mirror?    
By giving of ourselves we in turn see that giving reflection created in the world around us.    Let the NEW EARTH GIVING begin!
Please give today!!!    Thank You!!!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hello there! I hope by now you have gotten a glimpse of the Dreamscape, and what's to come...</p>
<p>I have decided to make this project as personal as possible, going through self publishing, local printing and raising the funds to do so with the help of those who have been following me on my journey from the very beginning and hopefully newcomers who see themselves in me as well!  I really wanted to make everyone feel as though they were a part of this project, because quite frankly - you all are! I seriously would not be where I am today had it not been for all of the support, love and reassurance the digital plane (the internet/social media/etc) has gifted me over the years; this is somewhat my gift to anyone who has ever believed in me.</p>

<p>It is about coming in and out of awareness, time and time again through dreams and how we only forget when we cease to awaken and create.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<span>For the last 10 years I’ve been touring the country as an independent performance poet, social justice organizer, and as a musician with my band Prayers For Atheists.  There’s a map on my wall with over 135 thumb thumb tacks— one for almost every city I’ve performed in.  It’s been a long journey but for the first time since I started, I’m taking an extended break from the road in order to write my first book of creative non-fiction and personal essays.  These will be traveling stories, protest stories, and radical art adventures that cover everything from myself and other protesters temporarily placing three Boston police officers under citizen’s arrest for assaulting members of the crowd at the Democratic National Convention— to my DIY touring in Europe, winding through the peaks and valleys of the German-Austrian Alps in a mobile trailer home full of bohemian poets and gypsy travelers— civil disobedience outside of IMF Conferences in Washington, D.C., and traveling through most of the continental U.S. by train and bus.  It’ll also feature more humorous anecdotes like me getting chased out of the ESPN X-Games for spitting on Eminem!  Did I really spit on Eminem?  Yes, I spit on Eminem, but he was being extremely abusive to a good friend of mine at the time and I felt obligated to interject.  It’s a long story, with more details than we have time to get into here... which is why there needs to be a book!</span><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>I have a great studio to write in and all the source material I need to complete the manuscript, all I’m lacking is the financial stability to get it done.  Which is why I’m launching this campaign for a crowd funded writing residency.  With your sponsorship, I’ll be able to spend six to eight hours a day writing and editing my work, without having to constantly book shows and travel in order to stay alive.  At that rate, I believe I could have the bulk of the manuscript completed within six months.  My absolute bare bones minimum living expenses for one month are approximately $1,100.  6 month’s x $1,100 = $6,600, so, that’s what we’re aiming for.</span></p>In addition to the satisfaction of helping put a book like this out into the world, sponsors will receive a wide range of rewards in return, such as having your name listed in the official Radical Arts Sponsor page in the final book, copies of my brand new live spoken word album, limited edition signed screen print posters, and signed copies of the completed book when it’s released!  There will also be more hands-on, real time rewards like one on one writing and performance workshops (in person or via Skype), editing help with a poem or short story of the sponsor’s choice, my Top 10 Original “Jared Paul Vegan Gluten Free” cooking recipes, advanced screening of chapters and more.<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>After years of surviving as a full time independent artist, I’ve learned that DIY isn’t really Do It Yourself, it’s “do it yourself with help from people who care.”  If I didn’t have supporters throwing shows for me around the country, coming out to my events, or buying merch, then I wouldn’t have much of a career.  Which is why I put my heart, mind, and guts into every piece of art I create and each show I perform— that’s where I hold up my end of the bargain.  This crowd sourced writing residency is no different.  If you invest, not only will you be supporting independent art and helping to sponsor a superbly crafted piece of literature, you’ll be taking part in the documentation of rare and alternative perspectives into the nuts and bolts history of the modern American counter-culture experience, telling a side of the story that is, quite honestly, seldom covered.</span></p>I believe in this book with all my heart.  I’m inviting you to invest— and to become part of this collection of stories that I believe people will be reading and talking about for many years to come.<p></p>

FAQ:  ""What Type Of Stories?""
*Based on questions I've fielded at the merch booth after shows, via social media, at the National Poetry Slam, at family gatherings, and elsewhere.





Q:  Were you really there when Iraq Veterans Against War marched to the Convention Center barricades during the 2008 DNC and riot police began to resign their posts because they didn’t want to get caught attacking U.S. war veterans on camera?

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Margo Nagy.</p>
<p>I am an Author, Coach, Energy Healer &amp; Angel Healer</p>
<p>For 26 years I suffered from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(CFS), which included: paralyzing fatigue, depression, insomnia, anxiety and brain fog. At one point I almost died. I was so frustrated and depressed, a couple times I was suicidal. At times I would feel better then relapse. However, I never regained this radiant health and mental clarity that I have now. After trying everything to heal...I finally did! The key to healing CFS, depression, insomnia and anxiety is a condition called, ""Reversed Polarity"". I recently self published a book about how to heal all of this titled, <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #990099;"">""RADIANT HEALTH &amp; HAPPINESS IS POSSIBLE - How I healed from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome""</span></p>
<p>Your polarity can become reversed from trauma or stress. Then it causes static in your central nervous system. Your brain then doesn't produce Serotonin - so you become depressed, and your immune system and mind does not rejuvenate. Fortunately this can be normalized with an Herbal program or energetically. Then your body is able to heal itself!</p>
<p>I managed to self publish this book all by myself...now I need money to market and promote it, so this life changing information gets out.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the help of a professional book marketing expert I can reach more people. Then people can heal all over the world. If I don't get the money to pay for marketing and promoting experts, then this valuable information may not reach those who need it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $10,000 for a professional marketing and promotional campaign with the firm Author Marketing Experts Inc. This can be broken down such as $4,595 for a Virtual Book Tour and $1,375 for a Radio and Print Advertising Campaign, etc. These can be purchased separately.</p>
<p>I need approximately $1,000 for a professional website. I would need at least $4,000 to do a regular book tour and speaking tour.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal I will just pay for what I can. Every bit helps. If I go over my goal I will use some of that money to pay for the Herbal Program for those who can not afford to. Unfortunately there are people who can not afford the Herbal Program. With any other money left I will further invest in getting this information out.</p>

<h3>Who is River City UU?</h3>
<p>River City Unitarian Universalist (UU) Church is a newly-formed UU Church in Little Rock, AR. We began meeting a little over a year ago, and quickly picked up momentum. We now meet two Sundays each month and have an average attendance of 20 people. </p>
<ul>
<li>Since we've begun, we've double our regular attendance. Aside from the regular 20, we have another 20 people who are actively participating via Google group and Facebook.</li>
<li>We are focused on living our Unitarian Universalist Principles not just within our walls, but also in the larger community. We were thrilled to participate in Little Rock's first-ever Pride Parade this year, and have taken up a missional project with Lucie's Place. Lucie's Place (<a href=""www.luciesplace.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.luciesplace.org</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">) is a nonprofit organization created to support homeless and displaced LBGTQ persons in central Arkansas. River City UU has made and donated over 30 overnight bags (toiletries, pajama pants, etc.) to support this important work. </span>
</li>
<li>River City UU is made up of a wide variety of participants, some long-time UUs and some completely new to the Faith. We are proud to support a truly multigenerational community, with participants from four to five different generations present in worship and other activities. Whether age 5, 15, 25, or 55...all are welcome!</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we have great hopes for our emerging congregation, and we know the importance of supported Lay Leadership and connection to our District and Region, we are asking for your help!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Deets and the Perks</h3>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are seeking support to fund 3-4 people to attend the UUA Southern Region Fall Harvest Leadership Training, Nov. 8-10. This conference offers INCREDIBLE leadership training for lay leaders, about 15 hours per person of training over the weekend. Additionally, participants get to make connections with others across the Southern Region and participate in great worship experiences. (Info on the conference can be found <a href=""http://www.uusouthland.org/falltrain2013.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here!</a>)</li>
<li>Any additional funds will go to support future leadership development opportunities. We know this is a short campaign, and if we do not reach our goal we will send less people or look for another opportunity for training in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Here are the perks (the fun part):</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>ANY donation of $10 or more will designate you as one of River City UU's <b style=""font-style: italic;"">Heroes of Lay Leadership. </b>You will receive a certificate of designation. </li>
<li>For a donation of $10, you receive the certificate and a chalice bookmark featuring the artwork of Jordan Lynn Gribble (see samples <a href=""http://jlgribble.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=%2F&amp;q=bookmark"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here!</a>).</li>
<li>For a donation of $25 you receive the certificate and a set of Chalice Elements bookmarks featuring Jordan's artwork.</li>
<li>For a donation of $50 you receive the certificate and a set of 7 Principles Artwork  -prints, size 8x10 (see art <a href=""http://jlgribble.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=%2F&amp;q=uu+principle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here!</a>).</li>
<li>For a donation of $100, you will receive the certificate, a set of Chalice Elements bookmarks, and your choice of 2 8x10 matted prints (take a look at Jordan's gallery <a href=""http://theluuvre.webs.com/muuseum"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here!</a>).</li>
<li>In keeping with our rich UU history, all of the Hero levels are named after Unitarian Universalist leaders and historical figures.</li>

River City Unitarian Universalist (UU) Church is a newly-formed UU Church in Little Rock, AR. We began meeting a little over a year ago, and quickly picked up momentum. We now meet two Sundays each month and have an average attendance of 20 people. 

Since we've begun, we've double our regular attendance. Aside from the regular 20, we have another 20 people who are actively participating via Google group and Facebook.
We are focused on living our Unitarian Universalist Principles not just within our walls, but also in the larger community. We were thrilled to participate in Little Rock's first-ever Pride Parade this year, and have taken up a missional project with Lucie's Place. Lucie's Place (www.luciesplace.org) is a nonprofit organization created to support homeless and displaced LBGTQ persons in central Arkansas. River City UU has made and donated over 30 overnight bags (toiletries, pajama pants, etc.) to support this important work. 

River City UU is made up of a wide variety of participants, some long-time UUs and some completely new to the Faith. We are proud to support a truly multigenerational community, with participants from four to five different generations present in worship and other activities. Whether age 5, 15, 25, or 55...all are welcome!

Because we have great hopes for our emerging congregation, and we know the importance of supported Lay Leadership and connection to our District and Region, we are asking for your help!


The Deets and the Perks
Here are the details:

We are seeking support to fund 3-4 people to attend the UUA Southern Region Fall Harvest Leadership Training, Nov. 8-10. This conference offers INCREDIBLE leadership training for lay leaders, about 15 hours per person of training over the weekend. Additionally, participants get to make connections with others across the Southern Region and participate in great worship experiences. (Info on the conference can be found here!)
Any additional funds will go to support future leadership development opportunities. We know this is a short campaign, and if we do not reach our goal we will send less people or look for another opportunity for training in the future.

Here are the perks (the fun part):


ANY donation of $10 or more will designate you as one of River City UU's Heroes of Lay Leadership. You will receive a certificate of designation. 
For a donation of $10, you receive the certificate and a chalice bookmark featuring the artwork of Jordan Lynn Gribble (see samples here!).
For a donation of $25 you receive the certificate and a set of Chalice Elements bookmarks featuring Jordan's artwork.
For a donation of $50 you receive the certificate and a set of 7 Principles Artwork  -prints, size 8x10 (see art here!).
For a donation of $100, you will receive the certificate, a set of Chalice Elements bookmarks, and your choice of 2 8x10 matted prints (take a look at Jordan's gallery here!).
In keeping with our rich UU history, all of the Hero levels are named after Unitarian Universalist leaders and historical figures.

Heroes Make a Difference
It is crucial to the health and vitality of a congregation to support leadership development. The UUA Southern Region offers amazing opportunities for leadership development.

Supporting lay leadership in an emerging congregation supports Unitarian Universalism and growth.
Growing leaders helps the congregation grow so that we can give back to our community, to the larger UU movement, to our Region, and to the UUA.
We have very few congregations in this area, and connection with other UUs is enlightening and joyful!
