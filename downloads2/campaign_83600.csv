<h1><b>What Is The Spirit of Yorkville?</b></h1></b></h3>
<p>While most of Toronto's colourful Victorian buildings that once stood as testament to this spirit and
housed the Yorkville Village life are gone, the spirit remains and is a treasure we are going to
celebrate with a Festival every year, beginning<b> May 22/23 2015, here in
Toronto. This date commemorates Toronto's first Love-In at Queen's Park (pictured above) in May 1967 when 5,000 people joined together for love and peace.</b> Buffy Sainte-Marie and Leonard Cohen sang that day, and many of Toronto's unique young artists joined them, to celebrate that never to be forgotten <i><b>Summer of Love.</b></i></p>

<h3>

How You Can Feel The Spirit and Join The Fun</h3>
<p>Whether you remember the spirit of Yorkville
because you were a part of it or you just want to hear some great music and vibrant poetry - or just hang out in a room full of happy people, come and <b>join
us in May and be able to say, ""I was there at the first Spirit of
Yorkville Festival.""</b></p>

at <i>The Pilot Tavern</i><b>.</b> <b>(EARLY BIRD tickets 25% off until April 30 now available at spiritofyorkville.com)</b></p>
<p>The Pilot represents the last club standing from the days
between 1962 and 1972, when thousands of young people poured onto Yorkville
Avenue every weekend to listen to poetry and dance to local musicians: Luke and the Apostles, Kensington Market, Nucleus, Cathy Young, The Paupers, Ugly Ducklings, Edward Bear  and more.  Many of the early artists went on to establish international reputations. Joni Mitchell, Neil Young,
David Clayton-Thomas, John Kay, Goldie McJohn, Gordon Lightfoot, Bruce Cockburn, Dan Hill, Murray MacLaughlan and dozens more troubadours of the day were joined by Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and others from
around the world, right here in Toronto. </p>

</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Each recital costs money to startup (hall rental, insurance ...), 
ranging from hundreds to higher. However, usually much more gets donated 
by the concertgoers and much awareness is raised with the promotion, making it worthwhile. The Rescue Music Foundation
 would help cover the startup cost and associated expenses of concerts 
by young musicians, while the concert donations go to help the local 
rescue squads (or other worthy charity causes, as approved by 
the Foundation).</p>
<p>The first $4000 will go to setup cost (incorporation and non-profit status etc) and first year expense (like tax prep) of the Foundation itself. Then $6000-8000 goes to funding around 8-10 community concerts. The rest will go to help build a professional website, and promote the Foundation through social media campaigns - we need to let the kids and communities know there's a foundation to help them! <br/></p>
<p>Ideally, I hope to raise a lot more than the current goal of $15000, because the promotion and website cost could be expensive but necessary in the first years. Also any additional amount raised will help create more and a sustainable series of concerts, and possibly allow donation to rescue squads and other worthy charitable causes directly by the Foundation.<br/></p>
<p>If the campaign ends up not reaching my goal, the funds actually raised will first go to setting up the Foundation. Funding community concerts will be done based on how much is raised. Promotion will be the lowest priority - without funds for it I might simply rely on word-of-mouth and social media in friend circles.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Most people didn't realize that their local rescue squads are 
all-volunteers (except for some states) and need donations/fundraisers to
 maintain their daily operations, which are usually provided for free yet absolutely critical to the well being of so many communities. Most kids also don't have access to classical music concerts or understand why one would spend so much effort learning classical music or any music well. <br/></p>
<p>The Rescue Music Foundation combines the goals of help them out. It will help kids become more caring, thoughtful, hard-working and confident through preparing, promoting for the concert, performing in the concert, and knowing that their hard work lends great help to the community. Thus it will help out the local rescue squads, all the while helping to spread beautiful music. There will be an emphasis on classical music as I myself is an classical musician and will be able to help out to some of these concerts through my reputation and performances. However, I envision a mixed styled concert acceptable to the Foundation as well.</p>
<p>As I noted, I had raised thousands through my <a href=""http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/08/nj_teen_pianist_sensation_to_perform_to_raise_funds_for_hometown_volunteer_rescue_squad.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Rescue Music""</a> and <a href=""http://charlie-liu.com/blog/?p=763"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">other benefit solo recitals</a> and <a href=""http://ya4haiti.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">benefit events</a>. I have seen the enthusiasm of the communities for good music, to help good causes. A lot of the young musicians would like to help their communities out, but they need someone/organization to help organize, fund, and point the way. That is what the Rescue Music Foundation is about.<br/></p>
<p>Once again, if you love your community, if you love music or if you believe kids are the future of this country, please fund my campaign!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>From my own experience, the challenges of the concerts would be to get the word out. With enthusiastic young performers and their families, and given the fact (based on my own experience) that local newspapers are eager to help out spreading the word for a great cause, I do not see this as a big problem and I believe the concerts will be successful once set up.</p>
<p>The real challenge for the Foundation is to get the word about itself out, other than enough and/or continued fundraising. To overcome this, I will rely on my network, your help and your network, and hopefully a larger amount raised so the Foundation could hire professional help to get the word out in the first years.</p>
<p>Once the word is out about the Foundation helping, I am certain there will be enough children and good causes applying for Foundation's help, and the Foundation can selectively help out the most worthy and trustworthy ones. I do plan to get help from friends to volunteer for the Foundation, thereby keeping the Foundation's own expense to a minimum.<br/> </p>

Salt Lake City, UT; Eastern Montana; Boise, ID; North Nevada; Tucson, AZ; and Las Vegas, NV are some of the cites in this region who have acclaimed The Commission as ""The Hip Hop music we want on the radio"". Harnessing their love of old Italian Mobster stories, The Commission imaged themselves as a super organized hip hop tandem of talented MC's coming together to break through and survive common struggle. The group prides on putting out great music that uplifts peoples moods, makes them dance, and recites the choruses in their everyday. One secretary from Texas sent a email saying she was ""just singing 'Remember' all day in the office."" When you engage The Commission's music you reminace when hip hop was a genre that was simply about enjoyment and having a good time more than about degrading women and talking about the newest car. This key asset to the group has attracted one of the most wide array of fans to performances you will ever see. You will see the standard 20 - 30 year old at The Commission show as well as a 55 year old grandma singing along. They have been one of the most sought after, not paid for spot, opening acts in the region by national acts because of this attribute. </p>
<p><strong>Why the Commission?</strong></p><p>A theory to this, we believe, could be their strong down to earth mentality to the world. ""Realistically humble"", was the word used in publications written about them. All 3 members have been through troubling pasts ranging from incarceration, to drunken abusive homes, to selling drugs to make ends meat. However one thing changed all that. The adoption of family life. All three members stay grounded raising children they refuse to allow to go through those same negative experience. ""We were supposed to be the so called 'next generation' yet the figures in our life didn't supply the example we should have seen."" They were able to vent that through music to which  enticed people of all walks of life. The negativity stayed where its suppose to be. In the  art of music! The Commission all support &amp; raise their families, 40+ hour a week jobs, and still contribute to produce music &amp; performing. 'Humble!' The best word to describe this individual character, music, and presence.  ""We want to entertain and tell a story that people can relate. Blood sweat and tears is metaphorical and literal trials we have invested to create this music for fans."" says The Commission. They are now just asking for the chance to inspire more fans just like you. reverbnation.com/commission801</p>
<p><strong>What is the Funding for?</strong></p><p>You can view the recognitions  of this perserverant group below; but to the point.  The Commission are asking for the funds to aid in spreading their music to markets that will embrace their music.  Just a few pre-fielded markets are L.A., San Diego, Oakland/Bay Area, Seattle, Portland, Dallas, Alburqurque, Miami, Orlando, and more.  About 20+ with more regions being qualified. </p><p>They played by the rules, they used conventional means, they paid every talent manager to help them get ahead, and rubbed all the ""right"" shoulders.  But they see now that the talley of success they have accrued thus far only came from rubbing elbows with one group of people.  The Fans! The Commission will engage the only people that have the real clout to determine their success.  You the fans past, present, and future!</p><p> We, The Commission's exposure &amp; management team, have created a highly effective digitial/ground campaign strategy to penetrate these markets and expose this quality, harmonious, unique brand of hip hop to the masses in this tour.  The breakdown will be (20 markets/over 6 - 8 months):
</p><p>- $6500 for Social Media/Online Push that will garner a opening introduction and continuous brand recognition to these markets</p>
<p>- $8000 to execute a customized ""Industry"" campaign including ""Taster Days"" to the DJ's, radio stations, and hip hop music afficianados in these markets and partners in sub markets to see key endorsements</p>
<p>- $30k - $40k for ground teams for grassroots promo and local PR firms to liaise public outreach and opportunities</p>
<p>- $30k for fuel, upkeep, maintenance of Tour Transportation.  Tour vehicle already attained</p>
<p>- $7500 for tour management team to coordinate, report, procure, budget, analyze and optimize entire tour.</p>
<p>The entire tour budget is $75,000. Every contribution is truly appreciate, but we broke down to be equipped for the tour at $35 - $50 from 1500 fans; or $100 x 750. Yeah we were surprised how reasonable it was too. This campaign is to offset costs of the needed resources to give the music a fair, none corporate monopoly backed chance, to flourish on these stops. We look to commence the tour shortly after the crowd fund concludes.  Looking to add your town if not coming already.</p><p><strong>Commission Recognitions received:</strong></p>
<p>- Reverbnation's 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd top Hip Hop artists in the Mountain West region 3 years straight</p>

They played by the rules, they used conventional means, they paid every talent manager to help them get ahead, and rubbed all the ""right"" shoulders.  But they see now that the talley of success they have accrued thus far only came from rubbing elbows with one group of people.  The Fans! The Commission will engage the only people that have the real clout to determine their success.  You the fans past, present, and future! We, The Commission's exposure & management team, have created a highly effective digitial/ground campaign strategy to penetrate these markets and expose this quality, harmonious, unique brand of hip hop to the masses in this tour.  The breakdown will be (20 markets/over 6 - 8 months):
- $6500 for Social Media/Online Push that will garner a opening introduction and continuous brand recognition to these markets
- $8000 to execute a customized ""Industry"" campaign including ""Taster Days"" to the DJ's, radio stations, and hip hop music afficianados in these markets and partners in sub markets to see key endorsements
- $30k - $40k for ground teams for grassroots promo and local PR firms to liaise public outreach and opportunities
- $30k for fuel, upkeep, maintenance of Tour Transportation.  Tour vehicle already attained
- $7500 for tour management team to coordinate, report, procure, budget, analyze and optimize entire tour.
The entire tour budget is $75,000. Every contribution is truly appreciate, but we broke down to be equipped for the tour at $35 - $50 from 1500 fans; or $100 x 750. Yeah we were surprised how reasonable it was too. This campaign is to offset costs of the needed resources to give the music a fair, none corporate monopoly backed chance, to flourish on these stops. We look to commence the tour shortly after the crowd fund concludes.  Looking to add your town if not coming already.Commission Recognitions received:
- Reverbnation's 1st, 2nd & 3rd top Hip Hop artists in the Mountain West region 3 years straight
- Reserved, not paid for, spots from promoters to open for national acts like E-40, Twista, Naughty by Nature, DMX, The Game, Ice Cube, B-Legit, Cypress Hill, and many more. 
- Articles published in several City Weekly's, I.N.K. Mag, Crazy N Sane Mag, Lowrider Mag. As well as several music blogs.  Specifically ""Best Hip Hop Group"", From City Weekly 2010.
We thank you in advance for looking in on funding The Commission's ""Made Men U.S."" Tour.  We hope to garner you as a fan either way the wind blows on your decision to contribute.  facebook.com/commission801",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Tessa, and I am a classically trained musician, voice teacher, and Arts administrator & advocate.  I was trained at the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University and the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.  And as part of my pet project, Riding for a Reason, I have been cycling hundreds of miles to raise funds for various causes in my hometown, as well as to give back to my hometown the only way I know how--with music--since 2011.

Being a freelance musician and not-for-profit administrator, I do not have the means on hand to pay for this trip out of pocket.  I am seeking your help in order to make this incredible career enhancing opportunity a reality.  This strategic trip will help me broaden my performing experience, gain knowledge of international arts administration & philanthropy, and lead to future study of an Italian art form in its homeland.

</h3>
<p>On October 22nd, 2014, I booked a day in the studio and began the journey to make my second album Bridging Borders.  The album explores both the beauty and challenge of those intersections in life of culture, religion, language and geography.    <br/><br/>This album is a reflection of the idea that despite those differences that divide us, it is those differences that make us stronger.  My Album Bridging Borders invites you to explore and celebrate those differences between us.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>This album though is nothing without you.  Join in, contribute in whatever 
way you can, become a part of the vision of Bridging 
Borders!  You can pre-purchase the CD, purchase tickets to the CD release or book a house concert.  <br/></p>
My CD release party will be a musical celebration of the idea of Bridging Borders.  A representative from Wakefield for Refugees will share the story of the families from Syria that have come to settle in Wakefield. Recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation commission, that studied the issue of Residential schools, will also be shared.  <br/><span></span><p><span><br/></span>This album is made up of 11 songs, the songs explore stories from within and beyond our borders.  The Borealis Expedition a song that charts the tragic journey of the Karluk, that left our West coast just over 100 years ago that was shipwrecked, a hopeful song called Two Feathers that considers Indigenous, Canadian relations, a French Chansonnier song written about Quebec's Charter of Values, ""Can you see me"" considers the refugee crisis.  A song about the Middle East, a song about Haiti, songs about our heritage here on this land, about war and peace, about our steps through life  <br/></p>These songs are about our time we are sharing on this earth right now, these turbulent times.  The album is a shamelessly hopeful one that explores the beauty and tragedy of the intersections that both divide and unite us. <br/><span><br/></span>If you're not familiar with my music, you can always check out my first album at  <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/christophe-elie-new-cd-bridging-borders/my%20first%20CD"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://chriselie.bandcamp.com</a>. <br/><br/><h3>CD Release Party <br/>
</h3>The Bridging Borders CD release party will be held on Sunday June 5th at 4:00 at the Blacksheep Inn, Wakefield QC.  Joining me as special guests will be North Easton, Eniid and my musical partners - Rock Stock and Barrel.<br/><br/>The CD Release will include a representative from Refugees for Wakefield who will be providing an update on their progress. There will also be a reading related to the recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that reviewed the impact of Residential schools on the indigenous community.  <br/>

The campaign photo is by Richard Smith of a bridge in Pensacola Florida.   And thank you, for listening to the music!<br/><ul> </ul> </div> </div>","Christophe Elie - New CD Bridging Borders 

On October 22nd, 2014, I booked a day in the studio and began the journey to make my second album Bridging Borders.  The album explores both the beauty and challenge of those intersections in life of culture, religion, language and geography.    This album is a reflection of the idea that despite those differences that divide us, it is those differences that make us stronger.  My Album Bridging Borders invites you to explore and celebrate those differences between us.  

This album though is nothing without you.  Join in, contribute in whatever 
way you can, become a part of the vision of Bridging 
Borders!  You can pre-purchase the CD, purchase tickets to the CD release or book a house concert.  
My CD release party will be a musical celebration of the idea of Bridging Borders.  A representative from Wakefield for Refugees will share the story of the families from Syria that have come to settle in Wakefield. Recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation commission, that studied the issue of Residential schools, will also be shared.  This album is made up of 11 songs, the songs explore stories from within and beyond our borders.  The Borealis Expedition a song that charts the tragic journey of the Karluk, that left our West coast just over 100 years ago that was shipwrecked, a hopeful song called Two Feathers that considers Indigenous, Canadian relations, a French Chansonnier song written about Quebec's Charter of Values, ""Can you see me"" considers the refugee crisis.  A song about the Middle East, a song about Haiti, songs about our heritage here on this land, about war and peace, about our steps through life  These songs are about our time we are sharing on this earth right now, these turbulent times.  The album is a shamelessly hopeful one that explores the beauty and tragedy of the intersections that both divide and unite us. If you're not familiar with my music, you can always check out my first album at  http://chriselie.bandcamp.com. CD Release Party 
The Bridging Borders CD release party will be held on Sunday June 5th at 4:00 at the Blacksheep Inn, Wakefield QC.  Joining me as special guests will be North Easton, Eniid and my musical partners - Rock Stock and Barrel.The CD Release will include a representative from Refugees for Wakefield who will be providing an update on their progress. There will also be a reading related to the recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that reviewed the impact of Residential schools on the indigenous community.

As soon as a song becomes that moment that you are inside of, that place, is the ""why"" behind why I write and love music. Those are the moments I have been chasing while writing and recording these songs. The album I am planning to release is 9 songs I have chosen from about a 9 month period of writing last year. As I began to take my songwriting more seriously during this time, I really wanted them to be captured in a raw, up close and personal feel. So I went to Carter Mahnke, a producer and now great friend, to flesh out these songs and I believe we have done them justice. We spent many hours pumping out each part in Carters bedroom studio in Norfolk, Va. as well as other incredible musicians from the Norfolk and Lancaster community.<br/></p><p> As it stands now, the album is just about ready to be mastered and then can be published for your hearing! So please, YOU can partner with me to help me raise the funds to release this record!! I've come up with some awesome perks to get the giving season a brewing!

To pay for these jobs to get completed I am looking to raise at least $5,000 through your support. That is the goal, here's a taste of the incentives:<br/>          My personal favorite perk would have to be the set of film photo's Carter Mahnke developed in his own room!

To start, Carter Mahnke has poured so much hard work and precision into the recording process that I cant resist but mention him first. Right off the get go we were on the same page, excited to track with our reel to reel 8 track and tascam 4 track. We were set on capturing real performances and songs that are full of life. Transparency in the recording process was an ease with Carter around and it really shows. A record that sounds great and feels alive is really valuable to me so I wanted to make sure that every aspect was geared towards that motive. The feel of the album is coherent, symbolic, and eerie but warm. Solid musicianship and excellence have been my standards for the writing process, being positive I had written and crafted these songs to the best of my ability. Also, having a cast of incredible musicians on the record helps (I can't do it all!! haha). Carter laid down some beautiful synth and energetic drums, Jon Sieler on upright Bass, Taylor Brandt on violin, Megan Perry Fisher composed a beautiful piano part for the song 'Cold Spin'... the list goes on. Needless to say, I am super blessed to have the golden touch of the community around me on this record. <br/>I couldn't resist going on a tangent and inserting a favorite quote of mine here, but this isn't an essay so I'm not too worried, I think it captures what I am trying to say with the whole value thing.<br/></p><p>          ""It is the cardinal difference between gift and commodity exchange that a gift establishes a feeling-bond between two people, while the sale of a commodity leaves no necessary connection"" <i>The Gift by Lewis Hyde</i></p><p>          Treating these songs as they were a gift to me to give out has been a high priority of mine.

<p>We are <b>Cryptopsy</b>, an extreme metal band from Montreal,
Quebec, Canada. Apparently, we are a ""<i>boundary pushing tech
juggernaut</i>"" and we sound like ""<i>we’re racing each other into a giant
meat grinder, on motor bikes, and that we all have rabies and advanced degrees
in jazz composition</i>"" (according to Mad Sourman from MetalSucks.net).</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>INDEPENDENT ARTISTS</b></p>
<p>After
being on a record label for our entire career, in 2012, we decided to go
independent.  We released our album <i>Cryptopsy</i> and we were extremely pleased with the outcome.
 <b>Supported by our fans</b>,<b> </b>we distributed and sold thousands of albums across
the entire globe and had the opportunity to tour <b>Japan</b>,<b> Western and Eastern
Europe</b>, the<b> UK</b>,<b> South America</b>,<b> Scandinavia</b>, <b>Canada</b> and we even got to play on a
metal cruise ship. Without fans coming out to the shows, buying our
merchandise and our music, this would never have been possible.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>MORE MUSIC</b></p>
<p>Cryptopsy has a lengthy
writing process as we strive to top our previous release and challenge
ourselves creatively.  After three years, many of you are eager to hear

</div>","We are Cryptopsy, an extreme metal band from Montreal,
Quebec, Canada. Apparently, we are a ""boundary pushing tech
juggernaut"" and we sound like ""we’re racing each other into a giant
meat grinder, on motor bikes, and that we all have rabies and advanced degrees
in jazz composition"" (according to Mad Sourman from MetalSucks.net).
INDEPENDENT ARTISTS
After
being on a record label for our entire career, in 2012, we decided to go
independent.  We released our album Cryptopsy and we were extremely pleased with the outcome.
 Supported by our fans, we distributed and sold thousands of albums across
the entire globe and had the opportunity to tour Japan, Western and Eastern
Europe, the UK, South America, Scandinavia, Canada and we even got to play on a
metal cruise ship. Without fans coming out to the shows, buying our
merchandise and our music, this would never have been possible.
MORE MUSIC
Cryptopsy has a lengthy
writing process as we strive to top our previous release and challenge
ourselves creatively.  After three years, many of you are eager to hear
new material.  We listened: Instead of an album, we will release a series
of EPs entitled The Book of Suffering.
This approach will allow us to put out new music more often while remaining
true to our standards of quality.
With your support, we will
be able to fully share our creative vision of extreme technical music through
enhanced sound, original artwork, videos and live show visuals.

<p>Our Story</p>
<p>Cate and Chris met six years ago and were immediate comrades. We both had varied musical pasts and had stepped away from writing and playing. After relocating to the same block in New Orleans, we began to casually pick up our instruments again and found that we had quite similar natural aesthetics for music.  Over time, we began toying with harmonies and collaborating on songs, with no real intentions of performing out or recording.  The music gradually became a central bond in our friendship and strengthened our creative musings.  A year or so later, Chad entered the picture.  He became sweethearts with Chris and mutual best friends with Cate.  After hearing a couple rehearsals, Chad started to lend a rich third part to our harmonies and piano fills over the guitar and uke.  Needless to say, it became swiftly apparent that he was the vital finishing touch to the band’s sound. The three of us continued to write and play around the neighborhood; on friends porches and in living rooms.  Never seeking an audience, just truly enjoying the craft of songwriting and the feeling of making music together.  On any given day, you could hear our three part harmonies lofting out of Chris’ open door.  One day, while singing on the front porch, a Bywater local heard us playing a tune and invited us to do a local gig.  We came up with the name ""The Wanting"" in reference to the ""high lonesome sound"" of early bluegrass and traditional Appalachian music. There's a pervasive yearning in those songs that really speaks to the human spirit.  It’s that feeling that was the inspiration for the name and the essence of our songs. From that moment on, our band became mobile, continuing to be booked around the city at some very unique venues and on the local radio. </p>
<p><br/>The genuine response that we have gotten to our music has been really incredible.  We've received a great deal of support as a band from our favorite watering hole, BJ's in the Bywater, and our local radio station WWOZ.  We began to get booked at BJ’s due, in large part, to  Ryan Scully.  Scully is the singer and guitarist from the legendary New Orleans jazz, funk, rock band, Morning 40 Federation.  He has been and continues to be one of our biggest supporters and introduced us to WWOZ DJ AJ “The Boudin Man” Rodrigue. To be asked to play, streaming live/in-studio on WWOZ's long running ""Kitchen Sink Sessions”, was a huge honor for all three of us and the response we received contributed greatly to our decision to record this album. During our performance a DJ from the station phoned in and said, ""Those guys are the Peter Paul and Mary of 2017"". We pinched ourselves a few times, had a band meeting the next night, and here we are...in the early stages of recording our debut album ""Autumns Daughter"". Right around that time we met Recording Engineer, Ben Mumphrey.  We were offered a deal to stay and record the album at “Studio in the Country” in Bogalusa, Louisiana. We are all extremely thrilled to render these songs and give them a new life, as a collection, with accompanying art work and music videos. With your support we hope to do so in the fall of this year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your Support</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise enough funds to rent the studio, hire the engineer, pay musicians, and for mixing and mastering. All of this combined will most likely cost more than our goal amount but it will get us well on our way. Once we have the album complete we will set up a small tour and hopefully play in a town near you! </p>
<p>We have some really great perks set up, the most special being recordings on one-off records. The record will be made on vintage recording gear from the 1930’s that records directly to vinyl. We'll record a handful of our songs in one take, probably on his back porch. Those who choose this incentive will get a unique, one of a kind Wanting record! We are also doing some live studio Skype or FaceTime performances for our supporters outside of New Orleans. </p>
<p> Thank you very much for your consideration and supporting our passion! We hope to have our debut album ""Autumns Daughter"" for you very soon!!</p>

<p>Everyone in Beckon Lane is passionate about music! We have spent a long time writing these songs, testing them live, tweaking them and making sure every single song that will be featured on this album is brilliant! <br/><br/>We decided to start this campaign to fund our album recording sessions, we are not asking for the whole amount, but for what will be part of the recording. The amount raised will help us make sure we can spend more time in the studio, recording every note as perfectly as possible and with the help of mixer/engineer/producer Philip Wilbraham, and we can release an album that we as a band, as well as everyone involved and contributing, can be proud of! </p>We are campaigning to raise the amount of £2000. The actual budget is going to be a little over double that amount, although we cannot be sure until we have the final bill land at our table. <br/>Remember, we are asking you to buy our record in advance, to help with the costs of recording, PR and other costs involved, so Another Paradise can be released. <br/> </div><div>

</ul></div>","Hi! I’m Gleb Kolyadin, and you might know me as the pianist and composer for iamthemorning. This time I invite you to take part in creating something unusual.Last September iamthemorning received the Album of the Year at the Progressive Music Awards.An incredible luck and honour, it gave me hope that I might spark your interest with something different – an instrumental album. With several years in the making, this project became the essence of everything I enjoy as a musician. Classical piano, ethnic influences, electronic oddness, minimalism, art-rock and fusion – all blend together.I put together a group of amazingly talented musicians to help bring this all to life, and I am sure the names will get you excited. To keep things interesting, I asked them all to unleash their creative freedom, so be prepared for unique and wild. Also, for all you audiophiles out there, I’m preparing a special high resolution treat.The project is well on its way, and the piano recording is already scheduled at the same amazing Moscow studio that brought you piano of the Lighthouse. Iamthemorning always sets its bar high when it comes to recording, and we've always been working very hard to be able to afford to live up to this bar, and used crowdfunding a couple of times before. This project is no different – it keeps striving for perfection. But this time, it's only me and you guys. As previously with iamthemorning, every penny goes towards the actual recording, mixing and delivering the album, and every penny counts. This is the crucial moment, and I put the destiny of this record into your hands, knowing that together we can make it happen. Join in, spread the word, and I promise the result is going to be like nothing you’ve heard before. Rewards: 
​Link to the album download a day before the official release
Signed and numbered CD from a limited edition, printed specifically for the campaign
Wooden USB-flash with engraving and hi-res version of the album
Beautiful album cover t-shirts
Signed score sheet
Stickers with cover artwork 
Collection of all musical drafts and improvisations from 2012 to 2016

<p>Greetings, Friend! We are female fronted (and axed!) thrash/death metal band POKERFACE from Russia. Our music is quite unusual combination of old-school thrash riffs and female scream-growling vocals. Since the moment of formation in 2013 we released two albums - EP 'Terror Is The Law' and LP 'Divide And Rule', and performed many notable shows with such bands like Sodom, Kreator, Megadeth, Sepultura, Overkill, Children of Bodom, Vader, Death DTA, not only in Russia, but in Europe as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to record and release a full-length 10-track album ""Game On"" in first months of the next year. The new album is going to be a natural evolution of our previous works, but different and much more versatile at the same time. There would be still fast and agressive thrash riffs, but songs will be a bit more complex - we added melodies, groove parts, so particularry it would remind some mix of thrash, melodic death and groove metal. There will be some experimental songs also, songs you would never expect from POKERFACE. </p>
<p>New album ""Game On"" will have strong ideological concept - we plan to work on album's artwork with the man, who did great arts for the famous (we won't be afraid to say legendary) band, but we keep his name in secret). So, as you can see, we have a really serious intentions to make this album a really strong work, which will allow us to make a huge step further on a big worldwide metal stage!</p>
<p>And we did some demos of new songs, so you could check them out!</p>
<p>So, it's a fair deal: you support us - we reward you, isn't it? Let's see what we can offer to you besides a good album, of course)</p>

<h3>What Am I Doing?</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>   My name is Caleb Henry, and I started this campaign in hopes of reaching my goal of raising enough funds to record my debut EP! This EP, entitled ""Where Am I?"" is a culmination of songs that I've written over the years that express my reflective thoughts on love, loss, being too comfortable at the bottom, and trying to find the light through it all. These songs are a blend of Country, Blues, and Alternative with my own little twist of American Rock and Roll.</p>
<p>   I started playing music when I was just a kid, but fell in love with it far before that. My only exposure to playing music in front of a crowd in my younger days, was on Sundays on the worship team at my parents church. I always loved playing on the worship team because it really drew out my creativity, which caused me to start writing my own songs. Now, at 21 years old, over 348 original songs, and many different venues and stages later, I'm finally stepping out in pursuing my solo music, as well as still continuing to play the stages of Hollywood with my Punk Rock band D.K.A.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need To Raise!</h3>
<ul>
<li>$2500 is what I've calculated to be the total cost to record a 4 song EP. This money goes towards paying for a studio, recording engineer, rented equipment, and necessary production costs.</li>
<li>For all those who donate $10 or more, a link to download a copy of the EP will be available once it is released!</li>
<li>In the unfortunate event that not all the funds are raised, the money that has been donated will go into a secure place where I will continue to raise money and put my own money in as well.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   For those of you that know me, you know that I've been heavily involved in music for many many years. It's rare that there is a moment where I do not have music playing either out loud, or through my headphones. I've always felt that music was the most powerful force on earth, outside of God, and that it knows no boundaries when it comes to human connection. It's my philosophy that if I die without changing anybody's life, that it was a wasted one for me. But if I can change even one person's life, and show them something more than themselves, then everything was worth it, and music is how I think I'll be able to do that. This is why this campaign, and what I've already done and am continuing to do with D.K.A., along with my solo music, is so important. I can't get enough of music, and I want to give what I get to everyone in hopes doing what I can to make this world a better place.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>   It's no surprise that finances are tight for everyone right now, especially during the Holidays. So it is very understandable that not everyone will be able to give financially. But even your prayers and encouragement are extremely helpful and very much appreciated! You can also help spread the word about this campaign by using the sharing tools! Many artists have relied solely on word of mouth because of how powerful it can be! But regardless, I have faith in my friends, family, and fans that we will be able to get this thing done, and get original and heartfelt music to the world!</p>
</div><p>I wish a very Merry Christmas, a Happy New Year, and God's blessings for all of you!</p><p>-Caleb</p></div>","What Am I Doing?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Denice Rippentrop has spent the last 30 years composing gospel music for choirs. Throughout her career, no one has inspired her more than Amy Carmichael. Now, to honor her, Denice has embarked on a journey to share the power of her words through music. The funding of this project will help to spread Carmichael’s powerful words and legacy worldwide.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $30,000 dollars to complete production of the album at Avatar Studios in New York City, where the Hamilton soundtrack was recorded. Along with the studio's expenses, Denise has secured the talents of Broadway vocalist Vanessa Libby and pianist Allison Beck. In the event the project is not fully funded, any donations will be set aside until enough funds are secured to move forward with the project.</p>
<p>By donating you will not only be commemorating Amy Carmichael’s legacy, you will also receive the following gifts:</p>
<p>For a donation of$50, you will receive recognition on the packaging of the final album</p>
<p>For $100, you will receive the above and a copy of the final album</p>
<p>For $ 500, you will receive the above and a copy of Amy Carmicheal’s If</p>
<p>For $1000, you will receive all of the above and a selection of sheet music from the compositions</p>
<p>*If you so choose, your donation can be made in the name or memory of a loved one – just send us an email.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to honoring Amy Carmichael, a portion of the proceeds from this album will be donated to the Dohnavur Fellowship, which continues Carmichael’s work in India and around the world.  <a href=""http://dohnavurfellowship.org.in/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here for more information about the Dohnavur Fellowship.</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The music has already been written and the studio and recording artists have been secured.  Once we have gathered enough funding, the project will enter production.  Everyone involved has participated professionally in similar projects in the past, so this project can move forward with little risk.  In the event that not enough funds are raised by the deadline, all money collected will be held until enough has been secured to proceed with the recording.  No donation incentives will be altered, no matter how much time may pass.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone who wishes to contribute is able.  If you wish to contribute, spread the word about our project!  If you know someone who will be interested in the album when it’s finished whether they can make a contribution or not, tell them!</p>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or would like to contribute in another way, feel free to contact us at IfWordsCouldSing@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Additional donations can be made directly to this address:<br/>Beautiful Star Publishing, Inc.<br/>8270 North Hayden Road #2047<br/>Scottsdale, AZ 85258</p>

<p>Where would we all be if as children, our dreams had
attention and support?  How many lives
would be happier?  How many people
wouldn't be serving time or dead and gone.  Potential is lying dormant in so
many people today.  TrackHouse Productions is a team of individuals specializing
in music production, songwriting, engineering, marketing, artist development,
artist management, video and photography. 
We have college degrees in our focused fields as well.  We all have paid
dues interning with artist and at different studios.  The invested time helped
us perfect our craft.  We believe in paying it forward.  TrackHouse helps and shares  our collected knowledge and experience with
many.  However we would like to be able to reach more.  Our work is outgrowing
our current work space. We need your help to invest in the dreams and goals of
young artist.  Music is not a career to some yet music is life to those who
can't go a minute without hearing lyrics or melodies in there head.  Our mission
is to birth a creative place and environment for young artist.  A place where they can be inspired, encouraged,
mentored, and guided to help turn their passion into a profession.  A place where they can express
themselves musically instead of turning to the streets or negative influences.
Musical talent doesn't guarantee fame but studies have shown that music
improves motor and reasoning skills. 
Music is the universal language. 
We at TrackHouse would like to do our part in making sure music is positive
and nurturing once it vibrates into ears.</p>

10/15/15 - Tightening up a couple new songs to record this Saturday and Sunday at Ohm studios. 
Let's make some music It has been more than three years since sitting down in the living room of a small Santa Monica efficiency and recording my first album, Heavy and Dizzy. Now it is time to do it again - in Austin, TX.
If you don't know me, my name is Matt. An Illinois native who has been hopping around the country and making music in my free time. This project is small in scope but has been a long time in the making - and I'm coming to you for help. 
Here's the skinny. I am looking to produce a five song EP by the end of the year. Most of the music has been written and solidified and now it is time to get into the recording studio. Your support is what will help me get there.    What I Need & What You Get Let me break it down for y'all:  I want to get in the studio for  5 days and am looking to raise $2500 dollars minimum. Backers will have access to cool perks like artwork and early releases. If I don't reach the goal, that's okay! The project will just be scaled down. But, I am recording some music whether you like it or not!


    Risks & Challenges What are some of the risks? Bad music. Electrocution. Not following through.
What are some of the challenges? Writer's block. Funding. Rhyming the word orange.
But in all seriousness, of course there is risk with anything, especially creative. It's not for everyone and sometimes it just doesn't work. Take a listen to the album I made three years ago, which was produced in my living room with some friends. I promise the care, emotion, honesty and effort that went into that album will go into this one. There is a reason it has been three years since the last album. I want to make sure everything I record and put in the world represents me to the utmost.
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Share the campaign with your friends and see what they can do! Wish me luck and pray I don't go crazy in the process.

<p>Angel City
Opera is dedicated to bringing thoughtful opera to the greater Los Angeles
metropolitan area.  Its mission is to keep opera thriving and flourishing
by providing exciting live performances for the local community.  New
opera audiences can constantly be fostered through exposure to anyone
heretofore unfamiliar with the form so we leave no stone unturned.  We are currently working to provide school shows to underserved populations in LA and plan to have opportunities for folks to come to shows through Angel Tickets who wouldn't otherwise get a night out at the opera.  Los
Angeles is also a hotbed for young, burgeoning talent in need of opportunities
for experience.  Angel City Opera will be an outlet for these bright young
stars as well as some who are more seasoned and have made lives here. 
Audiences deserve to see all the talent our area has to offer.  Opera is
bursting with relatable human emotion and conflict relevant to modern
society.  Angel City Opera will never tire in its effort to find
creative ways to bring opera to LA audiences.   </p>
<p>I had a taste of producing when I lived in South Florida.  I whipped up a concert version of <i>La Traviata</i> in a mere 10 weeks.  It was a huge success and garnered critical acclaim in the Sun Sentinel.  We sold-out the beautiful Josephine S. Leiser Center (owned by Florida Grand Opera) in the historic Riverwalk District of Ft. Lauderdale.  It was a simple but elegant affair in the same intimate format I am following with Angel City Opera.  It's a great place to start!  The success of my experience with <i>La Traviata</i> and the wonderful singers I cast bouyed my confidence for this endeavor but I am so much better equipped this time out.  With Angel City Opera, I have assembled a board of highly experienced producers to help guide me and an impressive Advisory Committee as well.  Being capable and confident goes a long way but surrounding yourself with the right people is the true key to success.  Please check out the bios of the incredible professionals who are helping me build this company at angelcityopera.com</p>

Companies are not entities unto themselves but living, breathing

access the people they need to fill in the gaps in their knowledge.  And if that isn’t enough, add discipline,

My name is Hugues Andries. I'm a 21 year old Canadian missionary. After my secondary education was completed, I decided to start a beekeeping business with my brother Thierry. I took several other jobs also such as working on a dairy farm for a year and a half and working on maple syrup farms. Since August of 2013, I have been working for an NGO in India, but that will end in June of this year. Please visit my website, <a href=""http://missionnaireanabaptiste.org/english/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://missionnaireanabaptiste.org/english/</a> most of it is in French, but I have content in 8 languages. It is about my life in India and my belief in God. You can also order free gospel tracts on it, I transfer the orders to the Society that I work for.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Out here I work with supporting orphanages and providing basic medical assistance to the poorest villagers (those who pick the tea leaves that end up in your tea cups...). Plus we run a literature office from where local pastors can get tracts in many Indian languages. I believe reaching out to others who are in greater need than ourselves is a clear teaching of Jesus, and would like to keep on even after the end of my contract with this NGO (The Gospel Tract and Bible Society). </span></p>

<h3>Why we we need you:</h3>

<p>SO WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP: 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 dollar donations will all be welcome! We don't know how to thank you for your support, but hope that you will trust us with your money and pray that the Lord will bless you for this, as he blesses all those who help their fellowmen for His name's sake. International aid organisms and NGOs have said there are widespread fears of epidemics in some islands, and in some places there is already a lot of dyssentry. </p>
<p>We also have little items you can get in exchange for your support. My brother and I work a lot with producing maple syrup and honey. We offer to send you some in exchange for your great help. SO BY GIVING A LITTLE MORE, YOU ARE HELPING US SUSTAIN A BUSINESS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO KEEP HELPING OUR FELLOWMEN. IF YOU LIKE THESE PRODUCTS, CONTACT US AT achandries@gmail.com TO BUY MORE OR DO IT THROUGH EBAY. However, as of now, we cannot promise such for non-Canadian addresses. We hope to find a way to thank our non-Canadian donors too. </p>
<p>I know our goal of $10,000 my seem ambitious, but I really hope to get there thanks to your generosity and confidence. Should we gather less than $4,000 we will give it to an NGO called Christian Service International, and they will use it in Vanuatu rebuilding projects.</p>
<h3>The impact your money can make:</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Your money will go to people that have been left out by large scale aid programs. there are 166,000 people in need of immediate as well as long term life saving aid, in order to resume their farming, escape epidemics, make revenue, send their children to school, and have a happier life.</p>
<p>In India, I have gotten acquainted with the needs of poor villagers, with basic medical help, and with helping farmers, schools and orphanages. </p>

Hi! My name is Hugues Andries. I'm a 21 year old Canadian missionary. After my secondary education was completed, I decided to start a beekeeping business with my brother Thierry. I took several other jobs also such as working on a dairy farm for a year and a half and working on maple syrup farms. Since August of 2013, I have been working for an NGO in India, but that will end in June of this year. Please visit my website, http://missionnaireanabaptiste.org/english/ most of it is in French, but I have content in 8 languages. It is about my life in India and my belief in God. You can also order free gospel tracts on it, I transfer the orders to the Society that I work for.
Out here I work with supporting orphanages and providing basic medical assistance to the poorest villagers (those who pick the tea leaves that end up in your tea cups...). Plus we run a literature office from where local pastors can get tracts in many Indian languages. I believe reaching out to others who are in greater need than ourselves is a clear teaching of Jesus, and would like to keep on even after the end of my contract with this NGO (The Gospel Tract and Bible Society). 
For the last while, I have become interested in some of the Islands of the Pacific, namely New Caledonia (a French territory) and the Vanuatu Islands (formerly know as New Hebrides Islands, a joint colony of France and Great Britain). I have several pen pals now in those countries and am learning more and more about them, in the hope of bringing the Gospel and humanitarian help there someday.
Well, what do you know? Cyclone Pam hit both archipelagos mid-March and destroyed much of Vanuatu, the poorest and most exposed of the two archipelagos. I now feel compelled to go and help rebuild, especially in remote areas.
Here is what CNN had to say just as the storm was hitting the Vanuatu Islands. http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/13/asia/cyclone-pam-vanuatu/ 

""The wind outside is terrifying,"" Michael Wolfe, World Vision's national director in Vanuatu, told that organization.

</h3> <p><b></b></p>I've got a new CD called <b>New Paint</b> with 11 songs recorded and I need your help to finish it up.  This is my first effort in 5 years and I've enlisted Jud Caswell to record it professionally, along with 14 fantastic musicians to help me bring the songs to life.  My best collection of tunes - and it's ready for production.  <br/><p><b></b></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Project<br/>
</h3>All of my previous CDs have been recorded by me in my studio at home.  This one is different.  Recording at Frog Hollow Studios with Jud Caswell and his great gear has been a synergistic collaboration.  It raised the bar for me, and I'm delighted with the result.<br/>Along with Jud, I brought in 14 musicians to help me out on this recording.  Excuse me, what I meant to say was <i><b>14 AMAZING MUSICIANS</b></i>.  Oh sure, I still do some harmonies and play a couple instruments on some tracks, but this record is all about collaboration.  Some very fine musicians helped me out: Chris Simpson, Gary Lawless, Hal Ahlers, and Scott Woodruff - collectively ""Leopard Girls"" - bring a full rock band into 3 songs.  Jud joins me on several tracks with guitar, bass, and vocals. Jason Rafalak performs upright bass, along with Nancy Roderick on violin and Fred Cantu on sax for 2 of the jazz-influenced tracks.  You'll hear the trio Brio - Matt Loosigian, Deb Hensley, and Martin Swinger - harmonizing on 4 of the tracks.  Paul Benham is a masterful effects man with his e-guitar on a pair of tunes.  And the amazing mouth trumpet of Heather Hardy rocks the lead on one of the acoustic tracks.<br/>All that adds up to a lot of studio hours!  Help!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Deal<br/>
</h3>So now we're down to mixing, mastering, and production, and yes, it all costs more moolah.  But what a difference it makes to have a pro do these instead of me in my home studio!  <br/>This is what it's all about, though.  I need to bring this project out of the studio and into the world, and I need your help to do it.<br/>I'm offering some pretty cool perks for your generous contribution to the effort.  Along with the actual CD or download, you can get your hands on previous CDs/downloads (even the WHOLE COLLECTION), get your name in the liner notes, have me record a cover of a tune, or sign up for a house concert.  And if there's a perk that I'm missing, let me know and I'll add it just for you! <br/>You can check out my previously released music on <a href=""http://www.welcomefarmmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my website, welcomefarmmusic.com</a>.  <br/>

Jason Rafalak performs upright bass, along with Nancy Roderick on violin and Fred Cantu on sax for 2 of the jazz-influenced tracks.  You'll hear the trio Brio - Matt Loosigian, Deb Hensley, and Martin Swinger - harmonizing on 4 of the tracks.  Paul Benham is a masterful effects man with his e-guitar on a pair of tunes.  And the amazing mouth trumpet of Heather Hardy rocks the lead on one of the acoustic tracks.All that adds up to a lot of studio hours!  Help!
  The Deal
So now we're down to mixing, mastering, and production, and yes, it all costs more moolah.  But what a difference it makes to have a pro do these instead of me in my home studio!  This is what it's all about, though.  I need to bring this project out of the studio and into the world, and I need your help to do it.I'm offering some pretty cool perks for your generous contribution to the effort.  Along with the actual CD or download, you can get your hands on previous CDs/downloads (even the WHOLE COLLECTION), get your name in the liner notes, have me record a cover of a tune, or sign up for a house concert.  And if there's a perk that I'm missing, let me know and I'll add it just for you! You can check out my previously released music on my website, welcomefarmmusic.com.  
  Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't contribute in $$, you can still help get the word out.  The campaign needs to reach more folks than I personally know, so I'm very grateful if you share it with your friends.  And stay in touch - I'll be announcing a CD release event or two coming up soon.  It would be great to see you in person!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

largely in the potential of its youth. In order for economic and social
development to occur in African communities, urban or rural, individuals have
to be inspired and educated. The purpose of the Dare to Live Tour is to inspire
the youth as the future African engineers, designers, doctors, artists,
lawyers, entrepreneurs, and more. The
tour will consist of two seminars. The first seminar is entitled “Discover Your
Potential” and will address how individuals can believe in themselves as they
work to discover their career paths.The second seminar is entitled
“Maximize Your Potential” and will address the steps that individuals have to
take in order to overcome obstacles and make their dreams a reality, including
the pursuit of careers that fit their passion and abilities. The
Dare to Live Tour seminars will be led by inspiring individuals who have
ventured out to achieve their dreams and have meaningful insight to share with

goals. </p>
<p>The Dare to Live Tour team also plans
to use performing arts as the medium recognized as most effective for capturing

dance performances along with training seminars to transform youth.  Its impact will be measured in the short-term
by the number of youth who set goals and plans for their lives and in the
long-term by the number of youth who become more active in changing their
communities.  A group of 13 performers

</div><p></p><p>Greetings! </p><p>I’ve spent the last 20 years playing guitar and singing all
over the San Francisco bay area.  I have
played in neighborhood taverns, hipster cafes, jazz lounges, blues clubs and
even the venerable Fillmore’s “Poster Room”. 
</p>
<p> Late in 2011 a dear
friend put a beat up old Gibson flattop guitar in my hands and my journey began
anew. As I strummed that guitar, I heard Robert Johnson, Blind Willie Johnson
and Mississippi John Hurt lurking in there and calling out to me. </p>
<p>So, I went into the woodshed and began learning all the old
Delta blues songs that beckoned me forward. Three years later, in December
2014, after a couple hundred gigs I went into the studio and recorded my first
solo album – <b><i>GHOSTS,</i></b> a collection of original compositions and 1920's
acoustic blues.  </p>
<p><b><i>GHOSTS </i></b>was very successful, spending five months in the Top 5
of the Acoustic Blues, Roots Music Report Independent Radio charts and
garnering rave reviews from domestic and foreign press.  </p>
<p>For example here’s one from <u>The Smokey Mountain Blues Society</u> - <i>""If you are a finger picker, or lover
of that music, this is a great new CD to add to your collection. His fresh ideas,
and takes on the old classics ring with a love of yesteryear, and a love of
keeping it alive today.""</i> </p>
<p>While over in Spain the folks at <u>La Hora Del Blues</u>
said - ""<i>Bill does a true sorcery in
every song where he evokes all Delta ghosts."" </i></p>
<p>Since releasing <b><i>GHOSTS</i></b>, I’ve continued to write
original music inspired by folks like Woody Guthrie, Tom Waits and
Blind Willie Johnson.  I’ve also added
some new collaborators expanding my ensemble to include acoustic bass and clarinet,
forming “Bill Philippe’s Delta Trio”.  </p>
<p>I’m now ready to get back in the studio and record a new
album of original tunes so that’s where our project comes in. </p>
<p><b>The Project</b></p>
<p>The new album will feature a batch of songs that I believe are the
best I’ve written in over 30 years of songwriting. These songs continue to explore the
themes featured on<b> <i>GHOSTS, </i></b>these are songs
about love, loss and our journey through life’s “Parade”.  Parade is a theme that is central to this
group of songs – the Parade of experiences that make up our life – the joyous,
raucous, mournful and heartbreaking, all roll by and carry us along.  So it’s only fitting that this new album will
be called<b><i> “Parade” </i></b></p>
<p>I need your support to cover the costs of RECORDING, PRODUCTION
and PROMOTION.  With your support I can pay
for studio time, recording engineers, CD mastering, manufacturing of CD’s and radio
and press promotion campaigns. By supporting my Indiegogo campaign you play a
vital role in bringing this project to life! </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There are lots of fun rewards you can earn for supporting my
album project, from copies of the CD to your own House Concert.</span></p>

for your support - Let’s get into trouble!</p>

original music inspired by folks like Woody Guthrie, Tom Waits and
Blind Willie Johnson.  I’ve also added
some new collaborators expanding my ensemble to include acoustic bass and clarinet,
forming “Bill Philippe’s Delta Trio”.  
I’m now ready to get back in the studio and record a new
album of original tunes so that’s where our project comes in. 
The Project
The new album will feature a batch of songs that I believe are the
best I’ve written in over 30 years of songwriting. These songs continue to explore the
themes featured on GHOSTS, these are songs
about love, loss and our journey through life’s “Parade”.  Parade is a theme that is central to this
group of songs – the Parade of experiences that make up our life – the joyous,
raucous, mournful and heartbreaking, all roll by and carry us along.  So it’s only fitting that this new album will
be called “Parade” 
I need your support to cover the costs of RECORDING, PRODUCTION
and PROMOTION.  With your support I can pay
for studio time, recording engineers, CD mastering, manufacturing of CD’s and radio
and press promotion campaigns. By supporting my Indiegogo campaign you play a
vital role in bringing this project to life! There are lots of fun rewards you can earn for supporting my
album project, from copies of the CD to your own House Concert.
Thank you
for your support - Let’s get into trouble!

Starting a financial/payment processing company has many barriers to entry, especially when it involves legal compliance. Technical security expertise is paramount to guaranteeing both fan and band financial data is secure as we launch this application.
We have a legal representative experienced in assisting tech startup companies meet statutory compliance, and is also part of the local music circuit. We also have security experts reviewing the application as we go to make sure your data always stays secure.    Other Ways You Can Help

From my journey of brokenness and redemption In Christ Jesus, He has given me ten beautiful songs to share with those hurting

<h1></h1><p><b>Beltana Spellsinger’s “Summerland
Fall” Summer CD project</b></p>
<p>Blessings, friends and loved ones!  I am Beltana Spellsinger, and I am on a
mission.  My Quest?  To spread Love, Music and Passion, throughout
this lovely Universe of ours. It needs it!</p>
<p>My desire is to bring you a new body of music, that has been
inspired by the wonderful people in my life, along with Love, Happiness, Light,
and an expression of my Spirit.</p>
<p>I ask the Universe for assistance in achieving this goal,
which will help me to expand my horizons as a *real touring artist,* a <i>working</i> singer and songwriter… and will
allow me to carry on this work into future projects and travels, to bring my
music and magick to you and to the world.</p>
<p>I am a solo singer, songwriter and guitarist, who
sings original songs inspired by both darkness and light, beauty of life,
passion, magick, mysticism, and above all, I am, inspired by <b>Love.</b></p>
<p>I’ve performed with other bands, such as SONA, F9,
BellaWyck, Spellsinger, and a few others in the distant past.  I’m currently on a brand new path, focusing on
my own creations, playing my own music, and sharing my very own raw soul through this music.  I think it’s pretty worthy, and I think that
you will, too.</p>
<p><b>What I Need… &amp; What You Get…</b></p>
<p><b><i>What I need to accomplish for this first campaign… </i></b></p>
<p>I’m already seeing this into creation, which is exciting for
me.  It’s been a long time since I put
out any new music, and this will
really be the FIRST time that I have
done such a solo effort.</p>
<p>So… what I am in need of:</p>
<p>FUNDS... naturally... for recording, CD production, artwork, some travel, fuel for the fire, a
few minor van expenses, guitar strings, repair on my drum heads, a repair for the crack in the back of my trusty old Takamine guitar, and of course, packaging/mailing funds, to get this CD
completed, and to get it (and the live music!) out to <i>you,</i> in fine form, by the end of this summer!  This will be a simple, brief campaign, just
to get this first CD off the ground and running. </p>
<p>(FYI: For the next campaign, I’ll be planning on doing much
more… including a video… having some *amazing* special guest musicians, and many
more exciting things to come!  It’s going
to be a colorful circus of mayhem and mahvelous madness… and you will want to
stay tuned!)</p>
<p><b><i>What you get…</i></b></p>
<p>Music, music, MUSIC!!! And lots of it!  For this first campaign, I will only be
offering minimal perks… allowed by what time I have available, such as an early
release of the CD, (signed, of course) and the promise to bring you even more
of this kind of music in the very near future. 
I have a fairly busy tour schedule already for this summer; and I plan
to spend my time balanced between touring and recording.  My hopes and dreams are to spend even <i>more</i> time in the studio over the next
year, bringing to light even MORE completed work.  I have several CD’s worth of material, just
waiting to be birthed!  This is just to
get me started, and to get everything rolling.</p>
<p>If I don’t reach my full goal, I’ll still use what I’ve got
to get the CD finished, and get the perk CD’s out to the folks who contribute
at least $25!</p>
<p><b>Your Impact</b></p>
<p>The world needs more happiness. And Passion. The world needs
more <b><i>Music.</i></b>  The world needs more people who are ready to
share that freedom of spirit. The world desperately desires us to encourage, in others, and share our individuality,
creativity, expression of itself, freedom of expression, and our good, spiritual selves. It desires that we gain the courage to go out and make that happen, for those who are
willing to jump in and go for that.  </p>
<p>I will bring you at least some of that… by being able to do
what it is that I do.  I am setting out
to be a force of good in this world, and to simply just… go for it.  For you, for me, for my family, for us
all.  Let’s come together, and love one
another.  Let’s share good times, good
memories, and good music.  Let’s support
one another in our endeavors.  Let’s come
together to make this lifetime a beautiful one.</p>
<p>That’s about the best I can do, and give you… with what I’ve
got.</p>
<p>I’ve got a guitar, a van, some songs, and a beautiful little
girl to care for, who means more in the world to me than anything else.  Help me show her that <i>living your truth,</i> and that living a lifetime of fulfilling your
dreams is not only possible, but is necessary. ;-)</p>
<p><b>Other ways you can help…</b></p>
<p>Contribute, please… if you can.  Any amount will help. Amounts of $25 and $100, and up, are most helpful. If you can contribute, thank you so much.</p><p>Can’t afford to contribute? 
Please just help me spread the word. 
Your word of mouth is worth millions, and it is appreciated more than
you can ever know!</p>
<p>Thank you for your time! 
I am blessed to have been touched, in some way, by each and every one of
you.</p>
<p>Blessed Be,</p>

The Denver Justice Project's (DJP) mandate is to transform law enforcement, end mass incarceration, and seek racial justice.  DJP was started in 2015 by long-time activist, community organizer, and victim of police brutality Alex Landau.  In 2009, Alex was nearly beat to death by Denver police officers, following a traffic stop for an illegal left turn.  Alex required 45 stitches after the assault and was left with a concussion and a traumatic brain injury.  The city eventually awarded Alex a settlement of $795,000, but did not prosecute any of the officers engaged in the assault.  

Following the 2009 beating by Denver policeAlex was an organizer in the Economic and Racial Justice division of The Colorado Progressive Coalition until last year, when he launched DJP.  He frequently travels the U.S. as a passionate an persuasive speaker in forums about police misconduct and social justice.  

Lecturing at the University of Denver
Alex's story hits close to home for me, as we are both minorities but were adopted by white families at young ages.  As a result, we struggle particularly acutely with the knowledge that racism continues to persist so adamantly and grotesquely within our communities.

</h3>
<p>My name is Susie
Cowan, and I am a local business enthusiast. I am a founding member, the executive director, and the event planner for LoA Inc., which is the
non-profit that supports Legends of Arkansas. LoA Inc. has an amazing board of directors that have volunteered countless hours over the
last two years to help build this dream. We do this for the love of our community.
 </p>
<p>In May of 2013, on a
road trip to Nashville the dream of Legends of Arkansas was born. The concept
of using the fun of a family-friendly live music and art festival to promote
our local businesses sounded too good to be true. I'm not really sure how, but
just over three months later, on September 15th, we had the first all-Arkansas
music and art festival, Legends of Arkansas. It was wonderful. There were 20
bands, 3 stages, 30 art and craft vendors, performing artists and workshops all over the
place, and over 1000 attendees. In 2013, we had a $45,000 economic impact on
our River Market District according to the Little Rock Convention and Visitor
Bureau. There were more than a few challenges, but there were even more sweet
moments making it all worth it. </p>
<p>Before the dust had
even settled, we started planning Legends of Arkansas 2014. On May 30th, 2014, we had the second Legends of Arkansas, all-Arkansas Music and Art Festival. It
rained on and off all day long, and we still had over 5000 attendees. There
were four stages this year, over 40 bands, over 50 art and craft vendors, and over
5000 attendees. Our economic impact in 2014 was $159,000. </p>
<p>So here we are now in
2015 planning for 10,000 to 20,000 attendees, which should more than double the
economic impact in the River Market District. There will be 2 stages including
the History Pavilion and the First Security Amphitheater. So far this year
there are over 20 local bands, a great variety of art and craft vendors, a kid's area, a top selection of local food trucks, a great variety of local breweries, live painting, live art, performing art, a hip-hop workshop, family yoga, aerial silks performances, a hula hoop play shop, the Mallory Award winner performance, the Living Legend Award presentation, fire performances, as well as non-profits out there to
educate and have fun too. </p>
<p>We created Legends of
Arkansas for four main reasons: <br/>
1. To promote independent business in Arkansas, <br/>
2. To help educate the people on how easy it can be to live local,<br/>
3. To showcase the talented people of Arkansas, and<br/>
4. To celebrate our friends and neighbors for living their dreams.</p>
<p>The mission of LoA
Inc. is to improve the quality of life by strengthening the communities of
Arkansas from within through Arkansas based, family-friendly, live music and art events. Our hopes are to help grow our own economy to be able to support
more local sustainable jobs in the music, art, and creative industry in
Arkansas.  </p>
<p>Legends of Arkansas is
a free admission event. We pay for the rental fees of the History Pavilion
and First Security Amphitheater, the production company, the
advertising and printing, as well as the artists' fees with money from sponsorship donations.
This crowd funding campaign will fill in the gap. All of our sponsors are
locally owned and operated businesses, so their sponsorship levels are priced
as such. </p>
<p>
This campaign is also about getting more people involved in our community
festival. We want all walks of life to come out, and all kinds of Arkansas
represented in music, art, and independent business. The more people of
Arkansas that get involved, the more it will earn the name Legends of Arkansas.
This is not about the legends of the past; this festival is about celebrating
and promoting the legends of today.  </p>
<p>Our goal for this
campaign is $5000. Our budget for this year's event is just over $19,000. Any and all funds raised will go right back into our community by way of advertising
dollars; printing t-shirts, posters and banners; and artists' pay. If we exceed our
goal, the absolute first thing we will do is hire a tent company to come put
up and break down all those tents! That, in itself, would be a dream come true. The
next goal would be to hire a security company to run all the entrances and
help direct the flow of people as we grow. Our volunteers are great, and as we
grow, our needs are growing. This crowd funding campaign could help us take our
grassroots festival to the next level and make it fully self-sustainable annual event. </p>
<p>The perks for donating
to this campaign are fun, and you get something for donating as little as $5.
 It starts with thank yous and stickers, and work your way up to
posters and t-shirts. There is even a deluxe package that includes signed posters of
your choice of a headliner with all the goodies to go along with it. All
stickers, posters, and t-shirts must be picked up at the Will Call Booth at the
main entrance of the amphitheater the day of the festival.</p>
<p>The next level
is tickets to our Trolley Party, and it is a blast. The ticket will include
local beer, liquor, and live music all while on the trolley; we will also stop for hors
d'oeuvres along the way. It's a two hour tour around the lovely Argenta Art
District and through the River Market District in a private trolley car. </p>
<p>As the levels go up, there are different options for the VIP passes. All VIP passes include a
special area with complimentary local beer, liquor, water, and heavy hors
d'oeuvres being served at different times. Quantities are limited, but we will
do our best to keep different selections coming out throughout the day. There
will be shaded tents in that area, and it has a special view of the
stage. From 4:00pm-8:00pm, Kent Walker is sponsoring the Cheese and Wine Tent and will provide complimentary cheese and wine samplings. The Cheese and Wine Tent tickets, VIP Passes, and Trolley Party Passes are
ONLY available through this campaign and there are a limited amount. </p>
<p>This is where campaign
really starts to get interesting. There are five different themed VIP tents available for
your own private party for you and 3 of your friends. You are welcome to invite
as many friends as you want; they will just need to bring their own
chairs and blankets. These packages include a decorated tent of the theme of your
choice, 4 VIP passes, 4 Wine and Cheese Tent passes, 4 posters, 4 stickers, and a personal thank you on the website and social media. The bad news is you don't get
to keep the tent, decorations, chairs, or tables. The good news is you can pick
up your stickers, posters, and t-shirts the day of the festival when you check
in and receive for your armbands. You will check in at the Will Call Tent, which will be located at the main
entrance of the First Security Amphitheater. </p>
<p>That leaves us with
the ultimate in rock star status; VIP level and side-stage private party for
you and 9 of your closest friends. There will be a roped off area on the
side-stage of the First Security Amphitheater just for your party. There will a hospitality table stocked with local goodies,
seating for 10, and plenty of dancing room. This
package also includes access to the side-stage premium viewing area
for 10 people total, 10 VIP Passes for the other hospitality area, 10
Wine and Cheese passes, 10 t-shirts, 10 posters, 10 stickers, as well as a shout out
live on stage the day of the festival, on the website, and social media. All
the stickers, posters, and t-shirts will be available the day of the festival
when you check in for your armbands. You will check in at the Will Call Tent at the main entrance of the First Security Amphitheater. </p>
<p>There are several ways
you can help support Legends of Arkansas. You can choose one of the awesome
perk levels above, share our campaign with your friends on social media, and also contact us if you are interested in sponsorship opportunities and/or if you
would like to donate your time to volunteer the day of the festival. If you would like to donate anonymously, you can always do that on the top right corner of our website at <a href=""http://www.LegendsofArkansas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.LegendsofArkansas.com</a>. Any way you choose, we appreciate your support for your local musicians, artists, and artisans. </p>
<p>Please join us for an
all-Arkansas kind of good time on Saturday, September 19th at the Riverfront
Park and First Security Amphitheater in Little Rock, AR.  </p>

</div></div>","Hello!

My name is Susie
Cowan, and I am a local business enthusiast. I am a founding member, the executive director, and the event planner for LoA Inc., which is the
non-profit that supports Legends of Arkansas. LoA Inc. has an amazing board of directors that have volunteered countless hours over the
last two years to help build this dream. We do this for the love of our community.
 
In May of 2013, on a
road trip to Nashville the dream of Legends of Arkansas was born. The concept
of using the fun of a family-friendly live music and art festival to promote
our local businesses sounded too good to be true. I'm not really sure how, but
just over three months later, on September 15th, we had the first all-Arkansas
music and art festival, Legends of Arkansas. It was wonderful. There were 20
bands, 3 stages, 30 art and craft vendors, performing artists and workshops all over the
place, and over 1000 attendees. In 2013, we had a $45,000 economic impact on
our River Market District according to the Little Rock Convention and Visitor
Bureau. There were more than a few challenges, but there were even more sweet
moments making it all worth it. 
Before the dust had
even settled, we started planning Legends of Arkansas 2014. On May 30th, 2014, we had the second Legends of Arkansas, all-Arkansas Music and Art Festival. It
rained on and off all day long, and we still had over 5000 attendees. There
were four stages this year, over 40 bands, over 50 art and craft vendors, and over
5000 attendees. Our economic impact in 2014 was $159,000. 
So here we are now in
2015 planning for 10,000 to 20,000 attendees, which should more than double the
economic impact in the River Market District. There will be 2 stages including
the History Pavilion and the First Security Amphitheater. So far this year

<p>My name is Jon Coley; I’m a singer/songwriter from Chester, in the North West of
England. Before anything else, I would like to thank you for taking the time to look
over and support my first ever crowd funding campaign. We are looking to raise
£3500 in order for me to create my first ever studio EP - Raincloudman, and release
a lot of other content along the way, including both a live album and live action
videos.
</p>
<p>I’ve been writing music for around 4 years now, and for me, it is both a great
emotional release and verbal communicator. I draw a lot of influence from both folk
artists like John Martyn and the early delta blues sound of people like Robert
Johnson, and much like them, I find it a lot easier to express myself through my
music than I do in conversation. Over the course of this period of time, I have
concentrated on writing and performing as much as I can, and have had some
amazing opportunities and experiences. I’ve self recorded and released 2 albums,
and had some really positive responses – the fact that other people tell me they can
relate to my music means so much to me, and has given me the drive to continue to
try and find new outlets for my songs.
</p>
<p>It is because of this that I have decided it is time to create my first studio EP. This is
really exciting for me, because it is my first chance to have you to truly hear my
songs the way I have always envisioned. I’ve managed to get together a fantastic
team of producers and musicians, and together we are working to give my songs a
new lease of life, rearranged and recorded in a way I have never done before.
</p>
<p>This is where I need your help. In return for your financial support, we have a list of
perks and exclusive content available for purchase. All funds raised will go towards
the creation of the Raincloudman EP. This means studio time, the producer, the engineer, the session musicians and the mixing and mastering of the EP. </p>
<p>They are as follows:
</p>
<p>£1 gets you a digital download of one of the 2 exclusive tracks I have recorded just
for this campaign and that won’t be available after it’s over.
</p>
<p>For £3, you will receive both of the exclusive tracks, as well a signed Raincloudman
A4 size poster.
</p>
<p>£5 gets you a digital copy of the Raincloudman EP, upon its release.
</p>
<p>To support my EP campaign, I’ve recorded a live album of songs, just me and my
guitar. For £10 you’ll receive a digital download of this album, as well as the
Raincloudman EP, upon its release.
</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p>£15 gets you a full digital release package, consisting on the live album,
Raincloudman EP, and the 2 exclusive campaign tracks. Included with this is a
signed A2 poster.
</p>
<p>For £20, you will receive the Digital download package, and 1 of 5 exclusive hand
drawn sketches. These will be mounted and of a very limited run.
</p>
<p>£40 gets you the digital download package, as well as a framed set of the guitar
strings I used to record the exclusive tracks or the live album. Only 2 of these will
ever be available.
</p>
<p>For £50, you will be able to receive the two exclusive campaign tracks as Side A + B
of a very limited Vinyl Pressing. I love Vinyl records, and I’m very pleased to be able
to offer my music in this format.
</p>
<p>As a perk for my campaign, I have made a one off leather bound book of the lyrics to
my songs. This is very personal to me and only one of these is available, priced at
£75.
</p>
<p>For a £100 contribution to my campaign, I’m offering the exclusive opportunity to
commission me to write a song. Your ideas will be used as inspiration and it can be
made with a specific person or subject in mind. This is a truly unique opportunity to
provide an entirely personal gift for a friend, loved one or family member. The song
will be recorded and sent to you via digital download or as a CD, at your request.
</p>
<p>For £200, you can purchase one of my guitars. I have owned and treasured this for
years, learning and writing much of what I’ve done on it. I hope it will serve you as
well as it has me.
</p>
<p>£275 gets you a commissioned song, written on the guitar described above, and the
guitar itself.
</p>
<p>For £300, you will receive a commissioned song. However, as well as the audio, you
will receive a personalised video of me performing it, with specific introductions and
dedications by request.
</p>
<p>For £350, I’ll perform a private 1 hour acoustic concert at your house. Terms and
conditions will apply, as travel and timescale may have to be factored in.
</p>
<p>£500 will get you the unique experience of spending the day with me at the recording
studio where I intend to create the Raincloudman EP. It’s located in the beautiful
Cheshire countryside, and while there we’ll have the opportunity to talk, write and
record music.
</p>
<p>An incredibly generous donation of £1000 would allow me to write a specifically
commissioned song for you, and have that song added to the Raincloudman EP. You
will also receive credit as co-writer. This is a truly unique opportunity to contribute to
a studio recorded and released EP, and have my entire audience listen to music you
helped inspire and create. Terms and conditions will apply, as legal details will have
to be worked out prior.
</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p>Finally, in return for a £2000 donation, the production company I am working with
(Stage:Life LTD) will organise and film an exclusive private event for you to invite all
of your friends and family, at which I will perform. Terms and conditions will apply, as
location and timing will have to be co-ordinated.
</p>
<p>To realise this project will mean the absolute world to me, and anything you can
give, no matter how much, is very much appreciated. Once again, thank you so much
for taking the time to read this, and for all of your generous support. </p>

Présentation
Saint-Hyacinthe, ce n'est pas que des champs à perte de vue, c'est aussi un sacré terreau fertile à l'art et à la musique. Ce que le Festival Agrirock tente de mettre de l'avant, c'est justement cette propension à la créativité propre à cette région.
Du 24 au 27 septembre prochain, musiciens et artistes multidisciplinaires prendront d'assaut le centre-ville de Saint-Hyacinthe pour le plus grand plaisir de ses passants et de ses festivaliers. Durant ces 3 jours, c'est plus de 20 groupes musicaux qui fouleront les planches d'une dizaine de lieux au centre-ville, sans compter les nombreuses activités gratuites qui s'y dérouleront.
Unique en son genre dans la région, Le Festival Agrirock est un incontournable pour quiconque aime l'art et la découverte. Issu de la collaboration entre divers acteurs régionaux, cet événement ne pourrait voir le jour sans la complicité des artistes, artisans, du public et des commerçant.e.s. 
De plus, entièrement financé de façon indépendante, Le Festival Agrirock compte sur une solide équipe de bénévoles passionné.e.s et compétent.e.s. Nous travaillons durant toute l'année sur ce projet d'envergure afin de présenter à nos spectateurs un événement de qualité.
Il est à noter que l'entièreté des profits du Festival servent à rémunérer les artistes qui en font partie.

Pourquoi nous aider?
Nous avons besoin d'aide financière parce que :

Nous travaillons de façon bénévole et indépendante. 
Tous les profits générés par le Festival vont directement aux artistes invité.e.s.
Nous tenons à coeur la diffusion de la culture dans la région de Saint-Hyacinthe.
Nous tentons d'augmenter le nombres d'activités proposées pour cet 3e édition.

Pour y arriver, nous avons besoin de votre soutien financier afin de :

Assurer une rémunération adéquate aux groupes / artistes invité.e.s.
Mettre en place une campagne de visibilité à grand déploiement pour rejoindre un maximum de spectateurs potentiels.
Attirer des artistes d'envergure internationale. 
Augmenter les activités extérieures gratuites (spectacles instores, foodtruck, librairie roulante, etc.).
Assurer la tenue d'une 4e édition en 2016.

Toute contribution servira ces buts et permettra la mise en place de ces objectifs à divers degrés dépendamment de l'atteinte ou non de l'objectif visé.

Created and hosted by Peter Pinho, PPRN Radio is broadcast twice a week over seven Internet channels with live, unscripted and uncensored programs that mixes politically incorrect humor and provocative conversation with live music performances. The result is invigorating, sometimes outrageous and always entertaining.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>After three years on the air, PPRN Radio needs to upgrade its operations to a new level. For the first time ever, PPRN Radio is asking its listeners to help alleviate some of the costs that go into producing a twice-a-week live four-hour show. </p>
<p>As a result of this fundraising effort, PPRN Radio will be able to purchase new microphones, a new sound board and other audio technology. PPRN Radio is also planning to upgrade its online presence with a new website, and it is exploring the possibility of adding a video component to its broadcasts.</p>
<p>As a special thank you, PPRN Radio is offering a series of gifts to listeners that are able to help us in this fundraising effort.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div> <p>Have you ever turned on the radio and then turned it off because you tired of hearing the same music for the 50 millionth time, or because you were bored by the monotonous conversation on so-called talk radio, or because the comedy by the allegedly funny DJs was dull? PPRN Radio strives to bring new energy, new talent and original humor to its audiences.  And many of the performers that are guests on PPRN Radio are making their first-ever broadcast appearances - we've lost track of the number of new singers, comics and filmmakers that we've introduced to radio listeners.</p>
<p>Our mission is to bring a new era in online entertainment to people seeking something fresh, bold and different.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We realize that money is tight and many people have other priorities that require their financial attention.  But we hope that you can find a way to offer a donation that will help keep PPRN Radio online for years to come.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. Please share our link - PPRNLiveRadio.com - with your friends and please help spread the word about this campaign.  Truly, every little bit of kindness helps us to achieve our goals.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Thank you all for taking time to check out my campaign.  Alot of you are probably wondering who I am, why I chose the picture that I did and more importantly, why I am looking for funding for music creation if I am already a DJ.  Those are all great questions and I plan to answer them, so lets get started.</p>
<p>A bit about the man that is The Fennec:</p>
<p>He was born April 19th, 1983 in Thunderbay, Ontario, Canada and spent most of his life roaming throughout Ontario.  Back around the end of 2011 him and his dear friend Nakomis, started a “club” in an popular social community “game” called Second Life.  It was just after the opening of this “club” called Frosty Nights Entertainment or Club FNE for short, that she persuaded Spirit to give djing a chance.  After a few sets he started to fall in love with the job and kept it up since then.  Sadly near the end of 2011 Nakomis passed on and Club FNE was passed on to Spirit.  He carried out the club as best he could but inevitably had to close down.  During this time, Spirit was in talks with his new friend, Koda, the blind tribal Otter, in regards to moving from Ontario to British Columbia back near the middle of 2012, and in no time the deal was finalized and Spirit was on his way to leaving everything he ever knew and to explore the beautiful west side of Canada.</p>
<p>In no time at all Spirit, became accustomed to his new surroundings filled with beautiful mountains and trees as far as the eye can see, and as breathtaking as it was, Spirit still felt restless and like he was missing something.  It seems that the call of djing was being ever so loud in his mind and he decided again to start up a “Club” in Second Life now called “The Cove”, and with the help and effort of Koda, and many others (Including a generous donation from Sarah Hibbert to get the Sim procured) the beautiful club atmosphere that is the sim affectionately known as “Eternal Spirit” was made giving birth to the relaxed feeling SL (Second Life) club that is “The Cove”.</p>
<p>As for Spirit?  What more is there to say?  He comes from a long line of rare but highly regarded music teachings (6th in line directly from Franz Liszt’s teachings) and has had a real passion for music for as long as he can remember.  Music is a passion and a lifestyle to him, regardless of what any other musician or musical artist says, he feels there is a place and time for every genre and style of music out there.  One thing he feels many people have forgotten is; music is a language of expression, while some may not approve of a specific language or style of speech  it is not for any one man to judge how another expresses their thoughts.  It is the right of each and every person to embrace how they best connect with that expression.</p>
<p>Really that’s all there is to be said, hes a man who is who he is.  He doesn’t expect everyone to embrace or love him, but he doesn’t expect someone to expect him to change to their liking either.  If you want to know more about him, feel free to contact him or hit him up.</p>
<p><strong>Comments From Others</strong></p>
<p>Interesting writeup. Here’s an excerpt from grandpa’s history:<br/>“Robert Loeffler continued with his concert studies in Detroit for the following six years with John Harrison, who was the assistant to the distinguished concert pianist Micha Kothler. Since Mr. Kothler studied with Emil von Sauer, who was the last pupil of Franz Liszt, these gentlemen, were indirectly all a great influence in the training of Mr. Loeffler.”<br/>I think you are actually 6th in line: 1) Franz Liszt to Emil von Sauer, 2) Emil von Sauer to Micha Kothler, 3) Micha Kothler to John Harrison, 4) John Harrison to Robert Loeffler, 5) Robert Loeffler to Nancy Loeffler, 6) Nancy Loeffler to YOU.</p>
<p>Quoting from your info:<br/>“One thing he feels many people have forgotten is music is a language of expression, while some may not approve of a specific language or style of speach, it is not for any one man to judge how another expresses their thoughts. It is the right of each and every person to embrace how they best connect with that expression.” Regarding approving of a specific language or style of speech, perhaps the distinguishing differences refer to the complexity of the music and the ability of the artist. Electronics radically changed the scene of long accepted standards.  Keep up the good work!”</p>
<p>-Ken Loeffler</p>So that covers who I am and partly why I chose my image as I did. I prefer to perform in a more unique manner just like DeadMau5 and others before him, in the guise of a fennec fox, as they have large ears and hear everything around them, much like an average DJ should.<p>I am a radio DJ currently with some experimentation into music creation but I feel that I still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Through your funding and support I will be able to further that with equipment and further training.  Imagine this, YOU yes YOU would be responsible for a new artist emerging into the music industry and I have not forgotten my roots thus far and would never forget the support you all would show.  This means staying in touch and remembering that I couldn't be where I am without all of you.  So for that many incentives will be setup to show you just how appreciative I am.  YOUR contributions help mold the way for music, radio broadcasting and puts you in the directors chair as I would want to consult with each and every one of you for ideas for new music and releases.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>In order for us to accomplish what I am setting out to do, I have put the goal at $2000.00.  This would cover the costs of newer equipment, laptops new sound boards, mixers and some basic learning and upgrading of my current knowledge.  The costs may be more in the end but we need to start somewhere.</p>
<p>Now lets cut to the chase, ""What's in it for me if I contribute?"" some of you may ask. That is a great question so lets examine it a bit more.</p>
<p>How would you like exclusive access to tracks that will never be released to the public? Consistent updates and 1st chance at grabs for tickets to any of my performance at possibly a reduced or no cost?  How would you like music tracks with shout-outs and dedication directly to you?  Or maybe you want to ask a favor like needing a love song made for your soon to be fiance?  The possibilities are endless and I plan to accommodate as much as possible to you for being one of my backers.</p>
<p>""$2000.00 is alot of money, what if you don't meet your goal?  Will the funding be wasted?""</p>
<p>Absolutely not, any and all funding will go towards this project and regardless, I plan to honor any and all funding perks regardless of the turnout.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>So, why is this campaign important?  Simply put, it allows for new music to hit and a DJ that remembers that music is about performing for the audience, NOT for himself.  This means more types of mixes and songs that are attuned to what YOU want to hear.</div>
<div>""Well so far I like what I hear, but what kind of a track record do you have?""  Great question!  Since 2013 I have launched and maintained The Cove Radio online radio station with alot of support from people just like you!  One of our contributors/investors, donated over $20,000 after just 2 meetings because he saw the value and importance of the work I am trying to do.  Those funds are still furthering the station and I plan to keep that work going for years to come.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Like with anything, there are some risks and challenges as a DJ or a musician, there is no denying that.  So many new DJs and musicians come out every day it seems.  So what sets me apart from the others and what will I do to overcome them?  Simple, unlike many other DJs I have The Cove Radio as my backing, I will always have an outlet to continue my work and share it with the world, something you will always be remembered and a part of.  I had people in past try very hard to destroy the hard work I put into The Cove Radio Ltd. and yet here it still stands, government agencies looked into the operations and found everything being done by the books as I always maintain.  So if the government of Canada, can trust the work I do, then you can too.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help!  If you want to help but just don't have the funding then try spreading the word about this campaign.  Share it with the social media links, ask your friends to do the same, odds are from every 20 people you tell about me, one of them will be able to help support the campaign.</p>

What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:
In order for us to accomplish what I am setting out to do, I have put the goal at $2000.00.  This would cover the costs of newer equipment, laptops new sound boards, mixers and some basic learning and upgrading of my current knowledge.  The costs may be more in the end but we need to start somewhere.
Now lets cut to the chase, ""What's in it for me if I contribute?"" some of you may ask. That is a great question so lets examine it a bit more.
How would you like exclusive access to tracks that will never be released to the public? Consistent updates and 1st chance at grabs for tickets to any of my performance at possibly a reduced or no cost?  How would you like music tracks with shout-outs and dedication directly to you?  Or maybe you want to ask a favor like needing a love song made for your soon to be fiance?  The possibilities are endless and I plan to accommodate as much as possible to you for being one of my backers.
""$2000.00 is alot of money, what if you don't meet your goal?  Will the funding be wasted?""
Absolutely not, any and all funding will go towards this project and regardless, I plan to honor any and all funding perks regardless of the turnout.   The Impact
So, why is this campaign important?  Simply put, it allows for new music to hit and a DJ that remembers that music is about performing for the audience, NOT for himself.  This means more types of mixes and songs that are attuned to what YOU want to hear.
""Well so far I like what I hear, but what kind of a track record do you have?""  Great question!  Since 2013 I have launched and maintained The Cove Radio online radio station with alot of support from people just like you!  One of our contributors/investors, donated over $20,000 after just 2 meetings because he saw the value and importance of the work I am trying to do.  Those funds are still furthering the station and I plan to keep that work going for years to come.   Risks & Challenges Like with anything, there are some risks and challenges as a DJ or a musician, there is no denying that.  So many new DJs and musicians come out every day it seems.  So what sets me apart from the others and what will I do to overcome them?  Simple, unlike many other DJs I have The Cove Radio as my backing, I will always have an outlet to continue my work and share it with the world, something you will always be remembered and a part of.  I had people in past try very hard to destroy the hard work I put into The Cove Radio Ltd. and yet here it still stands, government agencies looked into the operations and found everything being done by the books as I always maintain.  So if the government of Canada, can trust the work I do, then you can too.   Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help!  If you want to help but just don't have the funding then try spreading the word about this campaign.  Share it with the social media links, ask your friends to do the same, odds are from every 20 people you tell about me, one of them will be able to help support the campaign.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h4>Pasado</h4>
<p>Nos conocimos en un concierto de Anathema en el 2009 en Barcelona y al poco tiempo ya nos encontramos haciendo música. <br/>Buscamos batería durante varios meses pero al ver que no había nadie con el mismo nivel de motivación decidimos tirar por la electrónica. Y así fue como con un formato de guitarra, bajo, voz y electrónica lanzamos la primera demo, The Sounds of our Suffocation, y al poco tiempo y decididos a hacer de nuestro arte nuestro futuro compusimos un CD de 10 temas llamado Crystal, que fue promocionado a través de unbia serie de Micro-Conciertos en Barcelona.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Presente</h4>
<p>Decidimos alejarnos de la ciudad y apostar por un entorno mas natural y aquí estamos,  en una casita en el Montseny con un CD auto-editado a punto de mezclar y masterizar. Y planeando nuestro siguiente paso, que sera llevar nuestro trabajo a Berlín a principios de verano. Nuestra próxima gran aventura!</p>
<h4>La Idea y Recompensas Exclusivas</h4>
<p>Hemos pensado que como el CD ya está obsoleto, hacer una primera edición de  Mini-Books en calidad fotográfica donde adjuntaremos nuestro arte, letras y ademas el arte de otros artistas que estén interesados, nos gusten o estén en harmonía con lo que hacemos. Trabajar juntos para expandir el arte por donde estemos, primera parada, Berlin!</p>
<p>Otra idea que pensamos es hacer camisetas con un diseño de un artista que escojamos de un mini concurso dedicado a todos los mecenas interesados en participar y que quieran formar parte de nuestra imagen.</p>
<p>Y por último, haremos un USB para quien quiera un formato físico, en lugar del CD.</p>
<blockquote>*Las recompensas que ofrecemos en general para los mecenas serán musica, las Mini-Books, camisetas y usb</blockquote>

name is <b>Elijah Rock</b> and I have been singing the Great American Songbook for over 15 years. Now it's time for me to record
my debut Jazz Traditional Pop album entitled, <b>""GERSHWIN FOR THE SOUL.""</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Before moving to Los Angeles, I cut my teeth in New York City, starring in a Swing review called, <i>""Things are Still What They Used to Be""</i>  with my 7-piece Swing Band! I even got to tour with a 21-piece big band in the musical <i>""Forever Swing.""  </i>Upon moving to Los Angeles, I formed a jazz ensemble, <i>The Downtown Project</i>, where we had a residency at the Edison Club in downtown Los Angeles for over a year. For
the past few years, I've Headlined the
KJAZZ (88.1)FM Hollywood and Highland Summer Concert Series in Los
Angeles with my little big band. Recently, I packed the
house with my Jazz Cabaret at the Colony Theater, in Burbank. <b>The
timing couldn't be BETTER!</b></p>

In
April of 2015, I played the role of 'The Crooner' in the Los Angeles
Premier of the musical play, <i>""Words by Ira

got to sing songs like <i>""Isn't It A Pity,"" ""They All

The Lowdown





My
name is Elijah Rock and I have been singing the Great American Songbook for over 15 years. Now it's time for me to record
my debut Jazz Traditional Pop album entitled, ""GERSHWIN FOR THE SOUL.""


Before moving to Los Angeles, I cut my teeth in New York City, starring in a Swing review called, ""Things are Still What They Used to Be""  with my 7-piece Swing Band! I even got to tour with a 21-piece big band in the musical ""Forever Swing.""  Upon moving to Los Angeles, I formed a jazz ensemble, The Downtown Project, where we had a residency at the Edison Club in downtown Los Angeles for over a year. For
the past few years, I've Headlined the
KJAZZ (88.1)FM Hollywood and Highland Summer Concert Series in Los
Angeles with my little big band. Recently, I packed the
house with my Jazz Cabaret at the Colony Theater, in Burbank. The
timing couldn't be BETTER!


In
April of 2015, I played the role of 'The Crooner' in the Los Angeles
Premier of the musical play, ""Words by Ira
Gershwin,"" also at the prestigious Colony Theatre. I
got to sing songs like ""Isn't It A Pity,"" ""They All
Laughed,"" ""Love Walked In,"" ""Fascinating Rhythm,""
and more!

I
FELL IN LOVE WITH THE MUSIC OF GEORGE AND IRA GERSHWIN!












George
Gershwin wrote most of his vocal and theatrical works, including more
than a dozen Broadway shows and several films in collaboration with
his elder brother, lyricist Ira Gershwin. George’s musical
compositions have been used in numerous films and on television, and
many became jazz standards recorded in numerous variations.





About
the Project


I couldn't resist the idea of transforming our LIVE experience with ""Words"" into
an ALBUM recording! I had so much fun singing these amazing songs
every night for 2 months LIVE and in the THEATRE! Who get's that
kind of opportunity these days? It's an opportunity of a LIFETIME to
record this album. The show closed on May 24th, so it's still fresh and
in our minds, bodies and SOULS!

Hey everyone! My name is Shannon Kennedy and along with U-Nam, we are Groove LTD. 
We are so thrilled to announce that we’re getting ready to put the final touches on our first album. 
We’ve been hard at work in the studio the past few months, preparing this project for you and it’s currently in the mixing stage, so this campaign is going to be a bit different than some of the other album campaigns out there. 
With this campaign, we’re asking you to help us fund the mastering, manufacturing, and marketing (such as radio promotion and ads). And the great news is, because the album is close to completion, we’ll have a lot of great stuff to share with you sooner so that you don’t have to wait long to hear what we’ve been up to. 
In exchange for pre-ordering the album (and some of the other awesome incentives we’re offering), you’ll help us with the final stages of our project. And helping us fund this campaign will get the music and tons of other great stuff that won’t be offered elsewhere into your hands before anyone else! 
We want you to be a part of our team and to be a part of the making of this album! 

We have a first class lineup with us on the project including chart topping keyboardist Jonathan Fritzen, soulstress Maysa Leak, Neo-Soul singer Myron Davis, and the legendary percussionist, Paulinho DaCosta, drummer, Michael White (George Benson, Maze etc..), steel drums superstar, Andy Narell, bassist, Dwayne “Smitty” Smith (Boney James, Isley Brothers…), and many more...""It's Only Love"" Official Music Video 
Make sure you check out the incentives for our project - there’s a lot of really fun and unique items including the saxophone from the “It’s Only Love” music video, exclusive versions of tracks, signed CDs, Skype Lessons and even a private Google Hangout acoustic show for you and your friends. 
We’re also going to include the mp3 download of “It’s Only Love” as a gift to everyone who contributes to the project which will be available for immediate download. It was the album’s first single and it saw a lot of success and airplay worldwide. And whether or not you choose to contribute, we’d really appreciate your helping us share this campaign with your friends!




U-Nam and I are so excited to be on this new adventure with you. Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts for all your love and support! We love you all! www.grooveltd.com There is a sneak peek preview of some of the new songs in the campaign video :) ...Did you check it out yet ?
""First Class"" digital album download will be available approximately 3 weeks before the physical CD.

</div><p>Hi there, my name is Evan Diamond. I am 19 years old and am
originally from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Last year my parents and I decided to
relocate to Southern California so that I could pursue my dream of being a songwriter
and performing artist.</p>
<p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. My dad introduced
me to the music of his generation which included so many of the greatest bands
of all time. When he first played me some Beatles tunes I completely fell in
love and they are still my favorite band to this day.  My mother’s musical tastes were more along the
lines of folk rock icons like Carole King and James Taylor, influences which I
am pleased to incorporate into my own musical style. </p>
<p>I would say I finally realized my passion to be a musician
when I was in university. Growing up I never seemed to fit in. I was bullied in
school for being different and unfortunately my struggle to be part of the
crowd followed me to university as well. Along with that, about a week before
my 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, a very dear friend and mentor of mine passed away.
I couldn’t get out of bed for a week after that. However, after spending a day
scrolling through the internet I found a song by Demi Lovato called Nightingale
and I actually broke down in tears at how much the song touched me after just
one listen. Her lyrics resonated with me and made me realize that I wasn’t
alone. That’s when it all really clicked for me. I wanted to do that. I wanted
someone to turn on my music when they were feeling down or alone and have it touch
their hearts. </p>
<p>After that I began to write songs and melodies on my guitar.
It was a way to get my feelings out so I didn’t just drown in negative emotion but
found myself able to deal with my issues in a much more positive way. I just
kept writing, not necessarily sad songs, but stories, about love, happiness,
loss, anything that I was feeling or inspired me and made me want to tell other
people about. It is my ultimate hope that no matter who you are or what you’re
going through, you can turn on my music and start to feel even a little bit
better and possibly be inspired to find the passion that lies within you, as I
found mine.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434838309/zwaplrun7hnk7eckzmr7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>That is why I am launching this campaign to raise enough
money to take the best of my material and record an EP so that my music can
reach a much wider audience and hopefully have the same impact on them as other
songwriters have had on me. I can only do that with your help!</p>
<p>I’m looking to raise $15,000 to produce and record this EP
with 5 to 6 of my songs. That includes musicians, studio time, mixing and
mastering plus manufacturing and distribution all under the watchful eye of my
producer and mentor Jimmy Gnecco of the band Ours. </p>
<p>For helping us achieve this goal, I have created a number of
awesome and limited edition merchandise and perks ranging from a personalized
thank you to lifetime VIP passes to all my concerts. </p>
<p>If I am unable to achieve my full campaign goal I will still
utilize the proceeds from the campaign towards the production of the EP with
fewer songs. I have no intention of giving up on this project.  </p>
<p>Over the course of this year I have been invited to perform at multiple
venues in San Diego and Los Angeles including the World Famous San Diego Fair at Del Mar,
Knott’s Berry Farm, Lestat's West and 9 on Vine in Hollywood. I’ve also appeared as a guest
numerous times on internet radio station Restless Nation Radio, which airs worldwide. Mike Wearren, the show’s host said, “You’ve
got to see her folks. She’s one of those artists you really have to see live to
see the emotion and expression she gives in her performances.” </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434838360/c3fhbnjn6xbyvfnt0yf9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Your donations will be instrumental in funding the EP but if
we are able to raise additional money it will be utilized towards additional
recording and touring expenses. </p>
<p>My parents and brother have always been my strongest
supporters for everything that I have done in my life. During the difficult
times when I found it so hard to relate to kids my own age, my brother Eli was
always there to take me under his wing and look out for me. Now he has
continued to be my great big brother, having helped me to get me an
introduction, through an associate, to Jimmy Gnecco, a phenomenal singer and leader of the band Ours. When Jimmy called me after
having received some live performance videos of my songs and told me how much
he enjoyed my music and how pleased he would be to work with me I felt so
excited and extremely validated. Jimmy Gnecco is an amazingly talented, beautiful and
giving individual and it has been a privilege to be able to work with him. It’s
not every day you get to work with someone who has a song written about him by
Lana Del Rey. </p>
<p>I have also been fortunate to work with other excellent
vocal coaches here in San Diego.  I am currently working with Steve Grey Romande who has helped me immeasurably in developing my vocal style.  He has an
extensive Broadway performance background. </p>
<p>As mentioned before, my parents are also two of my biggest
supporters. Recently things have been difficult for us financially which is
another reason why I am launching this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>I hope that everybody who visits my campaign is able to give
even just a dollar but if you choose there are other very important
ways you can assist my campaign which include spreading the word through social
media, word of mouth and attending any of my concerts to support my music
directly. </p>

others deal with regularly.  </p>
<p>My parents always emphasized to my brother and I that life
is a pursuit of passion whatever form it takes so that you can be a participant
rather than a spectator in life. Everyone can pursue their own unique dreams in
order to add life’s meaning the way music has done for me. At the end of the
day, I want to try to touch people’s hearts and lift people up with my songs
the way artists' music has always inspired and been there for me. I hope you
will contribute to my fundraising endeavor so that I have the financial ability
to record my EP and enable me to reach a much wider audience with my music. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435010698/r7t7riptgkafhdtpc7ml.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

(Please note: as amazing as it would be, we have not been asked by The Gaslight Anthem to produce this video. All campaigning is unaffiliated with the band, no copyright infringement intended.)



It's Yersel Media and Orange Tip Productions are two teen production companies collaborating on what we hope will be an amazing project. Most of us met on a regional BFI Film Academy course in Edinburgh last year and as a crew cannot wait to get back behind the camera again.
This project is a little different to what we're used to, but with your help, a little perseverance and lots of laughs, we're certain we can pull it off. What we're hoping to produce is a short film/music video for New Jersey rock band, The Gaslight Anthem's, song  'Underneath The Ground.' The song, we believe, tells a very important story about life, what lies ahead, and what we leave behind. You can look at it from many different angles- every song means something different to each individual- but we would love to share with you our take, through this video production. 
The script is well underway and our shoot will take place between Friday 21st and Sunday 23rd of August 2015 in Edinburgh and the surrounding areas.



Meet The Team!

Writer/Director/Producer: Beth M. Cameron
Executive Producers: Jojo Johnstone, Jamie “McCarron”
Thomson
Director of Photography: Edward Kondracki
Hair/Makeup/Costumes: Rebecca Collins
Crew: Michael Shaw, Innes Goodall, Nathan Pearson, Cleo
Denholm, Bruce Scott
Cast (so far!): Nichole MJ Cook, Innes
Ramsay, Ruairidh Keiller, Liam Henderson
How Can You Help Us?

 We are looking for small donations to go towards our shoot weekend (filming can be a little pricey...and there's only so far summer job money can go!). Any funds raised will go directly towards   
Travel: many of the team live outside of the city and will have to travel into Edinburgh each day of the shoot. We will also have to travel from location to location either by car or bus. Petrol and fare money would be handy. 
Location bookings: some of the locations we have booked into (e.g. music studios, rehearsal rooms) charge for the use of the space. 
Props, Makeup & Costumes: most of this we will likely already have through borrowing and lending, however some purchases may have to be made for certain scenes. 

Catering: Although we are unable to pay our actors for their work, we'd like to be able to pay for their meals throughout the weekend. Any left over funds, will go towards food and drink for the crew. Hungry film crew= sad/grumpy/unproductive film crew.

Music: We may purchase some royalty free tracks to place in the opening scenes of the video. Sometimes these are free of charge but most require a payment.

Publicity: If our fundraising campaign is successful, we may use spare funds to spread the word about the finished project via social media ads etc.     What's In It For You? We'd like to offer you some perks after you donate. These are still in progress...more are on the way! So far our perks range from your name in the credits to a first look at the video. Also if you live close enough, we can offer you free hugs for being so kind to donate to this project!
    Risks & Challenges As excited as we are to get started on this project, we do realise that we are going to reach some hurdles. As with any film shoot, there's the possibility that we may not get all of the filming done in the one weekend and the project will be postponed, however we are optimistic that it will run smoothly. If we stick to a nice schedule we'll hopefully have everything done and ready for you all to see by late September!

<p><b>My Story:</b></p><p><b>Hello, my name is Megan Leonardo. I am a 24 year old singer/songwriter,
originally from Montauk, New York, but a recent Austin, Texas transplant. For
the past 3 years, I have been working the amateur performance circuit,
showcasing my love of music and performing around the local and statewide
scene. I’ve performed in a number of festivals and showcases, and have even
played a SXSW showcase and was featured as the winner for the United Auto Insurance jingle contest in Chicago!
</b></p><b>
</b><p><br/>
</p><p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<p>My campaign is incredibly important to building my career as
a singer/songwriter. I created this crowdfund project to help raise money to further
my musical career. My sound and genre has changed over the past few years, and
I have been working to build my fanbase. Unfortunately, without having a few
really great albums to produce and distribute, having fans can only go so far
in getting recognized and moving forward!</p>
<p><b>What I Need:</b></p>
<p>I am
attempting to raise $5,000 to make a new album with full production in a
professional studio. I have connected with Westfall Recording Company, who has
worked with artists on major labels like Sony. My sound has changed since I
released my first LP, and I am looking to make a album that has more of my
""grown up"" sound that actually got me booked at several larger-scale
festivals and showcases. The $5,000 will be used to record and produce 6 songs
with full production, including studio musicians. </p>
<p>My
long-term goal with this campaign and the album production is to start
submitting my music to labels and agents. I've been starting to build a lot of
hype, but haven't been able to hang onto it as much for lack of recordings.
This would put me over the edge and give me a chance to get where I need to be
in my career. </p>
<p><b>How You Can Help:</b></p>
<p>If you
can’t make a donation at this time, you can still help support my growing
career! Please take a moment and share my campaign and information with your
family and friends via social media, email, and word of mouth. With your help I
can raise the funding necessary to get my album produced and distributed for a
wider audience, and hopefully connect with a label!</p>

I also am looking forward to bringing in as many other musicians on vocals and instrumentals as possible.  All of these are people I've been fortunate to share both stage and studio with over the course of my music career in Boston. This is where you come in....  Studio time is costly and that time determines the production possibilities for the songs.  The more resources I have to work with, the more we'll be able to give each song the arrangement it deserves.  In addition to guitar and bass, the sounds of fiddle, banjo, dobro and mandolin are already reverberating in my head.
Your contribution will allow me to continue to share my music, not just locally, but beyond.  Anything you can offer will be deeply appreciated.  And PLEASE pass this along to anyone you know who might also be interested.

</p><p>Hey folks!  We are Abalone Grey, an up and coming Americana band based out of Santa Cruz, CA.  During the past 6 months, we’ve made a lot of amazing new discoveries.  First, we discovered each other.  Like moths to a light in the dark, we were all drawn together by a love for music and the astounding talent we all saw in each other.  Though each one of us has our own distinctive skills and sound, together we have formed something much greater than the sum of the parts.  A collective energy has created Abalone Grey, and our newest discovery is that the same energy has brought us to the stage in a band’s life when it needs to spread its wings and take to the road.  But we need your help!  Our dream is to share our music with the world, so please help us get on the road for our very first tour through the Northwestern United States!</p>
<p>Our humble entourage consists of Bobcat Rob Armenti (guitar, vocals), Luke Kinney (mandolin, vocals), Kat Factor (guitar, vocals, washboard), Emma Shaw (upright bass, vocals), and Noah Freedman (fiddle, vocals).  As you can see, we all love to sing, but what makes us truly unique is the fact that every member brings forward new songs and ideas which leads to the creation of collectively constructed music.  We are absolutely in love with the art of music making, and we hope you can hear our passion in our sound.</p>
<p>Below is our currently planned tour starting off in our home town of Santa Cruz at the Crepe Place on September 9th and ending at the Lost Sierra Hoedown in Johnsville, CA on September 25th.</p>

<div><br/></div> <p></p>The Liberation Music Collective is a socially-conscious big band dedicated to performing original compositions about contemporary social issues. We're currently making our first studio album, <i>Siglo XXI</i>. Our goal is to bring a fresh 21st-century approach to the tradition of protest music in jazz, following in the footsteps of Charlie Haden, Max Roach, Charles Mingus, and many others. In addition to the jazz canon, we draw from the plurality of genres present in America, including hip-hop, Afro-Cuban music, Sacred Harp hymns, Islamic liturgy, and post-modern classical music. By focusing on social issues and embracing this plurality of styles within a jazz context, we hope to bring jazz back into the socially provocative music of our era.<p></p> </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We're recording our first studio album, <i>Siglo XXI</i>. Earlier in May, we had a whirlwind week of rehearsals, a live gig, and our days in the studio. Now we're in the mixing and mastering process. We received grant money from our university to cover costs up to this point, but we want this music to reach the world--and that means hiring professional promotion and manufacturing physical CDs with album artwork and liner notes, which is not cheap!

<p>1. Murasaki: a tribute to Lady Murasaki Shikibu, who is credited with writing the world's first novel (The Tale of Genji), and to all the women whose contributions to the arts and to humanity continue to go unsung.</p>
<p><br/>2. War Department: based on a Sacred Harp Hymn of the same name, this blistering free jazz arrangement explores the absurdity and confusion in war and our continuous failure as a society to escape its cycle.</p>
<p><br/>3. Bismillah: this song is a tribute to the beautiful and peaceful activists in Islam who work simultaneously against Islamic extremists and Islamophobes.</p>
<p> <br/>4. El Viento: a contrafact of ""Baba Fururu,"" a Santerían hymn to the deity of justice and wisdom Obatalá, that explores immigration justice in the U.S.</p>
<p><br/>5. Interitus: this tour de force chronicles humanity’s relationship with the planet earth, from our start in primordial pools, to the apogee of civilization, to our mismanagement and desecration of the environment into inevitable disaster.</p>
<p> <br/>6. Child's Song for an Incarcerated Parent: based on the hymn ""Father I Adore You,"" this piece is an exploration of the emotional tumult of having a parent in a U.S. prison (a reality that far too many children in our country experience).</p>
<p><br/>7. Wedding Hymn: a meditation on the love and devotion  expressed between LGBTQ+ couples—and a miniature narrative about the struggle for marriage equality and against homophobia worldwide.</p>
<p><br/>8. Herstory: a raging feminist manifesto that still manages not to be about man-hating (calm down already).</p>
<p><br/>9. Black &amp; Red: words fail us when trying to express our grief and outrage at racial profiling and police brutality in this country, but hopefully this song begins to give voice to that pain. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Alexandra Klausner and in 2017 - under the full moon - I transformed into Werekitten! She's my music alter-ego who follows her dreams, gets signed to labels, and inspires others to dance so hard they lose their underwear.</p>
<p>When I started making music I never imagined my songs would go anywhere other than my living room - let alone a music label! I’m joyful, in disbelief, and ready to embark on this next adventure. My voice was lowered to sound like a man but it makes the video that much more fun!</p>

<p>Hey everyone! <a href=""https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/one-woman-show/content?oid=24177179"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My name is Danielle</a>. I founded and produce First Festival (<a href=""http://www.firstfestivalsacramento.com/team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">with a little help from some good friends</a>). The 1st three years have been funded by ticket sales and vendor booths, but it was always my intention to make the festival <strong>FREE</strong> for everyone to attend. This campaign will help do that and I'm so excited to finally fulfill that mission. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494957935/wz4dhl980fxnc0wocaw3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This campaign is not only important to me, it's important to the community-- to the artists, to the musicians, to the comics, to everyone! First Fest celebrates the local arts scene in a way that hasn't been done in our community prior. It creates a platform for local artists to reach audiences that they would never have access to otherwise. But, most importantly, it shows Sacramento all of the home grown talent that exists <strong>right here in our region</strong>. First Fest proves that local talent can support a weekend long music festival. </p>
<p>Festivals are expensive.  We've built the foundation over the last three years and now it's ready to go out to the community in exchange for an epic weekend that doesn't cost a dime for those who attend. We're in this together and I know we'll come out on top. I believe in us.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know what you're thinking. <strong>$60,000 is A LOT of money</strong>. You're right. It is. But this is what it's taken each year to fund the festival. It's been done through ticket sales, vendor booths, up-selling, credit cards, trading, in-kind donations, loans-- you name it. For the 4th year, we need to look at other options.</p>
<p> In 2017 we had over 3,000 people come through over the weekend. If each of those people donated $20, then this entire campaign would be funded. That's not too bad-- especially with perks at every donation level!</p>

<p>We've built this festival from the ground up doing everything it takes to create a solid, reliable foundation. Everything has been done in-house to push every dollar as far as it can go. Nothing is spent without critical evaluation. The same will go for these funds. Money will be spent critically and carefully. Every dollar will be respected.</p>
<h3>First Fest's Community Impact:</h3>
<p>First Fest is the first and only strictly local regional music festival in Sacramento. Our mission is to give local artists and musicians a platform to showcase their projects in a festival-venue. In 3 years, we've showcased nearly <a href=""http://www.firstfestivalsacramento.com/alumni/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">100 local bands</a> spanning all genres. We've showcased a ton of local artists from all backgrounds and who use all different mediums. In 2017 we introduced local comedy into the lineup, highlighting 10 local comedians, including a<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/highanxietyvarietyshow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> popular podcast</a>. We have seen nearly 200 vendors come through over the years including crafters, artists, makers, designers, local business, food trucks, food vendors, interactive booths-- you name it! Over the last 3 years we've featured over 100 different local beers on tap from local breweries-- <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1846449812342557/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vote on what we pour next year! </a><br/><br/>First Fest is about community first and foremost. We aren't funded and we aren't run by a corporation. We crowd source ideas and let the community vote on the beer selection and activities. We curate First Festival with Sacramento in mind <i>alongside</i> Sacramento. Always have and always will. Pre-fund with us and help keep First Festival alive in the Sacramento community for the year to come. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What happens if this campaign doesn't fund? Well, its likely that First Fest as we have come to know it may not happen. <strong>This fundraiser is critical</strong>. We can't financially support the event at the risk of our family and friends again. It's a hard truth we have to face and we're being 100% transparent. First Fest has always paid its bills. We've paid every artist contracted for payment on time and in full. We don't leave people high and dry and we honor our word. Always have and always will, no matter what. </p>
<p>So, if it doesn't fund enough, we'll throw the best party we can with what we have. It might be one day. It might be one stage. It might only be an evening. We REALLY hope we can throw the biggest First Fest yet, but it's all a numbers game. We will do <i>something</i> with whatever we raise, but we <strong>REALLY</strong> hope that it's another epic First Fest. I'm willing to put in the work if you're willing to help get us there. </p>

Our show’s aim is to bring the classical music to the big audience through our typical Italian theatrical passion.Following the suggestions of many of our lovely fans, we would like to take the next step for our duo and explore the new crossover’s world combining opera and cinema in a CD of  duets from movie’s sound tracks. LUCIA AND GIOVANNILucia Conte and Giovanni Palminteri  both have extensive experience in classical musical theatre and television.Lucia, opera trained soprano, from the little ‘heel’ of Italy, is the winner of international opera competitions including “Spiros Argiris” in Sarzana and “Rosetum” in Milan. She performed operatic leading roles in many Italian, European and Asian theatres, including Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Don Giovanni, La Bohème, L’Elisird’Amore, La Traviata, Rigoletto, Nabucco.Giovanni, opera trained tenor from Sicily has a varied career to date, including performances in  Opera Houses worldwide. He sang for important operatic and jazz festivals and events and in the Italian television. He has been company production manager on board Silversea Cruises Ltd.HOW CAN YOU HELP US?Your contribution is very important for the realization of this project because the costs of the production of an album are very high. We have set our funding goal at $15,000, that we will use for:- Production of a videoclip- Contruction of our website- Marketing and commercial on internet and press office- Production of original tracks + recording and mixing in studio with live orchestra- Album design We are making an effort to produce our cd by ourselves with an independent label, but this will be possible just with your help WHY MAKE A DONATION?All this kind of artistic jobs are about passion, that’s why we decided to call ourselves Passione.This is the real meaning of life for us, and passion for us is Music, the universal language that goes beyond any obstacles, any cultural difference. We feel very lucky to have been performing for some of you and we want to try to express what we have inside with this new project.We hope that if you have ever enjoyed one of our performances, you will consider donating to help us and keep a little piece of our heart with you forever. <3 <3 <3",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our story goes back to 2006 when I met my dear friend Magnus Reymert. We were studying music together at two Conservatories in the Netherlands and at that time we couldn’t imagine that in a few years time our paths would lead us to this amazing opportunity:</p>
<p>Joining both our orchestras together for an ultimate cooperation: Il Giardino d’Amore Orchestra from Vienna / Krakow and NOR 59 Youth Orchestra from Oslo. This meeting of two orchestras and exchange of two worlds is very energetic, exciting, full of new discoveries, exceptional, and to put it in one word I would say it’s simply: MYTHICAL! ;) Four years ago Magnus invited me to Oslo for the first time to meet the teenagers and kids from his orchestra. Since then we started working together intensively with our common goal and dream to awake sensitivity for art, especially music in young peoples hearts and to make classical music an important part of their existence. At this time it is not a simple task although we are going “like a storm”!</p>
<p>A multicultural exchange such as this particular one gives amazing, incomparable advantages to these young musicians who will gain their experience and develop opportunities to enter the professional music world, which for many others is still closed at their age. This interaction is very powerful, because it’s based on unconditional love for music, friendship, trust, communication, and quality time in discovering art.</p>
<p>Now we would love to give the result of our cooperation as a gift to the world! It’s comprised of our hard work and unstoppable passion. This recording would express this very unique moment of our lives, and will stay as a memory forever.</p>
<p><strong>EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH YOUR SUPPORT.</strong></p>
<p>This album titled the MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM will be your excellent companion during long summer starry nights, and will load you with positive energy on cold winter mornings. It will be professionally produced by our sound engineer in Krakow and planned to be released this Autumn.</p>
<p>With YOUR support we are able to make this unique project come true and you will be a fantastic ambassador for us! Joining a diverse group of musicians from multiple countries to create something unforgettable is simply priceless! Therefore with our deepest gratitude we would love to offer you something in return for your heart warming support:</p>
<p>-    Tickets for one of our concerts,</p>
<p>-    A signed physical copy of our album,</p>

<h3>The Story...</h3>
<p><i>Brooklyn, New York, September of 2015; a Minneapolis-bred rapper, having just moved to NYC after a year in residence at a yoga retreat center meets a veteran NYC funk/jazz singer from a family of skilled professional artists. The two discover a shared appreciation of New Orleans-style funk and hip-hop.  They decide to build a community on dance, mindfulness, inclusive and diverse community, conscious culture, and 'parties-with-a-purpose' in the form of a high-quality live band called <strong>Big Village Little City</strong>.</i></p>
<p>Since we set out to make <strong>BVLC</strong> a reality, we've gathered an incredibly talented tribe of musicians, hosted some beautiful live music experiences, and many amazing things have begun to happen, including - of course - <a href=""http://www.bigvillagelittlecity.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">some awesome music</a>. The next few steps are looking even more promising, but we'll need your help in order to make them happen!</p>
<p>Our song <strong>Snake Oil</strong> will be the first BVLC track to get the official music video treatment. The video plan is already mapped out, and the filmmaker is confirmed, but in order for the video to look the way we hope, we need your help taking care of the production expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Snake Oil</strong> is the perfect introductory track to <strong>Big Village Little City</strong>; shining light on human's desire to find the mysterious secret recipe that contains the remedy for all of life's sufferings. In truth, the <i>medicine</i> (read: ""<i>funk</i>"") is the freedom we already have to celebrate, dance, and join in community with those around us.</p>
<p>We will be touring around the northeast US in June, between performing at <a href=""https://wanderlust.com/artist/big-village-little-city/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wanderlust festivals</a>. This adventure will be called <strong>BVLC's Snake Oil Tour</strong>, because it is the first time we'll be able to bring the unique, healing 'medicine' that we offer through music and community to folks that live outside of the greater NYC area. <strong>Please help us make this tour happen</strong>! We are being as strategic as possible with our travel plans, but carting eight people around the country is no small feat no matter who you are.</p>

The list goes on, so please check the fun list of perks. So in effect, you become a midwife birthing this baby into existence. We are aiming to raise $8,000 to cover most of the costs of the whole project.This covers the artwork, printing, pressing, musicians, recording, mixing and mastering. To put your mind at ease, unlike some Crowd Fundraisers, we WILL make this album even if we don't reach our target (I will just have one less kidney, Nina will put her name down for medical experiments and we will have to sleep on pillows filled with lint from our clothes dryer :-) but don't worry, your contribution WON’T  fall on fallow ground.We realize you may not be in a position to contribute financially in which case all we ask is that you spread the word & make heaps of noise about this project to people you think would be interested  and may be able to contribute. That is a huge contribution and we thank you for it!!There are indiegogo share tools on our campaign page.If you are new to our music, you can catch up by going to www.beautifullymad.comFor anyone without a paypal account you can contribute directly by bank transfer.

<h3>The Overview:</h3>
<p>I need your help to finish my next recording during the first half of 2017. It will be a 6 or 7 song EP titled ""Threaded""!  In this project the goal is to push the envelope a little further and to exceed that which was released on Causality back at the end of 2014. I couldn't be more excited about this next collection of material and I want to bring it to your ears at the highest quality possible as you deserve no less! I am forever grateful to those who have stood by me through the years, even in the most terrible times of self-doubt, and I carry that with me each and every day. To put it as bluntly as possible I don't want to give them crap, they really do deserve the best possible recording! </p>
<p>A sample from the upcoming release:</p>
<p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/jeremygilchrist/endless-war-studio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/jeremygilchrist/endless-war-studio</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal has been set at a lofty $3800 but in the recording world that is  pretty modest. To complete the EP as planned, I estimate a cost of $2500 or so to cover the remaining recording time needed with 2 songs already essentially completed at Hollow Body Studios (<a href=""http://www.hollowbodystudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hollowbodystudios.com/</a>), and to cover press/CD duplication costs. The remaining $1300 will be used to help record three pro shot and edited live songs as videos at Beehive productions (<a href=""http://www.beehivepro.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.beehivepro.com/</a>)</li>
<li>If the full goal to finish the record is not reached I will do all I can with what is given to first and foremost complete the EP, that is a must. If the amount exceeds $2500 but does not reach the full $3800 I will hold what is leftover and keep working to reach the amount required to record at Beehive. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project. as mentioned, will result in the best documentation of my music to date, and likely exceed prior efforts.</li>
<li>This project will be my best opportunity to reach wider audiences and to new ears via airplay on radio and online. </li>
<li>Most importantly, I feel this recording will be something longtime friends and fans will enjoy for years to come. There is no greater accomplishment for a creator than when someone connects with your art at the deepest possible level. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Challenges: </h3>
<p>With every project comes challenges that can lead to setbacks and delays, but failure only comes when you give up.  My promise to you is that I will never give up! I will be fully open with the progress being made and provide as many updates as I possibly can. It should be understood that expected dates of release are always tentative until I actually receive the final physical copies in hand.  If a concern arises feel free to contact me about it! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Finally: Spreading the Word is Vital:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I can post word of this campaign to social media until I am blue in the face, but this effort won't succeed without your help! Share it anywhere and everywhere! Indiegogo provides tools to share that make this very easy!  Even if you are unable to donate, a share can make a world of difference! </li>
<li>Please know that regardless of he outcome of this campaign, I am forever grateful and thankful to everyone who supports me! </li>

The songs should give comfort to people in difficult times (f.e. after a loss of a beloved person) and create a meditative mood. The Album is inspired by and dedicated to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. We need your support for the studio costs (studiotime, sound engineering, mastering and mixing of the songs) and the production of the CDs. Studio costs are about 7000 Euro and production of CD is about 1500 Euro.For only 2€ you receive 1 digital song, for 10€ we will send you 6 digital Tracks and If you donate 15€ you will receive a digital copy of the full Album before the CD is released.If you donate 20€ we send you the standard package of the CD per post at the beginning of december (before christmas).For 60€ you get 1 CD and a private singing or piano lesson. For 100€ you get a CD and a private music therapy session (western and indian music therapy). For 100€ you get a CD and a private session ""we show you how to compose your own song"". For 95€ you receive 5 CDs and for 200€ we send you 10 CDs per post before christmas.For 1000€ we will make a private concert for you (3 singers, keyboards,guitar and percussion) and you receive 10 Cds.If you can not support us financially, you can still help us by telling others about our campaign or sharing our link at the social medias.Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Bonjour,</h3>
<p>Je suis animateur et chroniqueur web. Étant donné que la majorité des grands médias délaissent les régions, j'ai eu l'idée de lancer une station radio internet afin d'aider au développement de ma région. En effet, très peu de couverture médiatique est offerte aux régions pour leurs activités ou leurs événements qui pourtant, sont fort intéressants. De plus, il est pratiquement impossible pour les petits commerçants indépendants de se faire connaître via ces médias dû au coup exorbitants de la production et de la diffusion de publicités.</p>
<p>J'adore ma région et je tient à ce qu'elle se développe et reste florissante, voilà pourquoi j'ai débuté ce projet. Votre contribution permettra de publiciser nos activités et nos événements , tout en permettant à nos petits commerçants de se faire connaître via nos ondes et notre site internet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>À quoi servira les fonds amassés?</p>
<p>Tout l'argent recueilli servira à assumer les frais de diffusion et de production pour une année complète. De cette façon, nous pourrons facturer des frais publicitaires très bas à ceux qui voudront ce faire connaître sur nos ondes. Même les plus petits commerçants auront la possibilité de s'offrir du temps d'antenne.  5000$ nous permet d'être en ondes pour au moins 6 mois.</p>
</div><div>
<p> Quel sera l'impact de vos dons?</p>
<p>Bien que ce soit à petite échelle, vos dons permettrons de contribuer à la création ou au maintien d'emplois, au développement touristique et à faire connaître des artistes qui autrement, ne seront peut-être jamais entendu, malgré leur grand talent.</p>

<h3>Le seul risque que vous courez, c'est de contribuer au développement de toute une communauté.</h3>

<p><strong>Our Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To introduce audiences to operatic gems - lesser known pieces of musical magic that deserve to be widely heard</li>
<li>To support a mix of  emerging and seasoned performers who form an collaborative artistic community</li>
<li>To share our work with the Boston area: performing in small, intimate venues, senior residences,  and schools; to spread the joy of music. We aim to lift the spirits of those in closed settings while exposing younger audiences to up-close and personal theater.</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Our History</strong></p>
<p>Executive Director Martha Birnbaum came up with the concept of an intimate, salon-like setting for lesser known operatic works. A meeting with soprano Caroline Spaeth, Artistic Administrator, at a Groupmuse Salon, led to a complete realization of this idea. Both knew that singers and audience loved the closeness and intimate connection with music and performers that a salon offers. And that atmosphere is what we will foster in The Cambridge Chamber Ensemble.</p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>Caroline and Martha are both highly accomplished musicians and artisans. Caroline has performed as a soloist with such organizations as Masterworks Chorale, Calliope Music, the Miami Music Festival, and Longwood Opera. A budding graphic artist, her work is on display in our website, <a href=""http://www.cambridgechamberensemble.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cambridgechamberensemble.org</a>, and in the design of all promotional material including posters, ads, and publicity. Martha has performed in Lowell Opera and Opera Aperta, and has been stage director for Mass Theatrica. She has hosted musical salons at her home in Cambridge for many years and has recently been hosting GroupMuse events which are often a showcase for emerging local artists. An expert linguist, she has provided the production with original translations of both works. She also directed the Boston premiere of ""A Game of Whist"" in 2012, check out our gallery to see photos of her vision!</p>
<p><strong>What We Do</strong></p>
<p>CCE gives new young talent  just starting their careers the opportunity to perform with more seasoned artists. Mixing these forces rewards the audience with an entertaining combination of novelty and experience. For example, we recently presented a “sing-along” of Mozart’s “The Magic Flute.” Fourteen singers, from recent graduates to professional talent, were brought into Martha’s living room to sing an entire operatic role in a semi-staged production. It was a great success, and we plan on hosting more. Check out photos from this event in our gallery.</p> <p><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our campaign target of $2000 will go toward our 1st production’s major expenses, the largest of which  is performance fees for 7 singers and two instrumentalists – a pianist and a violinist. Many  young companies do not pay their musicians, but we aim to provide our artists with a fully professional experience. These are among the most promising and finest performers in the Boston area, and they deserve the very best from our company. A smaller amount will be used to offset costume and prop expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways you can Help</strong></p>
<p>We would love your help, in both financial and non-financial ways. Pass along our Indiegogo campaign to your friends, and spread the word about our wonderful and exciting new opera company! No contribution is too small. If you cannot donate a dollar amount, tell your friends to buy  tickets (for only $15!) and come and enjoy two musically enchanting and hilarious operas.</p>

<p><strong>Hello! My name is HUMAN, the artist!</strong> </p>
<p>With my breath, thoughts, actions and songs I manifest into the world. I consider my life itself a precious art form and cherish this gift with gratitude and celebration. I feel lucky to have this body, mind and spirit. Like yours, my atoms were birthed in the stars. We share this common cosmic ancestor. The entire universe spins in symphony; together we play it's song. This<strong> HUMAN PROJECT</strong> reflects the ""notes"" that I carry as my contribution to this universal music. </p>

<p>Help me play this universal music by supporting the completion of my <strong>debut album and music video project.</strong> The heart of this runs deep. There's more to these pop songs than meets the eye (or the ear). Because this project marks for me the awakening of a potential deep within, I believe that just by listening to, aligning with and supporting the project you invite your deepest potentials to awaken too. It's a phenomena called 'quantum entanglement' or 'resonance' as I like to call it.</p>
<p><strong>This project is a manifestation of some of my highest dreams and potentials and it intends to inspire others to the same end. </strong>This endeavor goes <i>'far beyond'</i>  the music. You are helping to support my life project. I then get to support others' life projects. This is very much a 'pay it forward' scenario. I'll be giving back through song, dance, yoga, meditation, laughter, tears; all things that make me HUMAN. </p>

<p><strong>For a while now, the yoga classroom has been my stage.</strong></p>
<p>Teaching allows me to have a channel, a way to communicate transformative life views, practices and insights that tremendously better my life and the the lives of those around me. After a yoga class, the gratitude, the awareness and the love in the room is palpable. <strong>In the space of that class, a better world is made every time. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The HUMAN Project is simply an opportunity for a bigger platform, a bigger stage to continue on with delivering this healing and helpful energy.</strong> Imagine going to a music event where the artist leads mini yoga lessons, leaving you with words, thoughts and practices that may help to change your life for the better. Imagine then looking to your left, right, front and back and <strong>feeling more connected to yourself and the people around you.</strong> All the while I'd be serenading you with song, entertaining you with dance and showering you with all kinds of love and inspiration. By your contribution you get to help me create the space and the stage for this to happen.

<p>A few words about the next Kaos Skola Festival :) All of those who joined us last year, have an idea of what to expect already, but we are hoping to see many new faces.</p>
<p>A bit about us: We are a small family, we live in the beautiful South of Sweden and we simply thought that we should use the freedom and space for something amazing and one of a kind, to bring creative people together and simply enjoy a good time. Music had to play a big role, it should be family-friendly, rather hyppyish, and some good food (<b>100 % vegan</b>) was on the plan…and that's exactly what we did. Our Expectations were totally topped, the Kaos Skola Festival 2015 was absolutely brilliant, wonderful and we can't resist repeating it.</p>
<p>All that not just for fun but for a good cause? Impossibe  - nah…totally possible! <b>We donated all profits to 2 charitable causes </b>(an amazing 1200,-). And this will, of course, also be the case at the next festival. Maybe we can even top the amount? If you want to enter your organisation as a recipient of the profits, feel free to get in touch!</p>
<p>About the location: We have a yard of 5000 square meters, which offers a lot of space for many activities. It is quiet but not completely cut off. A 3 minute walk gets you to the lake for a nice swim.</p>
<p>At the last festival, we offered yoga and we had a ayurverdic masseuse with us. We promise to offer similar experiences for the next one!</p>
<p> Accommodation: Camping in our yard, on the neighbour's lawn, at the lake or in the forest. The choice is yours. We will also improve the sanitary facilities but please don't expect 5 stars ;)</p>
<p>Also: Dogs will be present, be prepared.</p>
<p>And: Kids until 12 yrs are free!</p>

die dieses Jahr dabei waren wissen ja schon in etwa was es zu erwarten 
gibt, wir hoffen aber auch auf viele neue Gesichter.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Erstmal zu uns: Wir sind eine kleine Familie, wohnen im schönen 
Südschweden und haben uns irgendwann gedacht, dass man das Stückchen 
Freiheit und Platz nutzen sollte um was Verrücktes zu tun, interessante 
kreative Menschen zusammen zu bringen und einfach eine gute Zeit zu 
verleben. <b>*** Musik ***</b> sollte eine grosse Rolle spielen, es sollte familienfreundlich sein, eher hippiemässig, noch dazu war gutes Essen geplant ( <b>100% vegan</b>
 )... tja, also haben wir das einfach mal gemacht, unsere Erwartungen 
wurden auch noch total übertroffen, das Kaos Skola Festival 2015 war 
absolut genial, wunderschön und wir können garnicht anders als es zu 
wiederholen.</p>
<p>Und dann noch was Gutes tun? Geht nicht- klar, geht! <b>Wir haben in diesem Jahr den kompletten Gewinn an 2 gemeinnützige Vereine gespendet</b>
 ( immerhin 1200,- ), das wird auch nächstes Jahr der Fall sein, und 
vielleicht wird es dann ja auch ein wenig mehr. Vereine dürfen sich auch
 gerne bei uns melden, für nächstes Jahr sind die Begünstigten noch 
nicht ausgewählt. </p>
<p>Zur Umgebung: Wir haben ein Grundstück von 5000qm2 was auf jeden Fall
 Platz für einige Aktivitäten lässt, es ist ruhig gelegen, aber nicht 
völlig abgeschieden, in 3 Minuten ist man beim See wo man wundervoll 
baden kann. </p>
<p>Dieses Jahr wurde auch Yoga angeboten, ausserdem hatten wir eine 
ayurvedische Masseurin mit heiligen Händen, auch für nächstes Jahr 
werden wir uns natürlich sowas einfallen lassen- versprochen!</p>
<p>Unterbringung: Entweder auf unserem Grundstück oder auf Nachbars 
Weide zelten ist möglich, man kann auch am See zelten oder im Wald, das 
steht jedem frei. Wir werden auch die sanitären Anlagen etwas 
verbessern, man darf aber dennoch keine 5 Sterne erwarten ;) </p>
<p>Sonst: es werden einige Hunde anwesend sein, da muss man mit zurecht kommen :)</p>
Und übrigens: Kinder bis 12 Jahre feiern umsonst mit!<br/>

<p align=""center""><b>Création de la LIREPOC – Ligue de Résistance Politique et
Citoyenne
</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Depuis la seconde guerre mondiale, les européens sont colonisés par les Etats-unis
et forcés de pratiquer une politique sioniste favorable à Israël. Partout aux 4 coins du
monde, nos pays répandent le mal et font couler le sang des innocents en s'alliant
avec des pays immoraux pour lesquels l'homme n'a aucune valeur.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">En Europe, la démocratie est une notion de plus en plus vague. Les dirigeants
européens ne se gênent nullement pour donner des leçons de démocratie à
l’étranger alors qu’ils sont incapables de la respecter et de la mettre en œuvre dans
leurs propres pays. Le fossé entre les citoyens et leurs représentants politique ne
cesse de s’accroître. Les citoyens attendent un changement mais le pouvoir en place
empêche toute évolution.
</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>A cause des politiques criminelles de nos dirigeants, les attentats se
multiplient partout dans le monde. La peur se propage et la haine grandit. Si
nous ne réagissons pas, demain, ce sera le chaos !
</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Si nous ne parvenons pas à changer en profondeur l’Europe et sa politique, si nous
ne détournons pas les pays européens de l’axe du mal, l’axe américano-sioniste, si
nous ne dénonçons pas les alliances de nos dirigeants avec des pays voyous
comme le Qatar et l’Arabie saoudite, le chaos continuera à se propager un peu
partout dans le monde mais surtout en Afrique, au Maghreb et au Moyen-Orient.
</p>
<p><b>Les manipulations médiatiques et politiques que nous connaissons actuellement font
de nous des esclaves des temps modernes</b>.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Il est temps que le monde comprenne ce qui est en train de se jouer en ce moment.
Avec les attentats qui frappent l’Europe, la Russie et le Moyen-Orient, c'est la
stratégie du chaos qui est mise en oeuvre !
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Les attentats qui frappent l’Europe et différents pays qui ont connu ces
dernières années une vague de recolonisation poursuivent un objectif simple :
la création du Grand Israël et l’établissement d’un nouvel ordre mondial !
</p>
<p>Il faut créer la peur de l'autre au sein-même de l'Europe. <b>Diviser pour mieux régner !</b>
</p>
<p>Ainsi, les attentats de Paris de 2015 (comme d'autres avant eux) sont des attentats
qui poursuivent des objectifs purement politiques. Tout comme on veut nous
présenter des chefs d’Etat étrangers comme des dictateurs ou des bouchers, nos
politiques, aidés par les médias, qui ne sont plus que des organes de propagande,
veulent nous faire croire que ce sont des musulmans radicaux qui ont perpétré ces
attentats alors que ces gens sont en fait instrumentalisés, formés et manipulés par
les services secrets européens, américains et israéliens. Le but est de créer en
Europe un sentiment d'insécurité en pointant du doigt les musulmans comme les
responsables de cette insécurité qui ne cesse de s'étendre.
</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>
</p><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">N’oublions pas que nos pays européens ont aidé, armé, équipé et financé DAESH en
Syrie directement et indirectement. N’oublions pas non plus que Ben Laden et Al
Quaïda ont bénéficié largement du soutien des USA et de la CIA.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Avec ces attentats qui frappent l’Europe, tous les musulmans deviennent, pour
l'opinion publique manipulée par les médias, des terroristes potentiels. Tout est mis
en oeuvre pour vous démontrer que même votre jeune et gentille voisine de pallier
peut se transformer en kamikaze si elle est musulmane ! C'est édifiant ! C'est
extrêmement dangereux surtout que des attaques du même type au Mali ont, elles,
pour but de stigmatiser la population européenne d’origine africaine ! Désormais,
dans les transports en commun en Europe, les personnes typées africaines ou
arabes ne sont plus regardées de la même manière. La peur de l’autre se propage !
</p>
<p>La haine du monde arabe ne cesse d'augmenter dans nos pays et tout cela
poursuit 2 objectifs concrets:
</p>
<p><b>1)</b> <b>diviser la population de nos pays pour créer le chaos en Europe.</b> Imaginez
les dégâts qu'une telle démarche pourrait entraîner quand on sait que 10% de la
population belge est musulmane et qu'en France cette proportion monte à 20% de la
population. C'est donc la guerre civile que ceux qui montent ces attentats et les
déguisent en attentats islamistes poursuivent et veulent créer.
</p>
<p><b>2) donner des Musulmans une mauvaise image en Europe, c'est bon pour
Israël qui pourra continuer à massacrer les Palestiniens mais aussi ceux qui
oseront encore se mettre sur leur chemin</b>. Plus l'islamophobie progresse en
Europe et plus les frontières d'Israël s'étendent ! Après avoir déjà créé de fausses
révolutions dans certains pays du Maghreb et renversé la plus grande majorité des
Chefs d’Etat hostiles au sionisme, le projet de création du Grand Israël n’a jamais été
aussi près de se réaliser. Aujourd’hui, seuls la Syrie, l’Iran et la Russie s’y opposent encore...
</p>
<p><b>Il est donc primordial de s’organiser au sein-même de l’Europe mais aussi avec nos
alliés antisionistes dans le monde pour créer un front politique et citoyen de
résistance.
</b></p>
<p>Il est temps que les peuples d'Europe et du monde comprennent cette triste réalité
sinon, en moins de temps qu'il ne faut pour le dire, nos pays seront plongés dans la
guerre civile et le chaos. Le chaos est en effet la seule et unique manière de revoir le
monde et son fonctionnement. <b>Après chaque guerre mondiale, un nouvel ordre
s'établit. Le prochain, ce sera le Nouvel Ordre Mondial avec un gouvernement
mondial et sa capitale à Jérusalem, tout cela bien sûr au nom de la paix et de la lutte
contre le terrorisme. </b>A terme, tout le pouvoir sera entre les mains d'un groupe
minuscule et ceux qui ne s'y soumettront pas seront considérés comme des
terroristes qu'il faut éliminer ! Voilà le projet en cours, voilà comment ceux qui dirigent
veulent nous soumettre à l'esclavage moderne !
</p>
<p>Face à cette réalité, il est urgent de créer un front de la résistance regroupant
ceux qui, à travers le monde, refusent de s’allier avec l’axe du mal et
souhaitent s’opposer à l’impérialisme américain et au sionisme.
</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Conscient qu’en Europe la voie politique est actuellement bouchée à cause du
trucage des élections et parce que nous savons qu'aucun changement ne
viendra par le monde politique dont les personnalités ne sont mises en avant
que si elles ont vendu leur âme au diable, il est important de choisir une voie
plus souterraine qui puisse travailler sur le long terme sans se soucier des
échéances électorales.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ce n’est donc pas un mouvement politique qu’il faut créer mais un lobby, un
groupe de pression. Les lobbys ne s'affichent pas ouvertement, ils travaillent
en sous-marin et c'est exactement ce que nous devons faire en unissant
toutes les personnalités et mouvements antisionistes dans le monde. Ce n'est
qu'ainsi que nous pourrons influer sur la société et sur les décisions de nos
élus.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Actif pendant 4 ans au Parlement belge en tant
 que député, Laurent LOUIS
s’est rendu compte que le lobby sioniste était plus que puissant et 
imposait
ses vues et ses ordres à tous les politiciens d'Europe. En outre, à 
côté de ce
lobby puissant, d'autres lobbys règnent en maîtres absolus en Europe. 
Le
lobby de l'armement mais aussi les lobbys pharmaceutiques et 
agro-alimentaires. Nos élus sont totalement soumis à ces lobbys qui 
mènent la
danse au Parlement européen et dans nos parlements nationaux.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pour plaire à ces lobbys, tout est permis ! On crée des guerres aux 4 coins du
monde pour vendre des armes, on encourage les OGM dans notre
alimentation, on nous fait ingurgiter des produits néfastes et on nous gave de
médicaments pour mieux nous empoisonner.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">N'oublions pas le projet morbide de Bill Gates qui veut réduire drastiquement
la population mondiale ! Pour ce faire, il faut des guerres, des attentats mais il
faut aussi empoisonner les citoyens et les méthodes sont nombreuses
(médicaments, chemtrails, OGM, vaccins, drogues, etc...)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Face à cette réalité, nous devons réagir mais ceux qui le font seuls sont
malheureusement broyés ou ridiculisés par le pouvoir en place qui
défend ses intérêts et ceux des multinationales auxquelles il est soumis. Il est
donc important d'offrir un contrepoids à ces puissants lobbys afin de
contrecarrer leurs plans diaboliques. Lutter contre ces machines
puissantes et bien organisées ne peut se faire la fleur au fusil, il nous
faut une organisation solide qui protège ses membres et ses acteurs,
une association qui travaille à temps plein et qui puisse disposer de
moyens pour lutter contre les propagandes politiques et médiatiques.
</p>
<p align=""center""><b>Il faut construire un front mondial de la résistance afin de
libérer le monde des maux qui sont en train de le détruire et
de mettre un terme aux massacres perpétrés aujourd’hui au
nom d’une démocratie qui présente toutes les apparences de
la dictature.
</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Adversaire du sionisme et des lobbys pharmaceutiques et agro-alimentaires
depuis des années au sein du Parlement belge, Laurent LOUIS a pu constater
à quel point nous étions démunis pour lutter contre ces forces qui nous
oppriment.
Seuls, sans mouvement pour nous protéger, nous sommes des cibles faciles.

					</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ensemble, en usant des mêmes pratiques que ces lobbys criminels, en
travaillant à temps plein pour dénoncer leurs dérives via des actions
concrètes sur le terrain, des spots publicitaires, des conférences et une
propagande efficace, nous serons en mesure de mieux informer les
citoyens et de leur ouvrir les yeux. Ce n'est que de cette manière, par la
propagande, par l'organisation, par l'information et la lutte que nous créerons
un monde meilleur et plus sain pour nos enfants !
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p align=""center""><b>Face à la situation mondiale qui ne cesse de se détériorer, il 
est
important aujourd'hui de créer un véritable lobby anti-sioniste, 
anti-capitaliste, anti-mondialiste prônant SANS VIOLENCE la 
réconciliation
entre tous les citoyens peu importent leur langue, leurs origines ou 
leur
religion en plein cœur de Bruxelles, capitale de l’Union européenne.
</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Si le siège central se doit d’être en Europe, l’idéal serait de constituer des
cellules nationales dans différents pays, des cellules qui permettraient de
diffuser les actions de chaque cellule au niveau mondial (traduction de texte,
sous-titrage de vidéos, diffusion des actions, coordination, etc).
</p>
<p>Agir uniquement en Europe n’a pas de sens, il faut aussi pouvoir agir aux
Etats-Unis, en Amérique du Sud, en Russie, en Afrique, au Maghreb et au
Moyen-Orient.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Le présent lobby que nous vous proposons de créer sera également le porte-
parole des valeurs morales que nos sociétés actuelles ont reniées à cause de
la « démoralisation » de la société mise en œuvre par la franc-maçonnerie
(IVG, mariage homosexuel, banalisation des drogues douces et dures, théorie
du genre à l’école, etc...).
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Une des missions prioritaires de ce lobby sera de lutter contre l’islamophobie
véhiculée par nos médias tout en dénonçant les manipulations médiatiques et
politiques. Dans une Europe manipulée et victime du terrorisme d'Etat
instrumentalisant le terrorisme prétendument islamiste pour salir les
Musulmans et favoriser la création du Grand Israël, il est primordial et urgent
de donner une image positive de l'Islam et des Musulmans en jetant des ponts
entre les différentes communautés de nos pays.

<p align=""center""><b>Ce dont nous avons besoin
</b></p>
<p>Afin de créer ce lobby anti-sioniste et anti-impérialiste nous avons essentiellement
besoin, dans un premier temps, de moyens financiers afin de créer des bureaux et
un studio d'enregistrement en plein coeur de Bruxelles, la capitale européenne. Par
la suite, d’autres bureaux seront ouverts aux 4 coins du monde.
</p>
<p>Avec ces bureaux et ces outils audio-visuels, nous pourrons alors mener des actions
concrètes sur le terrain mais aussi sur le net. Notre résistance doit se
professionnaliser pour se faire respecter par nos ennemis et se faire mieux
entendre par nos concitoyens.
</p>
<p>L'idéal serait de pouvoir disposer d'un local qui puisse se transformer en salle de
conférence. Il n'est en effet pas normal que certaines personnes soient censurées en
Europe et ne puissent jamais trouver une salle pour s’exprimer comme c’est le cas
pour Laurent LOUIS qui a pu, ces 5 dernières années, donner des conférences à
travers le monde mais qui est interdit de toute conférence en Belgique ! Il en est de
même pour d'autres personnalités qui sont trop souvent considérées comme persona
non grata.
</p>
<p>Avec un lieu à nous, capable d'accueillir des spectateurs, nous pourrions donner la
parole à ceux que le pouvoir souhaite réduire au silence. Ce lieu pourrait également
être utilisé pour développer une activité commerciale qui puisse permettre à un
investisseur étranger d’investir dans notre lobby via une activité commerciale
annexe.
</p>
<p>Trop de citoyens se battent depuis des années sans le moindre soutien. Ces
citoyens engagés sont malheureusement trop souvent broyés par le système et
connaissent bien souvent des difficultés financières. Notre lobby sera là pour leur
venir en aide et leur permettre de continuer leur travail au sein d’une structure plus
sécurisante capable de protéger leurs intérêts et de les défendre face aux
agissements de l’Etat.
</p>
<p>Notre lobby aidera aussi tous les journalistes indépendants et les structures
d'information alternative qui existent sur le web mais qui ne disposent en général que
de très peu de moyens financiers. Ces gens qui tentent d'informer les citoyens avec
des bouts de ficelles méritent notre soutien !
</p>
<p>Grâce à notre lobby, nous ferons le nécessaire pour obtenir le soutien des pays non-
alignés qui osent encore s'opposer aux USA et à l'impérialisme sioniste afin de
pouvoir peser de plus en plus sur nos dirigeants mais aussi sur nos médias. Pour
réaliser cet axe du bien, il sera important d'organiser des voyages à l'étranger,
au Moyen-Orient, en Russie ou en Amérique du Sud afin d'y rencontrer des
responsables et des personnalités politiques pour élaborer avec elles une
politique et des actions communes.

médiatiques et politiques et les dérives de l'Etat d'Israël.
</p>
<p>Ainsi, en donnant la parole aux victimes du sionisme dans le monde, nous
informerons les citoyens des crimes du sionisme et nous inciterons les
Européens à réclamer la libération de toutes les terres occupées ! Nous
n’entendons jamais un Palestinien ou un responsable du Hezbollah dans nos

<b>
</b><p>Elu au Parlement fédéral belge en juin 2010, Laurent LOUIS a fait trembler la
politique belge durant son mandat. Grâce à ses interventions dérangeantes et à
contre courant de la politique gouvernementale belge et européenne, Laurent LOUIS
est parvenu à rassembler derrière lui une frange importante de la population belge
tout en bénéficiant d’un capital sympathie en France mais aussi dans différents pays
du monde, en Afrique et au Moyen-Orient. 
</p>
<p>Jamais jusqu’ici un député belge n’était
parvenu à faire autant parler de lui à l’étranger, signe que le poids des mots et des
images est considérable dans le monde actuel.

					
<b>
</b></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p>Pour concrétiser ce soutien, le mouvement Debout Les Belges fut créé en novembre
2013 en vue des élections fédérales, régionales et européennes de mai 2014.
Debout Les Belges proposait un programme politique novateur s’opposant aux
lobbys pharmaceutiques, à la mondialisation, à l’impérialisme, au néo-colonialisme,
au sionisme, à la franc-maçonnerie et proposant aux citoyens belges une révolution
démocratique basée sur la suppression des partis politiques et la création d’un
Parlement citoyen libéré des lobbys.
</p>
<b><b><b>
</b></b></b><p>En quelques semaines, se basant sur un travail parlementaire atypique le
mouvement Debout Les Belges connut un succès dépassant toutes les attentes en
atteignant les 10 000 membres, un chiffre faisant de Debout Les Belges la 4ème force
politique en Belgique francophone. Le mouvement était pourtant censuré par les
médias qui l’ignoraient totalement. Pas une interview que ce soit à la télévision, à la
radio ou même dans la presse écrite. Le mouvement dérangeait et il ne fallait surtout
pas en parler...
</p>
<p>Malgré cela, Debout Les Belges réalisa de très bons résultats aux élections de mai
2014 récoltant près de 100 000 voix en Belgique francophone. Des élections qui
furent marquées par un nombre particulièrement élevé de dysfonctionnements. Des
ordinateurs en panne, des bulletins perdus, des urnes ouvertes, des résultats
manipulés, des bulletins de vote au nom du mouvement retrouvés dans des
poubelles et un nombre particulièrement important de bulletins nuls...
</p>
<p>La meilleure performance du mouvement eut lieu dans le Hainaut où Laurent LOUIS
était candidat tête de liste au fédéral. Sa liste fit près de 25 000 voix à elle toute
seule.
</p>
<p>A titre personnel, avec un budget électoral de 3000 euros (!!!), Laurent LOUIS fit un
score exceptionnel. Avec plus de 13 000 voix de préférence, Laurent LOUIS a
obtenu le 7ème meilleur score de la province.
</p>
<p>Malheureusement, malgré ce score, Laurent LOUIS ne fut pas élu. Il y avait pourtant
18 sièges à pourvoir en Hainaut mais malgré qu’il ait obtenu le 7ème meilleur score, la
loi électorale belge ne lui permit pas de conserver son siège au Parlement.
</p>
<p>Une aberration du système belge prétendument démocratique.

<div>
<div>
<p>Obtenir un tel score sans avoir la parole dans les médias est totalement
exceptionnel. Cela démontre que Debout Les Belges et sa figure de proue sont
parvenus à toucher les citoyens et à se faire connaître malgré la censure médiatique
et l’oppression de l’Etat grâce avant tout à internet et aux réseaux sociaux.
</p>
<p>Situation totalement surréaliste dans un pays qui se veut démocratique, le
mouvement Debout Les Belges n’a jamais pu ouvrir un compte en banque auprès
d’une banque belge, rendant de la sorte impossible toute contribution financière de
ses 10 000 membres, des ressources qui lui auraient pourtant permis de mener une
campagne électorale bien plus efficace.
</p>
<p>Pour contrer un mouvement qu’il considérait comme dangereux, l’Etat avait décidé
de le priver de tout moyen financier.
</p>
<p>Malgré ces difficultés, Debout Les Belges est parvenu à rassembler de très
nombreux jeunes, souvent issus de l’immigration, de différentes confessions
religieuses mais aussi de très nombreux Belges de souche exclus du système,
défavorisés qui ne connaissaient rien à la politique et qui sont devenus des activistes
de notre cause.
</p>
<p>Malheureusement privés de moyens financiers, Debout Les Belges a du depuis
quelques mois suspendre ses activités. Trop de nos membres subissaient des
sanctions de natures diverses de la part des autorités en rapport avec leur
engagement envers notre mouvement (licenciements, perte d’un logement social,
pressions politiques et policières, etc...). Pour protéger ses membres, il a été décidé
de mettre le mouvement en veille.
<br/><br/>Pour pouvoir poursuivre son combat et développer un vrai 
mouvement solide, Laurent LOUIS fait désormais appel à votre aide et à 
votre soutien financier. Avec lui, construisez le monde de demain !

Citoyenne

Depuis la seconde guerre mondiale, les européens sont colonisés par les Etats-unis
et forcés de pratiquer une politique sioniste favorable à Israël. Partout aux 4 coins du
monde, nos pays répandent le mal et font couler le sang des innocents en s'alliant
avec des pays immoraux pour lesquels l'homme n'a aucune valeur.

En Europe, la démocratie est une notion de plus en plus vague. Les dirigeants
européens ne se gênent nullement pour donner des leçons de démocratie à
l’étranger alors qu’ils sont incapables de la respecter et de la mettre en œuvre dans
leurs propres pays. Le fossé entre les citoyens et leurs représentants politique ne
cesse de s’accroître. Les citoyens attendent un changement mais le pouvoir en place
empêche toute évolution.

A cause des politiques criminelles de nos dirigeants, les attentats se
multiplient partout dans le monde. La peur se propage et la haine grandit. Si
nous ne réagissons pas, demain, ce sera le chaos !

Si nous ne parvenons pas à changer en profondeur l’Europe et sa politique, si nous
ne détournons pas les pays européens de l’axe du mal, l’axe américano-sioniste, si
nous ne dénonçons pas les alliances de nos dirigeants avec des pays voyous
comme le Qatar et l’Arabie saoudite, le chaos continuera à se propager un peu
partout dans le monde mais surtout en Afrique, au Maghreb et au Moyen-Orient.

Les manipulations médiatiques et politiques que nous connaissons actuellement font
de nous des esclaves des temps modernes.

Il est temps que le monde comprenne ce qui est en train de se jouer en ce moment.
Avec les attentats qui frappent l’Europe, la Russie et le Moyen-Orient, c'est la
stratégie du chaos qui est mise en oeuvre !

Les attentats qui frappent l’Europe et différents pays qui ont connu ces
dernières années une vague de recolonisation poursuivent un objectif simple :
la création du Grand Israël et l’établissement d’un nouvel ordre mondial !

Il faut créer la peur de l'autre au sein-même de l'Europe. Diviser pour mieux régner !

Ainsi, les attentats de Paris de 2015 (comme d'autres avant eux) sont des attentats
qui poursuivent des objectifs purement politiques. Tout comme on veut nous
présenter des chefs d’Etat étrangers comme des dictateurs ou des bouchers, nos
politiques, aidés par les médias, qui ne sont plus que des organes de propagande,
veulent nous faire croire que ce sont des musulmans radicaux qui ont perpétré ces
attentats alors que ces gens sont en fait instrumentalisés, formés et manipulés par
les services secrets européens, américains et israéliens. Le but est de créer en
Europe un sentiment d'insécurité en pointant du doigt les musulmans comme les
responsables de cette insécurité qui ne cesse de s'étendre.





N’oublions pas que nos pays européens ont aidé, armé, équipé et financé DAESH en
Syrie directement et indirectement. N’oublions pas non plus que Ben Laden et Al
Quaïda ont bénéficié largement du soutien des USA et de la CIA.

Avec ces attentats qui frappent l’Europe, tous les musulmans deviennent, pour
l'opinion publique manipulée par les médias, des terroristes potentiels. Tout est mis
en oeuvre pour vous démontrer que même votre jeune et gentille voisine de pallier
peut se transformer en kamikaze si elle est musulmane ! C'est édifiant ! C'est
extrêmement dangereux surtout que des attaques du même type au Mali ont, elles,
pour but de stigmatiser la population européenne d’origine africaine ! Désormais,
dans les transports en commun en Europe, les personnes typées africaines ou
arabes ne sont plus regardées de la même manière. La peur de l’autre se propage !

La haine du monde arabe ne cesse d'augmenter dans nos pays et tout cela
poursuit 2 objectifs concrets:

1) diviser la population de nos pays pour créer le chaos en Europe. Imaginez
les dégâts qu'une telle démarche pourrait entraîner quand on sait que 10% de la
population belge est musulmane et qu'en France cette proportion monte à 20% de la
population. C'est donc la guerre civile que ceux qui montent ces attentats et les
déguisent en attentats islamistes poursuivent et veulent créer.

2) donner des Musulmans une mauvaise image en Europe, c'est bon pour
Israël qui pourra continuer à massacrer les Palestiniens mais aussi ceux qui
oseront encore se mettre sur leur chemin. Plus l'islamophobie progresse en
Europe et plus les frontières d'Israël s'étendent ! Après avoir déjà créé de fausses
révolutions dans certains pays du Maghreb et renversé la plus grande majorité des
Chefs d’Etat hostiles au sionisme, le projet de création du Grand Israël n’a jamais été
aussi près de se réaliser. Aujourd’hui, seuls la Syrie, l’Iran et la Russie s’y opposent encore...

Il est donc primordial de s’organiser au sein-même de l’Europe mais aussi avec nos
alliés antisionistes dans le monde pour créer un front politique et citoyen de
résistance.

Il est temps que les peuples d'Europe et du monde comprennent cette triste réalité
sinon, en moins de temps qu'il ne faut pour le dire, nos pays seront plongés dans la
guerre civile et le chaos. Le chaos est en effet la seule et unique manière de revoir le
monde et son fonctionnement. Après chaque guerre mondiale, un nouvel ordre
s'établit. Le prochain, ce sera le Nouvel Ordre Mondial avec un gouvernement
mondial et sa capitale à Jérusalem, tout cela bien sûr au nom de la paix et de la lutte
contre le terrorisme. A terme, tout le pouvoir sera entre les mains d'un groupe
minuscule et ceux qui ne s'y soumettront pas seront considérés comme des
terroristes qu'il faut éliminer ! Voilà le projet en cours, voilà comment ceux qui dirigent
veulent nous soumettre à l'esclavage moderne !

Face à cette réalité, il est urgent de créer un front de la résistance regroupant
ceux qui, à travers le monde, refusent de s’allier avec l’axe du mal et
souhaitent s’opposer à l’impérialisme américain et au sionisme.







Conscient qu’en Europe la voie politique est actuellement bouchée à cause du
trucage des élections et parce que nous savons qu'aucun changement ne
viendra par le monde politique dont les personnalités ne sont mises en avant
que si elles ont vendu leur âme au diable, il est important de choisir une voie
plus souterraine qui puisse travailler sur le long terme sans se soucier des
échéances électorales.

Ce n’est donc pas un mouvement politique qu’il faut créer mais un lobby, un
groupe de pression. Les lobbys ne s'affichent pas ouvertement, ils travaillent
en sous-marin et c'est exactement ce que nous devons faire en unissant
toutes les personnalités et mouvements antisionistes dans le monde. Ce n'est
qu'ainsi que nous pourrons influer sur la société et sur les décisions de nos
élus.



Actif pendant 4 ans au Parlement belge en tant
 que député, Laurent LOUIS
s’est rendu compte que le lobby sioniste était plus que puissant et 
imposait
ses vues et ses ordres à tous les politiciens d'Europe. En outre, à 
côté de ce
lobby puissant, d'autres lobbys règnent en maîtres absolus en Europe. 
Le
lobby de l'armement mais aussi les lobbys pharmaceutiques et 
agro-alimentaires. Nos élus sont totalement soumis à ces lobbys qui 
mènent la
danse au Parlement européen et dans nos parlements nationaux.

Pour plaire à ces lobbys, tout est permis ! On crée des guerres aux 4 coins du
monde pour vendre des armes, on encourage les OGM dans notre
alimentation, on nous fait ingurgiter des produits néfastes et on nous gave de
médicaments pour mieux nous empoisonner.

N'oublions pas le projet morbide de Bill Gates qui veut réduire drastiquement
la population mondiale ! Pour ce faire, il faut des guerres, des attentats mais il
faut aussi empoisonner les citoyens et les méthodes sont nombreuses
(médicaments, chemtrails, OGM, vaccins, drogues, etc...)



Face à cette réalité, nous devons réagir mais ceux qui le font seuls sont
malheureusement broyés ou ridiculisés par le pouvoir en place qui
défend ses intérêts et ceux des multinationales auxquelles il est soumis. Il est
donc important d'offrir un contrepoids à ces puissants lobbys afin de
contrecarrer leurs plans diaboliques. Lutter contre ces machines
puissantes et bien organisées ne peut se faire la fleur au fusil, il nous
faut une organisation solide qui protège ses membres et ses acteurs,
une association qui travaille à temps plein et qui puisse disposer de
moyens pour lutter contre les propagandes politiques et médiatiques.

Il faut construire un front mondial de la résistance afin de
libérer le monde des maux qui sont en train de le détruire et
de mettre un terme aux massacres perpétrés aujourd’hui au
nom d’une démocratie qui présente toutes les apparences de
la dictature.



Adversaire du sionisme et des lobbys pharmaceutiques et agro-alimentaires
depuis des années au sein du Parlement belge, Laurent LOUIS a pu constater
à quel point nous étions démunis pour lutter contre ces forces qui nous
oppriment.
Seuls, sans mouvement pour nous protéger, nous sommes des cibles faciles.

					
Ensemble, en usant des mêmes pratiques que ces lobbys criminels, en
travaillant à temps plein pour dénoncer leurs dérives via des actions
concrètes sur le terrain, des spots publicitaires, des conférences et une
propagande efficace, nous serons en mesure de mieux informer les
citoyens et de leur ouvrir les yeux. Ce n'est que de cette manière, par la
propagande, par l'organisation, par l'information et la lutte que nous créerons
un monde meilleur et plus sain pour nos enfants !






Face à la situation mondiale qui ne cesse de se détériorer, il 
est
important aujourd'hui de créer un véritable lobby anti-sioniste, 
anti-capitaliste, anti-mondialiste prônant SANS VIOLENCE la 
réconciliation
entre tous les citoyens peu importent leur langue, leurs origines ou 
leur
religion en plein cœur de Bruxelles, capitale de l’Union européenne.

Si le siège central se doit d’être en Europe, l’idéal serait de constituer des
cellules nationales dans différents pays, des cellules qui permettraient de
diffuser les actions de chaque cellule au niveau mondial (traduction de texte,
sous-titrage de vidéos, diffusion des actions, coordination, etc).

Agir uniquement en Europe n’a pas de sens, il faut aussi pouvoir agir aux
Etats-Unis, en Amérique du Sud, en Russie, en Afrique, au Maghreb et au
Moyen-Orient.

Le présent lobby que nous vous proposons de créer sera également le porte-
parole des valeurs morales que nos sociétés actuelles ont reniées à cause de
la « démoralisation » de la société mise en œuvre par la franc-maçonnerie
(IVG, mariage homosexuel, banalisation des drogues douces et dures, théorie
du genre à l’école, etc...).

Une des missions prioritaires de ce lobby sera de lutter contre l’islamophobie
véhiculée par nos médias tout en dénonçant les manipulations médiatiques et
politiques. Dans une Europe manipulée et victime du terrorisme d'Etat
instrumentalisant le terrorisme prétendument islamiste pour salir les
Musulmans et favoriser la création du Grand Israël, il est primordial et urgent
de donner une image positive de l'Islam et des Musulmans en jetant des ponts
entre les différentes communautés de nos pays.

Face à l'axe du mal, nous devons créer et organiser l'axe du bien ! La
LIREPOC, la Ligue de Résistance Politique et Citoyenne se propose de mener
ce combat ! 







Les Missions de la LIREPOC




Installée à titre principal à Bruxelles, en plein cœur de l’Europe mais disposant aussi
dans l’idéal d’un siège au Moyen-Orient (Beyrouth - LIBAN), en Russie (Moscou),
aux Etats-Unis, en Tunisie (Tunis), en République démocratique du Congo
(Kinshasa), en Chine (Péking) et en Amérique du sud (Vénézuela ou Bolivie), la
LIREPOC a vocation à exercer les missions suivantes :

- Réaliser des critiques et analyses du monde politique européen et mondial.

- Informer la population sur la mondialisation, le sionisme, la finance mondiale,
Bilderberg, Monsanto, le néo-colonialisme, les dérives totalitaires de l’Union
européenne actuelle, les crimes perpétrés par Israël, etc...

- Assurer un contrepoids puissant et efficace aux manipulations médiatiques et
politiques qui pratiquent l’inversion totale des valeurs et de la réalité.

- Exercer un lobbying auprès des politiciens européens, arabes et africains afin de
rassembler tous les parlementaires et élus partageant nos combats dans les
différents pays du monde.

- Exercer un lobbying au sein du Parlement européen – regroupement des députés
européens partageant nos idées et valeurs. Tous les députés européens seront
contactés pour les sensibiliser à nos combats (courriers personnalisés, demande de
RDV, envoi d’une newsletter par mail, invitation à des évènements/conférences)

- Rechercher le soutien de personnalités du monde sportif, musical ou artistique afin
de leur proposer de devenir les parrains de notre organisation. Parvenir à rassembler
derrière une structure solide et saine, des personnalités publiques nous aidera à
conscientiser la population aux combats que nous menons. L’idéal serait de trouver
des parrains sur les différents continents, des parrains et marraines qui disposent
d’une bonne image et qui pourraient être les ambassadeurs médiatiques de notre
structure.

- Conscientiser la population par divers moyens : politique, conférence, humour,
spots publicitaires, vidéos d’information ludiques, réseaux sociaux, musique, art,
actions sur le terrain. Grâce à notre réseau, toute vidéo réalisée serait directement
traduite en anglais, en russe, en arabe, en espagnol et pourquoi pas en chinois pour
être diffusée au niveau mondial. Le constat est très clair : la parole n’est jamais
donnée, dans les médias occidentaux, aux victimes de la colonisation et du
sionisme. Autant on donne souvent la parole aux Israéliens dans nos médias, autant
on n’entend jamais le témoignage d’un Palestinien ou d’un Africain. Et quand des
vidéos de ce type sont diffusées sur le net, l’obstacle de la langue se présente
devant nous. En traduisant ces vidéos et en les diffusant à l’échelle mondiale, nous
donnerons enfin de l’écho aux souffrances des victimes de l’impérialisme américain
et sioniste ! Il est temps de libérer la parole anti-sioniste et de la diffuser partout dans
le monde !






- Mener des actions en vue de jeter des ponts entre les musulmans et les non-
musulmans afin de créer un véritable bien-vivre ensemble et lutter contre
l’islamophobie actuelle.

- Défendre la foi et la liberté de culte dans le monde mais aussi au sein d’une Europe
dévastée par le projet franc-maçon de « démoralisation » de la société.

- Lutter contre les discriminations.

- Défendre la famille et le rétablissement des valeurs morales.

-Lutter contre les dérives morales (mariage homosexuel, LGBT, gay pride,
avortement, euthanasie des mineurs, théorie du genre, libération totale des mœurs,
dépravation, drogues, etc...)

- Développer un axe anti-américain, anti-impérialiste et anti-colonial.

Vu le contexte, le moment est particulièrement propice pour développer un tel projet.
Les Européens ne font plus confiance aux politiciens. Un peu partout, de plus en plus
de citoyens rejettent le système et ses dérives. Les gens n’ont plus d’espoir. Il est
temps de leur rendre cet espoir ! La LIREPOC peut sans aucun doute y contribuer !

Les Européens rejettent en outre de plus en plus le sionisme, les banques, la
mondialisation, les dérives éthiques et morales ainsi que les guerres néo-coloniales.
Nous assistons actuellement à un rejet total des élites politiques, médiatiques et
intellectuelles. Un renouveau ne demande qu’à éclore et il est de notre devoir de
participer à ce renouveau européen !






Ce dont nous avons besoin

Afin de créer ce lobby anti-sioniste et anti-impérialiste nous avons essentiellement
besoin, dans un premier temps, de moyens financiers afin de créer des bureaux et
un studio d'enregistrement en plein coeur de Bruxelles, la capitale européenne. Par
la suite, d’autres bureaux seront ouverts aux 4 coins du monde.

Avec ces bureaux et ces outils audio-visuels, nous pourrons alors mener des actions
concrètes sur le terrain mais aussi sur le net. Notre résistance doit se
professionnaliser pour se faire respecter par nos ennemis et se faire mieux
entendre par nos concitoyens.

L'idéal serait de pouvoir disposer d'un local qui puisse se transformer en salle de
conférence. Il n'est en effet pas normal que certaines personnes soient censurées en
Europe et ne puissent jamais trouver une salle pour s’exprimer comme c’est le cas
pour Laurent LOUIS qui a pu, ces 5 dernières années, donner des conférences à
travers le monde mais qui est interdit de toute conférence en Belgique ! Il en est de
même pour d'autres personnalités qui sont trop souvent considérées comme persona
non grata.

Avec un lieu à nous, capable d'accueillir des spectateurs, nous pourrions donner la
parole à ceux que le pouvoir souhaite réduire au silence. Ce lieu pourrait également
être utilisé pour développer une activité commerciale qui puisse permettre à un
investisseur étranger d’investir dans notre lobby via une activité commerciale
annexe.

Trop de citoyens se battent depuis des années sans le moindre soutien. Ces
citoyens engagés sont malheureusement trop souvent broyés par le système et
connaissent bien souvent des difficultés financières. Notre lobby sera là pour leur
venir en aide et leur permettre de continuer leur travail au sein d’une structure plus
sécurisante capable de protéger leurs intérêts et de les défendre face aux
agissements de l’Etat.

Notre lobby aidera aussi tous les journalistes indépendants et les structures
d'information alternative qui existent sur le web mais qui ne disposent en général que
de très peu de moyens financiers. Ces gens qui tentent d'informer les citoyens avec
des bouts de ficelles méritent notre soutien !

Grâce à notre lobby, nous ferons le nécessaire pour obtenir le soutien des pays non-
alignés qui osent encore s'opposer aux USA et à l'impérialisme sioniste afin de
pouvoir peser de plus en plus sur nos dirigeants mais aussi sur nos médias. Pour
réaliser cet axe du bien, il sera important d'organiser des voyages à l'étranger,
au Moyen-Orient, en Russie ou en Amérique du Sud afin d'y rencontrer des
responsables et des personnalités politiques pour élaborer avec elles une
politique et des actions communes.

Il est temps de mettre sur pied une diplomatie parallèle à celle menée par nos
responsables politiques. Ce n'est donc pas qu'un simple lobby que nous vous


proposons de créer mais bien une alternative solide et réfléchie à la société
dans laquelle nous vivons ! Vous seuls pouvez nous aider à construire ce projet et à lutter contre le mal !







Vous qui savez la réalité du monde dans lequel nous vivons pouvez aider à la
libération de l'Europe et de la Palestine en finançant ce lobby qui informera la
population européenne sur les crimes du sionisme, les manipulations
médiatiques et politiques et les dérives de l'Etat d'Israël.

Ainsi, en donnant la parole aux victimes du sionisme dans le monde, nous
informerons les citoyens des crimes du sionisme et nous inciterons les
Européens à réclamer la libération de toutes les terres occupées ! Nous
n’entendons jamais un Palestinien ou un responsable du Hezbollah dans nos
médias européens qui ne donnent la parole qu’aux oppresseurs. En montrant
la réalité des enfants de Gaza, en incitant les Européens à se mobiliser pour
la justice et la paix en Palestine, nous pourrons combattre l’axe sioniste.



Parce que vous avez conscience des manipulations médiatiques, vous seuls
pouvez nous aider à mettre fin aux guerres du mensonge menées par nos
pays aux 4 coins du monde et qui tuent des milliers de civils innocents au nom
du terrorisme sioniste, du dieu dollar ou d'intérêts économiques et géo-
politiques

Coût de lancement du projet pour Bruxelles

Acquisition du matériel informatique et multimédia professionnel: 5000 euros.
Loyer et Garantie locative pour la location du siège à Bruxelles: en général
versement de 3 mois de loyers sur un compte bloqué au nom du bailleur. Cette
somme pourra être récupérée à la fin du bail. Au niveau du loyer, pour un simple
bureau à Bruxelles, il faut compter 1000 euros de loyer par mois. Pour louer un
bâtiment style « ambassade » il faut compter entre 2000 à 3500 euros par mois.

Coût mensuel du projet à Bruxelles: pour fonctionner convenablement, le présent lobby aura besoin d’un budget mensuel
variant entre minimum 3000 euros et idéalement 7500 euros pour couvrir les charges
locatives du siège, l’organisation d’évènements, la réalisation de projets concrets, la
réalisation de vidéos de propagande, la présence quotidienne sur les réseaux
sociaux et la rémunération de ses collaborateurs. Bien entendu, plus nous
disposerons de moyens financiers et plus nous pourrons multiplier nos collaborateurs
et nos actions.

						




	
 
A vous de jouer, vous savez l'homme que
 je suis, vous savez les valeurs qui sont les miennes, vous m'avez vu 
affronter les élus de mon pays seul contre tous, vous m'avez vu défendre
 des valeurs nobles face à des politiciens immoraux, vous m'avez vu 
sacrifier mes intérêts personnels pour défendre le bien commun, vous 
m'avez vu m'opposer de plein fouet à Israël en dénonçant ses crimes, 
vous m'avez vu aux côtés des victimes du sionisme et des manipulations 
médiatiques, je vous demande juste de m'aider par votre contribution 
financière pour créer le monde de demain ! 


 Tous les dons sont les bienvenus et seront utiles. Partagez au 
maximum ce projet auprès de vos amis et de vos connaissances. Vous 
pouvez tous être les acteurs du changement ! 


PS: Avec 3000 à 5000 euros par mois, nous
 pourrons développer un vrai lobby qui fonctionnera à temps plein et qui
 mènera des actions concrètes sur le terrain et sur le net. 5000 euros 
par mois, c'est peu et c'est beaucoup à la fois mais sincèrement, je 
crois que le projet en vaut la peine. Bien entendu, plus nous 
récolterons et plus nous pourrons améliorer notre fonctionnement. 
N'attendons plus une aide extérieure, investissons-nous et donnons-nous 
les moyens de libérer nos pays des maux qui l'oppriment ! L'heure de la révolte a sonné ! Organisons-nous pour assurer notre victoire !

PS: Pour ceux qui ne le connaitraient pas, voici qui est Laurent LOUIS:

Elu au Parlement fédéral belge en juin 2010, Laurent LOUIS a fait trembler la
politique belge durant son mandat. Grâce à ses interventions dérangeantes et à
contre courant de la politique gouvernementale belge et européenne, Laurent LOUIS
est parvenu à rassembler derrière lui une frange importante de la population belge
tout en bénéficiant d’un capital sympathie en France mais aussi dans différents pays
du monde, en Afrique et au Moyen-Orient. 

Jamais jusqu’ici un député belge n’était
parvenu à faire autant parler de lui à l’étranger, signe que le poids des mots et des
images est considérable dans le monde actuel.

					




Pour concrétiser ce soutien, le mouvement Debout Les Belges fut créé en novembre
2013 en vue des élections fédérales, régionales et européennes de mai 2014.
Debout Les Belges proposait un programme politique novateur s’opposant aux
lobbys pharmaceutiques, à la mondialisation, à l’impérialisme, au néo-colonialisme,
au sionisme, à la franc-maçonnerie et proposant aux citoyens belges une révolution
démocratique basée sur la suppression des partis politiques et la création d’un
Parlement citoyen libéré des lobbys.


En quelques semaines, se basant sur un travail parlementaire atypique le
mouvement Debout Les Belges connut un succès dépassant toutes les attentes en
atteignant les 10 000 membres, un chiffre faisant de Debout Les Belges la 4ème force
politique en Belgique francophone. Le mouvement était pourtant censuré par les
médias qui l’ignoraient totalement. Pas une interview que ce soit à la télévision, à la
radio ou même dans la presse écrite. Le mouvement dérangeait et il ne fallait surtout
pas en parler...

Malgré cela, Debout Les Belges réalisa de très bons résultats aux élections de mai
2014 récoltant près de 100 000 voix en Belgique francophone. Des élections qui
furent marquées par un nombre particulièrement élevé de dysfonctionnements. Des
ordinateurs en panne, des bulletins perdus, des urnes ouvertes, des résultats
manipulés, des bulletins de vote au nom du mouvement retrouvés dans des
poubelles et un nombre particulièrement important de bulletins nuls...

La meilleure performance du mouvement eut lieu dans le Hainaut où Laurent LOUIS
était candidat tête de liste au fédéral. Sa liste fit près de 25 000 voix à elle toute
seule.

A titre personnel, avec un budget électoral de 3000 euros (!!!), Laurent LOUIS fit un
score exceptionnel. Avec plus de 13 000 voix de préférence, Laurent LOUIS a
obtenu le 7ème meilleur score de la province.

Malheureusement, malgré ce score, Laurent LOUIS ne fut pas élu. Il y avait pourtant
18 sièges à pourvoir en Hainaut mais malgré qu’il ait obtenu le 7ème meilleur score, la
loi électorale belge ne lui permit pas de conserver son siège au Parlement.

Une aberration du système belge prétendument démocratique.





Obtenir un tel score sans avoir la parole dans les médias est totalement
exceptionnel. Cela démontre que Debout Les Belges et sa figure de proue sont
parvenus à toucher les citoyens et à se faire connaître malgré la censure médiatique
et l’oppression de l’Etat grâce avant tout à internet et aux réseaux sociaux.

Situation totalement surréaliste dans un pays qui se veut démocratique, le
mouvement Debout Les Belges n’a jamais pu ouvrir un compte en banque auprès
d’une banque belge, rendant de la sorte impossible toute contribution financière de
ses 10 000 membres, des ressources qui lui auraient pourtant permis de mener une
campagne électorale bien plus efficace.

Pour contrer un mouvement qu’il considérait comme dangereux, l’Etat avait décidé
de le priver de tout moyen financier.

Malgré ces difficultés, Debout Les Belges est parvenu à rassembler de très
nombreux jeunes, souvent issus de l’immigration, de différentes confessions
religieuses mais aussi de très nombreux Belges de souche exclus du système,
défavorisés qui ne connaissaient rien à la politique et qui sont devenus des activistes
de notre cause.

Malheureusement privés de moyens financiers, Debout Les Belges a du depuis
quelques mois suspendre ses activités. Trop de nos membres subissaient des
sanctions de natures diverses de la part des autorités en rapport avec leur
engagement envers notre mouvement (licenciements, perte d’un logement social,
pressions politiques et policières, etc...). Pour protéger ses membres, il a été décidé
de mettre le mouvement en veille.
Pour pouvoir poursuivre son combat et développer un vrai 
mouvement solide, Laurent LOUIS fait désormais appel à votre aide et à 
votre soutien financier. Avec lui, construisez le monde de demain !",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h3>The music video is being partially funded by the band members of Pagliacci, yet our ambitions for the concept have compelled us to try and raise more money to make it as great as we envision it. Below are examples of how your contribution will help us make this project a success!<p><br/></p>
<h4>Camera &amp; Lenses - RED EPIC Camera package &amp; Zeiss Lenses</h4>For any non tech or film people, we’re competing with high end music videos for a fraction of the budget and to do that, we need an “EPIC” camera. Your contribution will allow us to shoot on this professional camera, with which we’ll capture a great image quality, fantastic slow motion and have the flexibility to achieve the exact look we want. Resulting in that that extra “pop” and making everything from the snowflakes to the mountains look magical.</div>
<h4>Animation</h4>
<p>Your contribution will help us to realise our vision of bringing elements of the nature and forest animals to life. We plan to utilise a combination of classic 2D cel animation, 3D animation and stop motion animation which will be a major influence on the visual style of the video.</p>
<div>
<h4>Production Design</h4>We’re going to be making costumes for our characters and there are various props that will need making and set design pieces constructing. Your contribution will allow us to purchase the materials necessary to create these.</div>

<h4>Travel expenses, Food &amp; Sweden</h4>We’re going to be shooting out in the snow and will need hot food and drinks to keep our crew and band members morale strong.  In addition to this, a portion of our shoot takes place in Sweden, featuring the songs' mystery guest singer. With your help we can get there to make the most of their contribution by having them involved in the video.

The storyline follows three supernatural embodiments of nature - the forest SPIRIT, the haunted FAIRY and an underground VOICE. The visual style will be cold and abstract, yet capturing the beauty of the awakening of the day, portraying the forest as a living creature in itself.

The story starts with the spirit who awakes the forest and brings in the light of the new day. The fairy walks through the forest looking for a place to hide from the underground voice who is singing to her through the ground beneath the trees, the flowers and birds in the forest.

THE BAND‘A PLACE TO HIDE’ is an atmospheric art metal song by the upcoming Bulgarian band ‘PAGLIACCI’, soon to release their first album in 2016. This is the second collaboration between the band and the young director ANNA DAMASKOVA.

Resulting in that that extra “pop” and making everything from the snowflakes to the mountains look magical.
Animation
Your contribution will help us to realise our vision of bringing elements of the nature and forest animals to life. We plan to utilise a combination of classic 2D cel animation, 3D animation and stop motion animation which will be a major influence on the visual style of the video.

Production DesignWe’re going to be making costumes for our characters and there are various props that will need making and set design pieces constructing. Your contribution will allow us to purchase the materials necessary to create these.

Poster Design
We will be having some no doubt amazing and bizarre original artwork designed for promoting the video by Teodor Georgiev. Check his Tumblr to see his latest work!

  

Travel expenses, Food & SwedenWe’re going to be shooting out in the snow and will need hot food and drinks to keep our crew and band members morale strong.  In addition to this, a portion of our shoot takes place in Sweden, featuring the songs' mystery guest singer. With your help we can get there to make the most of their contribution by having them involved in the video. We will also need to reimburse crew travel costs and cover the little boring but important stuff like tape, batteries, stationary, hard drives.

<div>For those who don't know me, I'm a pianist, singer-songwriter and dancer from Northern Wisconsin. At age 14 I became a dedicated student of Latin pianist and educator Rebeca Mauleón-Santana in San Francisco and have continued to study Cuban music obsessively over the last eleven years. When I was 15 I started sneaking into clubs in the Twin Cities to sub as a pianist with every Latin band in town, including a group called Salsabrosa which I now direct and perform with full-time. At 17, I started my own band with some of the best Latin players in the cities. We toured a bit and made a CD called La Banda Nueva: Live at the Alvord. As a dancer, I've studied Afro-Cuban and salsa extensively and have been teaching and performing this style for about 10 years. I've been living in St. Paul, Minnesota since 2012 pursuing a degree at McNally Smith College of Music on a Presidential Scholarship and performing throughout the Midwest. </div>

Angels' Share Glass is a family glassblowing company based in Bridge of Allan, near Stirling. Created by Master Glassblower Thomas Young and his daughter Karen Somerville, the company produces handmade glass whisky gifts using traditional glassblowing techniques which Tom has perfected in a career spanning over 60 years, much of which involved the whisky industry.
Starting in 2013, the company has outgrown the temporary home studio which allowed us to grow this far and we now need to build a bigger one with updated equipment to allow us to meet demand for our products as well as create a place to train the next generation of glassblowers.
This studio will enable us to reach our full potential and provide the necessary space to tutor apprentices and keep the glassblowing craft alive.
   Why Do We Need Your Help?
To build and kit out our new studio we need £25,000. This is broken down as follows:




Kiln £5000


Lathe £5000


Extraction system
£5000


Glassblowing torches £1000


Glass polishing
and cutting equipment £1000


Installation £3000


Legal and compliance £5000



In return for helping us achieve our goal we have several unique and special perks available as a way of showing our appreciation.
As we make all our products by hand we can create small runs of limited and special edition Angels and glassware as perks which will not be available to anyone outside of the crowdfunding campaign. Also, once we have our new completed studio, we will be able to have visitors and our top perk gives you the opportunity to spend the day with Tom learning the craft and creating your own pieces.
All funds raised, whether we reach our target or not, will go towards the build of our new studio. 
   What Will This Means To Us?
This campaign is more than just helping a business to grow: it is essential to help us train new glassblowers and keep this traditional craft alive.

We think it's important for this way of glassmaking to remain and we'll also be able to offer classes and training to the public.
