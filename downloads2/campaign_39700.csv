<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Small organizations like Project WET are able to have a much bigger impact than large organizations because they work one-on-one with people in the communities they serve.

<p>Of all the things I have been fortunate enough to do in my life: Guiding in the White Mountains for Mowglis, School of the Open,  Serving as a Senator in the New Hampshire Senate, Democratic Nominee for Governor of New Hampshire, Publisher of a magazine and CEO of a public company; the work I have done in West Africa is among the most gratifying.</p>
<p>I have been going to West Africa since I first took a team of people there on behalf of the Ford Foundation in 1997. Since that time the team has broadened to include people on both continents and many companies and organizations that enthusiastically have joined together with us.</p>
<p>For more than four years we have been working on the ideas and technology behind the Phoenix Project. </p>
<p>It began simply as a determination to clean up oil spills in the Niger Delta. Spills that were being ignored. The problem in the Niger Delta is huge.</p><p></p><h3>

</h3><h3></h3><p>But as we began to explore the ways of dealing with the oil spills we realized that with the right technologies and a determination to use the resources required for the cleanup to do MORE than just clean up the spill - we could do something extraordinary. </p>
<p>We could create a Phoenix Effect . . .</p>
<p>This is the term we use to describe a powerful multi-dimensional outcome with a broad-based solution to a problem that traditionally sees only one dimensional approaches. Creating a beautiful flowering of positive outcomes . . . a renaissance, a rebirth that touches us in many ways. </p>
<p>In  our specific case, we could create an “Enterprise Recovery and Empowerment Zone” using the clean up process to create both a cleaner environment and an enterprise community built around it.</p>
<p>Better still, we could do this in a way that would be sustainable, replicable, carbon negative and (hopefully) profitable enough to leave the community with a source of electricity before moving on to the next Zone repeating the process again.</p>
<p>Just imagine  . . . We identify the Zone for cleanup. Keeping in mind that our goals for the future include not only a rebirth of the land but an economic renaissance for the region.</p>
<p><a href=""http://nigerdeltaphoenix.blogspot.com/2014/04/mop-maximum-oil-pickup.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We use sustainable technologies to clean up the oil, recovering and recycling as much of the oil spilled as possible and recover and recycle the oil</a>.<span><br/></span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F8XcIb5btkXk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8XcIb5btkXk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F8XcIb5btkXk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h3></h3><p>From the biomass created during the cleanup, we create electricity for communities that may never have had access to reliable and affordable electricity - employing a new Thermal Recovery technology - gassifying the biomass - in a green pyrolysis plant;</p>
<p>The pyrolysis plant is mobile and small enough to fit on a trailer truck bed. It is a closed system plant for cleanly and sustainably processing the biomass, producing electricity and biochar.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F9ADu9ZGTDbc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9ADu9ZGTDbc&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9ADu9ZGTDbc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Biochar is a powerful soil amendment (fertilizer) that has been demonstrated to enhance agricultural productivity by as much as 400%. Biochar is also a carbon sink that captures and stores carbon - making the entire process CARBON NEGATIVE; </p>
<p>Biochar can be employed to help restore the lands being cleaned up and also sold to support the other activities of the Enterprise and Empowerment Zone. Furthermore, it appears that biochar production and usage will qualify under the Kyoto protocols for the sale of green energy credits.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, we create entrepreneurial and research opportunities in Agriculture, oil spill remediation; climate change remediation, bio-fuel production and electricity generation and probably dozens of other ideas that we have not yet thought of yet!</p>
<p>All of this yields a model that we will share openly with the world. A sustainable open source solution to oil spill pollution.</p>
<p>While this crowd funding campaign is aimed at raising the seed funding for the reconnaissance mission to identify the Zone, meet with the key constituencies and craft agreements, we want to share the details for the entire project that we have painstakingly developed over the last four years.  </p><p>We want to do this for several reasons: So that you understand the vision and the technology as completely as you wish to.  Our transparency and your confidence in our work will, we believe, spur you to make every effort to help us spread the word, to help us raise the revenues and to generate new ideas for research and entrepreneurial projects that could grow from these efforts.</p>
<p>Every dollar, euro, yen, uwan, nira, pound raised will be used to make this powerful idea a reality. Any funds raised beyond those needed for seeding the Phoenix Project will go directly toward covering the balance we need to raise to complete the project - especially covering the cost of the power plant which we hope to be able to gift to the community to act as the critical mass for the future operations of the Enterprise and Empowerment Zone.</p>
<p>The Crowd Funding campaign to seed the project hopes to raise $85,000. These funds will be used to cover costs of bringing together all of the  stakeholders and the expertise needed to move forward; identifying the area to establish the Zone; creating the legal agreements necessary for moving ahead; </p>
<p>Because the Niger Delta is a dangerous place, security costs play a fairly significant role in the cost of the reconnaissance mission. The recon mission will bring the team together with community leaders, government officials and oil company representatives to select the area that will be designated as the first Enterprise and Empowerment Zone. We will be issuing a paper during the first week of the crowd funding campaign that will describe, in detail, the process of site selection.</p><p>While we hope that you will want to donate and share information about the Phoenix Project with your family, friends and social networks because the people of the Niger Delta deserve better than they have gotten, we have some amazing perks nonetheless including one of a kind bracelets, necklaces and earrings crafted from West African gemstones and baubles by Loba, an artist who creates sustainable artwork she calls gemstone finery and beaded frippery.</p><p>No Food For Lazy Man - a sustainable drum maker in Accra will be creating Djembe drums and a number of limited edition posters and fine art prints are also among the cool perks.</p><p>When this portion of the Phoenix Project is complete, we hope to have identified a site for the first Enterprise and recovery zone; </p><p>We plan to make this project work no matter what it takes so if we don't reach our goal we will still continue to move forward. But we believe that this idea will catch fire because it is both replicable and sustainable and offers an opportunity to test a concept that could have world wide implications for oil spill cleanup, poverty alleviation and community economic development.</p><p><a href=""https://abce7758-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/electroniccommunityproject/Home/project-phoenix/Concept_Niger_Delta_May28_2014_all.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqM4XGLzhhTkQ1jYCSYgPA3x10lmbMwEg5UbssMY1grV1hmXsnsF711j6UOEVgOLBNaOCtxVUJwhNnycpQ2bbbrnPiq7UhqtNx2hj_8TyLU3EJ-PD6MLOR7GHefV-ZFFDUSYJF324F6k24hbB7_aPFqtSVQc0vHx8kReUClu4mHF-q_W6-VyuueXj15u2cVdz8GITmfG2jk622hFpw-2ictba6lfyKLx750-HnsvYHj4S5hjG_rJUu_5tq8RlqoOkVkRbmlJuj8IItUVZdsWR-EUi-c1M2bjPvo1KFbwmygt6RrK0I%3D&amp;attredirects=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read the comprehensive Concept Paper for the Phoenix Project here</a>.</p><h3>How can I Help?</h3><h3><ol>

<p>
</p><p>Many companies have explored the option of purchasing offsets to ameliorate or “Offset” their carbon consumption. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case we have devised our donation methodology and explanation of benefits and perquisites (Perks) in a way that recognizes the fact that each of us, no matter how conscientious we are about our consumption, plays a role in the pressure that has created the environmental woes of the Niger Delta and that the Phoenix Project- Niger Delta’s Enterprise Zone, when operational, will be generating electricity for the community and creating jobs, generating wealth AND creating a CARBON-NEGATIVE environment. While we are NOT providing offsets that would meet the rigorous standards of an offset audit, we are providing “peace-of-mind” or ""ethical"" offsets. We are simply trying to get you to understand that your actions will in fact ethically-offset your consumption!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some folks have asked us why we are doing this in an area as dangerous as the Niger Delta. The answer in short is that the Niger Delta is where it is needed most and we refuse to allow terrorists or profit-crazy oil companies to prevent us from moving forward with this important mission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have some very cool perks to offer, but the most important thing that you will receive is the pride associated with playing your part in helping to launch an effort that will not only clean up oil spills in the Niger Delta but use the profits generated by the cleanup to create good jobs, generate wealth and entrepreneurial opportunity for young people; and, opportunities that will empower women and men in the Niger Delta.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every dollar that we raise over and above our target for the reconnaissance mission will go directly toward the full development of the first Enterprise Recovery and EmpowermentZone.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b>#1 The Nigerian Danfo Ride or Lawnmower Fill Offset </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/607471/files/20140527113904-danfo.jpg?1401215944"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>$1- $10.00 USD or equivalent <span><br/></span></b><b>You’re a member of the Team!</b></p>
<p>Catching a ride on a Danfo (above) or filling your lawnmower will run you somewhere in this price range. If you’ve done either of these things in the last year, you can offset the carbon by donating a like amount to the Phoenix Project - Niger Delta.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Perk: We’ll thank you by listing your name on our “Heroes Wall” on the Phoenix Project Blog. </p>
<p><b>#2 The Taxi Ride or 10 6-packs of soda</b>
</p>
<p><b>$11 - 50.00 </b></p>
<p>If you took a Taxi in New York City recently you paid more than $11 just to get into the taxi, but in most of the rest of the world this is the range of a standard Taxi ride. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The soda may surprise you. Every time you drink a soda in a plastic bottle, 1/3 of the volume of that soda was required in oil to manufacture the bottle.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In either case, your generous commitment of $11-50 will offset that taxi ride or those sodas and will get us farther down the road toward a day when we can make the process for establishing the Enterprise zone open source information allowing any community with an oil spill to do it themselves if they choose.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Perk</b>: We’ll send you a thank you email and proudly display your name and residence on a plaque at the Enterprise Zone. Permanently enshrining your place in this historic effort.</p>
<p><b>#3 The Fill Up ""Offset""</b></p>
<p><b>$51 - $100.00</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/607491/files/20140527114729-Fill_rt_Up_Crop.jpg?1401216449"" src="""" style=""width: 211.343653250774px; height: 322px;""/></p>
<p>Whether you drive a hybrid or an SUV filling your vehicle just one time is going to run you somewhere in this price range. If you are in the US, chances are that the gasoline comes from one of the 543,000 barrels a day of oil imported into the US from Nigeria - almost all of it from the Niger Delta. If you are in Europe, Nigeria is the 5th largest supplier - but the situation in Ukraine likely will have an impact on this perhaps moving Nigeria to a higher level.. </p>

<p><b>$100 - $200 USD or equivalent</b></p>
<p>If you have a generator that needs filling, or if you commute to work and wanted a  Peace-of-Mind offset of the carbon for either of these items the cost will be somewhere in this range. </p>

<p><b>$201 - 500 USD or equivalent</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not doing long distance driving and you are careful about heating your home, the cost associated with this equivalent offset is probably close to what you spend for gas or to fill a heating oil tank.  Your generous contribution to the Phoenix Project at this level will yield peace of mind that you have taken an action that will offset well over the equivalent value of carbon with your contribution.</p>

<b>#6 The Semi-Truck Fillup or Airfare ""Offset""</b><p><b>$501 - $999</b></p>
<p>Whether you drive a truck and have had to fill up your semi, or shipped something with a truck recently or took a flight, you consumed a lot of fuel. Your donation will provide a ""Peace-of-Mind"" offset of that consumption, bringing the day closer when Carbon Negative energy will be produced in the Niger Delta, driving economic growth, jobs and a cleaner environment.</p>

Of all the things I have been fortunate enough to do in my life: Guiding in the White Mountains for Mowglis, School of the Open,  Serving as a Senator in the New Hampshire Senate, Democratic Nominee for Governor of New Hampshire, Publisher of a magazine and CEO of a public company; the work I have done in West Africa is among the most gratifying.
I have been going to West Africa since I first took a team of people there on behalf of the Ford Foundation in 1997. Since that time the team has broadened to include people on both continents and many companies and organizations that enthusiastically have joined together with us.
For more than four years we have been working on the ideas and technology behind the Phoenix Project. 
It began simply as a determination to clean up oil spills in the Niger Delta. Spills that were being ignored. The problem in the Niger Delta is huge.



But as we began to explore the ways of dealing with the oil spills we realized that with the right technologies and a determination to use the resources required for the cleanup to do MORE than just clean up the spill - we could do something extraordinary. 
We could create a Phoenix Effect . . .
This is the term we use to describe a powerful multi-dimensional outcome with a broad-based solution to a problem that traditionally sees only one dimensional approaches. Creating a beautiful flowering of positive outcomes . . . a renaissance, a rebirth that touches us in many ways. 
In  our specific case, we could create an “Enterprise Recovery and Empowerment Zone” using the clean up process to create both a cleaner environment and an enterprise community built around it.
Better still, we could do this in a way that would be sustainable, replicable, carbon negative and (hopefully) profitable enough to leave the community with a source of electricity before moving on to the next Zone repeating the process again.
Just imagine  . . . We identify the Zone for cleanup. Keeping in mind that our goals for the future include not only a rebirth of the land but an economic renaissance for the region.
We use sustainable technologies to clean up the oil, recovering and recycling as much of the oil spilled as possible and recover and recycle the oil.From the biomass created during the cleanup, we create electricity for communities that may never have had access to reliable and affordable electricity - employing a new Thermal Recovery technology - gassifying the biomass - in a green pyrolysis plant;
The pyrolysis plant is mobile and small enough to fit on a trailer truck bed. It is a closed system plant for cleanly and sustainably processing the biomass, producing electricity and biochar.
Biochar is a powerful soil amendment (fertilizer) that has been demonstrated to enhance agricultural productivity by as much as 400%. Biochar is also a carbon sink that captures and stores carbon - making the entire process CARBON NEGATIVE; 
Biochar can be employed to help restore the lands being cleaned up and also sold to support the other activities of the Enterprise and Empowerment Zone. Furthermore, it appears that biochar production and usage will qualify under the Kyoto protocols for the sale of green energy credits.
In addition to all this, we create entrepreneurial and research opportunities in Agriculture, oil spill remediation; climate change remediation, bio-fuel production and electricity generation and probably dozens of other ideas that we have not yet thought of yet!
All of this yields a model that we will share openly with the world. A sustainable open source solution to oil spill pollution.
While this crowd funding campaign is aimed at raising the seed funding for the reconnaissance mission to identify the Zone, meet with the key constituencies and craft agreements, we want to share the details for the entire project that we have painstakingly developed over the last four years.  We want to do this for several reasons: So that you understand the vision and the technology as completely as you wish to.  Our transparency and your confidence in our work will, we believe, spur you to make every effort to help us spread the word, to help us raise the revenues and to generate new ideas for research and entrepreneurial projects that could grow from these efforts.
Every dollar, euro, yen, uwan, nira, pound raised will be used to make this powerful idea a reality. Any funds raised beyond those needed for seeding the Phoenix Project will go directly toward covering the balance we need to raise to complete the project - especially covering the cost of the power plant which we hope to be able to gift to the community to act as the critical mass for the future operations of the Enterprise and Empowerment Zone.
The Crowd Funding campaign to seed the project hopes to raise $85,000. These funds will be used to cover costs of bringing together all of the  stakeholders and the expertise needed to move forward; identifying the area to establish the Zone; creating the legal agreements necessary for moving ahead; 
Because the Niger Delta is a dangerous place, security costs play a fairly significant role in the cost of the reconnaissance mission. The recon mission will bring the team together with community leaders, government officials and oil company representatives to select the area that will be designated as the first Enterprise and Empowerment Zone. We will be issuing a paper during the first week of the crowd funding campaign that will describe, in detail, the process of site selection.While we hope that you will want to donate and share information about the Phoenix Project with your family, friends and social networks because the people of the Niger Delta deserve better than they have gotten, we have some amazing perks nonetheless including one of a kind bracelets, necklaces and earrings crafted from West African gemstones and baubles by Loba, an artist who creates sustainable artwork she calls gemstone finery and beaded frippery.No Food For Lazy Man - a sustainable drum maker in Accra will be creating Djembe drums and a number of limited edition posters and fine art prints are also among the cool perks.When this portion of the Phoenix Project is complete, we hope to have identified a site for the first Enterprise and recovery zone; We plan to make this project work no matter what it takes so if we don't reach our goal we will still continue to move forward. But we believe that this idea will catch fire because it is both replicable and sustainable and offers an opportunity to test a concept that could have world wide implications for oil spill cleanup, poverty alleviation and community economic development.Read the comprehensive Concept Paper for the Phoenix Project here.How can I Help?

About our PerksEquivalent Offsets and Cool Perquisites (Perks)

Many companies have explored the option of purchasing offsets to ameliorate or “Offset” their carbon consumption. 

In this case we have devised our donation methodology and explanation of benefits and perquisites (Perks) in a way that recognizes the fact that each of us, no matter how conscientious we are about our consumption, plays a role in the pressure that has created the environmental woes of the Niger Delta and that the Phoenix Project- Niger Delta’s Enterprise Zone, when operational, will be generating electricity for the community and creating jobs, generating wealth AND creating a CARBON-NEGATIVE environment. While we are NOT providing offsets that would meet the rigorous standards of an offset audit, we are providing “peace-of-mind” or ""ethical"" offsets. We are simply trying to get you to understand that your actions will in fact ethically-offset your consumption!

Some folks have asked us why we are doing this in an area as dangerous as the Niger Delta. The answer in short is that the Niger Delta is where it is needed most and we refuse to allow terrorists or profit-crazy oil companies to prevent us from moving forward with this important mission.

We have some very cool perks to offer, but the most important thing that you will receive is the pride associated with playing your part in helping to launch an effort that will not only clean up oil spills in the Niger Delta but use the profits generated by the cleanup to create good jobs, generate wealth and entrepreneurial opportunity for young people; and, opportunities that will empower women and men in the Niger Delta.

Every dollar that we raise over and above our target for the reconnaissance mission will go directly toward the full development of the first Enterprise Recovery and EmpowermentZone.


Our Perks


#1 The Nigerian Danfo Ride or Lawnmower Fill Offset 


$1- $10.00 USD or equivalent You’re a member of the Team!
Catching a ride on a Danfo (above) or filling your lawnmower will run you somewhere in this price range. If you’ve done either of these things in the last year, you can offset the carbon by donating a like amount to the Phoenix Project - Niger Delta.


Perk: We’ll thank you by listing your name on our “Heroes Wall” on the Phoenix Project Blog. 
#2 The Taxi Ride or 10 6-packs of soda

$11 - 50.00 
If you took a Taxi in New York City recently you paid more than $11 just to get into the taxi, but in most of the rest of the world this is the range of a standard Taxi ride. 


The soda may surprise you. Every time you drink a soda in a plastic bottle, 1/3 of the volume of that soda was required in oil to manufacture the bottle.


In either case, your generous commitment of $11-50 will offset that taxi ride or those sodas and will get us farther down the road toward a day when we can make the process for establishing the Enterprise zone open source information allowing any community with an oil spill to do it themselves if they choose.


Perk: We’ll send you a thank you email and proudly display your name and residence on a plaque at the Enterprise Zone. Permanently enshrining your place in this historic effort.
#3 The Fill Up ""Offset""
$51 - $100.00


Whether you drive a hybrid or an SUV filling your vehicle just one time is going to run you somewhere in this price range. If you are in the US, chances are that the gasoline comes from one of the 543,000 barrels a day of oil imported into the US from Nigeria - almost all of it from the Niger Delta. If you are in Europe, Nigeria is the 5th largest supplier - but the situation in Ukraine likely will have an impact on this perhaps moving Nigeria to a higher level.. 


The Perk
Best Friend’s Dreams LImited Edition Poster
16” x 22” Limited Edition, Digitally signed, poster by renowned artist and team leader Wayne King. Features the following quote: “A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and sings it back to you when you have forgotten how it goes.”










#4  Filling The Generator or a Month of Commuting
$100 - $200 USD or equivalent
If you have a generator that needs filling, or if you commute to work and wanted a  Peace-of-Mind offset of the carbon for either of these items the cost will be somewhere in this range. 



Perk: Project Phoenix T Shirt: We’ll thank you for your contribution at this level with a Project Phoenix T-Shirt.

#5 Offset A Month of Gas Fills or  Heating Oil Fillup
$201 - 500 USD or equivalent

If you are not doing long distance driving and you are careful about heating your home, the cost associated with this equivalent offset is probably close to what you spend for gas or to fill a heating oil tank.  Your generous contribution to the Phoenix Project at this level will yield peace of mind that you have taken an action that will offset well over the equivalent value of carbon with your contribution.

Perk: We will thank you with a beautiful signed fine art print  of a young man looking to the sea entitled: “To Dream”  from a special limited edition of only 100 (12” x 16”)  prints. This is a fine art Giclee print using archival inks on 100% rag fine art paper signed by the artist and numbered. 
#6 The Semi-Truck Fillup or Airfare ""Offset""$501 - $999
Whether you drive a truck and have had to fill up your semi, or shipped something with a truck recently or took a flight, you consumed a lot of fuel. Your donation will provide a ""Peace-of-Mind"" offset of that consumption, bringing the day closer when Carbon Negative energy will be produced in the Niger Delta, driving economic growth, jobs and a cleaner environment.


Perk: “Sustainable Gemstone Finery and beaded Frippery by Loba”. Choose between ear rings, bracelets and necklaces created especially for the Phoenix Project by the artist Loba (. . .just Loba, like Cher). One-of-a-kind beautiful jewelry incorporating beads and frippery from West Africa as well as other green gemstone finery and frippery. When you make your contribution we will send you a page of selections from which to make your choice.

<p><br/></p>
</span>  Welcome to Earthworks!  We are actively creating a living edible festival grounds for people to come together and celebrate creativity, sustainable living, healing, arts, whole foods, music and more.  The location of these festivals is Finca Fruición, a permaculture-based land cooperative in the southern pacific zone of Costa Rica.  We are raising money specifically to build rain shelters for the workshop zones, children’s Creation Station, dance floor, stage and fire circle, as well as a self-serve kitchen for festival goers to prepare their own food or food that they can purchase from the event's local farmer's market.   We will also be building rainwater cisterns for solar showers and other washing and irrigating needs.<span class=""notranlsate""><br/><br/><p>    The area already has many fruit trees, and is designed as a model food forest/festival grounds, where people can celebrate together while harvesting the abundance of the land.  The structures are all flowing, organic feeling open-air spaces where people can have fun and be protected from the elements. Another exciting feature is that not only will children be welcome, but they will almost have their own mini-festival within the festival!</p>
<p><br/> List of monetary needs:</p>
<p>- A recycling station to put up in a couple of our neighboring villages, to divert their trash, make recycling easy for them, and gather great supplies for some of the wonderfully creative alternative building projects that we have in store.</p>
<p>- An amazing children's Creation Station!</p>
<p>- Workshop space/yoga deck</p>
<p>- Covered stage and dance floor</p>
<p>- Fire circle sky lodge</p>
<p>- More composting toilets (we already have a few)</p>
<p>- Rainwater catchment for solar showers</p>
<p>- Edible plants throughout the festival grounds such as raspberries for boarders, gooseberries, cherry tomatoes, custard apple, rose apple, chayote, bananas, cacao, ice cream beans and many more.</p>
<p>- Shovels, picks, tamping rods, and other needed tools to keep the troops busy.</p>
<p>- Videography</p>
<p>- All the sweet gifts that we get to mail out to you and the rest of our amazing supporters!</p>
<p><br/>   This is just the start.  With this base infrastructure set, we will begin the hosting of a series of annual week-long Eco-Festivals, changing the way our culture experiences music festivals.  The great thing about this festival is that it will get more and more magical, year after year, as the participants make personal and group contributions to the space for future attendants to come!  The eventuality of the festival is to plant-up and develop the festival grounds, in the first couple years, to the point where the attendants are comfortably enjoying their self-made solar hot showers, communal kitchen, composting toilets, tiki torch lit pathways, and a host of other fun and beautiful enhancements to the park, and from there, begin traveling outside of the park to the local school, community center, etc.  While we will be doing at least one outreach project per event, to begin with, we anticipate establishing a stable, self-maintaining, edible hosting grounds, from which the majority of the projects will then turn to benefit the surrounding villages in our area.</p>
<p>  If you’ve traveled Central America, you probably know that bananas, cows and coffee have become the predominant income source for many farmers in many regions, which has significantly impacted Costa Rica’s otherwise rich bio-diversity.  Earthworks festival grounds and host farm are already a rich sanctuary for flora and fauna, and it is one of the festival’s chief aims to re-seed the region’s biodiversity and regenerate its precious biological corridors.  We have already established a working relationship with Community Carbon Trees Costa Rica who will be aiding our efforts with generous donations of native and fruiting trees to use in the regeneration and reforestation outreach projects to come.</p>
<p><br/>   And none of this will be possible without a good dose of FUN!  Focusing on local bands, children's theater, skill toy/flow art classes, group participation park-wide games, costumery, tomfoolery and other random antics, the spirit of Make Believe will be crucial to the health generating focus of the event.  And on that tip, organic food, healing arts, and self-care will be among the highlighted overtones of how we do business.<br/><br/>   We have already invested significant funds into preparing the space for lovely smaller-scale test events that we’ve held over the past few years, and we have good perspective for what more it needs to host a larger and longer celebration.  We have dozens of mature trees already planted throughout the zone, as well as the beginnings of the kids' play tower, trampoline, and more!<br/><br/>   Financial sustainability is an important factor for us in putting on these events and inviting others to participate.  With the ticket sales, our aim is to be able to pay the workshop coordinators, playshop instructors, Creation Station Chiefs, bands and other devoted folks, as well as buy materials, etc.  With your donations we won’t have to struggle, hoping that we break even to cover the infrastructure costs, and simply give thanks to everyone for participating in the festival.  What’s more, if we achieve our goal, we will also be free to donate 12% of all the festival’s proceeds to assist with additional local school and village programs!</p>
<p align=""center"">With your contributions, this can be a rewarding, fun, and far less stressful success for everyone involved!</p>
<p>   Whether you can give a dollar, 5, 25, or 500, <strong>PLEASE</strong> share this campaign with your network.  We are asking for a base amount to set the stage for the first events, but with additional funding there is no limit as to how amazing and far reaching a reality this can become, nor to the amount of people that we can share it with and influence!  In the end, we are aiming to create a new template for festivals that can be reseeded throughout the country and, eventually, abroad as well.  The power we have when we come together in a spirit of harmony is tremendous.  Both this festival and this campaign are testaments to that reality. </p>
<p>Together, we WILL change the world!.  In fact, we already are…<br/> Again, we thank you dearly for your support! <br/></p>

  If you’ve traveled Central America, you probably know that bananas, cows and coffee have become the predominant income source for many farmers in many regions, which has significantly impacted Costa Rica’s otherwise rich bio-diversity.  Earthworks festival grounds and host farm are already a rich sanctuary for flora and fauna, and it is one of the festival’s chief aims to re-seed the region’s biodiversity and regenerate its precious biological corridors.  We have already established a working relationship with Community Carbon Trees Costa Rica who will be aiding our efforts with generous donations of native and fruiting trees to use in the regeneration and reforestation outreach projects to come.
   And none of this will be possible without a good dose of FUN!  Focusing on local bands, children's theater, skill toy/flow art classes, group participation park-wide games, costumery, tomfoolery and other random antics, the spirit of Make Believe will be crucial to the health generating focus of the event.  And on that tip, organic food, healing arts, and self-care will be among the highlighted overtones of how we do business.   We have already invested significant funds into preparing the space for lovely smaller-scale test events that we’ve held over the past few years, and we have good perspective for what more it needs to host a larger and longer celebration.  We have dozens of mature trees already planted throughout the zone, as well as the beginnings of the kids' play tower, trampoline, and more!   Financial sustainability is an important factor for us in putting on these events and inviting others to participate.  With the ticket sales, our aim is to be able to pay the workshop coordinators, playshop instructors, Creation Station Chiefs, bands and other devoted folks, as well as buy materials, etc.  With your donations we won’t have to struggle, hoping that we break even to cover the infrastructure costs, and simply give thanks to everyone for participating in the festival.  What’s more, if we achieve our goal, we will also be free to donate 12% of all the festival’s proceeds to assist with additional local school and village programs!
With your contributions, this can be a rewarding, fun, and far less stressful success for everyone involved!
   Whether you can give a dollar, 5, 25, or 500, PLEASE share this campaign with your network.  We are asking for a base amount to set the stage for the first events, but with additional funding there is no limit as to how amazing and far reaching a reality this can become, nor to the amount of people that we can share it with and influence!  In the end, we are aiming to create a new template for festivals that can be reseeded throughout the country and, eventually, abroad as well.  The power we have when we come together in a spirit of harmony is tremendous.  Both this festival and this campaign are testaments to that reality. 
Together, we WILL change the world!.  In fact, we already are… Again, we thank you dearly for your support!

<h3><strong>What is iPower Station?</strong></h3>
<p>It’s independence. It’s energy security. It’s power freedom when and where you need it.</p>
<p>iPower Station is modular, portable and practical solar power. It smartly combines energy generation, electric storage, and electric supply into a useful mobile power plant. And best of all, it’s open source too.</p>
<p>Many others have tried to build a “utility in a box” prototype - without success. Or they attempt “lock-in” with non-standard components in their proprietary units. Still others over promise with slick marketing - unnecessarily making people overpay for solar.</p>
<p>As military veterans always paying attention to detail, we weren’t impressed. And we decided to do something about it.  iPower Station is NOT a prototype. With more than 3 years invested in design and development, we pay careful attention to details that matter most, including:<br/><br/><strong>1. Proven Technology.</strong> Every iPower Station utilizes technology that’s been field proven for over a decade.</p>
<p><strong>2. Quality Components.</strong> Every iPower Station is built of high quality components, ensuring decades of reliable power.</p>
<p><strong>3. Insanely Great Design.</strong> Designing the iPower Station drove us insane at times, but paid off in the “4 Big Easy”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to set up. Less than a minute to set up and produce power.</li>
<li>Easy to use. Completely “plug-n-play” with everything within easy reach and sight.</li>
<li>Easy to maintain. Stores and transports easily. Almost maintenance free.</li>
<li>Easy to expand. Want more power generation or storage? Just plug it in and go!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a local group of activists working towards a Clean Energy Future.</p>
<p>We have been working on different issues over the passed two years, including deep-sea oil drilling in NZ waters, hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") and educational work around action on Climate Change.</p>
<p>For this crowd funding campaign we would like to concentrate on coal mining on the West Coast of NZ.</p>
<p>We feel that the development of new coal mines is a threat to humanity in a time we should be urgently acting on Climate Change. Furthermore, the proposed coal mines will destroy places of unparalleled natural beauty, rare ecosystems and habitat to endangered endemic species. Many of the areas where coal mines are proposed, are on NZ conservation estate, but our Government is very friendly towards this dirty industry, so unless ordinary people stand up and say Enough!, these places will be lost.</p>
<p>There are a few organizations working on this campaign (through the Courts and building public opinion), but we feel that we need to strenghten a grass roots movement to compliment what bigger organizations with better funding are doing.</p>
<p>The attached video is produced by the Royal Forest&amp;Bird Society who has carried out extensive biodiversity work in the area. It will give you an idea of what is at stake. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the raised funds, we would like to put together campaign materials to educate people about the threat of coal mining and possible alternatives.</p>
<p>The majority of the fundraising however will be put towards equipment for wildlife surveys and field work. We would like to put together a kit containing tents, a portable biodigester toilet, a solar cooker, tarps, GPS and mountain radio, safety gear, first aid kit, food storage and a solar charger for a laptop computer.</p>
<p>We will source as much of the equipment as possible privately. We do not receive contributions from any organization. We will share all equipment, data and people power with anyone involved in stopping coal mining on the West Coast and developing sustainable solutions.</p>

<strong>                                            PHASE 2--The Land</strong><br/><br/><strong>Our Mission</strong>~<br/>    To provide a sanctuary for wolves and wolfdogs.  <br/>    To proffer an inexpensive way and place for people to live.<br/>    To encourage sustainable, simple, healthy, organic lifestyles.<br/>    To preserve ancient land.<br/>    To host workshops and seminars on various topics for healthy living.<br/>    To encourage intentional community involvement.<br/>    To build a sustainable earthen cob village.<br/>    To protect and preserve our planet.<br/>    All of the above, all in one.</h3>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Our Vision</strong>~<br/>    Blue Wolf Sanctuary and Cob Village will rest in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, providing <strong>a sanctuary for wolves and wolf dogs</strong> and creating a cob village (see below for more info on cob) on scenic mountains, ancient lands.  Families and individuals will be able to come to property to live and build a cob home.  Everyone in the intentional living community will pitch in to help and <strong>lovingly welcome the new family to our village and lifestyle.</strong>  With each cob home averaging around $10,000 to build, we can <strong>provide an option for people to live inexpensively and debt-free, with no electricity bills</strong>--our village will be entirely run off of <strong>solar, wind, and hydroelectric power</strong>.  The village will include a bed and breakfast to provide lodging for those traveling, attending seminars, workshops and gatherings, spiritual retreats, or touring the wolf sanctuary. <strong> Organic gardens</strong> will supply the bed and breakfast and the people of the village with<strong> fresh veggies, fruit, and herbs</strong>.  Free range goats, cows, and chickens will provide fresh dairy and eggs. <strong>An artist 'cobstel'</strong> will be available to traveling artists and musicians at a low/no cost/barter.  <strong>An apothecary shed</strong> for hosting workshops and seminars on candle and soap making, lotions, herbal teas, poultices, and other types of herbal remedies.  <strong>Our vision is also our intention, and we hope it will become yours too. Join us!</strong><br/><br/><br/></p>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>What we need:<br/></strong></p>
<p>      Approximately 50 acres in the Appalachian mountain range of western North Carolina will provide adequate space and habitat for our wolves and wolf dogs, village, and gardens.  A waterfall or river on the land will be required for generating hydroelectric power.  A portion of the land will be dedicated to the wolf sanctuary, the other will hold the village and organic gardens. Our goal is acquire the land by spring of 2013, so we can start building and have the sanctuary built and ready before winter--and before hunting season begins next year.</p>
<p>     The funds raised from this campaign will go towards the land we need. If we reach our goal and raise more than is needed for the land, it will go to building costs (Solar panels, kitchen equipment, digging the well, etc) and/or care for the wolves (food, veternarians, housing, etc)  In total, our entire village and wolf sanctuary will cost approximately $300,000. This may seem like a lot, but we are confident that we can do it, especially with your help!</p>

<br/><br/><strong>So..Why Wolves?</strong><br/>    Wolves/wolfdogs may possibly be some of the most misunderstood creatures; they are <strong>highly intelligent, extremely loyal, and compassionate</strong>. They mate for life, have families, and live in packs. It is a common misconception that wolves seek to harm humans.  Wolves are actually afraid of humans; their only true predator is man..<br/>Studies have shown that 60-90% of mortalities in wolves are through human causes via<strong> trapping, poisoning, and hunting</strong>..  
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wolves are not the ""Big Bad Wolf"" as portrayed in fairy tales.</strong> They are timid around humans.</li>
<li>Extinct in many areas of the world; places where they use to run freely and live their life to no avail..</li>
<li>Wolves are so often hunted because they are viewed as a 'threat' to farmers and ranchers. However, according to data released by the USDA in 2011, wolves contributed to less than 1% of all cattle and sheep losses. Wolves do not prefer livestock, and will typically only view it as prey if there is nothing else.</li>
<li>
<strong>Wolves help balance the ecosystem. </strong> Wolves are carnivorous, feeding on herbivores (animals that feed on plant life such as moose, elk, deer, rabbit, and mice). Many of these animals tend to eat large amounts of roots, saplings, shoots, crops, and other plant material. Therefore, crops tend to thrive more lively when the wolves are around.  <strong>This is the balance of life, and wolves are a crucial part of this tenuous balance</strong>. Wolf spelled backwards is flow~</li>
<li>The average life expectancy of a wolf in the wild is 6-8 years, but in captivity they enjoy a lifespan of up to 13-18 years.</li>
<li>When wolves do well, biodiversity thrives.</li>
<li>Wolves have a complex social hierarchy. The pack usually consists of 4-8 wolves, including the Alpha male and female, though larger packs may have two pairs of Alpha male and females to provide structure and insure protection of the pack. Their rank is usually determined by their size and health.</li>
<li>Wolves rarely bark; but they do howl. At any time of day or night. To call to their pack. To communicate to other packs when a large and favorite prey has been discovered. They howl for sheer joy. They howl in warning and in loss.</li>
<li><strong>The world has already lost 7 different species of wolves. </strong></li>
<li><strong>~Extinction is forever~</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>  Blue Wolf plans to provide full housing and any services necessary for wolves.  The nonprofit sanctuary will rest in the Appalachian Mountains, in a habitat where the wolves will thrive happily, have plenty of room to run, and freely express themselves. Blue Wolf is dedicated to help put an end to the wolves' demise through education, rescue efforts, rehabilitation, lobbying, and whatever it takes to help humanity find a way to coexist with them.</p>
 <br/><strong>About Cob~</strong>
<p>    Cob (which means lump) is an ancient method for building and is an efficient use of natural materials. (a mixture of clay, sand, straw, and water).</p>
<ul>
<li> Building with cob is simple, inexpensive, and resourceful--most materials for building can be obtained from the homesite.</li>
<li>No building experience required, and power tools are not necessary.</li>
<li>Aesthetically appealing at a low cost--<strong>a small home can be built for $5000</strong> (If you are resourceful.)</li>
<li>Naturally insulating and durable, with many cob homes<strong> lasting over 700 years</strong> through many natural disasters, and are even fire resistant! In fact, pizza ovens and fireplaces can be made out of cob simply by omitting the straw.</li>
<li>Fully self-sustaining earthen project</li>
<li>We will use only <strong>natural energy: solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.</strong>
</li>
<li>Approximately 30% of the homes in the world are built of earth, and approximately 50% of people in developing countries live in earthen homes.</li>
<li>Easily create storage, shelving, cabinets, furniture, garden walls, countertops, pizza ovens, sink basins, bathtubs, showers, fireplaces and much more out of cob.</li>
<li>Inspires creativity--your home is your canvas!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Living Roofs-a thick blanket of turf,  plants, flowers, and herbs</strong></p>

<li>keep the home cool in the summer, warm in the winter.</li>
<li>decrease global warming effect</li>
<li>absorb 85% of rainfall</li>
<li>improves air quality-the plant material absorbs carbon dioxide and excess pollution from the atmosphere, and releases oxygen into the air.</li>
</ul>
<br/>    Our <strong>non-profit organization</strong> will include a fully sustainable bed and breakfast with 7 ""cobins.""  Guests will be able to visit the wolves in their sanctuary and experience their true nature firsthand. Workshops and seminars will be held for people to enjoy during their stay, with a wide range of topics including building with cob, soap and candle making, natural healing and herbalism, music instruction, martial arts, and more.  Eventually we hope to be able to travel to places in need and provide them with cob homes and shelters so they too may enjoy a fully self-sustainable lifestyle.<br/> <br/><strong>For the Artists</strong>~<br/>    The village will also be home to an artist 'cobstel', a cobin that will be available at low to no cost/barter to traveling artists of all kinds, shapes and sizes in need of a warm bed and a home-cooked meal.. It will sleep 8 people at a time so we are able to accomodate the needs of traveling groups or bands. <br/><br/>

<p>Your contribution to get this project off the ground is very important.

Hi my name is James Gibeson. I have a background in mechanical engineering and most recently as an entrepreneur. I’m currently living in Newport Beach where I’m starting my next venture.
Right now there is and island of trash twice the size of Texas floating in the Pacific. This mass of plastic and Styrofoam is responsible for killing thousands of marine animals like sea turtles and over a million birds every year. 
Project Harmony will raise awareness for the North Pacific Garbage Patch by turning an old delivery van into a mobile museum. While parked at the boardwalk, this mobile museum will educate the public about how trash makes its journey into the ocean. The mobile museum will be decked out (literally) so that people can walk inside and view displays on the first and second levels. While visiting the museum, people will be invited to a free concert, which takes place on the beach. Admission to the concert is simply to collect as much trash as possible from our polluted beaches.
The end result is that we will reach thousands of people, educate them and clean hundreds of miles of coastline.
Long-term funding for the mobile museum will come from donations and selling trash related artwork, clothing, and accessories from the museum store.
Project Harmony is an open source project- open to everyone! There will be ample opportunities for surfing, filmmaking, playing music, and more as we travel with the mobile museum. The more we can get the word out the better!
Your contribution to get this project off the ground is very important. With your help we can build a mobile museum that will educate thousands of people and clean over 114 miles of coastline in Southern California. Your contribution of $100, $60, or even $10 will make a positive impact on our environment. I personally welcome you into this exciting project and can’t wait to get started!!

What we need-
We already have the delivery van, so now it’s just matter of transforming it into a mobile museum.

This requires a structurally sound roof, railings, lower structural support, hydrologic leveling jacks, stairs, windows, flooring, museum displays, electrical generator, battery bank, inverter, converter, electronics for showing videos, speakers, and graphics for the outside to draw people in.
We also need to setup the museum store, stock it with clothing, accessories, and art work, build a website, and buy insurance.
You’d be surprised how fast everything adds up, but we can get it done with enough boot-strapping!
Other things we need:

A place to do the conversion near Newport Beach- Eg. shop, garage, parking lot with power and running water.
Used Fryer oil- The mobile museum already runs on this eco-friendly fuel! If you work at a restaurant or know someone who does, please find out if we can collect your used fryer oil. 
RV parts- leveling jacks, AC unit, heater, electrical generator, plumbing tanks, sinks, refrigerator.
Steel- pipes, poles, I-beams, sheets, etc.
Aluminum- pipes, poles, I-beams, sheets, etc.
Wood- plywood, 2X4's, etc.
Bamboo poles, bamboo matting, palm materials, etc.
Old bench seats from a restaurant or or upholstery supplies.
Golf cart batteries (for the battery bank)- Trojan T-105's preferred.
The use of certain tools- angle grinder, plasma cutter, welder (TIG and stick).
Volunteers; especially if you have certain skills:

Welding/fabrication
Carpentry
Graphic design
Filmmaking
Photography
Clothing design
Website design and coding
Making music/playing in a band
Surfing
Sunbathing
All skills welcome/everyone is welcome!

<h3>HELLO!</h3>
<p>my name is Alana Fitzgerald. I am a young artist living in NYC, still coming to terms with the fact that last fall a hurricane devastated large sections of our coastline. I was living in Rockaway Beach, NY at the time and watched from a friend's second floor window as the Beach and the Bay met one another, the flooding turned the streets to waterways and the town was literally turned upside down by the power of the enraged Atlantic Ocean. I like many others, lost my home in the disaster. It changed my life. However, there was an amazing silver lining. People came together to help one another in this intense and uneasy situation like I've never seen before. In new york city, such an event was unprecedented as far as anyone can remember. We were able to finally see first hand the impact that civilization has been making upon the earth, to understand how fragile the balance is between Man and Nature. Grateful in the aftermath to be alive and unharmed, I have made it my mission to spread awareness about how important it is to honor and protect our mother earth and her precious waters. There have been many disasters lately in the oceans which have been frightening, and I believe that prayer is a good way to align our consciousness towards positive change of the way we interact with our environment. </p>
<p> On October 18th, 2013, I plan to hold a water blessing ceremony in Rockaway Beach, NY. Essentially this is a prayer, inspired by Masaru Dr. Emoto's findings that water holds memory, intent and vibration. When we sing to the water, pray to the water, speak to the water- it is restructured, healed in a sense. It has a type of understanding that we are thankful, that we desire peace and good health. We have the power to transmit our spirit this way, put our loving hearts and good intentions out there into the ocean, and I believe that this effects the water of the entire planet in a positive way. </p>
<p>New York City is a diverse place full of rich cultural and spiritual traditions. I plan to celebrate this with a non-denominational earth based ceremony. I have invited Native American leaders and elders from the Lakota and Taino people to pray with me as well as my very good friend and NYC spiritual leader Shiva Singh. </p>
<p>This Water Blessing Ceremony will include an offering of flowers, wishes and food to the ocean, chants, drumming and songs and community prayers read aloud for all to hear. Afterwards we will celebrate with a feast at Veggie Island, a lovely beacon of local organic food and one of the centers of the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm. It should be a beautiful way to remember the hurricane and to offer peace and gratitude to our oceans, as well as love and healing to the community.</p>
<p>I am asking you if you will help me raise the money to do this. I need plane tickets for our out of town guests as well as food, transportation and housing, and materials for the offerings (we need tons of flowers!). I also would love to be able to cater this event and make it all happen in a comfortable and wonderful way. I am grateful for support of any kind. </p>
<p>Thank you so much. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We are creating an 30 minute film for family audiences. What you will see in this short 4-minute film is one scene from the storyline. We shot this short demo in order to give people a taste of our project. In the story, we began by asking the question  ""What would happen if an
eleven-year-old urban girl was forced to live in a remote cabin in
Northern Ontario with an eccentric aunt?  And what would happen if that
same aunt<font>–</font><font>
</font>a long time activist and a woman driven with worry for the
environment<font>–</font><font> </font> chose to live a garbage-free lifestyle?  Years ago, I visited a
friend of mine who lives in a small northern Ontario town, who had taken on that very task.  She had
reduced her garbage down to one, very small plastic bag a month. At the
time, we were so inspired by her dedication that I, along with composer
Lise Vaugeois and performer Jennifer Garrett, wrote and toured a
theatre piece, then titled “Under the Moon with Aunt Birdie”. 
(Incidentally, the chamber orchestra version of the story will be produced this season by the Thunder Bay
Symphony Orchestra).</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">During our performance
run, we invited filmmaker Sonja Obljubek, to film archival footage. 
She thought it would make a great premise for a film.  This
percolated in the back of my mind for years until one day, I picked
up my pen and wrote a film script, (not all in one day, naturally),
re-titling it “Under the Pearl Moon”. Once I could think and
create in a visual language, the story expanded to include
neighbours, a boy with a bit of a chip on his shoulders, a woman with
vision loss, and an ancient pine tree.  Out of necessity, this
eclectic group becomes Pearl's community.  And in the end, it is
Pearl who discovers a sense of wonder and awe in nature, thus
teaching her aunt how to return to that place of connection with the
natural world.  
</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Children, I fear, are
not always encouraged or given opportunities to develop connections
with the natural world.  It is one of our most basic human rights, I
believe; to have access to the natural world.  Only then will any of
us have the passion and desire to truly become responsible stewards
of our earth.  
</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">As this has been in
development for years, other components and community people have
become part of this project. Filmmaker Sonja Obljubek will co-direct
the piece with myself- Eleanor Albanese.   Lise Vaugeois will incorporate some of the
music she originally composed.  Eco Superior Thunder Bay has
contributed to the educational component of this project.  Thunder
Bay Art Gallery have stepped in as a partner. And Confederation College Film Program are offering donations-in-kind.  As well as producing
the film, environmental-arts lesson plans have been developed for
teachers to use in classrooms. An educational package and website will be made
available to teachers across the county and internationally.  And the film itself will
visit environmental film festivals worldwide.    
</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">It's a tall project
with a tall order. Our message, in a nutshell is, “remember to be
inspired in and with the natural world”. We have some core funding from arts councils and the City of Thunder Bay but we are
looking for individuals and businesses to become friends of this
project. With this additional funding in place, we will be able to fairly reimburse the production team and acting talent.  And we will be able to produce the high quality film we intend to offer our audiences.  Late this Fall, we will shoot the film. Over the winter and spring, we will edit it,
integrate original music, and finally send it out to delight and inspire family
audiences everywhere.  Will you invest in this vision? Ultimately, it
is our way of giving back to this extraordinary planet, and
encouraging stewardship for all.

not always encouraged or given opportunities to develop connections
with the natural world.  It is one of our most basic human rights, I
believe; to have access to the natural world.  Only then will any of
us have the passion and desire to truly become responsible stewards
of our earth.  


As this has been in
development for years, other components and community people have
become part of this project. Filmmaker Sonja Obljubek will co-direct
the piece with myself- Eleanor Albanese.   Lise Vaugeois will incorporate some of the
music she originally composed.  Eco Superior Thunder Bay has
contributed to the educational component of this project.  Thunder
Bay Art Gallery have stepped in as a partner. And Confederation College Film Program are offering donations-in-kind.  As well as producing
the film, environmental-arts lesson plans have been developed for
teachers to use in classrooms. An educational package and website will be made
available to teachers across the county and internationally.  And the film itself will
visit environmental film festivals worldwide.    


It's a tall project
with a tall order. Our message, in a nutshell is, “remember to be
inspired in and with the natural world”. We have some core funding from arts councils and the City of Thunder Bay but we are
looking for individuals and businesses to become friends of this
project. With this additional funding in place, we will be able to fairly reimburse the production team and acting talent.  And we will be able to produce the high quality film we intend to offer our audiences.  Late this Fall, we will shoot the film. Over the winter and spring, we will edit it,
integrate original music, and finally send it out to delight and inspire family
audiences everywhere.  Will you invest in this vision? Ultimately, it
is our way of giving back to this extraordinary planet, and
encouraging stewardship for all. 


Please help us get the word out so that we are able to reach our goal!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

cultivation of medicinal plants<b>. Currently, the centre hosts an unmatched

they have been trying hard to save the biodiversity in Kerala - and so far they
have accomplished substantial successes! But <b>Vanamoolika so far never
received appreciation or financial support from donors or governmental agencies</b>.</i></p><p></p>
<p><b>D</b>aher wurde es notwendig <b>aus Biodiversität Einkommen zu generieren</b>.
Um ihre Vision umzusetzen, wurde eine Manufaktur erbaut, in der die
Heilpflanzen zu Ayurvedischen Arzneimitteln, pflanzlichen Heilmitteln und
Kosmetik verarbeitet werden – biologisch und nach HACCP Standards. Diese Manufaktur
wird von 375 einheimischen Frauen betrieben – Vanamoolika, als gemeinnützige
Organisation – stellt die notwendigen Verarbeitungsanlagen zur Verfügung.</p>
<p><b>E</b>rst kürzlich konnten Handelspartnerschaften
mit deutschen Kleinunternehmen geschlossen werden, bei denen Kaffee und Gewürze
der Bauernorganisation ‚Organic Wayanad’ für den Export aufbereitet werden.</p>
<p><b>O</b>rganic Wayanad ist ein Kollektiv
von 350 lokalen Biobauern, die an Vanamoolika Gewürze wie z.B. Kardamom,
Pfeffer, Ingwer, Kurkuma, aber auch andere Nichtholz-Waldprodukte wie Kaffee,
Kakao, Cashew oder Kokosnüsse liefern. Die Verarbeitung und Verpackung dieser
Produkte stellt mittlerweile einen wichtigen wirtschaftlichen Baustein für
Vanamoolika dar.</p>
<p><b><i>T</i></b><i>he need grew to <b>turn
biodiversity into income</b>. To complete their vision, they have built a
manufacturing plant to process these plants into organic Ayurvedic medicine,
herbal medicine and cosmetics - all by organic, and HACCP international standards.
This factory belongs to 375 local women and Vanamoolika as
Non-Profit-Organisation provides them the facilities to run this enterprise.</i></p>
<p><b><i>R</i></b><i>ecently they have
successfully started establishing partnerships with small companies from Europe
for processing coffee and organic spices from their partners Organic Wayanad. Organic
Wayanad is a collective of some 350 local organic farmers that provide
Vanamoolika with a number of spices such as cardamom, pepper, ginger, turmeric
as well as non-wood-forest crops such as coffee, cocoa, cashew or coconut. The
processing and packing of these products meanwhile makes a substantial part of
Vanamoolika's income.</i></p>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><p></p><p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Warum ist die Arbeit von Vanamoolika so wichtig?</b></p>
<p><b>I</b>n Kerala wächst die Zahl der
Industriebetriebe, die Medizinalpflanzen ernten. Die meisten dieser Unternehmen
scheren sich nicht um Nachhaltigkeit oder die lokalen Gemeinschaften.
Wildsammlungen, die billiger sind als der Anbau, sind außer Kontrolle geraten.
Die natürliche Artenvielfalt ist gestört, was nicht nur zu einem rasanten Artenschwund
führt, sondern auch Qualität und Wirksamkeit der Heilmittel drastisch verringert.
</p>
<p>„Wenn wir der Wildsammlung nichts
entgegen setzen, werden alle Medizinalpflanzen über kurz oder lang verschwinden.
Denn wenn kein einziges Samenkorn mehr den Boden erreichen kann, wie soll dann
im nächsten Jahr eine neue Pflanze wachsen?“, fürchtet P.J. Chackochan,
Präsident von Vanamoolika.</p>
<p><b><i>Why is the work of Vanamoolika so important? </i></b></p>
<p><i><b>I</b>n Kerala the number of industries harvesting medicinal plants is
growing. Most of these businesses disregard all aspects of sustainability and
community. Wild harvesting of medicinal plants from the forests, which is
cheaper than their cultivation, is out of control. The result hurts natural
biodiversity and is leading to an alarming rapid decrease not only of species
and yield but also in quality of products.</i></p>
<p><i>‘<span>If we don't stop the wild
harvesting, all the medicinal plants are going to vanish. Because, if there is
not even a single seed left falling into the soil, how can there be a new plant
growing next year’? - President of Vanmoolika.</span></i></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">

<p><b>V</b>anamoolikas Menschen stehen vor großen
Herausfoderungen. Der nachhaltige und biologische Anbau bei Vanamoolikas ist
arbeitsintensiv, so dass die Produkte teurer sind als die der Wettbewerber.
Leider erfährt biologischer Landbau in Kerala wenig Wertschätzung und die
lokale Unterstützung ist gering, hauptsächlich aufgrund fehlenden Bewusstseins.
Die gute Botschaft ist, dass Vanamoolika langsam wächst, dafür aber Hilfe
braucht, um ein nachhaltiges Wachstum zu sichern, Hilfe, die sie unterstützen,
dass Investitionen, Wissen, Tradition und all die Energie und Mühen und die
Wurzeln, die das Projekt geschlagen hat, nicht zugrunde gehen.</p>
<p><b>Vanamoolika benötigt deine Unterstützung
um seine wirtschaftliche Basis zu stärken!</b> Deine Spende wird benötigt, um
Kreditraten und bessere Löhne zu bezahlen, Rohware anzukaufen und damit auch
Bauern und Indigene, die die Erzeuger der Rohwaren sind, eine sichere Existenz
zu bieten.</p>
<p><b>D</b>arüber hinaus möchten sie auch
ihr Ziel realisieren, ein kleines medizinisches Zentrum zu betreiben, in dem die
Gemeindemitglieder behandelt werden können.</p>
<p><b><i>T</i></b><i>here are many
challenges that Vanamoolika's people face. The sustainable and organic
production of Vanamoolika products is labour intensive and that makes our products
more expensive than those of their competitors. Unfortunately, organic farming
is still undervalued in Kerala and local support is very low, mostly due to
lack of awareness among the public. The good news is that Vanamoolika is
growing and needs help now to make sure that their growth is sustainable. They
need help to assure that the investment, knowledge, tradition, work and sweat,
the roots, which are already growing, will not die away.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Vanamoolika needs to raise money now to strengthen its financial basis!</i></b><i> Your support will be used to pay back loans, to purchase raw materials,
financially back the farmers and indigenous people in the region that are their

die Erhaltung und den biologischen Anbau von Medizinalpflanzen
Vanamoolika - centre for conservation and organic cultivation of
medicinal plants
Wir alle haben ein Ziel: Ein gesundes Leben!Dafür benötigen wir eine intakte Umwelt und einen nachhaltigen Lebensstil, der die  Natur und ihre Lebewesen nicht beeinträchtigt.Viele Bauern weltweit praktizieren biologische, nachhaltige Landwirtschaft und erhalten die Artenvielfalt - und sie tun das ganz selbstverständlich. Und eine wachsende Zahl von Verbraucher wissen dies zu schätzen, in dem sie ökologische Produkte kaufen, zu ihrem eigenem Wohle, dem der Natur und dem der Bauern. Dennoch ist die kleinbäuerliche Landwirtschaft weltweit bedroht durch die Agrar-Industrie. Sie versucht Kleinbauern, insbesondere in Entwicklungsländern aus den Märkten zu drängen.

We all want one thing: A Healthy
Life!
To have that, we are totally
dependent on nature. We have to live a sustainable lifestyle, a life that does
not harm nature or any living being.
Many small farmers around the
world practice organic farming, sustainable agriculture and biodiversity
conservation as a matter of course. A growing number of consumers support these
practices by buying their products for the benefit of nature, the producer, and
for themselves! Yet, organic local farming is under threat by agro-industries
intent on dominating the market and pushing out small farmers in developing
countries.
Kerala im Südwesten Indiens ist Teil der West-Ghats, einer der acht weltweit
wichtigsten UNESCO-Hotspots für Biodiversität. Dennoch können wir hier einen dramatischen Verlust an pflanzlicher und
tierischer Artenvielfalt beobachten – verursacht durch unkontrollierte Wildsammlungen,
Pestizidmissbrauch und Agrarindustrie mit großflächigen Monokulturen – eine fatale
Entwicklung nicht nur für die Natur, sondern auch für die Lebensgrundlage
zahlreicher Kleinbauern.
Aber eine kleine Organisation hier
in Kerala hat eine große Vision – eine Vision einer üppigen Natur für gesunde Lenensweise.
Diese Organisation trägt den klangvollen Namen ‚Vanamoolika’, was soviel
bedeutet wie ‚Heilpflanzen’. Vanamoolika hat sich bereits 1991 auf den Erhalt
und den biologischen Anbau von Medizinalpflanzen spezialisiert.
Kerala in Southwest India is part of the West-Ghat, one of the eight
most important UNESCO biodiversity hotspots in the world. Unsustainable wild harvesting and the use of pesticides in large-scale
mono-crop plantations are causing a massive loss of plant and animal
biodiversity - a dreadful development not only for nature but also a threat for
small farmers’ livelihoods.
But,
for one small organisation, here in Kerela there is a bigger vision– a vision
for a healthy life for humans and an abundant future for nature. This
organisation is Vanamoolika (which means medicinal plants)! Vanamoolika since 1991 has specialised
in the conservation and organic cultivation of medical plants.



In vielen Entwicklungsländern, insbesondere in ländlichen Regionen, ist ein
Großteil der Menschen für ihre medizinische Grundversorgung im Wesentlichen von
traditioneller Medizin abhängig. Dabei stehen in vielen Familien und Gemeinschaften
meist Frauen in der Verantwortung für Vorsorge und Heilung. Sie beziehen ihre
Rohstoffe für traditionelle Medizin direkt aus der Natur und spielen daher eine
zentrale Rolle als Hüterinnen traditionellen Wissens – und das ist es wofür
Vanamoolika steht.
In many developing countries a large part of the
population, especially in rural areas, depend mainly on traditional medicine
for their primary health care. Women are mostly responsible in keeping families
and their communities healthy by providing preventive and curative care. Traditional
medicinal plants play a central role in the resources that women draw upon.That
is why women play a crucial role as keepers of traditional knowledge and that
is what Vanamoolika also stands for.


Mitten im Herzen der wilden,
grünen West-Ghats hat Vanamoolika über die Jahre, Schritt für Schritt, ein
Zentrum für die Erhaltung von Medizinalpflanzen aufgebaut, 4 Acres Fläche, auf
denen wissbegierige Frauen und Männer alles
über die Erhaltung, den Anbau und die Wirkung von Medizinalpflanzen lernen
können. Derzeit beherbergen die Wälder und Gärten Vanamoolikas die unglaubliche
Zahl von über 700 Medizinalpflanzen – das Ergebnis von 23 Jahren harter Arbeit
und ein unschätzbarer Beitrag für die Artenvielfalt Kerala. Was für ein Erfolg!
Leider hat Vanamoolika für diesen Beitrag bisher keinerlei finanzielle Unterstützung oder Wertschätzung seitens
offizieller Stellen erhalten.
Situated in the very
middle of the wild green Western Ghats, Vanamoolika has been building over the
years, step by step, an approximately 4 acre centre for the conservation of
medicinal plans. Here they have created a training centre for people who are
interested in learning about organic farming and the conservation and
cultivation of medicinal plants. Currently, the centre hosts an unmatched
number of more than 700 medicinal plants. For the last twenty-three years
they have been trying hard to save the biodiversity in Kerala - and so far they
have accomplished substantial successes! But Vanamoolika so far never
received appreciation or financial support from donors or governmental agencies.
Daher wurde es notwendig aus Biodiversität Einkommen zu generieren.
Um ihre Vision umzusetzen, wurde eine Manufaktur erbaut, in der die
Heilpflanzen zu Ayurvedischen Arzneimitteln, pflanzlichen Heilmitteln und
Kosmetik verarbeitet werden – biologisch und nach HACCP Standards. Diese Manufaktur
wird von 375 einheimischen Frauen betrieben – Vanamoolika, als gemeinnützige
Organisation – stellt die notwendigen Verarbeitungsanlagen zur Verfügung.
Erst kürzlich konnten Handelspartnerschaften
mit deutschen Kleinunternehmen geschlossen werden, bei denen Kaffee und Gewürze
der Bauernorganisation ‚Organic Wayanad’ für den Export aufbereitet werden.
Organic Wayanad ist ein Kollektiv
von 350 lokalen Biobauern, die an Vanamoolika Gewürze wie z.B. Kardamom,
Pfeffer, Ingwer, Kurkuma, aber auch andere Nichtholz-Waldprodukte wie Kaffee,
Kakao, Cashew oder Kokosnüsse liefern. Die Verarbeitung und Verpackung dieser
Produkte stellt mittlerweile einen wichtigen wirtschaftlichen Baustein für
Vanamoolika dar.
The need grew to turn
biodiversity into income. To complete their vision, they have built a
manufacturing plant to process these plants into organic Ayurvedic medicine,
herbal medicine and cosmetics - all by organic, and HACCP international standards.
This factory belongs to 375 local women and Vanamoolika as
Non-Profit-Organisation provides them the facilities to run this enterprise.
Recently they have
successfully started establishing partnerships with small companies from Europe
for processing coffee and organic spices from their partners Organic Wayanad. Organic
Wayanad is a collective of some 350 local organic farmers that provide
Vanamoolika with a number of spices such as cardamom, pepper, ginger, turmeric
as well as non-wood-forest crops such as coffee, cocoa, cashew or coconut. The
processing and packing of these products meanwhile makes a substantial part of
Vanamoolika's income.

Warum ist die Arbeit von Vanamoolika so wichtig?
In Kerala wächst die Zahl der
Industriebetriebe, die Medizinalpflanzen ernten. Die meisten dieser Unternehmen
scheren sich nicht um Nachhaltigkeit oder die lokalen Gemeinschaften.
Wildsammlungen, die billiger sind als der Anbau, sind außer Kontrolle geraten.
Die natürliche Artenvielfalt ist gestört, was nicht nur zu einem rasanten Artenschwund
führt, sondern auch Qualität und Wirksamkeit der Heilmittel drastisch verringert.

„Wenn wir der Wildsammlung nichts
entgegen setzen, werden alle Medizinalpflanzen über kurz oder lang verschwinden.
Denn wenn kein einziges Samenkorn mehr den Boden erreichen kann, wie soll dann
im nächsten Jahr eine neue Pflanze wachsen?“, fürchtet P.J. Chackochan,
Präsident von Vanamoolika.
Why is the work of Vanamoolika so important? 
In Kerala the number of industries harvesting medicinal plants is
growing. Most of these businesses disregard all aspects of sustainability and
community. Wild harvesting of medicinal plants from the forests, which is
cheaper than their cultivation, is out of control. The result hurts natural
biodiversity and is leading to an alarming rapid decrease not only of species
and yield but also in quality of products.
‘If we don't stop the wild
harvesting, all the medicinal plants are going to vanish. Because, if there is
not even a single seed left falling into the soil, how can there be a new plant
growing next year’? - President of Vanmoolika.


Vanamoolikas Menschen stehen vor großen
Herausfoderungen. Der nachhaltige und biologische Anbau bei Vanamoolikas ist
arbeitsintensiv, so dass die Produkte teurer sind als die der Wettbewerber.
Leider erfährt biologischer Landbau in Kerala wenig Wertschätzung und die
lokale Unterstützung ist gering, hauptsächlich aufgrund fehlenden Bewusstseins.
Die gute Botschaft ist, dass Vanamoolika langsam wächst, dafür aber Hilfe
braucht, um ein nachhaltiges Wachstum zu sichern, Hilfe, die sie unterstützen,
dass Investitionen, Wissen, Tradition und all die Energie und Mühen und die
Wurzeln, die das Projekt geschlagen hat, nicht zugrunde gehen.
Vanamoolika benötigt deine Unterstützung
um seine wirtschaftliche Basis zu stärken! Deine Spende wird benötigt, um
Kreditraten und bessere Löhne zu bezahlen, Rohware anzukaufen und damit auch
Bauern und Indigene, die die Erzeuger der Rohwaren sind, eine sichere Existenz
zu bieten.
Darüber hinaus möchten sie auch
ihr Ziel realisieren, ein kleines medizinisches Zentrum zu betreiben, in dem die
Gemeindemitglieder behandelt werden können.
There are many
challenges that Vanamoolika's people face. The sustainable and organic
production of Vanamoolika products is labour intensive and that makes our products
more expensive than those of their competitors. Unfortunately, organic farming
is still undervalued in Kerala and local support is very low, mostly due to
lack of awareness among the public. The good news is that Vanamoolika is
growing and needs help now to make sure that their growth is sustainable. They
need help to assure that the investment, knowledge, tradition, work and sweat,
the roots, which are already growing, will not die away.
Vanamoolika needs to raise money now to strengthen its financial basis! Your support will be used to pay back loans, to purchase raw materials,
financially back the farmers and indigenous people in the region that are their
producers, and pay a better wage to their workers.
They are also going to
use this help toward our vision of building a small medical centre here in
Vanamoolika that will benefit the local community.

<p><strong>Our team needs YOUR help to produce a fold-out print map illustrating the Harbor Ring.</strong>  While our website <a href=""http://www.harborring.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">harborring.org</a> features the on-street route for everyone’s immediate use, the print map will showcase much, much more!  From transit connections, water sources, and restrooms to bike shops, cultural attractions, and restaurants, the official Harbor Ring map will allow visitors to make the most of their trip around the New York Bay and experience the charm of the local sights and tastes. </p>
<p>Once produced and printed, we can distribute complimentary maps to bike shops, local businesses, tourist destinations, and at events, so that visitors and locals alike can experience their city in a whole new way—for free.  The more people who use and enjoy the route, the more support can grow for a bicycle and pedestrian path over the Verrazano.</p>
<p>The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which connects Brooklyn to Staten Island, is restricted to those traveling on foot or by bicycle and is the “missing link” to a complete Harbor Ring.  Built in 1964, the Verrazano Bridge was initially designed with a pedestrian and bicycle path. While the path was never constructed, the bridge was ultimately engineered to accommodate one. In honor of the Verrazano’s upcoming 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2014, we’re advocating for the completion of the bridge, which will also allow for the completion the Harbor Ring.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>When finished, the Harbor Ring will not only offer unprecedented recreational opportunities, it will also continue to establish the region as one of the nation’s most bike-friendly, an honor now deeply coveted by cities around the world, and make it safer and easier than ever to get around the neighborhood and to work by bicycle.  </p>
<p>A recent survey showed that 84% of over 700 respondents believed that the presence of a bicycle/pedestrian path over the Verrazano Bridge would “strongly encourage” them to use a bicycle as transportation between Brooklyn and Staten Island, potentially easing congestion and facilitating access to a community with one of the longest commute times in the nation.</p>
<p>The Harbor Ring will also spur tourism in underserved neighborhoods around the region and will make the metropolitan area an even more attractive destination.  The Harbor Ring provides stunning views of the Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Jersey City Skyline, Statue of Liberty, the Verrazano Bridge, and Ellis Island, while reconnecting residents and visitors to New York and New Jersey’s spectacular waterfront and offering access to enjoy some of the region’s most historic landmarks, 48 parks, and regional destinations.</p>
<p>The route also includes numerous vibrant business districts, including DUMBO, the Columbia Street Waterfront, Bay Street, Ocean Avenue, and downtown Jersey City, downtown Hoboken, and Battery Park City.

<p>We are Eddie
and Kim McIntosh and our 2 year old daughter Eloise. We own, manage and run Mellowcroft
Natural Holistic Retreat. </p>
<p>Mellowcroft is an off–grid, low impact social enterprise in
Mid Wales on an ancient 12 acre smallholding.</p>
<p>Alongside horticulture we offer calming retreats for those
seeking to escape the hectic pace of modern life and reconnect with the
environment. We have community allotment space for individuals and local social
groups. </p>
<p>Every year we offer free respite retreats for around 40
teenagers from a local charity known as Powys Young Carers, as their name
suggests they are all full time carers for their own parents and siblings, they
rely upon their time with us to recharge their batteries and get the
opportunity to just be kids for a while.</p>
<p>We manage the land to encourage wildlife habitat and
biodiversity with a commitment to identifying, protecting and promoting native
species of flora and fauna. We work with the advice/support of the Woodland
Trust and Radnorshire Wildlife Association and have regular visits to record
the species on site and help it flourish. </p>
<p>Our management of the land has protected several ancient
species of insect, one of which appears in the ‘Red Book’.</p>
<p>We offer free space to ‘Local Roots’, a charity that runs Forest
schools for all ages, to run Mother &amp; Toddler and teenage ‘back to nature’
groups.</p>
<p>We have many volunteers from across the community, working
with the Job Centre and the ‘Volunteering on prescription’ service; this allows
often vulnerable adults in the community to gain work experience and develop
their self esteem. In addition to this we welcome Students from across the UK
on work placements and study trips, and offer Artist and Musician sabbaticals. We
also encourage local people who need facilities to get their own self
employment off the ground to discuss their needs with us. Mellowcroft offers a personally
tailored rate and where possible offers the space they need for free until they
can afford it.</p>
<p>As a Social Enterprise we are funded to offer this charity
and community support by ‘Friends of Mellowcroft’ members, retreat users from
all over the world and from small events held in the summers. The accommodation
offered for those retreats is humble consisting of a small number of reclaimed
timber and cedar cabins in shepherd hut style along with a classroom, and treehouse with communal kitchen and
lounge.</p>

<p>Internationally acclaimed Cedar Classroom in the Pine Woods with glorious views of the hillside<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mellowcroft offers access to alternative health facilities
and practitioners. We make use of the mineral rich natural spring water
abundant in the area by preserving the ‘Spa’ heritage of the area. </p>
<p>We welcome input from those with an interest and experience
in renewable energy and sustainable practise so that we can be guided to
achieve the best possible future for the project.</p>
<p>Mellowcroft does not claim any grants or farming subsidies
for the land as we do not believe it is a sustainable way to farm or protect
the environment. We are the embodiment of all the European, National, Welsh
Assembly and Local Council guidelines for sustainable development and farm
diversification – We are ticking every box.</p>
<p>Since buying the smallholding in 2006 we’ve welcomed regular
visits from a Planning Officer who noted the improvements and modest changes we
were making to what was a derelict smallholding, and encouraged us with his
comments. In the absence of any advice or formal notification to the contrary -
we believed we were working within planning law, surely we would have been told
if we were not. </p>
<p><b>So what’s the problem?</b></p>
<p><b>We are currently being driven out by our County Council with
behaviour that has already been deemed “unreasonable” by the Planning
Inspectorate.<br/></b></p>
<p>It seems we were misled over a period of 8 years by the Council
as in December 2013 came the 1st Enforcement Notice.</p>
<p>That was it
- no prior warning, no letter or phone call to discuss any issues or concerns –
just the Enforcement Notice formally accusing us of criminal development and
giving just 9 months to demolish everything and get off the land.<span>  What was worse, no-one was available to meet
in the Council office till mid-January, which gave us just three days to make
an Appeal before the deadline to do so would expire. </span></p>
<p>We pleaded for time to submit a planning application so that
the council could ‘regulate’ the site but were refused. Instead - we were
advised that ‘perhaps, if we claimed to be travellers, we could avoid eviction”!</p>
<p>Our appeal to the Planning Inspectorate resulted in our case
being scheduled for a Public Inquiry in October 2014 however, just two weeks
before we would have the chance to have our say – The County Council withdrew
the Enforcement notice and cancelled the Inquiry. The Welsh Assembly granted us
a partial award of costs – which the County Council is ‘vigorously’ opposing
despite it being conceded ‘that it was not expedient to serve the Enforcement
Notice in the first instance’.</p>
<p>You would think then that we were safe – you couldn’t be
more wrong!</p>
<p>Despite taking the first opportunity to submit a full and,
if we do say so ourselves, an impressive planning application the County
Council have Enforced against us again, Twice! Both served on the same date in spite
of having our application in their hands at the time. </p>
<p>In fact it’s the same Planning officer that got the previous
Enforcement so very ‘wrong’ that has served the 2 new Enforcements! They are
also the very same person who is assessing, in a supposedly unbiased way, our planning
application – a complete conflict of interest if ever there was one. </p>
<p>Further to this, the very same planning officer arrived unannounced
at Mellowcroft just a few weeks ago to assess our planning application and
brought a Police escort – we feel strongly that this was a stunt to tarnish
Mellowcroft’s reputation. </p>
<p>This same planning officer demanded a ‘Great Crested Newt’
survey for our planning application; warning us of a potential prison sentence if
we so much a shone a torch on the wildlife pool, whilst simultaneously
demanding that we fill in the same pools in the Enforcement Notices!</p>
<p>So you can see that the unreasonable behaviour highlighted
by the Planning Inspectorate and The Welsh Assembly has not abated.</p>
<p></p>

<b></b>
<p>A tiny new resident of the Wildlife pool </p>
<p></p>
<p>We have tried to discuss our planning application
with the Planning Dept, like any other applicant who pays for this service from their
council. We are told time and again that we can have that opportunity in our appeal!
They show no respect for the democratic process of the public planning committee
which should decide our planning application. They have frequently exploited their power and we can only assume that with egg on their face from the
previous farce that this is a personal grudge they will not let go.</p>
<p>At no point have we tried to deceive the Planners, or hide
any of the work at Mellowcroft. We have welcomed our neighbours, local
community and the world to get involved with the project and this welcome has
been extended to us in return. Our local community and district council
recently voted to approve our planning application due to huge local support
and our commitment to the social, environmental and economic benefits.</p>
<p>We were advised, after a meeting to discuss our concerns with
Powys Chief Executive, that if a formal planning application to regularise
existing development was made “it is likely that the council will not oppose
such a measure where an appropriate planning application is submitted”. It would
appear from this advice that he was unaware of the intentions of his own Planning officer. </p>
<p><b>What’s the situation now?</b></p>
<p>Despite our best efforts to submit an appropriate planning
application we have now been served a further two enforcement notices which are
currently held in abeyance by the Planning Inspectorate until the application
has been decided upon. As the aforementioned Council planning officer has
constantly alluded to the imminent refusal of our application we are preparing
for another Public Inquiry.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431185513/csxbugrunh3gdtxpxq2t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Orchids now flourish in our wildlife meadows<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What’s needed?</b></p>
<p>Quite frankly - we need financial support to save
‘Mellowcroft’ and the tireless work that is done here to protect the natural
world and our community for generations to come.  Our project has suffered greatly under the threat
of demolishment and it’s a battle which we have poured our heart and soul into.
</p>
<p>Whilst the help we have had so far has been invaluable in
keeping us in the fight; it is now time to hire a legal professional to
represent us and bring this desperate affair to a sensible conclusion for us
and our community; who are devastated by the impending loss of the valuable
asset we provide.</p>
<p>If we are to have any hope of success; we need to raise enough
money to hire a suitable Barrister to present our case, expose the council’s abuse
of power and the factual error in their action against us.  </p>
<p>The council have made it clear in email correspondence that
they do not respect our opinions, evidence or arguments as they do not believe
we are ‘qualified’ to question them, hence the need for professional
representation.</p>
<p>Extensive inquiries have shown that something in the region of £15,000 will be needed to
hire a Barrister with the qualities and experience to take the case on. They will need to be able to see
through the complex maze of evidence, planning policy and legislation.<br/>
<br/>
Added to this, we estimate £5000 will see us through while we try to
balance running Mellowcroft at the same time as this incredibly trying legal
battle. £5000 will pay for 400 man-hours and travel costs for 4 key staff
members. With this extra support we can maintain the important service
we provide for the charities, volunteers and community in the midst of
these nightmarish circumstances.

brought a Police escort – we feel strongly that this was a stunt to tarnish
Mellowcroft’s reputation. 
This same planning officer demanded a ‘Great Crested Newt’
survey for our planning application; warning us of a potential prison sentence if
we so much a shone a torch on the wildlife pool, whilst simultaneously
demanding that we fill in the same pools in the Enforcement Notices!
So you can see that the unreasonable behaviour highlighted
by the Planning Inspectorate and The Welsh Assembly has not abated.




A tiny new resident of the Wildlife pool 

We have tried to discuss our planning application
with the Planning Dept, like any other applicant who pays for this service from their
council. We are told time and again that we can have that opportunity in our appeal!
They show no respect for the democratic process of the public planning committee
which should decide our planning application. They have frequently exploited their power and we can only assume that with egg on their face from the
previous farce that this is a personal grudge they will not let go.
At no point have we tried to deceive the Planners, or hide
any of the work at Mellowcroft. We have welcomed our neighbours, local
community and the world to get involved with the project and this welcome has
been extended to us in return. Our local community and district council
recently voted to approve our planning application due to huge local support
and our commitment to the social, environmental and economic benefits.
We were advised, after a meeting to discuss our concerns with
Powys Chief Executive, that if a formal planning application to regularise
existing development was made “it is likely that the council will not oppose
such a measure where an appropriate planning application is submitted”. It would
appear from this advice that he was unaware of the intentions of his own Planning officer. 
What’s the situation now?
Despite our best efforts to submit an appropriate planning
application we have now been served a further two enforcement notices which are
currently held in abeyance by the Planning Inspectorate until the application
has been decided upon. As the aforementioned Council planning officer has
constantly alluded to the imminent refusal of our application we are preparing
for another Public Inquiry.


Orchids now flourish in our wildlife meadows

What’s needed?
Quite frankly - we need financial support to save
‘Mellowcroft’ and the tireless work that is done here to protect the natural
world and our community for generations to come.  Our project has suffered greatly under the threat
of demolishment and it’s a battle which we have poured our heart and soul into.

Whilst the help we have had so far has been invaluable in
keeping us in the fight; it is now time to hire a legal professional to
represent us and bring this desperate affair to a sensible conclusion for us
and our community; who are devastated by the impending loss of the valuable
asset we provide.
If we are to have any hope of success; we need to raise enough
money to hire a suitable Barrister to present our case, expose the council’s abuse
of power and the factual error in their action against us.  
The council have made it clear in email correspondence that
they do not respect our opinions, evidence or arguments as they do not believe
we are ‘qualified’ to question them, hence the need for professional
representation.
Extensive inquiries have shown that something in the region of £15,000 will be needed to
hire a Barrister with the qualities and experience to take the case on. They will need to be able to see
through the complex maze of evidence, planning policy and legislation.

Added to this, we estimate £5000 will see us through while we try to
balance running Mellowcroft at the same time as this incredibly trying legal
battle. £5000 will pay for 400 man-hours and travel costs for 4 key staff
members. With this extra support we can maintain the important service
we provide for the charities, volunteers and community in the midst of
these nightmarish circumstances. 



How
can you help?
By
donating to this crowd funding appeal: 
You
will help us to protect the valuable heritage of this ancient smallholding and
enable us to continue to support our community through Mellowcroft’s social
enterprise promise.
You
will help us to prove that sensitive, sustainable businesses can exist in
harmony with the natural environment while improving the social & economic
viability of small rural communities.
You
will help to protect the vulnerable biodiversity and the natural landscape for
generations to come.
You
will help us to protect the land for use by local charities, volunteers and
community groups, and to continue promoting Off-grid low–impact lifestyles
and permaculture.
You
will help to preserve the opportunity for anyone who feels the need
to retreat from the modern world and reconnect with a simpler, more wholesome
way of life. Here, they can do so in a safe, natural and holistic environment and at an
affordable rate.
Please
give what you can to help our cause – we fight not just for ourselves and our
home but for a project that is genuinely beneficial to many.
Every
penny counts so please pledge something – County Councils should be held to
account when they take liberties with their authority over the public – this is
the chance for you to get involved in doing just that.
Isolated
we are vulnerable – together we are strong.

Our promise to you
We promise to use the funds for the purposes of hiring a
Barrister and additional staff to fight the Planning Authorities ill-conceived
course of action
We promise to publish receipts for every penny spent and
that any funds left over after this defence will be donated to Powys Young
Carers and Local Roots ‘forest school’, the two charities that Mellowcroft
actively supports at present. 
We promise to publish all documentation associated with the
Planning Application and Enforcement Appeal and ensure that the process and
outcome are accessible to as many as possible. 
We promise to publish the date, time and venue for the
Public Inquiry.  We aim to accommodate those
who travel to support us from further afield.
We promise to stream the public Inquiry for those who cannot
attend ‘LIVE’ on the internet and publish the link on our website and social
media pages.
We promise to continue our commitment to sustainable,
environmentally sensitive land management; recognising the centuries of back
breaking input from generations of smallholders.
We promise to make it our mission to get government
recognition of the need to protect all historical small-holdings by way of
‘section 106 agreements’ to safeguard our cultural heritage. This will allow ordinary
people, through appropriate diversification, to secure the economic viability
of the land and rebuild their local rural communities for many centuries to
come.
We are already in dialogue with the Welsh Assembly about the
effect of inflexible planning departments on the economic regeneration and
overall future of rural communities. 
We aim to promote an online network of rural communities,
towns and villages to enable the sharing information and strategy to change
things for the better - for the future.

We got involve almost without realizing it, and scarce resources, in a short production of bags. We have marketed it in Spain through our website and peoples' reaction has been amazing. However, we believe there are things to improve in the manufacturing process in order to make it more competitive and professional. In this first stages we have done some things on a ""craftsmanship level"". It's time to professionalize production if we want to reach everyone. If we don't think big we run into the risk of leaving this project on just a good idea.<br/>

We all want to do the right thing, and sometimes those are the littlest things! Just think about the water that we waste every day while we wait for the shower to get hot. The average amount wasted is between 3 and 6 liters. Multiply that over everyone and we’re wasting millions of liters of fresh, clean water every day! We want to create a community of water savers.And it all starts with this simple, elegant idea that lets us repurpose that water in all kinds of great ways.




You’ll love your water tote. It captures the cold water while you wait for your shower to get hot. You can then re-use it to water the plans, refill your pet’s water bowl, clean. (Even flush!) It’s also a handy, foldable garden sprinkler. It’s easy to use, and when you don’t need it it folds up nice and compact.



(1) Hang your tote in the shower. (2) Put your flexible shower head into the bag. (3) Fill the bag with the cold water that comes from the shower while you wait for it to heat. When the water’s hot, shut the tap and you’re ready for your shower. (4) You’ve just saved around 3 liters of water — ready for you to use later in the day!










Take the hose with one hand and the handle with the other hand, tip the bag and pour water making swirl. Save 3 liters from bag plus 6 liters from flush.

One hand holds the spout, while the other holds the main handle. Tilt it and you’re watering plants. It’s easy!

We’re pretty sure your dog will love it, too.

A great excuse to start your veggie patch!

You can also use your recaptured water for cleaning around the house.

One bag, one smile!






Use the water when you need it.






On/off.
Fasten the hose.
Flush!







The material used to produce this tote is TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane). It is a top plastic material with qualities like high resilience, good compression set, plus resistance to impacts, abrasions, high level of elasticity, elongation. It’s probably the best plastic material that we found in order to get a long life cycle. Also meets FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requeriments for EEUU.
It’s flexible…
And puncture resistant.

We are eighth graders at Prairie Crossing Charter School (PCCS) and we are working on our Culminating Project (CP). CP is a two year project that encompasses service learning as well as community service and has a positive impact on the environment.  For our project, we chose to install a bioswale and rain garden at our school to restore wetland habitats, provide clean and safe water for plants and animals, and solve an ongoing erosion problem at our school. Your donations will not only help us complete our project but also create a positive impact on the environment, helping us restore our beloved earth one step at a time. </p><h3>What is a Culminating Project?</h3><div>A Culminating Project or CP is a two year project at PCCS that is started in seventh grade and continued into eighth grade. However, it is in no way like any other school project. CP encourages student to interact with the environment and take notice of their surroundings. CP's main focus is for students to find a local issue they believe need resolving and work towards resolving that issue. PCCS is a very unique school because it has an environmental focus. From kindergarten, students work on service learning projects and continue until they graduate. PCCS's mission is to transform children through academic discovery and interaction with unique natural,ecological, and community resources. CP is a way for students to help better the environment while advancing their own knowledge of the world. </div><h3><b>What is a bioswale and rain garden?</b></h3><div>A bioswale is a natural storm water filtration system. It functions like a colander, trapping the dirt and debris at the top and letting the safe water run through. A bioswale uses vegetation and soil to filter water and gets rid of all contaminants providing a safe environment not only for plants and animal but also for us; humans. Bioswales differ in size, slope, velocity etc. Our bioswale will be an average size, around five feet long and wide and a maximum of 2 ft deep. It will be attached to a rain garden(s). </div><div>A rain garden is very similar to a bioswale. It often looks like a very beautiful garden but possess certain features a regular garden does not. A rain garden is usually near a source of water runoff and serves its purpose by slowing down the momentum of storm water runoff. It also gives the storm water more time to insinuate into the ground. This stops or slows down erosion from occurring and provides a  safer environment for native plants and animals. </div><h3>How will this project make a positive impact on the environment?</h3><div>At our school, there has been an ongoing erosion problem that seems to get worse every year. All the turf and vegetation on the landscape die, creating a problem for the organisms that use the landscape as their habit.  Erosion is the process by which the surface of the Earth is disrupted or worn away by water, glaciers, winds, and waves. The downward sloping of the landscape at our school caused water runoff to clot in one area and create a large problem that led to erosion and finally, the death of the organisms surrounding it. Our project will fix this problem by leveling out the land and providing a proper filtration system that will allow the water to flow through the soil providing plants and animals with a healthy environment. Not only will this erosion problem be fixed but also the habitats which were destroyed will be mended. This will help the environment by providing a cleaner community that organisms will be able to thrive in and restoring part of the food chain that is disturbed due to habitat loss.</div><h3>What we need </h3><div>We need approximately $1000. One of the reasons for the erosion problem is the soil. It is very clay-like and hard; not good for plants at all. We need to level out the ground completely and put in new soil as well as sand, because it will help the clean water flow smoothly and reach the roots of plants. We want to make our project as sustainable as possible, meaning we want to impact the society, economy, and environment.

We are eighth graders at Prairie Crossing Charter School (PCCS) and we are working on our Culminating Project (CP). CP is a two year project that encompasses service learning as well as community service and has a positive impact on the environment.  For our project, we chose to install a bioswale and rain garden at our school to restore wetland habitats, provide clean and safe water for plants and animals, and solve an ongoing erosion problem at our school. Your donations will not only help us complete our project but also create a positive impact on the environment, helping us restore our beloved earth one step at a time. What is a Culminating Project?A Culminating Project or CP is a two year project at PCCS that is started in seventh grade and continued into eighth grade. However, it is in no way like any other school project. CP encourages student to interact with the environment and take notice of their surroundings. CP's main focus is for students to find a local issue they believe need resolving and work towards resolving that issue. PCCS is a very unique school because it has an environmental focus. From kindergarten, students work on service learning projects and continue until they graduate. PCCS's mission is to transform children through academic discovery and interaction with unique natural,ecological, and community resources. CP is a way for students to help better the environment while advancing their own knowledge of the world. What is a bioswale and rain garden?A bioswale is a natural storm water filtration system. It functions like a colander, trapping the dirt and debris at the top and letting the safe water run through. A bioswale uses vegetation and soil to filter water and gets rid of all contaminants providing a safe environment not only for plants and animal but also for us; humans. Bioswales differ in size, slope, velocity etc. Our bioswale will be an average size, around five feet long and wide and a maximum of 2 ft deep. It will be attached to a rain garden(s). A rain garden is very similar to a bioswale. It often looks like a very beautiful garden but possess certain features a regular garden does not. A rain garden is usually near a source of water runoff and serves its purpose by slowing down the momentum of storm water runoff. It also gives the storm water more time to insinuate into the ground. This stops or slows down erosion from occurring and provides a  safer environment for native plants and animals. How will this project make a positive impact on the environment?At our school, there has been an ongoing erosion problem that seems to get worse every year. All the turf and vegetation on the landscape die, creating a problem for the organisms that use the landscape as their habit.  Erosion is the process by which the surface of the Earth is disrupted or worn away by water, glaciers, winds, and waves. The downward sloping of the landscape at our school caused water runoff to clot in one area and create a large problem that led to erosion and finally, the death of the organisms surrounding it. Our project will fix this problem by leveling out the land and providing a proper filtration system that will allow the water to flow through the soil providing plants and animals with a healthy environment. Not only will this erosion problem be fixed but also the habitats which were destroyed will be mended. This will help the environment by providing a cleaner community that organisms will be able to thrive in and restoring part of the food chain that is disturbed due to habitat loss.What we need We need approximately $1000. One of the reasons for the erosion problem is the soil. It is very clay-like and hard; not good for plants at all. We need to level out the ground completely and put in new soil as well as sand, because it will help the clean water flow smoothly and reach the roots of plants. We want to make our project as sustainable as possible, meaning we want to impact the society, economy, and environment. To effect the society, we need to not only educate them on our project and solve this problem but make it aesthetically appealing. To do this we need plants! This will be a native rain garden and bioswale, so we will be buying native plants. We want to make our rain garden and bioswale as beautiful as possible so we want to include all kinds of plants of all kinds of colors and different blooming seasons so it will be as beautiful as it can be. We could also use the money to by necessary tools to install this bioswale (i.e. perforated pipes, shovels, small rocks to help filter water). If we end up having any extra money, depending on how much we have, we will either make more rain gardens and bioswales in different places to educate communities or improve the first one we make as much as possible.If we do not reach our goal, we will take the money we have earned and make a bioswale and rain garden to the best of pour ability.

<p>We are trying to help prevent the major global catastrophes that would destroy human civilization. Yes, you heard that right. That’s really what we’re doing. And we’re pretty good at it too, if we may say so. We just need some funds to complete a new important project. </p>
<p>Right now we’re working on threats from emerging technologies like bioengineering, nanotechnology, geoengineering, and artificial intelligence. These technologies could bring awesome benefits to humanity, or they could bring great harm because of unintended consequences or even intentional misuse. For example, geoengineering could mitigate climate change and thus diminish extreme weather events like the devastating Hurricane Sandy; however the very same geoengineering technologies could have unforeseen and dangerous effects on the climate. Understanding how international laws can control such risk-tradeoffs is essential if we are to safely tackle mankind’s greatest challenges.</p>
<p>Because these technologies pose global risks, they require global solutions. It’s not enough for one country to regulate the technologies. A technological disaster in just one country could threaten us all. So if humanity is going to keep these technologies in check, we need international treaties. The problem is, the existing international treaties cover at most only a small portion of these threats.</p>
<p>That’s where we come in. With your kind support, we will research and write a paper on international treaties to prevent catastrophes from emerging technologies. We’ll submit the paper for publication in a law journal and also post it online. With enough funding (see stretch goals below) we’ll write more papers and create additional resources on the topic.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR RESEARCH PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>We’re going to come up with new ideas for how international treaties can prevent global catastrophes from emerging technologies. In formal terms, our study will assess what obligations a treaty could impose upon countries to reduce global catastrophic risk from emerging technologies. So for example, if you want to release a potentially dangerous bioengineered organism into the environment, then you will have to comply with the terms of the treaty to do so – assuming your country implemented the treaty, of course.</p>
<p>Along the way we’ll also consider how to balance complex factors such as cost-benefit analysis, society’s moral values, and risk tradeoffs with other global catastrophic risks. We will also address potential difficulties related to whether countries have the political will to agree an emerging technologies treaty, as well as how to enforce such a treaty and monitor compliance. These are important issues that can make a real difference both in international treaties and in the catastrophes themselves.</p>
<p>Our research will be a resource to help the international community protect everyone from emerging technology disasters. The research will serve as a tool to educate academics, policymakers, and the public. This sort of research is very important to help shape the global debate and reduce the chances of a global catastrophe occurring. And with President Obama just reelected, the time is now to come up with innovative ideas for his administration to implement to reduce global catastrophic risks before emerging technologies get out of hand.</p>
<p>Our primary goal is to write a paper to be published in an international law journal. This will reach the community of scholars who study international treaties. We will also post the paper online so that it is freely available to everyone. We plan on this paper being the first of many, so we have a strong incentive to deliver something that will make a huge impact. See our stretch goals below to see how this Indiegogo campaign can result in multiple papers. </p>

<p><strong>WHY WE'RE ON INDIEGOGO</strong></p>
<p>We’re excited to work with the Indiegogo community on this project. We believe it’s important to everyone to get involved in global threats, not just the usual academics and government officials. We want to connect with people who are interested in helping humanity confront its major threats. Our own work will continue beyond this emerging technologies project. We’re eager to help build an ongoing community of people who will stay active, too.</p>

<p><strong>FLEXIBLE FUNDING</strong></p>
<p>This campaign has flexible funding, meaning that we will still get funded even if we receive less than $8,000. If we receive less, then we will put the funds towards our ongoing research on international treaties for emerging technologies. We will also write some sort of paper, but it might be a shorter type of paper (like for a newspaper or magazine).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>STRETCH GOALS</strong></p>
<p><strong>$8,000:</strong> We write one paper, for submission to a law journal. This paper will reach legal scholars and in turn influence legal discussions about an international treaty.</p>
<p><strong>$13,000:</strong> We write a second paper, for submission to a risk analysis journal. This paper will extend the first paper to reach the community of risk analysts. Risk analysts are people who can really understand the risks that emerging technologies pose and are often in a position to advise governments on the risks.</p>
<p><strong>$15,000:</strong> We will also write a “citizen’s toolkit” for global catastrophic risks from emerging technologies. The toolkit will provide U.S. citizens with resources at the national and international levels for preventing global catastrophic risks. For example, the toolkit would include practical tips on what government resources are available to protect them from catastrophes. The toolkit would also give citizens practical tips to advocate for legal reform in areas related to global catastrophic risks. </p>
<p><strong>$20,000:</strong> We will create a three-part online lecture series on global catastrophic risks from emerging technologies. A series of experts will explore global catastrophic risks, especially from emerging technologies, followed by a Q&amp;A. </p>

Het langer openhouden van kerncentrale Borssele is een experiment; er is geen enkele ervaring met het zo lang openhouden van vergelijkbare centrales. Wij bij Laka willen niet het risico lopen dat we later aan onze kinderen moeten bekennen dat we nu niet alles hebben geprobeerd om dit dwaze besluit te voorkomen. U toch ook niet?De deadline voor het indienen van een bezwaar bij de Raad van State is 1 mei 2013.Als u Laka ondersteunt of eerder een zienswijze heeft ingediend, houden wij u via email op de hoogte over het verloop van de procedure.Als u zelf een procedure wilt aanspannen en u niet te ver van Borssele woont (anders bent u juridisch namelijk geen belanghebbende), neem dan contact met ons op.Als u inhoudelijk mee wilt werken aan de procedure, en u bijvoorbeeld enige bestuursrechtelijke ervaring heeft, kunt u uiteraard ook met ons contact opnemen.
Greenpeace en GroenLinks Zeeland gaan ook procederen bij de Raad van State. U kunt hen natuurlijk ook steunen.

ABOUT AJAX
·      
The Interior Medical Health Officer
who initially reviewed the Ajax mining proposal viewed it to be unsafe and
believed it should not proceed further in the application process:
“ The proposed Ajax Kamloops open pit mine is ill
conceived and poorly situated, and therefore unsafe, and would represent…a
serious public health hazard for the city and peoples of Kamloops.  …the EAO should therefore be ordered to
stop the review process for the proposal and remove it from further
consideration”.    Despite this warning, the Ajax proposal
proceeded through the preliminary assessment process.  Citizens will now have to battle the mining company and its
vast resources at the stage of formal application to try to stop Ajax.  
·      
The mine would be located as
close as 2 km. from an elementary
school and in close proximity to existing residences and a seniors’ care
facility.
·      
The City is downwind and downstream of the proposed
mine.  Prevailing winds would take
toxic emissions into the valley where people live and where it will sometimes
be trapped for days in inversions.
·      
The proposed wet tailings storage
of toxic wastes would be located in the watershed of Peterson Creek.  This creek flows through the heart of
the city and into the Thompson River , route of a world famous salmon run.   Any waste from a breach or failure of the tailings dam   (580 ft. high at one point) would potentially affect both people
and the Adams River salmon run.
·      
 The mine footprint would exceed 25 square kilometers, much of it endangered grasslands.  Plans are afoot to extend the mining
operation to the northeast, bringing 
mining activity even closer into the City and increasing the footprint
and the volume of toxic wastes produced.
·      
The area of the City closest to
the proposed mine has unstable soil and

the tailings facility on glacial till was reported to be a major cause of the
Mt. Polley tailings dam failure. 
Glacial till is also present in the proposed Ajax mine footprint in
Kamloops, increasing the risk of slides and tailings dam breaches.

Ajax mine operations would take
approximately 12.2 billion litres of
water annually from Kamloops Lake and our semi arid environment.  Volumes could increase to a capacity 14.6 billion litre drawdown
annually.  
 
WHO IS GOLIATH?
The parent company proposing the Ajax mine
is among the largest mining companies in the world and is 32% owned by the Polish
government.    It has
assets of billions of dollars.  The
past history of this international mining giant includes:
·      
A reported rating by “Greenbiz”
as one of the very worst carbon
polluters in Europe.

dangerous, especially when the potential cost is our health and damage to key
elements of the environment.   We have to take a stand.  We hope you can stand with us through your donation.

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
Ajax has not been approved YET.  A formal application is expected very
soon for assessment.  We must be

We urgently need to hire independent experts
who can critique the many thousands of pages of the mining application to

</p><p><b><i>The Amazon River is the biggest and longest undammed river <u>in
the world</u>,</i></b>
has an average discharge greater than the next 13 longest rivers combined, and
the greatest number of species. Peru’s
government has <b>plans to construct more
than 20 hydroelectric dams on the 1,056-mile pristine free-flowing Marañón
River, dubbed the Grand Canyon of the Amazon</b>. This invaluable resource begins
in the Peruvian Andes and is the upper source of the Amazon River. The energy will be exported to power mines owned
by corrupt trans-national corporations (google “petrobas scandal dams” for info).
Even if the purpose of the dams wasn’t singular and the dams actually provided
benefits to Peruvian people (which they don’t!), the Rio Maranon dams, combined
with other dams being constructed on Amazon River tributaries, is predicted to
lead to Amazon ecosystem collapse.</p>

This
summer I am volunteering for <b><a href=""http://paddlingwithpurpose.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paddling With Purpose</a></b> and the Peruvian NGO <strong><a href=""http://www.conservamospornaturaleza.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Conservamos por Naturaleza</a> </strong>(we conserve nature) in an effort to prevent the
Upper Amazon from being dammed. Please support this effort through donations on
this site.  <b>Funds raised will directly go towards the campaign costs to save the Upper Amazon.</b> I sincerely believe in this effort and I hope you can see the value in this project and lend support.
Thanks so much! <p>
</p><p><b>Who is PwP?</b>
We are volunteer scientists, engineers,
photographers, film producers, river rafting guides, whitewater kayakers, and
are all bonafide lovers of nature, people, animals and pure happiness.  <b><i>We have come together in a grassroots effort
to inform, educate, broadly publicize, and incite a nation to protect their
future and livelihoods.</i></b> We are tired of knowing, watching, and not
acting while the world sickens around us!! We care about our children, and we
care about creating a better tomorrow. 
Our long-term outlook: <i>Nothing is
more important for a healthy economy and people than living rivers that provide
free reproducing ecosystem services and thriving happy communities</i>. Sure, energy
is necessary, but there are smarter alternatives to dams in 2015. </p>
<p>We are creating solutions
instead of enabling problems.</p>
<p><b>What
is PwP doing and What Does Your Support Enable?</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Film
documentation, screenings, and a media blitz showing the resources and indigenous
communities along the Grand Canyon of the Amazon that will be lost (resources)

<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>A
massive effort to create media publicity with the end goal of (A) educating the

<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The
potential to stop dam reservoirs from being created, the creation of which
would dramatically increase release of methane gases and global warming. This

<br/><h3>The Issue:</h3>The
Upper Amazon River is under threat of being dammed and needs your help to
prevent its senseless destruction. Please help us in our efforts to stop the
dams. We <span>believe that the mainstem source
of the Amazon (Rio Marañon), the communities and ecosystems it supports are too
important to lose.<br/><br/></span><strong><span> </span></strong>
<p><strong><a href=""http://paddlingwithpurpose.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paddling with Purpose</a><span> </span></strong><span>and the Peruvian NGO</span><strong><span> </span><a href=""http://www.conservamospornaturaleza.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Conservamos por Naturaleza</a> </strong> have joined forces in creating a series of conservation
projects at local, national and international levels to show why the source of
the Amazon is more valuable in it’s free flowing state than stagnating behind a
series of mega-dams. </p>
<p>Basically,
one hydro dam is planned after another for the entire length of the river in
the Andes, leaving little or no free-flowing river. This will disrupt the largest
hydrological source of the Amazon, drastically alter normal silt deposition
into the  Amazon river basin, destroy habitat and migration patterns
for fish and other aquatic life, displace thousands of residents along the
river, submerge ancient pre-Incan ruins, and destroy a national treasure on par
with the Grand Canyon in the USA!</p>
<p>The
Río Marañon is the hydrological source of the Amazon and therefore deserves the
title of Upper Amazon. It is also perhaps <b><a href=""http://www.canoekayak.com/photos/rio-maranon-the-grand-canyon-of-the-amazon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">one of the most beautiful river canyons</a></b> in the
world, reminiscent of the Grand Canyon in the USA. Although currently free-flowing, in 2010
then-president Alan García signed a pact with Brazil to provide thousands of MW
of hydropower for export, declaring the damming of the Marañon ""<i>in the
national interest</i>"". So various studies were undertaken (and are still
being done) to forward plans for 15-20 hydroelectric dams on the river (read
more about the planned dams in this<b> <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0035126"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PLOS1</a>
</b>article).<span>.</span></p>
<p>The
impending environmental destruction of the Upper Amazon river was only recently
brought into light. During a 2012 exploratory rafting expedition it was
discovered that there is <b><a href=""http://lab.org.uk/peru-el-maranon-the-environment-communities-and-rivers-be-damned"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fierce
opposition</a></b> to the dams by the residents along the river. The local
Peruvians informed the rafters that underhanded tactics are being implemented
by the damming companies (and the government) to get approval of the
communities and push through the hydro projects. Foreign companies, including <b><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=odebrecht&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=odebrecht&amp;gs_l=heirloom-hp.3..0l10.745.2387.0.2542.9.7.0.2.2.0.246.859.4j2j1.7.0...0.0...1ac.1.12.heirloom-hp.QiiWj5ieRKk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Odebrecht</span></a></b> intend to start construction as
early as next year. Some of these dam building have been discovered to be corrupt while working on nearby Brazilian dams (<b><a href=""http://www.truth-out.org/speakout/item/29493-massive-corruption-scandal-implicates-brazil-s-amazon-dam-builders"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">see recent arrests</a></b>).</p><p></p><h3>The Conservation Effort:</h3>Paddling
with Purpose and <b><a href=""http://www.conservamospornaturaleza.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Conservamos Por Naturaleza</a></b> are working together to
raise awareness about the threats to this amazing river. Along with a group of
Peruvians who are engineers, environmental and social lawyers, biologists,
marketing professionals, graphic designers, and film makers, we will be filming
a documentary about the Rio Marañon and launching a huge media campaign in
Peru.  <br/><p>
</p><p>Like
many dams in the developing world, very few people know about the issues at
hand. Our goal is simple -- to raise awareness about what is going on. The
Peruvian non profit organization <b><a href=""http://www.conservamospornaturaleza.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Conservamos
por Naturaleza</a></b> is launching a campaign to bring the issue to the
public eye within Peru. As part of this campaign, Paddling With Purpose is running 3 projects: <b><a href=""http://paddlingwithpurpose.com/advocacy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Advocacy &amp; Media</a></b>,<b><a href=""http://paddlingwithpurpose.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></b> a <b><a href=""http://paddlingwithpurpose.com/expeditions/training-expedition-may-23-june-11/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Training Expedition</a> </b>and the <b><a href=""http://paddlingwithpurpose.com/remando-juntos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Remando Juntos Expedition</a></b>.
We are part of a group taking a handful of environmentally-minded young

					</p><p></p><p><b><u>LETTER TO PRESIDENT HUMALA (example of what you can write)<br/></u></b></p>Dear President Ollanta Humala, 
					<p>I would like to call your attention to the 
dams planned for Río Marañon, which are NOT in Peru's best interest to 
construct. Río Marañon is still free-flowing and is one of few beautiful
 Grand Canyons of the world. Like the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River
 the United States, the Grand Canyon of Río Marañon deserves to be 
protected and enjoyed by the Peruvian people rather than destroyed by 
foreign companies seeking to make profits by exporting the energy to 
Brazil. The river's residents including the Aguaruna also depend on the 
river for their livelihoods and traditional ways of life. Please halt 
all plans to dam Río Marañon. Peru need not be an energy exporter to 
other nations and there are other sustainable ways to meet the energy 
needs of Peru.<br/>
<br/>
							Consider what will happen if the plans for the hydroelectric dams are actually implemented on Río Marañon.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>(1) Catastrophic environmental impacts.</u></b>
 Currently, the Marañon provides a huge amount of silt to the jungle 
areas and the Amazon River. Dams will disrupt this normal flow pattern 
and lead to beach erosion and altered habitat for multitudinous species.
 Fish migration up and down the river will be blocked by the dams, 
altering the normal ecological balance. Similar dams in the Pacific 
Northwest wreaked havoc on salmon populations, reducing runs of the fish
 from millions to a few thousand per year!<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>(2) Devastating social impacts.</u></b>
 Thousands of people living along the river will be displaced by the 
reservoirs created behind the dams, leading to resentment of you and the
 Peruvian government for allowing such crass actions by foreign 
investment companies over the rights of Peruvian citizens.<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>(3) Negative historical/cultural impacts.</u></b>
 Archeological sites that have yet to be excavated and studied of the 
Inca and Chachapoya cultures are dotted along the river where reservoirs
 are due to extend. The drowning of these cultural artifacts is uncalled
 for, especially before proper assessment of the sites is completed by 
archeologists. Furthermore, are you to allow a complete destruction of 
the cultural heritage signified by Ciro Alegria's best-selling novel ""<b><i><a href=""http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_serpiente_de_oro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">La Serpiente de Oro</a></i></b>"",
 which took place along the banks of Río Marañon in its Grand Canyon? 
This is part of Peru's pride and heritage. Will nobody be able to visit 
the villages and relate to the characters and landscapes in the book 
anymore?<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>(4) Recreational treasure loss. </u></b>The
 Grand Canyon of the United States was in a similar state to the Grand 
Canyon of the Marañon before several dams were constructed at its end 
and just upstream. Few had experienced the majesty of the Colorado River
 in the Grand Canyon before the dams were put in, but now, it is the 
most sought-after river trip experience in the world, with 22,000 people
 floating through the canyon each year and prompting wait lists of over 
20 years to obtain permits to experience it.<br/>
<br/>
							I have also paddled all the major 
rivers in North America. I can say definitively 
that Río Marañon is by far the most precious of all these rivers: it is 
beautiful, unpolluted, raftable, holds monumental stature as the 
hydrological source of the Amazon, and is an extreme joy to experience.<br/>
<br/>
							Please don't let greedy foreign corporations destroy this natural
 treasure in Peru. Instead, protect Río Marañon for future generations 
to appreciate and enjoy, as President Teddy Roosevelt did for the Grand 
Canyon of Arizona. I assure you, if you do, you will be admired and 
respected for generations to come!! <br/></p>

the world,
has an average discharge greater than the next 13 longest rivers combined, and
the greatest number of species. Peru’s
government has plans to construct more
than 20 hydroelectric dams on the 1,056-mile pristine free-flowing Marañón
River, dubbed the Grand Canyon of the Amazon. This invaluable resource begins
in the Peruvian Andes and is the upper source of the Amazon River. The energy will be exported to power mines owned
by corrupt trans-national corporations (google “petrobas scandal dams” for info).
Even if the purpose of the dams wasn’t singular and the dams actually provided
benefits to Peruvian people (which they don’t!), the Rio Maranon dams, combined
with other dams being constructed on Amazon River tributaries, is predicted to
lead to Amazon ecosystem collapse.

This
summer I am volunteering for Paddling With Purpose and the Peruvian NGO Conservamos por Naturaleza (we conserve nature) in an effort to prevent the
Upper Amazon from being dammed. Please support this effort through donations on
this site.  Funds raised will directly go towards the campaign costs to save the Upper Amazon. I sincerely believe in this effort and I hope you can see the value in this project and lend support.
Thanks so much! 
Who is PwP?
We are volunteer scientists, engineers,
photographers, film producers, river rafting guides, whitewater kayakers, and
are all bonafide lovers of nature, people, animals and pure happiness.  We have come together in a grassroots effort
to inform, educate, broadly publicize, and incite a nation to protect their
future and livelihoods. We are tired of knowing, watching, and not
acting while the world sickens around us!! We care about our children, and we
care about creating a better tomorrow. 
Our long-term outlook: Nothing is
more important for a healthy economy and people than living rivers that provide
free reproducing ecosystem services and thriving happy communities. Sure, energy
is necessary, but there are smarter alternatives to dams in 2015. 
We are creating solutions
instead of enabling problems.
What
is PwP doing and What Does Your Support Enable?
· 
Film
documentation, screenings, and a media blitz showing the resources and indigenous
communities along the Grand Canyon of the Amazon that will be lost (resources)
or displaced (people) if the dams are constructed
· 
Dissemination
of scientific information to Peruvian volunteers so they can collect data and
monitor their resources
· 
Training
Peruvians in whitewater safety, rafting and kayaking so they can initiate
sustainable eco-tourism businesses…this means one day you can visit and go
rafting or have a guide service to make your trip easier!
· 
A
massive effort to create media publicity with the end goal of (A) educating the
public about dam impacts, (B) inciting a nation to defend its fishing industry (often
top 3 in the world), sustainable floodplain agriculture industry, way of living,
a sustainable economic future, and (C) to educate about sustainable energy
alternatives 
· 
The
potential to stop dam reservoirs from being created, the creation of which
would dramatically increase release of methane gases and global warming. This
affects you, your taxes, and ""your backyard""!
The Issue:The
Upper Amazon River is under threat of being dammed and needs your help to
prevent its senseless destruction. Please help us in our efforts to stop the
dams. We believe that the mainstem source
of the Amazon (Rio Marañon), the communities and ecosystems it supports are too
important to lose. 
Paddling with Purpose and the Peruvian NGO Conservamos por Naturaleza  have joined forces in creating a series of conservation
projects at local, national and international levels to show why the source of
the Amazon is more valuable in it’s free flowing state than stagnating behind a
series of mega-dams. 
Basically,
one hydro dam is planned after another for the entire length of the river in
the Andes, leaving little or no free-flowing river. This will disrupt the largest
hydrological source of the Amazon, drastically alter normal silt deposition
into the  Amazon river basin, destroy habitat and migration patterns
for fish and other aquatic life, displace thousands of residents along the
river, submerge ancient pre-Incan ruins, and destroy a national treasure on par
with the Grand Canyon in the USA!
The
Río Marañon is the hydrological source of the Amazon and therefore deserves the
title of Upper Amazon. It is also perhaps one of the most beautiful river canyons in the
world, reminiscent of the Grand Canyon in the USA. Although currently free-flowing, in 2010
then-president Alan García signed a pact with Brazil to provide thousands of MW
of hydropower for export, declaring the damming of the Marañon ""in the
national interest"". So various studies were undertaken (and are still
being done) to forward plans for 15-20 hydroelectric dams on the river (read
more about the planned dams in this PLOS1
article)..
The
impending environmental destruction of the Upper Amazon river was only recently
brought into light. During a 2012 exploratory rafting expedition it was
discovered that there is fierce
opposition to the dams by the residents along the river. The local
Peruvians informed the rafters that underhanded tactics are being implemented
by the damming companies (and the government) to get approval of the
communities and push through the hydro projects. Foreign companies, including Odebrecht intend to start construction as
early as next year. Some of these dam building have been discovered to be corrupt while working on nearby Brazilian dams (see recent arrests).The Conservation Effort:Paddling
with Purpose and Conservamos Por Naturaleza are working together to
raise awareness about the threats to this amazing river. Along with a group of
Peruvians who are engineers, environmental and social lawyers, biologists,
marketing professionals, graphic designers, and film makers, we will be filming
a documentary about the Rio Marañon and launching a huge media campaign in
Peru.  
Like
many dams in the developing world, very few people know about the issues at
hand. Our goal is simple -- to raise awareness about what is going on. The
Peruvian non profit organization Conservamos
por Naturaleza is launching a campaign to bring the issue to the
public eye within Peru. As part of this campaign, Paddling With Purpose is running 3 projects: Advocacy & Media, a Training Expedition and the Remando Juntos Expedition.
We are part of a group taking a handful of environmentally-minded young
Peruvians on a raft trip down the Rio Marañon and filming their
journey, aiming to produce a documentary that Conservamos por Naturaleza can
use to engage the Peruvian public in this issue. We have multiple campaigns going for conservation, please go to the Paddling With Purpose site for details about the projects, the budget and strategy, and the team.     Here Are Other Ways You Can Help:
If
you can't donate, share my campaign on facebook or like and share the facebook
pages of Paddling
with Purpose and Conservamos por
Naturaleza. Thank you for your help and your support!Write a Letter:Write and send your own letter to President Humala and various 
ministers in the government: for list of 
addresses, see below. Write and send your own letter to Odebrecht voicing your opposition to their projects. For address, see below. 
					LETTER TO PRESIDENT HUMALA (example of what you can write)Dear President Ollanta Humala, 
					I would like to call your attention to the 
dams planned for Río Marañon, which are NOT in Peru's best interest to 
construct. Río Marañon is still free-flowing and is one of few beautiful
 Grand Canyons of the world. Like the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River
 the United States, the Grand Canyon of Río Marañon deserves to be 
protected and enjoyed by the Peruvian people rather than destroyed by 
foreign companies seeking to make profits by exporting the energy to 
Brazil. The river's residents including the Aguaruna also depend on the 
river for their livelihoods and traditional ways of life. Please halt 
all plans to dam Río Marañon. Peru need not be an energy exporter to 
other nations and there are other sustainable ways to meet the energy 
needs of Peru.

							Consider what will happen if the plans for the hydroelectric dams are actually implemented on Río Marañon.

(1) Catastrophic environmental impacts.
 Currently, the Marañon provides a huge amount of silt to the jungle 
areas and the Amazon River. Dams will disrupt this normal flow pattern 
and lead to beach erosion and altered habitat for multitudinous species.
 Fish migration up and down the river will be blocked by the dams, 
altering the normal ecological balance. Similar dams in the Pacific 
Northwest wreaked havoc on salmon populations, reducing runs of the fish
 from millions to a few thousand per year!

(2) Devastating social impacts.
 Thousands of people living along the river will be displaced by the 
reservoirs created behind the dams, leading to resentment of you and the
 Peruvian government for allowing such crass actions by foreign 
investment companies over the rights of Peruvian citizens.

(3) Negative historical/cultural impacts.
 Archeological sites that have yet to be excavated and studied of the 
Inca and Chachapoya cultures are dotted along the river where reservoirs
 are due to extend. The drowning of these cultural artifacts is uncalled
 for, especially before proper assessment of the sites is completed by 
archeologists. Furthermore, are you to allow a complete destruction of 
the cultural heritage signified by Ciro Alegria's best-selling novel ""La Serpiente de Oro"",
 which took place along the banks of Río Marañon in its Grand Canyon? 
This is part of Peru's pride and heritage. Will nobody be able to visit 
the villages and relate to the characters and landscapes in the book 
anymore?

(4) Recreational treasure loss. The
 Grand Canyon of the United States was in a similar state to the Grand 
Canyon of the Marañon before several dams were constructed at its end 
and just upstream. Few had experienced the majesty of the Colorado River
 in the Grand Canyon before the dams were put in, but now, it is the 
most sought-after river trip experience in the world, with 22,000 people
 floating through the canyon each year and prompting wait lists of over 
20 years to obtain permits to experience it.

							I have also paddled all the major 
rivers in North America. I can say definitively 
that Río Marañon is by far the most precious of all these rivers: it is 
beautiful, unpolluted, raftable, holds monumental stature as the 
hydrological source of the Amazon, and is an extreme joy to experience.

							Please don't let greedy foreign corporations destroy this natural
 treasure in Peru. Instead, protect Río Marañon for future generations 
to appreciate and enjoy, as President Teddy Roosevelt did for the Grand 
Canyon of Arizona. I assure you, if you do, you will be admired and 
respected for generations to come!!

<h3>About the Creator and the Vision<br/>
</h3>Hello, I'm James Novak and the Founder/ Visionary of Hemp Solutions USA.
  <br/>I started this organization in 2011, with the primary purpose of 
rebuilding Community &amp; restoring the Environment.  In my many travels over the
 years, I have come to learn that the hemp plant is one of the most 
important plants to exist in our environment.  Aside from its super food 
status, it also creates multiple fuels, clean energy from biomass, 
superior clothing, fiber, medicine, and biodegradable plastics. Hemp is 
also being grown at the Chernobyl (RU) &amp; Hanford Sites (USA) for bio-remediation, which is a process of 
restoring the soil by removing toxins, radiation, and heavy metals.  I have devoted my life to bringing about positive change in the world. I need your help to move forward with an amazing vision we all can share and benefit from on this planet we call home. <br/><br/><b>My vision</b> is to use the Net Profit from sales of a legal Hemp Foods Product Line to directly support Community Outreach, Education, and Environmental Restoration.<br/><br/>When I mention ""Net Profit"" I mean 100% of the Profit after the bills/taxes
 to run the business are paid.  I am NOT here for monetary gain - I am here to create positive change in 
the World and to protect FUTURE GENERATIONS - that's it :)<br/><br/>Sometimes the only way to create change in the World is to LEAD BY EXAMPLE!<br/><br/><b>Hemp Seed is fully legal in the United States in all 50 States</b> and contains 0% THC.  Hemp seed can be purchased at most health food stores and even Costco. <br/><br/>Hemp seed contains all 21 Amino Acids,
high amounts of Globulin Edestin rich Protein, Iron and Magnesium, plus a very healthy ratio of Omega EFA's 3, 6, 9!<br/><b><br/>Its time to come together under a mission of saving 
the Planet &amp; its People! <br/></b>Future generations are relying on our 
decisions for their survival and health. <br/><br/><b>Who is Hemp Solutions USA and what do we stand for?</b><br/><br/><b>Our slogan:</b> ""Sustainable Solutions with a Positive Impact on ALL""<br/><b>Our Mission:</b> To save the Planet &amp; the People by promoting Sustainable Solutions!<br/><b>How we are going to do that:</b> We are here to create a Unique Hemp Product Line <br/>capable of generating profit that can be directed towards Community Outreach &amp; Environmental Restoration Projects.  Educational programs will also be a major goal of the Organization. We aim to promote Sustainability &amp; Permaculture  through these Educational Programs.<br/><br/><p>The United States is currently the largest importer of Hemp Products 
in the World and annual sales of Hemp Products are estimated at OVER 
$500 MILLION/YEAR!</p>
<p>Sales of these products will rise dramatically over the next 5 years as Hemp Farming returns to the United States and more products become readily available.<br/></p>
<p>We aim to be one of the main Organizations using money from sales to give directly back.
You can track our projects through the website and see the impact it has on the Planet. <br/></p>
<p><b>Every penny you contribute goes to making a positive change in the World!</b><br/></p>
<br/><h3>Our #1 Goal from Fundraising</h3>
<p>The main goal of this fundraiser is to raise enough money to start our very own health food product line.  We have been working hard the last few years to make this vision a reality, but we need the remaining $10,000 to complete our goal and to successfully launch the product line.  Our product line will include several different healthy food products and be packaged in Earth-friendly Biodegradable Packaging.</p>
<p>We already have our accounts and vendor relationships established.  Our funding will go directly towards the start up of our product line, regardless of the success of this fundraising campaign. All money goes towards making a positive impact!  <br/></p>
<p>Initial Start-up Costs to launch the Product Line have included:<br/></p>
<p>1) Building location and permits necessary to run a Food Processing business.<br/></p>
<p>2) Raw Materials Cost (Legal Hemp Seed from Canada) to repackage under our own legal product name/label.  Hemp seed is fully legal to import and to sell in all 50 States. It contains ZERO THC and has been heat sterilized so that it cannot grow.</p>
<p>3) Packaging Costs - the purchasing of Biodegradable Packaging for all of our products.  We are using Biodegradable Packaging with all products we sell. <br/></p>
<p>We have selected a packaging supplier, and raw materials supplier.  The product line is poised to launch immediately upon the success of the remaining funding.<br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately funding is not easy in this day and age, so we are here to ask for your support in making this dream become a reality so that the lives of many can benefit.<br/></p>
<p><b>PLEASE HELP TO MAKE A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THE WORLD AROUND US!</b>      <br/></p>
<p>                            <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact that your money will have:</h3>Track projects through the website and see the positive impact your money is having on Communities and the Environment across the United States.  There you will be able to see Pictures, Videos, and Testimonials of how the money from sales has helped across the Nation!  We plan to roll this model out to other cities around the United States and to have a network spanning the whole Country.  The projects we roll out will have a positive impact on not only the USA, but the entire World!<br/>Projects include, but are not limited to: <br/><b><ul>
<li>Food &amp; Clothing Drives</li>
<li>Building of Urban Gardens and Community Geodomes</li>
<li>Installation of Renewable Energy to Communities in need</li>

<li>Much more to come with your help and support - infinite possibilities!</li>
</ul></b>Many more projects to come with the love and support from others like yourselves!<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>We are only limited by funding, and we know that when our fundraising goal is met we will be successful in starting this product line and with getting our projects rolling out to communities in need across the Country.  We have confidence and have invested a great deal of time and money into making this vision a reality.<br/><br/><b>Supernova Success is at hand - with just $10,000 standing in our way!<br/></b><br/>Regardless of the success of this fundraiser campaign, the money will all go towards making this vision a reality so that future generations can be protected.<br/><br/><b>Upon success of the fundraiser</b> - we will launch the product line within 30 days.<br/>Within 90 days of the success of the fundraiser we will fulfill all Perks.<br/><br/><div>
<b>In the case that this fundraiser does not complete successfully:</b> <br/>We
 will use the money raised to sell products local to Michigan at Farmers 
Markets. Sales at Farmer's Markets will go towards making local projects
 possible until the funding is available to go Nationwide with our 
products. <br/><b><br/></b><p><b>We will be offering lifetime discounts to those who contribute $30 or more!</b>    (see 'Perks' section for more details)</p>
<p><br/></p>

also being grown at the Chernobyl (RU) & Hanford Sites (USA) for bio-remediation, which is a process of 
restoring the soil by removing toxins, radiation, and heavy metals.  I have devoted my life to bringing about positive change in the world. I need your help to move forward with an amazing vision we all can share and benefit from on this planet we call home. My vision is to use the Net Profit from sales of a legal Hemp Foods Product Line to directly support Community Outreach, Education, and Environmental Restoration.When I mention ""Net Profit"" I mean 100% of the Profit after the bills/taxes
 to run the business are paid.  I am NOT here for monetary gain - I am here to create positive change in 
the World and to protect FUTURE GENERATIONS - that's it :)Sometimes the only way to create change in the World is to LEAD BY EXAMPLE!Hemp Seed is fully legal in the United States in all 50 States and contains 0% THC.  Hemp seed can be purchased at most health food stores and even Costco. Hemp seed contains all 21 Amino Acids,
high amounts of Globulin Edestin rich Protein, Iron and Magnesium, plus a very healthy ratio of Omega EFA's 3, 6, 9!Its time to come together under a mission of saving 
the Planet & its People! Future generations are relying on our 
decisions for their survival and health. Who is Hemp Solutions USA and what do we stand for?Our slogan: ""Sustainable Solutions with a Positive Impact on ALL""Our Mission: To save the Planet & the People by promoting Sustainable Solutions!How we are going to do that: We are here to create a Unique Hemp Product Line capable of generating profit that can be directed towards Community Outreach & Environmental Restoration Projects.  Educational programs will also be a major goal of the Organization. We aim to promote Sustainability & Permaculture  through these Educational Programs.The United States is currently the largest importer of Hemp Products 
in the World and annual sales of Hemp Products are estimated at OVER 
$500 MILLION/YEAR!
Sales of these products will rise dramatically over the next 5 years as Hemp Farming returns to the United States and more products become readily available.
We aim to be one of the main Organizations using money from sales to give directly back.
You can track our projects through the website and see the impact it has on the Planet. 
Every penny you contribute goes to making a positive change in the World!
Our #1 Goal from Fundraising
The main goal of this fundraiser is to raise enough money to start our very own health food product line.  We have been working hard the last few years to make this vision a reality, but we need the remaining $10,000 to complete our goal and to successfully launch the product line.  Our product line will include several different healthy food products and be packaged in Earth-friendly Biodegradable Packaging.
We already have our accounts and vendor relationships established.  Our funding will go directly towards the start up of our product line, regardless of the success of this fundraising campaign. All money goes towards making a positive impact!  
Initial Start-up Costs to launch the Product Line have included:
1) Building location and permits necessary to run a Food Processing business.
2) Raw Materials Cost (Legal Hemp Seed from Canada) to repackage under our own legal product name/label.  Hemp seed is fully legal to import and to sell in all 50 States. It contains ZERO THC and has been heat sterilized so that it cannot grow.
3) Packaging Costs - the purchasing of Biodegradable Packaging for all of our products.  We are using Biodegradable Packaging with all products we sell. 
We have selected a packaging supplier, and raw materials supplier.  The product line is poised to launch immediately upon the success of the remaining funding.
Unfortunately funding is not easy in this day and age, so we are here to ask for your support in making this dream become a reality so that the lives of many can benefit.
PLEASE HELP TO MAKE A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THE WORLD AROUND US!      
                            

The impact that your money will have:Track projects through the website and see the positive impact your money is having on Communities and the Environment across the United States.  There you will be able to see Pictures, Videos, and Testimonials of how the money from sales has helped across the Nation!  We plan to roll this model out to other cities around the United States and to have a network spanning the whole Country.  The projects we roll out will have a positive impact on not only the USA, but the entire World!Projects include, but are not limited to: 
Food & Clothing Drives
Building of Urban Gardens and Community Geodomes
Installation of Renewable Energy to Communities in need
Building of Eco-friendly homes for Families in need
Permaculture Workshops & Educational Projects
Much more to come with your help and support - infinite possibilities!
Many more projects to come with the love and support from others like yourselves!
  Risks & ChallengesWe are only limited by funding, and we know that when our fundraising goal is met we will be successful in starting this product line and with getting our projects rolling out to communities in need across the Country.  We have confidence and have invested a great deal of time and money into making this vision a reality.Supernova Success is at hand - with just $10,000 standing in our way!Regardless of the success of this fundraiser campaign, the money will all go towards making this vision a reality so that future generations can be protected.Upon success of the fundraiser - we will launch the product line within 30 days.Within 90 days of the success of the fundraiser we will fulfill all Perks.
In the case that this fundraiser does not complete successfully: We
 will use the money raised to sell products local to Michigan at Farmers 
Markets. Sales at Farmer's Markets will go towards making local projects
 possible until the funding is available to go Nationwide with our 
products. We will be offering lifetime discounts to those who contribute $30 or more!    (see 'Perks' section for more details)



Other Ways You Can HelpIn the coming weeks ahead, we will be modifying our website to include Project Information, and a Forum for discussion. We want to network Communities, share healing ideas, and help to restore the environment we all share in this great Nation!An Organization and Vision that every American should be proud to support!If you would like to help, please contact James at: james@hemp-solutions.org",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Housing developments don’t need good soils to grow. Food does. How can you
argue with that? </p>

you can have on this world. ASA has raised the majority of the funds for this
project and Joan is generously donating a portion of her development rights,

of Greenwich. This historic farm, a beautiful landmark in Washington County,
has been in agricultural production since before the Civil War. The farm was a
successful dairy operation for most of the 100 years it has been owned by
Joan’s family.    The farm’s 159 acres of large cultivated
fields near the Batten Kill contain some of the richest agricultural soils in
the town. This irreplaceable resource now serves primarily as support land for
a local dairy operation. Unfortunately, the McArthur-Sauert Farm is at high
risk of being converted to non-agricultural use if not protected. Its close proximity
to Saratoga County, extensive road frontage and flat, well drained soils make
the property susceptible to development.        When Joan approached ASA, she told
stories about what the farm meant to her family and what it has come to mean to
her. Joan understands the value of good soils: “With so much good farmland
disappearing, where are people going to get their food from in the future?”
Housing developments don’t need good soils to grow. Food does. How can you
argue with that? 
Joan is determined that her land stay in
farm production. With the funds she will receive in return for conserving her
farm, she will start the restoration of the beautiful configuration of roadside
19th Century barns back to their original condition.To Joan, like so many others, it seems a simple
gift, but one that will be enjoyed forever by generations we will never meet.
Think about it: conserving land is one of the few lasting and permanent effects
you can have on this world. ASA has raised the majority of the funds for this
project and Joan is generously donating a portion of her development rights,
but we still need to raise the remaining $7,000. We’re counting on help from people who care about where their food comes from to help make this project happen. Please consider making a
donation today to protect this treasure.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In respect of “Earth Day” we have organized a non-profit plan of reforestation to recover the devastated natural areas in Gorski Kotar. The event is called ""FORESTS ARE LIFE”, and is planned for Saturday, April 13th</p>
<p>Our goal is to put people from all walks of life, ages and beliefs into one group with the same mission  to promote :</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity of community and the understanding of its purpose </li>
<li>A sustainable way of life in symbiosis with nature</li>
<li>Environmental protection</li>
<li>Education for all generations</li>
</ul>
<p>Trees help sustain life by absorbing CO2, creating oxygen, providing shade, protecting soil from erosion, safeguarding ground water, and guarding biodiversity. Each tree planted captures 1 ton of C02 by the time it reaches maturity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking to have well over 500+ volunteers. We need about 4000 EUR to reach our goal. That money will be used  to sustain the volunteers. We're providing them free drinks, and lunch. We are providing transportation for all students and teachers to the planting site. </p>
<p>After the hard work, we have organized a live concert in the town square for the community, as a way to thank everyone involved. </p>
<p>We would also like to hire a camera man to capture this special day so that we can create a video and share it all around the world to further inspire people to be the change!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The SUCCESS of this non-profit action is to encourage all generations and people of different financial frameworks to work together to rebuild the forest areas affected by natural disasters. Through education, and an understanding of the environment where we live together, we want to do our best to preserve and improve this area for future generations.</p>
<p>During the planting, we have an expert coming to teach the volunteers about how to better sustain our forests, and the impact of what they're doing that day will have on their environment.</p>
<p>It's so important for the little ones watching us to see the importance of respecting nature and that we can all work together as a community for the better of the world around us. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges we face are quite clear. We may overestimate, or even underestimate the amount of volunteers that sign up. We may not raise enough funds to be able to provide them with everything we hope to provide them with. In the case scenario with rain, we'll postpone the whole event for two weeks. But we have a firm plan in place for these types of situations, and we will overcome any obstacles!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Life is tough for a baby sea turtle. Just one out of a
thousand turtle hatchlings survives until adulthood. Facing poaching, getting caught in
fishing gear, and other threats, and its not surprising that six out of seven
species are threatened or endangered. Billion Baby Turtles works to reverse
that trend and our goal is to fill the ocean with turtle hatchlings.</p>
<p>With your help, we can save another 10,000 endangered hawksbill
sea turtle hatchlings in El Salvador by supporting the great work of the
Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative (ICAPO). There are only an estimated 500 nesting female hawksbills along the entire Pacific coast of the America’s but the ICAPO
network is working hard to protect one of the most important nesting areas at
Jiquilisco Bay by working with local residents to save the eggs and protect the
adults from fishing and other threats.</p>
<p>We believe conservation should have concrete outcomes. For every dollar that we raise, we will save at least two turtle hatchlings by providing the funds needed to hire people to patrol nesting beaches, build hatcheries that keep the eggs safe until hatching, and supporting educational programs. Since the project launched in April 2013, we have helped save more than 250,000 hatchlings at ten important turtle nesting beaches in Latin America.<br/></p>
<p>Our stretch goal is $10,000, which if reached, would allow
us to fund egg collection programs at the two critical hawksbill nesting areas
in the region, which make up 90% of the known nesting of the population. The
result would be 20,000 hatchlings saved in Nicaragua and El Salvador, in
addition to supporting local residents with important income.</p>
<p>Billion Baby Turtles was founded by two lifelong turtle
conservationists, Dr. Wallace J. Nichols and Brad Nahill, who spent years
working with community-based conservation programs in Mexico and Costa Rica.
This initiative is part of SEE Turtles, a non-profit project that supports sea
turtle conservation through travel and education.</p>
<p><b>Please note: </b>Your donations will go through our sponsor, The Oceanic Society. You will receive an email confirmation once you donate.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have a big long-term goal, to put a billion hatchlings into the
ocean to help restore sea turtle populations. With your help, we can put a dent
in that big goal while helping to support deserving community-based turtle
conservation projects around the world. The result will be at least 10,000
hatchlings protected in 2014. </p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise at least $5,000 which
will support efforts to protect one of the most endangered turtle populations
in the world, the hawksbill turtles living along the Pacific coast of the
America’s. Our partners at the Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative run an
inspiring project in El Salvador in a beautiful place called Jiquilisco Bay. Here,
a group of former poachers now work to protect the hawksbills by bringing their
eggs to hatcheries, where they are protected until they hatch and then released
to the ocean. </p>
<p>If we reach our stretch goal of $10,000 raised, we will be
able to extend support to the other main hawksbill nesting area in the region,
Padre Ramos Estuary. Roughly 90% of the Eastern Pacific hawksbill nest at Padre
Ramos or Jiquilisco Bay and this would help to save roughly 20,000 hatchlings
in 2015, representing nearly every hatchling produced at these two critically
important nesting beaches.</p>
<p>In return for your generosity, we have a huge variety of turtle-themed
and eco-friendly perks. We have handmade jewelry (including some made in Costa
Rica), reusable water bottles, recycled plastic handbags, and much more. For
the real turtle lovers, we have a gift pack with just about every turtley thing
you can imagine. Check out our gallery for photos of some of the perks and check back often for new ones that we'll add as the campaign goes on. </p>
<p>* If we reach our stretch goal, every $50 or higher donor will receive a photo of a hatchling from Nicaragua in addition to their perks and $100 donors and up will receive a framed photo.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Healthy oceans and coastal communities need sea turtles.
They help to keep prey like jellyfish under control and their nests help
stabilize beaches. They help coastal communities by providing a great
ecotourism attraction and many indigenous cultures celebrate them. Watching a
sea turtle come ashore to lay its eggs is an extraordinary experience that
everyone should be able to have. </p>
<p>To date Billion Baby Turtles has
provided enough funding to save more than 250,000 hatchlings at 10 important
nesting beaches around Latin America. SEE Turtles has provided financial
support to protect Eastern Pacific hawksbills since 2011 and to date we have
helped to save nearly 50,000 hatchlings at the two most important nesting
beaches. </p>
<p>This money will go towards ICAPO’s egg collection program,
which pays local residents to monitor the beaches in the sites in El Salvador
and Nicaragua. Once a resident finds a turtle, they carefully bring the eggs to
hatcheries, where they are reburied and monitored until they hatch. Residents
are paid for every egg they bring as well as how many of them hatch, which
incentivizes them to take special care of the eggs while transporting them.
This program has allowed residents to earn income for protecting the eggs as
opposed to selling them on the illegal black market and is a key source of
money in areas with high unemployment and low wages.  </p>

Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative (ICAPO). There are only an estimated 500 nesting female hawksbills along the entire Pacific coast of the America’s but the ICAPO
network is working hard to protect one of the most important nesting areas at
Jiquilisco Bay by working with local residents to save the eggs and protect the
adults from fishing and other threats.
We believe conservation should have concrete outcomes. For every dollar that we raise, we will save at least two turtle hatchlings by providing the funds needed to hire people to patrol nesting beaches, build hatcheries that keep the eggs safe until hatching, and supporting educational programs. Since the project launched in April 2013, we have helped save more than 250,000 hatchlings at ten important turtle nesting beaches in Latin America.
Our stretch goal is $10,000, which if reached, would allow
us to fund egg collection programs at the two critical hawksbill nesting areas
in the region, which make up 90% of the known nesting of the population. The
result would be 20,000 hatchlings saved in Nicaragua and El Salvador, in
addition to supporting local residents with important income.
Billion Baby Turtles was founded by two lifelong turtle
conservationists, Dr. Wallace J. Nichols and Brad Nahill, who spent years
working with community-based conservation programs in Mexico and Costa Rica.
This initiative is part of SEE Turtles, a non-profit project that supports sea
turtle conservation through travel and education.
Please note: Your donations will go through our sponsor, The Oceanic Society. You will receive an email confirmation once you donate.

   What We Need & What You Get 

We have a big long-term goal, to put a billion hatchlings into the
ocean to help restore sea turtle populations. With your help, we can put a dent
in that big goal while helping to support deserving community-based turtle
conservation projects around the world. The result will be at least 10,000
hatchlings protected in 2014. 
Our goal for this campaign is to raise at least $5,000 which
will support efforts to protect one of the most endangered turtle populations
in the world, the hawksbill turtles living along the Pacific coast of the
America’s. Our partners at the Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative run an
inspiring project in El Salvador in a beautiful place called Jiquilisco Bay. Here,
a group of former poachers now work to protect the hawksbills by bringing their
eggs to hatcheries, where they are protected until they hatch and then released
to the ocean. 
If we reach our stretch goal of $10,000 raised, we will be
able to extend support to the other main hawksbill nesting area in the region,
Padre Ramos Estuary. Roughly 90% of the Eastern Pacific hawksbill nest at Padre
Ramos or Jiquilisco Bay and this would help to save roughly 20,000 hatchlings
in 2015, representing nearly every hatchling produced at these two critically
important nesting beaches.
In return for your generosity, we have a huge variety of turtle-themed
and eco-friendly perks. We have handmade jewelry (including some made in Costa
Rica), reusable water bottles, recycled plastic handbags, and much more. For
the real turtle lovers, we have a gift pack with just about every turtley thing
you can imagine. Check out our gallery for photos of some of the perks and check back often for new ones that we'll add as the campaign goes on. 
* If we reach our stretch goal, every $50 or higher donor will receive a photo of a hatchling from Nicaragua in addition to their perks and $100 donors and up will receive a framed photo.
   The Impact 


Healthy oceans and coastal communities need sea turtles.
They help to keep prey like jellyfish under control and their nests help
stabilize beaches. They help coastal communities by providing a great
ecotourism attraction and many indigenous cultures celebrate them. Watching a
sea turtle come ashore to lay its eggs is an extraordinary experience that
everyone should be able to have. 
To date Billion Baby Turtles has
provided enough funding to save more than 250,000 hatchlings at 10 important
nesting beaches around Latin America. SEE Turtles has provided financial
support to protect Eastern Pacific hawksbills since 2011 and to date we have
helped to save nearly 50,000 hatchlings at the two most important nesting
beaches. 
This money will go towards ICAPO’s egg collection program,
which pays local residents to monitor the beaches in the sites in El Salvador
and Nicaragua. Once a resident finds a turtle, they carefully bring the eggs to
hatcheries, where they are reburied and monitored until they hatch. Residents
are paid for every egg they bring as well as how many of them hatch, which
incentivizes them to take special care of the eggs while transporting them.
This program has allowed residents to earn income for protecting the eggs as
opposed to selling them on the illegal black market and is a key source of
money in areas with high unemployment and low wages.  

    Other Ways You Can Help 


Donations are great but aren’t the only way you can help. The
best way to help protect sea turtles is by joining one of our volunteer
expeditions to Costa Rica, Mexico, Cuba, Nicaragua, or El Salvador. Learn more
about these unique experiences at SEEturtles.org. 
The more people we reach, the more successful we will be so
please help share the word with friends and family, on Facebook and Twitter, by
email or dinnertime conversation! Contact us at info@seeturtles.org if you are interested in our referral
program, where you can earn perks for recruiting donors to our campaign. Learn more about Billion Baby Turtles here.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

protecting its outdoor heritage. 
In 2012, we joined forces with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to launch the On the Ground (OTG) program, which was honored with 
Outdoor
Life's Open Country Award after just its first year. This outstanding program engages volunteers in the improvement of fish and wildlife habitats throughout the state of Michigan. Thanks to a steady growth of volunteers and projects, the program has been able to help even more fish and wildlife habitats. In two years, over 400 volunteers have completed 21 projects across all regions of Michigan.OTG is about more than just improving fish and wildlife habitat on public lands though; it’s also about education. The program allows the volunteers who invest their time to gain a deeper understanding of the habit needs of fish and wildlife.
What We Need & What You GetIn order for OTG to grow and to ensure our volunteers’ precious time is spent effectively and productively, we need the right equipment.
We need to raise $500 to purchase equipment for volunteers to use when working. We’re specifically looking to purchase a chainsaw (with the necessary safety equipment) and chest waders. Any donation helps us, but if we don't meet our funding goal then we'll purchase as much equipment as the funding allows.

</p><p>Thankyou for landing here! As I'm sure most of you are
aware I'm Jess, a 21 year old aspiring marine scientist from Hobart, Tasmania.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to be accepted into an Ocean Conservation Research Internship program in South Africa in 2015. The three
months I'll be spending in South Africa will not only assist me in gaining momentum as
an advocate for healthy ocean ecosystems and marine life, it will provide me with crucial experience and knowledge in this field beyond what I would undertake as
an undergraduate student. The internship will include involvement in a
dedicated ocean conservation research program, providing education about oceans
to South African school children whilst encouraging them to make positive
choices and changes for the environment and finally assisting in hands on Great
White Shark research and public awareness campaigns.  </p>
<p>I am greatly passionate about this cause for a
number of reasons. Perhaps the most important reason to human beings is that the
health of life on land runs in direct correlation with the
health of oceans globally. Every second breath we take comes from the sea! As
the legendary Sylvia Earle put it; “People ask: Why should I care about the
ocean? Because the ocean is the cornerstone of earth's life support system, it
shapes climate and weather. It holds most of life on earth. 97% of earth's
water is there. It's the blue heart of the planet — we should take care of our
heart. It's what makes life possible for us. We still have a really good chance
to make things better than they are. They won't get better unless we take the
action and inspire others to do the same thing. No one is without power.
Everybody has the capacity to do something.” </p>
<p>Okay, now I'm starting to waffle!
Basically, this fund is to assist in paying for my flights to and from South
Africa. I was hoping to entirely fund this experience myself and was very
reluctant to ask for donations, however, that may have been more than a little
ambitious! I would be so grateful for any contribution however large or small! Don't forget to claim a gift in return for your support, they're down the right hand side of the page! </p><p>Thankyou
so much to Petra &amp; Greg from Bonorong and Shae &amp; Matthew from Pollen
Tea Room for really generously donating some gifts for me to provide to my
supporters. I plan to put my newly gained knowledge and experience to good work
upon arrival back in Hobart.  I've attached a relevant video that
briefly touches on why this is such a crucial cause (and an attempt to spice
this page up a bit). </p>
<p>Thankyou so so much,</p>
<p>J.  </p>

Everybody has the capacity to do something.” 
Okay, now I'm starting to waffle!
Basically, this fund is to assist in paying for my flights to and from South
Africa. I was hoping to entirely fund this experience myself and was very
reluctant to ask for donations, however, that may have been more than a little
ambitious! I would be so grateful for any contribution however large or small! Don't forget to claim a gift in return for your support, they're down the right hand side of the page! Thankyou
so much to Petra & Greg from Bonorong and Shae & Matthew from Pollen
Tea Room for really generously donating some gifts for me to provide to my
supporters. I plan to put my newly gained knowledge and experience to good work
upon arrival back in Hobart.  I've attached a relevant video that
briefly touches on why this is such a crucial cause (and an attempt to spice
this page up a bit). 
Thankyou so so much,

<p>Sport Kitchen ‘Team Gaffer’ Gareth Wotton explained. “Although we use 95% recyclable plastic, we would rather not. It doesn’t sit comfortably with our ethos, and with the recent news that a massive eight million pieces of plastic enter the world’s oceans every day, it’s time for action. The “UK Plastics Pact”, signed in April 2018, saw the big businesses agree to aim to stop using single-use plastics by 2025, a worthy target but a very distant one. That’s an awful lot of days at 8 million items per day.”</p>
</div></div><div>So here at Sport Kitchen, we’ve vowed to make the change, and make it now. But we need some help along the way, and that’s where you come in. We have the necessary funds to commission the machinery required to go green but, need to raise £20,000 in order to buy the volume of packaging materials to help us eradicate the plastic and bring in something far more eco-friendly. The big boys have the resources to do this, but we have just our heart, our vision and our energy so we need your help in this.</div><div> </div><p>Remember the song, “It Isn’t Easy Being Green”?

<h3>What is Relief4Sandy?</h3>
#Relief4Sandy is a movement dedicated to the relief of those affected by Hurricane Sandy that occurred in late October 2012.

#Relief4Sandy is a movement dedicated to the relief of those affected by Hurricane Sandy that occurred in late October 2012. Hurricane Sandy struck the Northeastern Coast, Mid-Atlantic and some parts of the Caribbean which caused the loss of homes, power, heat, well being, memories, and normal way of life. This movement is a united effort with those from all parts of the world who want to be active and involved. We are using indiegogo.com to raise funds which will be donated to the American Red Cross and another organization, that is undetermined at the moment, for those who were affected. We will help by working with others, using social media, and implementing conservative fund raising methods. #Relief4Sandy is working hard to make a difference and help change people’s lives for the better.

How can you help?
We need YOU to make a difference and help. Here are 3-steps on how YOU can get involved.
Step 1. Email us at Relief4Sandy@gmail.com with a photo and/or video of your experience of Hurricane Sandy in your immediate area. A picture/video can be of any damage, long gas lines, floods, or anything you had witnessed during/after Hurricane Sandy. The picture/video will be posted on our blog to help spread awareness.
Step 2. Join the movement by visiting our Indiegogo page. By donating the minimum of $10 you will receive a #Relief4Sandy wristband. Donations of $25 or more there will be other incentives to show our appreciation.
Step 3. Spread the News! Relief and awareness of Hurricane Sandy is not over and there are victims that still need our help. You can continue to be involved by spreading the Hashtag #Relief4Sandy on your social media post(s) through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Pentagono design is an international team of 5 Master students at the Industrial Design &amp; Engineering faculty at the Technical University of Delft. Catalina from Colombia and Irene from Italy are strategic product designers, Olaf and Jaco from The Netherlands are integrated product designers, and Paul from Taiwan is an interaction designer. Our team was created in June 2012 to conduct the Joint Master Project with a common goal: use our capabilities to design for a <a href=""http://www.baseofthepyramid.nl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Base Of the Pyramid</a> context with human centred design and participatory design as key drivers to develop actionable and meaningful solutions.</p>
<h3>What is the project about?</h3>
<p>Currently in Sulawesi, Indonesia an NGO led by Willie Smits named the Masarang Foundation is working together with the local community to preserve the rainforest and reforest pieces of land of which some, especially in Kalimantan, are degraded by the palm oil industry. They do this by exploiting a palm tree called the ‘sugar palm’ that can only live in a mixed forest. This palm tree delivers sugar juice on a daily basis that is processed into sugar and sold by Masarang. The selling of the sugar provides income for the local community. The local community knows that their source of income, the sugar palm, is dependent on the mixed forest so they protect this forest against illegal loggers and the palm oil industry. Masarang also uses the money earned with the sugar for reforestation programs and community development.<br/><br/>Masarang designed a smaller version of the Tomohon factory called the ‘village hub’. Their goal is to install these village hubs in multiple parts of Indonesia where the land has been degraded by the palm oil industry. The land will be reforested and the sugar palm trees will be planted to create income for the local people. The success of this goal depends on the willingness of the local people to adapt the sugar palm as their source of income and become ‘sugar palm farmers’. Increasing the value of the sugar palm for the local people can enhance their willingness to use it in a sustainable way, therefore contributing with the reforestation of Indonesia. Within this perspective, Masarang sees potential in other commodities from the sugar palm, such as the sugar palm fruit that is currently not being used.<br/><br/>Our project assignment is to develop a product with the sugar palm fruit as a basis in order to increase the value of the sugar palm for the villagers. We will first research the possibilities of the fruit. What can we make out of it? A food product, or maybe a beauty product? Then we will perform a market research. Should we sell it in Indonesia? Or is it better to ship it to the Netherlands and sell it here? With this knowledge we will design the product and its business model.<br/> <br/>We will also need to design the production process. The product should be produced by local people using local resources and use as little energy as possible. This includes the design of production tools (e.g. for harvesting, transporting or cooking the fruit) and clear instructions for implementation.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/willie_smits_restores_a_rainforest.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here for a TED talk of Willie Smits on how to restore a rainforest</a><br/><br/><a href=""http://www.masarang.nl/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to read about Masarang foundation and its current projects</a><br/><br/><a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2011/06/110623-tapergie-sugar-palm-biofuel/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here for more information about the sugar palm and the Village hubs</a><br/><br/></p>
<h3>Why design research?</h3>
<p>Our approach is build on the basis that research should inform and inspire our design and development process. Human centered design aims to understand the context and relations where the product or service interacts with the users in order to better meet their needs. Furthermore, participatory design (generative design research and co-creation) actively involves people served through the upcoming products or services as experts in the design and development process. Through methods, techniques and tools designed specifically to the context and project characteristics, participatory design gives voice to communities and allows their desires to be the drivers of the design and development of solutions.<br/><br/>Consequently with our approach and project background we are going to Tomohon for two months (February 28 to April 28 2013) to conduct in-context research and design phases of our project. Involving local people in the design process not only ensures meaningful solutions but also increases their engagement with the upcoming project testing and implementation phases.<br/><br/>Participatory design techniques and tools are empathic techniques that motivate non-designers to participate in different activities for specific parts of the design process. Furthermore, this approach helps to lower language and communication barriers between the design team, the local community and other project stakeholders. A human centered design mindset will allow us to dive deep into the local culture, share knowledge and underpin opportunities for meaningful solutions.<br/><br/>For more information about design-led research techniques visit:<br/><br/><a href=""http://amiadesigner.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Am I A designer</a><br/><br/><a href=""http://www.hcdconnect.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HCD connect</a></p>
<h3>How can you help us?</h3>
<p>We are highly motivated and ready to start this project. We have been working and preparing ourselves to carry out an insightful research in the real context. However we need your support to make this happen.<br/><br/>Local research not only implies our transportation from The Netherlands to Indonesia but also the creation of research materials, local expenses and prototyping of the product and production tools. For this we need financial support. We will appreciate your collaboration. We ask you to donate from 5 to 500 euro and be part of this challenge to protect the rainforest in Indonesia.<br/><br/>We believe that learning from local people and diving deep into their environment will ensure a successful project development, will contribute to the overall goal of reforestation in Indonesia and will enrich our professional and personal experience.</p>

With the $57,369 we’ve raised from these campaigns and via offline donations, we're breaking down policy barriers and raising public awareness of the opportunities of the geothermal power and heat industry in Canada.</span><br/></p>
<p>In reality, the industry needs 10x our goal amount so that we can <b>hire <a href=""http://www.cangea.ca/geothermal-needs-a-lobbyist-just-like-everybody-else/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">government relations professionals to assist us</a> with our federal and provincial policy influencing efforts</b>. This is vitally important because government relations professionals can get our message to those officials that will make a real difference, like what happens in every other industry such as wind, solar, oil &amp; gas and mining. We’re trying to catch up and play at the same level as everyone else to get the same action.</p>
<p>We are now accepting contributions via the <b><a href=""www.cangea.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Donate PayPal Button</a></b> at the bottom of our website as we prepare arguments on why Geothermal is a better option for the West than Site C Hydro or Coal Fired Power Plants.</p>
<p><b><i>Campaign Update:</i></b></p>
<p><b>Former Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Brian Peckford, has spoken out in favour of CanGEA’s recent report. He agrees with the recommendation that a moratorium be placed upon the Site C project, while alternatives such as geothermal energy are fully investigated. </b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Peckford is often recognized for his instrumental role in the crafting of Newfoundland and Labrador’s successful energy sector. Amongst other positions, he served as the Minister of Mines and Energy and was also the Premier of the province from 1979 to 1989.</b></p>

<i>“... a failure to pursue research over the last 30 years into B.C.’s geothermal resources has left BC Hydro without information about a resource that BC Hydro thinks may offer up to 700 megawatts of firm, economic power with low environmental costs.”</i><p></p>

<h3>powEARTHful 2.0</h3>
<p>BC currently has the opportunity to choose between a conventional, mega-dam project and a truly clean, stable and cost-competitive energy source.</p>
<p>You can help the BC Government make an informed decision so that generations to come are left with a legacy that everyone can be proud of. In the past, the geothermal potential of Canada has largely been ignored. However, as the Site C decision draws closer, Canada has the chance to finally demonstrate the feasibility of geothermal power.</p>

<h3><b>What is geothermal energy?</b></h3>
<p>Geothermal energy is a green source of reliable electricity and large scale direct use of (hot water) heat derived from the Earth.  It can help solve some of Canada’s greatest challenges, namely providing energy security, <a href=""http://www.cangea.ca/socio-economic-benefits.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">economic growth</a> and reducing our CO2 emissions. <a href=""http://www.cangea.ca/about-geothermal-energy.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Geothermal energy</a> is also the cleanest source of electricity and heat, using less land and producing fewer emissions than any other energy form.</p>
<p>Surmountable policy barriers in Canada are holding back the development of this renewable energy source that is already deployed in 73 countries.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1035714/files/20141121104244-Geothermal_RingofFire.jpg?1416595364"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Canada is the only country in the Ring of Fire not currently advancing geothermal</p>
<h3><b>Where will the funds go?</b></h3>
<b>We are asking you today to fund ""Geothermal Power: A Cost-Effective Alternative to Site C"". This <i>10 Point Assessment of the True Value of Geothermal Energy</i> finally sets the record straight, for British Columbia AND the rest of Canada.</b><p>While it has recently been demonstrated by CanGEA that BC has enough cost-competitive geothermal energy potential to power the province, <a href=""http://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/commentary/why-bc-s-future-should-be-geothermal-one"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/commentary/why-bc-s-future-should-be-geothermal-one"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/commentary/why-bc-s-future-should-be-geothermal-one"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/geothermal-alternatives-for-site-c-are-more-cost-effective-industry-group/article21784675/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">those claims are being disputed by BC Hydro and the BC Government in favour of the Site C mega-dam.</a></p>
<p>powEARTHful 2.0 Campaign proceeds will be directed towards our engineered resource estimate, financial modelling consulting costs, and the follow up required to act upon the report . <b>With the Site C decision expected in December</b>, it is imperative that our assessment is widely distributed, including follow-up briefings, to decision-makers, stakeholders and community-members before then.</p>

<h1 style=""font-size: 40px; line-height: 40px;"">What has the powEARTHful campaign been about? Wanting to see our country choose a clean energy alternative that can produce green power and grow local food in greenhouses.</h1>
<p>Developing our geothermal power and heat potential will create jobs, provide clean energy and tackle some of our greatest societal challenges. But, we are currently lacking government support.</p>
<h3 style=""color: teal;"">Let's Tell Our Government That Clean Energy is a Choice We Want to Have</h3>
<p>We want to choose a viable alternative that reduces our environmental footprint and boosts our economy. Together, we can make this a reality with geothermal electricity and heat. And, fortunately, we have an incredible amount of geothermal energy potential. We also have the expertise to be able to develop this clean, renewable source of power. The technology used for geothermal power production is globally established, and yet Canada is currently producing 0 MW of this power source. Yes, you read that right: ZERO. Zilch. None. Nada.</p>
<p><b>This is a Grassroots Campaign that will move our Clean Energy Industry Forward</b></p>
<p>Geothermal energy is a source of clean power and heat that provides renewable, competitively priced, around-the-clock energy. When we refer to geothermal energy, we are talking about geothermal <a href=""http://www.cangea.ca/geothermal-energy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">power and heat</a>, which is produced by accessing <b>heat stored deep inside the Earth</b>.</p>
<h2 style=""color: green;"">5,000 MW of Geothermal Power and Heat Can:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Be built with the smallest environmental footprint of any electricity and heat source</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Offer a renewable energy base load option for the power grid (power 5 million households and simultaneously heat 750,000 homes)</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Eliminate 25 million tonnes/yr of CO2 emissions (equal to the entire installed Alberta coal-fired power plant fleet)</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Create 9,000 full-time jobs (3x the number of jobs created by Canada's offshore oil industry in Newfoundland and Labrador)</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Contribute to Canada's northern sovereignty by solving high power, heat and food costs in northern, First Nation and remote communities</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Create economic diversity through the myriad <a href=""http://www.cangea.ca/geothermal-lindal-diagram/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">direct uses of geoheat</a> (greenhouse fruits &amp; vegetables, aquatic produce such as caviar &amp; fish, tourism via hot springs &amp; spas, and industrial processes like cement and pulp &amp; paper manufacturing)</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href=""http://www.cangea.ca/geothermal-fact-sheet/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and more...</a></b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote style=""color: #686868;""><i>""We were amazed to see [the] simplicity and economical attributes of direct use of geothermal when we had a tour of [a direct use run] farm, where they used geothermal for aquaculture, agriculture and for other day to day applications.""<br/>- <b>Piyush Bakane</b>, University of Nevada, GRC</i></blockquote>
<h2 style=""color: green;"">Why Aren't We Using It?</h2>
<p>Well, geothermal electricity <b>IS being used in 24 other countries</b>, and over 80 countries incorporate geothermal direct use of heat into their energy mix. Canada has what it takes to develop our own geothermal industry (the resource, the expertise, the demand). As recently as 2010, members of the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association (CanGEA) produced more than 20% of the world's geothermal energy- <b>just not in Canada</b>. With our strong natural resources experience, we have the expertise and industry technology that will get this industry going here at home!</p>
<p>However, government support for geothermal energy lags. Current government policies are severely insufficient; supporting policies are necessary to help the industry reach critical mass and be on an equal playing field with conventional energy sources as it is in other countries.</p>
<h2 style=""color: green;"">With You, We Can Execute Our Plan</h2>
<p>CanGEA is building an Industry Roadmap and Implementation Plan that will outline the necessary stepping-stones for Canadian policy makers and industry players to properly support our abundant and readily available geothermal opportunities. This Industry Roadmap is a series of <a href=""http://www.cangea.ca/reports-2013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">market reports</a>, resource favourability maps, databases and <a href=""http://www.cangea.ca/workshops/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">workshops</a> that highlight Canada's geothermal potential.</p>
<p>Government and CanGEA member dollars have already helped complete some of the Roadmap, but it isn't complete yet. We need to establish financial support to be able to finish it and really <b>influence government policy</b>. In order to influence policy, we need a policy team…</p>
<p>With your contribution, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hire a policy team that will lobby our government to put geothermal energy on a level playing field with other renewable and conventional energy sources</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Advance our Industry Roadmap</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Create local workshops to get information into the hands of the people who would benefit from geopower and heat while simultaneously training community organizers to keep the message alive</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Develop effective communication material that gets our message out in a clear voice</b></li>
</ul>
<p>… All of which will bring us that much closer to making geothermal energy a reality in Canada.</p>

<h2 style=""color: green;"">Economic Opportunities Created by Geothermal Power and Heat</h2>
<p>North America as a whole is endowed with vast geothermal resources. Mexico and the U.S. (which happens to be the world's #1 developer) are taking advantage of this gift.

<p>Geothermal power and heat needs to be able to compete in Canada's energy mix.

Once the geothermal energy industry has built up and can sustain itself, as it has in many other countries, these programs become less and less necessary. There is enough geothermal power and heat potential in Canada for the industry to flourish- it will not need to rely on these programs for long, but it does need them to start.</p>

</div></div>","Thank you to all that contributed to our followup powEARTHful 2.0 campaign! We were able to not only raise awareness of BC and Canada's geothermal potential, but were able to raise funds that went towards our Technical Briefing held on February 4, 2015 in Vancouver, BC.

The 2 campaigns may be over, but our mission certainly isn’t. With the $57,369 we’ve raised from these campaigns and via offline donations, we're breaking down policy barriers and raising public awareness of the opportunities of the geothermal power and heat industry in Canada.
In reality, the industry needs 10x our goal amount so that we can hire government relations professionals to assist us with our federal and provincial policy influencing efforts. This is vitally important because government relations professionals can get our message to those officials that will make a real difference, like what happens in every other industry such as wind, solar, oil & gas and mining. We’re trying to catch up and play at the same level as everyone else to get the same action.
We are now accepting contributions via the Donate PayPal Button at the bottom of our website as we prepare arguments on why Geothermal is a better option for the West than Site C Hydro or Coal Fired Power Plants.
Campaign Update:
Former Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Brian Peckford, has spoken out in favour of CanGEA’s recent report. He agrees with the recommendation that a moratorium be placed upon the Site C project, while alternatives such as geothermal energy are fully investigated. 
Mr. Peckford is often recognized for his instrumental role in the crafting of Newfoundland and Labrador’s successful energy sector. Amongst other positions, he served as the Minister of Mines and Energy and was also the Premier of the province from 1979 to 1989.
Read the letter here.Looking for a cost-effective, clean and flexible source of energy? It is right under your feet.
“... a failure to pursue research over the last 30 years into B.C.’s geothermal resources has left BC Hydro without information about a resource that BC Hydro thinks may offer up to 700 megawatts of firm, economic power with low environmental costs.”
- Site C Joint Review Panel, 2014
powEARTHful 2.0
BC currently has the opportunity to choose between a conventional, mega-dam project and a truly clean, stable and cost-competitive energy source.
You can help the BC Government make an informed decision so that generations to come are left with a legacy that everyone can be proud of. In the past, the geothermal potential of Canada has largely been ignored. However, as the Site C decision draws closer, Canada has the chance to finally demonstrate the feasibility of geothermal power.

Kinbasket Lake, BC - Site of Canoe Reach Geothermal Project
What is geothermal energy?
Geothermal energy is a green source of reliable electricity and large scale direct use of (hot water) heat derived from the Earth.  It can help solve some of Canada’s greatest challenges, namely providing energy security, economic growth and reducing our CO2 emissions. Geothermal energy is also the cleanest source of electricity and heat, using less land and producing fewer emissions than any other energy form.
Surmountable policy barriers in Canada are holding back the development of this renewable energy source that is already deployed in 73 countries.

Canada is the only country in the Ring of Fire not currently advancing geothermal
Where will the funds go?
We are asking you today to fund ""Geothermal Power: A Cost-Effective Alternative to Site C"". This 10 Point Assessment of the True Value of Geothermal Energy finally sets the record straight, for British Columbia AND the rest of Canada.While it has recently been demonstrated by CanGEA that BC has enough cost-competitive geothermal energy potential to power the province, those claims are being disputed by BC Hydro and the BC Government in favour of the Site C mega-dam.
powEARTHful 2.0 Campaign proceeds will be directed towards our engineered resource estimate, financial modelling consulting costs, and the follow up required to act upon the report . With the Site C decision expected in December, it is imperative that our assessment is widely distributed, including follow-up briefings, to decision-makers, stakeholders and community-members before then.

What has the powEARTHful campaign been about? Wanting to see our country choose a clean energy alternative that can produce green power and grow local food in greenhouses.
Developing our geothermal power and heat potential will create jobs, provide clean energy and tackle some of our greatest societal challenges. But, we are currently lacking government support.
Let's Tell Our Government That Clean Energy is a Choice We Want to Have
We want to choose a viable alternative that reduces our environmental footprint and boosts our economy. Together, we can make this a reality with geothermal electricity and heat. And, fortunately, we have an incredible amount of geothermal energy potential. We also have the expertise to be able to develop this clean, renewable source of power. The technology used for geothermal power production is globally established, and yet Canada is currently producing 0 MW of this power source. Yes, you read that right: ZERO. Zilch. None. Nada.
This is a Grassroots Campaign that will move our Clean Energy Industry Forward
Geothermal energy is a source of clean power and heat that provides renewable, competitively priced, around-the-clock energy. When we refer to geothermal energy, we are talking about geothermal power and heat, which is produced by accessing heat stored deep inside the Earth.
5,000 MW of Geothermal Power and Heat Can:

Be built with the smallest environmental footprint of any electricity and heat source


Offer a renewable energy base load option for the power grid (power 5 million households and simultaneously heat 750,000 homes)


Eliminate 25 million tonnes/yr of CO2 emissions (equal to the entire installed Alberta coal-fired power plant fleet)


Create 9,000 full-time jobs (3x the number of jobs created by Canada's offshore oil industry in Newfoundland and Labrador)


Contribute to Canada's northern sovereignty by solving high power, heat and food costs in northern, First Nation and remote communities


Create economic diversity through the myriad direct uses of geoheat (greenhouse fruits & vegetables, aquatic produce such as caviar & fish, tourism via hot springs & spas, and industrial processes like cement and pulp & paper manufacturing)


and more...

""We were amazed to see [the] simplicity and economical attributes of direct use of geothermal when we had a tour of [a direct use run] farm, where they used geothermal for aquaculture, agriculture and for other day to day applications.""- Piyush Bakane, University of Nevada, GRC
Why Aren't We Using It?
Well, geothermal electricity IS being used in 24 other countries, and over 80 countries incorporate geothermal direct use of heat into their energy mix. Canada has what it takes to develop our own geothermal industry (the resource, the expertise, the demand). As recently as 2010, members of the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association (CanGEA) produced more than 20% of the world's geothermal energy- just not in Canada. With our strong natural resources experience, we have the expertise and industry technology that will get this industry going here at home!
However, government support for geothermal energy lags. Current government policies are severely insufficient; supporting policies are necessary to help the industry reach critical mass and be on an equal playing field with conventional energy sources as it is in other countries.
With You, We Can Execute Our Plan
CanGEA is building an Industry Roadmap and Implementation Plan that will outline the necessary stepping-stones for Canadian policy makers and industry players to properly support our abundant and readily available geothermal opportunities. This Industry Roadmap is a series of market reports, resource favourability maps, databases and workshops that highlight Canada's geothermal potential.
Government and CanGEA member dollars have already helped complete some of the Roadmap, but it isn't complete yet. We need to establish financial support to be able to finish it and really influence government policy. In order to influence policy, we need a policy team…
With your contribution, we can:

Hire a policy team that will lobby our government to put geothermal energy on a level playing field with other renewable and conventional energy sources


Advance our Industry Roadmap


Create local workshops to get information into the hands of the people who would benefit from geopower and heat while simultaneously training community organizers to keep the message alive


Develop effective communication material that gets our message out in a clear voice

… All of which will bring us that much closer to making geothermal energy a reality in Canada.

""Canadians are internationally recognized for our natural resources and our ability to extract that resource. This Industry Roadmap is an amazing opportunity to engage our best geoscientists, engineers and business minds and show that with their knowledge and experience they can be an active partner in nurturing the geopower industry in Canada.""-  Craig Dunn, Chief Geologist, Borealis GeoPower


(Source: Up Here Magazine, Liard River Hot Springs, cc) Hot Springs: A geothermal direct use of heat application.

Your Impact:
Our actions have great impact. Your contribution will directly create full time jobs, support northern and remote communities, encourage local greenhouse farming, power millions of homes, generate economic growth and reduce our environmental footprint while facilitating the development of a clean energy technology that we can rely on.
Your donation is a vote for clean, sustainable geothermal power and heat in Canada.
When we are aware of a reliable renewable energy alternative that has a capacity comparable to or better than conventional energy sources like coal, we will be empowered to make informed choices for ourselves.""-  Julia Simone, Undergraduate, McGill University
Economic Opportunities Created by Geothermal Power and Heat
North America as a whole is endowed with vast geothermal resources. Mexico and the U.S. (which happens to be the world's #1 developer) are taking advantage of this gift. Canada is presently taking it for granted, even though it holds the potential to provide renewable and emissions-free baseload power. Another cool (or hot...) thing about geothermal energy is that you can use the water to heat a greenhouse or an aquaculture facility, or even clear the snow from your sidewalk!

Developing geothermal resources in remote communities and First Nations areas, both for power production and direct use, could offer an important means to diversify the economic base and potentially contribute the single largest capital investment in such areas, improving infrastructure and providing stable economic and social benefits for these communities.""  Titi Kunkel, University of Northern BC
(Source: Ram Power info@ram-power.com) Meager Creek, a potential geothermal power project in B.C

Canada's mining, oil and gas experience could play, and has played, a valuable part in the initial development of geothermal activities by Canadian players in Canada and overseas, particularly as it provides overlapping know-how and experience.""-  Islandsbanki, an investment bank specializing in geothermal energy
What the Industry Needs
With $50,000, we can start on the right path by hiring a Policy Advisor. In reality, the industry needs 10x that amount so that we can hire a lobbyist to assist us with our federal and provincial government policy influencing efforts. When we meet our first funding goal, we will be that much closer to geothermal power and heat being on track with the other well-funded and recognized renewable and conventional energy sources.

</h3><i><b>We're attempting the first citywide cigarette butt recycling 
program in America. </b></i><br/><b><b><b>We're a tiny 501c3 non-profit but together</b></b> with international recycling giant TerraCycle, we're able 
to turn Nashville's cigarette butts into industrial shipping pallets<b>. Didn't know you could recycle cigarette butts? It's possible, but we're going to need a little help from our friends.</b></b><br/><br/><h3>Why is this important?</h3>Hundreds of thousands of cigarette butts  land in local storm drains, street intersections, and sidewalks. Across
Middle Tennessee, our storm drains lead directly to 
rivers, creeks, and streams — so at the first rainfall, these butts end up in our water. Our 501c3 non-profit is stepping up with a unique idea that's committed to change!<b> </b><br/><p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><h3>What is this project all about?</h3>Your support will help us launch our Cigarette Waste Brigade, a city-wide effort to identify where cigarette butts are a problem, how they are entering our waterways and storm drains, and what the smartest solutions are to stop them. <br/><p></p><p>This is the same program for which the <b>NHL Nashville Predators</b> announced their participation and support.

Our program involves outreach to organizations, businesses, residents, 
schools and other important groups. <br/></p><p>The more this campaign achieves, the more initiatives we can 
take on across Davidson County. For example, Nashville has over 101 
formal
 neighborhood associations; our intent is to implement this program 
across them all. Our program is not about picking up cigarette butts all
 across town; instead we're engineering smart solutions and partnerships

 stretch goal will help us scale to the next level with community audits
 and outreach to large corporations that are unwittingly contributing to
 the problem. Corporate no-smoking policies indirectly promote smoking <i>off-property</i>
 where cigarette ash cans typically aren't found. The result means more 
cigarette butts in our streets, gutters and water. By creating partnerships with corporate 
leadership and facilities managers, we can develop systems to reduce this problem. Our stretch goal will also cover the costs of 
some ash cans for specific public areas that are neglected.</p><p></p><h3>What you get<br/>

Let's fix this!
We're attempting the first citywide cigarette butt recycling 
program in America. We're a tiny 501c3 non-profit but together with international recycling giant TerraCycle, we're able 
to turn Nashville's cigarette butts into industrial shipping pallets. Didn't know you could recycle cigarette butts? It's possible, but we're going to need a little help from our friends.Why is this important?Hundreds of thousands of cigarette butts  land in local storm drains, street intersections, and sidewalks. Across
Middle Tennessee, our storm drains lead directly to 
rivers, creeks, and streams — so at the first rainfall, these butts end up in our water. Our 501c3 non-profit is stepping up with a unique idea that's committed to change! 

What is this project all about?Your support will help us launch our Cigarette Waste Brigade, a city-wide effort to identify where cigarette butts are a problem, how they are entering our waterways and storm drains, and what the smartest solutions are to stop them. This is the same program for which the NHL Nashville Predators announced their participation and support. You can read about that here. Other key community participation will be announced soon from Nashville's most iconic entities. Our program involves outreach to organizations, businesses, residents, 
schools and other important groups. The more this campaign achieves, the more initiatives we can 
take on across Davidson County. For example, Nashville has over 101 
formal
 neighborhood associations; our intent is to implement this program 
across them all. Our program is not about picking up cigarette butts all
 across town; instead we're engineering smart solutions and partnerships
 before they even reach the ground.• Belle Meade • Bellevue • Belmont • Berryhill • Brentwood • 
Cleveland Park •
 Crieve Hall •  Donelson • Downtown Urban District • East Nashville • 
Edgehill • Germantown
 • Green Hills • The Gulch • Hermitage • Hillsboro Village • Hillwood • 
Inglewood • Madison • Oak Hill • Old Hickory • Richland • Sylvan Park • 
12South • and many more neighborhoods.Fundraising GoalsOur Initial Goal: $7,000As of March 1, we are halfway to our first goal. Thank you to all who have contributed and helped get the word out! This amount will help us afford specific tangibles including a program logo, a program website, marketing materials, and an initial design of our community footprint and program outreach.Our Stretch Goal:  $10,000Our
 stretch goal will help us scale to the next level with community audits
 and outreach to large corporations that are unwittingly contributing to
 the problem. Corporate no-smoking policies indirectly promote smoking off-property
 where cigarette ash cans typically aren't found. The result means more 
cigarette butts in our streets, gutters and water. By creating partnerships with corporate 
leadership and facilities managers, we can develop systems to reduce this problem. Our stretch goal will also cover the costs of 
some ash cans for specific public areas that are neglected.What you get
Awesome cool stuff from our corporate campaign supporters!If you don't need (or want) an incentive to get involved, please use the top 
funding category we've called ""Open Donation"" and set your own amount. The default box currently says $1, but simply change your amount at checkout.But take a look at the incentives several generous businesses  have tossed in to help our campaign.

<b><br/>Break the Ice and Open This Dialogue!</b><br/>Inuit from Hudson Bay have been raising their concerns about impacts of hydroelectricity on sea ice for over 20 years, but these remain unaddressed. While in New York, we'll be working with the Waterkeeper Alliance and inviting other organizations, experts and policy makers to round table discussion and public panels to determine effective strategies for addressing these issues. The main topics will include open access to river flow data and basic water management from hydroelectric reservoirs.<br/><br/>To raise the profile of this issue, gain support, and get the attention of decision makers, we are looking to crowd fund an advertisement in the New York Times that connects New Yorkers with where their electricity comes from, and how this affects sea ice ecosystems in Hudson Bay. Even a small ad could have a big impact.<br/><br/><b>Stay tuned for a draft of the Advertisement!</b><br/><i><br/></i><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/125049/files/20131010052546-research_banner.jpg?1381407946"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><b><i>The Issue: Your Light Switch Turns on Rivers!</i></b><br/>Did you know that turning on a light switch in places like Quebec or New York directly impacts Arctic sea ice ecosystems? You may have thought electric heat was clean and green, but if you use hydroelectric power in eastern North America, you may be contributing to reversing the seasonality of rivers. Rivers naturally peak in the spring when the snow melts, but winter peaks in hydroelectricity demands divert the flow of rivers into James and Hudson Bay at the wrong time of year, with big consequences for sea ice ecosystems. Because freshwater freezes quicker and at warmer temperatures than sea water, extensive areas of Hudson Bay can suddenly freeze trapping vulnerable Arctic wildlife such as the birds and whales featured in our video. Freshwater from Hudson Bay also affects larger scale processes like ocean circulation and climate in the North Atlantic, so this is a global issue. <br/></p>

this critical point in time. New York and New England states are currently seeking to increase hydroelectricity from eastern Canada. Help us raise awareness about the communities that are being affected at the other end of the lines, and address these long standing isues now before increasing imports and making the problem worse. We have a series
 of meetings underway with experts and policy makers that can help make
 this happen. We'll be bringing the results of these meetings to the 
public during panel discussions following film screenings at the Quad Cinema after the 7:15 PM screenings on Nov 8th, 
9th and 10th. <br/><br/>This will involve: <br/>1. Inuit and researchers from Hudson Bay involved in Community Based Research and in making our award winning film <a href=""http://www.peopleofafeather.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">People of a Feather</a><br/>
2. Inuit and the Grand (Churchill) Riverkeeper from Labrador, where construction is just beginning on the Muskrat Falls Hydroelectric Project<br/>3. Members of the Waterkeeper Alliance including the Hudson Riverkeepers. <br/>4. Members of other NYC organizations including experts and policy makers that can help with implementing solutions. <span><span>We are also currently working on getting organizations in Quebec involved. </span>Stay tuned for details!<br/></span></p>

<p><i>Please Note: Funding from this campaign is not for the release of our film People of a Feather, we've already got that covered with our distributor First Run Features. The objective of this campaign is to move from sharing Knowledge into Action with the Waterkeeper Alliance to address these issues in New York City and implement policy for open access to river flow data and basic water management from hydroelectric reservoirs.<br/><br/>People of a Feather has been produced and distributed on a not-for-profit basis through the Arctic Eider Society.

<h2>Knowledge to Action</h2>
<b><i>Help Implement Solutions that work with Sea Ice </i></b><br/>We are
working with the Waterkeeper Alliance and other groups of experts and policy makers towards two simple and
achievable solutions:<span><span>
<p>1. <b>Open
Access</b>. The hydroelectric industry in Eastern Canada is very 
secretive
about their current water management techniques and data on river flows.
 This basic information is needed by communities, government and 
stakeholders to understand cumulative impacts on sea ice ecosystems, and
 to establish policies and thresholds that can mitigate these impacts. 
Conditions for construction of recent dams on the Rupert River in 2010 required assesment of cumulative impacts, but this has still not been addressed. As publicly owned companies, access
to this information should mandatory, and we need your help to change 
this NOW. <i>This would be a major accomplishment in moving forward on these issues.  </i>
</p>
<p>2. <b>Implement
Basic Water Management Principles. </b>Right now, the hydroelectric 
industry controls river flow based on electricity demands without any 
oversight or consideration of environmental impacts. Basic water
management principles need to be adopted for hydroelectric projects in
northern Canada in order to mitigate impacts of electricity spikes on 
river
flow regimes. Existing infrastructure and technologies can be used for
energy storage and distribution allowing the delivery of power during 
peak demands, without releasing extensive plumes of reservoir water onto
 sea
ice ecosystems in mid-winter. Water management principles are required 
by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for dams in the United States,
 and should be a requirement for imports
from Canada too. This should have happened over 20 years ago, and we 
need your help
to change it NOW</p>

He has also worked with our charity at events, raising awareness and conducting media interviews. As a result of his involvement with the project, he has become inspired to become the first Inuit wildlife officer in his hometown of Sanikiluaq, and has recently completed the final stages of his training at the Nunavut Arctic College as “Student of the Year” in 2013. <br/><p><br/><b>Lucassie Arragutainaq </b>works for the municipality of Sanikiluaq managing wildlife and environmental programs. He has led major collaborative initiatives in Hudson Bay for over 20 years, including Voices from the Bay, a compendium of Inuit and Cree knowledge on these impacts from 28 communities. He facilitates locally based monitoring programs and has extensive background with research, wildlife and impacts of hydroelectric developments on sea ice ecosystems. <br/><br/><b>Dinah Kavik</b> (B.Ed., M.Ed) helped write and coordinate the film including involvement of school culture programs, interviewing elders and translation. She is an exceptional communicator and an in-depth source of Inuit knowledge on these issues due to her work with the environment committee and Voices from the Bay. <br/><br/><b>Johnny Kudluarok</b> has worked closely with the team for over a decade through his involvement as a guide and facilitator of community based research and monitoring programs. He was the lead production assistant and co-developer of People of a Feather, is on our board of directors, and has been involved in outreach activities in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver. <br/><br/>

Our charity has funds to cover one of these individuals, our researchers and director are coming on their own bill. We need your help to bring these individuals from Hudson Bay and to involve Inuit from Labrador, where new hydroelectric dams are being built that could have similar impacts on the sea ice ecosystems they rely on. These issues cross jurisdictional boundaries, and New York is the biggest importer of hydroelectricity, so this is where and when we are going to be able to unite and make change happen!<br/>     <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/110290/files/20131003043739-impacts_solutions_banner.jpg?1380800259"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Additional Background and Knowledge</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hydroelectricity projects set new records during the cold winter of 2013, when
record amounts of water from reservoirs
were dumped onto critical sea ice habitats in the process of generating
electricity to keep up with demands for electric heat on the eastern seaboard. Another cold winter is predicted this year. Inuit have been working for over 30 years to address marine impacts of
winter hydroelectricity demands which now reverse the seasonal flow of rivers
into the Hudson Bay inland sea. <span>With the help of
individuals in New York like Robert Kennedy Jr., Inuit and Cree communities were
able to stop development of the Great Whale River hydroelectric project in the
early 1990s. However, this only delayed the problem as new diversions and dams were
completed in Northern Quebec in 2010. New developments are currently underway
in Labrador. <br/></span></p>
<p><span> Despite over 30 years of raising these issues, Inuit
concerns about cumulative impacts on sea ice ecosystems remain unaddressed.
Dams in Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba have already been built, but water
management techniques and new energy storage and distribution policies could
address this issue, particularly during mid-winter peak spikes in electricity
demand. Inuit in Labrador are currently involved in legal disputes as construction is just beginning on the Lower Churchill River Musktrat Falls Dam. The proposed Hudson-Champlaign Power Express is close to being approved which would increase imports and require new dams. Exports to New York are key economic component of these hydroelectric mega-projects, and so New York has a big say in how these dams are built and operated. It's time to rejuvenate grass roots in New York and address this issue! <i>If New Yorkers required open access to hydrological data and basic water management techniques as a policy for Canadian hydroelectricity imports, the issue would be finally addressed</i>. Lets make it happen!</span></p>

<b>Brisons la glace et ouvrons le dialogue !</b><b>
</b><p>Les Inuits de la Baie d’Hudson tentent depuis 20 ans de communiquer
leurs inquiétudes à propos des impacts de l’hydroélectricité, mais leurs appels
sont demeurés sans réponse. Lorsque nous serons à New York, nous travaillerons
de concert avec la Waterkeeper Alliance et convierons d’autres organismes,
experts et décideurs à notre table de discussion ;  nous
encouragerons également les concertations publiques, afin d’établir des
stratégies efficaces pour traiter de ces questions. Les principaux sujets
abordés seront notamment l’accèsibilité aux données sur le débit des cours

hydroélectriques.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Afin d’accroître la visibilité de cette cause, de trouver du soutien et
d’attirer l’attention des décideurs, nous comptons sur la collectivité pour
nous aider à financer une publicité dans le New York Times. Une telle présence

<p><b><i>Le problème : Votre
interrupteur d’éclairage allume les rivières ! </i></b></p>
<p>Saviez-vous que le fait d’actionner un
interrupteur d’éclairage au Québec ou à New York à un impact direct sur les
écosystèmes de la banquise en Arctique ? Vous pensiez peut-être que
l’hydroélectricité était une énergie propre et verte, mais si vous utilisez
cette source d’énergie dans l’Est de l’Amérique du Nord, vous contribuez
probablement à l’inversion de la saisonnalité des cours d’eau. De façon
naturelle, les cours d’eau se gonflent au printemps lors de la fonte des
neiges ; par contre, les crues hivernales, causées par la forte demande en
hydroélectricité, détournent le flux des rivières dans la Baie James et la Baie
d’Hudson au mauvais moment de l’année, ce qui a de graves conséquences sur les
écosystèmes de la banquise. Étant donné que l’eau douce gèle plus rapidement et
à des températures plus douces que l’eau de mer, des zones beaucoup plus vastes
de la Baie d’Hudson peuvent se solidifier soudainement, piégeant dans la glace
la faune vulnérable de l’Arctique, comme les oiseaux et les baleines, tels que
ceux montrés dans notre film. L’eau douce provenant de la Baie d’Hudson affecte
également sur les mécanismes à plus grande échelle, comme les courants marins
et le climat dans l’Atlantique Nord. Il s’agit donc d’un problème grave à
l’échelle mondiale. <br/></p>

Il pousse son 
commentaire éditorial. Mais on en retient bien davantage un appel des 
sens qui se transpose de l’écran au spectateur avec une acuité rarement 
vue.
                            <p>Il y a les images. 
Magiques, lumineuses, parfois troublantes. Ces envolées majestueuses des
 eiders dans des cadrages très serrés. Leurs plongées olympiques sous 
l’eau pour débusquer oursins et moules. Il y a les sons. Purs, crus, 
cristallins. Des pas sur la neige qui craque. Les cris des animaux 
déchirant les grandes étendues neigeuses. Il y a le goût, sauvage, de la
 viande de phoque et d’eider sous la langue.</p>
<p>Ce film est un 
poème. Littéralement. Et comme il traite avec originalité d’un sujet 
très rarement vu au grand écran, on peut difficilement demander mieux. 
Long métrage documentaire, AU GRÉ DE LA PLUME ARCTIQUE nous amène dans 
les îles Belcher, où des Innus vivent de chasse et de pêche depuis des 
temps ancestraux. Le bout du monde, version feuille d’érable. Mais 
voilà. Depuis quelques décennies, la construction de grands barrages 
hydroélectriques et le rejet d’eau des réservoirs dans la baie d’Hudson 
adoucissent ses eaux en plus de ralentir les courants. Avec pour 
conséquences que les polynies, petites étendues d’eau qui ne gèlent pas 
sur la banquise et où se rassemblent les eiders pour survivre, ont 
tendance à se refermer, ce qui les force à migrer. Les Innus en perdent 
leur latin. Ils disent qu’on a renversé les saisons. «La glace est plus 
difficile à comprendre», dit l’un d’eux.</p>
<p>Cela dit, il ne 
faut pas s’arrêter seulement à l’aspect écologiste du film. AU GRÉ DE LA
 PLUME ARCTIQUE nous frappe bien davantage par son équilibre entre homme
 et nature, entre traditions anciennes et modernisme, entre silences et 
paroles. Le tout, d’une saison à l’autre, du jour à la nuit, sous des 
paysages grandioses.""</p>

<p>Nous travaillons
de paire avec la Waterkeeper Alliance et d’autres groupes d’experts et de
décideurs pour l’obtention de deux solutions simples et réalisables :<span>  </span></p>
<p>1. <b>Un
accès libre</b>. L’industrie hydroélectrique dans le Nord du Canada demeure
très discrète sur leurs techniques actuelles de gestion de l’eau et sur le
débit des rivières. Ces informations sont nécessaires aux communautés, aux
gouvernements et à toutes les autres parties concernées pour comprendre les
effets néfastes sur les écosystèmes de la banquise, afin d’établir des règles
et des limites pouvant atténuer ces impacts. Comme c’est le cas pour les
sociétés publiques, ces informations devraient obligatoirement être accessibles
pour tous. Nous avons besoin de votre aide pour que cela change MAINTENANT. <i>Même si c’était tout ce que nous pouvions
accomplir pour l’instant, cela représenterait un pas de géant dans la bonne
direction.</i><span>  </span></p>
<p>2. <b>Implantation
de stratégies élémentaires de gestion de l’eau. </b>En ce moment, l’industrie
hydrolectrique contrôle le débit des rivières en fonction de la demande en
électricité sans contrôle ni considération quant aux impacts sur
l’environnement. Nous avons besoin que des stratégies élémentaires de gestion
de l’eau soient adoptées pour tous les projets hydroélectriques dans le Nord du
Canada, afin de minimiser les effets néfastes qu’entraînent les hausses de la
demande en électricité (surtout en période de pointe) sur le cours des rivières.
Des technologies et des infrastructures déjà existantes pourraient être
utilisées pour le stockage et la distribution d’énergie, ce qui permettrait de
fournir l’énergie supplémentaire nécessaire en période de pointe, sans que de
grandes quantités d’eau douce ne soient libérées dans les écosystèmes fragiles
de la banquise en hiver. Des stratégies de gestion de l’eau sont exigées par la
<i>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</i>
pour chaque barrage aux États-Unis, et devraient l’être également pour les
importations d’électricité en provenance du Canada. Cela aurait dû être fait il
y a plus de 20 ans et nous avons besoin de votre aide pour que ça change
MAINTENANT.</p>

<p><b>Daniel Qavvik</b> est le jeune premier en vedette dans notre film <i>People
of a Feather</i>. Il a également participé à certains de nos évènements
caritatifs, conscientisant le public et dirigeant les entrevues avec les
médias. Son implication dans le projet lui a inspiré de devenir le premier
agent de protection de la faune Inuit, dans son village natal de Sanikiluaq. Il
a également complété les dernières étapes de son programme au Nunavut Arctic
College, remportant le titre d’« étudiant de l’année » pour 2013.</p>
<p><b>Lucassie

pour la municipalité de Sanikiluaq en gestion de la faune et pour des
programmes environnementaux. Il a dirigé plusieurs initiatives de collaboration
dans la Baie d’Hudson pendant plus de 20 ans, incluant <i>Voices from the Bay</i>, un recueil compilant les connaissances de 28
communautés Inuit et Cries à propos de ces impacts. Il a su favoriser la tenue
de programmes de surveillance locaux et possède une vaste expérience de la
faune, de la recherche et des effets néfastes du développement hydroélectrique
sur les écosystèmes de la banquise.</p>

également les Inuits du Labrador, où de nouveaux barrages hydroélectriques sont
construits et pourraient avoir les mêmes effets dévastateurs sur l’écosystème
de la banquise dont ils dépendent. Ces questions vont plus loin que les limites

<h3><b>Historique et contexte actuel</b></h3>
<p>Les
projets hydroélectriques ont battu de nouveaux records lors de l’hiver très
froid de 2013, alors que des quantités jamais égalées d’eaux provenant des
réservoirs ont été rejetées dans les habitats de la banquise, déjà dans un état
critique, dans le processus de génération d’électricité pour répondre à la
demande accrue en provenance de la côte est. On s’attend cette année encore à
un hiver très froid. Les Inuits travaillent depuis 30 ans à contrer les effets
néfastes de la demande accrue en électricité en hiver sur la vie marine, qui
aujourd’hui renversent littéralement le débit normal des rivières en cette
saison dans la mer intérieure de la Baie d’Hudson. Avec l’aide de personnalités
à New York comme Robert Kennedy Jr., les communautés Inuits et Cries ont été en
mesure de stopper le développement du projet hydroélectrique de Grande-Baleine
au début des années 90. Toutefois, cela n’a que relayé le problème à plus tard,
car de nouveaux projets de détournements et de barrages ont été complétés dans
le Nord du Québec en 2010. De nouveaux développements sont actuellement en
cours au Labrador.</p>
<p>Malgré 30
ans d’efforts pour mettre de l’avant ces questions graves, les préoccupations
des Inuits à propos des effets cumulatifs sur les écosystèmes restent sans
réponses. Des barrages ont déjà été construits au Québec, en Ontario et au
Manitoba, mais les stratégies de gestion de l’eau et les nouvelles politiques
de stockage et de distribution d’énergie pourraient être la solution à ce problème,
particulièrement durant l’hiver, pendant les périodes de pointe où la demande
en électricité est accrue. Les Inuits du Labrador sont présentement impliqués
dans un conflit juridique à propos du projet de barrage de Muskrat Falls, dans
le Bas-Churchill. Les exportations vers New York sont le facteur<span>  économique clé de ces méga-projets
hydroélectriques ; les New Yorkais ont donc leur mot à dire quant à la
manière dont ces barrages sont construits et exploités. Il est temps de secouer
la population de la grosse pomme et de résoudre enfin le problème ! <i>Si les New Yorkais exigent un libre accès
aux données hydrologiques et des statégies élémentaires de gestion de l’eau
comme une condition à l’importation d’électricité provenant du Canada, ce
problème serait définitivement réglé. </i>Mettons tout en oeuvre pour y arriver
! </span></p>

People of a Feather opens at the Quad Cinema in Manhattan, Nov 8-14, 2013!! Get your Tickets Here!



You Made it Happen! We reached our goal! Though
 the Indiegogo campaign is over, you can still contribute to our efforts in New York and other Knowledge to Action programs through our charity The Arctic Eider Society (click here). We'll even give you the same perks listed here!Thank you for helping us turn Knowledge shared through our award winning film People of a Feather into Action
 with the Waterkeeper Alliance to address these issues in New York City!
 Stay tuned for the results of the meeting on Nov 6th and keep an eye out for us in 
the New York Times this Sunday Nov 3rd! And that is just the beginning of what you're helping accomplish! Stay Tuned!



You can also catch us at the New School in New York City on Monday Nov 4th for a public seminar on behind the scenes of Environemental Justice, Community Based Research and Filmmaking in the Canadian Arctic! Details & RSVP Here


Campaign Description (Fundraising on indiegogo for this campaign finished Oct 30, 2013 but the work is just beginning! Visit our website at www.arcticeider.com for more details on our other charitable programs)What started out as a film about a unique Inuit culture that relies on feathers, has turned into a global campaign to address impacts of hydroelectric dams on critical sea ice habitats. New York is the largest importer of Canadian hydroelectricity and current plans to increase these imports need to consider impacts on Inuit and wildlife in Hudson Bay and Labrador. Help bring these individuals from the Arctic to New York City!In addition to showing the film, we hope to raise enough to help Inuit 
from Hudson Bay and Labrador to participate in screenings and attend round table meetings and 
public forums hosted by the Waterkeeper Alliance. Providing the 
opportunity to share their concerns first hand and engaging them in this
 timely international dialogue could have a big impact! Help us get them there!Daniel Qavvik is the lead youth character in People of a Feather and the Nunavut Arctic College's ""Student of the Year"" for 2013. Lucassie, Dinah and Johnny are long term experts on these issues. It
 costs $2,500 just for airfare from Hudson Bay to New York, but now Air 
Inuit will match your donations by providing a 75% discount! We're getting close to raising enough to bring them all to New York City to share how these hydroelectric dams affect their families and community. Help us raise awareness about this issue and work towards solutions!
Break the Ice and Open This Dialogue!Inuit from Hudson Bay have been raising their concerns about impacts of hydroelectricity on sea ice for over 20 years, but these remain unaddressed. While in New York, we'll be working with the Waterkeeper Alliance and inviting other organizations, experts and policy makers to round table discussion and public panels to determine effective strategies for addressing these issues. The main topics will include open access to river flow data and basic water management from hydroelectric reservoirs.To raise the profile of this issue, gain support, and get the attention of decision makers, we are looking to crowd fund an advertisement in the New York Times that connects New Yorkers with where their electricity comes from, and how this affects sea ice ecosystems in Hudson Bay. Even a small ad could have a big impact.Stay tuned for a draft of the Advertisement!
The Issue: Your Light Switch Turns on Rivers!Did you know that turning on a light switch in places like Quebec or New York directly impacts Arctic sea ice ecosystems? You may have thought electric heat was clean and green, but if you use hydroelectric power in eastern North America, you may be contributing to reversing the seasonality of rivers. Rivers naturally peak in the spring when the snow melts, but winter peaks in hydroelectricity demands divert the flow of rivers into James and Hudson Bay at the wrong time of year, with big consequences for sea ice ecosystems. Because freshwater freezes quicker and at warmer temperatures than sea water, extensive areas of Hudson Bay can suddenly freeze trapping vulnerable Arctic wildlife such as the birds and whales featured in our video. Freshwater from Hudson Bay also affects larger scale processes like ocean circulation and climate in the North Atlantic, so this is a global issue. 
How your contribution will help:
Implementing Solutions:Your support will facilitate our campaign
 to implement solutions. We've been building momentum for years, making 
the film, conducting research, developing solutions, and all towards 
this critical point in time. New York and New England states are currently seeking to increase hydroelectricity from eastern Canada. Help us raise awareness about the communities that are being affected at the other end of the lines, and address these long standing isues now before increasing imports and making the problem worse. We have a series
 of meetings underway with experts and policy makers that can help make
 this happen. We'll be bringing the results of these meetings to the 
public during panel discussions following film screenings at the Quad Cinema after the 7:15 PM screenings on Nov 8th, 
9th and 10th. This will involve: 1. Inuit and researchers from Hudson Bay involved in Community Based Research and in making our award winning film People of a Feather
2. Inuit and the Grand (Churchill) Riverkeeper from Labrador, where construction is just beginning on the Muskrat Falls Hydroelectric Project3. Members of the Waterkeeper Alliance including the Hudson Riverkeepers. 4. Members of other NYC organizations including experts and policy makers that can help with implementing solutions. We are also currently working on getting organizations in Quebec involved. Stay tuned for details!

Read on to find out more about:1. Our award winning film People of a Feather opening in New York City2. What you'll help us accomplish3. Ways you can help, and great perks for contributing, including DVDs, VIP passes, your name in the credits on the big screening, soapstone carvings, meetings with your sponsored guest and film team, even a luxurious hand made eider down duvet from Sanikiluaq that will reduce your consumption of hydroelectricity!

Please Note: Funding from this campaign is not for the release of our film People of a Feather, we've already got that covered with our distributor First Run Features. The objective of this campaign is to move from sharing Knowledge into Action with the Waterkeeper Alliance to address these issues in New York City and implement policy for open access to river flow data and basic water management from hydroelectric reservoirs.People of a Feather has been produced and distributed on a not-for-profit basis through the Arctic Eider Society. We are a registered Canadian charity. See details below for Canada/US tax receipts.
Knowledge to Action
Help Implement Solutions that work with Sea Ice We are
working with the Waterkeeper Alliance and other groups of experts and policy makers towards two simple and
achievable solutions:
1. Open
Access. The hydroelectric industry in Eastern Canada is very 
secretive
about their current water management techniques and data on river flows.
 This basic information is needed by communities, government and 
stakeholders to understand cumulative impacts on sea ice ecosystems, and
 to establish policies and thresholds that can mitigate these impacts. 
Conditions for construction of recent dams on the Rupert River in 2010 required assesment of cumulative impacts, but this has still not been addressed. As publicly owned companies, access
to this information should mandatory, and we need your help to change 
this NOW. This would be a major accomplishment in moving forward on these issues.  

2. Implement
Basic Water Management Principles. Right now, the hydroelectric 
industry controls river flow based on electricity demands without any 
oversight or consideration of environmental impacts. Basic water
management principles need to be adopted for hydroelectric projects in
northern Canada in order to mitigate impacts of electricity spikes on 
river
flow regimes. Existing infrastructure and technologies can be used for
energy storage and distribution allowing the delivery of power during 
peak demands, without releasing extensive plumes of reservoir water onto
 sea
ice ecosystems in mid-winter. Water management principles are required 
by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for dams in the United States,
 and should be a requirement for imports
from Canada too. This should have happened over 20 years ago, and we 
need your help
to change it NOW
WHO YOU CAN HELP BRING TO NEW YORKDaniel Qavvik is the lead youth featured in People of a Feather. He has also worked with our charity at events, raising awareness and conducting media interviews. As a result of his involvement with the project, he has become inspired to become the first Inuit wildlife officer in his hometown of Sanikiluaq, and has recently completed the final stages of his training at the Nunavut Arctic College as “Student of the Year” in 2013. Lucassie Arragutainaq works for the municipality of Sanikiluaq managing wildlife and environmental programs. He has led major collaborative initiatives in Hudson Bay for over 20 years, including Voices from the Bay, a compendium of Inuit and Cree knowledge on these impacts from 28 communities. He facilitates locally based monitoring programs and has extensive background with research, wildlife and impacts of hydroelectric developments on sea ice ecosystems. Dinah Kavik (B.Ed., M.Ed) helped write and coordinate the film including involvement of school culture programs, interviewing elders and translation. She is an exceptional communicator and an in-depth source of Inuit knowledge on these issues due to her work with the environment committee and Voices from the Bay. Johnny Kudluarok has worked closely with the team for over a decade through his involvement as a guide and facilitator of community based research and monitoring programs. He was the lead production assistant and co-developer of People of a Feather, is on our board of directors, and has been involved in outreach activities in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver. 

Our charity has funds to cover one of these individuals, our researchers and director are coming on their own bill. We need your help to bring these individuals from Hudson Bay and to involve Inuit from Labrador, where new hydroelectric dams are being built that could have similar impacts on the sea ice ecosystems they rely on. These issues cross jurisdictional boundaries, and New York is the biggest importer of hydroelectricity, so this is where and when we are going to be able to unite and make change happen!     

Additional Background and Knowledge




Hydroelectricity projects set new records during the cold winter of 2013, when
record amounts of water from reservoirs
were dumped onto critical sea ice habitats in the process of generating
electricity to keep up with demands for electric heat on the eastern seaboard. Another cold winter is predicted this year. Inuit have been working for over 30 years to address marine impacts of
winter hydroelectricity demands which now reverse the seasonal flow of rivers
into the Hudson Bay inland sea. With the help of
individuals in New York like Robert Kennedy Jr., Inuit and Cree communities were
able to stop development of the Great Whale River hydroelectric project in the
early 1990s. However, this only delayed the problem as new diversions and dams were
completed in Northern Quebec in 2010. New developments are currently underway
in Labrador. 
 Despite over 30 years of raising these issues, Inuit
concerns about cumulative impacts on sea ice ecosystems remain unaddressed.
Dams in Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba have already been built, but water
management techniques and new energy storage and distribution policies could
address this issue, particularly during mid-winter peak spikes in electricity
demand. Inuit in Labrador are currently involved in legal disputes as construction is just beginning on the Lower Churchill River Musktrat Falls Dam. The proposed Hudson-Champlaign Power Express is close to being approved which would increase imports and require new dams. Exports to New York are key economic component of these hydroelectric mega-projects, and so New York has a big say in how these dams are built and operated. It's time to rejuvenate grass roots in New York and address this issue! If New Yorkers required open access to hydrological data and basic water management techniques as a policy for Canadian hydroelectricity imports, the issue would be finally addressed. Lets make it happen!

Version FrançaisCe qui avait commencé comme un film à propos d’une culture inuite
unique, dans laquelle les plumes ont une place très importance, s’est
transformé en campagne internationale pour la lutte contre les effets des
projets hydroélectriques sur les habitats essentiels de la banquise. La ville
de New York étant le plus grand importateur d’hydroélectricité canadienne, elle
est notre meilleure chance de résoudre ce problème. Nous avons un plan, et avec
votre aide, nous pouvons y arriver ! 


Aidez-nous à transformer le savoir
partagé par notre film primé  People of a Feather / Au gré de la plume Arctique, en action à New York, avec l’aide de la
Waterkeeper Alliance, afin de trouver une solution à ces problèmes !
Aidez-nous à faire voyager les gens de
l’Arctique jusqu’à New York !


Il en coûte 2 500 $ uniquement pour le transport aérien entre
la Baie d’Hudson et New York. Notre objectif est d’amasser les fonds suffisants
pour aider les Inuits de la Baie d’Hudson et du Labrador à venir assister aux réunions,
tables rondes et forums qui seront tenus par la Waterkeeper  Alliance. Ce sera pour eux une occasion
unique de venir témoigner en personne de leurs préoccupations, et nous croyons
que s’ils participent eux-mêmes à ce dialogue international, ils seront la clé
de notre succès ! 
Daniel Qavvik, qui est le plus jeune personnage principal de People
of a Feather, s’est vu décerner le titre d’« étudiant de l’année
2013 » au Nunavut Arctic College. Nous n’avons besoin que de
1 500 $ supplémentaires pour le faire venir de sa résidence à
Sanikiluaq à New York, où il pourra partager son histoire avec les décideurs et
le public, et les informer sur les impacts néfastes des projets
hydroélectriques sur sa famille et sa communauté. Aidez-nous à l’y envoyer !
Aidez-nous à sensibiliser les gens à cette cause
et à trouver des solutions !

Brisons la glace et ouvrons le dialogue !
Les Inuits de la Baie d’Hudson tentent depuis 20 ans de communiquer
leurs inquiétudes à propos des impacts de l’hydroélectricité, mais leurs appels
sont demeurés sans réponse. Lorsque nous serons à New York, nous travaillerons
de concert avec la Waterkeeper Alliance et convierons d’autres organismes,
experts et décideurs à notre table de discussion ;  nous
encouragerons également les concertations publiques, afin d’établir des
stratégies efficaces pour traiter de ces questions. Les principaux sujets
abordés seront notamment l’accèsibilité aux données sur le débit des cours
d’eau, ainsi que les statégies élémentaires de gestion de l’eau des réservoirs
hydroélectriques.  
Afin d’accroître la visibilité de cette cause, de trouver du soutien et
d’attirer l’attention des décideurs, nous comptons sur la collectivité pour
nous aider à financer une publicité dans le New York Times. Une telle présence
médiatique nous assurerait d’informer les New Yorkais sur la provenance de leur
électricité, et de la façon dont elle affecte les écosystèmes nordiques liés à
la banquise dans la Baie d’Hudson. Même une petite publicité peut avoir un
impact majeur.
Restez à l’écoute pour un projet de
publicité ! 

Le problème : Votre
interrupteur d’éclairage allume les rivières ! 
Saviez-vous que le fait d’actionner un
interrupteur d’éclairage au Québec ou à New York à un impact direct sur les
écosystèmes de la banquise en Arctique ? Vous pensiez peut-être que
l’hydroélectricité était une énergie propre et verte, mais si vous utilisez
cette source d’énergie dans l’Est de l’Amérique du Nord, vous contribuez
probablement à l’inversion de la saisonnalité des cours d’eau. De façon
naturelle, les cours d’eau se gonflent au printemps lors de la fonte des
neiges ; par contre, les crues hivernales, causées par la forte demande en
hydroélectricité, détournent le flux des rivières dans la Baie James et la Baie
d’Hudson au mauvais moment de l’année, ce qui a de graves conséquences sur les
écosystèmes de la banquise. Étant donné que l’eau douce gèle plus rapidement et
à des températures plus douces que l’eau de mer, des zones beaucoup plus vastes
de la Baie d’Hudson peuvent se solidifier soudainement, piégeant dans la glace
la faune vulnérable de l’Arctique, comme les oiseaux et les baleines, tels que
ceux montrés dans notre film. L’eau douce provenant de la Baie d’Hudson affecte
également sur les mécanismes à plus grande échelle, comme les courants marins
et le climat dans l’Atlantique Nord. Il s’agit donc d’un problème grave à
l’échelle mondiale. 


En
quoi votre contribution pourra aider :
Mise en
œuvre de solutions viables :
Votre soutien sera utile à notre campagne pour la mise en œuvre de solutions
viables. Pendant des années nous nous sommes préparés, à travers la création de

""On en ressort avec un seul conseil: courez le voir au grand écran"" 4/5 Etoiles La Presse""Le film est militant et engagé. Il pousse son 
commentaire éditorial. Mais on en retient bien davantage un appel des 
sens qui se transpose de l’écran au spectateur avec une acuité rarement 
vue.
                            Il y a les images. 
Magiques, lumineuses, parfois troublantes. Ces envolées majestueuses des
 eiders dans des cadrages très serrés. Leurs plongées olympiques sous 
l’eau pour débusquer oursins et moules. Il y a les sons. Purs, crus, 
cristallins. Des pas sur la neige qui craque. Les cris des animaux 
déchirant les grandes étendues neigeuses. Il y a le goût, sauvage, de la
 viande de phoque et d’eider sous la langue.
Ce film est un 
poème. Littéralement. Et comme il traite avec originalité d’un sujet 
très rarement vu au grand écran, on peut difficilement demander mieux. 
Long métrage documentaire, AU GRÉ DE LA PLUME ARCTIQUE nous amène dans 
les îles Belcher, où des Innus vivent de chasse et de pêche depuis des 
temps ancestraux. Le bout du monde, version feuille d’érable. Mais 
voilà. Depuis quelques décennies, la construction de grands barrages 
hydroélectriques et le rejet d’eau des réservoirs dans la baie d’Hudson 
adoucissent ses eaux en plus de ralentir les courants. Avec pour 
conséquences que les polynies, petites étendues d’eau qui ne gèlent pas 
sur la banquise et où se rassemblent les eiders pour survivre, ont 
tendance à se refermer, ce qui les force à migrer. Les Innus en perdent 
leur latin. Ils disent qu’on a renversé les saisons. «La glace est plus 
difficile à comprendre», dit l’un d’eux.
Cela dit, il ne 
faut pas s’arrêter seulement à l’aspect écologiste du film. AU GRÉ DE LA
 PLUME ARCTIQUE nous frappe bien davantage par son équilibre entre homme
 et nature, entre traditions anciennes et modernisme, entre silences et 
paroles. Le tout, d’une saison à l’autre, du jour à la nuit, sous des 
paysages grandioses.""
-André Duchesne, La Presse


Nous avons embauché un publicitaire, réservé un
espace, et maintenant nous avons besoin de votre aide pour faire salle comble,
pour prendre part aux forums de discussion et pour nous aider à amener les
membres de la communauté Inuit à faire partie intégrante de tout cela à New
York, car c’est là que nous se trouve notre meilleure chance de trouver des
solutions !
À noter : le financement de
cette campagne ne sert pas au lancement de notre film « People of a
Feather », lequel a déjà été pris en charge par notre distributeur First
Run Features. L’objectif de cette campagne est de passer du partage du
savoir à l’action avec la Waterkeeper Alliance, afin de soulever ces
questions à New York et d’implanter des politiques de libre accès aux cours
d’eau, ainsi que des stratégies élémentaires de gestion de l’eau pour les
réservoirs hydroélectriques.
« People of a Feather » a
été produit et distribué sans but lucratif grâce à la Société des Eiders de
l’Arctique (AES-SEA). Nous sommes un organisme de bienfaisance enregistré au
Canada. Voir les détails ci-dessous à propos de reçus officiels pour le Canada
et les États-Unis.


Du savoir à l’action
Prenez part à
l’implantation de solutions viables pour la banquise
Nous travaillons
de paire avec la Waterkeeper Alliance et d’autres groupes d’experts et de
décideurs pour l’obtention de deux solutions simples et réalisables :  
1. Un
accès libre. L’industrie hydroélectrique dans le Nord du Canada demeure
très discrète sur leurs techniques actuelles de gestion de l’eau et sur le
débit des rivières. Ces informations sont nécessaires aux communautés, aux
gouvernements et à toutes les autres parties concernées pour comprendre les
effets néfastes sur les écosystèmes de la banquise, afin d’établir des règles
et des limites pouvant atténuer ces impacts. Comme c’est le cas pour les
sociétés publiques, ces informations devraient obligatoirement être accessibles
pour tous. Nous avons besoin de votre aide pour que cela change MAINTENANT. Même si c’était tout ce que nous pouvions
accomplir pour l’instant, cela représenterait un pas de géant dans la bonne
direction.  
2. Implantation
de stratégies élémentaires de gestion de l’eau. En ce moment, l’industrie
hydrolectrique contrôle le débit des rivières en fonction de la demande en
électricité sans contrôle ni considération quant aux impacts sur
l’environnement. Nous avons besoin que des stratégies élémentaires de gestion
de l’eau soient adoptées pour tous les projets hydroélectriques dans le Nord du
Canada, afin de minimiser les effets néfastes qu’entraînent les hausses de la
demande en électricité (surtout en période de pointe) sur le cours des rivières.
Des technologies et des infrastructures déjà existantes pourraient être
utilisées pour le stockage et la distribution d’énergie, ce qui permettrait de
fournir l’énergie supplémentaire nécessaire en période de pointe, sans que de
grandes quantités d’eau douce ne soient libérées dans les écosystèmes fragiles
de la banquise en hiver. Des stratégies de gestion de l’eau sont exigées par la
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
pour chaque barrage aux États-Unis, et devraient l’être également pour les
importations d’électricité en provenance du Canada. Cela aurait dû être fait il
y a plus de 20 ans et nous avons besoin de votre aide pour que ça change
MAINTENANT.

QUI POUVEZ-VOUS
AIDER À SE RENDRE À NEW YORK ?
Daniel Qavvik est le jeune premier en vedette dans notre film People
of a Feather. Il a également participé à certains de nos évènements
caritatifs, conscientisant le public et dirigeant les entrevues avec les
médias. Son implication dans le projet lui a inspiré de devenir le premier
agent de protection de la faune Inuit, dans son village natal de Sanikiluaq. Il
a également complété les dernières étapes de son programme au Nunavut Arctic
College, remportant le titre d’« étudiant de l’année » pour 2013.
Lucassie
Arragutainaq travaille
pour la municipalité de Sanikiluaq en gestion de la faune et pour des
programmes environnementaux. Il a dirigé plusieurs initiatives de collaboration
dans la Baie d’Hudson pendant plus de 20 ans, incluant Voices from the Bay, un recueil compilant les connaissances de 28
communautés Inuit et Cries à propos de ces impacts. Il a su favoriser la tenue
de programmes de surveillance locaux et possède une vaste expérience de la
faune, de la recherche et des effets néfastes du développement hydroélectrique
sur les écosystèmes de la banquise.
Dinah Kavik (B.Éd., M.Éd) a participé à la rédaction et à la
coordination de notre film, en plus d’y associer les programmes culturels de
l’école, d’interviewer les ainés et d’en faire la traduction. C’est une
communicatrice exceptionnelle et elle est une source intarissable de
connaissances Inuit sur le sujet, en raison de son travail avec le comité
environnemental et Voices from the Bay.  
Johnny
Kudluarok a depuis
plus d’une décennie travaillé en étroite collaboration avec l’équipe, par son implication
en tant que guide et animateur des programmes communautaires de recherche et de
surveillance. Il a été le principal assistant à la production et co-développeur
de People of a Feather, est membre de
notre conseil d’administration et a pris part à des activités de
sensibilisation à Toronto, Ottawa, Montréal et Vancouver. 
Notre
organisme n’a les fonds nécessaire que pour inviter une seule de ces
personnes ; nos chercheurs et administrateurs assument eux-mêmes
leurs frais de voyage. Nous avons donc besoin de votre aide pour donner la
chance à ces individus de la Baie d’Hudson de s’y rendre et d’impliquer
également les Inuits du Labrador, où de nouveaux barrages hydroélectriques sont
construits et pourraient avoir les mêmes effets dévastateurs sur l’écosystème
de la banquise dont ils dépendent. Ces questions vont plus loin que les limites
de la juridiction, et New York est le plus grand importateur d’électricité ;
c’est donc là et maintenant que nous serons en mesure de s’unir et de faire
changer les choses !   
  

Historique et contexte actuel
Les
projets hydroélectriques ont battu de nouveaux records lors de l’hiver très
froid de 2013, alors que des quantités jamais égalées d’eaux provenant des
réservoirs ont été rejetées dans les habitats de la banquise, déjà dans un état
critique, dans le processus de génération d’électricité pour répondre à la
demande accrue en provenance de la côte est. On s’attend cette année encore à
un hiver très froid. Les Inuits travaillent depuis 30 ans à contrer les effets
néfastes de la demande accrue en électricité en hiver sur la vie marine, qui
aujourd’hui renversent littéralement le débit normal des rivières en cette
saison dans la mer intérieure de la Baie d’Hudson. Avec l’aide de personnalités
à New York comme Robert Kennedy Jr., les communautés Inuits et Cries ont été en
mesure de stopper le développement du projet hydroélectrique de Grande-Baleine
au début des années 90. Toutefois, cela n’a que relayé le problème à plus tard,
car de nouveaux projets de détournements et de barrages ont été complétés dans
le Nord du Québec en 2010. De nouveaux développements sont actuellement en
cours au Labrador.
Malgré 30
ans d’efforts pour mettre de l’avant ces questions graves, les préoccupations
des Inuits à propos des effets cumulatifs sur les écosystèmes restent sans
réponses. Des barrages ont déjà été construits au Québec, en Ontario et au
Manitoba, mais les stratégies de gestion de l’eau et les nouvelles politiques
de stockage et de distribution d’énergie pourraient être la solution à ce problème,
particulièrement durant l’hiver, pendant les périodes de pointe où la demande
en électricité est accrue. Les Inuits du Labrador sont présentement impliqués
dans un conflit juridique à propos du projet de barrage de Muskrat Falls, dans
le Bas-Churchill. Les exportations vers New York sont le facteur  économique clé de ces méga-projets
hydroélectriques ; les New Yorkais ont donc leur mot à dire quant à la
manière dont ces barrages sont construits et exploités. Il est temps de secouer
la population de la grosse pomme et de résoudre enfin le problème ! Si les New Yorkais exigent un libre accès
aux données hydrologiques et des statégies élémentaires de gestion de l’eau
comme une condition à l’importation d’électricité provenant du Canada, ce
problème serait définitivement réglé. Mettons tout en oeuvre pour y arriver
!

hard work, the <a href=""http://wawild.org/our-work/wild-campaigns/alpine-lakes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alpine Lakes Wilderness Additions and Pratt and Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie Rivers Protection Act</a> passed Congress!  This legislation will protect <b>over 22,000
acres of Wilderness and almost 40 miles Wild and Scenic Rivers</b>.  As a result clean water, native trout,
world-class outdoor recreation opportunities, and downstream beer will all be
protected now and for future generations. </p>
<p>For the past two years,
Washington Wild has sought innovative ways to broaden its outreach efforts to build
the conservation community.  Through our
<a href=""www.wawild.org/brewsheds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Washington Brewshed ® Alliance</a>, we work with local craft brewers to educate the
public about the importance of protecting upper watersheds which serve as the
source of clean water for wildlife, fish, businesses, residents and also great
tasting beer.  </p>
<h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p>To celebrate this
important milestone and achievement years in the making, one of our Brewshed®
Partners – <a href=""http://www.elliottbaybrewing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elliot Bay Brewing Company</a> – has offered the beer and conservation
communities a celebratory challenge: to raise $2,500 (we have made our Indiegogo goal $1,500 since we have additional internal methods to take donations) to support Washington
Wild’s Brewshed® Alliance and our conservation work as a whole.  When we meet this goal they will release a
celebratory limited edition batch of beer, the Alpine Lakes Pale!</p>
<p>Donations totaling
$2,500 or more will not only ensure the release of this batch but also support Washington
Wild’s conservation work for the passage of Wilderness initiatives like Alpine
Lakes. But there’s much more to it! 
Elliot Bay Brewing Company has offered to generously donate $1 per pint sold
of the ENTIRE BATCH of Alpine Lakes Pale, which will be on tap at all three
Elliot Bay Brewing Company locations (West Seattle, Lake City, and Burien).  In addition, <a href=""http://www.countrymaltgroup.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Country Malt Group</a> and <a href=""http://hopsdirect.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hops Direct, LLC</a> have both generously donated their product as an in kind donation
that Elliot Bay Brewing Company will pass onto Washington Wild.  And if that isn’t enough, Elliot Bay Brewing
Company will host a release party on February 19, 2015 in the aptly named
Cascade Room at their <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps?q=12537+Lake+City+Way+NE+Seattle,+WA+98125&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=47.727431,-122.292595&amp;spn=0.045033,0.111494&amp;sll=47.614727,-122.325211&amp;sspn=0.180522,0.445976&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=12537+Lake+City+Way+NE,+Seattle,+Washington+98125&amp;t=m&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lake City Way location</a> to celebrate both achievements!</p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>The Brewshed® Alliance
was initiated in 2012 and since then has reached over 2,500 people with the impactful
message of the Brewshed® connection: protected water makes superior beer.  Our 28 brewery and beer community partners
have joined us to help spread the word, but now they are challenging <b><i>you</i></b>
saying, “It’s your turn to show that you received the message.” </p>
<p>We’ve seen
unprecedented support of the Washington Brewshed® Alliance from the
professional beer community.  And now we
are celebrating the designation of the addition to the Alpine Lakes Wilderness,
which directly protect the water source for Brewshed® partner Icicle Brewing
Company.  This bill represents the quintessential
Brewshed® connection, but it also represents a great opportunity: to celebrate

<li>Green Desert Sanctuary is a place and a mind-space about rejuvenation for the spirit that works in harmony with our planet. We seek to better understand the natural ways of life so that we can honor them in all our activities. And we are also a working farm, growing and sharing nutritious organic food so that everyone and anyone can access abundance in health while helping to heal our planet and home. We teach others how they can act as more responsible stewards of the precious gift of life in all its forms, and we encourage recognition that we are ALL ONE, united in a common destiny and a present  time of turbulence. We focus on utilizing appropriate technology and knowledge to forward these goals, while looking for ""forgotten ways"" that hold the secrets to a better, more restorative future for us all.</li>
<li>Industrial Hemp fits perfectly with this vision: It is has been reported as Carbon Negative, requires little if any pesticides or herbicides, needs only moderately fertile soil, and in fact improves the soil as it is growing. Fiber varieties produce massive amounts of a renewable/sustainable fiber that can be used for everything from bio-plastics to fiber based products like paper and textiles. Seed Varieties produce up to a ton of oil-rich seed per acre, and hemp seed is one of the most nutritious protein and vitamin/mineral rich superfoods on the planet. And all this benefit comes from a plant that is very eco-friendly to grow, harvest and process, and there is no waste product. Every portion of either seed or fiber varieties is usable. Even if the plant matter is just shredded into mulch, it makes a fabulous mulch that attracts over 100 times as many worms as other mulch products, and helps prevent spread of diseases when used for fruit orchards.</li>
<li>What we hope to do: We're going to install a large 2800 square foot unheated hoop house that will allow us to trial two varieties of hemp that should do well in Colorado. A seed variety from Finland will be the majority of the planting, and a fiber variety from northern Italy will complete the trials. We are planning to grow in the semi-protected space of the hoop house for 2 reasons: it will allow us to control several environmental variables, including wind, humidity, and temperature, and it will extend the growing season later into the fall to allow us the best chance for both varieties to reach full maturity. This initial trial will teach us volumes about the culture of both plants, and hopefully also greatly expand our amount of viable seed so that next year we will be able to do larger outdoor field trials. We are also looking to register with the state as a hemp processor for the fall, so that we can do more, legally, with the end product.</li>
<li>What success this year will mean to the future of industrial hemp cannot be overstated. It has been more than 50 years in this country since farmers have been able to grow hemp. During that time, and with the help of DEA policies, much has been lost, both in terms of knowledge and experience, as well as genetic material. Kentucky hemp was once world famous as an exemplary fiber strain, and is now suspected to be extinct. We need to start to rebuild this industry and this gene base for industrial hemp to have a chance in the US. It's potential for impacting everything about our lives is huge- from our food to everyday consumer products to the health of the soils and our planet. WE NEED TO ACTUALIZE THAT POTENTIAL! And this project is one step in that direction.</li>

<li>We've already sourced both types of seed, the Finnish oil-seed strain and the Italian fiber strain, we just need to get that seed delivered. It's about 2 kilograms of seed from a couple different international sources, and costs about $200 to get it here.</li>
<li>We'll need that large hoop-house/poly-tunnel mentioned above. That's pretty easy, as it is commonplace technology and readily available, we just need to get it ordered and installed: $8000</li>
<li>We need to install a well and solar pump to keep everything adequately watered. Well depth in the area is less than 100 feet, and possibly much less (lots of local artesian springs) and our design is simple and relies mostly on gravity for water distribution once the water is pumped up and stored at the surface in a 1600 gallon cistern: $6700</li>
<li>And we'll need a couple specialized tools- a precision seed planter, and several pairs of harvesting shears, as we'll be doing this all by hand: $300</li>
</ul><p>**The state may or may not decide to come and inspect our crop and test it for psychoactive compounds, which won't be an issue as the varieties we've selected are all listed for use in the EU, which means they already contain less than the 0.3%THC levels the sate of Colorado is looking for. However, if they do decide to come visit, we'll be responsible for covering that cost. Which means any extra money raised will be set aside for that possibility.***** </p><ul>
<li><u>In Exchange for your support, we've got lots of exciting perks for you:</u></li>
<li>If you're in Colorado, you can actually get some viable hemp seed, provided all goes well, for your own garden hemp project. (the law prevents this distribution of seed across state borders, sorry)</li>
<li>No matter where you are, we'll be able to send you some processed hemp goodies, including that excellent mulch.</li>
<li>We've also got a lot of exciting hemp themed thank you gifts, from the handy bumper sticker and t-shirts to tote bags, all available because someone in a faraway land grew some hemp, but you're helping to change that.</li>
<li>No matter what happens with this fund-raiser, we're committed to the project. This is Plan B or C already (we've been thinking about this for a while after all) but we've also worked out up to plan G or H.

This is our motto. 
Der Energieverbrauch steigt jährlich um 2-3% trotz LED-Lampen oder anderen Energiesparprodukten. Energy consumption increases annually by 2-3%, despite of LED lamps or other products designed to save energy. Seit nun einigen Jahren beschäftigen wir uns mit der Errichtung und Wartung von PV-Anlagen und als Fan von ""Crowdfunding"" dachte ich: ""Warum nicht eine Kampagne für eine unserer Sonnenkraftwerke erstellen?""For several years now we devote ourselves to the construction and maintenance of PV-Facilities and being a fan of ""Crowdfunding"" I thought: ""Why don't we create a campaign for one of our solar power plants?"" Wer sind wir? Wir, die ECO Capital MEPE, mit Sitz in Thessaloniki, sind eine Tochter der österreichischen PV-Betreibergesellschaft. Ich, Peter Aldrian, bin Geschäftsführer und leite die Projekte. Wir betreiben bereits einige Anlagen in Österreich und Griechenland und als jemand, der die Idee des ""Crowdfunding"" näher kennenlernen durfte, dachte ich, dies wäre eine tolle Kampagne für die CF Community.Who are we?We, the ECO Capital MEPE, situated in Thessaloniki, are an affiliated company of the Austrian PV- operating company. My name is Peter Aldrian and I am CEO and leader of all projects. We already operate several facilities in Austria and Greece and as a person who learned to know the idea of ""Crowdfunding"" I thought of the fact that this would be a great campaign for the CF Community.  Unsere Homepage / Our HomepageZum Projekt: Wir haben schon einen Großteil der Anlage vorfinanziert aber uns fehlt immer noch das Kapital für einen endgültigen Anschluss ans Netz.The Project:We have already pre-financed most of the facility but we still lack the funds for a final connection to the grid.

<p>What if instead of your mutual fund buying stock in Exxon-Mobil, it could earn a return financing a project to clean up a local water supply?</p>
<p>What if there was a way to get private investors – everyone from you and me to Apple and the Gates Foundation – interested in financing crucial programs, even if they don't generate any revenue?</p>
<p>Meet the <strong>Social Impact Bond</strong>, an innovative mechanism that gives investors the incentive to finance conservation and social programs by creating a return on the money used to pay for them.</p>
<p>Britain, Massachusetts, and New York City are currently moving forward their own Social Impact Bonds, but they’re all for social programs: homelessness and prison recidivism.</p>
<p>My project is to implement the first-ever Social Impact Bond for a conservation program.</p>
<p>The California Dept. of Parks &amp; Recreation had its budget slashed and, as a result, threatened to close 70 state parks. I want to use Social Impact Bonds to encourage investors to supplement the financing of California's State Parks.</p>
<p>How does a Social Impact Bond work? The trick is to find a program that, if enacted now, saves money in the future. And it's much cheaper to keep up with park maintenance now – like conducting controlled burns and preventing the dumping of waste – than it is to extinguish an out-of-control wildfire or clean up a polluted stream.</p>
<h3><strong>What I Need...</strong></h3>
<p>To make this happen, the first step is to determine the economic value of the ecosystem services (like water quality maintenance and fire suppression) coming from the parks. To have authority, this study needs to be done by experts who have told me that it will take approximately 100 hours and cost about $10,000. This is the purpose of this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>The annual budget for this entire project is $96,000. I expect the bulk of this funding to come from grants, but grants take months and months to process and California's State Parks don’t have a lot of time.</p>
<p>Any money raised beyond the $10K goal will allow me to get started right away on the other aspects of the campaign -- like building a coalition of support and moving forward legislation in Sacramento. And just as importantly, it will help me make a much stronger case when applying for grant money, as the project will seem much more viable once it has achieved some successes.</p>
<h3><strong>About Me...</strong></h3>
<p>What makes me qualified to do this work? I recently earned an MBA from Presidio Graduate School in San Francisco and before that worked in Washington, DC where I spearheaded a campaign that achieved passage of a federal law. In this work, I built a diverse coalition of national nonprofits, industry associations, and private firms to advocate for a law to prevent the import and sale of illegally-sourced wood products in the U.S. The law's passage received international attention from the forest products industry and, according to the UK’s <a href=""http://www.illegal-logging.info/uploads/CHillegalloggingpaperwebready1.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chatham House</a>, has led to a substantial reduction in illegal logging in forest-rich developing nations around the world.</p>
<p>This project would be very similar to that work, where I have a track record of success.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact...</strong></h3>
<p>Social Impact Bonds are a way to permanently supplement the Park Department's budget and address the problems created by California's budget crisis.</p>

This opportunity means so much to me, and again, all contributions are incredibly appreciated. https://www.ciee.org/go-abroad/high-school-stud...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>Dear Friends &amp; Supporters of Dreams,  </p>
<p>I'm asking you to support this project to show that people really do care about sustainable consumerism, parks, and living in a world of beauty and to help me raise at least half if not all of the $30K needed to create the first Environmentally and Community Conscious (TM) Umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>What is so right now is a couple of things</strong></p>
<p>A) millions of disposable umbrellas end up in American landfills each year (most of them are likely because of people who live in NYC)</p>
<p>B)  public city parks across the country and around the world are at threat because of increasing budget cuts and governments who lack foresight.  My big dream is to build public city parks with playgrounds for adults and teenagers, because everybody should enjoy such play.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>C) millions of people aren’t enjoingy rainy day because they’re carrying depressingly black umbrellas that give no pleasure.  Life's short, why have any gloomy days?  There's no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.  </p>
<p><strong>In order to solve these three problems, through my company Amé Amé, which today is a raingear &amp; candy specialty boutique I plan to  create the first Environmentally &amp; Community Conscious  (TM) umbrella.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding how the money will be spent - Every dollar of the $30K earned will be used specifically for the cost of producing the umbrellas.  (Umbrella manufacturers require large minimum orders for a single design and artwork.) </p>
<p>Some of the perks I am offering, are part of the 110% Heart collection I designed for Amé Amé to inspire people to live their lives with 110% Heart and to really dream, believe, and take action.    </p>
<p>For me the dream is to make beautiful, high quality umbrellas and to build amazing parks.    What's your dream?</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting this project!</p>
<p>Teresa</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>If you're still not convinced you want to support this project or you want to hear more of the story , then please read on...but first a look at some perks</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Our sweetest perk is $30 of Candy Store Credit, that you can use to fill special candy jars and containers we sell at the store for easy gift buying.  Or just enjoy the candy yourself.  A lot of people don't realize it, but we're a  full on candy store with 100 different premium varieties at any given time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""$30 of Pick 'n Mix Candy for $25!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://amerain.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/3-candy-jars.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""$30 of Pick 'n Mix Candy for $25!""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or for $200 get yourself $200 worth of gift certificates plus our M11 bag that's perfect for carrying 2 bottles of wine (or the Mac Air 11 inch laptop).  </p>
<p>If you know you will be investing into a Barbour jacket, or some good rain boots, and doing some of holiday shopping for nice gifts this year, then go for the $500 perk, for which you get $600 of gift certificates!  We have all sorts of things.  Ame Ame specializes in umbrellas, other rain wear, and candy but we have lots of other terrific gift items.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The M11 Bag Will Soon Be Coming in our ""Sail Through Life Following Your Dreams""  design but instead of a black bag, it will be natural canvas.  </p>
<p>It's for the men and the women who don't like hearts.   It will make for a fun tote to carry wine to your summer BBQ's and parties. Plus you'll be more environmental because you'll be able to stop taking bags at the wine and liquor store.  </p>

""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>How can you not find it sad to see so many umbrellas in the garbage?</p>
<p>Each year millions of umbrellas made of steel or aluminum and petroleum based products go to the landfill (most of which are handmade with sweat shop labor).</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>These umbrellas are bought and used for only a few times before they break because people chose to buy cheap umbrellas for the sake of convenience or because they were fooled into believing they were getting an umbrella of quality or because they simply didn’t know quality umbrellas actually exist.    </p>
<p>And when people carry umbrellas with no style or self-expression and umbrellas that flip inside out with any little breath of wind it makes me sad because I know based on customer feedback they are missing out on an opportunity to enjoy the rain.   </p>
<p>Thus for years I’ve been on a mission to make beautiful umbrellas that reduce our environmental impact and make people love the rain as well as their umbrellas. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><img alt=""Teresa Soroka with an eco friendly Umbrella Made of Cotton &amp; Bamboo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://amerain.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/teresa-soroka-indiegogo.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""It's been my dream for more than 10 years to design my own umbrellas &amp; do good for the world.""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But umbrellas are expensive to make and they have very large minimum order quantities.  Hence up until now I’ve not been able to produce my own umbrellas. </p>
<p>Now, though, after 10 years of studying what makes a good umbrella and being just 3 months away from the deadline to manufacture umbrellas for next Fall, I’m determined to sell 2000  110% Heart bags  to raise the $30K I need to create my very first order of umbrellas as the first step to having a full line of Amé Amé” umbrellas.</p>
<p>Amé Amé is the name of the East Village New York City store I've had for 14 months.  It translates literally to “rain candy” in Japanese and I think that  on a rainy if you're not at the park dancing in the rain, being at the movies with a good bag of a candy is one of the best alternatives. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""The Flag at Ame Ame's boutique"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://amerain.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/AmeAme-Store-Flag.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Visit our Rain Gear &amp; Candy Boutique in NYC""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s been such a pleasure having customers love the new experience of a quality, beautiful umbrella as well as Amé Amé's mission to be Environmentally and Community Conscious™.</p>
<p>But without the ability to sell my own umbrellas I’m not walking as much of the walk I could be walking to make the world a better place, and instead talking a lot to sell the umbrellas of other brands.</p>
<p>Furthermore I want to create umbrellas in collaboration with artists so that I can help spread greater appreciation of art and the artists creating such beauty.  I appreciate the work of Monet and Van Gough, but I think it would be better if an umbrella had the art work of somebody alive today. </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>So I hope that you can find a way to support this project. </p>
<p>Think about the different people who would appreciate a 110% Heart Tote bag this year for a birthday or holiday gift. </p>
<p>Think about the people in your lives who actually need to be reminded that if they just live their life with 110% Heart the most important part of their dreams will come true.</p>
<p>It took 110% Heart for me to open a raingear and candy business.  Can you believe how many people first thought the idea of selling umbrellas let alone the combo of raingear and candy was crazy?</p>
<p>Well guess what, Amé Amé and I make lots of people happy when they come to shop or browse, and even happier when they realize how wonderful a good umbrella is. </p>
<p>I hope the challenge I’ve taken on can inspire others, and that’s the final benefit of supporting this campaign. </p>
<p>When I finally have my self-designed products being carried around (like the 110% Heart merchandise and our future ECC umbrella), I hope to finally inspire others with Amé Amé’s motto</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Ame Ame's Moto.  There's no such thing as bad weather.  Dream - Believe - Take Action.

<p>Just what is a life of 110% Heart? </p>
<p><strong>Living a life of 110% Heart means that you are passionate, determined to make a difference in the world, and appreciative of all that you have.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for supporting this project with any contribution you can afford for the sake of ensuring there are parks and natural resources for tomorrow’s generation.   </p>
<p>Thank you for supporting this project if you like the notion of living life with 110% Heart.</p>
<p>And since you’ve read this far, thank you for helping to spread word of it through facebook postings, tweets, and email blasts and continuing to stay tune as to what we do between March 3<sup>rd</sup> and the summer Solstice to make a difference in the world in 110 Days with 110% Heart.</p>

<p><strong><span> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span> </span></strong></p>
<p><span>These bags you're buying are high quality and made in New Hampshire..</span></p>
<p>I custom designed their shape to be ergonomic and sensible.  </p>
<p><span>Carrying them you'll stand taller and avoid aches and pains that other bags often cause.  </span></p>
<p>Each bag, both the M11 and M18 have zipper close tops and inside big pockets that can fit wallet, keys, phone, AND a mini emergency umbrella.  The pocket also has zip closure so that things stay more secure.</p>
<p><span>The M11 was designed for the Mac Air 11"" but people are loving how it perfectly fits two bottles of wine</span></p>
<p>Their retail price is $45.  For the indiegogo they go for $55 to include cost of shipping and indiegogo fees.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I chose to make a ""NYC, the City of 110% Heart""  bag because I see NYC as a city that symbolizes living life with 110% Heart.  I don't think there's any city with more transplant people determined to make their dreams come true.  And I admire NYC and New Yorkers for that fact.  </p>
<p> If you don't live in NYC I bet you know somebody who dreams of moving to NYC to make dreams come true.  So please consider giving them this bag.</p>

Our sweetest perk is $30 of Candy Store Credit, that you can use to fill special candy jars and containers we sell at the store for easy gift buying.  Or just enjoy the candy yourself.  A lot of people don't realize it, but we're a  full on candy store with 100 different premium varieties at any given time.
 

 
 
Or for $200 get yourself $200 worth of gift certificates plus our M11 bag that's perfect for carrying 2 bottles of wine (or the Mac Air 11 inch laptop).  
If you know you will be investing into a Barbour jacket, or some good rain boots, and doing some of holiday shopping for nice gifts this year, then go for the $500 perk, for which you get $600 of gift certificates!  We have all sorts of things.  Ame Ame specializes in umbrellas, other rain wear, and candy but we have lots of other terrific gift items.

 
 

 
The M11 Bag Will Soon Be Coming in our ""Sail Through Life Following Your Dreams""  design but instead of a black bag, it will be natural canvas.  
It's for the men and the women who don't like hearts.   It will make for a fun tote to carry wine to your summer BBQ's and parties. Plus you'll be more environmental because you'll be able to stop taking bags at the wine and liquor store.  

 
 
Now for more of the story and my passion....

 
 
 
 

 
How can you not find it sad to see so many umbrellas in the garbage?
Each year millions of umbrellas made of steel or aluminum and petroleum based products go to the landfill (most of which are handmade with sweat shop labor).
  
These umbrellas are bought and used for only a few times before they break because people chose to buy cheap umbrellas for the sake of convenience or because they were fooled into believing they were getting an umbrella of quality or because they simply didn’t know quality umbrellas actually exist.    
And when people carry umbrellas with no style or self-expression and umbrellas that flip inside out with any little breath of wind it makes me sad because I know based on customer feedback they are missing out on an opportunity to enjoy the rain.   
Thus for years I’ve been on a mission to make beautiful umbrellas that reduce our environmental impact and make people love the rain as well as their umbrellas. 
 
  

 
But umbrellas are expensive to make and they have very large minimum order quantities.  Hence up until now I’ve not been able to produce my own umbrellas. 
Now, though, after 10 years of studying what makes a good umbrella and being just 3 months away from the deadline to manufacture umbrellas for next Fall, I’m determined to sell 2000  110% Heart bags  to raise the $30K I need to create my very first order of umbrellas as the first step to having a full line of Amé Amé” umbrellas.
Amé Amé is the name of the East Village New York City store I've had for 14 months.  It translates literally to “rain candy” in Japanese and I think that  on a rainy if you're not at the park dancing in the rain, being at the movies with a good bag of a candy is one of the best alternatives. 
 

 
It’s been such a pleasure having customers love the new experience of a quality, beautiful umbrella as well as Amé Amé's mission to be Environmentally and Community Conscious™.
But without the ability to sell my own umbrellas I’m not walking as much of the walk I could be walking to make the world a better place, and instead talking a lot to sell the umbrellas of other brands.
Furthermore I want to create umbrellas in collaboration with artists so that I can help spread greater appreciation of art and the artists creating such beauty.  I appreciate the work of Monet and Van Gough, but I think it would be better if an umbrella had the art work of somebody alive today. 
 

 
So I hope that you can find a way to support this project. 
Think about the different people who would appreciate a 110% Heart Tote bag this year for a birthday or holiday gift. 
Think about the people in your lives who actually need to be reminded that if they just live their life with 110% Heart the most important part of their dreams will come true.
It took 110% Heart for me to open a raingear and candy business.  Can you believe how many people first thought the idea of selling umbrellas let alone the combo of raingear and candy was crazy?
Well guess what, Amé Amé and I make lots of people happy when they come to shop or browse, and even happier when they realize how wonderful a good umbrella is. 
I hope the challenge I’ve taken on can inspire others, and that’s the final benefit of supporting this campaign. 
When I finally have my self-designed products being carried around (like the 110% Heart merchandise and our future ECC umbrella), I hope to finally inspire others with Amé Amé’s motto
 

Just what is a life of 110% Heart? 
Living a life of 110% Heart means that you are passionate, determined to make a difference in the world, and appreciative of all that you have.
Thank you for supporting this project with any contribution you can afford for the sake of ensuring there are parks and natural resources for tomorrow’s generation.   
Thank you for supporting this project if you like the notion of living life with 110% Heart.
And since you’ve read this far, thank you for helping to spread word of it through facebook postings, tweets, and email blasts and continuing to stay tune as to what we do between March 3rd and the summer Solstice to make a difference in the world in 110 Days with 110% Heart.
Rain or Shine, Always Smiles,

About the bags desinged and other perks

 
 
These bags you're buying are high quality and made in New Hampshire..
I custom designed their shape to be ergonomic and sensible.  
Carrying them you'll stand taller and avoid aches and pains that other bags often cause.  
Each bag, both the M11 and M18 have zipper close tops and inside big pockets that can fit wallet, keys, phone, AND a mini emergency umbrella.  The pocket also has zip closure so that things stay more secure.
The M11 was designed for the Mac Air 11"" but people are loving how it perfectly fits two bottles of wine
Their retail price is $45.  For the indiegogo they go for $55 to include cost of shipping and indiegogo fees.  
  
Screen Print A - for the M18 Bag

 
 
I chose to make a ""NYC, the City of 110% Heart""  bag because I see NYC as a city that symbolizes living life with 110% Heart.  I don't think there's any city with more transplant people determined to make their dreams come true.  And I admire NYC and New Yorkers for that fact.  
 If you don't live in NYC I bet you know somebody who dreams of moving to NYC to make dreams come true.  So please consider giving them this bag.

</h3>
<p>When we first started working on the island of Pemba, off the Tanzanian coast, things were different. The entire eastern half of the island was deforested and most of the island's food was imported. Now Pemba is a model of sustainability. Since 2008, one million trees have been planted for fruit, timber and conservation. The soils have been mended and over 100 acres of food producing crops have been sown between rows of planted trees. Drinking water is harvested from the rain and electricity is generated from the sun. Pembans have innovated the way they grow food and how they cook the food they grow. <br/></p>
<p>Pembans have changed their island. <br/></p>
<p>Now it's time we work together to change the world. By sharing Pemba's work with the world we can inspire the scale of environmental change that our planet needs. Through indiegogo, we're trying to raise $8,000 in order to build a Rural Innovation Campus that will allow us to share our work with community leaders from around the world. Based on our past success in Pemba, the European Union wants to continue to support community-led innovation and is prepared to match every dollar we raise with $9. If we raise $8,000, we end up with $80,000. <br/></p>
<h3>The Opportunity<br/>
</h3>
<p>We need your 
help. We've been given the opportunity to build a campus that will allow us to expand our work, but 10% of the funds must be raised through donations. If we don't 
raise our end of the bargain, we don't get the funds.</p>
<p>Please share our vision. We're flipping the traditional development model upside down by placing rural communities in a role of leadership and expertise. We believe that people around the world can work together to find innovative solutions to some of humanity's toughest challenges. We believe that people can work together to make our world a better place; they just need the chance.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>According to a recent survey, the Midwest drought, genetically modified organisms and the lean finely textured beef ""pink slime"" misnomer take the cake for top trends affecting consumers' food purchasing behavior in 2012.</p>
<p>The survey, commissioned by Hunter Public Relations and conducted by Direct Research, Inc., found that 81% of Americans felt coverage of food products were of equal or greater importance than other news stories this year, HPR says.</p>
<p>watch this excellent video to update the viewer on the GMO FREE Movement GENETIC ROULETTE <a href=""http://youtu.be/wnlTYFKBg18"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/wnlTYFKBg18</a></p>
<p>GMO FREE HAWAII is a statewide grassroots organiztion that is connecting and reawakening a global consciousness through social media of the corporate greed of transnational companies that are destroying the flora and fauna of cultures that existed for millenia:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id=""ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_tr_tr_tr_rptStory_ctl01_cslStory"">The health dangers of genetically engineered (GE) foods are masterfully presented in this summary of our media campaign<br/></span></li>
<li><span id=""ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_tr_tr_tr_rptStory_ctl02_cslStory"">Americans get sick more often than Europeans or people from any other industrialized nation, and scientific evidence suggests a significant factor may be the genetic engineering of our food supply</span></li>
<li><span id=""ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_tr_tr_tr_rptStory_ctl03_cslStory"">Despite claims by government regulators and the food industry that GE foods are safe, scientific studies continue to show the opposite; GE foods have been linked with allergies, reproductive problems and infertility, birth defects, bizarre mutations, cancer, and now an unidentified mystery organism causing an epidemic of livestock deaths, “Sudden Death Syndrome”</span></li>
<li><span id=""ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_tr_tr_tr_rptStory_ctl04_cslStory"">GE foods trigger immune attack because they appear to your body as foreign invaders rather than food; this immune response can lead to chronic inflammation, which in turn raises your risk for multiple additional health problems</span></li>
<li><span id=""ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_tr_tr_tr_rptStory_ctl05_cslStory"">The two main types of GE foods are herbicide-tolerant crops and pesticide-producing crops; both are imprecise processes that are riddled with unexpected consequences, such as hundreds to thousands of genetic mutations that have unknown effects on human health</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a member of a COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION have your community association sign on to the statements about a GMO FREE HAWAII ( <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/HawaiianKiko12"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/HawaiianKiko12</a> ) that you agree with.</p>
<p>If you are a LEGISLATOR or agricultural decision maker, introduce or support legislation for 5-10 year moratorium on open air releases of GMO crops until longterm, peer reviewed animal, human health, environmental and agricultural studies can be done to ensure Hawaii's protection.  We can help organize testimony from the outer islands.</p>
<p>If you are a FARMER, refuse to grow GMO crops.  Educate other farmers about the problems of GMO farming.  Test your papaya trees and chop down your unwanted GMO trees.  Let your extension agent and legislators know the reasons why you don't want GMO pollen and seed in your growing environment.  Liability for contamination of your crops, loss of markets, high costs of testing, or loss of seed variety lines and ability to save clean seed are among the reasons.  Contact GMO FREE HAWAII for strategies for your industry group to follow to prevent commercial release of a GMO version of your crop such as the coffee and taro industries have done.</p>
<p>If you are a CONSUMER, shop and eat GMO free.  Use the consumer choice guide to help you choose GMO free foods.  When you buy papayas in the market in Hawaii, dispose of the seeds so they can't grow into GMO trees.  Demand labeling of GMO products from your market, manufacturers and governments, so that you can make an informed decision.</p>
<p>If you are a PARENT, feed your family GMO free.  These foods have not received adequate safety testing either by the manufacturer or the government regulatory agencies.  Japan Minister of Health is waiting 10 years and watching U.S. childen to see what the true effects of GMO foods will be.  Schools that feed their children whole foods and have removed GMO foods from the lunch and snack menus have noticed positive change in student behavior.  Contact your child's school and ask for these positive changes.  Check websites to stay abreast of new research on the health issues surrounding GMO foods.</p>
<p>If you are a CITIZEN, speak out.  Write letters to the editor ..this is an easy and direct way that you as an individual can have a big impact on the public discourse that affects policy.  Contact your legislators and let them know that this technology has entered the food chain and the ecosystem without sufficient testing and without your permission.  Ask for a moratorium until it has been adequately tested.  Give volunteer hours or financial support to GMO FREE HAWAII.  Educate yourself and your neighbors about this topic, which is often left out of mainstream news media.</p>
<p>If you are a GARDENER, use GMO free seeds.  Ask your county officials if any GMO crops are being grown or tested in your area with crops (especially corn) that could contaminate your family's garden corn crop.  Test the papaya trees in your yard and chop down GMO contaminated trees.  Save GMO free seed by bagging a flower of a hermaphrodite tree that you have tested and found GMO free.  The seeds of that fruit will be GMO free trees, but may get GMO air contamination in their fruits.  Let your Cooperative Extension office, Master Gardener program, and County and State lawmakers know that you want to garden in a GMO Free Hawaii.</p>
<p>If you are a DOCTOR or healer, educate your patients about the health concerns related to GMO foods and living near GMO crops.  When diagnosing, consider effects of a change from GMO free to GMO ingredients in your patient's diet.  Demand that your local public health department track possible allergic and other responses to ingestion or aerosoliztion of these deadly genes.  These foods have never gone through the normal regulatory channels of animal testing, human testing and post market surveys.</p>

<h3>What We Need to Fight the Global Elite ...                               </h3>
<h3>Initial Funding ( $150,000 )  will be used to achieve certain levels of hardware and acccessories</h3>
<ul>
<li>2012 Toyota Tundra 4X4 crew cab to reach over 60,000 acres of GMO farmland located on former plantation sugar &amp; pineapple fields</li>
<li>Digital Cameras ( 2 CANON SLR EOS 7D bodies ) to document GMO activities w/various lenses wide angle, normal, zoom, telephoto</li>
<li>Digital Video Cameras ( 2 CANON XH-A1S Professional Camcorder )</li>
<li>Post Production Computers &amp; Software to edit multimedia formats for DVD replication and duplication to educate the masses thru social media strategies</li>
<li>Parallel Marketing Projects that will be funded:<br/> media kits consisting of DVD's and printed literature</li>
<li>Sponsoring events to educate the public of the GMO movement</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Last year, GMO labeling passed every single county for Hawaii State Association of Counties except OAHU.  Resolution 12-138 urges University of Hawaii to study the link between neonicotinoid pesticides, gemetically modified organisms and the disappearance of the bees.  Recent studies in France led to a ban of GMO company SYNGENTA's Cruiser pesticide after confirming they contributed to the collapse of the bee colonies.  We need bees to pollinate our food and Hawaii is a leading exporter of Queen Bees worldwide.  The bees are dying, they are disappearing and we need to know why. Resolution 12-138 still has not been assigned a hearing and it was introduced in June 5, 2012.</p>
<p>We will never give up fighting GMO's.  We deserve the right to know what we are eating and whether or not it has been genetically modified.  We deserve to have natural food.  Hawaii and the world must stand up to fight the corporate greed of the multinational food conglomerates...</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
According to a recent survey, the Midwest drought, genetically modified organisms and the lean finely textured beef ""pink slime"" misnomer take the cake for top trends affecting consumers' food purchasing behavior in 2012.
The survey, commissioned by Hunter Public Relations and conducted by Direct Research, Inc., found that 81% of Americans felt coverage of food products were of equal or greater importance than other news stories this year, HPR says.
watch this excellent video to update the viewer on the GMO FREE Movement GENETIC ROULETTE http://youtu.be/wnlTYFKBg18
GMO FREE HAWAII is a statewide grassroots organiztion that is connecting and reawakening a global consciousness through social media of the corporate greed of transnational companies that are destroying the flora and fauna of cultures that existed for millenia:

The health dangers of genetically engineered (GE) foods are masterfully presented in this summary of our media campaign
Americans get sick more often than Europeans or people from any other industrialized nation, and scientific evidence suggests a significant factor may be the genetic engineering of our food supply
Despite claims by government regulators and the food industry that GE foods are safe, scientific studies continue to show the opposite; GE foods have been linked with allergies, reproductive problems and infertility, birth defects, bizarre mutations, cancer, and now an unidentified mystery organism causing an epidemic of livestock deaths, “Sudden Death Syndrome”
GE foods trigger immune attack because they appear to your body as foreign invaders rather than food; this immune response can lead to chronic inflammation, which in turn raises your risk for multiple additional health problems
The two main types of GE foods are herbicide-tolerant crops and pesticide-producing crops; both are imprecise processes that are riddled with unexpected consequences, such as hundreds to thousands of genetic mutations that have unknown effects on human health

If you are a member of a COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION have your community association sign on to the statements about a GMO FREE HAWAII ( http://www.facebook.com/HawaiianKiko12 ) that you agree with.
If you are a LEGISLATOR or agricultural decision maker, introduce or support legislation for 5-10 year moratorium on open air releases of GMO crops until longterm, peer reviewed animal, human health, environmental and agricultural studies can be done to ensure Hawaii's protection.  We can help organize testimony from the outer islands.
If you are a FARMER, refuse to grow GMO crops.  Educate other farmers about the problems of GMO farming.  Test your papaya trees and chop down your unwanted GMO trees.  Let your extension agent and legislators know the reasons why you don't want GMO pollen and seed in your growing environment.  Liability for contamination of your crops, loss of markets, high costs of testing, or loss of seed variety lines and ability to save clean seed are among the reasons.  Contact GMO FREE HAWAII for strategies for your industry group to follow to prevent commercial release of a GMO version of your crop such as the coffee and taro industries have done.
If you are a CONSUMER, shop and eat GMO free.  Use the consumer choice guide to help you choose GMO free foods.  When you buy papayas in the market in Hawaii, dispose of the seeds so they can't grow into GMO trees.  Demand labeling of GMO products from your market, manufacturers and governments, so that you can make an informed decision.
If you are a PARENT, feed your family GMO free.  These foods have not received adequate safety testing either by the manufacturer or the government regulatory agencies.  Japan Minister of Health is waiting 10 years and watching U.S. childen to see what the true effects of GMO foods will be.  Schools that feed their children whole foods and have removed GMO foods from the lunch and snack menus have noticed positive change in student behavior.  Contact your child's school and ask for these positive changes.  Check websites to stay abreast of new research on the health issues surrounding GMO foods.
If you are a CITIZEN, speak out.  Write letters to the editor ..this is an easy and direct way that you as an individual can have a big impact on the public discourse that affects policy.  Contact your legislators and let them know that this technology has entered the food chain and the ecosystem without sufficient testing and without your permission.  Ask for a moratorium until it has been adequately tested.  Give volunteer hours or financial support to GMO FREE HAWAII.  Educate yourself and your neighbors about this topic, which is often left out of mainstream news media.
If you are a GARDENER, use GMO free seeds.  Ask your county officials if any GMO crops are being grown or tested in your area with crops (especially corn) that could contaminate your family's garden corn crop.  Test the papaya trees in your yard and chop down GMO contaminated trees.  Save GMO free seed by bagging a flower of a hermaphrodite tree that you have tested and found GMO free.  The seeds of that fruit will be GMO free trees, but may get GMO air contamination in their fruits.  Let your Cooperative Extension office, Master Gardener program, and County and State lawmakers know that you want to garden in a GMO Free Hawaii.
If you are a DOCTOR or healer, educate your patients about the health concerns related to GMO foods and living near GMO crops.  When diagnosing, consider effects of a change from GMO free to GMO ingredients in your patient's diet.  Demand that your local public health department track possible allergic and other responses to ingestion or aerosoliztion of these deadly genes.  These foods have never gone through the normal regulatory channels of animal testing, human testing and post market surveys.


What We Need to Fight the Global Elite ...                               
Initial Funding ( $150,000 )  will be used to achieve certain levels of hardware and acccessories

2012 Toyota Tundra 4X4 crew cab to reach over 60,000 acres of GMO farmland located on former plantation sugar & pineapple fields
Digital Cameras ( 2 CANON SLR EOS 7D bodies ) to document GMO activities w/various lenses wide angle, normal, zoom, telephoto
Digital Video Cameras ( 2 CANON XH-A1S Professional Camcorder )
Post Production Computers & Software to edit multimedia formats for DVD replication and duplication to educate the masses thru social media strategies
Parallel Marketing Projects that will be funded: media kits consisting of DVD's and printed literature
Sponsoring events to educate the public of the GMO movement



The Impact
Last year, GMO labeling passed every single county for Hawaii State Association of Counties except OAHU.  Resolution 12-138 urges University of Hawaii to study the link between neonicotinoid pesticides, gemetically modified organisms and the disappearance of the bees.  Recent studies in France led to a ban of GMO company SYNGENTA's Cruiser pesticide after confirming they contributed to the collapse of the bee colonies.  We need bees to pollinate our food and Hawaii is a leading exporter of Queen Bees worldwide.  The bees are dying, they are disappearing and we need to know why. Resolution 12-138 still has not been assigned a hearing and it was introduced in June 5, 2012.
We will never give up fighting GMO's.  We deserve the right to know what we are eating and whether or not it has been genetically modified.  We deserve to have natural food.  Hawaii and the world must stand up to fight the corporate greed of the multinational food conglomerates...

<p></p>
<p>I'm Daryl and I have a bit of a favour to ask which would <b>help me to help
 others</b>...But first I'm going to explain a little bit about my 
intentions, journey and dream!<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/694648/files/20140704130323-me_sill_bike.jpg?1404504203"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>In a nutshell on the 8th of July <b>I'm going to cycle over 1000miles</b> from England to Portugal promoting<b> sustainability</b> along the way. I will do this firstly via the symbolic act of cycling to Portugal, but I will also have CD's (seeds ;-) with inspiring talks by key players in the fight for sustainable futures that I have recorded from recent events and interviews to give to people along the way.</p>
<p><b>(I MADE IT IN 21 DAYS!!! Please scroll down to the bottom for pictures)</b></p>
<p><br/><b>If you don't ask...you don't get!</b><br/><br/>I have set up this appeal with the ambition to raise money to pay the fee's for a work placement opportunity I have been given with the Shipibo healers in the amazon rainforest in Peru. There I will get to live life in the jungle, Learn about sustainability jungle style, gain a deeper insight into different issues that we face in the world from the healers and the people directly affected. In particular, helping to <b>free people from addictions </b>and other <b>human conditions</b>. I will try to merge the deeper understanding that I hope to bring back, with the nature of work I have been doing over the years so far to help me get closer to my dream of a community-led <b>Life school.</b><br/><br/><b>Money donated</b> doesn't just help me get closer to my dream but goes straight to the healing center for development of facilities and programs. The money is also used to fund external projects fighting the problems that pressure the 
rainforest each day.<br/><br/>If you would like to know more about my journey, my motivations and my ultimate vision then please read on! =]</p>
<p><b>WARNING!</b> It's a bit of an essay...but all relevant to express my vision ;)<br/><br/><b>Fragments of my journey so far...</b></p>
<p>I'm from Yorkshire originally...A town called Doncaster. Those of you who know about Doncaster will know that it's not the nicest place in the world and my experience of it up until the age of 16 was quite challenging at times. I was a ""sweaty"" according to the majority of people. A ""sweaty"" was a name used to disrespect people who were into alternative culture...I had a 9inch Mohawk, a studded jacket and a skateboard and because of this I was chased and even beaten for being different. I couldn't understand why these people could act in such a way just because of a difference in appearance and music tastes...It is safe to say that I did not like these people at all!<br/><br/>By the way I'm not looking for sympathy here...It will all make sense as you read on! ;-)<br/><br/>I did really bad in my school exams...It didn't make sense to me to try and pack my head full of information (That it seemed likely I
would never use!) to recall on one day of my life to pass an exam...<br/><br/>Luckily that summer I went on an adventure week away and the leader of the trip saw potential in me and he encouraged me to enroll on a college course in outdoor education...So I did and it was the best decision I ever made!<br/>I loved this path so much that I followed the college course with a degree in outdoor education which I enjoyed in the beautiful land of Cornwall. <br/>During my journey of <b>outdoor education</b> I began to realise just how powerful outdoor education can be when used as a tool for <b>personal growth and for changing behaviour</b>. I wrote my dissertation on ""The use of outdoor education as a form of rehabilitation for behaviour"" and it all became clear. Through the work on my dissertation and learning how to implement this in the outdoor classroom I learned a lot about the kids I disliked so much for beating down on me for being a ""sweaty"".<br/><br/>I learned that it's not entirely their fault for acting in this way. It goes much deeper and behaviour of this kind is usually a result of <b>dysfunctional family life </b>and abuse at home. <br/><br/>After I finished my studies I began working within outdoor education and had the privilege to work at a few centres that specialise in working with children from disadvantaged backgrounds, who had <b>challenging behaviour</b> of some kind. For example I would often work with children who had been kicked out of every school they had been to, passed through many different foster homes and this was due to their behaviour. The way the children act and view the world is usually a result of their upbringing, which in most cases is <b>lacking in love, attention and provision</b> from their parents...if they have parents at all. In a lot of cases the parents couldn't provide for them because they had their own problems to deal with like <b>addiction, financial struggles, Psychological issues</b> (in-some cases they would resort to prostitution, gambling, drug dealing etc to fund their existence) and struggle to have the time and commitment for the huge responsibility of parenthood. </p>
<p>In a lot of cases children with challenging behaviour still live with their parents but unfortunately their parents tend not to be the greatest roll models. This could be because they may have fallen pregnant at an early age which then restricts opportunity for vital growth and the learning of <b>life lessons</b>. This can often result in parents bringing up children without skills and understandings to pass on to the children...The expression ""Kids having kids"" comes to mind in a lot of cases.<br/><br/>As you can probably see this can become a <b>vicious cycle</b> and there needs to be some form of interception. I believe that the best way to do this is through education and I'm talking about <b>life education</b>. It's clear in today's society that we are quickly forgetting how to look after ourselves, each other and also the beautiful planet that we inhabit.<br/><br/>Eventually I would like fulfill my dream of setting up a <b>life school. <br/></b></p>
<p>I'd like to see myself and as many inspiring individuals as possible to collectively come together to set up a <b>life skills center </b>to share knowledge and wisdom in all aspects of living and creating, in a way that is most harmonious with the planet.<br/><br/><b>But</b> before that I want to learn as much as I possibly can!<br/><br/><b>New found energy...</b><br/>Over the last 6 years I have had to deal with my own series of mistakes and problems which led to <b>self-destructive behaviour and addictions</b>. I always provided for myself and had a job etc but underneath the smile I had issues that I had a problem facing. I have been very fortunate to have led a very active and inquisitive lifestyle that paved way for vital life lessons. These lessons provided the <b>perfect insight</b> that I needed to really question the nature and the reality of my issues. This gave me a new perspective which allowed me to make the necessary changes to myself to kick the additions and bad habits without help and as of July I will have gone half a year free from my <b>Bane! :D<br/><br/>So basically</b>...<br/><br/>I want to use my new found <b>energy that I suppressed </b>for so long by being as active as I can in <b>ironing out the creases of today's world</b> and by taking the opportunity I have been given to go to the amazon to work alongside the Shipibo healers to gain deeper insight. I want to understand the problems we face today (addiction, self-worth, depression, attachments, depletion of natural resources, sustainability etc...) from the perspective of the humbly wise and knowledgeable <b>shamans</b> and the individuals who seek healing. <br/><br/>I'm hoping that pursuing this journey will provide me with a deeper understanding of the <b>human condition</b> and <b>sustainability</b> that I can combine with my understanding and use of outdoor education so far. It will help with future work with people of all walks of life but particularly the human condition and the interception of the <b>vicious cycle.</b> <br/><br/><b>I don't claim to have all the answers</b>...nor do I think I'm going to change the world with the journey ahead. However I feel that I have a responsibility to do everything possible with my energy and understandings to learn as much as I possibly can to help the beautiful planet and it's beautiful inhabitants in ANY way I can! <br/><b><br/>If you have made it this far...</b></p>
<p> Thank you for giving me the chance to share my vision and my journey that inspired me to embark on this adventure. If you share my vision and can contribute in any way I would be so so grateful!<br/><br/><b>You maybe thinking</b> ""Well that looks like an expensive bit of equipment you have there...why didn't you just use the money spent on that to pay for the fee's?!""<br/><br/>Almost all of the equipment that will enable me to complete this journey has been <b>kindly donated to me by amazing people who share my vision</b>...and the bike was a bit of a ""God send""...No way would I have been able to afford this bike new...Not even the 2nd hand ones I saw on ebay. Somehow on my tiresome search for the bike, I found ""the one I thought I'd never have"" lurking in the deep depths of a cycling forum for a fraction of the price!!! <br/><br/><b>More and more I get the feeling that the universe delivers just whats necessary, when necessary.<br/><br/></b>Most people may cancel the trip at this point if they had a bank balance anything like mine right now but everything has been happening so perfectly....<b>I'm prepared to take the risk!</b><br/><br/><b>I will also have reward packs for donations over £5 which are:<br/></b><br/>A choice of:<br/></p>

</div></div>","Hello! =D

I'm Daryl and I have a bit of a favour to ask which would help me to help
 others...But first I'm going to explain a little bit about my 
intentions, journey and dream!

In a nutshell on the 8th of July I'm going to cycle over 1000miles from England to Portugal promoting sustainability along the way. I will do this firstly via the symbolic act of cycling to Portugal, but I will also have CD's (seeds ;-) with inspiring talks by key players in the fight for sustainable futures that I have recorded from recent events and interviews to give to people along the way.
(I MADE IT IN 21 DAYS!!! Please scroll down to the bottom for pictures)
If you don't ask...you don't get!I have set up this appeal with the ambition to raise money to pay the fee's for a work placement opportunity I have been given with the Shipibo healers in the amazon rainforest in Peru. There I will get to live life in the jungle, Learn about sustainability jungle style, gain a deeper insight into different issues that we face in the world from the healers and the people directly affected. In particular, helping to free people from addictions and other human conditions. I will try to merge the deeper understanding that I hope to bring back, with the nature of work I have been doing over the years so far to help me get closer to my dream of a community-led Life school.Money donated doesn't just help me get closer to my dream but goes straight to the healing center for development of facilities and programs. The money is also used to fund external projects fighting the problems that pressure the 
rainforest each day.If you would like to know more about my journey, my motivations and my ultimate vision then please read on! =]
WARNING! It's a bit of an essay...but all relevant to express my vision ;)Fragments of my journey so far...
I'm from Yorkshire originally...A town called Doncaster. Those of you who know about Doncaster will know that it's not the nicest place in the world and my experience of it up until the age of 16 was quite challenging at times. I was a ""sweaty"" according to the majority of people. A ""sweaty"" was a name used to disrespect people who were into alternative culture...I had a 9inch Mohawk, a studded jacket and a skateboard and because of this I was chased and even beaten for being different. I couldn't understand why these people could act in such a way just because of a difference in appearance and music tastes...It is safe to say that I did not like these people at all!By the way I'm not looking for sympathy here...It will all make sense as you read on! ;-)I did really bad in my school exams...It didn't make sense to me to try and pack my head full of information (That it seemed likely I
would never use!) to recall on one day of my life to pass an exam...Luckily that summer I went on an adventure week away and the leader of the trip saw potential in me and he encouraged me to enroll on a college course in outdoor education...So I did and it was the best decision I ever made!I loved this path so much that I followed the college course with a degree in outdoor education which I enjoyed in the beautiful land of Cornwall. During my journey of outdoor education I began to realise just how powerful outdoor education can be when used as a tool for personal growth and for changing behaviour. I wrote my dissertation on ""The use of outdoor education as a form of rehabilitation for behaviour"" and it all became clear. Through the work on my dissertation and learning how to implement this in the outdoor classroom I learned a lot about the kids I disliked so much for beating down on me for being a ""sweaty"".I learned that it's not entirely their fault for acting in this way. It goes much deeper and behaviour of this kind is usually a result of dysfunctional family life and abuse at home. After I finished my studies I began working within outdoor education and had the privilege to work at a few centres that specialise in working with children from disadvantaged backgrounds, who had challenging behaviour of some kind. For example I would often work with children who had been kicked out of every school they had been to, passed through many different foster homes and this was due to their behaviour. The way the children act and view the world is usually a result of their upbringing, which in most cases is lacking in love, attention and provision from their parents...if they have parents at all. In a lot of cases the parents couldn't provide for them because they had their own problems to deal with like addiction, financial struggles, Psychological issues (in-some cases they would resort to prostitution, gambling, drug dealing etc to fund their existence) and struggle to have the time and commitment for the huge responsibility of parenthood. 
In a lot of cases children with challenging behaviour still live with their parents but unfortunately their parents tend not to be the greatest roll models. This could be because they may have fallen pregnant at an early age which then restricts opportunity for vital growth and the learning of life lessons. This can often result in parents bringing up children without skills and understandings to pass on to the children...The expression ""Kids having kids"" comes to mind in a lot of cases.As you can probably see this can become a vicious cycle and there needs to be some form of interception. I believe that the best way to do this is through education and I'm talking about life education. It's clear in today's society that we are quickly forgetting how to look after ourselves, each other and also the beautiful planet that we inhabit.Eventually I would like fulfill my dream of setting up a life school. 
I'd like to see myself and as many inspiring individuals as possible to collectively come together to set up a life skills center to share knowledge and wisdom in all aspects of living and creating, in a way that is most harmonious with the planet.But before that I want to learn as much as I possibly can!New found energy...Over the last 6 years I have had to deal with my own series of mistakes and problems which led to self-destructive behaviour and addictions. I always provided for myself and had a job etc but underneath the smile I had issues that I had a problem facing. I have been very fortunate to have led a very active and inquisitive lifestyle that paved way for vital life lessons. These lessons provided the perfect insight that I needed to really question the nature and the reality of my issues. This gave me a new perspective which allowed me to make the necessary changes to myself to kick the additions and bad habits without help and as of July I will have gone half a year free from my Bane! :DSo basically...I want to use my new found energy that I suppressed for so long by being as active as I can in ironing out the creases of today's world and by taking the opportunity I have been given to go to the amazon to work alongside the Shipibo healers to gain deeper insight. I want to understand the problems we face today (addiction, self-worth, depression, attachments, depletion of natural resources, sustainability etc...) from the perspective of the humbly wise and knowledgeable shamans and the individuals who seek healing. I'm hoping that pursuing this journey will provide me with a deeper understanding of the human condition and sustainability that I can combine with my understanding and use of outdoor education so far. It will help with future work with people of all walks of life but particularly the human condition and the interception of the vicious cycle. I don't claim to have all the answers...nor do I think I'm going to change the world with the journey ahead. However I feel that I have a responsibility to do everything possible with my energy and understandings to learn as much as I possibly can to help the beautiful planet and it's beautiful inhabitants in ANY way I can! If you have made it this far...
 Thank you for giving me the chance to share my vision and my journey that inspired me to embark on this adventure. If you share my vision and can contribute in any way I would be so so grateful!You maybe thinking ""Well that looks like an expensive bit of equipment you have there...why didn't you just use the money spent on that to pay for the fee's?!""Almost all of the equipment that will enable me to complete this journey has been kindly donated to me by amazing people who share my vision...and the bike was a bit of a ""God send""...No way would I have been able to afford this bike new...Not even the 2nd hand ones I saw on ebay. Somehow on my tiresome search for the bike, I found ""the one I thought I'd never have"" lurking in the deep depths of a cycling forum for a fraction of the price!!! More and more I get the feeling that the universe delivers just whats necessary, when necessary.Most people may cancel the trip at this point if they had a bank balance anything like mine right now but everything has been happening so perfectly....I'm prepared to take the risk!I will also have reward packs for donations over £5 which are:A choice of:


Dawning Dartington: Recordings of birds waking up that I recorded at Dartington gardens, Devon. (Tranquil listening/For use in music production).

Digital Desolation: Sounds of an empty factory...A sample pack that would sound great used within techno and other deep electronic music production.


Seeds of sustainability: Recordings of key speakers and authors on sustainable futures. Featuring Polly Higgins (A legal expert on the law of Ecocide and author of award-winning Eradicating Ecocide and Earth is our Business.),  Julian Pratt (Author of Stewardship Economy: Private Property without Private Ownership), Tim Williams (inspirational speaker and environmental activist) and others!


These will be downloadable by donators via the internet.Where the money goes...The money raised will go straight to paying only the placement fees so that I can pursue my self-initiated journey of education. How I will put this experience to use:

I will combine the new knowledge and understanding along with my personal experience to work in rehabilitation projects to help people overcome their addiction. 

Gaining experience in this field will compliment my current skill set and will allow me to help not just young people with challenging behavior but also to work with adults with addictions which is often a key factor within dysfunctional families.

I will hopefully be able to find the time to compile all that I learn and document into some kind of journal so that anybody interested can also benefit and learn from my educational journey.
I will be able to incorporate all knowledge and skills regarding permaculture, sustainability, diet, natural health care, mental health care and more into potential syllabus at the center for life skills which intend to make a reality of the future.


How the healing centre will use the money...The money then gets spent on developing the healing center and the programs they provide. It also provides funding for external community projects that help fight the problems that the rainforest and the inhabitants face.Read more about how they spend the money here:http://templeofthewayoflight.org/temple-info/do...

connection between the environment, technology and development forms the basis
of my teaching and research interests. Within this larger context, my  research carefully examines the global afterlives of digital technologies such as cell phones, computers and MP3 players . In other words, I look at what happens to your digital devices once you throw them away.<br/></p>
<p>I am asking for your support to publish my findings. <span>I have presented my work at various conferences in Europe and North America over the past few years.  A 
number of colleagues and mentors have repeatedly encouraged me to publish my findings 
in academic journals. <span><span><span><span>Unfortunately, I applied to a couple of post-doc 
grants but I did not get them (ironically because I do not have enough 
publications). This is why I am turning to you. I am looking for 
sponsors who will either gift a couple of hours of working time or lend 
me the money until I can get a job and pay you back.</span></span></span></span></span> I have drafts of six articles in various stages of completion.<br/></p>The story that emerged out of the
 two years of ethnographic and archival research I conducted is 
fascinatingly complex. It also makes important theoretical and 
methodological contributions to the fields of environmental sociology 
and science and technology studies. My research is not just academic, however. In a time
when countries across the globe are struggling to manage their discarded technologies, my
study  offers important clues to the challenges associated with
developing efficient and responsible e-waste management systems.<br/><br/><span><span>I really
 want to share my ideas and data with a wider audience. Moreover, I just
 
taught a class for masters students in the Environmental Governance 
Program at the University of <span><span><span>Freiburg</span></span>, and I realized that 
being a professor would be my dream job. Without more publications I don't stand a chance for an academic job or research grant.</span></span><span><span><span><br/><br/>I
 find it extremely awkward to ask for money, especially since I am aware
 that pretty much everyone has a legitimate reason to ask for funding. 
However, I am motivated to get my articles out, so I am 
swallowing my pride and asking for help.  I 
hope that nobody feels in any way obliged to contribute, though. </span></span></span></span><br/> <p><br/></p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration!</p>
<p>Djahane<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<span><span><span><span>I
 estimate that I need about 150 hours  to get my papers 
ready for submission.  </span></span></span></span>At the moment, we are living in Germany because Martin (my husband) was awarded a research grant by the European Union. Martin makes enough as a postdoc for the next 18 months to support our
 family. However, we can just cover our day-to-day living expenses. We 
cannot afford to hire a babysitter. Without more childcare, however, I don't have
 time to write. I will spend the money I will raise through this campaign will be spent on childcare and, to a lesser extend, on follow up research to complete my papers.<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My research examines the politics
and practices of contemporary management of waste from electrical and
electronic equipment (e-waste or WEEE) originating in Germany. Contrary to predictions that
the digital revolution would lead to less resource-intensive and thus more
environmentally sustainable societies, it is becoming increasingly apparent
that high-tech lifestyles are not as clean and green as many would like to
believe. In fact, global consumption of digital technologies such as personal
computers, cell phones and iPods is exacting significant environmental and
health costs. Through ethnographic and archival research this project
reconstructs how social actors, ranging from policymakers to multi-national
recycling firms to informal recyclers, transform discarded technologies once
they are placed on the curb in Germany. Drawing on this empirical work this
analysis shows how the environmental and social impact of a technological
artifact extends over its entire lifecycle. </p>
<p>Germany’s reputation as a model when it comes to
waste management and environmentalism more generally, coupled with its status
as Europe’s largest e-waste producer and exporter, make it a particularly
powerful site to understand the tensions and contradictions between national
attempts to address the problem of e-waste and the existence of globalized licit and illicit
e-waste networks that unequally distribute the pollution and wealth associated
with the recycling and reuse of discarded technologies across the globe.</p>
<p>Located at the intersection of Science and
Technology Studies and Development Sociology, this project integrates, builds
on and extends scholarship in these two complementary fields to address the
issue of e-waste in Germany. Such an integration is necessary to analyze how
the afterlife of electrical and electronic equipment is shaped by and
reinforces uneven global political, economic and ecological relationships in a

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Djahane Salehabadi and I graduated with a PhD in Development Sociology (and a minor in Science and Technology Studies) from Cornell University in May 2014. The
connection between the environment, technology and development forms the basis
of my teaching and research interests. Within this larger context, my  research carefully examines the global afterlives of digital technologies such as cell phones, computers and MP3 players . In other words, I look at what happens to your digital devices once you throw them away.
I am asking for your support to publish my findings. I have presented my work at various conferences in Europe and North America over the past few years.  A 
number of colleagues and mentors have repeatedly encouraged me to publish my findings 
in academic journals. Unfortunately, I applied to a couple of post-doc 
grants but I did not get them (ironically because I do not have enough 
publications). This is why I am turning to you. I am looking for 
sponsors who will either gift a couple of hours of working time or lend 
me the money until I can get a job and pay you back. I have drafts of six articles in various stages of completion.The story that emerged out of the
 two years of ethnographic and archival research I conducted is 
fascinatingly complex. It also makes important theoretical and 
methodological contributions to the fields of environmental sociology 
and science and technology studies. My research is not just academic, however. In a time
when countries across the globe are struggling to manage their discarded technologies, my
study  offers important clues to the challenges associated with
developing efficient and responsible e-waste management systems.I really
 want to share my ideas and data with a wider audience. Moreover, I just
 
taught a class for masters students in the Environmental Governance 
Program at the University of Freiburg, and I realized that 
being a professor would be my dream job. Without more publications I don't stand a chance for an academic job or research grant.I
 find it extremely awkward to ask for money, especially since I am aware
 that pretty much everyone has a legitimate reason to ask for funding. 
However, I am motivated to get my articles out, so I am 
swallowing my pride and asking for help.  I 
hope that nobody feels in any way obliged to contribute, though.  
Thanks for your consideration!
Djahane   What I Need & What You Get
I
 estimate that I need about 150 hours  to get my papers 
ready for submission.  At the moment, we are living in Germany because Martin (my husband) was awarded a research grant by the European Union. Martin makes enough as a postdoc for the next 18 months to support our
 family. However, we can just cover our day-to-day living expenses. We 
cannot afford to hire a babysitter. Without more childcare, however, I don't have
 time to write. I will spend the money I will raise through this campaign will be spent on childcare and, to a lesser extend, on follow up research to complete my papers.   The Impact
My research examines the politics
and practices of contemporary management of waste from electrical and
electronic equipment (e-waste or WEEE) originating in Germany. Contrary to predictions that
the digital revolution would lead to less resource-intensive and thus more
environmentally sustainable societies, it is becoming increasingly apparent
that high-tech lifestyles are not as clean and green as many would like to
believe. In fact, global consumption of digital technologies such as personal
computers, cell phones and iPods is exacting significant environmental and
health costs. Through ethnographic and archival research this project
reconstructs how social actors, ranging from policymakers to multi-national
recycling firms to informal recyclers, transform discarded technologies once
they are placed on the curb in Germany. Drawing on this empirical work this
analysis shows how the environmental and social impact of a technological
artifact extends over its entire lifecycle. 
Germany’s reputation as a model when it comes to
waste management and environmentalism more generally, coupled with its status
as Europe’s largest e-waste producer and exporter, make it a particularly
powerful site to understand the tensions and contradictions between national
attempts to address the problem of e-waste and the existence of globalized licit and illicit
e-waste networks that unequally distribute the pollution and wealth associated
with the recycling and reuse of discarded technologies across the globe.
Located at the intersection of Science and
Technology Studies and Development Sociology, this project integrates, builds
on and extends scholarship in these two complementary fields to address the
issue of e-waste in Germany. Such an integration is necessary to analyze how
the afterlife of electrical and electronic equipment is shaped by and
reinforces uneven global political, economic and ecological relationships in a
postcolonial context. Equally important, this work engages with recent debates
in the social sciences on the boundaries between technology, society and
ecology, the co-production of the social and the material, as well as the
relationship between globalization and the environment, and reworks and extends
key concepts in sociology and the social studies such as fetishization, the
black box, technological systems and regimes of perceptibility. It also
introduces new concepts including the notion of “unmaking” and “the green box.

<div>                    Hello Indiegogo!! We are SLIE or Sustainable Living and Interconnected Education, a Non-Profit organization, built around, green or sustainable living, education in the community and of course nature! We are a family of 4 who have decided the best way to spread the word about living green is to be a living example ourselves. We started SLIE as a means of outreach and connection to the community around us to interact with like minded individuals and share our knowledge and experience with one another. We have just re-located to Lehigh Acres, FL and are currently converting our thirsty lawn into a food producing, lush garden, with TONS of Non-GMO,pesticide free AND Organic plants to live off of. We will expand into aquaponics, rain water collection, and small farm animals to aid in food production in the future. LIKE us on Facebook to keep up on all our recent activities, and future workshops for when you are in the SW Florida area <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SustainableLivingNonProfit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>.</div>
<div>                   At this point, we work with community members, and FGCU (Florida Gulf Coast University) students as volunteers, however the school has just recently changed their criteria for approved service learning organizations, requiring that they have their 501(c)3 Non-Profit tax status. Despite this drawback, we are determined to acquire the status we need, and continue our work with the students, and members of the community. This is our main goal of the campaign. The 501(c)3 status is essentially just a payment that must be made each year to offset the taxes 501(c)3 Non-Profit organizations are exempt from.  The second portion of the campaign is to create a sign for our property to show the world where we are and what we do! (This is an afterthought since the minimum campaign amount is $500, but the 501(c)3 status is only $400, and we decided this would be a great use of the extra funds we have left over.) We purchase almost all our plants, gardening tools and project materials ourselves, so we are a bit stretched for funds at this time, which is where YOU the Indiegogo crowd comes in!</div>

</div><div> <p>                     As I said, our main goal for the campaign is to get the funds we need to become a 501(c)3 Non-Profit organization. We ARE currently a non-profit organization, essentially we just aren't tax free, (it costs more money). Having this tax status, will help us in our work of sustainable teachings and workshops, by working with other businesses to secure material donations, volunteer hours, and of course the tax free status when we purchase materials ourselves. Of the $500 we need, $400 will immediately go toward our 501(c)3 status. The remaining $100, should we meet our goal, will go toward the creation of a sign for our property, proclaiming for any who see it who we are and what we do. Anything made above and beyond our goal will go straight toward the creation of our sustainable property, mainly plants, soil, building materials for raised planters, drip irrigation, rain barrels, etc. We have MANY projects planned for the future, and this is one of the only things holding us back from jumping in head first.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>                 The perks we offer aren't huge and flashy as some are on this site, after all, we are only a 2 person organization (3 if you count our 2 children as 1/2 a person each, they are 1 and 5 years old) but we hope you'll appreciate them, since we so appreciate your interest and assistance! Above all our goal as an education based organization is to share knowledge with any and all people who are willing to learn. We will put together a personalized, handwritten thank you note as one of our perks. Another will be heirloom seeds, to start your own food producing garden, and a third will be a small, but information packed guide filled with a Florida planting chart, and small things ANYONE can do toward the goal of living a healthy, sustainable life.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>                       If by some chance we don't meet our goal of $500, the money will go into our savings, until we can make up the difference and get our 501(c)3 status, as it is currently the main goal of our organization.</p>

We began our land search 2 months ago and we finally found a suitable area to farm. Its close proximity to the city allows volunteers easy access to bicycle there or take local bus transportation. We now need your help to make our dream of making a large traditional heirloom seed garden a reality. WHAT IS ECO RURALIS? - A non-profit NGO that supports traditional and organic peasant farming. Our office is based in Cluj-Napoca, located in the Transylvania
region of Romania. In 2009, a group of small family farmers came
together from several regions of the country to form our
organization. Participation in Eco Ruralis has grown to include
250 families and over 500 members altogether. Members and staff have formed strong bonds and what brings us together is our mutual passion for continuing small-scale sustainable agriculture with the use of heirloom seeds. Our organization truly believes that seed sovereignty provides food sovereignty.OUR PROBLEM - Less use of traditional seeds produces less healthy, organic food. Many rules and regulations have limited the use of traditional seeds. Large,
often
multinational corporations produce and
promote 
lots of hybrid seeds and GMO's in general, and
their control of the seed market limits the use of
traditional seeds. The health and environmental impact caused by this has been documented very well. This affects food security and we are fighting back.OUR SOLUTION - To plant, collect and distribute as many heirloom seeds as possible!  Many of our members save their seeds and send them to us after harvesting. At the end of each season, we build up a bigger inventory and distribute more and more. We will also give more people an opportunity to gain gardening experience and educate them on how they can save seeds. Farming is direct action - 90% of our garden will be used for seeds, 10% will be used for vegetables.EXPERIENCE - We have multiplied traditional seeds at a university garden over the past 3 years. A local professor of agro-biodiversity works with Eco Ruralis staff
and volunteers as well as agronomy students to multiply and collect
heirloom seeds at their university. This experience has been truly beneficial, providing us with useful skills for seed saving and cultivation. It made us realize what we could do with our own larger garden. That chapter of our story will begin soon :)

<p>
</p>
<p>It
may sound strange, but Bokashi composting has changed my life.</p>
<p>I
graduated from Northern Arizona University with a B.S. degree in Political
Science in 2010. There I realized the power of grassroots movements and
sustainable agriculture. Farmers became my heroes. So shortly after graduating,
I moved to Maui to become an organic farmer.</p>
<p>Magically,
Bokashi composting came into my life and it has become my tool to ignite waste
recycling.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1167465/files/20150122111517-1897828_10152672962043965_8038242280545829325_n.jpg?1421954117"" src="""" style=""width: 528px; height: 528px;""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I
was once overwhelmed with the weight of the world’s problems. Bokashi allows me
to reduce my waste in half effortlessly, and grow bigger plants, better, and
faster, and heal our soil! I feel empowered and determined.</span></p>
<p>Bokashi
composting has become critical for New Zealand’s success, and I want to see the
Bokashi rEvolution be embraced by the U.S. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>""Compost
Evolved: The Zero Food Waste Culture"" is a 45 minute documentary about the food
waste recycling movement in New Zealand. In 2002, New Zealand became the first country IN THE WORLD to
adopt a national policy of Zero Waste.</p>
<p>We
will explore our dynamic relation with waste, food, and consumption. I believe
we are at a critical point in human civilization where we can radically change
some of the world's biggest challenges. Every successful grassroots movement I
studied started with just one or a few people. <b>Our individual actions make a
difference-and Bokashi can help.</b> <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div> <p><b>Here's to composting like a MOTHER-EARTHER!</b></p></div>","""Compost Evolved"" in a Nutshell


It
may sound strange, but Bokashi composting has changed my life.
I
graduated from Northern Arizona University with a B.S. degree in Political
Science in 2010. There I realized the power of grassroots movements and
sustainable agriculture. Farmers became my heroes. So shortly after graduating,
I moved to Maui to become an organic farmer.
Magically,
Bokashi composting came into my life and it has become my tool to ignite waste
recycling.

I
was once overwhelmed with the weight of the world’s problems. Bokashi allows me
to reduce my waste in half effortlessly, and grow bigger plants, better, and
faster, and heal our soil! I feel empowered and determined.
Bokashi
composting has become critical for New Zealand’s success, and I want to see the
Bokashi rEvolution be embraced by the U.S. 



""Compost
Evolved: The Zero Food Waste Culture"" is a 45 minute documentary about the food
waste recycling movement in New Zealand. In 2002, New Zealand became the first country IN THE WORLD to
adopt a national policy of Zero Waste.
We
will explore our dynamic relation with waste, food, and consumption. I believe
we are at a critical point in human civilization where we can radically change
some of the world's biggest challenges. Every successful grassroots movement I
studied started with just one or a few people. Our individual actions make a
difference-and Bokashi can help. 


How
would YOUR community thrive with an exciting, dynamic, and fun documentary
showcasing pioneering zero waste techniques for restaurants, schools, community
gardens, businesses, local government and urban planners?

 This documentary is about giving you the tools you need to become
an Earth Super Hero and inspire your sustainable community.
*We will do a school version video and another catered to adults.
   What We Need & What You Get 
I need to raise
$7,000 to make this documentary radical.
The Breakdown:

$2,000 for editing (the same editors who filmed the
     Indiegogo video-they are amazing)

$2300 towards equipment, Zach's
     travel and expertise. (Who is Zach? Zach was my Backcountry Crew
     Leader from when we worked for the Southwest Conservation Corps trekking
     the wilderness, clearing trail, and soaking up the call of the wild
     together. This guy is hysterical, extremely intelligent, and helped first
     ignite my revolutionary spirit.  He will be filming while I
     interview.)

$1,500 for a rental car (we will be camping along the road
     trip!)
$800 for equipment backup items
$500 for YOUR awesome gifts and shipping

If we don't hit our desired goal, funds will go towards your gifts (of course), editing, and transportation.
You Get:

To make a movie!
Bumper or Bike Stickers
Bokashi and instructions on how to compost food scraps
Bokashi Compost Workshops
Super awesome ""Compost Evolved"" trucker hat
Your access to the film!



  The Impact
Your support really matters. We are a bootstrap, lean-mean filming machine.
Your help will enable me reach more schools, universities, meet with legislators, businesses, gardens, and to other states. It is my mission to share sustainable solutions and continue to build on this grassroots movement. 

I won't give up knowing we have solutions at our grasp, and I hope you won't either. 
This film will be accessible for you so you can pioneer a compost evolution in your community! This documentary WILL be radical and game-changing.
  Risks & Challenges Our flights have been booked and the rental car will be very soon. We are going to make this film. However, there are some risks and challenges involved. 
We are interviewing as many power players as possible (and working with their schedules) We are working with local filming students in case we experience equipment failures or issues.
This is my first film, yet I am no stranger to the stage or camera. Zach and I work with synergy and will incorporate copious amounts of humor, creativity, beauty, and excitement.

<p>             We are <strong>anxious</strong> and sometimes <strong>overwhelmed </strong>about the future of our planet.

<p>          However, we feel absolutely compelled to do something important. We are offering a year of our lives to learn as much as we can about how to prepare for the future. We want to help others, and share our experiences for the benefit of everyone. Therein lies our motivaton for this trip. To learn, to give, and to share, in the hopes of inspiring and empowering ourselves and others to be agents of positive change. </p>
<p>           For years, we have learned about complicated and distressing global problems. We do not believe our modern way of life will sustain us through the tough times ahead. </p>

Our lessons will help others make changes in their lives and their communities to be better prepared for the future. 
How we will share:

Develop a book or short documentary available online highlighting the stories we collect and our insights

No one can solve global problems alone, and our final product will be a resource to those hoping to create a brighter future. 
 
How you can help us make a difference
Our greatest need is for a vehicle!
 
Our dream van!
      A vehicle like this one would give us the most flexibility to fulfill our dreams. 
We hope to purchase a used diesel vehicle, like a Westfalia or camper truck, to run on biodiesel. This vehicle will be our home all over the country, so we are looking for something reliable. We will also need funds for fuel, food, and supplies. 
An estimated breakdown:
$7,000-$10,000 for the vehicle 
(based on available options on Craigslist)
$1,500-$2,000 for sustainable food
$2,000 for biodiesel
(Roughly 8,000 miles at about 17 MPG at an average of $4.10/gal)
= $10,500- $14,000  
You might ask, given this breakdown, why we set our fundraising limit at $8,000? We are certainly hoping to raise well over $10,000, but will recieve a higher percentage of the money we raise from Indiegogo if we meet our goal. Also, we are determined to make it work with whatever money we manage to fundraise.
Thankfully, biodiesel is available all over the country! It will take some careful planning and some extra fuel tanks to make sure we never get stranded, but we are up for the challenge.

<p>We are currently fundraising to rent billboards across Canada starting in Ontario that will empower the Canadian public with many of the truthful and important facts about our environment and the government that the media can't or won't provide. It is our hope is that a well informed public will pressure the government, the media, and the international oil and gas industries to:</p>
<ol>
<li> Re-establish Canada's respect and protections for our environment</li>
<li> Prioritize more sustainable-earth business practices</li>
<li> Protect and respect everyones right to clean water, clean air and healthy   families</li>
<li> Begin to rebuild the Nation to Nation relatioship between First Nations and Canadians.</li>

<p>It costs approximately between $1400-$2000 to rent a large, horizontal billboard in Hamilton, Ontario for four weeks. We will start with the goal of one billboard and with your help we will achieve this, raise awareness and continue on raising funds for many more billboards, first in Ontario and then across Canada.

<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Many people take so many things for granted everyday, I have to admit that I did too. I did until i took a trip one year ago that changed my views on a lot of things. When you hear me say we take things for granted what do you think? Our cars, our homes, or even our cell phones? One thing that probably doesn't come to your mind is water, such an easily accesible thing to us yet we almost never realize that there are people all over the world who dont have the benefit of flipping a faucet and having water endlessly come out! Like i said before I didnt know I took this for granted until I took a trip that canged that. The trip was to Haiti. The purpose of this trip was to bring clean drinking water to the Haitians with an organization called Raincatchers. While I was there i got to spend time with the people there and see how they lived. Watching them have to walk miles and miles for something that we waste daily while we brush our teeth, water our grass, and wash our cars with this precious thing they call water. The purpose of this trip is to install a gutter filtration system; that catches and funnels rain water through a filter into a 50gallon barrel for them to drink thats right outside of their huts!

It's where we run, picnic, celebrate, work, sail, and live. As a city we've invested a ton of money, time, and passion into making it the waterfront we deserve. But now the planned Island Airport expansion threatens all of that. </span></p>
<p>As a revitalized Queens Quay opens again on June 19/20 with big fanfare and a huge festival, NoJetsTO will stage a massive and creative protest on the lake on June 20th at 1PM near the foot of Rees Street. With people from across the city celebrating our waterfront together with politicians and the media, we will send a strong message that our waterfront is a place for people - not jets.</p>
<p>That's where you come in: with your help we will be able to make it a big protest that will draw eyeballs and public attention. The more you give, the more kayaks and boats we will put on the water. It's that simple.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>It's all about scale. Your donation will help us:</p> <ul> <li>Rent boats, canoes and kayaks and assemble a flotilla of #kayaktivists - and you could be in one of them!</li> <li>Equip our entire flotilla with NoJetsTO flags and banners for the protest.</li> <li>Get the word out on social media to make this protest as big and fun as it can be.</li>
<li>In return for your generous help, you can get NoJetsTO gear or join us on the water either in a kayak or sailboat.</li>
<li>There's more: if you pitch in more you can even dine with luminary and urban designer Ken Greenberg or get a collector's item photo print from Ed Burtynsky peer Jim Panou.</li>
<li>Any funds left over from the boat protest will fund our ongoing grassroots campaign.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With your help, we will make our boat protest a big splash when Queens Quay opens again and all eyes will be on our waterfront:</p> <ul> <li>A big and fun protest will impress folks at the opening festivities and those watching CP24 &amp; Co. at home.</li> <li>City Councillors will be reminded that our waterfront is for people, not jets.</li> <li>We will get our message out there that this fight is about nothing less than the future of our waterfront.</li>
<li>We've staged a similar (but smaller) protest last year - drawing media attention and municipal hopefuls like Olivia Chow and Joe Cressy. So we know what we are doing - this protest will just be much bigger and more fun.</li>

It's where we run, picnic, celebrate, work, sail, and live. As a city we've invested a ton of money, time, and passion into making it the waterfront we deserve. But now the planned Island Airport expansion threatens all of that. 
As a revitalized Queens Quay opens again on June 19/20 with big fanfare and a huge festival, NoJetsTO will stage a massive and creative protest on the lake on June 20th at 1PM near the foot of Rees Street. With people from across the city celebrating our waterfront together with politicians and the media, we will send a strong message that our waterfront is a place for people - not jets.
That's where you come in: with your help we will be able to make it a big protest that will draw eyeballs and public attention. The more you give, the more kayaks and boats we will put on the water. It's that simple.   What We Need & What You Get It's all about scale. Your donation will help us:  Rent boats, canoes and kayaks and assemble a flotilla of #kayaktivists - and you could be in one of them! Equip our entire flotilla with NoJetsTO flags and banners for the protest. Get the word out on social media to make this protest as big and fun as it can be.
In return for your generous help, you can get NoJetsTO gear or join us on the water either in a kayak or sailboat.
There's more: if you pitch in more you can even dine with luminary and urban designer Ken Greenberg or get a collector's item photo print from Ed Burtynsky peer Jim Panou.
Any funds left over from the boat protest will fund our ongoing grassroots campaign.    The Impact With your help, we will make our boat protest a big splash when Queens Quay opens again and all eyes will be on our waterfront:  A big and fun protest will impress folks at the opening festivities and those watching CP24 & Co. at home. City Councillors will be reminded that our waterfront is for people, not jets. We will get our message out there that this fight is about nothing less than the future of our waterfront.
We've staged a similar (but smaller) protest last year - drawing media attention and municipal hopefuls like Olivia Chow and Joe Cressy. So we know what we are doing - this protest will just be much bigger and more fun.

  Other Ways You Can Help If you are not in the position to contribute financially, there are other ways for you to support a jet-free waterfront.

<p>The BroodMinder-W is a professional-grade beehive scale developed specifically for the backyard apiarist. The BroodMinder-W will allow you to track changes in the weight of your hive, giving you evidence of important factors such as brood growth, honey flow, winter honey stores, and swarming.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<h3><b><b>What We Need</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Achieving a low cost requires purchasing components in
high volumes. Our initial production run will be 500 units and the capital
outlay is around $50,000 for materials, tooling, and setup. Because our company is financed by the heart and not
a venture capital company, we need your help to make this possible.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>What You Get</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>It’s simple.  For $149, you get a beehive scale and the
satisfaction that you are contributing to the beekeeping knowledge base.

</p>
<p><span>While we believe this is an excellent value at $149, our target price was initially $99. We
still plan to reach that target in the
future through higher production volumes. However, we have decided to use
higher quality, American-designed weight sensors rather <span>than
the ultra-low cost, mass produced weight sensors available from China.  This factor, and the high-quality white oak
and aluminum casings, increased our production cost significantly.</span></span></p>
<p>We will be releasing the scales in batches, so
you can choose when you would like to receive yours. Just be sure to note the

<p><span>We are also offering a community support perk. This was
a successful component of our first campaign. You can donate $50 (or more) that

<p style=""font-size: 11pt;"">For many years, people lived in ignorance of how the environment was being harmed by their waste.

As the waste was capsuled it didn’t pose an immediate threat to the environment. Therefore many companies took the easy way out and sank their problem to the bottom of the sea.

Previously, nuclear waste was carelessly put into containers that got disposed into the seas. Probably people thought the barrels would hold for that long as well...
What is even worse is that these containers have become very hard to find as they've been pushed around by currents and covered by the sea bed.
For instance, lost somewhere outside the coast of Sundsvall, Sweden, are 20 000 barrels containing mercury. 
What's hidden in the water close to you?

What led up to this mess
For many years, people lived in ignorance of how the environment was being harmed by their waste. In a time when rules regarding waste handling either weren’t present or not followed in practice, the seas were considered a convenient dumping site for all kinds of waste. More so, marine dumping was the recommended way to “take care” of chemical waste. For companies handling toxic chemicals it was much cheaper to just fill their waste up in containers and sink them, rather than having to pay for costly secure storage. As the waste was capsuled it didn’t pose an immediate threat to the environment. Therefore many companies took the easy way out and sank their problem to the bottom of the sea. Noone will ever find out, they probably thought. Unfortunately, as time has passed the containers have started to corrode and we are now in a race against time to take care of them before an environmental disaster occurs. This is where Naiad comes in.
The project team



Naiad began a bit over a year ago with 18 Master students from Mälardalen University, Sweden. They took the project a long way but is still uncompleted. This year 12 master students, majoring in robotics and intelligent embedded systems, continues with the project aiming to finish the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). 

Project goal
The long term plan for Naiad is to use a shoal of AUVs to systematically locate hazardous objects at the bottom of (at first) the Baltic Sea to secure a healthy environment for this and future generations. 

A shoal hunting for waste
The first step towards this goal is to develop a prototype, and that’s what you make possible by contributing to our project. The prototype will be used as a testing platform for further research. To put Naiad through some good tests, we’re aiming to compete in the 2015 editions of the RoboSub international AUV competition. This attracts the top schools from all over the world, so the competition will be tough. Naiad builds upon the experience of two previous team from Mälardalen University, Project VASA, which won the “Best Craftsmanship” award at RoboSub 2012 and the last team that began the Naiad project.
The robots will communicate via acoustic modems
Why crowdfunding?
Even though we are more aware of environmental issues today, people tend to forget about problems that they can’t see, until they blow up big time. We want to make people aware of this problem while we still have the chance to do something about it. Therefore we decided to take this opportunity to not only get funding from the crowd, but to vastly spread the word as well. So, if you care about the ocean and feel for this project, we really hope that you help us by sharing this campaign to all your friends.

to promote critical thinking style approaches to social problems. He hopes to

Wyoming, some 10 years ago.<br/><br/><i style="""">“We’re really proud

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Organic Soul is looking to take the web by storm, pulling in
new audiences from around the world to start a truly global community. To do
this, Organic Soul must redevelop its web site in addition to hiring a freelnace staff to
manage, produce, and publish content that is both informative and engaging. The
site must also attract users in a fashion that is creative; as the web becomes
saturated with content, it’s crucial for successful ideas to stand out and
produce something outside the norm.<br/><br/>Donations will go to three major pools of funding: website
development and maintenance, content production and management, and community
outreach/marketing development. Ideally, the site will be able to pull in
larger sponsorships, and eventually, the community will drive the site,
removing the need for donation-based funding. Already, the site has posted a
34.4% monthly average unique visitor increase with little to no cost marketing.
All in all, the site has made a <span style="""">total
jump of 213% (roughly 14000 users) over a 5-month period.<br/><br/>This proves that
Organic Soul, its mission, and its values are acting as a clarion call for
people concerned with their health and who are attuned to the world and its
problems. The success so far, however, is just a drop in the bucket: to be
truly successful, the site must continue to expand and offer unique avenues for
users to engage with their peers. Spreading information on new ways to engage
in education, holistic health care, and community togetherness is the means by
which we will achieve a better functioning society, nation, and world as a

saturated with content, it’s crucial for successful ideas to stand out and
produce something outside the norm.Donations will go to three major pools of funding: website
development and maintenance, content production and management, and community
outreach/marketing development. Ideally, the site will be able to pull in
larger sponsorships, and eventually, the community will drive the site,
removing the need for donation-based funding. Already, the site has posted a
34.4% monthly average unique visitor increase with little to no cost marketing.
All in all, the site has made a total
jump of 213% (roughly 14000 users) over a 5-month period.This proves that
Organic Soul, its mission, and its values are acting as a clarion call for
people concerned with their health and who are attuned to the world and its
problems. The success so far, however, is just a drop in the bucket: to be
truly successful, the site must continue to expand and offer unique avenues for
users to engage with their peers. Spreading information on new ways to engage
in education, holistic health care, and community togetherness is the means by
which we will achieve a better functioning society, nation, and world as a
whole. 
 
So, what’s in it for the donors? 
 
Every donor will have access to our unique list of perks displayed next to this listing.Above all, donors get the satisfaction of knowing they are
contributing to a grass roots campaign with world-wide ambitions. It is both of
the creators’ dream to be able to provide a real platform for change, and they
confidently believe in their project. For supporting that, we thank you. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Organic Soul is just that – a movement that requires its
users to help it grow organically. Spreading news about the site by word of
mouth, social networking, newsletters, or any other means is the best thing our
supporters can do. Get your friends, family and loved ones involved! Be sure to
get involved yourself! Ask us questions, join our discussions, and express your
opinions!Finally, Organic Soul is also always looking for
collaborators to come on board as content providers. Whether it’s a great
organic dish or a unique look at urban development, we’d love to hear your
ideas. We strongly believe the seed of one good idea can turn into the reality
of a revolution; let’s get that seed planted!If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please
do not hesitate to contact us.
 
With love,

just a couple of things I have done. I was recognized by the Wall Street

ISV is an internationally
recognized and awarded organization that appoints university students from the
U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. to various countries around the world in
an effort to impact entire communities and endangered habitats in need. 


The Impact

While on
my environmental conservation program, Iâ€™ll receive hands-on, practical
experience supporting such issues as endangered species preservation or habitat
restoration, which will strengthen my understanding of the world at large and
lead me on a path of ecological conservation to impact our world for years to
come. Past ISV volunteers have rescued sea turtles, rehabilitated
cheetahs, and assisted with reforestation and organic farming efforts, among
other assignments. With your help, I
will be able to broaden my awareness of environmental issues and
sustainability, as well as aid in the safekeeping of flora and fauna. If we don't care for the earth we live on, there won't be one anymore.


What We Need & What You Get

I am so excited to have an
opportunity to assist others in the world, but, as you may know, international
travel can be somewhat costly. This is why Iâ€™m asking for your help. I would genuinely appreciate, however large or small, any financial support
you might offer.

Your
donation will go toward my program and travel costs (approx. $5,000), covering
my accommodations, most meals, project materials and support, ground
transportation, and tour guidance.

The video I have provided mentions an additional trip to the beautiful Fiji, however I will not be doing that so you can be reassured that your money is going towards making a difference in the world and not a vacation.

<p class=""p2"">The brand <span class=""s2""><strong>Construção Sustentável®</strong></span> belongs to <span class=""s2""><strong>Bluecity Construction Ltd</strong></span>, a private company that builds on the experience gathered over more than 20 years, centred on designing, promoting, selling, monitoring and managing some of the benchmark buildings that flag sustainable construction in the Mediterranean Climate Region.

Check out the <span class=""s2""><strong>Company Profile</strong></span><span class=""s3""><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Why is Sustainable Construction relevant?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">If you live in a home that is ill adapted to the prevalent climate, you won’t enjoy <strong>healthy</strong> and <strong>comfortable</strong> indoor conditions – often you won’t achieve health and comfort, even when you try to create these conditions artificially.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Also, almost 40% of the energy produced world wide is used to make buildings inhabitable – how can this statistic make sense when applied to the Mediterranean Climate - where average temperatures are so favourable to people?</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Isn’t Sustainable Construction expensive?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Did you know that in some continents (Europe as an example) a building will, on average, double its construction costs in between 7 to 20 years? So the answer to this question is another more pertinent one: can we afford not to mainstream Sustainable Construction?</p>
<p class=""p2"">Economy is an important facet of sustainable construction and it is addressed holistically – buildings need to minimize their dependency on finite resources by integrating efficiency by design and by substituting the inevitable demand with renewable resources.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Why does it cost so much to translate an e-book and create an e-tool?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">We've heard this question a couple of times too many now, and decided to address it. We are not paying ourselves any wage from the $20,000 we are pitching for as we will have a product we can sell as a result. <strong>Whom we do have to pay are the experts we will outsource to for the total quality of the products.</strong> This is the full breakdown of the $20k:</p>
<p><strong>e-Book</strong></p>
<p>Translation of the book by experts (translating and revising) - $2K</p>
<p>Experts to revise new technical contents for the new chapter - $1K</p>
<p>Graphic designer - $1K</p>
<p><strong>e-Tool of Thumb</strong> </p>
<p>The technical programme for the questions answers and recommendations, experts in construction, energy, water and indoor air quality - $10K</p>
<p>Web designer - 2K</p>
<p>Graphic Designer - 1,2K</p>
<p>Photos - 1K</p>
<p>Indiegogo fees - 1,8K</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Where do People come into the Sustainable Construction Equation?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">The spaces we inhabit should enrich our lives! They should enhance the scope of our thoughts and experiences and facilitate our relations with the people we share them with. They should equally allow us to effectively and freely perform our daily functions, while engaging positively with our local community.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>How can we implement Sustainable Construction in the existing built environment?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">This is why the Sustainable Construction® Team has developed the book and is now pitching for the “<strong>39 Steps:</strong> <strong>Sustainable Construction and Refurbishment</strong> in the Mediterranean Climate” project. To overcome one of the main barriers to mainstreaming Sustainable Construction: the availability of information to make the right decisions!</p>

Did you know that in some continents (Europe as an example) a building will, on average, double its construction costs in between 7 to 20 years? So the answer to this question is another more pertinent one: can we afford not to mainstream Sustainable Construction?
Economy is an important facet of sustainable construction and it is addressed holistically – buildings need to minimize their dependency on finite resources by integrating efficiency by design and by substituting the inevitable demand with renewable resources.
Why does it cost so much to translate an e-book and create an e-tool?
We've heard this question a couple of times too many now, and decided to address it. We are not paying ourselves any wage from the $20,000 we are pitching for as we will have a product we can sell as a result. Whom we do have to pay are the experts we will outsource to for the total quality of the products. This is the full breakdown of the $20k:
e-Book
Translation of the book by experts (translating and revising) - $2K
Experts to revise new technical contents for the new chapter - $1K
Graphic designer - $1K
e-Tool of Thumb 
The technical programme for the questions answers and recommendations, experts in construction, energy, water and indoor air quality - $10K
Web designer - 2K
Graphic Designer - 1,2K
Photos - 1K
Indiegogo fees - 1,8K
Where do People come into the Sustainable Construction Equation?
The spaces we inhabit should enrich our lives! They should enhance the scope of our thoughts and experiences and facilitate our relations with the people we share them with. They should equally allow us to effectively and freely perform our daily functions, while engaging positively with our local community.
How can we implement Sustainable Construction in the existing built environment?
This is why the Sustainable Construction® Team has developed the book and is now pitching for the “39 Steps: Sustainable Construction and Refurbishment in the Mediterranean Climate” project. To overcome one of the main barriers to mainstreaming Sustainable Construction: the availability of information to make the right decisions!
What does the Perk “e-Book's double fold thank you page as a contributor” look like?
Your name will appear among 300 contributors’ names in the “Thank You” page – look below.

How will the Sustainable Construction® Team invest any funding over and above the target?
If we surpass our funding goal we will take your suggestions into account when we decide our next steps! We will create a survey on the basis of the feasible suggestions you leave us and address all contributors. Should we translate the e-Book and e-Tool of Thumb into Spanish, French, Italian or Greek? Do you have any other suggestions? Leave us your ideas and comments below!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>California state parks are going to close unless we do

<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Funding for state parks has been diminishing for years. In
January 2011 it got even worse when California Governor Jerry Brown unveiled
his state budget, which included significant cuts to state parks. After all
those years of underfunding, this budget cut was a final blow for state parks.  The state determined it could no longer afford
to keep all of the parks open. So in May 2011, it was announced that 70 state
parks will be permanently closed by July 2012. (<a href=""http://mag70.calparks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">See photos of the 70 threatened parks here.</a>) <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thatâ€™s 25% of Californiaâ€™s state parks that will be closed
to the public!  This is the first time in the 100 year history of
California state parks that a serious, deliberate effort has been made to
significantly reduce the state parks system. Anyone who has visited a state
park, lives in California, or simply loves the outdoors is impacted by this.
But we canâ€™t just sit by and let this happen, we need to do something â€¦
together. <br/></p>

<h2>The Quick Summary</h2>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>South Africa is facing a water crises. To make matters worse, a leaking toilet can waste up to 80 000 gallons of water a year.</p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>We have created a technology we call the Leak-Less Valve that can save 132 gallons of water a day, in one toilet. It is patented, we have 5 Letters Of Interest from ideal customers: 3 from South African government agencies, 2 from USA based construction companies and requests from numerous individuals for the technology.</p>
<h3>You Can Make Every Drop Count</h3>
<p>We want to mass produce this technology to save as much water as possible. Your contribution will help take our prototype and develop a market ready product to save as much water as possible. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When South Africa was facing a critical energy supply crises in 2009, the government purchased solar water heaters for 1 million of the 2.4 million Low Cost Houses they built, in order to mitigate the demand. Water is a prerequisite to generating energy in South Africa and the government has indicated interest to purchase our product as done with the Solar Water Heater project. Therefore, if they do we could save approximately 1 000 000 x 132 gallons of water a day (= 132 000 000) x 365 days a year... Not to mention all the other homes with leaking toilets in the world. We can also create more than 300 jobs at the installation phase alone. </p>
<p>We managed to raise $10 000 through the Unreasonable Institute Market place, which was our first crowd funding experience. We have numerous awards and accolades for our product.
