<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As we stated earlier we want to not only publish our own titles but give creators the means to get their work published and give them a chance they might not otherwise have ever gotten.</p>
<p>Our names are Winston Jordan and Michael Armstrong. We both reside in Memphis, TN.</p>
<p>We are both creative minds who have worked on the comic entitled Dragon Trio for months. </p>
<p>When our relationship with our previous publisher ended we decided to start Inkpot Comix. So many creators are in a similar boat and under the first of a publisher as far as creative control, release schedules and even rightfully due royalties! We want to be the company that changes this injustice!</p>
<p>  We plan on not only publishing our own titles, but giving so much hidden talent the ability to do the same, always retaining complete creative control and reaping 70% of their profit. A much more lucrative deal than the scraps most other companies leave creators for their hard work. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need an excess of at least 500.00 to get things really going. We do not intend for crowdfunding to support our entire venture just enough to really get it moving.

<p> </p>
<p>Those who pledge will be entitled to a number of perks. </p>
<p>If you yourself own a business or offer a service, you can earn a permanent ad (designed by Winston Jordan)for said business or service in one of, two of or even all of our titles depending on the amount of your pledge. Even for smaller pledges we plan to offer copies of our titles autographed by Winston Jordan and Michael Armstrong personally made out to the contributor expressing heartfelt thanks, even mentions of appreciation in the indicia of our comics.</p>

<p>The Beat Up Your Dad Comedy Tour consists
of five stand-up comedians--Connor King, Stephanie Grammar, France Armstrong, William Montgomery, and Lila Bear--who have made a splash in the emerging Memphis, Tennessee and Oxford, Mississippi comedy scenes. After working together in open mics and other
shows, we have decided put our skills and chemistry to the test in the form of
a state-wide tour of MS with a few stops in Tennessee (Memphis), Alabama
(Mobile), and Louisiana (New Orleans). The tour will last about 10 days,
starting in Oxford at Proud Larry’s and ending in Oxford at the Beat Up Your
Dad Comedy Cookout—an outdoor party featuring region-wide comics and local
bands. Mississippi is starting to develop a taste for the entertainment
industry, with more and more films being shot in the state. We feel that with
this tour, Mississippi will have an opportunity to see the how well comedy
plays into the exciting opportunities for entertainment in the state. We all
have a passion to work in the field of comedy, and we think that this tour will
help get the South’s name on the map in a way that could not be done without
it.</p>

<p><b>Hello, My name is...</b></p>
<p>Hi, I'm <b>Sandy</b>. I write and draw books that provide inspiration and encouragement and teach people how to be creatively confident. </p>
<p>I have been an illustrator my entire life. I drew on walls as a kid, did cartoons for a local newspaper as a teen, and started sending out my children's book manuscripts when I was 15. </p>
<p>I also wanted to be an Egyptologist (like Indiana Jones). I went to Brown University for the archaeology, then transferred to the School of Visual Arts in NYC, then back to Providence for Rhode Island School of Design, where I got my BFA in Illustration, in 1992. Next stop (25 years later!) is the Center for Cartoon Studies for my Masters.</p>
<p>The other half of the ""team"" is - <b>Lilah Amaret</b> - my 9 year old daughter, art director, collaborator and character designer. She is the creator of the world famous ""Lilah Beans""- our lovable, but sneaky minions who find their way into everything, especially artwork, and the cookie jar.<br/></p>
<p><b>What was I thinking!?</b></p>
<p>It's NOT a mid-life crisis... maybe more of a teenage rebellion (30 years late)... but I am going back to school to get my Masters in Applied Cartooning. This is a very tough program and I am both terrified and out-of-my-mind excited! I've survived the First Year, also known as ""Boot Camp"" and I am about to embark on my Senior Year... ""Year Two"".</p>

<p><b>Why do this?</b></p>
<p>• I love writing and illustrating! Especially childrens' books, creativity books and drawing books. I've written and illustrated eight books so far and been a part of many others.</p>
<p>• I've been blogging since 2008. Some of my other blogs are: <a href=""http://www.beezinthebelfry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Beez In The Belfry</a>, and <a href=""http://www.ztforkidz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zentangle for Kidz</a>!</p>
<p>• Crossing boundaries between art forms - i.e.: graphic design and Zentangle and illustration and comic books - gets me SO excited. And I'm constantly looking for new things to learn. And then mash-up.</p>
<p>• I'd like to create more books and self-publish them. The first step is to learn the skills that I feel I am missing - to learn the things I don't know that I don't know! Back to school!</p>
<p>• The First Year was really tough - a ""boot camp."" But I survived. I learned drawing and writing techniques, computer, production, and marketing skills - and I shared them all with my Kickstarter supporters! Year Two will be a new challenge - with Professional Practices and planning out my Thesis Project.</p>
<p>• I need the accountability of you, my blog readers, to get out of bed in the morning and go to class. Seriously - knowing I can share all this amazing knowledge with you all at the end of the day IS my reason for doing what I do.</p>

What was I thinking!?
It's NOT a mid-life crisis... maybe more of a teenage rebellion (30 years late)... but I am going back to school to get my Masters in Applied Cartooning. This is a very tough program and I am both terrified and out-of-my-mind excited! I've survived the First Year, also known as ""Boot Camp"" and I am about to embark on my Senior Year... ""Year Two"".
So what's my project?

A blog-documentary-zine-class-comic-adventure...thing... 
Blogumentary? Comicventure?

He has no reflection, only comes out at night, and never leaves the Centro city limits.With the help of a cocky comic store clerk named Adam and a teenaged amnesiac named Annie, Club unravels the bizarre truth about who—and what—Blue is.That truth challenges everything Club believes—and puts a lot of innocent people in harm’s way.The solution to the mystery is only the beginning of the adventure.
THE FORMAT
 I love graphic novels, but I've always wanted more text, and didn't want that text covering up the beautiful artwork. In the format I developed, the top half of each page is text in two columns. The bottom half is made up of comic book panels with no speech bubbles.The text focuses on the detective’s journey. The images build the world and give you the clues to the mystery.The text is in strict first-person point of view; you read only what Chris Club knows, thinks, and learns. The images are in omniscient point of view; you see things Club may or may not ever know.Whenever I read a graphic novel, I find myself speeding through the speech bubbles and barely paying attention to the artwork. I just wanna know what happens next and I miss visual details.The point of this format is to slow the reader down. This isn't meant to be rushed through and tossed aside. It's a fascinating universe that you can immerse yourself in. The longer you stay, the more fun you'll have.When you're done reading the text on a page, you're meant to stop and closely examine each image.In the third image of the first page I showed you above, the one with Blue's green boots dominating the frame, you can see an onlooker giving Blue the finger. It's a tiny detail that shows you that not everyone thinks Blue is good.(The middle finger was the illustrator's idea. I just told him that some people in the crowd are cheering and others are sneering. When I saw how he depicted that, I cracked up.)That's not a huge detail, but if you don't pay close attention to the images, you'll miss important plot points, particularly in the second novel, where the images mostly follow the antagonist while the text focuses on Club.When you're finished reading Issue 1, go back and read it again and you'll see things you missed the first time. And when you're done reading the whole series, go back and read it all again and you'll find some clue hidden on nearly every page.  I designed it to reward multiple readings.You can read the first two chapters for FREE here. THE MYSTERIES This is a twisty-turny story that keeps you guessing. There isn't just one mystery here, there are a series of related mysteries that slowly unfold over time. Every time you think you have it all figured out, a new development will pull the rug out from under you.If you love shows like Black Mirror, The Twilight Zone, Sherlock, Doctor Who, Rick and Morty, LOST, and True Detective, this series will make you very happy. The puzzles in this story lend themselves to pleasurable obsession.  THE TEAM DAVE TERRUSOWRITERThis is me. I'm a novelist and stand-up comic based in Philadelphia. My first novel Cube Sleuth is available on Amazon.As a stand-up, I've opened for acts including Gilbert Gottfried, Richard Lewis, Maria Bamford, and Colin Quinn. I was featured on the RISK! podcast episode 350 Out of Bounds. I co-founded Philly Sketchfest, an international sketch comedy festival now in its 11th year. NICK DESTEFANOILLUSTRATORNick DeStefano is an illustrator and storyboard artist currently based in Los Angeles.  With nearly a decade of experience in the entertainment industry, his work ranges from comics to music videos to TV & film. Nick’s client list includes Disney, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, NBCUniversal, Snap Inc., and others. ERIC BATTLECOVER ARTISTEric Battle’s client list includes Legendary Motion Pictures & Comic Books, Marvel Comics, DC Entertainment, Dynamite Entertainment, Valiant Entertainment, and Dark Horse.Eric has illustrated many stories of popular icons, from Spider-Man, The X-Men, to Young Justice, the teen superhero group from the Cartoon Network animated series.His project with George R.R. Martin, Wild Cards, is being developed as a feature film by Universal/SyFy Films. THE BUDGET It cost me roughly $19,000 to produce the first issue of this series:75 pages of illustrations = $13,500Cover art drawn, colored, and designed = $800ISBNs for the series: $575Printing 1,000 copies = $4,000And that is with my illustrator and cover artist taking pay cuts because they know I’m not able to afford the full price of their inspired creations. They are amazing partners in this.I took a loan against my 401k and used my tax return and all the money I made as a stand up comic and freelance proofreader to finance Issue 1. The point of this campaign is to help finance Issue 2 without me ending up in debtor’s prison.Is debtor’s prison still a thing?How about indentured servitude?I don’t want to do either. THE PERKS My perks are based on what I would want as a reader: a look behind the curtain.The E-book version of Issue 1 includes 16 extra pages of notes and early drafts, the evolution of Blue's suit, and the evolution of the cover art from my terrible sketch to the masterpiece it became. Issue 2 will have a similar amount of extras.I recorded an audiobook too. In the audiobook, I read the panel descriptions that I wrote for Nick to draw (minus anything spoiler-y). So listening to the audiobook makes clear some things about the images that aren’t spelled out explicitly in the text. You listen to the descriptions and go, “Oh, okay, that WAS Club as a baby. I thought so.”I'm also offering a 15-minute spoiler-free AMA (Ask Me Anything...about the book) and a document called 16 Secrets from the Alter Ego Universe.  SHIPPING This campaign will ship to the US, Canada, and the UK only.For the $8, $12, and $20 tiers, there's no shipping required, it's all digital. So that's the way to go if you're outside the US/Canada/UK. You'll get a DropBox link to download your files.For the $25 and $40 tiers, SHIPPING IS INCLUDED FOR THE UNITED STATES ONLY. Sorry, Canadian and UKian friends, I love you dearly, but if I included shipping I'd end up losing money on the transaction. For the $60 and $150 tiers, SHIPPING IS INCLUDED FOR THE US, CANADA, AND THE UK. THE DELIVERY TIMELINE  Issue 1 is complete. I sent it to the printer on September 12. The paperbacks will arrive on Friday, September 26th, a couple weeks before the campaign ends. I'll upload visual proof as soon as I have it.Physical copies, E-books, and audiobooks for Issue 1 only will ship within 30 days of the completion of this campaign. I'm shipping Media Mail, which can take up to 9 days to get to you.Issue 2 will take about 9 months to illustrate and a month to print. I intend to ship Issue 2 in August of 2020.  Okay, that's everything.Wow, I can't believe you read all this. I figured you'd just watch the 2-and-a-half-minute campaign video and have made your decision by the end of it. You're so thorough. You're just the kind of person I want reading my series.You might even figure out the solution to the mystery of Issue 1 before you get to the end, which would make you pretty cool.Thank you so much for your time.Welp, bye for now,Dave",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

There
is a Kingdom beyond space and time, it's called the Empyrean.</p>
<p>
The
Empyrean is a Kingdom where only some have the right to enter after
death, where all those people who were too eccentric in life or had
something more than the others are sent. The Empyrean is also a place
where Gods and faiths are created by the Hyperuranian's council, the
elder philosophers' conscience that rules the balance of this
dimension.</p>
<p>
The
rulers of this dimension are many and, like in their past lives, they
have been conquering and reigning in the Empyrean, creating their
Kingdoms, constantly in conflict with each other. 
</p>
<p>
Those
Kingdoms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	The
	Americas, where dead cowboys and the Maya are constantly in conflict</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	The
	Russian Kingdom, ruled by Ivan the Terrible 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	The
	Asians are ruled by the last Chinese Emperor who's been driven mad
	by his past sins. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	The
	Greeks protect the passage through the Empyrean and the
	Hyperuranian. King Leonidas and his army guard it well 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	The
	Europeans are ruled by a crazy Caesar, of course.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>
Through
the Dust of the Empyrean starts when the Christian God dies. The
philosophers send Don Quixote to gather all the Empyrean's rulers, as
only they can define a new God or religion.</p>
<p>
By
rule of the Empyrean, the dead Christian God and his followers are
exiled to a sort of Limbo. But not all his followers submit to this
rule: people such as Torquemada, Joan of Arc, and others decide to
rebel against the Empyrean and the philosophers in a quest to see
their dead God on his throne again.</p>
<p>
This
mad move forces the Empyrean's rulers, constantly at war with each
other, to work together to quash this open rebellion; and Don Quixote
finds himself involved in a war with the hope of finding a new God
for his people.</p>

group of former students at Scuola Internazionale di Comics decided
to gather together in order to give birth to an independent,
original, new comics reality. Pushed by the desire to make and
publish amazing work, the group soon expanded to involve other young

<p>
Among

SKINWALKER was candidate for one of the three best independent series

<b>What is <i>Frey - A
Romantic Comic Collection</i>?</b>
<p>Frey is an
indie comic book project. It is an anthology that includes stories made by nine
talented Scandinavian comic artists/writers with focus on men's love stories.
<b>That means that all of the main characters in Frey define themselves as men and
every story is written from men’s point of view with the theme of love between men.</b></p>
<p>While all of
the stories focus on love and romance, some of the artists chose to go even
further, depicting the erotic nature of loving relationships.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>Freya – Sequential Love Stories</i>, whose
participants were exclusively people identifying within the female spectrum;
the participants in <i>Frey – A Romantic Comic
Collection</i> are not exclusively men. We, the editors, are sort of female and
therefore feel that for us to make an anthology completely from a man’s point
of view would not be possible or feel right for us to do. We would be extremely
excited and glad if someone somewhere started an anthology (or several)
completely made by men from men’s point of view. Sadly, that cannot be us.
However, all of the comics in this anthology are either; drawn and written by,
written by or has received feedback on its content by someone who identifies
within the male spectrum. <br/></p>

<b>Can we do this? Yes, we can!</b>
<p>Last year
we successfully produced, crowdfunded and printed the anthology <i>Freya – Sequential Love Stories</i>. For the
anthology this crowdfunding is for, <i>Frey
– A Romantic Comic Collection</i>, we will be going about things the same way.</p>
<p>All of us
editors have either participated in or been editors for anthologies like this
before and have produced many marvelous and appreciated self-published comic
books and anthologies.</p>
<p>We know how
to deal with printers, creators and how to make this project a reality.</p>
<p>Trust us,
we’ve got this ;)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What happens if we don’t reach our goal?</b></p>
<p>Don’t
worry. If we don’t reach our campaign goal we will still print the books and
everyone who donated will still receive their books and perks!</p>
<p>All of the
donations that we receive from this campaign will go to the printing of the
books, and the rest will come from our own, the artists, pockets.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why is this anthology important?</b></p>
<p>We started
this project because we want to contribute to the positive depiction of love
stories between men within the male spectrum.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Where does the name Frey come from?</b></p>
<p>The name is
tied to our origin, the Nordic countries. In Nordic mythology Frey is the Norse
god of fertility and the brother of Freya, who is also a goddess of fertility
and love. We chose to name this book Frey because he and Freya are siblings,
much like these anthologies we have created. With the Frey anthology having
stories of men’s love stories and the Freya anthology (published 2015) having
stories of women’s love stories. We feel that these are the perfect names for
these two anthology series.</p>

<b>Timeline</b>
<p>The comics
are just about finished. After we have received all of them from the artists, all that is left
is the proofreading and getting the book ready to be sent to the printers.</p>
<p>All of us,
editors and comic artists, have been working together since October 2015 by
reading each other’s layout sketches and giving each other feedback to ensure
some really interesting and varied comics for you to read.</p>
<p>The book
will be officially released at Stockholms International Comicsfestival in May
2016.</p>
<p>We expect
to be able to start shipping out your books and perks in April-May! Yay!</p>

</div></div>","Hello!


We are three
comic creators, Anette, Elise and Diana, and we are the editors of the Freya & Frey anthologies!
Last year
we held a very successful crowdfunding for our first anthology called Freya – Sequential Love Stories, which had the theme of female love stories.
Now we are back to follow up last year’s
success with the first volume of Frey-
A Romantic Comic Collection, an anthology about men’s love stories.

What is Frey - A
Romantic Comic Collection?
Frey is an
indie comic book project. It is an anthology that includes stories made by nine
talented Scandinavian comic artists/writers with focus on men's love stories.
That means that all of the main characters in Frey define themselves as men and
every story is written from men’s point of view with the theme of love between men.
While all of
the stories focus on love and romance, some of the artists chose to go even
further, depicting the erotic nature of loving relationships.
Unlike Freya – Sequential Love Stories, whose
participants were exclusively people identifying within the female spectrum;
the participants in Frey – A Romantic Comic
Collection are not exclusively men. We, the editors, are sort of female and
therefore feel that for us to make an anthology completely from a man’s point
of view would not be possible or feel right for us to do. We would be extremely
excited and glad if someone somewhere started an anthology (or several)
completely made by men from men’s point of view. Sadly, that cannot be us.
However, all of the comics in this anthology are either; drawn and written by,
written by or has received feedback on its content by someone who identifies
within the male spectrum. 


So, what is this exciting campaign about?
This is
what we need your help with.


We
are hoping to raise 1500€ to help us pay some of the printing costs of the book,
(this will also cover the shipping costs for the gifts we would like to send
you as a thank you for your donations).


Since
this is an indie project, that means that we have no outside funding to print
these books, other than the gathered help of the participating artists.


If
you choose to donate, for example, 15€ (about 16$) we will give you a physical copy of the book and a bookmark as a
thank you.


Shipping: NOTE that 5€ will be added to your donation for worldwide shipping. For delivery within Sweden, shipping is included in the donation for your chosen perk!


Every
little bit helps, even if you’re only able to donate 1€, we will be really
grateful for your support. We also have other perks and gifts for you who
choose to donate a bit more, be sure to check them out.


Remember, if you live outside of Sweden, this might be your only chance to get a hold of this gorgeous anthology! We only plan to print a few hundred of them (with no reprints) so if you want it, now is your chance!We want to reach as many people around the world as we possibly can with our comics. This campaign is a big part in reaching this goal.

The comics of Frey – Romantic Comic CollectionDiana Davidsson & Johan Gustafsson, Firestones.In a distant past, a young king attempts to gain the friendship of a defeated foe, the shaman of an island rich with amber. But will his royal duties thwart his efforts?

Emanu, Oh Danny
Boy.A short comic inspired by the song with the same name. A beautiful depiction of a tragic love story.


Luddvig Melin, Subscribed
to You.Meeting your favorite YouTuber is one thing.Meeting your favorite YouTuber that you also happen to have a seriously huge crush on is quite another! However, first meetings don't always go as well as you'd wish, especially not when nerves and worries get in your way.
BBMN, Kings
of Paver’s Street.Mobsters, maids and conspiracies!Lorem, the young leader of the maffia, has to fight off a rebellion together with his very special maid, Vertige.



Nathalie Nilsson,
Pearls.Necessity has forced a tactical marriage to take place. The groom, however, has no interest at all in his far too young bride and instead choses to spend the wedding night with his trusty bodyguard, Fyren.
Viktor Engholm, Magik & Rockwall.A superhero love story. Losing the one you love is painful. Having them come back from the dead can really play tricks on your mind. How will Rockwall react when his love, Magik, returns from the dead?


Anette Bengtsson,
Down to Zero.Mikael contemplates why finding the love of his 
life, Hannes, doesn't count as being successful in life. Why is it worth
 more, in society's eyes, to have a fancy job than to have found someone
 to share your life with?A slice-of-live about doubting your own power to achieve happiness in life.



Elise Rosberg, C33.
In the late 1800's, two poets were in love. In these unforgiving times, 
they became accused of sodomy, and letting such an accusation go 
unadressed would be the same as saying that it's true. Will this end 
well?




Can we do this? Yes, we can!
Last year
we successfully produced, crowdfunded and printed the anthology Freya – Sequential Love Stories. For the
anthology this crowdfunding is for, Frey
– A Romantic Comic Collection, we will be going about things the same way.
All of us
editors have either participated in or been editors for anthologies like this
before and have produced many marvelous and appreciated self-published comic
books and anthologies.
We know how
to deal with printers, creators and how to make this project a reality.
Trust us,
we’ve got this ;)

What happens if we don’t reach our goal?
Don’t
worry. If we don’t reach our campaign goal we will still print the books and
everyone who donated will still receive their books and perks!
All of the
donations that we receive from this campaign will go to the printing of the
books, and the rest will come from our own, the artists, pockets.

Why is this anthology important?
We started
this project because we want to contribute to the positive depiction of love
stories between men within the male spectrum.

Where does the name Frey come from?
The name is
tied to our origin, the Nordic countries. In Nordic mythology Frey is the Norse
god of fertility and the brother of Freya, who is also a goddess of fertility
and love. We chose to name this book Frey because he and Freya are siblings,
much like these anthologies we have created. With the Frey anthology having
stories of men’s love stories and the Freya anthology (published 2015) having
stories of women’s love stories. We feel that these are the perfect names for
these two anthology series.


Timeline
The comics
are just about finished. After we have received all of them from the artists, all that is left
is the proofreading and getting the book ready to be sent to the printers.
All of us,
editors and comic artists, have been working together since October 2015 by
reading each other’s layout sketches and giving each other feedback to ensure
some really interesting and varied comics for you to read.
The book
will be officially released at Stockholms International Comicsfestival in May
2016.
We expect
to be able to start shipping out your books and perks in April-May! Yay!

<h3>About Me...</h3>
<p>After serving in the Navy for 6 years, it was time to move on to the next stage of my life. Taking a little time to draw everyday on an aircraft carrier at sea, I managed to improve rapidly and went on to study comics and illustration at The Kubert School of Cartooning. My training so far has allowed me to achieve a level of quality in my artwork which is self-explanatory in the images to follow.  In addition to my training, I was Editor-in-Chief of the 22nd Annual West Wind Review Literary Journal at Southern Oregon University, which required me to bring a book from concept to printed product in a short amount of time,  I also worked as a contract software support Tech for Adobe Systems from 2007-2009, specializing in Adobe Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere Pro.  </p>
<h2>What I need to deliver this book to you...</h2>
<p>My unorthodox job experience has given me the perfect combination of both technical and artistic skill-sets that allow me to bring Beatdown Girl from conception to completion. This book is a labor of love, which is why the goal for this campaign is relatively modest.  </p>

But a road there most certainly still is. I and my fellow travellers (some of them equally armed with pencils and paints) hope you will stay with us on the journey. Your support for this book, our blogs, columns and cartoons sustains us on the way. Many thanks.",0.0,0,"11 Campaigns

They've got a few drinks in their bellies, the local garrison and a gang of criminals at their backs, and not much of a plan in front of 'em.This is the second crowdfunding campaign for this serial story, and introduces the third chapter. The book is completely finished and ready to print,  and folks who have read it have had great things to say. We're thrilled and excited to continue to bring this story to life with your help and support!  Some folks would describe this story as that of a man afraid to let go of the past as he deals with shame and regret, while unknowingly searching for a purpose. Others (including me) would just describe it as a not-so-serious jaunt around a familiar yet unique space setting, cut with halfway-decent humor and a big splash of action and adventure.The Ignis Quadrant world and characters draw from a plethora of influencing sources - from science fiction classics like Star Wars® and Firefly, to spaghetti westerns of yesteryear, and even pulp staples like Back to the Future and Indiana Jones. You'll feel right at home in the Ignis Quadrant - comfortable and familiar - while also finding yourself exploring something entirely new and exciting!Chapter #0 is a free prequel issue that you can read digitally RIGHT NOW if you wanna get a bit 'o the origin story, see more of the artwork, and see the writing style.

Individuality and privacy are rare commodities that only the governing elite are privileged to.Imagine, if you will, social media becoming the governing body of a surviving nation. Everything about you, what you do and what you say from the day you were born, is automatically streamed onto your timeline. This is then monitored by a authoritarian regime know as Mainframe.Comic Specification:Size: US Standard 6.69"" x 10.24"" (170mm x 260mm)Number of Pages: 28 pages of story... A total of 32 pages incl. cover.Printed on silk paper 170gsm/63lb (cover) and 130gsm/48lb (internal)What is Mainframe?Mainframe’s main directive is to compete for technological advancement and for survival in a post-apocalyptic world. In the spirit of fighting cyber and bio-terrorism, people of the Ardent Nation are kept on a short leash through the use of a surveillance implants fixed to the side of their heads. The message is simple: comply with Mainframe’s standard behaviour protocol or be rehabilitated… It’s basically all about working as a collective for a common cause, whilst suppressing any scope for individual thought or expression.Who is EYVA?Eyva Danell is very attached to her way of thinking and therefore, is pretty much a thorn in Mainframe’s side. She is a highly-strung bioengineer, who as we follow her journey of self-discovery, we learn of her past, living with the Reformists and her present agenda that could inadvertently lead to the ultimate betrayal.Who are the Reformists?The Reformists are a rebellion group in the eyes of the Ardents. Their ideology rejects invasive technology to protect the human spirit and embrace individuality. Ironically, they use an interdimensional portal to keep themselves tucked away from the clutches of Mainframe.About the Comic:Eyva started out as a television screenplay to explore conflict between differing ideologies. Due to my background in fashion, it became apparent that this story lent itself naturally to a comic series. After seeing Timothy Green II’s epic, illustrative work, I got into contact with him in the U.S. and we set off on a collaborative, cyber journey. The comic is now complete and ready for publication. It’s a labour of love and an extraordinary journey… One of which, we hope our readers will join us on.With the support of our pledgees, EYVA Comic Issue 1: Mainframe is Watching will be the inaugural issue of what will be a provocative and thought provoking sci-fi comic series.About the writer, ANNAS ESKANDER:Annas Eskander is a writer with a passion for sci-fi and fantasy fiction. With a career stretching 15 years in fashion design, EYVA evolved from a TV pilot screenplay to a stylised, cyberpunk comic.About the Illustrator - TIMOTHY GREEN IITimothy Green II is an American comic book artist who has worked in the industry for 15 years with Marvel, DC Comics and Dark Horse. He is known for his work on such titles as Star-Lord, Aeon Flux, Red Hood and Rocket Racoon & Groot.About the Videographer - THE FILM BOYSThe Film Boys come from creative backgrounds and have spent the last 20yrs plus telling stories for brands, companies and products through design, branding and marketing. The focus is now on film because there is currently no better way to tell stories or convey emotive messages than through the medium of video.https://www.thefilmboys.co.uk",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

THE STORY SO FAR
 

      Oi! Tales of Bardic Fury is a historical fantasy comic set in Iron Age Ireland that tells the story of Bryan the bard. Before graduating from the great Bardic College in Tara, Bryan must complete a one year work placement in a tiny coastal village in the north called Oi. When he arrives, he is shocked to learn the village never heard music before. After a rocky start in his first show, Bryan eventually finds his footing in town as a performer and befriends the mysterious and chaotic townspeople including the mushroom head town druid Star Seal.  Bryan even starts a band with Servius the Roman slave, Aideen the hurling captain and her little sister Rhiannon the selkie. As music and songs began to spread through Oi, the villagers became happier and more prosperous.        In the story's first chapter, after accidentally summoning a pod of warrior orcas and leading a revolt against the oppressive tax collectors of Tara, Bryan became a legend in the village. Oi! SOLSTICE shows the victories of Oi – But warns that trouble is coming when Tara decides it is not going to let Oi escape their grasp any longer.      Oi! BANSHEE VALE CALLING tells the story of a high-stakes hurling match between two rival villages that goes too far. Bryan the bard and Oi's hurling captain Aideen have to deal with Dana Bas and the New Way, Banshee Vale's animal sacrificing anarchic crew of  bards. With rations running low, Oi needs food to survive the winter, and the winner of the match gets a stockpile of dried food. Will Dana and Aideen's grudge match go too far? Meanwhile, the high druids of Tara begin clamping down around Oi. Will the power of Music and Bardic Fury be enough to save the day?
Oi! 3: BANSHEE VALE CALLING is the sequel to Oi! SOLSTICE.  The book will be printed with black and white manga-style interior pages and include 48 pages of story, with  bonus concept art and a fan art galleries in the back. Art, story, lettering and book design by me, Daniel de Sosa.
 

You can catch up with the story of Oi! so far on webtoons.

<p><strong>On board the Caravan we have: </strong>Pat Grant, Ben Hutchings, Andrew Fulton, Mandy Ord, Douglas Holgate, Sarah Howell, David Blumenstein, Matt Taylor, Gregory Mackay, Michael Hawkins, Jen Breach &amp; podcaster and comics roadie John Retallick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The adventure is clear - promoting our work and our industry in a much more established part of the world - a part of the world<em> very far away</em> from where we are right now, and one <em>frustratingly expensive</em> to get to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal, $4000, will cover one Caravaner's flights and accommodation on this trip. We hope to do the Caravan again with more and different cartoonists in future years, and if we can prove we can get enough community support to turn a cartoonist into an international ambassador, we reckon we can prove our case and get some more ""formal"" funding next time around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So we're hoping some of you out there can help us out a little. And we can help you out. With comics. You like comics, right? <em>Of course you do</em>. And we've got some good ones. Get yourself some original art, sign up for us to send you some drawn-all-over postcards, get some comics up in your guts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if you don't want any of that nonsense, a couple bucks chucked our way will probably make you feel pretty good for a little bit, knowing that you're helping us not get eaten by mooses, or hamburger dragons, or whatever it is they have over there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Right?</p></div>","In April-May of this year, eleven Australian comic creators; variously award-winning, locally-adored and internationally-published; are touring the North-Eastern United States and Toronto, Canada. This might well be the furthest a group of cartoonists has ever travelled to sell books, give lectures, panels and workshops and to promote Australian comics.
 
We’re calling it the Caravan of Comics.
 
On arrival we'll have one day to recover from jet-lag and then for three weeks we'll do a comic event or we are on the road driving to one everyday.

<p><b><i>Frontier Graveyard: The Risen</i></b>
 is the first graphic novel in a new horror\western series.  The series’
 formula is a cross between X-files and John Wayne, though this volume 
is more Night of the Living Dead meets Clint Eastwood meets 
Frankenstein.  <i>The Risen</i> focuses on zombies terrorizing the 
frontier.  In future stories we will expand the universe to include

I mean create!<br/><br/>I still remember me as a child spending the hours enjoying playing with my favourite toys: Plasticine, the sketch books and pencils!... In resume everything that allowed me to develop my imagination &amp; creativity!Years have passed Till now and I still feel that my greatest passion and sense of life is creation. <br/><p>

<p>Soy Javier Ezarde, un joven artista e ilustrador Español que necesita destruir!!! Digo... Crear!</p>

<h3>""Let comics come to me! (or viceverse)</h3>

Well, for that reason I want to launch my own comic!<br/><br/>As a good son of 80´s I grew up on a magic environment of cartoons, superheroes, toys.... All of that fed up my imagination and life as the perfect flame to enjoying and learning walking through a lot of amazing stories. (Ok, eventhough they were fiction we can also learn from them, couldn´t we?).<br/><br/>Today it´s me the one who want to entertain millions of people (young &amp; adults)  coveying the feelings and thoughts I have when i am reading a comic.<br/><br/>I believe that comics are the best way to reach that. Comics are not just story-tellers... Comics have the power to show stories on the most intimate form. (As if you were the only one that could see them trhough a lock) so is easy feel they have their own soul. Perhaps it can sound very mystic, but if you love comics as I like them, I guess you could easy understand me. I could bet that if you have a comic furniture place on your house for sure you have also some collectionism figures, posters, films...<br/><br/>In fact, the Sver chronicles comic, is just a beginning! The top of an iceberg much more deeper that could emerge if you help me...<br/><br/>If you wanna know more, keep reading! 
<br/><br/><h3>""Dejad que los cómics se acercen a mí!!!""</h3>
<h3>  (o viceversa)</h3>
<p>Bueno, es por esto que deseo lanzar mi primer cómic!</p>
<p>Como buen hijo de los 80´s nací en un maravilloso entorno de dibujos animados, superhéroes, juguetes... que siempre alimentaron mi imaginación y mi vida como una chispa con la que poder aprender y entretenerme a través de increíbles historias (vale aunque sean ficticias también se puede aprender de ellas, no?)<br/></p>
<p> Hoy yo también deseo poder entretener a miles de personas (jóvenes y adultos)  transmitiendo emociones y reflexiones como las que yo aprendo y vivo todavía cuando leo un cómic. <br/></p>
<p>Creo que el cómic es el medio más adecuado para lograr esto. Los cómics no sólo nos cuentan historias...nos las muestran de una manera tan íntima (como si uno las estuviese viendo desde un hueco en la puerta) que es fácil sentirlas con alma propia. Puede que suene un poco místico, pero si te gustan los comics como aquí seguro que entenderás de lo que te estoy hablando... apostaría a que si tienes comics en tu biblioteca seguro que también tienes alguna miniatura de coleccionismo, pòsters, películas, etc...<br/></p>
<p>De hecho, el cómic Sver Chronicles, es tan sólo un comienzo! La punta de un icieberg mucho más profundo que puede salir a la luz si me ayudas...</p>
<p>Si quieres saber más... sigue leyendo!</p>

Hi!Here is Javier Ezarde, a young Spanish illustrator artist who needs destroying!!! Ehh.. I mean create!I still remember me as a child spending the hours enjoying playing with my favourite toys: Plasticine, the sketch books and pencils!... In resume everything that allowed me to develop my imagination & creativity!Years have passed Till now and I still feel that my greatest passion and sense of life is creation.

<h3>Grey Seal</h3>
<p>TREVOR has it all - looks, brains, girls and all the toys a man would want.  He even has an exciting career as a Navy Seal.  Life couldn’t be better.  Then he wakes up.</p>
<p>Trevor is confined to a wheelchair, living on a war-vet pension in an apartment above a smelly Chinese produce store.  Trevor drinks to escape his real existence until he’s back asleep, dreaming fragments of his mission.</p>
<p>He dreams of his last covert operation – the heavily guarded mysterious sphere he had to retrieve from a castle in Hong Kong.  Except his Commanding Officer, COLONEL WAGNER<strong></strong>, tells Trevor that he was never in Hong Kong.  In his records it says that insurgents in Kabul shot and wounded him.  But even though Trevor has little or no memory of the past six months, he knows and <em>feels</em> certain details about his last mission.  Including the presence of JACK<strong>,</strong> the Black Masked man who shot him – in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Since his injury Trevor has shut himself off from the world.  He is angry and resentful. MING, a Chinese prostitute and Trevor’s neighbor, becomes his only friend and confidant.  Although he falls in love with her, Trevor resists Ming’s growing affection for him, fearing he has nothing to offer anymore. </p>
<h3>The Book</h3>

TREVOR has it all - looks, brains, girls and all the toys a man would want.  He even has an exciting career as a Navy Seal.  Life couldn’t be better.  Then he wakes up.
Trevor is confined to a wheelchair, living on a war-vet pension in an apartment above a smelly Chinese produce store.  Trevor drinks to escape his real existence until he’s back asleep, dreaming fragments of his mission.
He dreams of his last covert operation – the heavily guarded mysterious sphere he had to retrieve from a castle in Hong Kong.  Except his Commanding Officer, COLONEL WAGNER, tells Trevor that he was never in Hong Kong.  In his records it says that insurgents in Kabul shot and wounded him.  But even though Trevor has little or no memory of the past six months, he knows and feels certain details about his last mission.  Including the presence of JACK, the Black Masked man who shot him – in Hong Kong.
Since his injury Trevor has shut himself off from the world.  He is angry and resentful. MING, a Chinese prostitute and Trevor’s neighbor, becomes his only friend and confidant.  Although he falls in love with her, Trevor resists Ming’s growing affection for him, fearing he has nothing to offer anymore. 
The Book
In each chapter Trevor’s pursuit is to remember his mission and how he was injured.  But most importantly he needs to find the sphere.  It holds the key to what’s happening to him.  The quest however leads him on a journey that offers more questions than answers, while proving to Trevor that he is on the right path. The mysterious TWELVE aids Trevor and Ming often in surprising ways.  To stay alive and one step ahead of Col. Wagner, Trevor must evade Jack.  And of course, in each chapter Trevor and Ming come close to taking their friendship further, but for various internal or external interferences they remain only friends.  Trevor needs to find the sphere, as it is the key to whatever is going on with, and around him.

Psychologists say, ""If  we educate kids about drugs  in the early stages of  their life there is less chance that they might get into this epidemic"".

Isabel la católica es un cómic histórico que recoge los momentos más relevantes en la vida de una de las mujeres más importantes de la historia de España. En la historia de Isabel se suceden intrigas, luchas por el trono, guerra y amor. Todos los ingredientes que forman los grandes relatos.
El cómic se compone de 32 páginas a color, con guión y dibujo de Manuel Díaz y color y maquetación de Ester Salguero. La edición se realizará en formato de 17x24cm y encuadernación en grapa.

<p>My name is Dori Davidson-Revill and I am here to talk about my graphic novel project Gophenwick.  It chronicles the adventures of Zoe, a nine year old clairvoyant prodigy who investigates paranormal mysteries in an alternate reality from our own. Our goal is to create a tale that is unique, fresh, and new; a story that explores myths and folklore that has otherwise been overlooked in the past in favour of shirtless, oiled-up werewolves, and sparkling vampires. I believe this series will have a huge impact upon the paranormal and mythological genres! The series will introduce the audience to Zoe and the supernatural forces to which she comes in contact with!</p>
<p>This story has been a labour of love. Started in 1996 I have been working on it ever since. Experimenting with various formats and tweaking the mythos until I the story right for sharing.</p>
<p>I wish to give our generous supporters more than just the promise that we will use all donated money wisely and efficiently. I want our supporters to feel as involved and excited about Gophenwick as I do! On the sidebar you will find a selection of amazing perks that accompany each donation level. Everything from production art cards to your face in the comic itself! Any donation, no matter how small, would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>If possible, please donate, tell your friends, and help us get the word out about Gophenwick. The more supporters we have standing behind us, the closer we are to our dream and sharing with you the chilling tale of Gophenwick. Thank you to everyone for your interest and your support.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My Name is Russell Nohelty.  I've got one book, Ichabod Jones:  Monster Hunter, that will be published through Viper Comics later this year.  It's a great book but I want to keep moving forward with new comics as well. My next four issue mini-series will be KATRINA HATES DEAD SHIT. (<a href=""http://www.katrinacomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 87); text-decoration: underline;"">http://www.katrinacomic.com/</a>)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>KATRINA HATES DEAD SHIT follows a badass chick who survives the Rapture and now lives in a small town full of demons, Hellspawn and a smattering of dreadful survivors. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p><br/>Things are about as terrible as one would imagine after the Rapture but given the circumstances Katrina is taking not being ""blue-lighted"" pretty well. Even though she's got a terrible job, horrible co-workers, a leeching ex-roommate and a miserable attitude to boot things could always get worse...somehow.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Things become so dreadful for Katrina that she decides to fight back in a most extreme manner, by traveling to hell and forcing the Devil to end the Apocalypse once and for all.  </p>
<p><br/>KATRINA HATES DEAD SHIT is a 4 issue mini-series that gives a tongue in cheek look at how surviving the Apocalypse will suck donkey balls but it's not the end of the world. </p>

<p>Katrina is drawn by the uber talented Juan Frigeri (<a href=""http://spadjm.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://spadjm.deviantart.com/</a>) colored by the amazing Thomas Bacon (<a href=""http://thomasbacon.webs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thomasbacon.webs.com/</a>) and lettered by the fantastic Bernie Lee (<a href=""http://www.comicspace.com/blee/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.comicspace.com/blee/</a>).  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm already in production on the first issue of Katrina, but I frankly need money to keep this project going through the first issue.  I'm currently in production on three books with a fourth to follow.  Because I use only top quality talent and never scrimp on hiring a fantastic artist it's become too costly to keep more than one book in production at any given time.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You can see the fruits of hiring top tier talent by reading the first eleven pages of issue #1 at <a href=""http://www.katrinacomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.katrinacomic.com/</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>That's where you come in.  Without your help more issues of Katrina Hates Dead Shit might never happen and that would be a shame because it's a great story for any fans of Apocalyptic books, horror books, comedy books or any fan of comics young or old (though not too young).  I like to say that it's Left Behind told as a comedy.   </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Take a look at the perks on the side and even if you can help with $1 it would be great.  If you can help more than you'll see some really cool perks including copies of the book all the way up to being drawn as the DEVIL in our final issue!  That's right Katrina travels into Hell to confront the Devil and that could be you!   </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I know this is a pretty ambitious goal, but I'm a pretty ambitious guy and I know with your help we'll get there!  </p>

<p>Mivel a kampány <strong>flexibilis finanszírozású</strong>, mindenkinek, aki itt előrendeli valamelyik csomagot, azt le is fogjuk szállítani, hisz a kampány sikeressége nem függ attól, hogy elérjük-e a kívánt célösszeget. De akkor miért az Indiegogo és miért nem egy sima előrendeléses rendszer?<br/><br/><strong>A képregény</strong> - mint mondtuk - <strong>mindenképpen megjelenik</strong>... egyszer. Azonban nem mindegy, hogy mikor! Minél több előrendelésünk gyűlik össze, annál hamarabb készül el a sorozat első része.  Hogy miért?</p>
<ul>
<li>Krisztián, rajzolónk csak abban az esetben tudja főállásként rajzolni a képregényt, ha sikerül annyi támogatást gyűjtenünk, hogy az egész napos rajzolás mellett jusson neki sok kávéra és talán még tejre és kenyérre is. Magyarán Az Utolsó Előtti Huszár legyen az egyetlen munkája és bevételi forrása az idő alatt, amíg a képregény készül. Ez az első célszámunk.<br/> </li>
<li> Ha összejön a kívánt összeg, abból tudjuk fedezni a nyomdai és egyéb költségeket (+ az indiegogo saját %-át) valamint Krisztián tud majd elég időt fordítani a képregényre, hogy az mihamarabb megjelenhessen immáron a 0. résszel ellentétben színes formában, sok-sok extrával együtt (karakterlapok, poszterek, novella, stb...). <br/> </li>
<li>Amennyiben nem érjük el az első célt, csüggedni akkor sem kell! A beérkező összeget ugyanis elsősorban a nyomdai munkálatokra, kivitelezésre fordítjuk, csak az ezeken felüli összeget fogjuk felhasználni megélhetési célokra. Első a képregény, aztán jövünk mi, alkotók. </li>
</ul>
<p>A rizikót tehát ez esetben leginkább mi magunk vállaljuk, hisz a minimum célösszeget úgy kalkuláltuk, hogy éppen fedezzen minden felmerülő költséget és ne kelljen a családi kasszánkban turkálnunk a maradék költségek fedezése okán. Ezen célösszegen felül már minden beérkezett forint ajándék, amit a képregény alkotás támogatására tudunk fordítani, valamint olyan extrák tető alá hozására, mint a vendégrajzolók által készített extra epizódok vagy a képregény keménykötésű rendezői változata. </p>

Az Utolsó Előtti Huszár egy történelmi ihletésű, misztikus horror-kaland képregény.A kampányunk célja, hogy a befolyt összegből legyártsuk a megrendelt képregényeket, a fennmaradó hasznot pedig arra fordítjuk, hogy rajzolónk Krisztián, csak a képregénnyel foglalkozhasson annak elkészültéig! 


 
Az Utolsó Előtti Huszár történelmi dráma és természetfeletti horror keveréke, melyben a magyar népmesék, legendák és mitológia világa keveredik a Nagy Háború valós eseményeivel.A történet megalkotása során valós eseményeket és személyeket tanulmányoztunk – történész konzulensek segítségével – és klasszikus mondák, népmesék elemeit szőttük bele a saját mesénkbe. Mindez kapott egy modern fantasy hangulatot, egy csipetnyi folklórral és gótikus (néhol kozmikus) horrorral megbolondítva.A képregény első része színesen, 30 oldalon érkezik.A sorozat első ciklusát 6 részesre tervezzük, melyet egy nulladik, bevezető mini-epizód,a ""Füstbe ment terv"" egészít ki. 


...de a színfalak mögött dúl egy másik háború is! A történet egy paranormális ügyekkel foglalkozó titkos huszárszervezettel, a Fekete mentésekkel foglalkozik, köztük is főképp Csillagszeművel, aki egy különleges képességű és különösen forrófejű tagja a tizenkettesek, azaz a ""boszorkányosok"" csapatának.A történet első hat részének folyamán bejárjuk majd a háború sújtotta Európa legsötétebb zugait, köztük több legendás helyszínt is, ahol valós történelmi személyekkel is találkozni fogunk.A történet elsősorban mégis a csapatról szól, arról a hat elit katonáról, akik a tizenkettesek szívét-lelkét és lángoló kardját alkotják és akik feladata, hogy kordában tartsák a folyamatosan jelenlévő természetfeletti fenyegetést!Ismerjétek meg a tizenkettesek elit katonáit: 




Büszkék vagyunk rá, hogy a képregény alkotócsapatához hazánk TOP rajzolói közül többen is csatlakoztak, hogy alkotásaikkal emeljék a kampányunk és a Huszárok világának fényét. Vendék alkotóink műveit nem csak alternatív borító, de akár poszter formájában is megszerezhetitek, valamint azok bekerülnek a ""Rendezői"", a ""Páros csomag"" és a ""Gyűjtői kiadású"" csomagjainkba is (a 80+ oldalas képregény belső mellékleteként). ​Köszönjük a közreműködést az alábbi alkotóinknak!Nóthóf Ferenc, László Márk, Németh Gyula, Felvidéki Miklós, Lakatos István  és Lanczinger Mátyás.FONTOS: Azoknál a csomagoknál, ahol választhatók a borító vagy poszter minták az alkotókat a kezdőbetűikkel jelöltük meg.

Külföldi postázás: Természetesen tudunk külföldre is postázni, ebben az esetben azonban értelemszerűen jóval magasabb lesz a postaköltség. Természetesen minden támogatóval fel fogjuk venni a kapcsolatot és megpróbáljuk a legkényelmesebb és legolcsóbb, legbiztonságosabb megoldást megtalálni. 

Legfontosabb célunk természetesen a képregény első részének minél hamarabbi elkészítése és eljuttatása az előrendelőkhöz. Van azonban pár tervünk arra az esetre is, ha sikerül túllépnünk az elsődleges célunkat.
Az elsődleges célig elért összegből a nyomdai és egyéb költségeken felüli nyereséget arra fordítjuk, hogy Krisztián csak ezzel foglalkozva 4-5 hónapon belül elkészítse az első részt.Ez idő alatt nem vállal más munkát és nem foglalkozik mással, így biztosan a tervezett minőségben, színes formában, kiegészítő elemekkel együtt el tudja készíteni a képregényt, valamint ebből az összegből már jut a nyomdán és egyéb költségeken kívül arra is, hogy megalapozzuk vele az egész sorozatot! (azaz annak első 5 részét)A második célunk László Márk képregénye, azaz egy eredeti Az Utolsó Előtti Huszár mini-történet, melyet Márk rajzol meg és melyben a történet kitalálásában is aktívan részt vállal.
Harmadik célunk Németh Gyula képregénye, azaz egy eredeti Az Utolsó Előtti Huszár mini-történet, melyet Gyula rajzol meg és melyben a történet kitalálásában is aktívan részt vállal.

Negyedik célunk Nóthóf Ferenc képregénye, azaz egy eredeti Az Utolsó Előtti Huszár mini-történet, melyet Feri rajzol meg és melyben a történet kitalálásában is aktívan részt vállal.
Ötödik célunk a kemény borítós rendezői kötetek elkészítése. Ha ez a cél teljesül, minden 80+ oldalas nyomdai kötetünket kemény borítóval készítjük el és adjuk át, illetve postázzuk a rendelőinknek, attól függetlenül, hogy a sima rendezői csomagban vagy a legfullosabb gyűjtői kiadásban lenne-e benne.

Hatodik célunk Csepella Olivér egyedi borító variánsa. Mivel az Indiegogo visszamenőleg nem engedi, hogy belenyúljunk már létező csomagokba, ez a borító variáns külön csomagként lesz elérhető, az eredeti Alternatív kiadással megegyező tartalommal és áron. 
Hetedik célunk egy dedikált Ex Libris, azaz betétlap (A5 méretű, vastag kártya) a Rendezői, a Páros és a Gyűjtői csomagokhoz (visszamenőleg is), azaz minden 80+ oldalas kötet mellé. A lap egy egyedi, CSAK az indiegogo-s rendelőknek elérhető képet jelent, a két alkotó dedikálásával.

 Nyolcadik célunk +4 oldal a képregénybe! Ezzel a kötet hosszabb lesz, a történet pedig kap két extra jelenetet. A bővülés vonatkozik mindegyik csomagra a digitálistól egészen a gyűjtői kiadásig. 

Kilencedik célunk egy profi 3D szobrásszal terveztetett Csillagszemű figura, amit ki is nyomtattatunk 3D-s nyomtatóval, majd egy új (szuper-limitált) csomagban elérhető lesz minden új és már meglévő rendelőnk számára! 

 

Tizedik célunk: Függetlenül attól, hogy milyen csomagot rendeltetek (digitális vagy nyomtatott, sima, extra vagy gyűjtői) +6 oldal jár a képregénybe! 2 oldallal lesz hosszabb a történet, míg a kötet 4 extra oldalt is kap, ami a mentések két tagjának katonai aktáját és bemutató oldalát fogja tartalmazni részletes leírásokkal és képekkel.  

Tizenegyedik cél: Ha elérjük a 15.000 dolláros összeget, mindenkinek (aki kéri) profi makettfestő fogja kézzel kifesteni a figuráját, a nem figurás csomagokat rendelők pedig egyedi, kétoldalas könyvjelzőt kapnak!

Mivel a kampány flexibilis finanszírozású, mindenkinek, aki itt előrendeli valamelyik csomagot, azt le is fogjuk szállítani, hisz a kampány sikeressége nem függ attól, hogy elérjük-e a kívánt célösszeget. De akkor miért az Indiegogo és miért nem egy sima előrendeléses rendszer?A képregény - mint mondtuk - mindenképpen megjelenik... egyszer. Azonban nem mindegy, hogy mikor! Minél több előrendelésünk gyűlik össze, annál hamarabb készül el a sorozat első része.  Hogy miért?

Krisztián, rajzolónk csak abban az esetben tudja főállásként rajzolni a képregényt, ha sikerül annyi támogatást gyűjtenünk, hogy az egész napos rajzolás mellett jusson neki sok kávéra és talán még tejre és kenyérre is. Magyarán Az Utolsó Előtti Huszár legyen az egyetlen munkája és bevételi forrása az idő alatt, amíg a képregény készül. Ez az első célszámunk. 
 Ha összejön a kívánt összeg, abból tudjuk fedezni a nyomdai és egyéb költségeket (+ az indiegogo saját %-át) valamint Krisztián tud majd elég időt fordítani a képregényre, hogy az mihamarabb megjelenhessen immáron a 0. résszel ellentétben színes formában, sok-sok extrával együtt (karakterlapok, poszterek, novella, stb...).  
Amennyiben nem érjük el az első célt, csüggedni akkor sem kell! A beérkező összeget ugyanis elsősorban a nyomdai munkálatokra, kivitelezésre fordítjuk, csak az ezeken felüli összeget fogjuk felhasználni megélhetési célokra. Első a képregény, aztán jövünk mi, alkotók. 

A rizikót tehát ez esetben leginkább mi magunk vállaljuk, hisz a minimum célösszeget úgy kalkuláltuk, hogy éppen fedezzen minden felmerülő költséget és ne kelljen a családi kasszánkban turkálnunk a maradék költségek fedezése okán. Ezen célösszegen felül már minden beérkezett forint ajándék, amit a képregény alkotás támogatására tudunk fordítani, valamint olyan extrák tető alá hozására, mint a vendégrajzolók által készített extra epizódok vagy a képregény keménykötésű rendezői változata.

""Sails of Blood"" is the prequel of another series of dark humor comic books we are working on about a character and comic book called “Nathaniel Demon” (http://longoria7.tripod.com/id12.html). I cannot tell you much about it without spoiling it, but in this story arc, he becomes a Pirate and this is one of his many adventures. It starts in the 1700s, when the Vampire/Pirate Jacob Nathaniel Van Ritter is sailing the Caribbean waters with his Mayan crew, looking for an unknown artifact that will cure him of his thirst for blood. He is also being unknowingly followed by a group of terrible adversaries who have sworn to destroy him. Expect horror, action and adventure!
We were planing to print it in a series of 3 comic books, but we've now decided to publish it as a Trade Paper Back Graphic Novel. We'll print as many copies as we can if we meet our goal, and if we get enough extra funding we will go for a hard cover format. We'll also be printing some limited edition t-shirts with original artwork of a vampire Jolly Roger (see video and pic), plus many other outstanding rewards.we have finished Pencils inks and colors and I'm currently working on the lettering for the first pages of ""Sails of Blood"". With your funding we intend to pay for the lettering for the rest of the book. Any additional funds will go towards printing costs for the 100-page (aprox) trade paperback, and we're planning to have the book ready roughly one month after we start this campaign so you wont have to wait until the end of the campaign's time we will send you the book and other incentives ASAP. You can follow updates, watch videos and samples of the colored pages on Facebook as well at BLOGGER, so please subscribe, here's how:Join into the new ""Sails of Blood"" the Pirate graphic novel group @ Facebook.

<h3>Welcome to Vampire, PA</h3>
<p>Not all that long ago, Dean Marklin was a regular HVAC sales and repairman in his hometown of Dormont, Pennsylvania, a long established suburb in the south hills of Pittsburgh. Then he discovered that his childhood favorite cinema, long abandoned, was home to a clan of vampires. And then, to his surprise, he discovered he was really good at fighting vampires.</p>
<p>Six months later, Dean, his fiancé Dee Dee O'Day, and his day job boss Scuba Dave Donovan, own that old movie theater and have turned the battle against vampire queen Jocelyn into an all-out war. Only now there’s a new challenger to Jocelyn’s power, and that challenger looks an awful lot like <strong>Al Capone</strong>.</p>
<p>And oh, yeah, Dee Dee's been turned into a vampire and she's distinctly not happy about it!</p>
<p>This special ones-shot is 28-pages of story and art with 4 pages of bonus features. Yeah, so there might be an ad on the back cover, so we can’t quite say “no ads,” but it genuinely is one seriously packed comic book. You don’t have to have read the original trade paperback to enjoy this one (it’s great if you have, but it’s okay if you haven’t).</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Other than our thank-you page, the files for the entire comic are complete and ready to print. </strong>No kidding! We're looking for your help to upgrade the printing, particularly our cover treatments, so we can better show off the great art and bump up the perks for our supporters!</li></ul>

Cartoonist from the southwestern part of Germany. I’ve been an establish
 artist for the past 15 years. I’m pleased with my line of work. In fact
 I believe it is my true calling.
I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis a few years ago. Art has helped me manage my disease.
I established my Cartoon figure MOPF back in 2000. My aim was to 
uplift people suffering from chronic disease through what I like to call
 “cartoon therapy”. My artwork was able to bring smiles to people. 
Laughter is the best medicine.
MOPF action plan is to support Mentally ill people and become a voice
 for people in the final stage of their lives. MOPF will raise awareness
 about chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis with a series of 
humoresque and informative cartoons.

<h3>The Story </h3>
<p>When our reality came into existence a river of light was set at the center of all things. It is there every soul in the universe returns when they die, that they might be reincarnated, in a new body, on a new world, over and over again until they are made perfect.<br/> </p>
<p>The guardian of the river of light is Indra,  one of the powerful first Gods. For aeons of time Indra has kept watch over the river. Making sure that both the hero and the villain and everyone in between,  are allowed to return to the waters and be born anew. But when the Ahi, the darkest soul in all of existence returns to the river, Indra finds herself unable to just stand by and watch as it spreads its evil to yet another people, on another world. But in order to intervene she must abandon her duty, and take a stand against both the Gods of Darkness and the Gods of Light, who will not simply allow the great cosmic order to be disrupted. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>LIGHT # 1 is a 40 page full color dark fantasy. Get a copy  before we take a crack at wide distribution early next year.</strong> </p>

<p>The<strong> DOUBLE PACKS</strong> are designed for you to do a little wheelin' and dealin' of your own. Keep one and throw the second one up on ebay to recoup your cost. Chances are, you will at least break even.   Or for the collectors out there, read one and keep the other pristine in the bag!</p>
<p>We have a couple of great packages for you. Our goal is $2000 and all of the money we earn here will go towards recovering the cost of production and printing. (It turns out its really expensive to make a comic book!) </p>
<p>A success with this book will allow us to print enough copies to attend conventions with, which will help us make enough money to create more books and pursue our life long dream of making a living in comics. </p>
<p>We have a bunch of cool projects planned and we hope we will be able to get them into your hands and local comic shops for years to come. </p>

<h3><strong>Who I Am:</strong></h3>
<p>I'm Catie (CE) Murphy, author of many many many books, quite a few short stories, and the occasional graphic novel!</p>
<p>I've loved comics since I was a kid, and keep noodling with scripts but rarely have the money to pay an artist, because...well, I'm an author, that's why. Despite JK Rowling and Stephen King, authors are not actually notorious for making very much money, so this project is to help defray the costs of paying an artist for this little project I want to launch.</p>
<h3><strong>What It Is:</strong></h3>
<p><i>Starshot</i> is a little bit <i>Farscape,</i> a little bit <i>Guardians of the Galaxy,</i> and a little bit ""Yeah, but what if the girls were the main characters?"" It's a little bit of frustration that so many comics these days aren't aimed at kids. It's a little bit of wanting to write some epic swashbuckling space opera adventure. It's a little bit of all of that, and a lot of love for the science fiction genre and the comic book format.</p>
<p>It's also a little bit of ""Dang it, I've had this script sitting around for years and I'm gonna DO SOMETHING with it!"", and now, having found a collaborator who's excited about drawing it, I'm just really looking forward to putting it together and getting it out into the world. This short is very much a <i>chapter one</i> style thing, so this project might--who knows--spawn more, someday!</p>
<h3><strong>What I Need:</strong></h3>
<p>I need $2000 USD (about €1800) to pay the fabulous Katie Longua for 8 fully drawn, colored and lettered digital comic book pages. <strong>GOAL REACHED!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal #1</strong>: I'd LOVE an additional $400/€365 to pay MYSELF for having written the script. Wouldn't that be neat? :) <strong>GOAL REACHED!!!!! OMG!!! I'VE NEVER GOTTEN PAID FOR A COMIC BEFORE!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal #2</strong>: The basic plan here is to do a digital-only release for <i>Starshot</i>. To do a small physical print run, it'll be an additional $750/€680, which will cover both the print costs and shipping assuming up to 300 people want a print comic shipped to them. :)</p>
<p><strong>Total goal, including stretch goals</strong>: $3150/€2845</p>
<h3><strong>HOLY MOLY WE REACHED BOTH THE STRETCH GOALS!!!!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>ADDITIONAL STRETCH GOALS AS FOLLOWS:</strong></h3>
<p>At €3200, there will be COVER ART and COVER ART PRINTS for everyone getting print copies of Starshot!</p>
<p>At €4200, there will be FOUR ADDITIONAL PAGES of story! This is an all or nothing: print means adding 4 pages at a time, so if we only get to €3800, the writer (that's me) will get a more generous page rate, and any excess will be tucked aside to cover unexpected expenses.</p>
<p>In the event of reaching €5200, we'll get a total of EIGHT PAGES of additional story! CAN YOU EVEN IMAGINE?!?!?! EEEEEEEEEK!!!!</p>
<h3><strong>When It'll Be Ready:</strong></h3>

But the one question that can be is; if it got too bad, if you couldn't stand it anymore, would you opt out or wait until nature takes its course? Maybe this show will see you question that answer, maybe it won't! But it will make you laugh. Why? Because comedy and tragedy are the best of friends - oh and I'm a comedian, so that helps!

Probably not, you're a sane, rational human being - but now that we're talking about it, the one place you're gonna find out is right here, with my comic series <i>Ice Cold Killers: The Serious Cases of Detective Rick Frost</i>. This series takes place in a reality where snowmen roam the streets devoid of human life, doing their best to make happy lives for themselves in a 1940's style environment. This happiness is threatened when a mysterious serial killer known only as the Heat Miser starts making lives a living hell for the police force, and the city that just wants to feel safe. To make matters worse the blabbering mouth of the chief of police has made the work even harder by letting the news get a hold on the serial killer's M.O.. Now, among a slew of copy-cat killers trying to slide by the system, it's up to Detective Rick Frost to bring justice back to the streets. </p><ul>
<li>My name is Steven Terrill, and I've been studying writing for almost a decade, with a Bachelors in Creative Writing from Waynesburg University, and working on a Masters in Creative Writing from Southern New Hampshire University. I also have a deep love of psychology and hold a Bachelors in the field from Waynesburg University as well. I currently reside in Waynesburg, working at a local pizza shop to pay the bills, and trying to squeeze in time for my creative endeavors. </li>
<li>I've been a fan of comics for years, but I've never tried writing one before. With this project I hope to not only make a start in the field, but make a mark as well. I love studying the pathology of serial killers, but even more interesting to me are the people who attempt top circumvent the law by matching their crimes to the M.O. of other criminals. That takes a special kind of psychopath, if you ask me, and that's a major part of what I want to explore with this series. Sure, they are all going to be snowmen, but they will be human as well.  </li>
<li>Worried I might not be a good writer? Check out my publications in eFiction, a digital lit magazine. Kimberly Ann and Far From Home were two short stories I published through them, and Kimberly Ann in it's crappy rough draft form won me a Scholastic Gold Key Award for short story in 2008 when I was still in high school. Good luck finding that version of the story though, I may have burned all my copies when I rewrote it in college screaming ""What was I thinking?!"" What this means for you is that not only am I a published writer, I'm also willing to take a critical look at my work. </li>
<li>You are super important to this project. Without you, this series probably won't get made. The amount of time and energy that will going into this project would leave me without the extra time or energy to gather the materials I need to be successful. <b>More importantly you are a crucial part of this project because the more you back me, even just by sending a supporting message my way, the greater the odds are of this being amazing</b>. Little signs of support are the real currency here, the actual funding amount is just a helpful bonus to get the tools to do the job right. </li>
</ul><p>That's about it for me and the general scope of the project, and I want to take the time to thank you for reading even this far. I hope you enjoyed the concept, at the very least, and even if you don't contribute, feel free to message me about questions about the project or suggestions to improve! My goal is for the first five issues to be done by August, but anyone receiving stickers will receive them by the end of June, God willing! </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Are The Funds For?</h3><p>800$ is a lot of cash, and it's your cash, so you deserve to know where it's all going to be going. </p><ul>
<li>
<b>Drawing Equipment</b>: I'm not talking about pens and paper, I'm talking about nice digital drawing equipment. I'm no pro at art, but I know that with the proper tools in my hands I can make something we can all enjoy. Typically the got o brand is Wacom, which I have used in the past, but unless you're willing to spend a buttload of cash on them, you're stuck with a basic drawing pad. What I hope to get instead of their larger drawing monitor, is a Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet model 2014 or newer, which has a comparable drawing stylus to the Wacom models, at a much more affordable price. Most of the funding will go to this, since the cost ranges from 500 to 600 dollars.</li>
<li>
<b>Perks!: </b>I'm going to try and offer as many cool perks as I can think of, but some perks are going to have to match the level of commitment to the project, and that can get a little pricey. What ever is left over from the funds after purchasing the drawing equipment, is going into help paying for the perks. </li>
<li>
<b>Long Term Stretch Goals</b>: I've tried to keep the cost down low on this project, I don't want anyone to chip in and feel jibbed on their contributions. As the project takes off, I'll be trying to keep up with everyone as the funds are raised, and <b>for every 50 dollars raised, I am going to post a sketch from the Pilot issue</b> of the comic, so that even people not getting a PDF of the Pilot will get a chance to see it. Also, any funds raised past the funding amount will go into a side fund for me to try and take time off work to sit down and focus on only the comic to get it done faster, so that you all all can reap the benefits sooner! Basically, over funding is going to fund me taking a sabbatical to work solely on this project, I'll even time it with my school break! </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Your Impact</h3><p>I can't stress enough that each of you reading this an important part of the project to me. </p><ul>
<li>Without you, this project is going to suffer the wears and tears of time as the window of opportunity for me to work on it slowly passes.</li>
<li>With you, we're going to build a strong community for this project, and you're going to be on the forefront of all of it. </li>
<li>Even when this project closes on indiegogo, our journey will continue, and I will keep you all in the loop, as long as you want to be. Plus, I don't know how to make spam messages, so you'll know that every message from me is legit! </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Money is tight all around, believe me I know. If you can't contribute but you like this project, you can still help! </p><ul>
<li>Share this project! A lot! You may not get a perk from it, but you'll make my day a little brighter for it!</li>
<li>Tell your friends! </li>
<li>email me to tell me what you think: <h2>detectiverickfrost@gmail.com</h2>

<li><p>If you do email me, even to tell me you think this project sucks butts, expect a response! </p></li>

Probably not, you're a sane, rational human being - but now that we're talking about it, the one place you're gonna find out is right here, with my comic series Ice Cold Killers: The Serious Cases of Detective Rick Frost. This series takes place in a reality where snowmen roam the streets devoid of human life, doing their best to make happy lives for themselves in a 1940's style environment. This happiness is threatened when a mysterious serial killer known only as the Heat Miser starts making lives a living hell for the police force, and the city that just wants to feel safe. To make matters worse the blabbering mouth of the chief of police has made the work even harder by letting the news get a hold on the serial killer's M.O.. Now, among a slew of copy-cat killers trying to slide by the system, it's up to Detective Rick Frost to bring justice back to the streets. 
My name is Steven Terrill, and I've been studying writing for almost a decade, with a Bachelors in Creative Writing from Waynesburg University, and working on a Masters in Creative Writing from Southern New Hampshire University. I also have a deep love of psychology and hold a Bachelors in the field from Waynesburg University as well. I currently reside in Waynesburg, working at a local pizza shop to pay the bills, and trying to squeeze in time for my creative endeavors. 
I've been a fan of comics for years, but I've never tried writing one before. With this project I hope to not only make a start in the field, but make a mark as well. I love studying the pathology of serial killers, but even more interesting to me are the people who attempt top circumvent the law by matching their crimes to the M.O. of other criminals. That takes a special kind of psychopath, if you ask me, and that's a major part of what I want to explore with this series. Sure, they are all going to be snowmen, but they will be human as well.  
Worried I might not be a good writer? Check out my publications in eFiction, a digital lit magazine. Kimberly Ann and Far From Home were two short stories I published through them, and Kimberly Ann in it's crappy rough draft form won me a Scholastic Gold Key Award for short story in 2008 when I was still in high school. Good luck finding that version of the story though, I may have burned all my copies when I rewrote it in college screaming ""What was I thinking?!"" What this means for you is that not only am I a published writer, I'm also willing to take a critical look at my work. 
You are super important to this project. Without you, this series probably won't get made. The amount of time and energy that will going into this project would leave me without the extra time or energy to gather the materials I need to be successful. More importantly you are a crucial part of this project because the more you back me, even just by sending a supporting message my way, the greater the odds are of this being amazing. Little signs of support are the real currency here, the actual funding amount is just a helpful bonus to get the tools to do the job right. 
That's about it for me and the general scope of the project, and I want to take the time to thank you for reading even this far. I hope you enjoyed the concept, at the very least, and even if you don't contribute, feel free to message me about questions about the project or suggestions to improve! My goal is for the first five issues to be done by August, but anyone receiving stickers will receive them by the end of June, God willing! What Are The Funds For?800$ is a lot of cash, and it's your cash, so you deserve to know where it's all going to be going. 

Drawing Equipment: I'm not talking about pens and paper, I'm talking about nice digital drawing equipment. I'm no pro at art, but I know that with the proper tools in my hands I can make something we can all enjoy. Typically the got o brand is Wacom, which I have used in the past, but unless you're willing to spend a buttload of cash on them, you're stuck with a basic drawing pad. What I hope to get instead of their larger drawing monitor, is a Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet model 2014 or newer, which has a comparable drawing stylus to the Wacom models, at a much more affordable price. Most of the funding will go to this, since the cost ranges from 500 to 600 dollars.

Perks!: I'm going to try and offer as many cool perks as I can think of, but some perks are going to have to match the level of commitment to the project, and that can get a little pricey. What ever is left over from the funds after purchasing the drawing equipment, is going into help paying for the perks. 

Long Term Stretch Goals: I've tried to keep the cost down low on this project, I don't want anyone to chip in and feel jibbed on their contributions. As the project takes off, I'll be trying to keep up with everyone as the funds are raised, and for every 50 dollars raised, I am going to post a sketch from the Pilot issue of the comic, so that even people not getting a PDF of the Pilot will get a chance to see it. Also, any funds raised past the funding amount will go into a side fund for me to try and take time off work to sit down and focus on only the comic to get it done faster, so that you all all can reap the benefits sooner! Basically, over funding is going to fund me taking a sabbatical to work solely on this project, I'll even time it with my school break! 
Your ImpactI can't stress enough that each of you reading this an important part of the project to me. 
Without you, this project is going to suffer the wears and tears of time as the window of opportunity for me to work on it slowly passes.
With you, we're going to build a strong community for this project, and you're going to be on the forefront of all of it. 
Even when this project closes on indiegogo, our journey will continue, and I will keep you all in the loop, as long as you want to be. Plus, I don't know how to make spam messages, so you'll know that every message from me is legit! 
Other Ways You Can HelpMoney is tight all around, believe me I know. If you can't contribute but you like this project, you can still help! 
Share this project! A lot! You may not get a perk from it, but you'll make my day a little brighter for it!
Tell your friends! 
email me to tell me what you think: detectiverickfrost@gmail.com

If you do email me, even to tell me you think this project sucks butts, expect a response!

In
February, the LYRE COMICS launched the FIRST ISSUE of WIELDER, written and created by David Goldberg and illustrated by Arron Malone. You can read issue one here!  Now, with new series artist Ryan Cutter, the Lyre
team is looking to complete the first story arc with FOUR MORE ISSUES: online
and in print, free to read. Based on response and demand, we will determine
whether WIELDER can continue as a series, be profitable, and where it would
belong in 2016 and beyond.character sketches by new series artist Ryan CutterWHY THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENTThis series features women of varying ages, a lead who is exploring his faith, many queer and trans players, and an African American dream princess. This series lacks the damp and dreary ethos of many modern comics.

<p>WHY THIS STORY?</p>
<p> ""As a writer they say ""write what you know"". Now, I love writing high concept sci-fi and fantasy stories that immerse you into a whole new world. But this is so much more than that. This is a story about being a teenager and going after your purpose in life. Sometimes to a fault. This is a story about friendship - but also about owning, caring for and loving a pet. In my mid 20's I finally got a dog of my own, a beagle named Ellie. Taking care of a dog was more work than I ever expected. One day I took her to the park, like I did many mornings, for a game of fetch. That day Ellie was struck by a car. I had to walk back home with her in my arms while I thought her life was drifting away from her little body. She was in rough shape. All I could do was hope that she'd hang in there. Once home, we rushed to the vet so they could care for her. Luckily Ellie survived and made a full recovery. She's 3 now, living her life sprinting through the Southern California beaches. She's already taught me more than I could've expected. This is a story about appreciating what you have, before it's too late. This is a story for Ellie.""</p>

  As a group of independent creators Kickstarter is a chance for us to self publish and produce this comic.  Sure, we'd love to have a publisher with us on the series someday. But right now, this is as raw as it gets. This is a group of friends and creators making something for the love and passion of it. This is us trying to get our story out there no matter what it takes.
As a passion project we've already put hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars into this project. We're doing this for the love of comics. A successful Kickstarter campaign will allow us to cover any more art costs, print the book, distribute the book, take it to conventions and hopefully continue the series of Beastlands! 

Thank you so much for taking the time to check out our project. We hope you decide to join this campaign and go on an adventure with Mac, Ava and Ping!

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'>Hi, Iï¿½m Danny Boyd, longtime filmmaker and professor, now fully immersed in the graphic novel world. I ask your help in the production of my first epic graphic novel, <strong>CARBON</strong>. The finished product will be a four-book story published as a single volume.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'></span><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'>At this point in my life and career, creating in the graphic narrative format is not only more efficient, but more personally fulfilling. It makes me love production again! I can tell bigger stories, quicker, and still with the possibility of the product eventually making its way to cinema. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'>Most importantly, <strong>CARBON</strong> is near to my heart. It is the biggest thing I've written, and I think the best. For sure a work of the ï¿½fantasticï¿½ (Gods, monsters, and evil coal barons), but with an environmental viewpoint that matches my own - Responsible Green.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'><strong>CARBON</strong> covers an original civilization before ours, ours on the tipping point of extinction, and what, if anything, livable we will leave behind on our current course. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'>The center of <strong>CARBON's</strong> universe? Smack-dab where the original Garden of Eden was ï¿½ Mingo County, WV! And who can save us from this most cataclysmic disaster in our human history? A courageous group of West Virginia coal miners and their community. These unlikely heroes are mankindï¿½s only hope on this edge of the end of the world.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'>I have contracted two of the best graphic novel artists in the world to help me bring <strong>CARBON</strong> to life in illustrator, Edi Guedes, and colorist, Alzir Alves, of Rascunho Studio in Brazil. And right here in Charleston, world-class letterer, Jason Arthur.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'>Upon completion, <strong>CARBON</strong> will be shopped to major publishers. Our first graphic novel, <strong>CHILLERS</strong>, will be released by a national publisher next year (details TBA soon) so I am confident that <strong>CARBON</strong> will have significant publication as well. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><b><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 13.5pt;'>The Impact</span></b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'>Primarily, I hope for an entertaining, commercially successful graphic novel. This is my first opportunity to go ""Epic"" in the entertainment world. I could never have afforded the grand scale of <strong>CARBON</strong> as cinema working outside of the Hollywood system. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'>Rod Serling (Twilight Zone) is my greatest creative influence. He understood that in order to enlighten, especially with controversial subjects, we must first entertain. The subject of coal extraction (both the human labor &amp; environmental issues) is a sticky wicket. It is a polarizing topic where it is hard to find common ground in the present-day ""emotion"" of it all. Perhaps using it as background context in a highly fictionalized entertainment form will allow for a more objective reevaluation. As well, bring a new audience to the issue.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='color: black; font-family: ""Times New Roman"", ""serif""; font-size: 12pt;'>Over 20 years ago I took the lead in leveraging West Virginia as a national and international filmmaking entity. <font color=""#000000""><span style=""""> </span>Many of you were a part of that movement. You partnered with me to do the near-impossible. I ask my old and new friends alike for that partnership again in this exciting, new frontier. </font></span></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Hi, Iï¿½m Danny Boyd, longtime filmmaker and professor, now fully immersed in the graphic novel world. I ask your help in the production of my first epic graphic novel, CARBON. The finished product will be a four-book story published as a single volume.
At this point in my life and career, creating in the graphic narrative format is not only more efficient, but more personally fulfilling. It makes me love production again! I can tell bigger stories, quicker, and still with the possibility of the product eventually making its way to cinema. 
Most importantly, CARBON is near to my heart. It is the biggest thing I've written, and I think the best. For sure a work of the ï¿½fantasticï¿½ (Gods, monsters, and evil coal barons), but with an environmental viewpoint that matches my own - Responsible Green.
CARBON covers an original civilization before ours, ours on the tipping point of extinction, and what, if anything, livable we will leave behind on our current course. 
The center of CARBON's universe? Smack-dab where the original Garden of Eden was ï¿½ Mingo County, WV! And who can save us from this most cataclysmic disaster in our human history? A courageous group of West Virginia coal miners and their community. These unlikely heroes are mankindï¿½s only hope on this edge of the end of the world.
I have contracted two of the best graphic novel artists in the world to help me bring CARBON to life in illustrator, Edi Guedes, and colorist, Alzir Alves, of Rascunho Studio in Brazil. And right here in Charleston, world-class letterer, Jason Arthur.
Upon completion, CARBON will be shopped to major publishers. Our first graphic novel, CHILLERS, will be released by a national publisher next year (details TBA soon) so I am confident that CARBON will have significant publication as well. 
The Impact
Primarily, I hope for an entertaining, commercially successful graphic novel. This is my first opportunity to go ""Epic"" in the entertainment world. I could never have afforded the grand scale of CARBON as cinema working outside of the Hollywood system. 
Rod Serling (Twilight Zone) is my greatest creative influence. He understood that in order to enlighten, especially with controversial subjects, we must first entertain. The subject of coal extraction (both the human labor & environmental issues) is a sticky wicket. It is a polarizing topic where it is hard to find common ground in the present-day ""emotion"" of it all. Perhaps using it as background context in a highly fictionalized entertainment form will allow for a more objective reevaluation. As well, bring a new audience to the issue.
Over 20 years ago I took the lead in leveraging West Virginia as a national and international filmmaking entity.  Many of you were a part of that movement. You partnered with me to do the near-impossible. I ask my old and new friends alike for that partnership again in this exciting, new frontier. 
What We Need & What You Get
What I need is exactly $7,150. $110 a page to pay the artist and letterer to complete the final 65 pages of the book. This is at a super discount to me considering the amazing talent I have assembled. It would typically be 2-3 times more. I already have close to $6,000 of my personal savings into the production of Books 1, 2 and the start of 3. My problem is I ran out of savings. I put my money where my mouth is, but I've run dry.
What you get? Besides being an active partner in the creation of CARBON, I'm giving out lots of goodies! Mini-posters, movies, books, comics, a starring role... Check it out!
Be assured, this book will be completed and released. If not fully funded through this campaign, I will find other ways. It may take me longer to save, but it will be finished. I have a history of getting things done.
Other Ways You Can Help
Straight up, if you can't help, you can't help. I fully understand. Been there myself, when I could and when I couldn't help others financially. So if you can't help due to financial or philosophical reasons, hakuna matata. We remain friends.
You can also help by simply spreading the word through your networks, both about this fundraising campaign, and when the book eventually comes out. Please be my army of reviewers. 
If you would like to contribute in other ways, perhaps through the University, please contact me directly (danny@danielboyd.com).
Many thanks!

<h3>Worum geht's im Buch?</h3>
<p>Ein Dorf ohne Verbrechen ist kein Ort für die wackere Mara Payne, Heldintochter und Klassenbeste der Nachtwache von Zarg.

Gemeinsam mit dem freischaff enden Magier und Tunichtgut Jacop geht sie der Sache auf den Grund.</p>
<p>»Die Pfeffer-Chroniken« ist ein Fantasy-Epos mit einer Prise Noir-Krimi, illustren Figuren, Einhörnern und explodierenden Vögeln, sowie grob geschrotetem, dreckigem Humor. Nachwürzen unnötig.</p>

</div></div>","DIE PFEFFER-CHRONIKEN Hier beim Zwerchfell Verlag haben wir uns ganz besonders gefreut, dass Anna-Maria Jung auch ihr zweites Comicprojekt bei uns verlegen wollte. Mit 212 Seiten ist das Buch nicht nur wirklich dick geworden, wir wollten ihm auch sonst eine besonders schöne Ausstattung zukommen lassen: mattkaschiertes Hardcover, und der Titelzug in eitel gold'ner Folienprägung glänzend.
Worum geht's im Buch?
Ein Dorf ohne Verbrechen ist kein Ort für die wackere Mara Payne, Heldintochter und Klassenbeste der Nachtwache von Zarg. Mit dem Schwert ihrer Mutter und zwei Satteltaschen voll Gerechtigkeit reitet sie gen Acco, einem Ort voller Gefahren, Korruption und Ungeziefer, um es in der großen Stadt zu schaff en. Doch als Mara auf eine okkulte Mordserie stößt, dämmert ihr, dass sie zu viel von der extrascharfen Chilischote abgebissen hat. Gemeinsam mit dem freischaff enden Magier und Tunichtgut Jacop geht sie der Sache auf den Grund.
»Die Pfeffer-Chroniken« ist ein Fantasy-Epos mit einer Prise Noir-Krimi, illustren Figuren, Einhörnern und explodierenden Vögeln, sowie grob geschrotetem, dreckigem Humor. Nachwürzen unnötig.

Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst
Wir können Dir »Die Pfeffer-Chroniken« hier zum Subskriptionspreis anbieten. Das heißt, wenn Du uns vor dem Erstverkaufstag schon ein Buch abkaufst, bekommst Du es günstiger. Und zwar 10 Euro günstiger. Und einen exklusiven, signierten Druck mit dabei. Der Erlös hilft uns, unsere Druckerei schneller zu bezahlen und dadurch ein aufwändiger produziertes Buch anbieten zu können – wir selber nehmen davon nichts ein.

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">What’s ARTAN?</h1>
<p>Artan is a Scifi-Fantasy comic entirely realized
by three-dimensional graphics.</p>
<p>Its story takes place between two worlds:
Barsec and Artan. Barsec is an over populated planet where the population has taken
advantage in an uncontrolled way of its planet, destroying both the vegetation
and the animal world. For this reason, a large group of rich and privileged settlers
left the mother planet to colonize another habitable planet in the same solar system
of Nikron: ARTAN.</p>
<p>When the settlers come, Artan is a virgin planet,
full of vegetation and living beings. A perfect planet to create a new
civilization based on a more rigorous and controlled life style than the one left
on Barsec. But when the settlers arrive, they find another species was already living
on Artan: the Artakans.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>The Artakans, proud and brave community, live
in symbiosis with the nature that surrounds them, and without the aid of any technology.
At the beginning, the visitors are welcomed with peaceful intent, and the two
parties agree with a treaty which allows Barsecans to settle in the south islands
of the planet. But during the meeting, an Artakan faction adverse to the
agreement, the ""Elyfan"", by surprise attacks the Barsecans, compromising
also the safety of the unaware Artakan delegation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The Barsecans, in virtue of their technology
and their numerical superiority, begin a bloody war. At the end of the
conflict, the two sides enter a contractual agreement that allows Barsecans to
settle in the southland of Artan, within ten districts.</p>

<br/>
<p>The Artanians (new name for the Barsecans colonists
settled now on Artan), because of their locked hormone, have a low labor force,
finding themselves forced to ask for support to their planet of origin Barsec.
Thanks to an extension granted by Artakians, the Artanians can ask every ten years
for a number of Barsecans guys sufficient to perform the most unpretentious and
necessary tasks to support the fully developed Artanians economy. After ten years,
however, all those guys are forced to return to their planet, without any dispensation.
In return, the Artanians provide Barsec the raw materials needed to allow survival
to a dying planet.</p>
<p>Our comic’s history begins 500 years from the
conflict. Centuries later, a special girl is coming to Artan on a cargo ship. But
the planet hides a big secret that will change the fate of the Galaxy.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Making of</h1>
<p>Why was Artan born? </p>
<p>Artan was born from the idea of being able to
create something new, never tried before: a digital comic created with
techniques used so far only for games and cinematography. The first approach is
identical. After an initial study of the characters and the different
environments, with classic sketches and drawings, we got to create our characters
with the 3d modeling softwares available on the market. Right away, the amount
of work and the difficulties were enormous, both for the hardware resources we
got available to us (we have to work with millions of polygons for each scene),
both for the high costs of the softwares we had to use. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1151513/files/20150115085150-comp.jpg?1421340710"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/><p>One example: for the
realization of some cities (Artancity, Arlea, Rometik, etc ...) we used
CityEngine, while recreating the environments we used Vue 2013. The huge number
of main characters (about fifty), and extra characters (more than 10,000) and
environments (over 300) has led us to work tirelessly for two years on the
project. All was made even more complex by a rich and well-articulate
storyboard that led us to create a comic with a high number of pages.</p>

Hello everyone. 
We are Stefano Orlando and Gianfranco Casano
and we are two guys who strongly believe in their dreams. “Artan” project begins
long ago, and it starts from that primordial instinct we are all born with, that
drives us to go towards distant and exotic worlds to live thousand adventures
and thousand emotions.
The idea of this project was born part humorously,
part seriously, but, after months and months of sacrifice and commitment, Artan
has become not only our job, but even our world, where some times we pour our fears
and our desires.
How many of you dreamed to do a job you love?
That’s it: we are chasing this dream.






What’s ARTAN?
Artan is a Scifi-Fantasy comic entirely realized
by three-dimensional graphics.
Its story takes place between two worlds:
Barsec and Artan. Barsec is an over populated planet where the population has taken
advantage in an uncontrolled way of its planet, destroying both the vegetation
and the animal world. For this reason, a large group of rich and privileged settlers
left the mother planet to colonize another habitable planet in the same solar system
of Nikron: ARTAN.
When the settlers come, Artan is a virgin planet,
full of vegetation and living beings. A perfect planet to create a new
civilization based on a more rigorous and controlled life style than the one left
on Barsec. But when the settlers arrive, they find another species was already living
on Artan: the Artakans.





The Artakans, proud and brave community, live
in symbiosis with the nature that surrounds them, and without the aid of any technology.
At the beginning, the visitors are welcomed with peaceful intent, and the two
parties agree with a treaty which allows Barsecans to settle in the south islands
of the planet. But during the meeting, an Artakan faction adverse to the
agreement, the ""Elyfan"", by surprise attacks the Barsecans, compromising
also the safety of the unaware Artakan delegation.

The Barsecans, in virtue of their technology
and their numerical superiority, begin a bloody war. At the end of the
conflict, the two sides enter a contractual agreement that allows Barsecans to
settle in the southland of Artan, within ten districts.



A peace with Artakans has however three conditions:
1) 
The
lock by Barsecans of their sex hormone to prevent an overpopulation of the
planet
2) 
The
lock of the boundaries to prevent other unauthorized Barsecans to reach Artan
3) 
A
total ban for Barsecans to overcome their borders and to reach the North of the
planet (which seems to hide something very important).



The Artanians (new name for the Barsecans colonists
settled now on Artan), because of their locked hormone, have a low labor force,
finding themselves forced to ask for support to their planet of origin Barsec.
Thanks to an extension granted by Artakians, the Artanians can ask every ten years

necessary tasks to support the fully developed Artanians economy. After ten years,
however, all those guys are forced to return to their planet, without any dispensation.
In return, the Artanians provide Barsec the raw materials needed to allow survival
to a dying planet.
Our comic’s history begins 500 years from the
conflict. Centuries later, a special girl is coming to Artan on a cargo ship. But
the planet hides a big secret that will change the fate of the Galaxy.

The Authors:
Gianfranco Casano:
Graduated at the University of Pisa, he starts immediately
teaching three-dimensional graphics in the high schools and at the University
of Pisa. Simultaneously he realizes several projects:
He works at Pisa’s University in the “Project Antarctica”.
He writes music for the Project ""Francis, the man, the saint, the places""
published by Paoline Editions
He realizes a multimedia DVD on Astronomical Photography.
He directs and writes the theme song of the TV
program: ""Bambino sarai tu""
broadcasted by Sky - Italy.
He realizes three-dimensional animations on the
Italian DVDs of the award winning show ""Farscape"".
He has collaborated for several years with the
Italian Rotary Club creating DVDs for the International Prize G. Galilei.
Often collaborates with National Geographic.
In 2014 he published the SciFi book ""Late
Time"" on Amazon.
Stefano Orlando:
He is a computer technician who studied engineering
at the University of Pisa. Soon, however, he understood that he could not stand
out too much from his artistic nature.
This was the reason that led him to study the
techniques of three-dimensional graphics and to enhance the creative talents at
his disposal. During these years, he has written three books: ""The thin life of a poet"" ""The excluded ones"" and ""The man who dreamed of the sea"",
and he is currently working at the fourth: ""The apology of the six worlds "", a fantasy trilogy that aims
to enter the innermost aspects of our social system and our psyche. But that's another
story.
Among his many passions, including photography
(http://www.sitohd.com/stefanoorlando/index.asp), astronomy and music, trekking
is definitely the one that most of all has managed over the years to bring out
its puerile part, that piece of himself that still gets excited and wonders at
the little things that the world can offer. That same part that pushed him,
along with his friend and colleague, to create Artan.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>More about

<p>Monsters
serve a purpose in every age. They confront us with qualities in the world, and
in ourselves, that we find difficult to face. And without artists to create
them — from Gorgon to Godzilla — there would be no monsters at all. – This fact
prompted me to dig deeper into how to apply this to my artwork.  This is where I started to envision “MONSTERS OF FEAR AND WONDER” and
all the possible benefits:</p>

<h3>Robo Pram - Phase 1: The Artist Search</h3>
<p>What do you get when you mix an alien, a baby, his cluelss father and confused mother, and a host of the cutest, cuddliest Earth invaders ever seen?  Robo Pram!</p>
<p>Robo Pram was an idea born while cruising the Santa Clarita Valley way back in 2007.  In the 5 years since, I have filled multiple notebooks with ideas and poor sketches of what my take on an all ages comic book could be, culminating in two 22 page scripts completed last summer.  I am immensely proud of the writing I've completed here, with two story arcs worthy of illustration.  This is part Transformers, a little Lone Wolf and Cub, and a dash of Looney Tunes!  I know that kids of all ages will thoroughly enjoy the adventures of the Robo Pram team and you can help make it happen!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where's the Cash Going Buddy?</h3>
</div>
<div> The bulk of this (Phase 1) money will go to securing an artist to draw the books.  The scripts are polished and ready to go, I just need some talent to breath Robo Pram to life.  While I am offering an even 50/50 creator credit for this project to my artist, the ability to offer some financial incentive will make it easier for us to complete the project faster and to set a reasonable publishing timeline, including whether or not we will attempt a color printing!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$500 is my baseline goal.  For that, the ball gets rolling in my artist search, including being able to take some out of town meetings I have set for mid-July as well as fulfilling the button perks listed in this campaign.  This is a modest sum and a goal I feel is reasonable at this juncture.  However, above and beyond will really bring Robo Pram to life!  For example:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$1000 will allow me to pay my artist and set the publishing ball in motion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$1500 and the book will be published.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$2000 and above, both scripts, two full story arcs of Robo Pram will be illustrated and published.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we miss our $500 goal, any money contributed will still be used to secure artwork.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Contribute today and be in the know for all the updates on the development of Robo Pram including design and script page teasers!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>ALL CONTRIBUTORS WILL RECEIVE A DISCOUNT ON ORDERING THE BOOK WHEN PUBLISHED!!!  Preorders will commence once the book is 50% illustrated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For me, seeing my writing transformed into a comic book will fulfill a long held dream, a dream that I need your help in creating!  Please let your friends know about this campaign as even $1 will mean the world to me!  Share us on Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr or just force your co-worker to look at your screen!  Seriously, without you, Robo Pram cannot happen, period.  I'm cashing in my karma points for this one everybody, please help out any way you can.  Thank you!!!!</div></div>","Robo Pram - Phase 1: The Artist Search

<p><b>WHO IS ARTY NEED?</b></p>
<p>I am an 18 inch talk show host that has been doing a live
talk show in the back of a bowling alley for the last 3 years. </p>
<p><b>WHAT IS THE ARTY NEED SHOW ALL ABOUT?</b></p>
<p>Arty is the place to catch underground comics, bands, and
performers and watch them be interviewed by a marionette. </p>
<p><b>WHAT IS AT STAKE?</b></p>
<p>If Arty doesn’t get his show on TV, late night television
will stay the same boring landscape of guys behind desks! Isn’t it time for a
Marionette to have his own talk show? </p>
<p><b>WHY $5000?</b></p>
<p>After years of doing a live show, Arty is ready for the
small screen. Yes, TV. To make this possible I need to record the show in a
professional manner, which requires a lot of manpower, and if you have seen the
show you know that I am busy telling jokes, so I need to pay these people. </p>
<p>But why FIVE THOUSAND dollars? Shooting with multiple
cameras means multiple people, and multiple cameras means more to edit. I don’t
have a clue how to do this but fortunately there are people who do, but they
aren’t free. </p>

I am an 18 inch talk show host that has been doing a live
talk show in the back of a bowling alley for the last 3 years. 
WHAT IS THE ARTY NEED SHOW ALL ABOUT?
Arty is the place to catch underground comics, bands, and
performers and watch them be interviewed by a marionette. 
WHAT IS AT STAKE?
If Arty doesn’t get his show on TV, late night television
will stay the same boring landscape of guys behind desks! Isn’t it time for a
Marionette to have his own talk show? 
WHY $5000?
After years of doing a live show, Arty is ready for the
small screen. Yes, TV. To make this possible I need to record the show in a
professional manner, which requires a lot of manpower, and if you have seen the
show you know that I am busy telling jokes, so I need to pay these people. 
But why FIVE THOUSAND dollars? Shooting with multiple
cameras means multiple people, and multiple cameras means more to edit. I don’t
have a clue how to do this but fortunately there are people who do, but they
aren’t free. 
Lastly…

<h3>The Offer</h3>
<p>The Road to Nowhere features a selection of cartoons from my weekly spot on Wings Over Scotland plus a few previously unpublished. It (mostly) charts the UK's journey along the Yellow Brick Road towards the mythical city of Ooze, home to the Brexit swamp of national humiliation and economic self-harm. Our companions – May, Johnson, Farage and Corbyn – comprise a perfect storm of accidental promotion, deviousness, and incompetence. It would be hard to think of a cast more guaranteed to reduce 'Great' Britain to this sorry pass.</p>
<p>The frequent complaint of the Rev Stu Campbell, editor of Wings – a specifically Scottish political website – is that over these past couple of years there has been a dearth of actual Scottish political content to report, analyse and comment upon. That, unavoidably, is reflected over the course of 176 pages of cartoons which feature more than their fair share of Brexit metaphors. If you don't like pictures of cliffs perhaps this book isn't for you.</p>
<p>But that is not to say we have entirely forgotten about the goings-on at Holyrood and, indeed, Westminster among Scotland's elected representatives. Even if only for some light relief from the Brexit Greek tragedy, it was always worthwhile checking in from time to time on Willie Rennie, Ruth Davidson, David Mundell, and whatsisname. Rest assured their respective inanities and hypocrisies receive due attention within these pages.</p>
<p>Printed in full colour (except when I've managed to sneak a monochrome 'toon past Stu) on matt coated art paper with a gloss laminated cover, The Road to Nowhere is 24cm x 24cm (9.5"" x 9.5"") and comes in soft and hardback versions. I'm delighted to say it features both a foreword from Andrew Tickell of The National and Sunday National, and postscript by Stu Campbell.</p>
<p>I'm offering four levels of perks for contributors keen to get their hands on a signed and numbered first edition copy in either hard or softback. Special, limited edition mugs and t-shirts featuring Hamish, Scotland's favourite lion in a tammy, are available depending on the level of contribution made. <strong>(Click on the individual perk for details.)</strong></p>

<h3>What is Needed</h3>

<p><strong>At the time of writing, those four Wizard of Oz characters of the Apocalypse have taken the UK to the very precipice of Brexit.

Well, I'm here to help you understand why I am here.. So first of all- Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Rebecca- Although I am known as Becky or SquishyBooo on the internet. I am 18 years old and from the UK, and I have drawn ever since I was a young child.<br/></p><p>After receiving the funds, I will be starting a new web comic idea that I have had for a while now! Let me explain to you in the simplest of terms- just to make it easy for you..! :</p><p>The web comic would be called: 'More', the comic itself would be a biweekly released comic about random stories or experiences that I have heard about or experienced myself! The meaning behind the name of the comic is super simple- it means that I can show you 'more' of my drawings.</p><p><br/></p><p>If people do decide to help me out.. I would be so thankful... I'm in one of those tough situations in life, like most people, where I'm not as privileged as other families/people because I don't get masses amounts of money to spend.. So I have to work hard for the money I earn. So, if you guys do make this possible I will be offering some perks for you! Not many though, as the perks would be similar due to the topic/idea for the funding being so small (which is poopy).</p> <p><br/></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Funding Idea</h3> <p>I need £740 in total, which is around $1255.. Which is a lot- I know. The full amount of money will be spent on a single item!- A Wacom Cintiq 13HD graphics tablet. I know this may sound a little expensive- it is -but since my current tablet is slowly dying, I would need to spend more of my savings on another graphics tablet. If I do receive the funds, I would then use the new tablet to start work on the comic idea that I have, which I explained above.</p><p>OKAYYYY. My ""unique"" perks are listed at the side, I don't have many perks since there aren't many things I can think of. To be honest with you guys, I lack creative ideas for things like this.. However, if I do not reach the goal for the tablet, I will be saving the money so that I can try and save up enough money for the tablet I have mentioned above.</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The difference that your contributions would make are huge! I would be so overwhelmed by the help that you have offered to me, to help make my aspirations come true. The idea of becoming a Digital Artist means that you need expensive equipment, and that's poop, but if you did help me with the funding for this tablet- I would be very thankful and even if you can't donate much, it would still help out in some way, shape or form.</p><p>When producing pieces of art work, I have been very punctual when handing in my work. I have worked for quite a few YouTubers/Twitch Streamers since starting my internet existence under the name of 'SquishyBooo', and the experience that they have offered me- by letting me work as their artist- have been the best times of my life.. This may sound very cheesy, but I see all these brilliant artists around on the internet, and I have always aspired to be as good as them, and when a person (who I look up to) tells me that my art is great, I feel amazing.. And when people offer to pay me for art commissions, that makes me feel great too. The experience in which I have gained in this sector may be smaller than other people's, but I promise you- I will not waste or slack off with this opportunity that you people would be able to make available to me!</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't doante any money to my cause, I don't mind!

Well, I'm here to help you understand why I am here.. So first of all- Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Rebecca- Although I am known as Becky or SquishyBooo on the internet. I am 18 years old and from the UK, and I have drawn ever since I was a young child.After receiving the funds, I will be starting a new web comic idea that I have had for a while now! Let me explain to you in the simplest of terms- just to make it easy for you..! :The web comic would be called: 'More', the comic itself would be a biweekly released comic about random stories or experiences that I have heard about or experienced myself! The meaning behind the name of the comic is super simple- it means that I can show you 'more' of my drawings.If people do decide to help me out.. I would be so thankful... I'm in one of those tough situations in life, like most people, where I'm not as privileged as other families/people because I don't get masses amounts of money to spend.. So I have to work hard for the money I earn. So, if you guys do make this possible I will be offering some perks for you! Not many though, as the perks would be similar due to the topic/idea for the funding being so small (which is poopy).    The Funding Idea I need £740 in total, which is around $1255.. Which is a lot- I know. The full amount of money will be spent on a single item!- A Wacom Cintiq 13HD graphics tablet. I know this may sound a little expensive- it is -but since my current tablet is slowly dying, I would need to spend more of my savings on another graphics tablet. If I do receive the funds, I would then use the new tablet to start work on the comic idea that I have, which I explained above.OKAYYYY. My ""unique"" perks are listed at the side, I don't have many perks since there aren't many things I can think of. To be honest with you guys, I lack creative ideas for things like this.. However, if I do not reach the goal for the tablet, I will be saving the money so that I can try and save up enough money for the tablet I have mentioned above.   The Impact The difference that your contributions would make are huge! I would be so overwhelmed by the help that you have offered to me, to help make my aspirations come true. The idea of becoming a Digital Artist means that you need expensive equipment, and that's poop, but if you did help me with the funding for this tablet- I would be very thankful and even if you can't donate much, it would still help out in some way, shape or form.When producing pieces of art work, I have been very punctual when handing in my work. I have worked for quite a few YouTubers/Twitch Streamers since starting my internet existence under the name of 'SquishyBooo', and the experience that they have offered me- by letting me work as their artist- have been the best times of my life.. This may sound very cheesy, but I see all these brilliant artists around on the internet, and I have always aspired to be as good as them, and when a person (who I look up to) tells me that my art is great, I feel amazing.. And when people offer to pay me for art commissions, that makes me feel great too. The experience in which I have gained in this sector may be smaller than other people's, but I promise you- I will not waste or slack off with this opportunity that you people would be able to make available to me!   Other Ways You Can Help If you can't doante any money to my cause, I don't mind! You can help in other ways.. For example, you could share the link to this page around on your Twitter or Facebook, or any other social media website! That would be super helpful, and I would be totally greatful!Examples of My WorkI hope that this information and the drawings above help persuade you into helping me with my campaign.Thank you for reading this-  Becky.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Thanks for checking out my campaign. My name is John and I am a comic book writer. Growing up with comics like the x-men, I found that comics were my favorite form of literature at an early age. For the last seven years I have been writing and creating stories, but not until last year did I actually begin to get the comics drawn. I am hoping to get my first comic published in October (and that's why I am here).</p>
<p>This comic book is the first issue in a series that follows four unlikely heroes across the world in an attempt to save humanity from the rising robot threat. </p>
The story takes place in the year is 2085. Humanity is waging a war for survival against the growing robot threat. When the comic starts, the war has been raging for seven years and the humans are really starting to lose ground. In a last desperate attempt to turn the tide of the war, the government creates a secret ""questionably legal"" program designed to create machine fighting super soldiers. Due to the nature of the project, the test subjects are federal prisoners offered their freedom in return for the use of their bodies. Trying to make a safe choice, the government chooses five medium security inmates, but get a lot more than they asked for. Though the project was a success, it is shut down soon after the first tests due to some ""sensitive"" information being ""anonymously""leaked. This story follows the misadventures Jet, Wrench, Boombox, and Axel, four of the five delinquents.</div>

<h3><strong>The Campaign</strong></h3>
<p>This project is a fun one because while it is a little rough around the edges, and the heroes are older, it is suitable for readers of all ages. To complete this project, I am asking for $870. The comic is all drawn up and inked, and is just needing to be grey toned and lettered.</p>
<p>$270 goes for grey tones and $600 goes for publishing costs.</p>
<p>Funding is flexible and so the money will used to accomplish as much as it can even if we dont reach our goal.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>If you can't help financially thats fine, just help share the campaign with your friends and if the can donate, you can read their comic. You can share through facebook and the indiegogo share tools.</p>

<h3>Jake dh - Author with a vision</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Jake dh, well that's my pen name.  During my early years in junior high and high school I was constantly bullied.  As a defense mechanism, I created a series of novels that chronicled a boy named Kyle Richard who was in a similar situation.  Kyle gained vast power and speed through becoming a cyborg.  He had to decide to use this power for what is was designed for: killing... or become something better.</p>
<p>This story stuck with me for years until I created comic book scripts based on the concept in my college years.  I tried to obtain funding for art on a couple of occasions, but the comic book series was always just out of reach.  </p>
<p>I decided to convert the story back into a novel series, but with a better story structure, character development, etc.  I wrote The BulletProof Ghost: Prototypes from scratch.  The first book led into a second, The BulletProof Ghost: In Spades.  </p>
<p>It always bugged me that I couldn't reach my goal of creating a BulletProof Ghost comic book.  So here I am, trying for one final time to crowdfund the BPG comic book, Issue #1, which is tentatively titled, Trials.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The BulletProof Ghost: From Words to Illustration</h3>
<p>What I need to complete my dream:</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is for $3,000.  The money will go to the illustrations for the interior of the book.  I just used the last of my novel profits for the external cover.  Some of the funds will go to printing costs, taxes, rewards, and Indiegogo fees.  I'm trying to be 100% transparent.  I'm not using any of this money for personal... anything.  Just art and printing!</li>
<li>You can look at the perks section to get more specifics, but the perks range from free digital versions of the novels and the comic to signed copies of the final comic book.  There are also shirts you can only get via pledging to this campaign and customized BulletProof Ghost decorated Funko POP.  The larger rewards include large posters, having your likeness drawn into the book itself, and having an original piece of art drawn starring you with chracters from the BPG universe.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal, whatever funds I have, will go into as much art as I can commission with the available amount.  I will adjust the rewards to reflect this lesser amount.  Then over time, I will complete the entire issue, but the timeline will be extremely long in comparison to a fully funded project.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>  </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is that the campaign doesn't reach its goal, which is possible, but everyone who pledges will get a reward, even it takes more time to get it to them.  I have confidence that my new readership wants to see The BulletProof Ghost.... Kyle Richard, Irene Hedwin,  William Kintaxin &amp; Four come to life in full color.  They want something tangible and together we can make that a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Considering the lowest perk level is literally $1, I'm sure most people can swing that, but... if your affordable perk level leaves you feeling like you haven't done enough to help create the BPG comic, then there are a lot ways to help other than moneys.</p>
<p>Share, share, share.  Post the link to this campaign as well as BulletProofGhost.com as much as possible to anyone who you think might be interested.  Tell your friends, family and coworkers.  If you have a copy of the novels, loan them out.  Spread the word to every corner of the world, virtual and real life.</p>

<p><strong>A Six Part Mini Series created and written by</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ross Thibodeaux</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>For <strong>Mason Vaughn</strong>, life is busy. If it isn't taking on inner city gangs as a vigilante, it's handling the ups and downs of his new interracial relationship with his girlfriend <strong>Samantha</strong>. However, things take a decidedly different turn when he finally meets Sam's disapproving uncle/surrogate father and former '70's vigilante <strong>Deacon ""Black's Law"" Black</strong> and becomes inspired, much like a certain millionaire playboy was inspired by a certain creature of the night, to adopt Deacon's feared and forgotten persona for his own crimefighting needs introducing the world to the new face of justice...<strong>SONOFBLACKSLAW(Son of Black's Law)!</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile a new evil rises with a plan so heinous, so despicable that only an unlikely alliance between the two men(of course) stands a chance against it. But before ebony and ivory can live together in harmony one question still remains: Does Deacon REALLY have a problem with the color of Mason's skin or is he just being overprotective of his niece?  Find out in this light-hearted satire with a serious ""after taste"" which takes aim at social, economical, political and pop culture events and icons. Set all that against a Batman-meets-blaxploitation(<em>Sweetback's Badass Song</em>, <em>Shaft</em>, <em>Black Dynamite</em> and <em>Django Unchained) </em>backdrop and you have yourself a masked vigilante story unlike any other.</p>
<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>
<p>The creative team consists of comic book vet <strong>Jason Johnson</strong>(<em>Wetworks, Godstorm</em>) providing the artwork, colorist <strong>James Rochelle</strong> giving us a tapestry of color from page to page as well as a few others working in comics namely <strong>Kody Chamberlain</strong>(<em>Sweets, Punks</em>) <strong>Rob Guillory</strong>(<em>Chew</em>) and <strong>Burt Durand</strong>(<em>Horseecomics</em>) supplying us with some cool perks in exchange for your help. Finally of course, yours truly as creator, writer and grandmaster of the project.</p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<p>In exchange for your contributions we have great perks set up. The way they work is you choose which one you want at it's designated price and once the campaign is over you'll have whichever one you chose sent out to you! There are also combined tiers. For example, say you pick up the <strong>Ultimate Team-up perk </strong>for $75<strong>, </strong>you'll get whatever new item that tier added plus all the tiers before it all for $75! Get it? On tap will be full color posters, sketch books, original artwork, digital comic book downloads, trading cards, original scripts and much more! And hey, if you can't spare the cash then simply share this campaign with your buds. The more people we get talking about this thing the better.</p>
<p><strong>Where Does My Contribution Go?</strong></p>
<p>I know that goal looks intimidating and you might be thinking,""All that for a comic book?!"" To get the artwork done for the entire mini series plus the cost of producing, packaging and shipping the perks out to contributers and the fees involved with the campaign being hosted by this site that amount should near us to completion. However, if we don't reach our goal then whatever funds generated will definitely be a jump start we didn't have before and for that we thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Sonofblackslaw isn't just an opportunity for me to mash a few genres together but it's also a chance for me to speak out on the grudge I have against what I see going on in our society, in the world. Call me a hopeless optimist but I really do believe we can do a lot better and it all starts with the central theme of my story, us getting along and working together. If my humble project can convey that subtle message buried beneath a fun and exciting story then mission accomplished.</p></div>","SONOFBLACKSLAW

The creative team consists of comic book vet Jason Johnson(Wetworks, Godstorm) providing the artwork, colorist James Rochelle giving us a tapestry of color from page to page as well as a few others working in comics namely Kody Chamberlain(Sweets, Punks) Rob Guillory(Chew) and Burt Durand(Horseecomics) supplying us with some cool perks in exchange for your help. Finally of course, yours truly as creator, writer and grandmaster of the project.
The Perks
In exchange for your contributions we have great perks set up. The way they work is you choose which one you want at it's designated price and once the campaign is over you'll have whichever one you chose sent out to you! There are also combined tiers. For example, say you pick up the Ultimate Team-up perk for $75, you'll get whatever new item that tier added plus all the tiers before it all for $75! Get it? On tap will be full color posters, sketch books, original artwork, digital comic book downloads, trading cards, original scripts and much more! And hey, if you can't spare the cash then simply share this campaign with your buds. The more people we get talking about this thing the better.
Where Does My Contribution Go?
I know that goal looks intimidating and you might be thinking,""All that for a comic book?!"" To get the artwork done for the entire mini series plus the cost of producing, packaging and shipping the perks out to contributers and the fees involved with the campaign being hosted by this site that amount should near us to completion. However, if we don't reach our goal then whatever funds generated will definitely be a jump start we didn't have before and for that we thank you.
Final Thoughts
Sonofblackslaw isn't just an opportunity for me to mash a few genres together but it's also a chance for me to speak out on the grudge I have against what I see going on in our society, in the world. Call me a hopeless optimist but I really do believe we can do a lot better and it all starts with the central theme of my story, us getting along and working together. If my humble project can convey that subtle message buried beneath a fun and exciting story then mission accomplished.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Help the Northlake Public Library get a 9-foot-tall Incredible Hulk statue, graphic novels and a </strong><strong>creation station featuring:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iMac with a drawing pad</strong></li>

</ul><div>Libraries are constantly changing and evolving beyond just a place to do school work and use the internet. Today’s libraries are celebrating creativity, entertainment and life long learning, and they are doing it with technology and popular materials including graphic novels. The problem is that many people still think of libraries in the old way. We want to smash that stuffy reputation with a 9 foot tall <strong>Incredible Hulk Statue</strong>. </div>
<p>Why The Hulk? Just as Dr. Bruce Banner transforms into the Hulk, we want our library community members to make their own personal transformations through books, programs, and awesome new equipment. This larger-than-life literary character will become a giant green beacon of light to highlight our graphic novel collection, our creation station…not to mention the library’s sense of humor and whimsy. The project will show off the fun side of the library and get the community talking. The HULK will force patrons to look at the library in a whole new way.</p>
<p>Art Spiegelman, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>Maus, </em>once said that “comics are a gateway drug to literacy.” We want people of all ages to start reading these addictive and powerful books. Help us grow our collection to epic proportions.</p>
<p>We also want to promote digital literacy and provide patrons with a spot where they can create their own comics, art, movies and experiment with digital design and photo editing. We want to provide patrons with a glimpse into the future with cutting edge technology like 3D printers.</p>
<p>For the average household these resources are cost prohibitive, but with your help, we can provide them to an entire community!</p>
<p>We want everyone who helps this project to be able to take advantage of everything we get so be assured that if you come to the library even if you don't have a Northlake library card you will be able to use our new technology that this project provides. </p>
<p>Here is everything and a few ideas of what can be done with them: </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/td1inK1mLIdE7zokrsPH86eF6ep-0ko4ttrzxn_sCQKBbwK5UQBT3WnchUcLV0YMKi6IPAOd4oKF1gQaMlNlJ0x2S5OhxEDOEzDI2b7q41yQVhpR36j1UtWS"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>

<p><span><em>With the 3D printer, patrons will be able to bring their designs to life. If they create a new character they can design and print a action figure of it. Of course it has many more uses such as making prototypes of new products</em>.</span></p>

<p><em>With the Light Tracer Elite, our younger patrons will be able to practice drawing and tracing. Our older patrons who would like to create comics by hand will find this a useful tool to make final edits of their work.</em></p>
<h2><span><strong><em><a href=""http://librarycomics.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Plus many more graphic novels for both kids and adults.

<h3><span>If we do not raise the full amount, we will first use the funds to purchase the statue, then a mix of technology and graphic novels. </span></h3>
<h3><span>If we don't raise enough to purchase the statue, we will use the funds to purchase new graphic novels. This is just the back-up plan as we fully intend to reach our goal to get everything. </span></h3>

Art Spiegelman, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Maus, once said that “comics are a gateway drug to literacy.” We want people of all ages to start reading these addictive and powerful books. Help us grow our collection to epic proportions.
We also want to promote digital literacy and provide patrons with a spot where they can create their own comics, art, movies and experiment with digital design and photo editing. We want to provide patrons with a glimpse into the future with cutting edge technology like 3D printers.
For the average household these resources are cost prohibitive, but with your help, we can provide them to an entire community!
We want everyone who helps this project to be able to take advantage of everything we get so be assured that if you come to the library even if you don't have a Northlake library card you will be able to use our new technology that this project provides. 
Here is everything and a few ideas of what can be done with them: 

 
The statue will attract new readers to the library as well as highlight the graphic novel collection.

 
With an iMac, patrons will be able to edit videos, images and even podcasts. With the drawing tablet, they will also be able to draw their own comics.
 
 

With the Cintiq, patrons will be able to use the same machine that many modern comic artists use to create comics!
 

With the 3D printer, patrons will be able to bring their designs to life. If they create a new character they can design and print a action figure of it. Of course it has many more uses such as making prototypes of new products.

With the Light Tracer Elite, our younger patrons will be able to practice drawing and tracing. Our older patrons who would like to create comics by hand will find this a useful tool to make final edits of their work.
Plus many more graphic novels for both kids and adults. You will be able to request them to be sent to your library if you aren't a patron of the Northlake Public Library District! Here is our tumblr list of some of the newest adult graphic novels you can browse through now. 
If we do not raise the full amount, we will first use the funds to purchase the statue, then a mix of technology and graphic novels. 
If we don't raise enough to purchase the statue, we will use the funds to purchase new graphic novels. This is just the back-up plan as we fully intend to reach our goal to get everything.

is the story of a superhero pitted against the government
as the government tries to enslave humanity once and for all. He is
a young man with extraordinary powers created through a chance encounter with
cosmic radiation. His personal mission is to rescue his parents from government
agents, but that objective is often frustrated with the likes of giant
monsters, super-villains, and even the U.S. armed forces. This is a special issue with other characters in the Voluntaryist team.When the U.S. government decides to test a new mind control
chemical on the public, they get more brain-for-the-buck than they hoped for! Zombification
leads to Keynesian-style economic “stimulus” and a relentless inquiry of, “Who
will build the roads?” Fortunately, the liberty-loving ladies of Voluntaryist might
be able to to curtail the chaos…but can they do it without violating the N.A.P.?

My name is Leyre, and i am spanish.  I'm an illustrator and I am currently in Bangkok working on a new project: ""Bangkok underwater"".<br/>My project is a graphic novel about Bangkok and the hard time the city is going through as a consequence of the floods. It is also a personal vision of the city, its bustling streets and its people, a portrait of its everyday life in which I provide an account of what is happening through drawings and text.<br/>Upon getting here and going out for a walk I was surprised by the amount of people in the street that were smiling. A lot of them were leaving there homes, carrying their belongings on their heads and backs, or loading them into makeshift boats, the water the height of their chest. Various areas of the city are immersed in chaos, whole avenues completely flooded, shops shut down, houses underwater, and people dying electrocuted or bitten by venomous snakes.<br/>IÂ´m going to finish the graphic novel in the next five months, which is the time to spend in Bangkok. The drawings are made in watercolor and pen, size smaller at a din A4.</span></font></p>

</div></div>","My Story

Hi everyone! My name is Leyre, and i am spanish.  I'm an illustrator and I am currently in Bangkok working on a new project: ""Bangkok underwater"".My project is a graphic novel about Bangkok and the hard time the city is going through as a consequence of the floods. It is also a personal vision of the city, its bustling streets and its people, a portrait of its everyday life in which I provide an account of what is happening through drawings and text.Upon getting here and going out for a walk I was surprised by the amount of people in the street that were smiling. A lot of them were leaving there homes, carrying their belongings on their heads and backs, or loading them into makeshift boats, the water the height of their chest. Various areas of the city are immersed in chaos, whole avenues completely flooded, shops shut down, houses underwater, and people dying electrocuted or bitten by venomous snakes.IÂ´m going to finish the graphic novel in the next five months, which is the time to spend in Bangkok. The drawings are made in watercolor and pen, size smaller at a din A4.

The Impact



The donation from you will go directly to support the publishing of "" Disaster Survival Handbook"" - a series  of collective guidelines visualizing how an individual can save his/her life and the life of others in the time of disasters.
With your support, these handbooks will be distributed to the underprivileged children in the slums of Bangkok particularly those who live in the flood-affected areas. The handbook is meant to be creatively informative and entertaining to brighten up the children's days. We hope that with this great little step together, we can help the children to be equipped with knowledge and skills to tackle with the uncertainty of disasters in the future.


To help make Life of the underprivileged children more resilient to disasters, we cordially invite you to take this journey with us. It is a long way to go but we never hesitate to begin every single step optimistically.

The projects and activities they are developing can be seen on their website: 
http://www.designfordisasters.org/



Design for Disasters - D4D


Formed in January 2010, design for Disaster or D4D is made up of young designers, artist and academics. Gerenal public is also welcome to share ideas and find long-term solutions for everyone to be prepared for natural disasters, particularly those resulting from extreme weather, which may attack the city any moment.
Without an obligation, members are committed to help whit any projects, based on their expertise and schedule. Each project, therefore, will see regulars tapping hands and new faces.
D4D- anon profit network formed out of our ""intentionalism"" rather than ""capitalism""- is a research network and aims to became a platform to exchange the information and knowledge, as well as to encourage people to become "" open -minded to understand"", through designs and creativities- we also encourage cooperation betwen government agencies, private sectors and non-government organizations, in order to encourage peace, safety, resilience and sustainability in Thailand and the world.





What We Need & What You Get
The money I need is 3000 dollars. 70% of this, I am going to donate to the NGO Design for Disaster.The remaining 30% I need to print my graphic novel. It will be printed in color will be 50 to 60 pages long, so it will be quite expensive to print. The money I'm spending here in Bangkok to be here and work on the project is my own savings, nobody is helping me, so all money I can get would be appreciated.

<span><span></span></span><b>What's the project about?</b><br/>
</h4><p>    Train of Thoughts is
a project by Crimzon studio. It will be an anthology of Graphic Novel stories
based on the famous Mumbai Local Trains, each story pen down by different
writers with their traveler’s experience from Mumbai in collaboration with artists
around the globe expressing their visual take on Mumbai Local Trains. We start
off with the first story “The Bridge” </p><p>
</p><h4><b>What's the first story about?</b></h4><p></p><p>“The Bridge” is a 25 page story which talks about the journey of four people in an
ordinary day-to-day ride, which millions take. In that simple mundane though,
something bizarre happens. That uncanny thing... is it the traveler’s thought or something else?!?</p><p>
</p><p><span>One of the Characters,<b> Hautechand</b>, does
 not want to step into
the trains, the reason is not on the concious level but lies in his 
sub-conscious. he is one who stands out in this crowd but he makes the 
crowd too just
like a drop of water makes the ocean. <br/></span></p><p><span><b>Kolmibai</b> is a drop in the ocean 
like
Hautechand, but her story and one journey of hers breaks the monotony of
 life and leads to a self-revelation.</span></p>
<p>Talking
 of self-revelations there is <b>Vibhuti</b> a timid and scared
girl who meets her strong inner being all because of a man who drives 
her to the edge. He pushes her to such an extent and threshold, where 
the only
place left, is for courage and self-confidence.</p>
<p>The stories of these people on the surface of it would seem
commonplace and as a traveler you too would feel the same but there is a
<b>BRIDGE</b> that takes us into the depths of our consciousness.</p>
<p></p><p>So
 what is that Bridge, is it a state of limbo, or the ways of the 
Heavens? Some Divine intervention? Or a way to Wisdom? Come travel with us
 in this Train of Thought which takes you to the <span>other side of the bridge and know what really transpires...</span></p><p>
</p><h4><b>Why have we chosen indigogo?</b></h4>
<p>    We have chosen Indigogo because it allows us as artists to
connect with the world and at the same time allows the world to connect with
our work. Train of Thoughts is about masses and we wish to present it to masses…

<p>Eisner
Award Nominee and multi Glyph Award winning artist N. Steven Harris and writer/creator
Robert Garrett are attempting to catapult their 2014 Glyph Award winning
property for Best Female Character, AJALA: A SERIES OF ADVENTURES, into the
realm of multi-media by initiating an <b>Indiegogo
campaign</b> to complete the first compelling arc of the young Harlem heroine.
Awareness has been growing over the past few months and with some promotional
and financial support, we will be able to complete issue #4 as well as create a
hard cover version of the collected 1-4 issues. These issues can also be
solicited to libraries and bookstores across the country. AJALA is a property
that addresses the comics’ diversity issue by having a well rounded, three
dimensional female character of color that operates in the context of family
and community as well as showcases a diverse supporting group of characters. We
are confident this will be worth your time.  </p>

ABOUT

Eisner
Award Nominee and multi Glyph Award winning artist N. Steven Harris and writer/creator
Robert Garrett are attempting to catapult their 2014 Glyph Award winning
property for Best Female Character, AJALA: A SERIES OF ADVENTURES, into the
realm of multi-media by initiating an Indiegogo
campaign to complete the first compelling arc of the young Harlem heroine.
Awareness has been growing over the past few months and with some promotional
and financial support, we will be able to complete issue #4 as well as create a
hard cover version of the collected 1-4 issues. These issues can also be
solicited to libraries and bookstores across the country. AJALA is a property
that addresses the comics’ diversity issue by having a well rounded, three
dimensional female character of color that operates in the context of family
and community as well as showcases a diverse supporting group of characters. We
are confident this will be worth your time.  



ABOUT AJALA
The series was Co-created and
written by Robert Garrett, founder of XMOOR STUDIOS, with beautiful
graphic support from Co-creator and illustrator N. Steven Harris.

The sci-fi coming of age story
revolves around 13-year-old AJALA STORM, a junior in high school who
lives in a mythical
neighborhood in Harlem, NY.  Focused upon
the Storms and their heroic family history that goes back generations when
their great Grandfather helped found a covert group known as the C.S.C. or
Community Spirit Center. The C.S.C. were made up of businessmen, teachers, and
community activists dedicated  to cleaning  up the streets of Harlem in the 1920’s.  AJALA: A SERIES OF
ADVENTURES is a comedy/drama/action comic, similar to female version of
James Bond who hasn’t quite grasped the role. 

AJALA is a larger than life
character with teenage ambition and angst. She’s a covert operative in training
to protect her community under the tutorage of a by-the-books operative who has
never broken a rule in his life. In the first issues, we look to establish what
this ultra secret group her family helped to start, The C.S.C. may have become
an uncontrollable entity. In these series of books we 
with
AJALA’s coming of age story with vast dynamics of a socially conscious society
and its history and of a legendary community fighting to keep its relevance.

<p>La campagna si è conclusa ed è stata un successo, davvero grazie mille a tutti quanti, sia a chi ha contribuito, sia a quanti ci hanno aiutati facendoci pubblicità, siete stati preziosi!</p>
<p>Nei prossimi giorni quanti hanno diritto alle commission verranno messi in contatto con Elisa per accordarsi sui soggetti e sui tempi di realizzazione (abbiate giusto un po' di pazienza perché tenete presente che le tavole della storia avranno la precedenza). Comunicheremo anche la data di uscita approssimativa della storia, che sarà inviata via mail in pdf a quanti ne hanno diritto con una settimana di anticipo. Insomma, dobbiamo farci due conti sulle varie tempistiche, ma vi terremo aggiornati.</p>
<p>E grazie ancora!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">CHE COS'È AGENZIA INCANTESIMI?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Agenzia Incantesimi è una serie a fumetti pubblicata gratuitamente sull'omonima <a href=""http://agenziaincantesimi.blogspot.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pagina</a>. Ne sono protagoniste Jasmine e Myriam, due ragazze che, grazie ai loro poteri magici (la prima è una potente maga, la seconda è figlia della regina del Popolo Fatato), indagano su tutti quei casi in cui sia coinvolta la magia.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Le nostre due protagoniste vivono infatti in un mondo in cui esiste la magia e tutta una serie di creature fantastiche come elfi, orchi, fate e altri ancora camminano tranquillamente in mezzo a noi. Un po' come se la Terra di Mezzo o Faerun fossero stati il nostro mondo durante il Medioevo, insomma.</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">LA TRAMA DI QUESTO EPISODIO IN BREVE</span><br/>
</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Alcune persone, uomini e donne, svaniscono senza lasciare altra traccia che una misteriosa pozza d'acqua. L'unico elemento che accomuna le varie persone scomparse è che tutte si erano sottoposte a interventi di chirurgia estetica presso la clinica del dottor Novak, che opera in una sperduta isoletta situata nel mare del Nord. Una clinica dove le costose operazioni avvengono rapidamente, implicano una degenza di appena un paio di giorni indipendentemente dall'entità dell'intervento e garantiscono risultati eccezionali. Ed proprio in quella clinica che si recano per indagare, sotto false identità, Myriam e Jasmine.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">DI COSA ABBIAMO BISOGNO</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nonostante la realizzazione della storia non dipenda da questa campagna, al momento Elisa sta lavorando gratuitamente. Lo sta facendo perché la storia la diverte e per mettersi alla prova su una sceneggiatura professionale, nonostante sia già bravissima. Come autore della serie io le sono davvero grato per questa sua disponibilità, ma mi piacerebbe poterle fornire una retribuzione, per quanto minima. Come forse alcuni di voi già sanno, la storia verrà pubblicata gratuitamente su Internet, sul sito di <a href=""http://agenziaincantesimi.blogspot.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Agenzia Incantesimi</a>, quindi non fornisce alcun introito che possa essere devoluto ai collaboratori. Perciò ho messo in piedi questa campagna (e altre la seguiranno per le altre storie): per compensare tangibilmente Elisa per il suo lavoro.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A CHE COSA SERVIRANNO I VOSTRI CONTRIBUTI</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Come ho già detto, per prima cosa i fondi raccolti verranno utilizzati come retribuzione per Elisa. Ma l'entità delle donazioni può anche influenzare la realizzazione delle prossime storie. Infatti contribuendo a questa campagna non solo mostrerete un tangibile apprezzamento per il lavoro di Elisa, ma incentiverete anche altri disegnatori a cimentarsi con le avventure di Myriam e Jasmine.

<p><b>Ciao, Elisa. Vogliamo cominciare col presentarti ai tuoi futuri lettori?</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify; background-color: initial;"">Ciao a tutti quanti! Sono Elisa Di Virgilio, classe 86, sono nata e vivo a Treviso - con tutta la tolleranza al prosecco e ai grappini che ne consegue.</span></p>
<p><b>Perché hai intrapreso questa strada? Chi o che cosa è stato a ispirarti?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Penso sia una domanda che si siano posti anche i miei, visto che, a differenza di molti disegnatori, io con la matita in mano ho seriamente cominciato a conviverci a 16 anni e non all'asilo! Il motivo penso sia stato il mio bisogno di evadere costantemente da una vita altrimenti troppo piatta. Fin da piccola, sia per dormire che per mangiare, avevo il bisogno vitale di sentirmi raccontare storie incredibili. Appena ho imparato a leggere mi sono arrangiata da sola, Infatti, divoravo libri su libri.
A 4 anni, poi, ho cominciato ad avere accesso al videoregistratore (che in quegli anni era anche un bene non da poco!) e iniziai a vedere film Disney. Tra quelli e i cartoni animati giapponesi, diciamo che la mia ""condanna"" era scritta.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">La vera svolta comunque è avvenuta alle superiori, quando lessi sul giornalino di istituto diversi fumetti fatti da una ragazza del mio liceo, Laura (che credo oggi faccia il medico, peraltro!) e, nel leggerli, ebbi un'epifania: i disegnatori bravi non erano solo geni o persone irraggiungibili, ma gente come me, potevo perfino parlarci! Sì, una vera e propria rivelazione. Grazie a Laura ho scoperto <b>Sky Doll, </b>perfetta unione fra quello che amavo della Disney e le storie non tutte rose e fiori dei manga, e con esso il tratto di Barbucci.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432671000/x0tkpav8lut3lbgfaano.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p><b>Che visione ha del mercato italiano (ma anche di quelli esteri, eventualmente), una giovane autrice che sta muovendo i primi passi al suo interno?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sinceramente, vedo il mercato italiano molto rigido, anche se negli ultimi tempi ci sono figure che stanno cercando di cambiarlo - penso a Roberto Recchioni e al suo lavoro su <b>Orfani, </b>ma non solo, anche a quanto sta cercando di creare al di fuori della Bonelli.
Uscita dalla Scuola di Comics, era chiaro che se avessi voluto lavorare in Italia avrei dovuto avere o un tratto realistico in bianco e nero, oppure un tratto disneyano incentrato su paperi e topi. Definisco il mio tratto ""euromanga"", quindi non sposandosi con nessuna di queste realtà devo guardare all'estero e incrociare le dita, o sperare che il mercato evolva ancora di più!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Credo anche che qui in Italia ci sia necessariamente bisogno di riportare i bambini e i ragazzi alla lettura di fumetti creati e pensati per loro, come avviene già in Francia. In Italia invece il percorso è questo: da piccolo leggi <b>Topolino</b>, poi appena arrivi agli 11 anni è il vuoto cosmico che viene riempito solo da fumetti americani e giapponesi, per tornare al fumetto italiano solo dai 25 anni in su. Perdiamo una grande fetta di pubblico ed è un gran peccato!</p>
<p><b>E qual è il tuo obiettivo principale, al momento? Un personaggio specifico a cui vorresti collaborare? Una tua creazione personale?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">L'obiettivo principale è di sicuro... Lavorare nel fumetto! Sarebbe già un gran passo avanti.
Se potessi scegliere, mi piacerebbe sia lavorare per la Francia con progetti miei o di altri, che poter lavorare all'interno di riviste per ragazzi (penso alla Red Whale o alla Disney).
Come dicevo prima, io mi nutro di storie, ma ne ho anche parecchie nel cassetto! Al momento ho diversi progetti personali su cui mettermi, uno tra questi è una fiaba nera a cui lavorerò quest'estate e che spero di poter mostrarvi a fine anno, incrociamo le dita!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Avere un propria pagina Facebook e condividere quel che si fa serve molto a farsi conoscere e apprezzare anche da chi non avrebbe mai occasione di sapere chi siamo e di venirci a cercare, ma bisogna sempre tenere a mente che un ""mi piace"" non porta soldi, purtroppo, anche se fa molto bene all'ego spesso tremolante di noi aspiranti fumettisti.
Internet è uno splendido mezzo di divulgazione, ma i veri lavori arrivano solo se si mandano i portfoli o se si fissano appuntamenti, e se non si smette di provare a cavare fuori pagine decenti!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Quali sono i tuoi strumenti di lavoro? Usi ancora carta e matita o disegni direttamente in digitale?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Io sono una vera frana col disegno digitale! Ammiro molto chi ci riesce, ma io ho bisogno di avere il foglio e la portamine accanto per mettere quantomeno le basi di quel che voglio disegnare (e per non farmi fuori gli occhi). Di recente sono riuscita a prendermi una Cintiq e sto così affrontando l'inchiostrazione digitale con meno ansie di quella manuale. Per il colore, invece, mi sono sempre affidata a Photoshop, dai tempi della versione 7. Mi piace comunque pasticciare con i copic e gli acquarelli quando mi prende l'estro.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mettermi alla prova con una sceneggiatura scritta da un professionista era sia una paura che un'opportunità per capire se ero in grado di lavorare con qualcuno che questo mestiere lo fa tutti i giorni. Quando ho letto l'annuncio mi sono fatta due conti e non era il caso di rimandare ancora la sfida. Quando rivedrò queste tavole fra appena un mese mi metterò le mani nei capelli, ma questa storia di <b>Agenzia Incantesimi</b> di sicuro rimarrà la mia prima vera palestra professionale, e di questo sono molto grata!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>E qual è il bilancio a questo punto della lavorazione?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Di mio adoro disegnare le donne - sarà che con i maschi li voglio perfetti e ogni volta ho difficoltà a mettere su carta il mio ideale personaggio maschile, ma ci sto lavorando - e soprattutto adoro i personaggi femminili forti e indipendenti, come lo sono Myriam e Jasmine, quindi mi sto divertendo molto!
Ci sono ovviamente difficoltà e limiti miei, ma sono felice di star disegnando personaggi e situazioni che normalmente non farei mai, è un grande sprono a migliorarsi e a superare le proprie paturnie.</p>

</div></div>","GRAZIE A TUTTI
La campagna si è conclusa ed è stata un successo, davvero grazie mille a tutti quanti, sia a chi ha contribuito, sia a quanti ci hanno aiutati facendoci pubblicità, siete stati preziosi!
Nei prossimi giorni quanti hanno diritto alle commission verranno messi in contatto con Elisa per accordarsi sui soggetti e sui tempi di realizzazione (abbiate giusto un po' di pazienza perché tenete presente che le tavole della storia avranno la precedenza). Comunicheremo anche la data di uscita approssimativa della storia, che sarà inviata via mail in pdf a quanti ne hanno diritto con una settimana di anticipo. Insomma, dobbiamo farci due conti sulle varie tempistiche, ma vi terremo aggiornati.
E grazie ancora!

CHE COS'È AGENZIA INCANTESIMI?
Agenzia Incantesimi è una serie a fumetti pubblicata gratuitamente sull'omonima pagina. Ne sono protagoniste Jasmine e Myriam, due ragazze che, grazie ai loro poteri magici (la prima è una potente maga, la seconda è figlia della regina del Popolo Fatato), indagano su tutti quei casi in cui sia coinvolta la magia.
Le nostre due protagoniste vivono infatti in un mondo in cui esiste la magia e tutta una serie di creature fantastiche come elfi, orchi, fate e altri ancora camminano tranquillamente in mezzo a noi. Un po' come se la Terra di Mezzo o Faerun fossero stati il nostro mondo durante il Medioevo, insomma.




LA TRAMA DI QUESTO EPISODIO IN BREVE
 Alcune persone, uomini e donne, svaniscono senza lasciare altra traccia che una misteriosa pozza d'acqua. L'unico elemento che accomuna le varie persone scomparse è che tutte si erano sottoposte a interventi di chirurgia estetica presso la clinica del dottor Novak, che opera in una sperduta isoletta situata nel mare del Nord. Una clinica dove le costose operazioni avvengono rapidamente, implicano una degenza di appena un paio di giorni indipendentemente dall'entità dell'intervento e garantiscono risultati eccezionali. Ed proprio in quella clinica che si recano per indagare, sotto false identità, Myriam e Jasmine.
""Bellezza Glaciale""(16 pagg. in b/n)  è un episodio di Agenzia Incantesimi scritto da Federico Memola e disegnato da Elisa Di Virgilio.


DI COSA ABBIAMO BISOGNO Nonostante la realizzazione della storia non dipenda da questa campagna, al momento Elisa sta lavorando gratuitamente. Lo sta facendo perché la storia la diverte e per mettersi alla prova su una sceneggiatura professionale, nonostante sia già bravissima. Come autore della serie io le sono davvero grato per questa sua disponibilità, ma mi piacerebbe poterle fornire una retribuzione, per quanto minima. Come forse alcuni di voi già sanno, la storia verrà pubblicata gratuitamente su Internet, sul sito di Agenzia Incantesimi, quindi non fornisce alcun introito che possa essere devoluto ai collaboratori. Perciò ho messo in piedi questa campagna (e altre la seguiranno per le altre storie): per compensare tangibilmente Elisa per il suo lavoro.


A CHE COSA SERVIRANNO I VOSTRI CONTRIBUTI Come ho già detto, per prima cosa i fondi raccolti verranno utilizzati come retribuzione per Elisa. Ma l'entità delle donazioni può anche influenzare la realizzazione delle prossime storie. Infatti contribuendo a questa campagna non solo mostrerete un tangibile apprezzamento per il lavoro di Elisa, ma incentiverete anche altri disegnatori a cimentarsi con le avventure di Myriam e Jasmine. Il vostro contributo, quindi, potrà aiutarci a produrre altre storie di Agenzia Incantesimi.
Noi porteremo avanti in ogni caso questo progetto, ma voi ora potete fare la differenza permettendoci di intensificare le ""uscite"" e avendo in cambio la possibilità di leggere un maggior numero di storie all'anno.








Poiché, a più di un mese dalla scadenza, abbiamo già quasi raggiunto il traguardo dei 500€ prefissati, Elisa e io abbiamo deciso di osare e offrirvi qualcosa di più nel caso si raggiungano due ulteriori traguardi. Eccoli qua di seguito.


TERZO TRAGUARDO: 1000€.
Sappiamo che si tratta di un'impresa titanica, ma se dovessimo riuscire davvero a raggiungere questo traguardo, la storia verrà interamente colorata.Non vi piacerebbe leggere una storia più lunga, più spettacolare e interamente a colori? Se la risposta è sì, aiutateci a soddisfarvi!




ALTRI MODI IN CUI POTETE AIUTARCI





Se non avete la possibilità di contribuire economicamente, magari potete aiutarci ugualmente segnalando sulle vostre pagine e ai vostri contatti questa campagna. Noi ve ne saremo comunque grati!





Ciao, Elisa. Vogliamo cominciare col presentarti ai tuoi futuri lettori?
Ciao a tutti quanti! Sono Elisa Di Virgilio, classe 86, sono nata e vivo a Treviso - con tutta la tolleranza al prosecco e ai grappini che ne consegue.
Perché hai intrapreso questa strada? Chi o che cosa è stato a ispirarti?
Penso sia una domanda che si siano posti anche i miei, visto che, a differenza di molti disegnatori, io con la matita in mano ho seriamente cominciato a conviverci a 16 anni e non all'asilo! Il motivo penso sia stato il mio bisogno di evadere costantemente da una vita altrimenti troppo piatta. Fin da piccola, sia per dormire che per mangiare, avevo il bisogno vitale di sentirmi raccontare storie incredibili. Appena ho imparato a leggere mi sono arrangiata da sola, Infatti, divoravo libri su libri.
A 4 anni, poi, ho cominciato ad avere accesso al videoregistratore (che in quegli anni era anche un bene non da poco!) e iniziai a vedere film Disney. Tra quelli e i cartoni animati giapponesi, diciamo che la mia ""condanna"" era scritta.
La vera svolta comunque è avvenuta alle superiori, quando lessi sul giornalino di istituto diversi fumetti fatti da una ragazza del mio liceo, Laura (che credo oggi faccia il medico, peraltro!) e, nel leggerli, ebbi un'epifania: i disegnatori bravi non erano solo geni o persone irraggiungibili, ma gente come me, potevo perfino parlarci! Sì, una vera e propria rivelazione. Grazie a Laura ho scoperto Sky Doll, perfetta unione fra quello che amavo della Disney e le storie non tutte rose e fiori dei manga, e con esso il tratto di Barbucci.




Che visione ha del mercato italiano (ma anche di quelli esteri, eventualmente), una giovane autrice che sta muovendo i primi passi al suo interno?
Sinceramente, vedo il mercato italiano molto rigido, anche se negli ultimi tempi ci sono figure che stanno cercando di cambiarlo - penso a Roberto Recchioni e al suo lavoro su Orfani, ma non solo, anche a quanto sta cercando di creare al di fuori della Bonelli.
Uscita dalla Scuola di Comics, era chiaro che se avessi voluto lavorare in Italia avrei dovuto avere o un tratto realistico in bianco e nero, oppure un tratto disneyano incentrato su paperi e topi. Definisco il mio tratto ""euromanga"", quindi non sposandosi con nessuna di queste realtà devo guardare all'estero e incrociare le dita, o sperare che il mercato evolva ancora di più!
Credo anche che qui in Italia ci sia necessariamente bisogno di riportare i bambini e i ragazzi alla lettura di fumetti creati e pensati per loro, come avviene già in Francia. In Italia invece il percorso è questo: da piccolo leggi Topolino, poi appena arrivi agli 11 anni è il vuoto cosmico che viene riempito solo da fumetti americani e giapponesi, per tornare al fumetto italiano solo dai 25 anni in su. Perdiamo una grande fetta di pubblico ed è un gran peccato!
E qual è il tuo obiettivo principale, al momento? Un personaggio specifico a cui vorresti collaborare? Una tua creazione personale?
L'obiettivo principale è di sicuro... Lavorare nel fumetto! Sarebbe già un gran passo avanti.
Se potessi scegliere, mi piacerebbe sia lavorare per la Francia con progetti miei o di altri, che poter lavorare all'interno di riviste per ragazzi (penso alla Red Whale o alla Disney).
Come dicevo prima, io mi nutro di storie, ma ne ho anche parecchie nel cassetto! Al momento ho diversi progetti personali su cui mettermi, uno tra questi è una fiaba nera a cui lavorerò quest'estate e che spero di poter mostrarvi a fine anno, incrociamo le dita!



Quanto credi che possa essere utile internet per affermarsi nel mondo del fumetto?
Avere un propria pagina Facebook e condividere quel che si fa serve molto a farsi conoscere e apprezzare anche da chi non avrebbe mai occasione di sapere chi siamo e di venirci a cercare, ma bisogna sempre tenere a mente che un ""mi piace"" non porta soldi, purtroppo, anche se fa molto bene all'ego spesso tremolante di noi aspiranti fumettisti.
Internet è uno splendido mezzo di divulgazione, ma i veri lavori arrivano solo se si mandano i portfoli o se si fissano appuntamenti, e se non si smette di provare a cavare fuori pagine decenti!
Quali sono i tuoi strumenti di lavoro? Usi ancora carta e matita o disegni direttamente in digitale?
Io sono una vera frana col disegno digitale! Ammiro molto chi ci riesce, ma io ho bisogno di avere il foglio e la portamine accanto per mettere quantomeno le basi di quel che voglio disegnare (e per non farmi fuori gli occhi). Di recente sono riuscita a prendermi una Cintiq e sto così affrontando l'inchiostrazione digitale con meno ansie di quella manuale. Per il colore, invece, mi sono sempre affidata a Photoshop, dai tempi della versione 7. Mi piace comunque pasticciare con i copic e gli acquarelli quando mi prende l'estro.



Venendo a noi, che cosa ti ha spinto a proporti per una storia di Agenzia Incantesimi?
Mettermi alla prova con una sceneggiatura scritta da un professionista era sia una paura che un'opportunità per capire se ero in grado di lavorare con qualcuno che questo mestiere lo fa tutti i giorni. Quando ho letto l'annuncio mi sono fatta due conti e non era il caso di rimandare ancora la sfida. Quando rivedrò queste tavole fra appena un mese mi metterò le mani nei capelli, ma questa storia di Agenzia Incantesimi di sicuro rimarrà la mia prima vera palestra professionale, e di questo sono molto grata!
E qual è il bilancio a questo punto della lavorazione?
Di mio adoro disegnare le donne - sarà che con i maschi li voglio perfetti e ogni volta ho difficoltà a mettere su carta il mio ideale personaggio maschile, ma ci sto lavorando - e soprattutto adoro i personaggi femminili forti e indipendenti, come lo sono Myriam e Jasmine, quindi mi sto divertendo molto!
Ci sono ovviamente difficoltà e limiti miei, ma sono felice di star disegnando personaggi e situazioni che normalmente non farei mai, è un grande sprono a migliorarsi e a superare le proprie paturnie.



Quale pensi che sia il maggior pregio di questa serie? E quale il principale difetto?
Credo che la forza di Agenzia Incantesimi stia soprattutto nelle sue protagoniste, agli antipodi come carattere ma che formano una bella coppia d'azione. Anche il genere di storie che consente di spaziare dal fantasy al poliziesco, fino allo sci-fi e al weird, permette a tutti di trovare una storia che possa colpirli e appassionarli.
Di contro c'è che, personalmente parlando, soffro un po' della mancanza di una trama generale, di un filo conduttore che porti le protagoniste a un punto preciso, a una svolta. In fondo vedo tutti gli episodi di Agenzia Incantesimi quasi come fossero puntate di un telefilm, e la presenza di un fil rouge, nel mio caso renderebbe il tutto più avvincente. 
E' un problema dovuto alla natura produttiva della serie: non si può inserire una continuity quando non si sa se e quando verranno pronti i singoli episodi. Invece cosa vorresti dire a chi sta finanziando la realizzazione della storia?
Innanzitutto grazie della fiducia che mi state dando, visto e considerato che sto muovendo i primissimi passi nel mondo del fumetto. Farò del mio meglio per darvi un prodotto che meriti la vostra attenzione e che spero vi faccia divertire almeno un po'!
Per finire... Myriam o Jasmine?
Ehh... Io ho un grande debole per Jasmine, senza nulla togliere a Myriam, che adoro disegnare (vi lascio immaginare perché)!",18.0,0,"6 Campaigns

*Bigfoot Bill 2 end-sheets by Alejandro Mirabal!
Bigfoot Bill is so much more than just a comic. I've been world-building for over 25 years in video games, comics and animation and I want to take you on a journey! Your favorite cryptozoological characters are here; The Mothman, Skunk Ape, Loch Ness Monster, Jersey Devil, Doppelganger and even a few Greek gods thrown in for fun! Thank YOU for helping me tell this story! It's important to me and if you read it I intend to make it important to you.

Above is the new cover design for the first book Bigfoot Bill: Shadow of the Mothman. In this new edition, I upgraded the end-sheets with Alejandro Mirabal art as you can see below:
NEW! Two-page spread end-sheets!
But there's more! I put together some new story pages to help smooth out the first Bigfoot Bill story. These new pages have colors by Gabe Eltaeb and they are sprinkled throughout the first book. I've made a few edits to the book that better lead to where the story of book 2 ends up:
And don't forget that I've also taken this back-story of Poseidon from The Making Of and added it to the new edition of Bigfoot Bill: Shadow of the Mothman:

The Impact
With over 9,000 backers in my last campaign, we unleashed the crowd in crowd-funding. By contributing, you directly improve the quality of the book for every other backer. The more backers come in to donate, the bigger and better the books, goodies and shipping materials get!Every Backer will be given a tracking number tied to their order. These help to help know when your package is on its way so you can always know where it is in the shipping process.
This is my 6th crowd-funding campaign and while I'm still learning and improving on every aspect of production, you can be sure that even at the lowest backer tier, you will get something wonderful in the mail!I'm only in competition with myself, and my sole goal on every campaign is to make the book better than the one before. Together, we can make another book that shakes up your comic collection!
Support My Other Story... it's a supernatural thriller!
