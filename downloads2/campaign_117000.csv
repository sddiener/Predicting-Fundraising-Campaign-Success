Seit Jahren habe ich kein Buch gelesen, dem ich so tief und durchgehend zustimme und von dem ich so intensiv das Gefühl habe, dass dies Botschaften sind, die die Welt hören muss. Die Klarheit, Einfachheit und existenzielle Wichtigkeit dieses Buches stehen außer Frage. Ich bitte alle, es zu lesen, und andere zu ermutigen, dasselbe zu tun.“ Prof. Simon Anholt Gründer von „Good Country“, Good Country Index und Global Vote „Die Simpol-Lösung“ ist ein ermutigender, weil umsetzungsorientierter und pragmatischer erster Schritt in Richtung einer Weltordnungs-Plattform. Eine voll funktionierende Global Governance ist vermutlich noch sehr viel weiter entfernt, doch die Simpol-Lösung beinhaltet Handlungsschritte, die unternommen werden können und in vielen Fällen bereits unternommen wurden, um ein wachsendes Netzwerk aus international abgestimmten und vereinheitlichten Rahmenvereinbarungen zu entwickeln. Damit ist die Simpol Lösung etwas, das wahre Kosmopoliten, frustriert über die derzeitige Unerreichbarkeit einer voll funktionalen Weltregierung, heute bereits vorantreiben können, um so zumindest die wichtigsten ihrer Träume und Visionen zu realisieren. Das ist das Beste, was wir derzeit haben, das Ähnlichkeiten mit einem echten und funktionalen Welt-Regierungssystem aufweißt."" - <i><strong>Ken Wilber, Bewusstseinstheoretiker, Autor von „Die Integrale Vision“ </strong></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545906416/txd9y2hjde0t8gro2mhe.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> „Ein mutiges und dringend benötigtes Buch.

Aber haben Sie jemals darüber nachgedacht, dass Regierungen nicht auf diese Probleme reagieren wollen, sondern dass sie dies nicht können? Ihr Bedürfnis, ihre Volkswirtschaften für internationales Kapital und Investoren attraktiv zu halten, macht es ihnen unmöglich, die Gesellschaft oder die Umwelt in den Vordergrund zu stellen. Was wäre, wenn Sie helfen könnten, Regierungen vom Wettbewerb um Kapital zu befreien, damit sie für unsere Zukunft zusammenarbeiten können? Was wäre, wenn Sie Teil einer Bewegung sein könnten, die es uns ermöglicht, unsere Stimmen auf völlig neue Weise zu nutzen, um die Regierungen zur Zusammenarbeit zu bewegen?SIMPOL heißt: Nicht zu versuchen, ein Problem zu Zeit zu lösen, sondern gemeinsam mehrere Probleme gleichzeitig angehen, dass sich daraus keine Nachteile für irgendein Land ergeben.The SIMPOL-Solution ist eines dieser seltenen Bücher, die nicht nur die Ursachen für unsere derzeitige Unfähigkeit, globale Probleme zu lösen, beschreiben, sondern gleichzeitig auch konkrete Lösungen und neue Wege anbieten. Die SIMPOL-Kampagne existiert bereits! Helfen Sie uns, nicht nur dieses Buch auf deutsch zu veröffentlichen, sondern eine bessere Zukunft zu ermöglichen. Es liegt in unserer Hand!  Hier können wir tatsächlich etwas bewirken!Hier ein paar wichtige Links:

 DIE AUTOREN John Bunzl ist Direktor eines internationalen Textilunternehmens, Schriftsteller und internationaler Vorkämpfer mit einer einfachen und starken Vision für wirksamere globale Zusammenarbeit. Seit über einem Jahrzehnt hat er mit politischen Entscheidungsträgern und Politikern, Wissenschaftlern und Nichtregierungsorganisationen, Aktivisten und Bürgern auf der ganzen Welt zusammengearbeitet, um eine effektivere Zusammenarbeit zu fördern. Im Jahr 2000 gründete John die International Simultaneous Policy Organization (ISPO) und startete die Simultaneous Policy (Simpol) Kampagne. John schreibt regelmäßig Beiträge für die Huffington Post und hat auf verschiedenen TEDx-Veranstaltungen gesprochen. Er hat SIMPOL auch dem Weltsozialforum, der Welthandelsorganisation, der Schumacher Society und verschiedenen Universitäten einschließlich der London School of Economics vorgestellt.Nick Duffell ist ein Psychotherapeut, Trainer und Psychohistoriker mit langjähriger Erfahrung als Moderator in der Führungsentwicklung. Er hat mehrere Bücher veröffentlicht. Sein The Making of Them (2000) fand breite Anerkennung, und sein 2004 erschienenes Buch Wounded Leaders, das eine herausfordernde psychologische Analyse der britischen politischen Szene liefert, schlägt immer noch Wellen. Nick und seine Frau Helena gründeten 1996 das Center for Gender Psychology und verfassten gemeinsam das beliebte Buch Sex, Love und Dangers of Intimacy. Stimmen zum Buch „Es ist ambitioniert und provokativ. Kann es funktionieren? Das ist sicherlich einen ernsten Versuch wert“.  - Noam Chomsky „Ich musste zustimmen und nicken, bis mir der Nacken wehtat. Seit Jahren habe ich kein Buch gelesen, dem ich so tief und durchgehend zustimme und von dem ich so intensiv das Gefühl habe, dass dies Botschaften sind, die die Welt hören muss. Die Klarheit, Einfachheit und existenzielle Wichtigkeit dieses Buches stehen außer Frage. Ich bitte alle, es zu lesen, und andere zu ermutigen, dasselbe zu tun.“ Prof. Simon Anholt Gründer von „Good Country“, Good Country Index und Global Vote „Die Simpol-Lösung“ ist ein ermutigender, weil umsetzungsorientierter und pragmatischer erster Schritt in Richtung einer Weltordnungs-Plattform. Eine voll funktionierende Global Governance ist vermutlich noch sehr viel weiter entfernt, doch die Simpol-Lösung beinhaltet Handlungsschritte, die unternommen werden können und in vielen Fällen bereits unternommen wurden, um ein wachsendes Netzwerk aus international abgestimmten und vereinheitlichten Rahmenvereinbarungen zu entwickeln. Damit ist die Simpol Lösung etwas, das wahre Kosmopoliten, frustriert über die derzeitige Unerreichbarkeit einer voll funktionalen Weltregierung, heute bereits vorantreiben können, um so zumindest die wichtigsten ihrer Träume und Visionen zu realisieren. Das ist das Beste, was wir derzeit haben, das Ähnlichkeiten mit einem echten und funktionalen Welt-Regierungssystem aufweißt."" - Ken Wilber, Bewusstseinstheoretiker, Autor von „Die Integrale Vision“  „Ein mutiges und dringend benötigtes Buch. Es lenkt den Blick auf den Kern des Problems: ‚Wir können die Probleme der Welt nicht mit dem gleichen Denken lösen, das sie hervorgebracht hat‘. Das hat Einstein gesagt, und Bunzl und Duffell weisen den Weg, das umzusetzen.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Under Clouds and City Lights</i> is an illustrated poetry collection about the beautiful feelings, moments, and things that end and begin over and over again and make up our lives.<br/><br/>My name is Caitlin Ju and I am the author of <i>Under Clouds and City Lights</i>. I wrote this book because I feel that we don’t spend nearly enough time just feeling and sitting in our thoughts. Writing this book allowed me to sit in those thoughts, and it was my self-care, therapy, and joy starting two months into the pandemic and for the next few months that followed. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover there are many small things and experiences that tie us together. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to give yourself the time and space to process even the most mundane experiences and emotions, negative or positive, alongside my own journey and memories. This book is for you to turn to so that you can reflect and feel, no matter where you are in your life. <br/><br/>In this book, you’ll join me in exploring love, mental health, loss, friendships, and family and discovering the firsts, emotions, trials, little things, and lasts in life through poems like: <ul>
<li>“Honey and Glass” — a poem about the beginning of a journey on self-love and self-confidence.</li>
<li>“Friends or Strangers” — a poem about a “last” and feeling of loss when you realize a friend has become a stranger again.</li>
<li>“As Seen on TV” — a poem about finally seeing someone who looks like you on the screen, a look into when I saw Crazy Rich Asians and finally saw Asian American representation.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you have ever felt like you couldn’t open up, if you are going through some of your most difficult times or will soon, and if you want to find hope by looking into your toughest and happiest experiences. <br/><br/><i>Under Clouds and City Lights</i> speaks to those who want to grapple with memories and emotions in a new way. Ultimately, I hope that my book inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>What are your most important firsts and lasts?</li>
<li>How do we know when we have lost someone? What if we still remember them?</li>
<li>What are the little things that we hold onto? </li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing our relationships, thoughts, and moments of pain, doubt, resilience, and everything in between, will change us all for the better. <br/> <h2>The Book - Under Clouds and City Lights</h2>The book is written in 5 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the author’s note + section 1: beginnings. This is for the first time we ever laughed, dreamed, met someone, doubted, and loved and for all our beginnings.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains section 2: thought clouds. This is for all the feelings that have entered our minds as thought clouds and all the times we have felt lonely, chaotic, undeserving, powerful, free, and vulnerable.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains section 3: trials. This is for all the most pivotal and difficult times in our lives and for when we have felt hopeless, lost, overlooked, empowered, and loved, sometimes all at once.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains section 4: little things. This is for all the little things that make life and us special. The thing may be very small, like chopsticks, very large, like space, or something that belongs to the world, like clouds.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5</strong> contains section 5: endings. This is for all the lasts and endings that we will ever experience, whether it is the end of the night, last time we see someone, or the end of our youth.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.</p>
<p>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</p>
<p>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</p>
<p>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this April 2021.</p>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

<h3>Story of my book </h3>
<i>Mercy</i> is a fantasy adventure novel following a young witch on her path to understanding her magic and who she is as a person. Mercy has grown up hiding and ignoring her magical powers. After accidentally injuring her father when she loses control of her magic, Mercy sets off in search of another witch capable of teaching her to use her power. Her journey leads her into new territories that help her forge bonds, experience life, and accept who and what she is. <br/><br/>My name is Maxine Smith and I am the author of <i>Mercy</i>. I wrote this book because as a new adult I am learning to be my own person and make my own choices. I'm interested in exploring the transitional periods between stages of life and created Mercy and her journey to delve into the emotional changes and repercussions that come with growing up, branching out, and making decisions.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how your past and history can affect you, but will never control you. There are always choices you can make to change your future and your fate. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to explore growth and change as you escape from everyday life into this fantasy adventure and learn alongside Mercy, Ka'Soran, and Repeat about the importance of discovering yourself and claiming independence.<br/><br/><i>Mercy</i> is set in the Greenlands, a magical continent home to elves, giants, goblins, dwarves, and many other magical races. During Mercy’s search for a teacher, she meets Ka’Soran, a young human scholar on his way to apprentice in the capital city of Rendum. Upon arrival, the two fast friends go their separate ways, but fate has different plans for them both. Launched into an evil plot and forced to pick sides, Mercy, Ka’Soran, and a mysterious vagabond from the Bandit Wood set off to, hopefully, save their world as they know it. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy fantasy, adventure, fantasy worlds and creatures, and magic.<br/><br/><i>Mercy</i> speaks to fantasy lovers and young people who want to grapple with history and adulthood in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Mercy</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How do the choices you make reflect on the person you are?</li>
<li>Can we choose to change our futures? Is it our minds that limit us?</li>
<li>What is a family? Is it blood that makes family? </li>
<li>How can history appear in our present-day lives?</li>

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hope for Health: A New Wave of the Healthcare Experience explores the healthcare industry and the ways that politics, service, technology, and new practices can change healthcare and play into our everyday lives. I wrote this book because healthcare has always fascinated me and I wanted to learn more about this complex industry and share that knowledge with others. My book will publish in February 2020.</span></p>
<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>Hope for Health: A New Way of the Healthcare Experience A book about the ways that the many, ever changing, aspects of healthcare play into the patient experience.<br/><br/>My name is Jacob Schupp and I am the author of Hope for Health: A New Wave of the Healthcare Experience. We are all impacted by healthcare in some way, shape, or form. Millions of people are impacted by the healthcare industry (directly or indirectly) every day. I wrote this book because I have always been interested in healthcare. So many people are impacted by this industry daily and yet so many people know so little about it. One aspect of healthcare that I am specifically drawn to is the patient experience and looking to see the ways that we can better improve this lifesaving system that impacts so many people.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the ways that so many people play a role in patient care, directly or indirectly. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for healthcare in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand the healthcare industry, become an advocate for yourself or a loved one, and possibly enter the healthcare industry.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about healthcare and the many complex intersections:<p>Spiritual Care - and how it can help so many people through some of their toughest moments</p>
<p>Healthcare Innovation - and how these changes can help move the industry further</p>
<p>Service - and how this mindset shift can help everyone involved</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are impacted by or curious about the healthcare system.<br/>Hope for Health: A New Wave of the Healthcare Experience is a non-fiction book that speaks to those impacted by the healthcare system and want to know more about this complex industry that impacts all of us who may be looking at health care for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>The Book - Hope for Health: A New Wave of the Healthcare Experience</strong></p>
<p>The book is written in 7 Parts<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters. In this section I will introduce the book and learn of the enormous potential there is for the healthcare system.<br/><br/>Part 2 is a look at healthcare through the eyes of the purchaser.

Story of My BookHope for Health: A New Way of the Healthcare Experience A book about the ways that the many, ever changing, aspects of healthcare play into the patient experience.My name is Jacob Schupp and I am the author of Hope for Health: A New Wave of the Healthcare Experience. We are all impacted by healthcare in some way, shape, or form. Millions of people are impacted by the healthcare industry (directly or indirectly) every day. I wrote this book because I have always been interested in healthcare. So many people are impacted by this industry daily and yet so many people know so little about it.

In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for healthcare in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand the healthcare industry, become an advocate for yourself or a loved one, and possibly enter the healthcare industry.In this book, you'll learn about healthcare and the many complex intersections:Spiritual Care - and how it can help so many people through some of their toughest moments

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am trying to support a poor mission school in a slum in Nairobi, Kenya with the sale of my book, ""The Wedding Gift.""  I was 40 years old and happily planning a Catholic wedding when my mother (Pauline Hofmann) was given terrible news about her health in her fight against cancer.  Not in a million years would I have thought that the events that transpired in the months before my wedding would have ever happened to me.  The week before my wedding was the most difficult in my life.  This is a mother/daughter memoir and<strong> proceeds from the sale of this book will be put into mother's education fund that supports a poor mission school in a slum in Nairobi, Kenya, Kariobangi region.<br/></strong></p>
<p>                                                 **********</p>
<p>I wrote most of the book in the year after my mothers death and my wedding.  My fiance and I both lived in Cincinnati, Ohio at the time and I was running a small personal fitness training and consulting business.  I sat down at the computer after her death, really just to record some memories of her, of our enlightening conversations and to never forget the shocking events and twists of fate that surrounded her failing health and passing.  However, something took over me while at the keyboard and I was flooded with words and ideas and suddenly a book took shape.  I could never stop typing.  Little did I know that this book writing adventure would be the most therapeautic action I could have taken to help me deal with my mothers death and all the major changes that occurred in my life at that time. </p>
<h3><strong>Three Main Goals</strong></h3>
<p>1. To save lives and educate the poorest of the poor children in a slum in Nairobi, Kenya, Kariobangi region.  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>2. To keep my mothers spirit of volunteerism alive and thriving in Kenya.</p>
<p>3. To help those who are struggling with the loss of a loved one.</p>
<p>After my mothers death an education fund was set up in her honor, as a missionary, by a Catholic priest.  This fund supports the mission school in the Kariobangi slum outside of Nairobi, Kenya.  <strong></strong>These kids in the school go without, food, water, clothing, shoes and school supplies on a daily basis.  Their only meal in a day may only come from the school.  Many children have lost parents to AIDS and some at young ages have to support and care for even younger brothers and sisters.  These children are struggling and hurting and they view the school as a life saving institution.</p>
<p>Throughout my mothers life, she financially supported many kids in that mission school on their quest for a better life with education.  Some have even gone on to get degrees in higher education.  I want this to continue.  I am passionate about it...I want to do this in honor of my mother and for all those little boys and girls in school in Kenya that just want to live and go to school and get educated.  They value education and know how important it is in enriching a life and changing a country. </p>
<p>It would be a dream come true to be able to raise at least $2700 for this project.  <strong></strong>I hope to have the book published by Dec. 15, 2012 if not before then.</p>
<p><strong><em>Find out how you can impact a childs life now, see perks at right.</em></strong></p>

<div>
<h3>How The Money Will Be Spent</h3>
<p>1.  $1500.00 is the exact amount that needs to be paid to a small hybrid book publisher that has agreed to get the book in print and marketed within their system.</p>
<p>2.  An additional $1200.00 will be used in the following ways:</p>
<p>     a.) To purchase extra copies of the book.</p>
<p>     b.) To ship some copies to the African Mission School in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p>     c.) To pay a web designer to help get it on-line for purchase on a website separate  from the publisher.</p>
<p>     d.) To design and buy marketing materials to send to specific booksellers in the U.S.</p>
<p>     e.) To buy a nice Giving Tree plaque in honor of my mothers work to be placed in the mission school in Nairobi.</p>
<p>A portion of the funds raised will go directly into the Pauline Hofmann Education Fund.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: This is a fixed funding campaign, if we do not reach our goal of $2700 your money will be refunded.</strong></em> </p>

<h3>About The Book</h3>
<p>The book is written, has been edited and is now ready to go to a publisher.  I worked with two editors at different times in this process and both strongly recommended that I get it published.  I remember clearly the advice given from each one, ""Quite impressive for a first timer, you can do it, keep working on it,"" and, ""Of all the books that I have read and edited, this is the only one that I have ever cried reading.""  Some say this is the next Brian's Song.</p>
<p>It is 142 pages long, with 23 chapters.  I am the sole author of the book, written in a conversational style.  It is an easy read, Catholic in nature and tone. </p>

<p>2. A published Poet at the University of Cincinnati saw the first rough draft and said, ""Good stuff here, this could be the start of something great.""</p>
<p>3. A writer/actor in Columbus responded with, ""Your book is so lovely.""</p>
<p>4. A personal training client of mine said, ""I cried my eyes out reading it, it was so touching.""</p>
<h3>About the Education Fund</h3>
<p>The Pauline Hofmann Education Fund (PHEF) was set up by a Comboni missionary priest who benefited directly from the financial support over many years from my mother and father.  This order of priests, nuns and lay people work tirelessly in mostly African nations.  The Comboni Missionaries North American Province is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.  <strong>My mother volunteered at this mission center for almost 30 years, up until she lost her battle with breast cancer at the age of 70.</strong>  My father still makes a weekly visit to the center to work for a day, he is now 83 years old.  To learn more about the Comboni Missionaries, visit their website at <a href=""http://www.combonimissionaries.org."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.combonimissionaries.org.</a>   Monthly withdraws are made out of this fund for the school in Nairobi.</p>
<h3>The Mission School</h3>
<p>Located in the downtrodden Kariobangi neighborhood outside of Nairobi, Kenya, the Comboni mission school serves 247 children between the ages of seven and 15.  It is estimated that 20,000 children live there in the entire community.  Many of these children are HIV positive or have AIDS and many are faced with unimagineable poverty in the filthy slums of Nairobi.  Nairobi is one of the largest cities in Africa. Quote from Frather Paulino who runs the parish and school, ""HIV/AIDS has been so disastrous in our parish that no one can count the number of orphans. I am trying to feed, dress and put these children back in school, this is a nightmare.""</p>
<p><strong><em>Impact the life of a poor child today, view perks at right to see how.</em></strong></p>
<h3>Speaking Opportunities</h3>
<p>I have been asked on a few occasions to share my story and speak to local groups on grief and how to handle challenges and stresses in life.  This is of great interest to me, and I would love to be able to share the book and help others who may be struggling with the loss of a loved one. </p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>See perks at right. It doesn't take much to make a big impact in Africa.  Here is your opportunity to instill hope and help a child feel love.  $100 pays for one child to attend the mission school for a year.  This is a fixed funding campaign so you must donate using PayPal.  You do not have to have an account with PayPal in order to contribute.  <strong></strong> Don't worry, its secure, quick and easy.  Unfortunately, your donations are not tax deductible because I am not a non-profit 501 (c) (3) organization.  <strong>Any donation over $50.00 will get your name listed in the acknowledgement section of my book.</strong></p>

About the Education Fund
The Pauline Hofmann Education Fund (PHEF) was set up by a Comboni missionary priest who benefited directly from the financial support over many years from my mother and father.  This order of priests, nuns and lay people work tirelessly in mostly African nations.  The Comboni Missionaries North American Province is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.  My mother volunteered at this mission center for almost 30 years, up until she lost her battle with breast cancer at the age of 70.  My father still makes a weekly visit to the center to work for a day, he is now 83 years old.  To learn more about the Comboni Missionaries, visit their website at www.combonimissionaries.org.   Monthly withdraws are made out of this fund for the school in Nairobi.
The Mission School
Located in the downtrodden Kariobangi neighborhood outside of Nairobi, Kenya, the Comboni mission school serves 247 children between the ages of seven and 15.  It is estimated that 20,000 children live there in the entire community.  Many of these children are HIV positive or have AIDS and many are faced with unimagineable poverty in the filthy slums of Nairobi.  Nairobi is one of the largest cities in Africa. Quote from Frather Paulino who runs the parish and school, ""HIV/AIDS has been so disastrous in our parish that no one can count the number of orphans. I am trying to feed, dress and put these children back in school, this is a nightmare.""
Impact the life of a poor child today, view perks at right to see how.
Speaking Opportunities
I have been asked on a few occasions to share my story and speak to local groups on grief and how to handle challenges and stresses in life.  This is of great interest to me, and I would love to be able to share the book and help others who may be struggling with the loss of a loved one. 
How You Can Help
See perks at right. It doesn't take much to make a big impact in Africa.  Here is your opportunity to instill hope and help a child feel love.  $100 pays for one child to attend the mission school for a year.  This is a fixed funding campaign so you must donate using PayPal.  You do not have to have an account with PayPal in order to contribute.   Don't worry, its secure, quick and easy.  Unfortunately, your donations are not tax deductible because I am not a non-profit 501 (c) (3) organization.  Any donation over $50.00 will get your name listed in the acknowledgement section of my book.

</div></div>","The Story Thus Far
Hi there. My name's Andy
and I love films and writing. I am on a quest to make my 2011 a Fantastic year.
But I need YOUR help. 
The Deal
First, we need to
time-travel to the long, long ago of 2010. This is when I first started my
blog, rockets and robots are GO! I love films and writing, and I combine those
two passions here, where I write about every film I see in the cinema, among
other things. The challenge I see for myself is to continually push and improve
on what I do. So it’s time to step up my game. It’s time to break out the f
words: Fantastic Fest. 
Fantastic Fest is held
every year at the Alamo Drafthouse Theatre. It is the film festival for the weird, genre, esoteric and just plain fantastic. These are films you might not
get a chance to see anywhere else, or they might be films that get that crucial
leg-up from Fantastic Fest. Not only that, but there are events during the week
long Fest that sound too crazy not to miss. Sure there's Cannes, Sundance and many, many other film festivals. But Fantastic Fest is the one film festival in the world I have dreamed of attending. 
The thing is, the Fest is
held in Austin, Texas and I... I am in Wellington, New Zealand. 
What I Need & What You GetTo get to Fantastic Fest I
need the following: 


Festival
pass ($205 USD)


Return
airfare ($2,800 NZD, roughly $2,000 USD)


Accommodation
(running just over $1,000 USD for the Fest)

Like I said, I write about
every film I see in a cinema. That includes festival screenings (at last year’s
NZ International Film Festival I was able to schedule 47 films in 2 weeks. I
wrote up every single one. And around my day job too). At Fantastic Fest I plan
on cramming in as many crazy great films and events as I can and I will be
writing up every single experience. My goal
is to make it feel like you, the reader, are there with me having the time of your life. I may very well
break my brain doing it, but do it I must. 
It may help if you look at
it like this: I’m a writer being sent on assignment. But instead of being paid
by a newspaper, magazine or website I am “paid” directly by my (lovely,
intelligent and awesome) readers. Though this isn’t technically accurate as I
won’t be making a dime off this, I plan to really make you a part of this adventure. Do not mistake this for a holiday! I will be busting my ass to bring you, the reader, the best coverage possible from this amazing one-of-a-kind film festival. 
It’ll be part review, part
travelogue and all adventure! 
The Impact
If you can help me with
this, you’ll be helping to fulfil a big dream. If I don’t reach this funding goal
of mine, that’s ok. I’ll know I tried and that I had great people supporting
me. 
BUT! If I do make it, if I
do achieve this... well, you'll have helped me achieve a dream of mine. This could be the start of something truly awesome; for me, for my writing, for my life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The name Argosy has a long history. The first magazine to go by that name was founded here in Britain in 1865. The more famous American version followed in 1882 under the stewardship of the pioneering Frank Munsey. With this revival of the concept, we want to go back to the Argosy’s roots.</p>
<p>Frank Munsey is known as the inventor of the “pulp magazine”. He used the most advanced printing technologies of his time to produce a low-cost short story magazine on uncut “pulp” paper. He followed this up by building an empire on various affordable magazines, and others soon borrowed his technique. A revolution in short fiction began.</p>
<p>Short stories are a wonderful, meaningful art form. In taking up the Argosy banner, we aim to continue Frank Munsey’s industrial heritage to pioneer a revival of the pulp short story. We can’t claim to have invented the e-book as Frank Munsey invented the low-cost pulp magazine, but we can follow his example and use e-book technology to distribute our short story collections in the most economical way possible. E-books allow for quicker editing and typesetting, and modern technology allows us to accept submissions from authors all around the world and distribute to readers everywhere, and to keep volumes available indefinitely where dead tree edition magazines are restricted to their printing schedules.</p>
<p>We may be repeating history, but doesn't mean we'll limit ourselves to mere imitation. We want to be the pioneers of a new pulp revolution, as Munsey was all those years ago.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>With this project, we want to reward you with more than just kind words and tacky merchandise, so each reward beyond the first will come with a copy of Argosy, with the higher rewards offering you subscriptions at a significant discount, physical copies of the first volume and even a professional review of your short story, which could land it in the pages of Argosy itself.</p>
<p>The perks we've made available have been perfectly crafted to give you the greatest freedom of choice, so you can decide whether you want a limited edition print copy of Volume 1: Fantastic Frontiers, the first two digital volumes, a years subscription, a professional review of your short story by the Argosy team, or any combination of those perks. It's completely up to you.</p>
<p>The money raised from this project will go towards completing our first volume, Fantastic Frontiers--rewarding our current writers and attracting a few more to contribute the last few stories in the collection. Most of the work is already complete and we already have some fantastic stories from some brilliant authors, and with your help we can get Volume 1 published by the end of the month by getting even more writers involved to finish off what is already going to be a superb collection. Already we have an amazing cover piece by the award winning artist Tais Teng, and if we raise enough we'd like to pay to do some illustrations too.</p>
<p>Your contributions will also pave the way for future volumes by drawing in talented writers and artist. As a stretch goal, we want each story to have a personalized illustration. But even if we don't reach our goal, those funds raised will still go towards advances for future writers and cover artists.</p>
<p>Most of the work for our first collection is already complete, and we've already begun collecting works for our future volumes. Following the Frank Munsey principle of low production costs and high quality products, we're able to reduce the risks associated with the printing industry to practically zero. Using digital formats, there will be no risk of returns, and by using the crowdfunding model we can ensure that all the funding we need to produce that product is there right from the start.<br/></p>

<p>This “woman” dropped me off with some people who were of the same treacherous tribe. I became a missing persons. I ended up with hundreds of other kids and young adults cattled in some warehouse. They approached these men one by one. Every time they would access the flesh and scream NEXT!! A young blonde girl walks up who looks like some child from the back of those milk cartoons. He looks at her, pushes her toward the next level of Dante’s Hell and screams NEXT! Another girl walks up, barely speaks English. Looks like one of those pretty Mexican girls from some small village. Like most of the other girls in the warehouse, she can’t understand him. All I care is that you understand what you must do, he tells her. He pushes her off. NEXT, Another young girl. This time he doesn’t say NEXT. He motions to 2 other men and says: “Teach her a Lesson”.  For the next 5 hours all we heard were her screams. Oh God, I am NEXT! I stood in front of him not knowing what kind of plans were in store. We stayed in this warehouse for God know how long. They gave us little food and allowed little talk. I would hear torturous screams and sob. I was put in isolation . They were in the process of breaking us into sex slaves. One day a truck came for a bunch of us. They took us to the place that represented death- the desert. We were told to wear the negligee provided so training could start. Someone knocked at the door and I find myself shivering in 117 degree weather. This man walks in and I clocked him as he came into the room. Little did I know that my trafficker was behind him. Let’s just say that I know why those little girls in the warehouse shrieked now. When I woke up from that nightmare, I found myself in a darker nightmare. I was being raped by several men. All I heard was NEXT. Whose next? My soul was being raped out of my body. NEXT! This continued for hours. It was a wicked dance of beasts cannibalizing my body. NEXT! What kind of sick men get hard-ons from a carcass! Do you understand? I was just flesh lying there. NEXT? When I heard the last NEXT, nobody was there. I lifted my sore body off of the table and looked at the broken mirror across from me. NEXT, I heard again. Nothing. This time I uttered NEXT and in the reflection in front of me, I saw a vaporous image that would not be clear again for some years to come . . .</p>

If you do, stop right where you are and take a gander into my soul with the words I've scrawled onto the pages of my new book. If you're looking to get a taste of my poetry, <b>check out the samples in the gallery</b>!</p><p>I'm Aster Lune and I've brought to life the words inside my heart, into a collection to share with the world. I am publishing this collection of poetry, through LuLu.com but wanted to allow pre-orders for those who are as excited as I am. However, they do not have a system yet that you can set up for pre-orders! So I asked myself, how can I make that available if my independent publisher does not offer it? Indiegogo came to mind! So here we are. The official release date for <i>Collecting Stardust</i> is May 23, 2014. Here, you can pick a from a few contribution options for your pre-order! <b>(Note: $2000 is not necessarily the goal, I do not expect to necessarily reach, nor exceed that.)</b></p><p><b><i>Important note:</i> </b>I have requested to <b>receive the funds by May 31st</b>, which means the <b>deadline to contribute and pre-order is May 12th</b>. As soon as I receive the funds, I will be ordering them and then sending them all out signed and ready to go with each perk, as soon as they arrive at my house! So I can't guarantee a set date you will receive them. But if you send me your email address, and what your perk was, then as soon as I sent out your order I will send you tracking information! (to get in contact with me please email me here: <a href=""mailto:asterlunewrites@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>asterlunewrites@gmail.com</b></a>) <b>Also: If you ordered one of the Starchunk perks, please please PLEASE let me know which one; because I forgot to label them separately to be able to differentiate who ordered which one! If I haven't heard from you by the end of the campaign, I will shoot you an email and ask you, so that way I don't send you the wrong order!</b></p><p><i>(On a <b>final note</b>, because I couldn't do it without these two people in particular: a huge thank you for the support and encouragement my best friend Brenden gave to me before he died. Finally a really big thank you to Heather from <a href=""http://bit.ly/1nBEY5o"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Little Ram Editing &amp; Consulting</a> for helping me through all of this! Couldn't do it without you two. You're the best! Check out Little Ram!)</i></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>All pre-ordered books come hand-signed. I want to make notice that those who pre-order will not necessarily receive them quickly (because of the way the funds in this is set up and so it depends on how quickly I receive it from Indiegogo). Because of that though, I want to try and offer you the best deals.</p><p>The <b>first perk</b> is not a book. This perk was designed for those of you who may not necessarily want the book or can't afford the book yet, but want to help contribute to my ability to do two things: provide cheaper (signed) books to those who pre-order (and the shipping cost to send it to them/you), as well as order a bulk amount of books to be able to bring around to local shops and bookstores. <b>This first perk is a $5 poster card of a poem (of mine) of your choice.</b></p><p>The<b> second perk</b> is early release of the e-book <i>Collecting Stardust.</i> <b>$10 will get you the e-book May 16, a week before the official release date.</b></p><p>The <b>third perk</b> is simply a hand signed copy of the paperback of <i>Collecting Stardust</i>. <b>$15 will cover the book, signature, and shipping.</b></p><p>The <b>fourth perk</b> is a fun one. Since our release date is <i>Lucky Penny Day</i>, we wanted to incorporate some lucky pennies! <b>For $20 I will personally handcraft bookmarks with lucky pennies attached, to include with your purchase of a hand-signed copy.</b></p><p>The <b>fifth perk</b> is for those who like to maximize their reading and sharing. If you would rather not have a bookmark, for <b>$20 you could instead receive a hand signed paperback copy and for this limited time only, a copy of the e-book as well.</b> For those of you who would like to have both the paperback and the e-book, this is the only time you will not have to pay full price for both!</p><p>The <b>sixth and last perk</b> jumps up significantly in price. This is split up into three separate prices (so it looks like 3 perks but it's all the same perk). <b>For $50, $75, or $100, you receive all of the previous perks: a poster card poem of your choice, hand signed paperback copy, a bookmark, and an e-book.</b> The bulk of this perk is to help support underlying costs for manufacturing, Indiegogo fees (they take a chunk out), shipping, editing, and design-- as well as future projects. <b>An added bonus for this perk is: locals to the Humboldt County area (and possibly surrounding areas, depending on distance) can meet with and have lunch/brunch with me. People who are not local, can instead have a fun Skype session or hand written letter sent to them. In either situation, (lunch or skype/letter), I will let you in on a few secrets on upcoming news and projects!</b> <i>(And whatever funds are left from this project, gets split into being shoved away into a savings account for my kid, and for future projects)</i></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Writing is a wonderful way to express emotion, and is a great form of therapy. I've learned, through my own experience and hearing from others, that often times reading other's writing, inspires you to write or find ways to express yourself. Especially when you have read something that resonates deep within your heart and you relate to so strongly. My goal is for you, or someone you love, to read my writing and find something that resonates with you and inspires you to express yourself. When you feel a connection to someone's writing, you feel a connection to the writer; and you no longer feel alone. If you are going through a rough break up, dealing with the struggles of unrequited love or maybe a long distance relationship, or maybe feeling just completely depressed for reasons no one but you know; whatever it is, you're not alone. Through the hardest times, you can find comfort in writing and reading. If you're not a big reader, novels may not be for you. So perhaps you can find solace in the company of beautiful, powerful short pages filled with imagery and love, description and emotion. Poems vary in length, but are (generally) much shorter than novels or even novellas. You don't have to finish chapters, you just have to read a page or two and then you can come back later. You can skip around. They each tell their own story-- and so if novels aren't for you, maybe this is. I hope that this, and any future projects of mine, are able to reach a part of you that maybe you didn't realize was there; or didn't realize others experienced as well.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>It's a tough economy to live in right now. Being a young mom and student and only working part time, I understand that. Money is hard to come by, and these days everything costs money. So if you're not able to contribute even if you wanna, I completely understand! You can still help me out by spreading the word and sharing this with your friends. Even if they don't pre-order anything, they might know someone who wants to! The more people who see it, the more people it get's around to! I just want the word out. Thank you everyone for all your help and support!</p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryDo you, or someone that you know, enjoy poetry?

This is split up into three separate prices (so it looks like 3 perks but it's all the same perk). For $50, $75, or $100, you receive all of the previous perks: a poster card poem of your choice, hand signed paperback copy, a bookmark, and an e-book. The bulk of this perk is to help support underlying costs for manufacturing, Indiegogo fees (they take a chunk out), shipping, editing, and design-- as well as future projects. An added bonus for this perk is: locals to the Humboldt County area (and possibly surrounding areas, depending on distance) can meet with and have lunch/brunch with me. People who are not local, can instead have a fun Skype session or hand written letter sent to them. In either situation, (lunch or skype/letter), I will let you in on a few secrets on upcoming news and projects! (And whatever funds are left from this project, gets split into being shoved away into a savings account for my kid, and for future projects)The ImpactWriting is a wonderful way to express emotion, and is a great form of therapy. I've learned, through my own experience and hearing from others, that often times reading other's writing, inspires you to write or find ways to express yourself. Especially when you have read something that resonates deep within your heart and you relate to so strongly. My goal is for you, or someone you love, to read my writing and find something that resonates with you and inspires you to express yourself. When you feel a connection to someone's writing, you feel a connection to the writer; and you no longer feel alone. If you are going through a rough break up, dealing with the struggles of unrequited love or maybe a long distance relationship, or maybe feeling just completely depressed for reasons no one but you know; whatever it is, you're not alone. Through the hardest times, you can find comfort in writing and reading. If you're not a big reader, novels may not be for you. So perhaps you can find solace in the company of beautiful, powerful short pages filled with imagery and love, description and emotion. Poems vary in length, but are (generally) much shorter than novels or even novellas. You don't have to finish chapters, you just have to read a page or two and then you can come back later. You can skip around. They each tell their own story-- and so if novels aren't for you, maybe this is. I hope that this, and any future projects of mine, are able to reach a part of you that maybe you didn't realize was there; or didn't realize others experienced as well.Other Ways You Can HelpIt's a tough economy to live in right now. Being a young mom and student and only working part time, I understand that. Money is hard to come by, and these days everything costs money. So if you're not able to contribute even if you wanna, I completely understand! You can still help me out by spreading the word and sharing this with your friends. Even if they don't pre-order anything, they might know someone who wants to! The more people who see it, the more people it get's around to! I just want the word out. Thank you everyone for all your help and support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>February 22, 2018 - Soooooo, about those stretch goals!</strong></p>
<p>The Vulture Culture 101 IndieGoGo Campaign started a little over two weeks ago, and as of right this moment it’s at $2,723, which is 91% of the original $3,000 I asked for--THANK YOU!!!! Since you all have been so enthusiastic in supporting this, it’s only right that I put a couple of stretch goals out there:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519331767/j8ej2ihcmbq4qygbxhbb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>--<strong>If the campaign reaches $4,000, I will have stickers of the above skull design printed!</strong> Everyone who will pledged at a level that includes physical items being sent to them up to that $4,000 mark will have a sticker tucked into their package at no extra cost. After we hit $4,000 I will open up additional perk levels where you can get the sticker (with or without the paperback book).</p>
<p>--<strong>If the campaign reaches $6,000, I will also produce a set of animal skull flash cards to help you with learning to identify some of the skulls you may encounter in Vulture Culture.</strong> Right now I’m looking at somewhere around 36-ish cards for the deck. If we reach the $6,000 mark, the deck will be automatically added at no extra charge to ALL pledges at the $100 Vulture Starter Kit level, the $250 Deluxe Vulture Starter Kit level, and the $500 Ultimate Vulture level. Additionally, I will add pledge levels where you can buy the paperback book and a set of flash cards.</p>
<p>Please note that I may have to push back order fulfillment a bit for orders with flash cards as it will take me extra time to design and print the cards.</p>
<h3>At Last, A Book on Vulture Culture!</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Lupa! I am an artist, author, and naturalist in the Pacific Northwest. I've been working with hides and bones in my artwork and spirituality since 1998, and my first book on nature-based spirituality was published in 2004. Among my publications are <i>Skin Spirits: The Spiritual and Magical Use of Animal Parts</i> (Megalithica Books, 2010) and <i>Skull Scrying: Animal Skulls in Divinatory Trance</i> (self-published, 2015). I am also the creator of <i>The Tarot of Bones</i> deck and book set, which was funded through two wildly successful IndieGoGO campaigns in <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-tarot-of-bones/x/9997962#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2015</a> and <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-tarot-of-bones-2016-campaign-cards/x/9997962#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2016</a>, and was <a href=""http://www.thetarotofbones.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">officially released in 2017</a>. I maintain a <a href=""http://www.thegreenwolf.com/animal-parts-laws"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">database of animal parts laws that is used by thousands of people every year</a>, and I have run multiple events combining <a href=""http://www.curiousgallerypdx.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">art and natural history</a> (and <a href=""http://www.stilldeath.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">skulls</a>!)</p>
<p>Now I am turning my creative endeavors toward a new book project focusing on the ""fandom"" that has arisen around the collection and appreciation of hides, bones and other animal remains. <i>Vulture Culture 101: A Book For People Who Like Dead Things</i> is the first book solely focused on this subculture. While there are books out there concerning taxidermy, or animal bones, or hide tanning, Vulture Culture covers these topics and so much more! There will be information on how to find other Vultures, legalities and ethics, where to find specimens, and even how to get the smell of roadkill off your hands. Here's a working table of contents from the official website, <a href=""http://www.vultureculture101.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vultureculture101.com</a>:</p>
<p>Introduction<br/>Chapter 1: Roots and Revival: Historical and Modern-Day Vultures<br/>Chapter 2: The Successful Scavenger: Where Do I Get My Goods?<br/>Chapter 3: Identifying Hides, Bones and More<br/>Chapter 4: Here’s Where It Gets Messy: Processing Raw Specimens<br/>Chapter 5: Put Your Best (Rabbit’s) Foot Forward: Displaying and Caring For Your Collection<br/>Chapter 6: Vultures and Our Neighbors<br/>Chapter 7: Rewilding the Beast: Vulture Culture as a Return to Nature<br/>Conclusion<br/>Appendix I: Further Resources<br/>Appendix II: Recommended Nature-based Nonprofits</p>
<p>As of this campaign, I have written over 90% of the final manuscript, minus the guest essays (which I'll talk about in a minute!) I have a few more topics I want to cover here and there, but the bulk of the writing is done. My goal is to release the book in Summer of 2018, and you can help make that happen by backing this campaign on IndieGoGo!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where's the Money Going?</h3>
<p>Every dollar of the $3000 goal of this campaign will go directly into funding the production of <i>Vulture Culture 101</i>. Here's what I need to cover:</p>
<p><strong>--Writers! </strong>I'll be using some of the funds to pay guest writers for how-to essays on topics like tanning and bone cleaning, since I'm more of a hide and bone artist than a hide and bone processor. (Look for a call for writers out on my social media once the IGG campaign is complete.)</p>
<p><strong>--Books! </strong>As with The Tarot of Bones Companion Book, I'll be self-publishing and using CreateSpace as a platform. I'll need to print enough books to cover IndieGoGo backers, plus some more for general sales stock.</p>
<p><strong>--Perks!</strong> While these are awesome extras for you, I still have to pay for their printing/materials/etc. and spend time putting together the handmade ones. </p>
<p><strong>--Shipping!</strong> Shipping costs will be factored in during your pledge process, but keep in mind I'll also need to pay to have the books shipped to me from the printer.</p>
<p>While the majority of costs will go to the production of the book, I will be donating a to-be-decided portion of the proceeds to nonprofit organizations that benefit wildlife and their habitats, such as the <a href=""http://www.xerces.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation</a> and <a href=""http://www.nature.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Nature Conservancy</a>. I am already a regular contributor to several of these organizations, including making monthly donations to some. While the exact amount I give varies from month to month depending on my income and expenses, I do what I can to help these organizations keep up their good work. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>About Those Perks...</h3>
<p>So what sorts of goodies can you get by backing this campaign? Here are a few possibilities for you to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Vulture Culture 101 </i>(of course!) - you'll be able to get a single copy, or two at a time (one for you, one for a friend!)</li>
<li>The Tarot of Bones, and other books I've written - you can have your choice of some or all of my previous, currently in print publications.</li>
<li>A Wearable Fox Tail - tails are one of my most popular handmade items; each one is made from a tail left over from garment manufacture, and each has a handmade attachment using secondhand leather from old jackets rather than a cheap ball chain or keychain.</li>
<li>Vulture Culture Starter Kits - featuring a nifty assortment of specimens; the actual contents of your kit will be a surprise, but expect goodies like fur, bones and more</li>
<li>Furs of North America Wall Hanging - this is a very limited perk, featuring a leather wall hanging with samples of several furs from North American mammals. (Note that some furs may be replaced with substitutes if they are not legal in your state.)</li>
<li>A wearable red fox, coyote or wolf headdress made from a whole hide complete with head, tail, paws and claws</li>
<li>A special thank you in the book and on the official website (you can opt out of one or both of these)</li>
<li>And more! Check the list of perks on the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can't decide which one you reallllly want, keep in mind you can claim multiple perks by making multiple contributions--<a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526766-How-do-I-claim-a-Perk-#Can-I-claim-multiple-perks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more information here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Also, please remember that perk amounts include my costs for materials for fulfilling them, and also remember that IndieGoGo and Paypal will both take out part of the money for their fees!</strong></p>
<p>(My apologies to non-US folks; due to customs restrictions I cannot ship anything made with wildlife parts outside of the US. Books are totally legal to ship worldwide, however!)</p>
<p>Now for a little more detail on some of these perks:</p>
<p><strong>Books and Tarot</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515368842/fuyvudy4vsnxuaaacvnz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I've written and published several books prior to this project. You can choose to bring home one or more of these titles, shipped along with your copy of <i>Vulture Culture 101</i> in Summer 2018:</p>

<p>Please note that my anthologies are not included in this special offer. </p>
<p>If you want just the Vulture Culture related titles, the Vulture Culture Book Lot includes <i>Vulture Culture 101</i>, <i>Skin Spirits: The Spiritual and Magical Use of Animal Parts</i>, <i>Skull Scrying: Animal Skulls in Divinatory Trance</i>, and <i>The Tarot of Bones</i> deck and book. If you just want <i>Vulture Culture 101</i> and <i>The Tarot of Bones</i>, select the VC101 and Tarot of Bones package.</p>
<p><strong>Tails and Ears</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515369170/prpjlrsg6b5caa13ygfa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>(Photo is a sample; exact items you get may vary.)</p>
<p>Tails and ears are among my most popular handmade creations, and I've sold thousands of both over the years. You can just get a fox tail with your copy of Vulture Culture 101, or select the Add a Tail and Ears, Please package to get a matched set of either coyote or red fox wearable ears and tail.</p>
<p><strong>Vulture Culture Starter Kits</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515369308/mrdogn501pgtut7hvstz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>(Photo is a sample; exact items you get may vary.)</p>
<p>Want some dead things to go with your copy of Vulture Culture 101? Check out the Vulture Starter Kit and Deluxe VC Starter Kit perks! The exact contents of your kit are a surprise, but expect a nice variety of hide, bone and other nifty specimens. The Vulture Starter kit will have a good all-around basic collection; the Deluxe amps it up in both quality and quantity. Please note that state laws will determine what I can and can't include in your kit.</p>
<p><strong>Furs of North America Wall Hanging</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515369614/sqyzoo20f60jtqmf5tcr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I made one of these several years ago, but it was stolen at a show before I was even able to put it on display. Now it's back as a special limited perk for this IndieGoGo campaign! A lovely piece of deerskin creates a backing for a variety of real fur samples from legal North American mammals. Please note that the wall hanging you receive will be larger and include more species (some species may not be available in your state due to legalities.) What you see here is just a small sampler to give you an idea of the concept.</p>
<p><strong>Headdresses</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515370863/ezyoabtfw1nnhz6hplwq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I've been making full hide headdresses for over 15 years. Rather than using non-biodegradable taxidermy supplies, I create a lighter, more open style of headdress that can be worn for long periods of time comfortably. If you'd like a headdress to go with your copy of <i>Vulture Culture 101</i>, I have perk options for red fox, coyote, and wolf--check them out! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, I have run two very successful IndieGoGo campaigns for <i>The Tarot of Bones</i>, both of which greatly exceeded their goals. 2015's campaign asked for $5,000 and made $10,143, and 2016's asked for $5,000 and made $5,800. Because this is a less elaborate project, consisting of a book rather than a deck and book, and requiring fewer raw materials for production, my overhead is lower. However, given that I was able to fund that much more expensive project, I am confident in my ability to successfully fund and release <i>Vulture Culture 101</i>. </p>
<p>This is a flexible-funding campaign, which means that if I do not meet my goal, I still get the money (but IndieGoGo gets to keep a much larger percentage of it, 9% as opposed to 4%, not including Paypal's fees on top of that). Even if I don't raise $3,000, I will continue with the project with the goal of having the book released Summer 2018; the successful completion of this campaign will make that much easier. </p>
<p><strong>While the IndieGoGo campaign is not my sole source of funding for this project</strong>, it will allow me to divert a lot less money from my everyday income and help me compensate for the time that I spent working on <i>Vulture Culture 101</i>. In short, by backing this campaign you'll be helping me keep my bills paid and my belly full while I dedicate myself to this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Is This Project Important?</h3>
<p>There are plenty of resources on Vulture Culture online, and there are books on how to do taxidermy, or how to identify skulls. However, they are scattered across libraries and the internet. <i>Vulture Culture 101</i>, while it will not be a completely exhaustive book on the subject (such a thing would be impossible!), is meant to be a well-rounded book on both Vulture Culture and the natural history specimens we enjoy. It gives readers both a good foundation in what Vulture Culture is, and how to get involved, from processing specimens to finding other Vultures.</p>
<p>It's also meant to be a book that you can hand to curious (but perhaps confused) friends and family who want to know more about why you're so interested in dead stuff. And it's a great read for people who just like unusual topics in their nonfiction perusals. </p>
<p>But it's not just about us. It's also about how Vulture Culture is seated in the greater context of the natural world. We humans have an imperfect relationship with the rest of nature, all too often exploitative and acquisitive rather than balanced. So <i>Vulture Culture 101 </i>also challenges readers to examine their ethics, and to consider the impact of our interests. And it invites everyone to connect their natural history collection back to nature itself, and the responsibility we have to our ecological community. </p>
<p>Do you want to see this book happen? Even if you can't back the campaign, <strong>please help spread the word</strong>! Use the share tools that IndieGoGo provides. Post a link on Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter and elsewhere. Email people you think would be interested. Contact alternative, art and other media sources who may be interested in covering what I'm working on here (I have a press release available if you need it!) <strong>The more people who know about this campaign, the merrier--and the more we can share Vulture Culture with the world!</strong></p>

</div></div>","February 22, 2018 - Soooooo, about those stretch goals!
The Vulture Culture 101 IndieGoGo Campaign started a little over two weeks ago, and as of right this moment it’s at $2,723, which is 91% of the original $3,000 I asked for--THANK YOU!!!! Since you all have been so enthusiastic in supporting this, it’s only right that I put a couple of stretch goals out there:

--If the campaign reaches $4,000, I will have stickers of the above skull design printed! Everyone who will pledged at a level that includes physical items being sent to them up to that $4,000 mark will have a sticker tucked into their package at no extra cost. After we hit $4,000 I will open up additional perk levels where you can get the sticker (with or without the paperback book).
--If the campaign reaches $6,000, I will also produce a set of animal skull flash cards to help you with learning to identify some of the skulls you may encounter in Vulture Culture. Right now I’m looking at somewhere around 36-ish cards for the deck. If we reach the $6,000 mark, the deck will be automatically added at no extra charge to ALL pledges at the $100 Vulture Starter Kit level, the $250 Deluxe Vulture Starter Kit level, and the $500 Ultimate Vulture level. Additionally, I will add pledge levels where you can buy the paperback book and a set of flash cards.
Please note that I may have to push back order fulfillment a bit for orders with flash cards as it will take me extra time to design and print the cards.
At Last, A Book on Vulture Culture!
Hi, I'm Lupa! I am an artist, author, and naturalist in the Pacific Northwest. I've been working with hides and bones in my artwork and spirituality since 1998, and my first book on nature-based spirituality was published in 2004. Among my publications are Skin Spirits: The Spiritual and Magical Use of Animal Parts (Megalithica Books, 2010) and Skull Scrying: Animal Skulls in Divinatory Trance (self-published, 2015). I am also the creator of The Tarot of Bones deck and book set, which was funded through two wildly successful IndieGoGO campaigns in 2015 and 2016, and was officially released in 2017. I maintain a database of animal parts laws that is used by thousands of people every year, and I have run multiple events combining art and natural history (and skulls!)
Now I am turning my creative endeavors toward a new book project focusing on the ""fandom"" that has arisen around the collection and appreciation of hides, bones and other animal remains. Vulture Culture 101: A Book For People Who Like Dead Things is the first book solely focused on this subculture. While there are books out there concerning taxidermy, or animal bones, or hide tanning, Vulture Culture covers these topics and so much more! There will be information on how to find other Vultures, legalities and ethics, where to find specimens, and even how to get the smell of roadkill off your hands. Here's a working table of contents from the official website, http://www.vultureculture101.com:
IntroductionChapter 1: Roots and Revival: Historical and Modern-Day VulturesChapter 2: The Successful Scavenger: Where Do I Get My Goods?Chapter 3: Identifying Hides, Bones and MoreChapter 4: Here’s Where It Gets Messy: Processing Raw SpecimensChapter 5: Put Your Best (Rabbit’s) Foot Forward: Displaying and Caring For Your CollectionChapter 6: Vultures and Our NeighborsChapter 7: Rewilding the Beast: Vulture Culture as a Return to NatureConclusionAppendix I: Further ResourcesAppendix II: Recommended Nature-based Nonprofits
As of this campaign, I have written over 90% of the final manuscript, minus the guest essays (which I'll talk about in a minute!) I have a few more topics I want to cover here and there, but the bulk of the writing is done. My goal is to release the book in Summer of 2018, and you can help make that happen by backing this campaign on IndieGoGo!

Where's the Money Going?
Every dollar of the $3000 goal of this campaign will go directly into funding the production of Vulture Culture 101. Here's what I need to cover:
--Writers! I'll be using some of the funds to pay guest writers for how-to essays on topics like tanning and bone cleaning, since I'm more of a hide and bone artist than a hide and bone processor. (Look for a call for writers out on my social media once the IGG campaign is complete.)
--Books! As with The Tarot of Bones Companion Book, I'll be self-publishing and using CreateSpace as a platform. I'll need to print enough books to cover IndieGoGo backers, plus some more for general sales stock.
--Perks! While these are awesome extras for you, I still have to pay for their printing/materials/etc. and spend time putting together the handmade ones. 
--Shipping! Shipping costs will be factored in during your pledge process, but keep in mind I'll also need to pay to have the books shipped to me from the printer.
While the majority of costs will go to the production of the book, I will be donating a to-be-decided portion of the proceeds to nonprofit organizations that benefit wildlife and their habitats, such as the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation and the Nature Conservancy. I am already a regular contributor to several of these organizations, including making monthly donations to some. While the exact amount I give varies from month to month depending on my income and expenses, I do what I can to help these organizations keep up their good work. 

About Those Perks...
So what sorts of goodies can you get by backing this campaign? Here are a few possibilities for you to choose from:


Vulture Culture 101 (of course!) - you'll be able to get a single copy, or two at a time (one for you, one for a friend!)
The Tarot of Bones, and other books I've written - you can have your choice of some or all of my previous, currently in print publications.
A Wearable Fox Tail - tails are one of my most popular handmade items; each one is made from a tail left over from garment manufacture, and each has a handmade attachment using secondhand leather from old jackets rather than a cheap ball chain or keychain.
Vulture Culture Starter Kits - featuring a nifty assortment of specimens; the actual contents of your kit will be a surprise, but expect goodies like fur, bones and more
Furs of North America Wall Hanging - this is a very limited perk, featuring a leather wall hanging with samples of several furs from North American mammals. (Note that some furs may be replaced with substitutes if they are not legal in your state.)
A wearable red fox, coyote or wolf headdress made from a whole hide complete with head, tail, paws and claws
A special thank you in the book and on the official website (you can opt out of one or both of these)
And more! Check the list of perks on the right.

If you can't decide which one you reallllly want, keep in mind you can claim multiple perks by making multiple contributions--more information here. 
Also, please remember that perk amounts include my costs for materials for fulfilling them, and also remember that IndieGoGo and Paypal will both take out part of the money for their fees!
(My apologies to non-US folks; due to customs restrictions I cannot ship anything made with wildlife parts outside of the US. Books are totally legal to ship worldwide, however!)
Now for a little more detail on some of these perks:
Books and Tarot

I've written and published several books prior to this project. You can choose to bring home one or more of these titles, shipped along with your copy of Vulture Culture 101 in Summer 2018:
Fang and Fur, Blood and Bone: A Primal Guide to Animal Magic
DIY Totemism: Your Personal Guide to Animal Totems
Skin Spirits: The Spiritual and Magical Uses of Animal Parts
New Paths to Animal Totems: Three Alternative Approaches to Creating Your Own Totemism
Plant and Fungus Totems: Connect With Spirits of Field, Forest and Garden
Nature Spirituality From the Ground Up: Connect With Totems in Your Bioregion
Please note that my anthologies are not included in this special offer. 
If you want just the Vulture Culture related titles, the Vulture Culture Book Lot includes Vulture Culture 101, Skin Spirits: The Spiritual and Magical Use of Animal Parts, Skull Scrying: Animal Skulls in Divinatory Trance, and The Tarot of Bones deck and book. If you just want Vulture Culture 101 and The Tarot of Bones, select the VC101 and Tarot of Bones package.
Tails and Ears

(Photo is a sample; exact items you get may vary.)
Tails and ears are among my most popular handmade creations, and I've sold thousands of both over the years. You can just get a fox tail with your copy of Vulture Culture 101, or select the Add a Tail and Ears, Please package to get a matched set of either coyote or red fox wearable ears and tail.
Vulture Culture Starter Kits

(Photo is a sample; exact items you get may vary.)
Want some dead things to go with your copy of Vulture Culture 101? Check out the Vulture Starter Kit and Deluxe VC Starter Kit perks! The exact contents of your kit are a surprise, but expect a nice variety of hide, bone and other nifty specimens. The Vulture Starter kit will have a good all-around basic collection; the Deluxe amps it up in both quality and quantity. Please note that state laws will determine what I can and can't include in your kit.
Furs of North America Wall Hanging

I made one of these several years ago, but it was stolen at a show before I was even able to put it on display. Now it's back as a special limited perk for this IndieGoGo campaign! A lovely piece of deerskin creates a backing for a variety of real fur samples from legal North American mammals. Please note that the wall hanging you receive will be larger and include more species (some species may not be available in your state due to legalities.) What you see here is just a small sampler to give you an idea of the concept.
Headdresses

I've been making full hide headdresses for over 15 years. Rather than using non-biodegradable taxidermy supplies, I create a lighter, more open style of headdress that can be worn for long periods of time comfortably. If you'd like a headdress to go with your copy of Vulture Culture 101, I have perk options for red fox, coyote, and wolf--check them out! 

Risks & Challenges
As I mentioned above, I have run two very successful IndieGoGo campaigns for The Tarot of Bones, both of which greatly exceeded their goals. 2015's campaign asked for $5,000 and made $10,143, and 2016's asked for $5,000 and made $5,800.

</h3><h3>Short Summary  (French description below)</h3><p>I am Angelique Papadelias, the managing director of Little Screen Big Screen. I am from Sydney Australia and for the last few years, I have been residing in New York and Quebec, Canada. </p><p></p>
<p>I have spent the last few
months with one incredibly determined woman (Line Chaloux) from Quebec and Ten refugee families from
Africa, Bhutan/ Nepal, Kosovo and Colombia. During this time, these families
trusted me to capture their life stories about what happened, where they came
from and how they got here now. This has been a rare opportunity because many
people know that refugees risk their lives telling details of their history. These stories expose the truth about what is happening on the ground
level to these local people, and their stories take us on a journey through
their home towns, the torture they experienced from the brutal militiamen and their
displacement to another country. It really highlights the depth of their faith
to survive all they have endured. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/592687/files/20140520130005-7R1A6586.jpg?1400616005"" src="""" style=""width: 558px; height: 372px;""/></p>(Pictured: Angelique with Lachuman and his family  from Bhutan / Nepal)<p><br/></p><p>Excerpt from the book - Lachuman: </p><p></p>
<blockquote>"" <i>At times when the rain and winds came, the water would drip
inside the hut and soak our beds. We couldn’t sleep as everything was
saturated. When the wind blew the plastic off our roof we couldn’t go to school
the next day due to not having had sufficient sleep. Times were tough on everybody
and once the rain stopped, we had to dry our beds. They would give us more
bamboo, another plastic sheet and my brothers would help my father construct
another shelter. This process took 2-3 days.</i>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<i>The hospital in the camp was very basic and there was a
constant lack of doctors and a scarcity of food and water. The UN would
transport food trucks to the camp and distribute food such as rice, oil,
onions, pumpkin, chilli, lentils and bananas. It was up to us to buy meat and
other vegetables with the little money we could get from small jobs. We could
not leave the camp to get other food so whatever we were given, we accepted.
When the water ran out, we would have no water to cook rice so we could not eat
sufficiently and had poor nutrition, which led to a lack of concentration at
school and hunger pains.  Years later,
the UN started to provide us with breakfast at the school which was cooked in a
small kitchen and could be best described as ‘wheat powder’ porridge. Life at
the time was like that of a camel living in the dessert without food but
carrying water on its back to survive…. and at many times, without the water.<span><br/></span><br/></i><i>My father needed to earn some money for us so he became a
‘pastor’ in the camp. We were of the Hindu faith. He would walk to peoples’
homes, reading and praying with them and they would give him a small amount of
money for his services.  That money was
used for our food.""</i>
</blockquote>

<p></p></div>","Short Summary  (French description below)I am Angelique Papadelias, the managing director of Little Screen Big Screen. I am from Sydney Australia and for the last few years, I have been residing in New York and Quebec, Canada. 
I have spent the last few
months with one incredibly determined woman (Line Chaloux) from Quebec and Ten refugee families from
Africa, Bhutan/ Nepal, Kosovo and Colombia. During this time, these families
trusted me to capture their life stories about what happened, where they came
from and how they got here now. This has been a rare opportunity because many
people know that refugees risk their lives telling details of their history. These stories expose the truth about what is happening on the ground
level to these local people, and their stories take us on a journey through
their home towns, the torture they experienced from the brutal militiamen and their
displacement to another country. It really highlights the depth of their faith
to survive all they have endured. (Pictured: Angelique with Lachuman and his family  from Bhutan / Nepal)Excerpt from the book - Lachuman: 
"" At times when the rain and winds came, the water would drip
inside the hut and soak our beds. We couldn’t sleep as everything was
saturated. When the wind blew the plastic off our roof we couldn’t go to school
the next day due to not having had sufficient sleep. Times were tough on everybody
and once the rain stopped, we had to dry our beds. They would give us more
bamboo, another plastic sheet and my brothers would help my father construct
another shelter. This process took 2-3 days.

The hospital in the camp was very basic and there was a
constant lack of doctors and a scarcity of food and water. The UN would
transport food trucks to the camp and distribute food such as rice, oil,
onions, pumpkin, chilli, lentils and bananas. It was up to us to buy meat and
other vegetables with the little money we could get from small jobs. We could
not leave the camp to get other food so whatever we were given, we accepted.
When the water ran out, we would have no water to cook rice so we could not eat
sufficiently and had poor nutrition, which led to a lack of concentration at
school and hunger pains.  Years later,
the UN started to provide us with breakfast at the school which was cooked in a
small kitchen and could be best described as ‘wheat powder’ porridge. Life at
the time was like that of a camel living in the dessert without food but
carrying water on its back to survive…. and at many times, without the water.My father needed to earn some money for us so he became a
‘pastor’ in the camp. We were of the Hindu faith. He would walk to peoples’
homes, reading and praying with them and they would give him a small amount of
money for his services.  That money was
used for our food.""

This campaign is important to me and all the people involved because we are currently in a period of time where the world is in turmoil, and inspiration, hope and faith is crucial to our well being. Supporting this campaign will allow us to reach out to people and touch their hearts with these real life experiences. 
(Pictured: Line with her mother and statue of her three aunts: All nuns)What We Need & What You GetI would love to make the book available in English, French and Spanish so that all the refugee families involved can have it available in their native language and share it with others globally. I need all the versions of the book reviewed with final edits, as well as the book cover designed, and all the interior designs completed for all three versions. We are asking for $23,000  of our $40,000 target to get this project to the next stage so we can approach potential publishers globally. The funds will go to the people required to finish this project professionally (as mentioned above). So far, we have had nearly 30 volunteers from Australia and Canada to get the project to this point. They are amazing individuals. (Pictured: Valerie - Liaison who organized all the refugee meetings)Any person that donates up to $100 will get a free copy of the ebook upon release and donations above $100 will automatically get a paperback version of the book delivered to them, as well as their names acknowledged within the book / website. Any large contributions will receive free publicity on our website.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Dr. Lucinda M. Deason.  I have a doctoral degree in Political Science with a major in Public Policy and Administration and Research Methods from Michigan State University.  I am a former Tenured Associate Professor that taught at the University of Akron.  I was molested by my maternal uncle when I was 4 years old.  I was stalked three times during my life by an ex-husband and former guys I dated.  Further, on 4 separate occasions different guys who were acquaintances attempted to rape me.  I overcame the trauma from these experiences and decided to write and self-publish a book to provide females ages 12 and up with a variety of spiritual, mental, and physical strategies to enhance their personal safety and reduce the likelihood them being raped.  I have written the entire book. I am now in the process of revising and editing the book.  In addition to the book, I have been conducting <strong>free</strong> workshops with females to equip them with some of the strategies I cover in my upcoming book.</p>
<p>We live in a violent society where females are attacked on a daily basis. In 2011 statistics indicate that or the reported rapes, approximately 20% of women in the U.S. have survived a completed or attempted rape.  The Justice Department estimates that one in five women will experience rape or attempted rape during their college years, and that less than five percent of these rapes will be reported.  Females age 24 and under suffer from the highest rates of rape.</p>
<p>Research shows that females who defend themselves from a sexual predator are less likely to be raped or the severity of the attack is minor in comparison to those females who do not defend themselves.  The females who do not defend themselves are more likely to be severely injured and/or killed.  I experienced 4 attempted rapes in my lifetime and some of the spiritual, mental, and physical strategies I cover in my book and workshops helped me to escape.  I want use my book and free workshops to empower and equip females with effective personal safety strategies.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I want to raise $15,000 to cover the cost of printing the book, creating a website, and travelling to colleges and universities over the next 3 years.  I plan to use the money I raise from this campaign to help me cover the cost of printing, creating a website, and conducting free personal safety workshops that teach at-risk females spiritual, mental, and physical strategies to enhance their personal safety based upon my book over the next 3 years.  The contents of the book and workshop will help females to enhance personal safety and reduce the number females who are at high risk for being sexually assaulted.  If I don’t reach my funding goal, I will use the funds to cover printing cost for my book first, the website, and then whatever is left over, I will use to help me travel to colleges and universities around the country.</p>

<p> I have 2 previous books,<i> Refuse</i> and <i>I Know Very Well
How I Got My Name. </i>In 2011, <i>Refuse </i>was a finalist in the Rainbow Book Awards in several categories .
In 2013,<i> I Know Very Well How I Got My Name</i> was the winner for Best Transgender Fiction. I have also written
for <i>Original Plumbing, The New York Times</i>, Trans-Genre.net, and other
publications.  I had a short story in <i>The Collection</i>, a transgender
anthology which won the 2012 Lambda Literary Award.  My work has
received favorable reviews from <i>Kirkus Reviews, Out in Print Queer Book
Reviews, Lambda Literary, </i>and <i>Publishers’ Weekly, </i>to name a few.  Mark Simpson, a British
journalist for <i>The Guardian</i> and the author of <i>Saint Morrissey</i>, called my first novel
“irresistible.”  <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> referred to my work as “well written,
nuanced…pioneering examples of transgender fiction.” My writing has been read by
gender studies and literature classes at New York University, Trent University,
The New School, SUNY Fredonia, Onondaga Community College, and more. Despite this, my
work remains largely unknown to the general public as well as within the
transgender community. This is because I have extremely limited promotional
power. I work almost entirely on my own with no budget.</p>

<p>1. There aren't a lot of
trans authors who have published novels. It's important we are represented at
larger LGBTQ literary events. In addition, most books with transgender
characters are not written by transgender authors. Mine are among the few
exceptions. </p>
<p>2. Few successful queer
writers live outside expensive major metropolitan centers like NYC, San
Francisco, LA. Millions of queer people live elsewhere but don’t see their
lives reflected in queer culture. I am from Syracuse, NY and write from this
perspective. It makes for fresh writing. I think that my less than glamorous
lifestyle resonates with many people. </p>
<p>3. I receive an estimate of 2
or 3 emails/messages a month from transgender people telling me how important
my books were to them. A lot of these people have told me they never read
anything else like my books and that it helped them accept themselves. Some of
these people have been as young as 13. </p>
<p>4. I find it inspiring to believe
that independent artists can succeed despite the climate of the publishing
world. I don’t have any of the traditional assistance or funding that most
authors possess. It’s just me on my laptop. And yet the

<p>Mara lleva seis meses junto a Jon y se siente feliz al lado de un
hombre atento, cariñoso y educado como él. Aun así, después de todo este tiempo, Mara apenas conoce nada sobre el
pasado del hombre al que ama. Una noche, ya cansada de evasivas, Mara
insiste a Jon para que le cuente la historia de su vida. Durante esa
noche, Mara descubre un pasado lleno de luces y sombras escuchando la
historia de su pareja  con la ayuda de una caja llena de recuerdos.</p>
<p>
Así empieza <b><i>Las Ruinas de Valhalla</i></b>, un viaje a través del
tiempo, una mirada al pasado,  en la que un antiguo integrante de una
banda de <i>Heavy Metal</i> vuelve a liberar sus demonios interiores,
unos demonios que, hasta ese día, creía muertos y enterrados.</p>

Mara lleva seis meses junto a Jon y se siente feliz al lado de un
hombre atento, cariñoso y educado como él. Aun así, después de todo este tiempo, Mara apenas conoce nada sobre el
pasado del hombre al que ama. Una noche, ya cansada de evasivas, Mara
insiste a Jon para que le cuente la historia de su vida. Durante esa
noche, Mara descubre un pasado lleno de luces y sombras escuchando la
historia de su pareja  con la ayuda de una caja llena de recuerdos.

Así empieza Las Ruinas de Valhalla, un viaje a través del
tiempo, una mirada al pasado,  en la que un antiguo integrante de una
banda de Heavy Metal vuelve a liberar sus demonios interiores,
unos demonios que, hasta ese día, creía muertos y enterrados.

<p><i>In Search of Emiline</i> is the final book of a two-part series and documentary about the life of Emiline Watts Brewer, my great-grandmother. After first being introduced to Emiline’s story, I immediately knew that she epitomized the many struggles of former slaves who were determined to move forward with new lives as freed people. Despite the hardships she endured as a slave, she persevered, succeeded despite the odds and went on to live a remarkable life. Her success has encouraged scores of her descendants to achieve and greatly contribute to society.</p>

<p align=""center"">Emiline Watts Brewer</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlike many women of her time, Emiline had a profession as a respected midwife who delivered both black and white babies in her town. So inspired by her work, one of her grandsons who tagged along behind her and carried her bag when she went to help mothers with their deliveries became a health professional. Another grandson was one of the first African Americans to graduate from Northwestern School of Dentistry. A third grandson graduated from Meharry Medical School (now Meharry Medical College) and became a physician; a fourth was a pharmacist. </p>
<p>Although Emiline was denied education during slavery, she stressed its importance and the power of knowledge in liberating a person. She passed this message down to her descendants who valued also education and excelled in their professions.</p>
<p> </p>

<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""left"">Emiline’s civic-minded husband Robert Brewer purchased land and built the Oro United Methodist Church when former slaves refused to sit in a local church’s segregated balcony. Following in his footsteps, Emiline who was concerned that Black children had to walk too far to attend a neighboring church, asked her son Isaiah to portion off some of the Brewer land and build the Wesley Chapel Church (now the Wesley Chapel United Methodist Church). Not far from the church, the Brewers built the Wesley Chapel School, one of the famous Rosenwald schools. The family owned, ran and taught at another Rosenwald school- The Colored School in Guess. The Rosenwald schools are now National Historic sites.</p>

<p> The two families remain united around Emiline. They have known about her and their relationship to the Brewers since childhood. Today, we constantly email, telephone or visit each other. And just recently, I was contacted by branch of the Watts family-the descendants of Jerome Watts. He was the son of Thomas H. Watts and brother of Townley Blair Watts. These family members also knew about Emiline and their relationship to the Brewers.</p>

<p><b>I have been very dedicated to working on the </b><b><i>In Search of Emiline </i></b><b>project for the past two years</b>.</p>
<p><br/>I am a writer who has written several books including: <em>A View from the Top:<br/>the Inspiring Success Stories of 15 Black CEOs, Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs</em> (CMI Business Books); <em>Success Strategies for African Americans</em> (Dutton); <em>The Black Woman’s Career Guide</em> (Doubleday); <em>Careers For Women Without College Degrees</em> (McGraw-Hill);<em> How To Change Careers</em> (Putnam). To date,<em> Children Go Where I Send Thee: The Brewers Uncover Their Roots</em>, one of the books in the <i>In Search of Emiline </i>two-part series has already been completed.  The second book is about 50% finished and provides more fascinating information about Emiline’s story. The documentary is in pre-production.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Why We Need The Funding? </h3>
<p> </p>

In Search of Emiline is the final book of a two-part series and documentary about the life of Emiline Watts Brewer, my great-grandmother. After first being introduced to Emiline’s story, I immediately knew that she epitomized the many struggles of former slaves who were determined to move forward with new lives as freed people. Despite the hardships she endured as a slave, she persevered, succeeded despite the odds and went on to live a remarkable life. Her success has encouraged scores of her descendants to achieve and greatly contribute to society.
 

Emiline Watts Brewer
 
Unlike many women of her time, Emiline had a profession as a respected midwife who delivered both black and white babies in her town. So inspired by her work, one of her grandsons who tagged along behind her and carried her bag when she went to help mothers with their deliveries became a health professional. Another grandson was one of the first African Americans to graduate from Northwestern School of Dentistry. A third grandson graduated from Meharry Medical School (now Meharry Medical College) and became a physician; a fourth was a pharmacist. 
Although Emiline was denied education during slavery, she stressed its importance and the power of knowledge in liberating a person. She passed this message down to her descendants who valued also education and excelled in their professions.
 

 
Emiline’s civic-minded husband Robert Brewer purchased land and built the Oro United Methodist Church when former slaves refused to sit in a local church’s segregated balcony. Following in his footsteps, Emiline who was concerned that Black children had to walk too far to attend a neighboring church, asked her son Isaiah to portion off some of the Brewer land and build the Wesley Chapel Church (now the Wesley Chapel United Methodist Church). Not far from the church, the Brewers built the Wesley Chapel School, one of the famous Rosenwald schools. The family owned, ran and taught at another Rosenwald school- The Colored School in Guess. The Rosenwald schools are now National Historic sites.
 
 

Emiline built the Wesley Chapel United Methodist Church in 1904
 
 

 Two years ago on the same day as the dedication of the memorial in Washington, D.C. to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who once dreamed the descendantsof slaves and slave owners would meet one day, Emiline’s story became fullcircle. A group of her descendants met with members of her slave owner’s family. 
 

 The two families remain united around Emiline. They have known about her and their relationship to the Brewers since childhood. Today, we constantly email, telephone or visit each other. And just recently, I was contacted by branch of the Watts family-the descendants of Jerome Watts. He was the son of Thomas H. Watts and brother of Townley Blair Watts. These family members also knew about Emiline and their relationship to the Brewers.
See more about the Brewers and Watts families..Robert and Emiline, their children, their accomplishments, the Watts children, Watts descendants, etc......at the Gallery!!! 

Jerome Watts, Thomas H. Watts’ son
 
I have been very dedicated to working on the In Search of Emiline project for the past two years.
I am a writer who has written several books including: A View from the Top:the Inspiring Success Stories of 15 Black CEOs, Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs (CMI Business Books); Success Strategies for African Americans (Dutton); The Black Woman’s Career Guide (Doubleday); Careers For Women Without College Degrees (McGraw-Hill); How To Change Careers (Putnam). To date, Children Go Where I Send Thee: The Brewers Uncover Their Roots, one of the books in the In Search of Emiline two-part series has already been completed.  The second book is about 50% finished and provides more fascinating information about Emiline’s story. The documentary is in pre-production.

Why We Need The Funding? 
 
The main focus of my project is to finish the second book in our series andalso preproduction of the In Search of Emiline documentary. Up until now, I have personally paid for all the research, writing and production costs in association with the first book. As I am getting closer to completing the second book about Emiline, I will need your help in raising additional funds to publish, print and convert it into paperback, hardcover and as an e-book. The raised funds will also go for completing pre-production of the In Search of Emiline documentary. To accomplish finishing this stage, I am presently in the process of planning, scripting, storyboarding, selecting vintage footage,preparing for shooting in South Carolina, developing a filming schedule, choosing musical compositions to be used, script-locking for finalization, etc. In the future, we will begin filming more of the Brewer and Watts family members as well as a historian specializing in the AnteBellum South, scenes in Chesterfield County, etc.

<p>I'm Alice, a native Brit who has lived in Northern California since 1998.  Late last year I abandoned San Francisco and moved to Sonoma Co. to live a slow food lifestyle. My new blog, Alice Dishes, will chronicle my personal adventures and lessons learned trying to live a real food/slow food lifestyle. I'll also write reviews and share tips in a section called ""Alice Bites"", which will cover suppliers, chefs, restaurants, food, and even kitchen gadgets, in the real food world.</p>
<p>Sure, I could have put up a hobbyist blog on Tumblr, but that would have been far too easy. I want to create a beautiful, entertaining and informative site, and potentiallly turn this project into a book down the road, so I'm raising funds to design, develop and launch my own site.</p>
<p>Your contributions will be used to pay my awesome designer, who helped me come up with the Alice Dishes logo and created the layout of the blog, my fab web developer and my highly critical writing coach who's ensuring that this really is a blog you'll want to read. I don't need much, but if you can spare a few cents, I'll be forever grateful. After all, it would be too ironic to be a starving food writer. And if I don't raise my entire goal, I still plan to launch (but don't let that hold you back).</p>
<p>If you can't donate hard cash, then you can still help me get the word out about <a href=""http://www.alicedishes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.alicedishes.com</a> after it launches which should be within a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>For a taste of Alice Dishes, read on:</p>
<p><strong><em>The Fast Road to Slow Food</em></strong></p>
<p>""Late last year I uprooted the merry band that is my family – my third-grader son and our two black Labs I call “The Muppets” – from our long-time home in San Francisco. Our destination was South Sonoma County, just thirty minutes north of the Golden Gate bridge–a land literally rich in milk and honey, not to mention free range chickens and their golden-yoked eggs, bountiful organic fruits and vegetables, and vineyards along every highway. </p>
<p>""It wasn’t a decision that I took lightly, or for that matter, one that came easily. We were leaving a lot behind: a jewel of a home that I had painstakingly restored from top to bottom believing I would live out my days under its roof; our friends; a loving school community, and proximity to my day job, which mostly revolves around Silicon Valley. Not to mention San Francisco itself, a place I think of as the food capital of the world.</p>
<p>""Yet I yearned for a <a href=""http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/slow_food/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Slow Food</a> lifestyle that would allow me to buy seasonal fresh veggies straight from the farm and procure pastured meat from the place it was born, grazed and made ready for my table.  I hoped to hone my skills in the kitchen by cooking only what was in season: finding 101 ways to turn zucchini into a tasty meal was a problem I was dying to have. I wanted my son to grow up knowing where his food came from: seeing carrots at the farm store complete with their flouncy green tops and still muddy from the field, not packaged in convenient bite-sized pieces.""</p>
<p>To enjoy the rest of this essay, and enjoy many others, you'll have to wait until the official launch of Alice Dishes - hopefully, just in time for Thanksgiving.</p>

I’m Sylvie Imelda
Shene. For years, I was trapped in an emotional prison caused by traumas I
faced as the youngest of 10 children growing up in a poor village in Portugal. I
was able to escape my family, but years later, when I was a topless dancer at a
gentleman’s club in Phoenix, Arizona, I met a man who triggered the feelings of
anger and fear that were buried deep inside me, and pushed me into the depths
of despair. <br/></p><p></p>
<h3>Alice Miller saved my life.</h3><p>This toxic relationship
led me to the works of psychologist Alice Miller.
Her words spoke to me in a way that no one else had been able to. And believe me, I had
tried everything from 12-step programs and self-help books to meditation and yoga.
</p>
<p>Alice Miller did so much
for me, and I was fortunate enough to communicate with her directly on numerous
occasions before her death in 2010. <i><b>She
inspired me to tell my story, so more people could break free from the lies and
illusions that prevent them from being true to themselves.</b></i></p>
<h3>I'm passionate about helping others face their childhood traumas. <br/>
</h3><p>If someone had told me 30
years ago that this poor girl from rural Portugal would be living in America
and writing a book, I’d have thought they were crazy. But here I am with a
finished manuscript in hand, filled with personal stories from my dancing career plus wisdom that can help
liberate people from the pain of the past. </p>
<p>With your help, I’ll raise $17,500 or more to turn my manuscript into a real book within the next six
months. The money I raise through this campaign will cover the costs of <span>design, editing,
production and printing — and hopefully shipment to you!</span></p>
<h3><span>Thank you so much for your support.</span></h3><p><span>In
exchange for your support, you’ll be among the first to receive this
life-changing book, which is part memoir and part how-to guide. Each chapter
gives you important steps to take on your own path to freedom. </span>I’m also offering extra perks to show my gratitude,
everything from your name in the acknowledgements to a seat at my table during
the official book-release party. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for
contributing and/or sharing this campaign with people who can benefit
from my story. Your support could change someone’s life dramatically…Maybe even
your own!</p><b>Special Thanks!</b><br/>So many people have already helped me get to this point, and I want them all to know how much I appreciate their efforts. Huge hugs go to the management of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thelittlewoody"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Little Woody</a> in Phoenix, for letting me shoot the trailer shown above in their amazing bar and restaurant. That place rocks! <br/><br/>I also want to thank Charles Peterson for shooting and editing all the video, with a shout out to Chris Willembrecht for all his help, as well. Carrie Fee and Carl Calabrese captured the essence of me and my boyfriend back in the day, and I thank them for their wonderful acting abilities. I also want to thank my friend Kianté, who dj'd for me at Bourbon Street, for stepping up as the MC. For making the set look crowded, I owe a debt of gratitude to Eric O'Neill, Paul Wilson, Perry Herst, Steve Furedy, Xzetera Retterer and Eric Massey.  <br/><br/>Finally, the manuscript would never have been possible without the writing talents of Ed Sweet and Jon Roemer.

for me, and I was fortunate enough to communicate with her directly on numerous
occasions before her death in 2010. She
inspired me to tell my story, so more people could break free from the lies and
illusions that prevent them from being true to themselves.
I'm passionate about helping others face their childhood traumas. 
If someone had told me 30
years ago that this poor girl from rural Portugal would be living in America
and writing a book, I’d have thought they were crazy. But here I am with a
finished manuscript in hand, filled with personal stories from my dancing career plus wisdom that can help
liberate people from the pain of the past. 
With your help, I’ll raise $17,500 or more to turn my manuscript into a real book within the next six
months. The money I raise through this campaign will cover the costs of design, editing,
production and printing — and hopefully shipment to you!
Thank you so much for your support.In
exchange for your support, you’ll be among the first to receive this
life-changing book, which is part memoir and part how-to guide. Each chapter
gives you important steps to take on your own path to freedom. I’m also offering extra perks to show my gratitude,
everything from your name in the acknowledgements to a seat at my table during
the official book-release party. 
Thank you so much for
contributing and/or sharing this campaign with people who can benefit
from my story. Your support could change someone’s life dramatically…Maybe even
your own!Special Thanks!So many people have already helped me get to this point, and I want them all to know how much I appreciate their efforts. Huge hugs go to the management of The Little Woody in Phoenix, for letting me shoot the trailer shown above in their amazing bar and restaurant. That place rocks! I also want to thank Charles Peterson for shooting and editing all the video, with a shout out to Chris Willembrecht for all his help, as well. Carrie Fee and Carl Calabrese captured the essence of me and my boyfriend back in the day, and I thank them for their wonderful acting abilities. I also want to thank my friend Kianté, who dj'd for me at Bourbon Street, for stepping up as the MC. For making the set look crowded, I owe a debt of gratitude to Eric O'Neill, Paul Wilson, Perry Herst, Steve Furedy, Xzetera Retterer and Eric Massey.  Finally, the manuscript would never have been possible without the writing talents of Ed Sweet and Jon Roemer. Thanks so much guys!",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is April Stallworth.  I am a Christian Life Coach, Founder of the God's Uttermost Woman Ministry, Mother of a Teenage Daughter and a Woman of God.  These are the positions I am most proud of and where God can use me the best.  I am passionate about equipping, motivating and empowering the women of God to know who they are in Him.  I want them to know that they are royalty because they are Daughters of the King. God is so in love with them and has tremendous plans for their future.  I know, because I am a living testimony of his grace and mercy.  I am living my best life now and I am called to help other women do the same.  I know that I can do this in a major way through the self-publishing of my first 2 books.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These books will be used as a vehicle for hope, inspiration, encouragement and awareness.  Women will begin to see, think and behave in ways they never have before.  Women will begin to connect with God or deepen their current relationship with Him.  This will result in a greater confidence, stronger self-esteem and the finding of purpose for their lives.  Armed with that, women are less likely to fall into abusive relationships, depression, isolation, negative self-talk, sexual indiscretions or living up to the stereotypes of this world.  I am so sick and tired of the images we see on reality television, music videos and in song lyrics.  Those things don't represent the true essence of the virtuous women that God created us to be.  Now is the time to make a change.  Our culture is in serious trouble.  I'm not willing to sit idly by and let God's women continue to be hurt.  I know these books and my speaking to and with women will have a tremendous impact on their future.  Women just need the tools and resources in order to become who God intended them to be. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The amount of money raised from this campaign will go directly towards the self-publishing of my first two books.  The first book is entitled, ""It Wasn't Always That Way"", which is a daily devotional book for women that will encourage and inspire them.  It is a collection of a year long devotional that I wrote in 2008.  I received such tremendous feedback each day the devotional was sent out.  I know women were relating to my daily struggles and triumphs as I walked with God.  I want to be able to expose this book to the masses of women who need a daily word of encouragement.  My second book is entitled, ""Finding the Relationship of Your Dreams"".  This book is my life's testimony.  It chronicles how I came to know the greatest love of my life, God.  I reveal to women how the longing in their heart will never be filled by a man, a career, a child or any material thing that they may have previously tried to use.  Instead, that place within them is reserved solely for God.  I learned that life lesson after a series of painful relationships and poor choices.  But thanks be unto God, that is not the end of my story.  My story is one of healing, wholeness, security, stability, purpose, vision and triumph that I want to share with the world.  If I don't reach my goal in this forum, I will use whatever is raised towards my self-publishing project and truly believe that God will make up the difference.  I know that whatever God ordains, He provides for.   <br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>""The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much"" (James 5:16)  I know that prayer changes things.  Your prayers are powerful and I need them now more than ever.  I also need your support to get the word out about this campaign.  Please forward this information to everyone in your circle of influence.  There are share tools right here on this page so that you can post this campaign on the various social media outlets.  In advance, I thank you for your love, support and prayers. I appreciate them more than you will ever know.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Lori Hanson, an award-winning author, coach and motivational speaker. I started <a href=""http://Learn2Balance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Learn2Balance</a> five years ago with a mission to help people improve their quality of life holistically. I've spoken to many thousands of women, college students and teens and regardless of their situation in life stress is a root cause. That's why I created my Stress Survival Kit series.</p>
<p>Stress is a huge issue for strong, driven, working women who juggle many roles in life. When I tell women about this book, they all want a copy right now, ""I need to read that book!"" I've heard over and over. Several women have asked to be on the list to get one of the first copies.</p>
<p>So I've started an Indiegogo campaign to ask for your help to get the book designed, published and promote it nationally. The book is 95% written and with your contributions I'll reach my goal of having it available for my fall women's programs. As much as I love being a keynote speaker, 60-90 minutes doesn't always sink in over the long haul. The audience needs a book to take home with them to continue to study and connect with the Learn2Balance message to reduce stress, live in the moment and enjoy life.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign will help us cover book production costs, printing and a national publicity campaign. The good news is I have a great team of people I've worked with on my three previous books that do my covers, design and printing. I haven't done a big publicity tour since my first book, <em>It Started with Pop-Tarts</em> came out. But my favorite publicist who gets great results is ready and waiting to help me once again. And because this book has a broader appeal than Pop-Tarts which was about bulimia, the national stage is very reachable for publicity.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $9,850. This will cover production costs, printing of 500 books and a three city tour plus promoting in New York on the morning talk shows. It also include national radio publicity campaign. The budget breaks down as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Book Production:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$   175 Book cover (brand is already established so this is small)</li>
<li>$1,200 Book design         </li>
<li>$   750 Editor                     </li>
<li>$1,250 Printing (500 books)       </li>
</ul><p><strong>$3,350 Total Production </strong></p>
<p><strong>Book Publicity Campaign &amp; Three City Tour</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$2100 Publicity three cities (San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago)</li>
<li>$1500 Publicity National TV (New York)</li>
<li>$2500 Publicity National Radio (35-40 shows)</li>
<li>$  250 Press Kit                               </li>
<li>$1250 Travel (3 cities)                  </li>
</ul><p><strong>$5500 Total Publicity Campaign</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 Shipping Indiegogo gifts</li>
</ul><p><strong>$9850 </strong><strong>Budget Grand Total                       </strong></p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal<br/></strong>This budget is obviously grass roots as it only includes printing 500 books, and a lot of those will be shared with my Indiegogo contributors. Our stretch goal is $14,500, that will allow us to print more books (1000-1500) add pictures and illustrations in the book and include a fourth city in the publicity tour (Phoenix or Seattle)</p>
<p><strong>Cool Perks for You!<br/></strong>We've created some totally cool perks for you. If you donate $10 you get a copy of the book in ebook form. You'll notice the wolf theme throughout the perks as that ties into the message in the book. Wolf packs and human packs and how they relate to each other.</p>
<p>We've included some fun packages that range from book copies, to DVDs of my recent Women Who Rock Seminars (Rock Your Mindset, Rock Your Passion). You'll also find packages that include free subscriptions for our <a href=""http://BalanceforBusyWomen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Balance for Busy Women Program</a>. This is a monthly mailer that's delivered to your doorstep, or that of an alpha female you know who needs regular inspiration and reminders about balance and living in the moment. Our members love the content we share including the special guest interviews with celebs and practitioners.</p>
<p>One of the best perks we're providing is a free ticket to our first annual <a href=""http://learn2balance.com/2013prowomensretreat.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Learn2Balance Professional Women's Retreat</a> in Golden, Colorado on September 28th. Nine speakers on one stage and all there to help women relax, network with like-minded women and have some fun. These sessions include variety with interactive segments, you won't just be listening to people talk all day. You'll leave empowered, energized and relaxed. Our tag line is Set Your SELF F.R.E.E. (Find Relaxation, Energy &amp; Empowerment)</p>
<p>We've got awesome wolf pack perks for you because we are truly grateful to have your support so we can help the women who are struggling day-to-day to find peace, relaxation and joy in their lives. And just think, if you're the husband or other half how much easier it will be for you when they figure it out!</p>
<p><strong>Partial Goal<br/></strong>If for some reason we don't reach our full goal, I'll use the money you contribute to take the process as far as I can. I'll cut back on the publicity tour if needed and find other creative ways to share the book. However, I'm confident that working together we'll reach the goal for this project.</p>
<h3>The Impact this Project Will Have</h3>
<p>There is a strong need and demand for this information and this book. Not just because of stress, but from the misconception that being an alpha female is simply mirroring masculine traits. Being a strong leader is more than being aggressive and snarling at those who stand in your way. Often times when women ""come on too strong"" they are labeled a bitch, and it isn't as a compliment to an alpha female!</p>
<p>I've included interviews with four successful alpha females in this book. They agreed to share their story as examples of what happens when you lead by caring about and looking out for the pack. Mirroring wolf traits. These interviews include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dawn Gallagher, a model who appeared on over 300 magazine covers, a best-selling author, mom and now TV host in New York.</li>
<li>Dr. Cathie-Ann Lippman, who practices alternative medicine in Beverly Hills, California.</li>
<li>Victoria and Annette Quintana, two sisters who co-founded Istonish, Inc., and work together as CEO and Chairman, respectively in Greenwood Village, Colorado.</li>
</ul><p>All of these women have unique business and life experiences they share that will enlighten, inspire and motivate readers to seek a different path as the leader of their pack.</p>
<p>In addition to the interviews this book has lots of stories and anecdotes to relax and entertain the reader so they can begin to see the light. I've purposely made it a lot of fun to read because the topic is a deep one, contemplating lifelong habits and how to shift them to improve your quality of life.</p>
<p>There is a toolkit at the end of each chapter, followed by five affirmations. After reading through, it's a great resource to pick up and find just the message or tip you need for that day.</p>
<p>It is my belief that this book can and will become a best-seller and the message will be shared globally in multiple languages wherever women are struggling to lead and deal with the stress that accompanies the pack.</p>
<p>With healthy, everyday practices, we can succeed and kick ass in life with confidence, compassion, gratitude, balance and health.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you personally are not in a place to contribute financially you can still help out. If you know of women's organization, conferences or gatherings where this book would be a benefit, please <a href=""mailto:%20Speaker@Learn2Balance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">let us know</a> and share the information about our campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the Indiegogo links via Facebook and LinkedIn</li>
<li>Tweet information about our campaign and help us get others on board (or on the sled...wolves).</li>
</ul><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to visit, read, watch and understand why this campaign is so important. I am blessed to have you as a part of this process and grateful for your support.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a law student preparing for graduation. Before entering law school I was involved in many educational activities which utilized multiple different platforms including distance learning. My dream is to reach and educate citizens concerning their Constitutional Rights. Specifically the historical basis, reasoning behind, importance of protecting, and consequences of losing our Constitutional Rights. </p>
<p>As A Matter Of Law campaign is to setup the nonprofit organization to reach and teach citizens who do not have or may have minimal information as to our Constitutional Rights. Because an educated citizenry is necessary to a free society and a just government.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
I am a law student preparing for graduation. Before entering law school I was involved in many educational activities which utilized multiple different platforms including distance learning. My dream is to reach and educate citizens concerning their Constitutional Rights. Specifically the historical basis, reasoning behind, importance of protecting, and consequences of losing our Constitutional Rights. 
As A Matter Of Law campaign is to setup the nonprofit organization to reach and teach citizens who do not have or may have minimal information as to our Constitutional Rights. Because an educated citizenry is necessary to a free society and a just government.

What Is Needed & What You Get

$25,000 is needed to license A MATTER OF LAW as a nonprofit, setup a website and begin to develop educational materials as well as marketing in order to gain sponsorships.

A MATTER OF LAW website will, with your permission, list your name thanking you. 
The A MATTER OF LAW website will offer a means for every donor to submit suggestions and input.
With $1,000 donation you receive a note thanking all you awesome, awesome people.

But because the genocide had occurred only 12 years earlier, most Rwandans were still in survival mode. The second time I went, I had the unexpected opportunity to visit a Pygmy tribe where I was able to trade stories. When looking around the country, I noticed there was no library and the books I found in book stores and high end hotels were priced the same as in the United States. Since that visit, Rwanda now has one of the FEW libraries on the continent and many more citizens are going to University for a quality education. On my last visit, I was able to work with the Children's Librarian during International Read Week. I am a professional storyteller and she quickly put me to work, telling stories in 4 different schools and at the library, yet I found no traditional Rwandan stories in the library to tell. With her help, I will be making contacts in the publishing world in Rwanda. I have also made friends with one of the liaisons with the Pygmy tribe just outside of Kigali and will be traveling with him to the tribe to collect stories. I will also be working with a local art studio which currently works with orphans teaching art. I am proposing that we use these children to illustrate the stories I collect from the Pgymies. A portion of the sale of each book will be going to the Pygmy teller and to the student illustrator of each published book. This way, these underprivileged people will have an opportunity to attend University, something for them that is only in dreams. This project will be a win, win for everyone involved.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>How Can You Help?</h3> <p>Of course, everything costs money and that's where you come in. I am not working with a non-profit organization; I'm just a regular person doing something I think is worthwhile in this world. Your donation will help with all travel costs, airfare, taxis, bus fares, hotels, food, translators, publishing, and art supplies. Airfare will take the lion's chunk of the donations, usually running between $1,200 and $2,000 depending on the time of year for travel. I will be bringing all of my own art supplies because when I asked about getting something as simple as paper plates for paint, they weren't sure they could find them. Art supplies will be another big expense, along with the hotel costs. Surprisingly, taxis are expensive as well, so I'm going to try and learn the bus system, which usually means learning a basic amount of the Kinyarwandan language. I'll keep you posted on how that goes.</p>
<p>Speaking of that, one thing I'll do for you when you donate is you will receive a running blog of my travels. I've been writing a daily ""diary"" when I travel and you will receive them along with several photos from the events of the day. Here is an excerpt from one of my visits to the Pygmy people several years ago.</p>
<p>17 Janiver, 2011  ....""I hope to collect a couple more stories. Claude is tall and lean. He coaches and plays soccer (Rwandan football) and is very athletic. He usually does this Sunday mornings and then goes out to see the Pygmies on Sunday afternoons. He doesn’t go out every Sunday and I don’t think they are expecting him this Sunday, but he will go with us. He is not the same Field Operative who went with us last year when we delivered flour and beans. When we get to the end of the bus line, we depart and Claude starts looking for motorcycle taxis. This will definitely be a trip to remember. I have packed plenty of water and my storytelling felt board for my “Legs, Arms, Body” story for the Pygmies. It sticks out of my backpack and I can’t get it all the way closed. I’m afraid with the wind, that it will catch, pull the zipper open and I will lose it. As I mount the motorcycle, I think this might be a problem, so I wrap my arm back around the backpack to keep it closed. This leaves only one hand hanging onto the bar at the back of the motorcycle. I do not need to fear as I think my driver was more afraid than I was. He was so careful that he slowed way down and carefully negotiated the ruts, dodged water puddles, and kept the bike as upright as possible. He was so careful, it was comical. We got so far behind that at one point he had to stop and ask which way the other motorcycles had gone. I had to smile to myself as I might have been the first muzungu woman whom he’d had to taxi up into the hills outside of Kigali. Once again, I was a hit and the people along the way would shout out Muzungu! And wave. My helmet was too big and kept sliding forward over my eyes, but my blond hair waving out the back and light skin was a dead giveaway. My driver laughed as we went. I wonder if he’d ever been the star of a parade before. I was glad I had protected my backpack, because sure enough, the wind had caught the story board and had opened my backpack zipper. I didn't lose anything, but without my arm around the pack, I might have.....""<br/></p>
<p>I will also be making prints of the artwork created by the children for the books. These prints will be available for donors, along with bookmarks with the children's artwork and eventually the published books. The past visits to Rwanda have been out of my own pocket, and I've been able to make progress with important contacts in the country with this project, but now feel like I'm ready to make the next step to finalize, write, illustrate and then publish these treasures. That will take more money than I have, so I really appreciate your support!</p>
<p>I will use the funds I collect from supportive people like yourself to fund my upcoming trip. IF I don't get full funding, I will use what I collect to go as far as I can, maybe having to put the publishing part on hold or maybe not taking as many art supplies as I would like to. IF I get MORE funding that I request, then I can guarantee you that that money will be used to publish as many stories as I collect, complete with some wonderful artwork. The more stories I collect, of course, the greater the cost, so hopefully the Pygmies have years and years of stories to tell me.</p>

</div><div> <p>You bet it will! The stories I collect will be one-of-a-kind because the Pygmy people are basically an illiterate people, meaning their stories have been passed down from generation to generation. These stories will be the original folklore of the people of Rwanda. Many more citizens of Rwanda are becoming educated and are essentially throwing their old ways out the window. I was talking to a Canadian couple the last time I visited and mentioned that I was afraid some of these stories might be lost in just a generation or two. They said it might be sooner than that. With this project I want to stress to the Rwandans just how important their literature is to them and the world. It reflects their culture, their history, them. I'm really looking forward to learning more about these people and sharing this story with you and the rest of the world. I hope you join me. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Rwanda is a mostly French and Kinyarwandan speaking country. I speak fair French and am learning more every day. Many Rwandans speak broken English and are learning every day also. My translator Claude will be going with me to visit the Pygmies and he speaks fairly good English, great French and Kinyarwandan and I will also bring another translator with me. I will be filming the experience so what I don't get translated on the spot, I will have other Rwandan friends help me with the translation before I leave. I will be hand writing the gist of each story and then filling out the details later in true storytelling fashion. Claude's wife will help me with the history of the people and how they came to this location just outside of Kigali.</p>
<p>When I returned from my last trip, I attended a forum of publishers and I have one publisher in Illinois who is interested in the stories I collect. I feel confident that they will help me with this part of the project. I also was able to make several contacts of publishers in Rwanda itself. I will most likely publish the books both in Rwanda and in the US to save on shipping costs around the world. From what I hear, rejection is common, but persistence pays off. I feel this is an important project and I have the drive to make sure someone else feels that way also to get them published.</p>

<p>Another way to help is to donate art supplies. I will be taking what I can with me from the donations. I will be working with a local art studio in Rwanda and teaching art classes, but they have no art supplies. I will bring what I can each time I return. Contact me if you would like to donate art supplies.</p>
<p>Thank you SO much for considering my project. I am humbled and excited all at the same time. Your support just proves to me what an important impact this will be for the world to come.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: 12 November!</b></p>
<p><b>The Editors are very pleased and proud to announce that ALL
PERKS ARE NOW GUARANTEED!  We WILL be printing hardbacks, paperbacks,
prints, etc!  EVERYTHING in these perks can be now delivered!  We
still need to make as much as we can to try and pay the contributors what we
think they’re worth but the Editors have committed to the outcomes right here
and right now!  Thanks for the support so far, now let’s do what we can in
the last month!</b></p>We have created an exciting Australian Horror Anthology: CTHULHU: DEEP DOWN UNDER.  Hundreds of pages of superb storytelling by 24 of the best Australian genre writers, backed by 24 brilliant artists producing amazing full colour plates for the book. 
<p>We need to pay the contributors, and we need to pay for a print run and a marketing campaign so that this amazing collection can be unleashed. </p>
<p>The collection has been edited by respected and experienced horror fiction writers and editors:  Steve Proposch (Bloodsongs magazine, current founder, editor Trouble magazine); Bryce Stevens (Terror Australis magazine, Bloodsongs magazine), and Christopher Sequeira (Terror Australis magazine, Sequence Productions comics).  </p>
<p>The Writers represent the cream of the Australian dark fantasy scene, with the finest genre novelists and screenwriters and even song lyricists amongst them: STEVE KILBEY, KAARON WARREN, AARON STERNS, JANEEN WEBB, JASON NAHRUNG, LUCY SUSSEX, JASON FRANKS, B. MICHAEL RADBURN, ROBERT HOOD, DMETRI KAKMI and many more.</p>
<p>The artists are amongst the finest in speculative vision-making: W. CHEW CHAN, BRUCE MUTARD, SARAH ELLERTON, PAUL MASON, GAVIN L. O'KEEFE and many more.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest living practitioner of the weird story, and certainly the most lauded exemplar of the Lovecraftian story, RAMSEY CAMPBELL, has written an original introduction just for this collection, entitled LOVECRAFT'S MONSTER.</p>
<p>We need to get as close as we can to our goal of $75,000 to take this book to the final stages of commercial reality and produce decent marketing and print runs.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <ul>
<li>We need to get as near as possible to $75,000 to make sure this very special, massive tome of words and pictures is properly proofed, prepped, printed and made available, and we need to pay these wonderful contributors for their work, and then market the project.  With 24 colour plates, too, we want decent quality paper and colour. A cheap newsprint job is unacceptable.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT NOTE: We don't have to hit the total to honour our pledges, but to do it the way we want to (properly), we need to get as near the target as possible. We aren't asking for charity to support this project, either. We want you to buy the book or one of the other pledges.</li>
<li>IF YOU PLEDGE, WE WILL HAVE THE BOOK OUT SOON, BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY DONE THE WORK!  DON'T BE WORRIED THAT WE WON'T DELIVER. WE MADE ""DELIVERING"" THE PRIORITY WITH THIS CAMPAIGN! </li> <li>Much of the hard creative work in this book is already done. 24 stories written! 23 illustrations finished! The galleys are in! Author correction notes in! Cover illustration and design all done!</li>
<li>We have paperbacks, digital versions, hardback limited editions, posters and unique paraphernalia on offer, as well as original, one of a kind artworks as perks for this project.  </li>
<li>We did not create this book via open submissions, which would have been impossible with no budget to begin with. Instead, we approached a number of trusted professionals in our various networks, all of whom kindly took the risk of devoting their enormously valuable time to produce a story or illustration unpaid. None of these amazing creators have received a cent as yet. But we can leverage this fact, for you, the supporters. There are perks available that involve editorial and story consultations from the top editors and writers that are represented in this project. Want advice on writing or art? You can pick up one of the one-on-one coaching perks!</li>
<li>This is a world-class anthology, and we're returning to the promise of Lovecraft's first ever Mythos story, 'The Call of Cthulhu', which specifically featured Australia in it. So why not push the envelope and buy an original artwork of YOURSELF battling Lovecraftian horrors in Australia?!</li>
<li>You don't need to know a thing about H. P. Lovecraft or Cthulhu to enjoy any of the stories in this book.  If you like the idea of a collection of well-crafted horror and dark fantasy tales all set in Australia, but all VERY different and original; this is the project for you! There are some taut action stories, tales of black humour, psycho-dramas, and an abundance of shocking, cosmic horror, all set in the land down under, or including a key connection to Australia or New Zealand.</li> <li>In all we have more than 50 creators to pay, and a significant amount of copies to produce to achieve our target. This project wouldn't work well as a print-on-demand book because the margins would be less than narrow, and we want to pay our amazing creators a decent, professional rate for their work. Your commitment to this project allows us to adjust our final print run to suit that commitment. Our pledge targets have been arrived at to reflect that fact. We have conducted print cost modelling and contribution modelling and concluded that a mainstream publisher would require a budget of $100K or more to generate a book like this in Australia, even considering the benefits of synergies and economies of scale.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>Australian readers have consistently told the Editors, as we've gone about our business, meeting genre fans in recent years, that they are hungry for locally set dark fiction; stories that are Australian without being cringe-inducing; geographically-specific, but thematically universal. This book attempts to deliver those goods in a large-production print-run that is properly marketed and distributed via the 'pre-sales' that this crowd-funding generates.</li>
<li>At the same time, this book is NOT just for Australians. We don't believe in parochial fantasy fiction for the sake of it. The stories in this book would be enjoyed by any lover of innovative weird fiction. This book was produced to be a great reading experience for anyone, from anywhere, especially those who like horror fiction and enjoy reading the Cthulhu tropes used in fresh and exciting ways.</li> <li>Everyone appearing in this book is a respected professional, whether long-standing or emerging. Some have credits on screenplays for major films, or novels, or short story collections, or major local or international TV, film, comic-book or movie work to their credit. Crack this tome open and you won't be disappointed by amateur level work. </li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul>
<li>We've done so much of the hard work already that production of this book is almost guaranteed. All we need from you is a pledge of support through perks that we believe are all commercially priced, and will actually provide you with value for money. We are not running this campaign as a charity, but as a commercial reality. </li>
<li>Don't have much cash but just want the book?  No worries, just buy it now, even just the digital version, through the pledge.  </li>
<li>Have more money and want a cool, original collectible?  Great; support us through that, too. </li>
<li>Want a unique chance to get some creative professional support in your own horror-themed writing or drawing, tips on how to hit an internationally competitive standard? We are the perfect group of people to help you through a creative coaching writing or art pledge; folks appearing within this book have sold their work to markets across the globe.</li>
<li>NOTE:  we've made the fund structure for receiving the funds in US dollars so that we can receive both Paypal and credit card funds. The production team is actually spread across Sydney and Johns River, in NSW, and Castlemaine, in Victoria, and our go-to video-guy is in Katoomba, NSW.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: 12 November!
The Editors are very pleased and proud to announce that ALL
PERKS ARE NOW GUARANTEED!  We WILL be printing hardbacks, paperbacks,
prints, etc!  EVERYTHING in these perks can be now delivered!  We
still need to make as much as we can to try and pay the contributors what we
think they’re worth but the Editors have committed to the outcomes right here
and right now!  Thanks for the support so far, now let’s do what we can in
the last month!We have created an exciting Australian Horror Anthology: CTHULHU: DEEP DOWN UNDER.  Hundreds of pages of superb storytelling by 24 of the best Australian genre writers, backed by 24 brilliant artists producing amazing full colour plates for the book. 
We need to pay the contributors, and we need to pay for a print run and a marketing campaign so that this amazing collection can be unleashed. 
The collection has been edited by respected and experienced horror fiction writers and editors:  Steve Proposch (Bloodsongs magazine, current founder, editor Trouble magazine); Bryce Stevens (Terror Australis magazine, Bloodsongs magazine), and Christopher Sequeira (Terror Australis magazine, Sequence Productions comics).  
The Writers represent the cream of the Australian dark fantasy scene, with the finest genre novelists and screenwriters and even song lyricists amongst them: STEVE KILBEY, KAARON WARREN, AARON STERNS, JANEEN WEBB, JASON NAHRUNG, LUCY SUSSEX, JASON FRANKS, B. MICHAEL RADBURN, ROBERT HOOD, DMETRI KAKMI and many more.
The artists are amongst the finest in speculative vision-making: W. CHEW CHAN, BRUCE MUTARD, SARAH ELLERTON, PAUL MASON, GAVIN L. O'KEEFE and many more.
Perhaps the greatest living practitioner of the weird story, and certainly the most lauded exemplar of the Lovecraftian story, RAMSEY CAMPBELL, has written an original introduction just for this collection, entitled LOVECRAFT'S MONSTER.
We need to get as close as we can to our goal of $75,000 to take this book to the final stages of commercial reality and produce decent marketing and print runs.
What We Need & What You Get
 
We need to get as near as possible to $75,000 to make sure this very special, massive tome of words and pictures is properly proofed, prepped, printed and made available, and we need to pay these wonderful contributors for their work, and then market the project.  With 24 colour plates, too, we want decent quality paper and colour. A cheap newsprint job is unacceptable.
IMPORTANT NOTE: We don't have to hit the total to honour our pledges, but to do it the way we want to (properly), we need to get as near the target as possible. We aren't asking for charity to support this project, either. We want you to buy the book or one of the other pledges.
IF YOU PLEDGE, WE WILL HAVE THE BOOK OUT SOON, BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY DONE THE WORK!  DON'T BE WORRIED THAT WE WON'T DELIVER. WE MADE ""DELIVERING"" THE PRIORITY WITH THIS CAMPAIGN!  Much of the hard creative work in this book is already done. 24 stories written! 23 illustrations finished! The galleys are in! Author correction notes in! Cover illustration and design all done!
We have paperbacks, digital versions, hardback limited editions, posters and unique paraphernalia on offer, as well as original, one of a kind artworks as perks for this project.  
We did not create this book via open submissions, which would have been impossible with no budget to begin with. Instead, we approached a number of trusted professionals in our various networks, all of whom kindly took the risk of devoting their enormously valuable time to produce a story or illustration unpaid. None of these amazing creators have received a cent as yet. But we can leverage this fact, for you, the supporters. There are perks available that involve editorial and story consultations from the top editors and writers that are represented in this project. Want advice on writing or art? You can pick up one of the one-on-one coaching perks!
This is a world-class anthology, and we're returning to the promise of Lovecraft's first ever Mythos story, 'The Call of Cthulhu', which specifically featured Australia in it. So why not push the envelope and buy an original artwork of YOURSELF battling Lovecraftian horrors in Australia?!
You don't need to know a thing about H. P. Lovecraft or Cthulhu to enjoy any of the stories in this book.  If you like the idea of a collection of well-crafted horror and dark fantasy tales all set in Australia, but all VERY different and original; this is the project for you! There are some taut action stories, tales of black humour, psycho-dramas, and an abundance of shocking, cosmic horror, all set in the land down under, or including a key connection to Australia or New Zealand. In all we have more than 50 creators to pay, and a significant amount of copies to produce to achieve our target. This project wouldn't work well as a print-on-demand book because the margins would be less than narrow, and we want to pay our amazing creators a decent, professional rate for their work. Your commitment to this project allows us to adjust our final print run to suit that commitment. Our pledge targets have been arrived at to reflect that fact. We have conducted print cost modelling and contribution modelling and concluded that a mainstream publisher would require a budget of $100K or more to generate a book like this in Australia, even considering the benefits of synergies and economies of scale. 
  The Impact 
Australian readers have consistently told the Editors, as we've gone about our business, meeting genre fans in recent years, that they are hungry for locally set dark fiction; stories that are Australian without being cringe-inducing; geographically-specific, but thematically universal. This book attempts to deliver those goods in a large-production print-run that is properly marketed and distributed via the 'pre-sales' that this crowd-funding generates.
At the same time, this book is NOT just for Australians. We don't believe in parochial fantasy fiction for the sake of it. The stories in this book would be enjoyed by any lover of innovative weird fiction. This book was produced to be a great reading experience for anyone, from anywhere, especially those who like horror fiction and enjoy reading the Cthulhu tropes used in fresh and exciting ways. Everyone appearing in this book is a respected professional, whether long-standing or emerging. Some have credits on screenplays for major films, or novels, or short story collections, or major local or international TV, film, comic-book or movie work to their credit. Crack this tome open and you won't be disappointed by amateur level work.  
  Risks & Challenges 
We've done so much of the hard work already that production of this book is almost guaranteed. All we need from you is a pledge of support through perks that we believe are all commercially priced, and will actually provide you with value for money. We are not running this campaign as a charity, but as a commercial reality. 
Don't have much cash but just want the book?  No worries, just buy it now, even just the digital version, through the pledge.  
Have more money and want a cool, original collectible?  Great; support us through that, too. 
Want a unique chance to get some creative professional support in your own horror-themed writing or drawing, tips on how to hit an internationally competitive standard? We are the perfect group of people to help you through a creative coaching writing or art pledge; folks appearing within this book have sold their work to markets across the globe.
NOTE:  we've made the fund structure for receiving the funds in US dollars so that we can receive both Paypal and credit card funds. The production team is actually spread across Sydney and Johns River, in NSW, and Castlemaine, in Victoria, and our go-to video-guy is in Katoomba, NSW. 
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Share, share share! Use the Indiegogo share tools! Tell every friend you have who is interested in awesome genre fiction that this project is ON!

<p>As a lockdown project Keg de Souza and I decided to write a book for our 3-year-old Ernie, inspired by a song we made up together one night called ‘foot feet’, which was about how confusing pluralisation can be. This made us think a book about irregular plurals for toddlers would be a fun way to teach kids about the peculiarities of the English language. We then decided to incorporate the concept into a counting book to give it dual purpose as a learning tool for both Plurals and Numbers. And that’s the origin story behind Plurals Can Be Weird (you will see) a cute counting / plurals book.</p>
<p>After Keg painstakingly assembled the book by collaging paper cut outs together to produce a single copy for Ernie, we thought the finished product turned out to be ‘pretty good’ and thought it pretty much stood up to most of the children’s books we have encountered as parents. So we have decided to publish our efforts in order to share the work with the world and as a way to supplement our income which as working artists has been decimated by the current outbreak.</p>
<p><strong>About the Artists</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keg de Souza</strong> is an Australian artist working with mediums such as; inflatable and temporary architecture, food, film, mapping and dialogical projects to explore the politics of space.  This investigation of social and spatial environments is influenced by her formal training in architecture and experiences of radical spaces through squatting and organising. She often creates site and situation specific projects with people, with an emphasis on knowledge exchange. Keg is a member of various collaborative groups, such as SquatSpace Artist Collective and is represented by Booklyn Artist Alliance, NY for her artist’s books and zines, which she has been self-publishing for over 15 years.</p>

<p>What the New York Times described as sounding like ""John Coltrane playing a volcano"" is in fact the unique work of maverick musician <strong>Lucas Abela</strong> whose infamous obsession with sheets of broken glass has astonished and bemused countless people around the world. Abela ecstatically purses his lips against panes of amplified glass while deftly employing various vocal techniques ranging from throat singing to raspberries to turn discarded shards into crude musical instruments. The results are a wild array of oddly controlled cacophonous noise teetering on the edge of music. A one of a kind act that quite simply needs to be witnessed to be fully appreciated, let alone understood.</p>

<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<p>As captured by renowned storyteller David JP Phillips, “One hundred thousand years ago, we started developing our language—it’s sound to say that we started using storytelling to transfer knowledge from generation to generation. Twenty seven thousand years ago we started transferring knowledge from generation to generation through cave paintings. Thirty five hundred years ago we started transferring knowledge from generation to generation through text. Twenty eight years ago PowerPoint was born. Which one do you think our brain is mostly adapted to?”<br/><br/>My name is Akshay Kamath and I am the author of <strong><i>Make It Matter: A Guide to Mastering the Art of the Pitch with Principled Storytelling</i></strong>. I wrote this book because I believe the value of storytelling in entrepreneurship is immeasurable, but the meaning of “storytelling” has unfortunately eroded over the years into an almost empty buzzword, all while it remains the defining, learnable skill that makes all the difference.<br/><br/>Once a young and determined student entrepreneur myself, I wanted to make my dent in the world. Instead, I was met with rejection and consolation at every opportunity to pitch my vision for a more equitable future for our youth. The moment I emphasized telling my audience a story was the moment that changed. But, this book is not about myself. It is an organized deep dive into successful pitching principles identified by many distinguished changemakers. I am confident that, by implementing these proven tactics, anyone can turn a simple vision into a powerful narrative that is positioned to make a difference.<br/><br/>A compilation and analysis of research and interviews, this book showcases successful changemakers who’ve harnessed the power of story to make an indelible mark across industries. In particular, you will have a lens into the narratives of</p>
<ul>
<li>Scott Harrison, who reinvented the meaning of charity and the role of a humanitarian non-profit</li>
<li>Hasan Minhaj, who changed the way a generation of Asian Americans grew up to view social justice</li>
<li>Oprah Winfrey, who gave the world a new form of communication with the power of her example</li>
</ul>
<p>After having suffered the endless loop of self-help books that, at times, can give false feelings of accomplishment, I’ve set out to craft the resource I wish I’d had when building something that mattered to me. In this book, you’ll find specific, actionable insights you can put into practice for a venture or initiative aligned with your passions. You’ll find principles that are as practical as they are encouraging. You won’t find empty platitudes. My hope is that you’ll walk away with a new perspective and tailored toolkit for delivering a purposeful pitch to any audience.<br/><br/>Whether you’re an entrepreneur with an interest in the impetus behind social movements or an aficionado of the art of telling or collecting great stories, you’ll enjoy this book.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>Make It Matter</i>
</h3>
<p><i>Make It Matter </i>is a nonfiction book, written in three parts.<br/><br/>Part 1: The Construction<br/>This section explores the value of and actionable steps to thread a clear and consistent message throughout your pitch, ensuring your way of thinking is aligned with that of your audience. You’ll learn how to assemble and spontaneously adjust a strong pitch backbone, a structural vessel through which emotional journeys become resonant and offer a shared experience to every listener.<br/><br/>Part 2: The Connection<br/>This section navigates the pitch details that help cultivate sincere relationships between entrepreneurs and their audiences. You’ll learn to refine pitches and have your audience oriented to care genuinely about what you care about. More importantly, you’ll be able to develop a personal connection that attributes meaning to your words in the context of your listeners' lives.<br/><br/>Part 3: The Command<br/>This section tours how entrepreneurs build a legacy for their stories. In examining the interaction of storytelling and leadership, you can differentiate your pitch from the rest in competitions and to investors, inspiring your audience to act (not just listen) and leaving an everlasting gift beyond the scope of a single pitch. You’ll learn how to disrupt patterns and make nuanced connections such that your audience, unsolicited, decides to act from the power of your story.</p>

Arya, the hero, his girlfriend and two friends meet in five lives and go through different hindrances on the way to reveal the secret of Liberation. The plot is based on real events. Stories of the four fictional characters are interwoven with the real historical facts; Arya meets the most famous Buddhist teachers each of which is a historical figure.

She then thought that a traditional or legendary story such as a myth or namthar will be the best choice.  “Nam Thar. Buddhist Myths” represents the history of Buddhism seen through the eyes of many figures, both historical and imagined.The action of the book takes place over 2,500 years, beginning in the 6th century BC and ending in the second half of the 20th century AC. Arya, the hero, his girlfriend and two friends meet in five lives and go through different hindrances on the way to reveal the secret of Liberation. The plot is based on real events. Stories of the four fictional characters are interwoven with the real historical facts; Arya meets the most famous Buddhist teachers each of which is a historical figure. Therefore, the book will be useful not only to a wide range of curious readers, but also to students and enthusiasts of East Asian history.The book is available in three languages Polish/Russian/English, and to cover production and printing costs Nam Thar Team launched two concurrent crowdfunding campaigns for the book, one on Indiegogo.com (Worldwide, Dec 8th, 2016), and the other on the Polish platform PolakPotrafi.pl (successfully launched on November 30th, 2016).You can pre-order the book on Indiegogo.com until January 31st 2017.  How to support the project and help us publish the book?

Summary
I'm Sam Qualiana, a screenwriter of independent films who has worked in numerous capacities on over 30 feature films in my career. My vocation has always been storytelling. I recently released my first novel Journey of the Avenger, which is available on Amazon:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BW8LZQY

I came up with the concept for Protectors of the Realm originally as a card game which I produced through Gamecrafter. More details here:https://captbligh1.wixsite.com/metroshiagames

Now I'm expanding the stories from the card game and writing each set into a novella. 
I've already finished the manuscript for the first story, edited and formatted it and it's ready to distribute through Amazon. It's 138 pages and 28,000+ words

I'm hoping that with your help, I can get a jump on releasing this first story to the world. By contributing to this campaign you'll help me pay for the artwork for the cover and make physical copies of the novella.
What We Need
I'm looking to raise $500.00 for the campaign.
All of that money will go towards distribution costs for the book. 
I will be self publishing through Amazon, I now have the artwork, so I will be releasing the book very soon. I could have this done in less than 1 month.

If we don't reach the goal, all that will do is slow me down. I will still work on raising the money myself to get what I need, but it will take more time and resources to complete. 
The good news is that anyone who chooses the digital PDF copy, will get it as soon as the campaign ends, regardless if we reach the goal or not. 
The Story
Protectors of the Realm: Vol 1
It was a time of wizards and dragons, during the seven hundred and fifth cycle of the seasons. Lifetimes after the second rise of Agarnai, the monster God.
 
As a young apprentice, Hipanos was accused of murdering one of his peers, an elf named Kayteen. Therefore he was banished from the Academy of Magic.
Many years later he returns to the spotlight as a powerful wizard, self-trained in magic from the dark and the light. Hipanos masters the art of necromancy, and plots to leave his mark on the realm—seeking revenge on those who cast him out—no matter what the cost.
Meanwhile, in Tala Fee, Sir Anthony Maddox learns the Black Knight, Jonathan Waddingham has invaded the peaceful city of Broadan. With the help of the powerful wizard, Meldock, Sir Anthony must lead his army to counter Waddingham before he brings Broadan to ashes.
 
Learn the story of the most powerful wizards in the realm. Discover the decline of a man that rises to become an overwhelming force of evil and the choices he makes to lead him there.
 
When evil arises, the Protectors of the Realm are called to action. But every choice, whether right or wrong, may hold consequences.

Other Ways You Can Help
I know that not everybody has a few extra bucks to spare. I wish I could donate to every friend's campaign that pops up, but in reality we can't always do that, so if you aren't able to donate even the smallest amount, I get it. 
Maybe you just don't like reading fantasy stories, that's fine too. It's not everybody's cup of tea. You're not hurting anyone's feelings having your own taste. 
But if either of those are the case and you still want to help, indiegogo has share tools that will allow you to at least spread the word. Even that small gesture can go a long way.

For the past 15 years our mission has been to <b>mobilize children in less resourced countries using the gifts and talents of our global community</b>. An estimated 65 million people are in need of wheelchairs and of those almost 6.5 children in less-resourced countries are in need of an adaptable wheelchair. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1999, our founders, Wayne and Lee-Ann Hanson traveled to
Kenya with a group of young adults. With the support of a doctor and a seating
specialist, 50 children were custom fit into their adaptable wheelchairs which
provided the therapeutic support they needed 
to function to the best of their ability. It was exciting to discover
how the Kenyan children’s lives were transformed when they were able to sit
proudly and interact with their families, their peers and with the American
youth. Great things happen when people are given the opportunity to reach out
and care to each other.</p>
<p>After realizing how many wheelchairs were needed around the
world, Wayne and Lee decided to develop wheelchairs and services specially
designed for children with severe disabilities. They also realized how
important it is to help the citizens in less resourced countries become more
self-sufficient by training the care-givers, and equipping them to build their
own wheelchairs. To-date, ROC Wheels has delivered over 10,000 wheelchairs which
has provided freedom of mobility for both the children and their families. ROC Chair production has been established
in  four countries. Inmates in the US
build ROC Kits which are assembled by students in the public schools. It is
exciting when people world-wide work together and accomplish great things
through the power of partnering. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Our campaign is directed to help us fund the tooling and
production  of our newest wheelchair, the
ROCKIT Chair. The ROCKIT Chair can be configured as 3 different wheelchairs; an
independent wheelchair, 3 wheeled all-terrain wheelchair or adaptive stroller. The
ROCKIT Chair is designed to serve children with even the most severe
disabilities A comparable adaptable wheelchair sells for over $4,000 on the
U.S. market because of the numerous seating and support features and the
wheelchair’s ability to grow, tilt and recline. 
It is also unique in its ability to fold compactly to accommodate
public transportation. </p>
<p>The ROCKIT is both a kit and a complete wheelchair. These kits will be sent to communities around the globe and help promote employment and development. In addition, completed chairs can be sent overseas to children that are in need of immediate support through one of our various wheelchair distributions. </p>
<p>To reduce production costs we are currently seeking $70,000 to outsource tooling for the pieces and parts to build these advanced wheelchairs and set up the ROCKIT Kits.In
addition, we are seeking $26,000 to build 100  ROCKIT Chair Kits which will be used to equip
people in Guatemala, Kosovo and the Dominican Republic to develop a sustainable
wheelchair delivery operation. By doing this we will be able to streamline our ability to equip people in less resourced countries to use the ROCKIT Kits to build chairs and provide employment. We will also be able to reduce the cost to make it more affordable and allow our global partner to purchase and distribute worldwide.</p>

<b>Mobility:</b>  Mobility is more than transportation, it is what enables a child to experience their surroundings with their community and family. Many of the children that we help are often left on dirt floors with no hope of every leaving a 6x6 area on the ground. Not only is this unsanitary and harmful to the child's health but it also makes the child feel hopeless and insignificant. Mobility and proper support helps creates that hope and it is one of the greatest gifts.  </div><div>
<b>Empowerment:</b> You will be making it possible for primary and secondary (K-12) students around the United States to participate in funding and building chairs, through our YEWTHS ROC program, to be sent to various destinations around the globe. These children not only gain valuable skills in teamwork, manufacturing, and volunteering, but also realize that they have gifts and talents that they can use to help the world. In addition, we currently employ inmates at the South Dakota State Correctional Facility to help create kits that will be used to make complete ROCKIT chairs by communities around the globe. </div><div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""From the Blood of Abel"" attempts to diagnose the root causes of humanity's violence, and then argues how the Bible offers a proper diagnosis. While this is not a light read by any means, it should be accessible for those interested in theology/anthropology/philosophy and especially those who are interested in peacemaking. </p>
<p>The release date will be sometime in the Fall/Winter of 2016.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I am asking for $2,000 in order to pay my editors, cover publishing costs, and if possible, for promoting the book. If I do not achieve my goal, my primary goal is to cover editing and publishing costs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In a time such as this, where violence pervades our world, this book is a timely one indeed.

<p>Grace and peace.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Short Summary
""From the Blood of Abel"" attempts to diagnose the root causes of humanity's violence, and then argues how the Bible offers a proper diagnosis. While this is not a light read by any means, it should be accessible for those interested in theology/anthropology/philosophy and especially those who are interested in peacemaking. 
The release date will be sometime in the Fall/Winter of 2016.

What I Need
I am asking for $2,000 in order to pay my editors, cover publishing costs, and if possible, for promoting the book. If I do not achieve my goal, my primary goal is to cover editing and publishing costs.

The Impact
In a time such as this, where violence pervades our world, this book is a timely one indeed. We are in desperate need of a solution to this problem, which I believe is found in the Gospel of Christ Jesus, or as St. Paul called it, ""the gospel of peace."" With your help, this book has the potential to impact others in a most profound way.
So thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide. I am reverentially grateful.

<strong>The story</strong><strong></strong>
</h3>
<p>Peter and Robert are two university students in their mid twenties from Hungary. Their aim is to discover the United States from a unique and personal perspective you’ve never seen before. Twenty years after the fall of Communism two youngsters set out to discover the idealized West and the American dream of their childhood, or what’s left of it. All of our experiences and gathered knowledge will be put into a book for readers to enjoy and learn. The forty day long road trip across eighteen states will shed light on important contemporary topics and issues. To truly discover the country you need to know its people. This project is focused on people and their feelings and ambitions.</p>
<h3 align=""left""><strong>The product</strong></h3>
<p align=""left"">The book will come out in two languages, Hungarian and English. Peter will be doing most of the writing in his beloved Hungarian, while Robert will be doing the translations almost simultaneously. We intend to tell our stories in a handful of loosely connected articles, or journey entries.</p>
<p align=""left"">There’s more!  You see we understand that waiting for a book to come out can feel like an eternity, and that is why we will have a site during our journey with daily updates. Photos, video entries and short notes will help you keep up with our progress, feel part of the action!</p>
<h3 align=""left"">
<br/><strong>Where do we stand</strong>
</h3>
<p>The project’s target is 3500$ which will be required for the printing of the book, post and packing costs and most important of all car rental. The plane tickets, transport tickets and deposits have been paid with our hard-earned money, so we’re definitely going. We have already invested thousands of dollars in this project so we need your help to give us a final go. Here’s where your money will go:</p>

<p>Thank you kindly for viewing this. I am so very grateful to be sharing this with you. I believe that through story, art, and food, defenses are broken. There is so much beauty that deserves exposure and I have a burning passion to expose it. Many countries are looked at as failing  economies and wastes of space. Its sad, it really is. The goal is to create an awareness of the beauty that already exists in the world and celebrate it. One of the greatest gifts we have been given is creativity.

Through reading the stories of women and cooking the foods they cook, we are creating a natural sense of togetherness.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After eight years, and many hours later, I have finally finished my songwriter's book, working title - The Songwriter's Voice. </p>
<p>I left songwriting in 1976 and didn't return until 1998.  I was told I wasn't any good and I pawned my guitar for $25 and went to sleep.</p>
<p>When I returned I was so unsure of myself that I didn't think I was going to pursue it. But a mentor helped me through.  He is the catalyst for this book. I asked him questions by email, late at night and he always responded with candor.</p>
<p>This went on for three years. I started to think if other writers felt the same way as I did. So I asked them.  26 writers to be exact from all across Canada and the US. They responded - each and every one and this is their story.</p>
<p>All the writers answered the same questions thoughtfully and the similarities are remarkable. But so are the differences. It's a joy to read and very moving at times.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to find out how many books to print, so we're running this campaign for pre-order.  The book is about 150 pages and is not a ""how-to"" book about songwriting. It's about the mind and voice of many songwriters.  It will be available in soft copy and Kindle. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I hope by sharing the words of many songwriters, others will be encouraged to pick up the pen and dabble.  Who knows?  It's the possible moment of ""a-ha"" that will move them forward.  Anyone you know who has ever wanted to write will benefit from this book.  It gives insight into how the songwriter's mind works - in the business, in the performing, in the writing.  It's something to start the conversation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't afford a book, please help us spread the word about this.  Schools that teach writing, music associations, anyone and anywhere writers gatther to ponder the process.  It's a great place to start a conversation. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a married father of two (soon to be three) girls, I don't have a lot of disposable income. What I do have is a burning passion to help make my city the best that it can be by becoming a City Council Member. Some quick facts about mysef:</p>
<ul>
<li>31 year old IT professional</li>
<li>As a child in a military family growing up, I never had the deep connection to any single place I lived. While the re-locations went a long ways toward making me the man I am today, I want my daughters to have deep roots in a good community. Part of my job as a father is to ensure that the community they live in stays on the right path, and the best way I can manage that is to serve as a City Council member.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Why am I asking for over $500 in funding?</p>
<p>While I have already purchase my campaign signs, campaign litereature is expensive. You may not be aware of this, but most city council campaigns are self-funded to the tune of thousands of dollars. I have just about maxed out on the amount I can afford to spend on this campaign. Left to purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>More campaign literature</li>
<li>More campaign signs</li>
<li>Door hangers</li>
<li>Fuel to travel to various neighborhoods to introduce myself to constituents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shoud I not reach my fundraising goal, the funds will be turned over to charity of my choice, but NOT political in nature.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In contributing to my campaign, you will be helping someone who otherwise might not be able to compete with the 'monied' folks in his town. I entered the race knowing I was at a disadvantage, and now I'm out to prove that funding doesn't have to come from deep personal pockets, or by cozying up to local businesses - it can come from folks who believe in the common man being able to make a difference. That's what your contribution really means - it's giving me a chance to make a difference in my community.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help monetarily, there ARE other things you can do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/AdamForCityCouncil"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/AdamForCityCouncil</a> and like the page - perception of popularity is important in political races.</li>
<li>If are local, contact me and offer to help in door-knocking, literature stuffing, etc.</li>
<li>If you aren't local, find a candidate near you at the local level you can help - no matter what you think, every local candidate needs help.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word!</li>

While I have already purchase my campaign signs, campaign litereature is expensive. You may not be aware of this, but most city council campaigns are self-funded to the tune of thousands of dollars. I have just about maxed out on the amount I can afford to spend on this campaign. Left to purchase:

More campaign literature
More campaign signs
Door hangers
Fuel to travel to various neighborhoods to introduce myself to constituents.

Shoud I not reach my fundraising goal, the funds will be turned over to charity of my choice, but NOT political in nature.


The Impact
In contributing to my campaign, you will be helping someone who otherwise might not be able to compete with the 'monied' folks in his town. I entered the race knowing I was at a disadvantage, and now I'm out to prove that funding doesn't have to come from deep personal pockets, or by cozying up to local businesses - it can come from folks who believe in the common man being able to make a difference. That's what your contribution really means - it's giving me a chance to make a difference in my community.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't help monetarily, there ARE other things you can do.

Go to http://www.facebook.com/AdamForCityCouncil and like the page - perception of popularity is important in political races.
If are local, contact me and offer to help in door-knocking, literature stuffing, etc.
If you aren't local, find a candidate near you at the local level you can help - no matter what you think, every local candidate needs help.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here's a not-so-brief summary:</strong></p>
<p>It's the first volume of a trilogy, and I'm calling the book, the whole trilogy or both ""The Black Train.""  It's a big damn thing, sprawling and ambitious in scope but focused and specific in execution, the story of a few small men who become enveloped in a series of events far larger than themselves.  The books are written as populist fare with an artistic and intellectual core, an exciting, page-turning adventure/thriller/horror/dark fantasy which, between the lines, offers complex examinations of and meditations on violence, courage, morality, friendship, and this great sprawling mass of a country we call America and even humanity itself, what we are (and aren't), and all the wonderful and terrible things we are capable of.</p>
<p>The novel deals with history, set 60 years in the past, and the way our past parallels our present and future, even when set in a fictional world (see: <em>Deadwood</em>, <em>Rome</em>, even <em>Game Of Thrones</em>, McCann's <em>Let The Great World Spin, </em>Lehane's <em>The Given Day </em>and <em>Live By Night</em>, pretty much everything James Ellroy has ever written), as well as class issues/struggles, racism, gender relations/politics, violence, technology and progress, the American consciousness and the notion of what civilization itself is, what it means, how it is maintained and advanced, sacrifice and struggle.  It's a big-hearted novel of big ideas, ambitious as hell, but still fun to read whether you pay attention to the subtext or not.  That, by the by, is what all art, and specifically literature, is supposed to do in my opinion.</p>
<p>The setting, at least at the outset, is Pittsburgh, PA, circa 1950.  William ""Cully"" Cullinane is a late-20s WWII vet, back in the States and trying to find his way.  He's found himself positioned halfway between his two best friends, from earliest childhood to the service to now: not straight enough (or with the requisite tolerance for BS) to be a cop like stalwart, obsessive David but not quite amoral enough to run around with the murderous, lethal Crack, though he tried the latter.  The life of a knockaround guy, freelance gun and muscle for various underworld figures, never quite worked but then again nothing else did either, and all Cully knows is he has a talent for the heavy work, violence, and he's not much use at anything else.  He finds himself almost by accident becoming an <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">unlicensed</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">private investigator, he wouldn't mind getting made legit he just keeps forgetting to get around to it.  He's got an ex-wife, no family to speak of, a reputation sliding down from dubious to downright bad and isn't rolling in dough but he's doing okay.  Then there's a knock at his office door (it's also his apartment and he's there rent-free, but that's another story), and the knock changes everything.</span></p>
<p>Seems there a little girl, a young woman really, lost somewhere out there.  Nothing new about that but this girl might be something special, someone that harsh realities of the darkness lurking in the world out there shouldn't be allowed to touch.  This little girl also has a rich daddy, a real rich daddy in fact, and he wants her found.  Cully's exact sort of work, and for good hard cash what could be better?  But there's a lot going on Cully doesn't know or understand; for starters, the father is not saying much, and what he does don't make a hell of a lot of sense.  He's sure she's been kidnapped, but there's no ransom.  He's desperate to find her but demands police involvement kept to the minimum.  And, by the way, just why exactly (let alone how) does a 17-year-old princess of the city who's so damn perfect get herself snatched without apparent reason or trace?</p>
<p>But money talks, and rumors abound.  </p>
<p>Cully reaches out and starts hearing things.  Disturbing things.  There's a young punk with the pretty blue eyes and the rebellious attitude all the girls seem to flock to, a low-end dope fiend with a story just might be too crazy to make up, gangsters sniffing around with smiles on their faces and brass knuckles in their fists, tales of bizarre goings-on at the outskirts on the city near the tracks, maybe near the Byzantine system of underground tunnels currently being constructed, coincidentally by the aforementioned loving and worried papa bear.  There's also some mysterious stranger who's not the romantic figure the term implies but instead a straight-up hard case, a tough guy whose motivations are unknown.  Then there's the specter of Doctor X, the unofficial name of the soul (if he has one at all) who may or may not be responsible for multiple seemingly-unconnected murders in and around the Burgh stretching back a decade or more.  If he or she or it even exists.  Is there a connection?  Is a connection even possible?  And at the center of it all is a sweet and pretty young lady, by all accounts an innocent among innocents.  </p>
<p>Cully's gonna find her.  Because he gave his word (one of the only things in this world he gives a damn about), because he took the father's money (he's an honest guy even when he ain't, and besides there's always the promise of more), but mostly because he wants to prove something.  To the father, to his friends, to the little girl, to the world, to himself.  He's out to prove neither the world nor Bill Cullinane is past redemption, beyond all hope.  Believe: dead or alive, spoiled or untouched, he's gonna find her.</p>
<p>And he just might.  But that's not all he's gonna find.  Somewhere, down the tracks, The Black Train awaits.  That right there is the problem with tracks, by the way; once you're on 'em you're on 'em, can't go left or right but only forward, and maybe when you think you're chasing something you're really only on a collision course.</p><p><br/></p><p>This book is good.  I don't mind saying it.  Not just cause it's mine but because I know good and this story's got legs.  If it gets out there, it'll sell.  It might even sell <i>huge</i>.  This is your opportunity to get in early on what I think could, with a lot of hard work and a little luck, something pretty big (in terms of pop-culture and the publishing industry anyway), so come on, jump aboard The Black Train.  The going will not be all that smooth, and some of your fellow passengers might be a little scary...or even a little dangerous...but it's gonna be one hell of a ride, one you're not gonna wanna miss.</p></div>","The Train kept a-rollin', all night long...

Everybody has the right to create, but given the imminent arrival of a manufacturing and design revolution (mass 3d printer sales, free design software), everybody needs guidance and information to this world.
I intent to include the kids, the mothers, the grandma´s, people who want to create but don´t know how, but have the itch...
With your help, i will start an educational site about design, manufacturing using 3d printing and a really simple yet effective approach to executing ideas. My objective is to teach as many people as i can to create their own things to improve their lives. 

Would you like to be part of the group that connected all this in one book and website? "" ...sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."" 
Through the Looking Glass-

angry, bitter, and depressed -- but I didn't give up. Instead, I turned to
social media for help. The support I found there, and the tools I learned how

<h2><strong>Here's my campaign:</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, my name is Bryn and I am an amateur photographer. I have been a professional photographer in the past working on weddings and doing a bit for the local newspaper on a freelance basis, but when my son came along a few years ago I gave the photographer business up and got a ‘proper job’ as my Dad would say.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I love photography and want to get myself set up to start making a living from capturing the world around me. To do this I need help.<span style="""">  </span>I sold all of my equipment a few years ago and my computer is really out of date and, basically, that is why I am starting this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My campaign is a simple photography based one. I have a set of images I took on a 9-day trip to Canada and I am going to create limited edition prints and canvases for any one who helps to raise the funds I need to get myself a new camera and computer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I achieve my goal I will be able to take up photography once more and to be able to go out and start to build a portfolio of work to further my ambition of becoming a professional photographer.<span style="""">   </span></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>I am looking for funding to buy a new camera and lens kit along with a new computer and hopefully the latest Adobe software to realise my dream.<span style="""">  </span>I’ve set a target of £2000.

I’d love to go to an Apple store and slap a wad of cash on the counter, but that might just be wishful thinking.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>What’s the book about?</h2>
<p>It’s about how you build a satisfied life.  Living well doesn’t happen randomly.  It happens when you get to the source of what turns you on in life and then you begin having the conversations, taking the actions and setting things up the way that works for your highest and biggest expression.  With this book you’ll be building, piece by piece, your satisfied life.  You’ll learn the critical importance of timing; when to deeply examine things, when to get into action and when to let go of the wheel for a while. </p>
<p>You’ll also gain a deep understanding and experience of just how the four pillars of satisfaction – healthy body, a broad range and sufficient depth of emotion, varied thought and unleashed soul are intertwined and the importance of each when it comes to true life satisfaction.</p>

<h2>What makes this book project so different?</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As far as I’m aware, no one in the self development world has yet chosen to welcome in those they are working to support to truly co-create with them an experience of growth and change.  I fully recognize that
I am not your answer.  And I've created this project to honor your inherent capacity to experience deep satisfaction
in this lifetime.</p>
<p><b>For me, the most exciting part of this project happens when you contribute at the $75 level.</b>  Why?  Because, at this level, you have a direct impact on the purpose of this campaign.  That is, to create a self development book like no other, where the material was co-created and the book was influenced by people's real life experiences in building satisfied lives.</p>
<p>At its core,
this project operates from the assumption that you already have all the innate energy
and capacity to live a satisfied life.  There are just two things missing.  1) some clarity as to what is important to cultivating your individual satisfaction; and 2) the awareness as to what committed actions you must take to bust out of whatever restrictions you
have placed on your capacity to live a deeply satisfied life.</p>

<h2>What will my contribution make possible?</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Well, there are two answers to this question.  First the practical impact.  Self publishing a book is NOT cheap.  I've spent a good deal of time with someone who has both self published and written a book for a major publisher.  So, I've been schooled on what it actually takes.  There's cover &amp; design ($3,000!), three different types of editing ($4,000!), printing ($2,500) and so much more.  And if, for some reason, I don't reach my goal, I'll be making up the difference with my own funds.  This will decrease the amount of time and energy I can put into the research and crowd sourcing and possibily delay the completion of the book itself.</p>
<p>But beyond these practical things, and truly why this campaign is so unique, is that you are making it possible for a new kind of self development book publishing model to emerge.  I'm certain that being able to engage with real people who are putting the principles of the book into action in their real lives is going to make for a book that has a deeper and more sustained impact for people than one published in the traditional, ""top down"" way.  All this engaging with people and learning from the real world application of the principles takes lots of time and effort and you will be helping to fund that.</p>

participating?</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Well, that all depends on how you
participate!  Even at the most
basic level of contribution ($15), you’ll have access to the digital version of
the book as well as ongoing access to special content for the duration of this
IndieGoGo campaign.  At $25, you’ll
have continued access to an online community where people will be interacting
and supporting one another in crafting their satisfied lives.  At $75, you’ll be able to participate
on one of the tele seminars and have access to additional detailed information
in real time as you put these principles to work in your life.  And then, there are higher levels of
contribution that afford you my personal attention, all the way up to and
including a “stay-cation” retreat in your (or my) city!</span></h4>

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">SUPPORTER - If you love the idea but are not
sure how deeply you want to be involved, you can simply contribute $15, $25 or

campaign and give you access to the book.<br/><br/></span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">ENGAGER – If there is something about this book’s
theme that calls to you, you can contribute as little as $75 to participate on a group tele-seminar or from $250 to as much as $1500
to work 1:1
with me.<br/><br/></span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">EXPANDER – There are perks that are designed

contributing to the life satisfaction of those around them.  There are two levels of contribution
for this group ($500 and $950).<br/><br/></span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">EXPLODER – Here’s the participation level that’s
being offered for just two very special people.  If you are ready to not only explore, not only engage, not

and supporting one another in crafting their satisfied lives.  At $75, you’ll be able to participate
on one of the tele seminars and have access to additional detailed information
in real time as you put these principles to work in your life.  And then, there are higher levels of
contribution that afford you my personal attention, all the way up to and
including a “stay-cation” retreat in your (or my) city!

Ok, I'm definitely in.  But I'm not sure what I'm in for!  :)



Because this project is multi-faceted and open to lots of different types of involvement, I've created a 4 part framework to help you choose how you want to be involved.  Let’s see which one fits for
you.
SUPPORTER - If you love the idea but are not
sure how deeply you want to be involved, you can simply contribute $15, $25 or
$50 and participate as a supporter of the project.  This will unlock your access to the bonus content during the
campaign and give you access to the book.
ENGAGER – If there is something about this book’s
theme that calls to you, you can contribute as little as $75 to participate on a group tele-seminar or from $250 to as much as $1500
to work 1:1
with me.
EXPANDER – There are perks that are designed
specifically for those who are wellness practitioners or are interested in
contributing to the life satisfaction of those around them.  There are two levels of contribution
for this group ($500 and $950).
EXPLODER – Here’s the participation level that’s
being offered for just two very special people.  If you are ready to not only explore, not only engage, not
only expand but to completely explode your life as it current exists and are
ready to fully embrace your birthright of living a satisfied life, take a look at the
VIP packages that are available.



""Matthew created a framework for me during a time of much soul-searching and transition in my life. With his support, I was able to get clear about my priorities and work towards my goals - both personal and professional - in a way that felt manageable and a lot less scary. Matthew's cheerful nature, willingness to listen when I needed it, and ability to propel me forward when I needed THAT instead, created an invaluable support system at a time when everything in my life was changing."" - Lara D. - Seattle, U.S.

Are there ways to contribute to the campaign beyond supporting it financially?

Of course!  I've got special gifts planned for those that share the campaign via social media channels.  All you need to do is tag me in your post so I can keep track.  Then, just keep an eye on your Facebook or Twitter inbox for your special thank you surprise!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>DrunkenWerewolf started as a blog. It shuffled around for a bit before finally moving servers to become a proper website. This is when I began to take the project more seriously, putting all my spare time into promoting the music through the site. Then I had the bright idea to start a zine, buy a domain, introduce some new writers and really shift a gear in terms of development. DrunkenWerewolf rapidly morphed from a little (cheap) fledgling into this giant sized monster of infinite capability... at least in my eyes. One day it really will be, but not without your help.</p>
<p>We’ve raised what we can, where we can, when we can through various means, but sadly I can no longer pick up all of the slack myself. Don’t worry, this isn’t a sob story. I don’t take it lightly when I say DrunkenWerewolf is my life and I will never complain about running it, ever. But it costs money, and it’s become popular enough to grow to such a proportion it’s no longer something I can fund on my own.</p>
<p>From a non selfish point of view, DrunkenWerewolf really does help the unsung artist. We’re caring and passionate about the music that we love, and we’re honest in our constructive criticism. The website and magazine also provides reportedly insightful and top notch commentary on the music industry, alongside in depth interviews with and reviews of musicians’ work. It respects the little man, whether that’s a reader or a musician, but it also makes puddles around the feet of the big man. I want it to cause a tsunami, and this campaign will help us to do that.</p>
<h2><strong>Help you how, and for what?</strong></h2>
<p>It costs a lot of money to run the magazine, and while we’ll be self-sufficient one day, we’re not there yet. This campaign is designed to raise money solely for the production of the magazine, and the maintenance of the site. Nothing else. No salaries; I know campaigning to line your own pocket is a bit naff. If we overreach our goal, the money will be put in reserve for future production. If we don’t reach our target, we will pull a sad face and you will be refunded.</p>
<p>We’re not simply asking for a donation: there’s something in it for you, too! First off, we’ve got limited edition tote bags and prints on offer alongside an annual magazine subscription.</p>
<p>We’re also putting together a yearbook featuring, offering 50 of you the chance to lend your mugs to a special article designed by our leading illustration lady Emma Hardy. That will be included in the magazine and distributed around Bristol, so brush your hair! If you’re not keen on having your photo taken, you can get an issue of the magazine dedicated specially to you or a loved one – we’ve got 12 slots going, one for each month. Feel free to pick a specific one to coincide with a birthday!</p>
<p>Plus there’s tons of other neat little things, including pins, personalised playlists and t-shirts. Sound good? Good.</p>
<h2><strong>No moneys? We understand</strong></h2>
<p>Of course if you have no money, we totally understand (been there, are there) but that’s not to say you can’t help! Just as the pen is mightier than the sword, sometimes gobbing off about something is better than giving us a quid. You never know who’s listening, after all. If you could spread the word about this campaign and DrunkenWerewolf in general, we will be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Yours hopefully,</p>

<h3>Velocity Gamer</h3>
<p>Velocity Gamer is what many people would call a 'small' gaming site. We don't rake in a whole lot of cash, and review copies don't come in when we need them. Although we have a fairly sizable dedicated reader base that comes to us for quality video game news, reviews, and editorials, the 'reviews' part needs help.</p>
<p>Our editors just can't afford all the games we need to review. We also would like to put games in the hands of editors so they can be informed come Game of the Year time. But our primary concern is having the money to buy games on launch day. That's where this campaign comes in.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How This Works:</h3>
<p>Here's how we'll use the money we get from the campaign.</p>
<p>Editors will be assigned games by the Editor-In-Chief, unless they feel they're a very strong fit for the game. They will go out, buy the game, and review it as soon as possible. Only when said review is completed will they be reimbursed for their purchase.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal of $600, then after we have at <em>least</em> one of every game in the Big Six lined up, the excess money will go towards getting a second copy of that game, so our editors know what they're talking about when it comes time to hand out Game of the Year Awards.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Big Six</h3>
<p>This is what we need to review in order to be competitive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dishonored</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed 3</li>
<li>Hitman: Absolution</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</li>
<li>Far Cry 3</li>
<li>Halo 4</li>
</ul>
<p>Any excess money will go towards reviewing Pokemon Black and White 2, Skylanders: Giants, Medal of Honor: Warfighter, Epic Mickey 2, and PlayStation All Stars Battle Royale. We'd also like to catch up on some of the games we missed, just in case there are any games we'd like to recognize at the end of the year.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>And that's it</h3>
<p>We would love you forever if you donated. Here's <a href=""http://www.velocitygamer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our site</a>, <a href=""http://www.velocitygamer.com/category/reviews/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our reviews section</a>, and <a href=""http://www.velocitygamer.com/category/podcast/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our podcast</a>. Take a look around and decide whether or not we're worth your money!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Joaquin Zihuatanejo and I am an award winning teacher and poet from Dallas, Texas.  I am asking you to help me get the six poets that make up The 2013 Dallas Youth Poets Team to the Brave New Voices Poetry Festival and Slam in Chicago this August.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Through fundraising efforts of our own we have been able to raise the funds to cover the $1,650 that is the team registration and lodging fee.  What we need is your help to purchase flights for the six team members and two coaches on Southwest Airlines.  Every penny of your donation will go toward the purchase of those flights.  Getting these six amazing students from Dallas to Chicago is an expensive endeavor.  With your help we can make it happen.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are teaching these youth poets that their voice is their power and with their voice they can write the wrongs of the world one poem at a time.  Someone once said that poetry exists to give the socially awkward a chance to finally be aplauded by their peers.  We applaud our high school quarterbacks under the Friday night lights of a footbal stadium, and we should.  But at Brave New Voices our amazing young writers and performers finally get a chance to be applauded under the stage lights of The University of Chicago and surrounding theaters.  This experience will stay with these youth poets always and you can help give it to them.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot donate please spread word about our cause through social media and through word of mouth.  And please know how grateful we are to you for reading this and spreading word about our movement.</p>

</h3><h3>Description of Project</h3>
<p>The
focus on adoption in the national arena is the cute little baby who has now
been happily adopted into his new deserving home.  Yet little is known about the women who
relinquished their babies to adoption, the women who gave birth to those cute
babies.  As a society we assume these
women are somehow bad, they are possibly ""crack whores"" or young
women who have gone wrong.  We still keep
original mothers shrouded in secrecy and shame often asking, ""who would
give away their own kid?""  When we
talk about adoption and adoptive families we do not talk about the pain that
probably exists in the life of the mother who had to walk away from her
baby.  We try to keep the reality of
""birthmothers"" hidden, out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>This
book is a collection of voices of original mothers.  There are many reasons why these women lost
their babies and their stories together tell the story of adoption in the
United States.   This
project has two major goals.  The first
is to untangle the myth of the ""Birthmother.""  There is too much myth built up around the
identity of original mothers and the world needs to hear more truths.  The second is to facilitate the telling of
these important stories .  The project
offers women a legitimate place to tell their st<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ories, some for the first time.
 I believe it will also help families to heal. Helping moms tell
their stories in open ways is healing and transforming.   Telling does not make the story go away, nor
does it remove the trauma, but  it helps
one to understand and forgive and gain a new identity, ""the teeth"" of
the tragic event have been removed.   </span></p>
<p>The only way to heal a hurt is to give voice to what ails
us.  It is only in this way that we can
keep our pain and loss from taking root inside us.  It is only in this way that we have a chance
for freedom.  Desmund Tutu (97)</p>
<p>In this
collection you will meet women like Vicki, Cathi, Fritz and Haley. Vicki's
story is painful to hear, as a 19 year old she tried her hardest to do the
right thing by her infant son and her step children.  She was left to mother five children with
little support.  Pressure placed upon her
by partners and a state agency drove her to give up and try to kill
herself.  Instead of providing support
and a little know how, instead of offering a place where she could learn to
parent, find resources, gain a sense of self confidence, she was harangued
until she finally signed over her rights. 
Sixteen years later her eldest son found her again in order to remove
himself from an abusive adoptive mother.</p>
<p>Cathi was
raped at 14, and according to her mother, that was her fault.  Fritz found herself pregnant at 20 in a
relationship and very aware that they had too many needs of their own to be
good parents, yet.  She grew up with a
mentally ill Mom, she knew what bad parenting was like, she intentionally
researched and found what looked like an ideal adoptive situation for her to
surrender, yet it was not an easy process. And Haley's story is quite different
and as she says in some ways the happy ever after adoption story.  Even so it outlines the on-going pain that
surrounds losing a baby.</p>
<p>A third
unplanned benefit is that reading the stories in total offers a new
understanding of the history of adoption over the past seventy years.  Seen in chronological order one has a window into
the ways policy and society dictated adoption and maintained shame. </p>
<p>It is rare
for the voices of original mothers to be collected and shared.  Ann Fessler in 2006 pioneered the collecting
of this unique population's stories, a few have followed.  This one will  show the history of adoption over the past 70
years and how adoption has effected society over the years.  Giving
a baby to adoption is not the courageous selfless action of a ""drug addict
whore.""  It is a complicated
decision made by women who are under stress and being pressured from many
different directions.  It is a heart
wrenching event in both mother and baby's lives no matter when in history it
happened.</p>
<p>Adoption
continues to be riddled with stories of trauma and coercion.  It is necessary for the truth to be clearly
stated.  It is important for society to
honor the stories of original mothers.  This book's intention is to paint that
picture, to allow women to tell their stories and for the public to get beyond
the rhetoric of adoption.</p>
<p>The oldest
woman in this collection just turned 80. 
She was born in 1935 and relinquished her child in 1955 at birth.  The youngest woman in this collection is
27.  She relinquished in 2005.  Their stories are very different, yet they
contain some similar variables.  All of
these stories describe the brokenness that walking away from one's own baby
produces.  Different women refer to this
""brokenness"" in different ways. 
</p>
<p>Nancy
describes the endless wondering, the fact that she never stopped worrying about
and wanting to know if her daughter was searching for her, needed her.</p>
<p>Pam
describes;  My
life up to that point had been secure and stable and predictable.  And after David, it was not secure, it was
not stable and any predictability was just what I brought to it.</p>
<p>Meg states,
""It is a daily struggle to try to get the birth into some kind of
perspective and achieve some normalcy in my life, especially since there are so
many complex and diverse emotions in play from anger, both at myself and
others, to guilt.""</p>
<p>The belief
was that they would just get over it;  it
was best for mother and baby to be separated as quickly and with as little
interaction as possible and they would both ""move on.""  Not one of the women I interviewed, no matter
what her circumstances were, have described any of the experience as just
moving on.  This is a myth of
relinquishment and it has been maintained for many years.  In this collection of interviews they are all
in agreement,  no one just moved on.</p>
<p>For Pam
there was always a ""Kind of alien disconnect.""  A big deep dark secret that hovered in the
background of all decisions; she never felt quite stable in her life.  Fritz says, ""First few years were the
toughest.  I was distracted,
suicidal...""  Cathi expresses her
sadness and her regret which maintains to this day.  </p>
<p>The idea
that ""you would forget"" was an horrendous lie and all thought
something was intrinsically  wrong with
them because they were not forgetting the baby or the birth, or they had no
memories of the experiences, a total black out around it.</p>
<p>Adoption has
gone through a slow change and continues to change.  Presently there are original mothers and
adoptees who feel adoption should be illegal, that it is society consciously
causing trauma to a mother and a child. 
Others feel adoption can be an option if handled with care, but none of
the women in this collection buy into the idea that"" adoption is a
beautiful courageous thing.""  It
maybe a last resort, an important option for some people, but policies
surrounding it need to be revamped considerably and money needs to be funneled
into helping women and men learn how to parent. 
This book will help to illuminate some of the issues that are so
important to a large portion of our population.</p>
<p>Often I get
asked why I believe I am the right person to take on this project.  To begin with I am an original mother.  I relinquished my daughter when I was 19 in
1972.  My own story will be included in
the book .  I know what it feels like to
be broken and to learn to live my life with relinquishment as a part of the
components that make up me, a part of my identity.</p>
<p>I am a
writer and a photographer.  I have the
skills needed to complete this project  I
am an experienced interviewer and 
researcher and have read extensively in the field of adoption.</p>
<p>I am also
passionate about this project and have dedicated my life to if for the past
nine months.  I have submerged myself in

<p>Description
of Process</p>
<p>1. Over the
past nine months I have interviewed over fifteen women who have relinquished a
baby to adoption.  The women I have interviewed
have ranged from ages 27-80.  They have
relinquished between the ages of 14 and 23. I have 3 more interviews lined up.  These interviews, with the exception of two,
have been done over the phone.  The
interviewee were sent the questions prior to the interview call.  I tried to connect by phone with each person
to talk to them and answer any questions about the process.  </p>
<p>2. Each
story is being written up based on the interviews drawing from each woman's
voice with the goal of maintaining the individual voices.  I have written a third of the stories, thus
far.  After the first draft is completed
each woman will receive her story in order to provide feedback and make any
changes they see as important.</p>
<p>3. Thus far I have
interviewed everyone over the phone with the exception of the two who live near
me.  I think it is essential to meet each
woman and to add portraits and illustrations to the book.  My vision of the completed project includes
story, voices and photos and helps to define adoption from the perspective of
original mothers.  To do this I need to
make 2 trips, one across from the east coast to the west coast and one down the
east coast.  After completing the first
drafts of all of the stories by the end of September, I would like to spend
from the middle of October to the middle of November on the road. During one of
the trips I would like to attend the CUB* conference retreat  in Carlsbad, Ca.. ( *CUB is a national
association for concerned birthparents. 
This is the annual national meeting of the association.)</p>
<p>At each stop
I foresee each woman able to have input on her own story, on the text of her
story: to make suggestions for illustrations, memorabilia, old photos one might

<br/></div>","Description of Project
The
focus on adoption in the national arena is the cute little baby who has now
been happily adopted into his new deserving home.  Yet little is known about the women who
relinquished their babies to adoption, the women who gave birth to those cute
babies.  As a society we assume these
women are somehow bad, they are possibly ""crack whores"" or young
women who have gone wrong.  We still keep
original mothers shrouded in secrecy and shame often asking, ""who would
give away their own kid?""  When we
talk about adoption and adoptive families we do not talk about the pain that
probably exists in the life of the mother who had to walk away from her
baby.  We try to keep the reality of
""birthmothers"" hidden, out of sight, out of mind.
This
book is a collection of voices of original mothers.  There are many reasons why these women lost
their babies and their stories together tell the story of adoption in the
United States.   This
project has two major goals.  The first
is to untangle the myth of the ""Birthmother.""  There is too much myth built up around the
identity of original mothers and the world needs to hear more truths.  The second is to facilitate the telling of
these important stories .  The project
offers women a legitimate place to tell their stories, some for the first time.
 I believe it will also help families to heal. Helping moms tell
their stories in open ways is healing and transforming.   Telling does not make the story go away, nor
does it remove the trauma, but  it helps
one to understand and forgive and gain a new identity, ""the teeth"" of
the tragic event have been removed.   
The only way to heal a hurt is to give voice to what ails
us.  It is only in this way that we can
keep our pain and loss from taking root inside us.  It is only in this way that we have a chance
for freedom.  Desmund Tutu (97)

seller for 48 hours on Amazon in the category of Memoirs of Entertainers. I 
have been resisting the idea of hitting you up again for more donations but who am I 
to deny the generous? Now my boomer readers who are practically blind from aging are 
asking for an audio book too. So I plan on using a portion of these 
funds to produce the audio book of My Life a Four Letter 
Word for the visually and mentally impaired. Just like my once glorious double D’s, my first book sales are sagging a bit but that doesn’t mean I’ve 
been resting on my laurels. I

</div><div>
<br/><b>Here is what our DMV contributors have to say:</b><p><i>Being on the work force of a magazine requires dedication. Be prepared to give time, it will be very worthwhile. With LGM, I have written book reviews, interviewed authors, written poetry (poetry! I didn't even know I liked poetry), and seen the behind-the-scenes work of publishing a magazine. LGM has opportunities to connect with people, expand one's literary horizons, and discover unrecognized talents. The time I've spent with LGM has been an amazing learning experience. </i>                                                      <b>                    - Rachel, high school senior</b></p>
<p><i>LGM
has taught me to love who I am. There is no limit or
boundary to where and who you can be. I've met so many inspiring young women that give me motivation. Inspiration has no age; Jasmine Babers, who is the creator of LGM and one year younger than me, is amazing.</i></p>
<p><i>I was one of the cover model's and spokes person of the first issue
of the D.C. issue. Also, I had the opportunity to attend the 2014 Love,
Awards in Illinois because of LGM. These experiences <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">changed me by giving me more drive for life. Everything that I've learned from LGM
and the people involved had an incredible, positive toll on me. I've
become more confident in what I believe and want to achieve for my life goals. I plan on being apart of the LGM team as long as I am able
to. I want to
inspire young women to be individualistic and leaders of their
generation. I know that sharing my relatable story in life and with the LGM
family will inspire many young and even older women to achieve the impossible. </span></i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>                                                                             - </i><b>Keona, Premiere Issue Cover Girl</b></span></p>Your contribution will help us build stronger, more confident girls - one story at a time.
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p> Our biggest challenge is that we are a free magazine and want to stay that way. Our girls are passionate about writing and making a positive impact. We risk disappointing them if we don't make our goal.</p>
<p>The risk for us is working so hard and pushing the girls then we don't publish the magazine. Our commitment is driven by the girls who put so much energy and time into making the magazine a success.  Every thing we do and all funds collected will support that effort and commitment. </p>
<p>We do risk losing that 
opportunity if our funding efforts aren't successful. </p>

metro area. LGM is designed to help teenage girls build
self-esteem, become leaders, and pursue their dreams.The DC magazine has impacted almost 10,000 girls. 
The DMV Edition launched January 2014 and has engaged thousands of girls across the tri-state area. We plan to do it bigger and better in Georgia! Some major DMV accomplishments:- Engaged over 25 girls that are now published journalists and/or artists- Spring 2014 Cover girl, Gabrielle Jordan, was selected as the 365 Black Award Youth recipient- Hosted our inaugural DC Love Awards recognizing four outstanding girls in the areas of Performing Arts (Kamerin Harris), Entrepreneurship (Danette Makaila), Community Service (Lauryn Boucree), and Leadership (Layla Fawaz). DC Grammy Association Board of Trustees member, Deborah Bond, served as the Host Committee Chair.

Help us start a success list for the GA Edition and contribute today!

Here is what our DMV contributors have to say:Being on the work force of a magazine requires dedication. Be prepared to give time, it will be very worthwhile. With LGM, I have written book reviews, interviewed authors, written poetry (poetry! I didn't even know I liked poetry), and seen the behind-the-scenes work of publishing a magazine. LGM has opportunities to connect with people, expand one's literary horizons, and discover unrecognized talents. The time I've spent with LGM has been an amazing learning experience.                                                                           - Rachel, high school senior
LGM
has taught me to love who I am. There is no limit or
boundary to where and who you can be. I've met so many inspiring young women that give me motivation. Inspiration has no age; Jasmine Babers, who is the creator of LGM and one year younger than me, is amazing.
I was one of the cover model's and spokes person of the first issue
of the D.C. issue. Also, I had the opportunity to attend the 2014 Love,
Awards in Illinois because of LGM. These experiences changed me by giving me more drive for life. Everything that I've learned from LGM
and the people involved had an incredible, positive toll on me. I've
become more confident in what I believe and want to achieve for my life goals. I plan on being apart of the LGM team as long as I am able
to. I want to
inspire young women to be individualistic and leaders of their
generation. I know that sharing my relatable story in life and with the LGM
family will inspire many young and even older women to achieve the impossible. 
                                                                             - Keona, Premiere Issue Cover GirlYour contribution will help us build stronger, more confident girls - one story at a time.
  Risks & Challenges  
 Our biggest challenge is that we are a free magazine and want to stay that way. Our girls are passionate about writing and making a positive impact. We risk disappointing them if we don't make our goal.
The risk for us is working so hard and pushing the girls then we don't publish the magazine. Our commitment is driven by the girls who put so much energy and time into making the magazine a success.  Every thing we do and all funds collected will support that effort and commitment. 
We do risk losing that 
opportunity if our funding efforts aren't successful.

</p><p>Hi, my name is Pauch Khiev. I am the author of Purging Innocence. I
was born in Cambodia during a horrific time in history. I was barely one year old and still
breastfeeding when the Khmer Rouge tore me from my parents who were
forced into hard labor. I was left alone with two older sisters, one a 5 year old
and the other barely 8 years of age. Mystically, a beautiful <b>LEOPARD</b> appeared
nightly to sleep under our stilt house as if it was sent from heaven to be our
guardian angel. I emigrated to the United States with my family in 1981.

</div></div>","My Story
When I was a little girl I used to think I would grow up to become an artist.  I believed I would one day wow the world with my doodles and colored designs!  This fantasy, of course, was fueled by winning a Safeway coloring contest when I was ten.  Walking into the store to receive my reward--knowing I'd come in first place!--was the start of something big!  Just so happens, it was the same year I discovered I could write.

Turns out I had a gift, or so my fifth grade teacher told my parents on Parent/Teacher Conference Night.  Should this have come as a surprise?  Probably not, but boy was I glad to hear it!  For my gift gave reason for my constant daydreaming.  It explained my incessant need to direct play dates with my cousins. Cut! Listen guys, it's not working. Where's the drama? The suspense? When I say ""..."" you should say ""...,"" and put some feeling behind it.  Now let's take it from the top!

To hear I had a gift changed my life, and my ambitions.  Book signings.  The New York Times Best-Sellers list.  An Oscar Nomination.  A Pulitzer Prize in Fiction.  These weren't just dreams.  They became my expectation for greatness; an indication of the success that lied within me.  But somewhere along the way I began to lose hope, to question myself and believe the lies.  I asked myself, Who am I to be worthy of such a gift?

It wasn't until I met the man in my dreams that I began to feel worthy, intelligent and capable of achieving the so-called impossible.  So if you have ever questioned yourself or your talent, then my heart goes out to you.  I know what it's like.  But it doesn't have to be this way.  No one, not even you, should ever feel or be made to feel unworthy of their gift.  And while these doubts know no gender--as a woman and founder of Her Nation--the her inside of me cannot allow the her inside of you to believe another lie.  We are far too precious to hide our light from the world.


The Impact
Nearly six months ago, I sat down at my computer and began to write a blog. I'll be honest with you. The idea of blogging used to scare me.  I mean, what was I going to say?  What did I need to say?  And, why would anyone care to read it?  But to my surprise, I knew exactly what I was going to say and why I needed to say it.  I was so excited, I was willing to share how I became my her with anyone who would take the time and read.  Little did I know the blog would reach 27 other countries in a matter of weeks.  With just the same interest, I began to receive posts on my Facebook Page from women in other states and countries, each believing they were alone in their quest to become their her.  Suddenly I was not alone.  I was not the only one.

Can you imagine?  Have I just discovered my purpose?  When what I'm gifted to do aligns with my passion to help others?

Even within my own network of friends, I began to ask, ""Do you have a her?""  It took six months and an embarrassing amount of tears to write, When I Am Her.  Not only because of its content but because I knew--for the first time in my life I really knew--that this wasn't just about me.  This was about a nation of women.  A Her Nation.

The impact?  I've witnessed firsthand how much a woman can overcome when she discovers the her within.  There is courage, strength, passion and a sense of worth that cannot be tainted or taken away.

My hope is BIG and asking for help (especially when it pertains to money) doesn't come easy for me.  But I cannot make this a Her Nation alone.  I will plant the seed.  I will hold their hand.  I will hug them when they cry.  And I will stand with them when they are weak.  But I need you.  I need your support.

What We Need & What You Get

To be fully funded would mean I could print 2000 copies of When I Am Her and work on getting the book into independent bookstores and universities world-wide.  So long as I'm dreaming BIG, I will continue to pursue other outlets, such as Starbucks, Costco and Target.  But I won't stop there.  Your contribution will help market and promote the book (via our website, Facebook, Twitter, etc), create branding materials (such as apparel and stationery) and make workshops available to women incarcerated and/or suffering from abuse.



Most importantly, you don't have to be a woman to help.  Turns out we all have a mother, sister, or friend who could use a lil' her pick me up, every now and then.  And to show my gratitude, I've created some rather nice perks.  Especially with New Year's Resolutions right around the corner!  So take a look and know you're not just making my dream come true.  You're helping another woman discover their her and show the world what she is made of!


Please note:
* To print 2,000 copies of the book has an early eta of January 2012.
* All perks include UPS Ground shipping within the United States.
* For interest outside the US, please email Her Nation at: info@thehernation.com

* If I am not fully funded I will use the funds raised to continue my efforts in making this a Her Nation.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Los Feedlebag</strong> te adentrará en el espectacular paisaje de Los Picos de Europa... en compañía de unos seres misteriosos, que te verán aunque tú no los veas a ellos.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ana y los gemelos Pedro y Lolo se dirigen a un campamento de verano en Los Picos de Europa. Allí nada es como esperaban. A Ana le toca compartir cabaña con “La vampiresa” y dos chicas más con las que no tiene nada en común. El único que le gusta desde un principio es Marcos, el monitor, guapo y simpático, quien les cuenta la increíble historia de Los Feedlebag. Aunque muy escépticos al comienzo de la narración, pronto descubrirán que hay más de verdad de lo que parecía.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nuestra protagonista siempre supo que su llegada al mundo tenía un propósito, un sentido, en esta aventura lo descubrirá por fin, se convertirá en el viaje de su vida y conocerá por primera vez el amor. Eso sí, nada es lo que parece en un principio.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Beatriz Cerón Morales</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacida en Málaga en 1974, donde se licenció en Filología Inglesa, también tiene estudios de Filología Hispánica y en la actualidad trabaja como profesora de Lengua y Literatura en un instituto de secundaria. Ha sido finalista en numerosos certámenes y ha obtenido algunos premios literarios entre los que destacaríamos el Primer Accésit en la XXVI edición del <i>Premio Joaquín Lobato</i> con el poemario <i>Máscaras, músicas, mares y juegos</i> y el Primer premio del <i>XV certamen de poesía Victoria Kent</i> con el poema Versos blasfemos. <i>Los Feedlebag</i> es su primera novela juvenil.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Tal y como anuncia en su blog <a href=""http://vitaenverso.blogspot.com.es"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vitaenverso.blogspot.com.es</a> su bisabuelo era encuadernador y siempre ha imaginado que este hecho marcó que las letras corrieran por sus venas y se tomase la vida en verso.</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 800€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>

</div></div>","¿Qué?
Los Feedlebag te adentrará en el espectacular paisaje de Los Picos de Europa... en compañía de unos seres misteriosos, que te verán aunque tú no los veas a ellos.
Ana y los gemelos Pedro y Lolo se dirigen a un campamento de verano en Los Picos de Europa. Allí nada es como esperaban. A Ana le toca compartir cabaña con “La vampiresa” y dos chicas más con las que no tiene nada en común. El único que le gusta desde un principio es Marcos, el monitor, guapo y simpático, quien les cuenta la increíble historia de Los Feedlebag. Aunque muy escépticos al comienzo de la narración, pronto descubrirán que hay más de verdad de lo que parecía.
Nuestra protagonista siempre supo que su llegada al mundo tenía un propósito, un sentido, en esta aventura lo descubrirá por fin, se convertirá en el viaje de su vida y conocerá por primera vez el amor. Eso sí, nada es lo que parece en un principio.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a Beatriz Cerón Morales.
Nacida en Málaga en 1974, donde se licenció en Filología Inglesa, también tiene estudios de Filología Hispánica y en la actualidad trabaja como profesora de Lengua y Literatura en un instituto de secundaria. Ha sido finalista en numerosos certámenes y ha obtenido algunos premios literarios entre los que destacaríamos el Primer Accésit en la XXVI edición del Premio Joaquín Lobato con el poemario Máscaras, músicas, mares y juegos y el Primer premio del XV certamen de poesía Victoria Kent con el poema Versos blasfemos. Los Feedlebag es su primera novela juvenil.
Tal y como anuncia en su blog vitaenverso.blogspot.com.es su bisabuelo era encuadernador y siempre ha imaginado que este hecho marcó que las letras corrieran por sus venas y se tomase la vida en verso.
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 800€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Los Feedlebag que saldría después a la venta.

Want to donate $0? You still get two books! But one would make me a bit more happy.  Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word about this project and contact me with VERIFIABLE information about brony conventions if you worked behind the scenes of them. You'll be credited if your information is proven accurate and featured in my book.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>We are Dougald Hine and Paul Kingsnorth, the initiators of the Dark Mountain Project.</p>
<p>Last year, with your help, we raised $6,140 to cover the publishing costs of Dark Mountain: Issue 1, our first book-length collection of essays, stories, poetry, conversations and art for living through times of global disruption.</p>
<p>A year later, we are in the final stages of putting together Issue 2. Once again, it will be a hardback book of around 250 pages, with contributions from writers ranging from familiar names to those appearing in print for the first time.</p>
<p>We've been blown away by the response to the first book. Looking at the drafts of Issue 2, we're excited at bringing together something which continues and deepens the conversation, moving closer to the texture of people's lives and out into the wilder edges of the kind of ""Uncivilised"" writing we called for in our manifesto.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>Writing featured in Issue 2 will include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Naomi Klein on the story of endless growth;</li>
<li>extracts from Jay Griffith's new novel about the life of Frida Kahlo and Melanie Challenger's forthcoming book on extinction and the modern mind;</li>
<li>new poetry from Mario Petrucci and Heathcote Williams;</li>
<li>fiction from Nick Hunt, Simon Lys and Antonio Dias;</li>
<li>a Canadian farmer's reflections on place and belonging;</li>
<li>a rehabilitation of the Luddites on the 200th anniversary of their rising against the Machine;</li>
<li>a conversation with the poet Glyn Hughes;</li>
<li>Matt Szabo's dissection of the dead language of ""sustainability"";</li>
<li>and a recipe for Black Isle pheasant stew.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<p>There's also photography, woodcuts, illuminated poetry and free tracks from 'Dark Mountain Music', an EP by Australian band The General Assembly.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Dark Mountain Project does not receive any external funding. As with Issue 1, we are working with Christian Brett at Bracketpress to design and publish the book. To cover his work and the publication costs, we are looking to raise £3,000 ($5,000) through pre-orders between now and the end of May.</p>
<p>This is not a call for donations - everyone who contributes will get a copy of the book as soon as it's published. For $25, we'll send a copy to you, wherever you are in the world. For $50, it will be a signed copy. And anyone who can pledge $100 will get a signed copy and have their name included in the roll of honour in the back of this issue.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're grateful for any help you can give us in spreading the word about the book.</p>

<p>Hi there! My name is Gary. I am trying to accomplish a dream. Two, actually. My plan </p>
<p>is to set up an affordable off grid home and writing about the successes and failures in </p>
<p>doing so. My hope is that someone just starting out finds this info useful and even</p>
<p>improves my ideas. The ""House In A Box"" idea is not a new concept. People have used</p>
<p>everything from covered wagons to campers as a house. People are ordering portable</p>
<p>buildings (large, strong sheds), running electrical wire to tie in to ""the grid"", and run</p>
<p>into delays with permits, inspections, septic system tests... the whole 9. </p>

<li>I already have the land and have tested the basic premise of living ""off grid"" by moving an aged camper to the site, so it is do-able. I have also schooled myself in the power systems for this project. What I need is $7500 to get the ball rolling. That is $1700 to have the Cabin set on site, $1400 for septic permits and tank and $2000 to have a land evaluation done and tap a well rather than joining ""city water"". The remainder would cover unseen costs and materials needed for the written part of the project.</li>
<li>
<p>I am planning a blog so you all can follow the progress. If I should decide to make it a subscriber only blog, all donors will have access, meaning you will be able to read. Donations from $15 to $25 will be able to interact and ask questions or make suggestions. Donations $26 and up get an acknowledgement in my planned book in addition to all the above and a digital copy of the book. Any donations over a hundred dollars, I have not given much thought to, but would be willing to engage in personal correspondance to work some suitable arrangement.</p>

<p>When I first started this project in 1997, this country had not yet invaded Iraq or Afghanistan. The devastating effects of bringing young men home in caskets had not been felt here for at least a generation. In addition to the thousands killed, more than 50,000 soldiers have returned home with injuries, many disabled, unable ever to work again. This frustrating effort has brought the issue of war and its inevitable losses back into focus. My book will highlight how the loss of just one soldier can reverberate through not only the current generation of the missing one’s family but potentially through the next generation as well. I didn’t start this book as an antiwar project. I started it simply to try to better understand my parents and their war. But I realize now that What There Was Not To Tell is, in its essence, an antiwar story. I want so much to bring this story to the broader public. But I need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT ME:</h3>
<p>My first book, <em>The Place He Made,</em> was published by Random House in 1995. It is the story of my husband who died of cancer at the age of 39. <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> called it, “a triumph of the human spirit…may take its place among the best of the literature.” Though the book sold well (50,000 in hardcover and paper), I was subsequently “orphaned” by my publisher and the resulting chaos was hard for me to deal with. Ultimately, I made the choice to produce my own books, feeling I could deal directly with my readers more successfully than I could through publisher or agent. As a result, since 2005, I’ve published three more books, each one selling online and by mail at least 5,000 copies.</p>
<p>I am a self-supporting, single woman who exists on free-lance income. I have spent at least five years (cumulative) creating this book but cannot afford to spend any more time on it without help.</p>

<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm J.A. Toney. My friends call me Aaron. I'm a father of four, working man, and author. Being a dad is my most important and favorite job!</div>
<div>My campaign here is to raise money to properly publish my book <i>Gabriel; Sinner.</i> It is completely written and publish-ready. It's important to me to get it out there because I have a story to tell. It's also important to me because I want to show my children first hand that you really can accomplish anything you set your mind to. I tell them that all the time, it's time to show them!</div>
<div>By contributing to my campaign, you will be helping to share an amazing story of hope and love with a world that desperately needs both. You will also be a part of showing the world, not just my children, that we really accomplish our dreams. On top of that, you will be a part of a community that shows the world that people really do care about each other, and want to help each other succeed.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So, the nitty gritty...and the cool stuff!</div>
<div>I'm trying to raise $10,000. Here's the breakdown:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>$3500 plus tax, so about $3800, to publish through Westbow Press.</li>
<li>$3000 to cover the perks and shipping to contributors.</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">$3000 to start a marketing campaign to get the word out.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>So the cost of publishing is set in stone. However, depending on which perks are chosen most, the cost of perks could go down. With that in mind, any extra funds will be applied to the marketing campaign or uprgrading the publishing package.</div>
<div>What are the perks? I'm glad you asked! I think you're going to like this! Everyone gets a copy of the novel in ebook format. From there, depending on the level of contribution, you can get a signed hardcover or paperback, original 10 x 13 artwork inspired by the book, original postersize artwork inspired by the book, a t-shirt with the book artwork, and/or a phone call from me to discuss writing, the book, or pretty much whatever you'd like to talk about!</div>
<div><br/></div> <p><b>THE BACKUP PLAN</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>If for some reason we don't reach the goal, all of the funds that are raised will go toward publishing cost, and perks will likely not be sent. If we don't raise enough for that, then it will all go into an account and be held until there is enough to cover the cost of publishing. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><br/></div> <p>This story is one that everyone can relate to. You will come away from it entertained, and encouraged. Everyone who has read it thus far has felt as though it helped them with their everyday struggles and perspective. </p>

I'm Dan Bannino, an Italian based photographer and dog lover. 
Almost a year ago, I've rescued my dog Rothko from a shelter and from that day on my life changed.Rothko was found in a gypsy camp, in very poor state and after his adoption I've realized how many dogs are in the same condition all around the world and how a single adoption could change their lives and help supporting the situation in a dog shelter.His story is just one of a millions and so I've decided to give voice to Rothko and all his four legged friends.We'd like to share with you their stories and we are hoping to spread the idea of people finally adopting dogs, instead of buying them.
#POETICDOGS, is a photo-project where dogs are besides famous writers: speaking through their expressions, sounds and movements, they're telling you everything saying nothing, just like an author would do with words in a fine poem.



Most of these dogs suffered hunger, sickness, loneliness and are still giving their blessings to every human being they see, in the same way a lot of great artists did in the past, leaving us the treasure and legacy of their rare art. 
The goal is to feature as many wonderful rescued dog as possible, raising awareness toward shelters' adoption.
Where the Money is Going
With your support, reaching our fixed €6.000 target, in the new year we will be able to visit more dogs, sharing more stories and help finance our friends with medical, food and other basic supplies.





Since printing a book is an expensive business, only by reaching our target of €6.000 we will produce by May 2015 the first edition of the book that will feature all their amazing stories.  

Read full dog's stories and receive daily updates on Instagram and Facebook.
Support our campaign and please don't forget to share on your Twitter and Facebook page this project, every little help counts!

<p>I am working on raising $5,000 to get a psychiatric service dog (PSD) - see my story below for more details. Please consider chipping in and/or spreading the word to friends - I am so thankful for your witness and support.</p>
<p>With gratitude,<br/>Julia<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>My story<br/><br/></strong>Something most people notice about me right away is that I'm physically disabled - I was diagnosed with a type of muscular dystrophy and hearing loss at birth - and so when I received a diagnosis of major depression, anxiety, and PTSD in my early 20s it was hard to accept the fact that my mind, in addition to my body, was impaired. <br/><br/> But as I've journeyed forward into this reality, I am learning of the powerful relief that comes with admitting to myself when I am really exhausted and in need of help and support. As one of my favorite poets Sonya Renee says, ""sometimes the biggest gift you can give yourself is to let go and let yourself fall apart.""<br/><br/><strong>Falling apart</strong></p>
<p>I have been in the process of ""falling apart"" for several years now, and it has been frightening and full of unknowns, but has also allowed me to start healing. After years of apologizing for my pain and trying to hide the intense struggle of living with undiagnosed anxiety and depression, I have begun the slow, excruciating process of learning to love myself enough to ask for help when I need it. </p>
<p><strong>Hungry my whole life</strong></p>
<p>I remember sometime within the past two years, I heard about Psychiatric Service Dogs, or PSDs<ins cite=""mailto:Julia%20Sanders"" datetime=""2013-06-11T14:32"">,</ins> for the first time. I've always known about service dogs who help people who are blind or otherwise physically impaired - I still remember watching a classic Sesame Street segment that told the story of a little girl whose family helped to raise puppies for seeing-eye-dog training - but I had never heard of a service dog for mental health support. ""W<ins cite=""mailto:Peter%20Dull"" datetime=""2013-06-11T11:21""></ins>hat do they do?” I wondered. ""Why have I never heard about this before?""<ins cite=""mailto:Peter%20Dull"" datetime=""2013-06-11T11:21""></ins></p>
<p>When I first began reading about PSDs – who are trained in specific tasks to assist people living with mental illness – I was stunned at how intensely I connected with the thought of getting one. I remember telling a friend, ""I feel like I've been hungry my whole life and have just discovered food for the first time."" </p>
<p>Fearing that I might be getting swept up in an impossible idea, I did my best to keep myself grounded by reading about PSDs:<ins cite=""mailto:Peter%20Dull"" datetime=""2013-06-11T11:22""></ins> researching dog breeds, PSD programs, costs, and everything else in between. </p>
<p><strong>Finding the right program</strong></p>
<p>It has been over a year since I started that process of researching and learning everything I could about PSDs, and I am so excited to have finally connected with Crystal Callahan and her organization, <a href=""http://www.psdregistry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""PSD Registry"">PSD Registry.</a><br/><br/>This seems like a great match for my needs, and I am so lucky to have the chance to work with them. My service dog will be able to help me with many aspects of daily life, from reminding me to take medication to helping me find a safe place to recover when I'm having a panic attack.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning about the many different tasks that PSDs can be trained perform in order to help their owners with day to day functioning, check out the <span style=""font-family: Arial;""><a href=""http://www.iaadp.org/psd_tasks.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">International Association of Assistance Dog Partners (IAADP) list of service dog tasks for psychiatric disabilities.</a> <br/><br/>I also highly recommend taking the time to watch this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUH3coIL7_k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">in-depth description of PSDs, from Mental Health Matters</a>.<br/></span></p>
<p><strong>Will you join me?</strong><br/><br/> Getting a PSD is one of the scariest, most important things I could ever dream of doing for myself, to help myself cope on a daily basis as I continue the slow process of processing trauma from my past and learning how to feel safe and grounded in the present. </p>

<h3>About New Bedlam and our Goal</h3>
<p>New Bedlam began as an off-hand joke in editor Jodi Lee's family. Through many experiences within her imagination, New Bedlam eventually took root as a small town in the middle of - somewhere - where writers and residents alike were tormented by the darkness within their souls. The darkness fought for release and now the monsters are real.</p>
<p>In early 2006, Jodi Lee and fellow founding members discussed what goes on in the depths of a writer’s mind when they are afflicted – perhaps <em>blessed</em> – with insomnia. Within days Jodi had outlined a proposal for an anthology set in the nearly-fictional town of New Bedlam, and by the end of the year the wheels had been set in motion. <em>Courting Morpheus</em> was finally published in 2010 through Belfire Press, one full year after <em>The New Bedlam Project</em> launched in April of 2009.</p>
<p>For two years, <em>The New Bedlam Project</em> survived as a free-to-read, blog-based webzine. TNBP is a paying market, registered with both Ralan.com and Duotrope.com, supported by small ads and donations. Some of horror and sci-fantasy’s most promising up and coming writers have been spotted on the streets of New Bedlam, possibly looking for a way out, or perhaps they seek Morpheus, ready to bribe him for just a few moments of sleep.</p>
<p>From a candle’s reflection in the mirror, to the darkest corners of imagination, New Bedlam has grown to encompass far more than anyone ever dreamed of. The monsters have definitely escaped their bounds, and the writers may never sleep again.</p>
<p><em>Even Morpheus dares not walk these streets alone…</em></p>

Technical Support Policies and Procedures
Practical Examples (Monthly Maintenance, Backup and Disaster Recovery, and more)


Almost every consultant I talk to or coach has the same issues: They need better procedures. They need better processes. They are too busy to create this stuff from scratch. Key pieces of knowledge are in one person's head (often the owner). That ties the owner to the company and limits growth. It also makes the owner the choke-point for everything in the organization.
This four-book set will be over 600 pages and cover everything you need to set up, run, and fine-tune a great consulting business. 
Don't Start From Scratch! You may not implement everything exactly as I lay it out, but I discuss the issues and why you might create one policy or another. Then I propose some policies you can take and mold to fit your company.
Can you do all this yourself? Absolutely!
How's that working so far? 
These books will save you hundreds - and more likely thousands - of dollars in just a few weeks. Time and time again I've helped businesses create small changes that resulted in huge instant increases in profit.

<p>Kitty Karma Goes Global!</p>
<p>We know there are cat lovers (and cat slaves) everywhere around the world who want to do good – not just for the cats they love, but for all cats. Especially for the ones in need. Crowdfunding gives all you cat-loving supporters a chance to get behind a cause we can all be proud of.</p>
<p>I have launched this campaign as I need some help covering the costs of design, production and distribution to get the book out to the public. The sooner the book is in the hands of readers around the world, the faster we can generate net proceeds from book sales to help our three cat shelters.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506706638/w7dvbftalzw2sy6fhxwn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A life graced by a cat is changed forever. All the stories in this book explore their inexplicable bond with us and besides, cats are endlessly amusing and entertaining. But cats need our help. There is over-crowding in shelters, ferals are multiplying,  there is cat abuse and cruel practices in kill shelters. This book seeks to entertain as well as raise awareness so we can do better by the cats who love us unconditionally.</p>
<p>Book Details:</p>
<p>6"" X 9""</p>
<p>28 stories, 25 chapters</p>
<p>300+ pages with original photographs in black and white.</p>

<p>Firstly, why a book as a way to raise donations to these cat charities? I view that a book has a longer shelf-life and a wider demand base than a T-shirt. It has the potential for a long-running inflow of revenues, and from those revenues, a sustainable stream of donations to the cat charities. </p>
<p>We have stories that will appeal to cat-lovers and animal lovers that we can distribute around the world. As long as there is demand for the book, there will be net proceeds to donate to these charities. Plus, we are also seeking to raise awareness to the shadow aspects of the cat world - cat abuse, thoughtless cat surrenders and cruel practices at kill shelters - which are ordinarily overlooked or ignored.</p>
<p>We need funding to:</p>
<p>1.Get the book into the hands of the public. We need the start-up costs for production, design, printing, fulfillment and distribution.  To get a book that will appeal to many, be worthy of the cats that are featured  and will sell for a long time to come, we need a talented team of editors, designers and layout artists. This is the bulk of the costs.</p>
<p>2. Once the book is available for sale, we'll need to build and strengthen our outreach and distribution network. The more books we sell, the more markets we sell in, the more the cat charities will receive.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506785379/wmr9igvvwotgghqsoadd.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>As someone passionate about cats and the joy and love they bring to life, I want, as I am sure you do, to give back to the cat caretakers.

<p>Who are the direct beneficiaries of the net proceeds from book sales?</p>
<p><strong>Mohammed Alaa Aljaleel is Il Gattaro D'Aleppo</strong>. In a war zone, he has, over the past several years, taken his modest salary as an ambulance driver and selflessly used it to buy meat and other food for the cats orphaned or left behind as a result of the conflict in Syria. With more than 100 cats to care for, and more arriving every day, feeding these cats is an enormous and costly undertaking. Further, medication is unimaginably expensive. They need $3900 each month just to keep the cats alive.</p>
<p><strong>Abaykitties </strong>is a volunteer-run organisation that supports, cares for, spays and neuters an aging and robust feral populations on the Big Island of Hawaii and is funded only by donations. They go through 10 bags of food costing $180 a week . But some months, Abaykitties receives only $50.00 in total donations  and they are left wondering how to feed the cats. Neutering/spaying are on a donation basis, a vet visit costs $50 and euthanasia for the aging cats $30-$35 at a subsidised clinic.</p>
<p><strong>Whangamata CAT</strong> in New Zealand is a small group of volunteers providing safe refuge, food, and veterinary care for homeless, misplaced cats within the community. Currently self-funded by sales from their shop Kitschy Kat, they offer free neutering surgeries to eliminate unwanted litters and to control the cat population. They are seeking to funds build a  permanent cat shelter.</p>

<p><strong>Moving Ahead</strong> I am committed to publishing this book, whether or not I meet my fundraising goal of $7500. However, falling short of the target means that it will take a while before I can funnel net proceeds to the charities. I have to cover some of the start-up costs from future book sales till I reach break-even. Our author contributors, our team, and the two recipient shelters have all put their time, energy and money on the line to improve the lives of cats and kittens. I shall do the same and you'll definitely get a book if you choose that pledge!</p>
<p><strong>Budget</strong> We have carefully budgeted the campaign and production but there can always be unexpected or underestimated costs or hitches affecting timely delivery. Our team will work hard to overcome any problems and we will keep our supporters updated at every step!</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong> We hope to engage many, many cat lovers and animal supporters. We will do our best to answer your questions and welcome your comments and feedback.

</div></div>","I am a passionate cat-lover, channeling my grief over the loss of my long-time calico companion, Kealani, into a project designed to help elevate the quality of life of cats around the world. With the help of an amazing team of talent, we hope to do good in the world, starting with the cats.
Kitty Karma: Big Stories of Small Cats Who Change Our Lives is an anthology of unique cat stories. Some are hilarious, others heartbreaking.  Kitty Karma was born of a creative vision to honour all cats, and hopefully to elevate the welfare and life of cats in need.

We are contributing all net proceeds from the sales of this book to three needy cat charities. We see the book as an effective and novel means of generating sustainable donations to these:
1. Il Gattaro d’Aleppo (Cat Man of Aleppo) of Syria  
US$130 = food and medical supplies for a day for the cats OR US$3900 a month
2. ABayKitties, Big Island, Hawaii
US$20 = a bag of cat food that lasts 2 days. US$50 = a vet visit
Abaykitties looks after around 125+ ferals on the island.
3. Whangamata CAT in New Zealand 
Self-funding, but seeking US$360,000 = a permanent cat shelter to help/rehab abandoned & unwanted cats. The cat population multiplies during the summer tourist season.
Our writers are cat rescue volunteers, cat refuge and feral colony caretakers, cat bloggers, animal communicators, cat daddies, cat café owners and amazing parents, award-winning writers and journalists, all of whom have deep and special insights into the world of cats.
They have donated their stories for free because they care deeply about the cause.
My vision is to publish many more Kitty Karma books, selecting new recipient cat shelter organizations to support each time.

Kitty Karma Goes Global!
We know there are cat lovers (and cat slaves) everywhere around the world who want to do good – not just for the cats they love, but for all cats. Especially for the ones in need. Crowdfunding gives all you cat-loving supporters a chance to get behind a cause we can all be proud of.
I have launched this campaign as I need some help covering the costs of design, production and distribution to get the book out to the public. The sooner the book is in the hands of readers around the world, the faster we can generate net proceeds from book sales to help our three cat shelters.

A life graced by a cat is changed forever. All the stories in this book explore their inexplicable bond with us and besides, cats are endlessly amusing and entertaining. But cats need our help. There is over-crowding in shelters, ferals are multiplying,  there is cat abuse and cruel practices in kill shelters. This book seeks to entertain as well as raise awareness so we can do better by the cats who love us unconditionally.
Book Details:
6"" X 9""
28 stories, 25 chapters
300+ pages with original photographs in black and white.
Perfect binding
Color cover

 


Firstly, why a book as a way to raise donations to these cat charities? I view that a book has a longer shelf-life and a wider demand base than a T-shirt. It has the potential for a long-running inflow of revenues, and from those revenues, a sustainable stream of donations to the cat charities. 
We have stories that will appeal to cat-lovers and animal lovers that we can distribute around the world. As long as there is demand for the book, there will be net proceeds to donate to these charities. Plus, we are also seeking to raise awareness to the shadow aspects of the cat world - cat abuse, thoughtless cat surrenders and cruel practices at kill shelters - which are ordinarily overlooked or ignored.
We need funding to:
1.Get the book into the hands of the public. We need the start-up costs for production, design, printing, fulfillment and distribution.  To get a book that will appeal to many, be worthy of the cats that are featured  and will sell for a long time to come, we need a talented team of editors, designers and layout artists. This is the bulk of the costs.
2. Once the book is available for sale, we'll need to build and strengthen our outreach and distribution network. The more books we sell, the more markets we sell in, the more the cat charities will receive.

To honour your pledge, we've assembled a furr-tastic array of perks. Get free early-bird stories, electronic copies of the book, signed limited edition hard covers, an opportunity to get your own beloved cat’s picture featured in our M-M-Meow Gallery or, better yet, on the cover of the book.
To make sure you get the perk of your choice, please run your cursor over the delivery date related to the perk. A box with Pick This Perk will appear. Click on it and the rest is easy-peasy.
As someone passionate about cats and the joy and love they bring to life, I want, as I am sure you do, to give back to the cat caretakers. They are the ones who help rescue and care for the kitties, the mature, the abandoned and the disabled cats… those not yet fortunate enough to have found their forever homes. I hope you'll want to support this exciting project to help the cats and together, in our own small way, spread good around the world.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hopeful Despair is about how to unearth one’s purpose through social impact work. Throughout the book, finding the hope in situations of despair is delved into through the retelling of stories of social impact workers coupled with the author’s own perspective and experiences. Hopeful Despair will be published in February, 2020 by New Degree Press.</p><h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3><p>My name is Alyssa Skites and I am the author of Hopeful Despair. I wrote this book to discover what keeps various social impact workers motivated to continue their work despite the emotional drainage that often accompanies it.<br/><br/>The words of motivation by people fighting for all different types of causes are truly what makes this book worth reading. My goal was to transmit the humanistic side of the facts and figures displayed on the internet of the amount of people helped by specific nonprofit organizations or voluntary groups.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will become inspired by people who are doing great work, not necessarily because you have something meaningful to contribute to their cause, but because it does something to help you understand yours. I full-heartedly believe that the process of understanding the seriousness of the world can, in fact, transform your outlook to a more optimistic one. This book explores how acting upon your human agency will improve your own mental health, relationships, and overall happiness as you grow and find the warmth within yourself to make the world a little bit brighter.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the intersections of passion, commitment, advocacy, and creativity from individuals such as:</p><ul>
<li>Chris Temple from Optimist <a href=""https://optimist.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://optimist.co/</a>
</li>
<li>George Reginald Freeman from Pride Equality International <a href=""http://prideequality.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://prideequality.org/</a>
</li>
<li>Colin McElwee from Worldreader <a href=""https://www.worldreader.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.worldreader.org/</a>
</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are someone who has an extreme desire to improve the lives of others around you, no matter the capacity or reach.<br/> </p><h3><strong>The Book - Hopeful Despair</strong></h3><p>The book is broken into 22 chapters, touching upon some very heavy topics such as but not limited to:</p><ul>
<li>Domestic violence: trauma it provokes and some resources for dealing with its repercussions</li>
<li>The severe lack of medical assistance for undocumented immigrants</li>
<li>Human trafficking events occurring all over the world</li>
<li>The lack of sanitary care for shelterless people: specific case of San Francisco</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Besides paying for the production and shipping costs of the books themselves, the money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in February, 2020</span></li>
<li>The Cover Design of my book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for my book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book</li>
</ul><p>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.</p><p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now (specific tiers have different perks) including:</p><ul>
<li>Free shipping costs</li>
<li>A personally signed copy of my book when published</li>
<li>A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering</li>
<li>Your name will appear in a special, acknowledgements section in the book (“with special thanks to”)</li>
<li>Early access to the Introduction of Hopeful Despair with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</li>
<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</li>
<li>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experiences of writing my book and how you can do the same</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, by pre-ordering Hopeful Despair, you are not simply buying the book, you are contributing to my journey in a very intimate and transformative way.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3><p>Alyssa Skites is an adventurer and knowledge-seeker by heart who was blessed to have already, in 21 short years, experienced a plethora of opportunities that have shown her the beauty of existing with an open heart and an open mind. Alyssa has lived, befriended and worked with people from the various places she has, at one point, called home including Washington, Wisconsin, Hong Kong, Sitges, Barcelona, and San Diego. Through these experiences, she now believes in not just the importance but the cruciality of intercultural relationships to expand one’s view and appreciation of the world.<br/><br/>Alyssa is admittedly passionate about more things than she can handle, leading her to sometimes be overwhelmed when trying to compartmentalize her priorities. When she does manage to find the time to relax, she loves going out with her friends, engaging in deep, philosophical or vulnerable conversations (this is relaxing to her, she promises!), as well as a nice morning soaking up the sun while reading anything written by her idol, Elizabeth Gilbert. In more recent years, Alyssa has begun to actively work on calming her racing thoughts by practicing mindfulness specifically through meditation and yoga.<br/><br/>Alyssa’s desire to help others was instilled in her from a young age through her parent’s belief in the importance of community service. However, it wasn’t until she moved to Barcelona, Spain that she gained a much more intimate knowledge of various social issues. From this, her desire morphed into something much more; it developed into an undeniable assurance that beneficiary work was what she was meant to do for the rest of her life. Through writing Hopeful Despair, this assurance has been nothing but strengthened.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Alyssa at alyssaskites@gmail.com and on Instagram (@alyssa_skites) and on Facebook (Alyssa Skites).</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>Typically, the largest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to those who order it online.

Throughout the book, finding the hope in situations of despair is delved into through the retelling of stories of social impact workers coupled with the author’s own perspective and experiences. Hopeful Despair will be published in February, 2020 by New Degree Press.Story of My BookMy name is Alyssa Skites and I am the author of Hopeful Despair. I wrote this book to discover what keeps various social impact workers motivated to continue their work despite the emotional drainage that often accompanies it.The words of motivation by people fighting for all different types of causes are truly what makes this book worth reading. My goal was to transmit the humanistic side of the facts and figures displayed on the internet of the amount of people helped by specific nonprofit organizations or voluntary groups.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will become inspired by people who are doing great work, not necessarily because you have something meaningful to contribute to their cause, but because it does something to help you understand yours. I full-heartedly believe that the process of understanding the seriousness of the world can, in fact, transform your outlook to a more optimistic one. This book explores how acting upon your human agency will improve your own mental health, relationships, and overall happiness as you grow and find the warmth within yourself to make the world a little bit brighter.In this book, you'll learn about the intersections of passion, commitment, advocacy, and creativity from individuals such as:
Chris Temple from Optimist https://optimist.co/

George Reginald Freeman from Pride Equality International http://prideequality.org/

Colin McElwee from Worldreader https://www.worldreader.org/

You will love this book if you are someone who has an extreme desire to improve the lives of others around you, no matter the capacity or reach. The Book - Hopeful DespairThe book is broken into 22 chapters, touching upon some very heavy topics such as but not limited to:
Domestic violence: trauma it provokes and some resources for dealing with its repercussions
The severe lack of medical assistance for undocumented immigrants
Human trafficking events occurring all over the world
The lack of sanitary care for shelterless people: specific case of San Francisco
 What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Besides paying for the production and shipping costs of the books themselves, the money raised will go towards the following:
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in February, 2020
The Cover Design of my book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for my book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book
When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now (specific tiers have different perks) including:
Free shipping costs
A personally signed copy of my book when published
A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering
Your name will appear in a special, acknowledgements section in the book (“with special thanks to”)
Early access to the Introduction of Hopeful Despair with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback
The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover
I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experiences of writing my book and how you can do the same
And more...
As you can see, by pre-ordering Hopeful Despair, you are not simply buying the book, you are contributing to my journey in a very intimate and transformative way. About the AuthorAlyssa Skites is an adventurer and knowledge-seeker by heart who was blessed to have already, in 21 short years, experienced a plethora of opportunities that have shown her the beauty of existing with an open heart and an open mind. Alyssa has lived, befriended and worked with people from the various places she has, at one point, called home including Washington, Wisconsin, Hong Kong, Sitges, Barcelona, and San Diego. Through these experiences, she now believes in not just the importance but the cruciality of intercultural relationships to expand one’s view and appreciation of the world.Alyssa is admittedly passionate about more things than she can handle, leading her to sometimes be overwhelmed when trying to compartmentalize her priorities. When she does manage to find the time to relax, she loves going out with her friends, engaging in deep, philosophical or vulnerable conversations (this is relaxing to her, she promises!), as well as a nice morning soaking up the sun while reading anything written by her idol, Elizabeth Gilbert. In more recent years, Alyssa has begun to actively work on calming her racing thoughts by practicing mindfulness specifically through meditation and yoga.Alyssa’s desire to help others was instilled in her from a young age through her parent’s belief in the importance of community service. However, it wasn’t until she moved to Barcelona, Spain that she gained a much more intimate knowledge of various social issues. From this, her desire morphed into something much more; it developed into an undeniable assurance that beneficiary work was what she was meant to do for the rest of her life. Through writing Hopeful Despair, this assurance has been nothing but strengthened.For more information you can connect with Alyssa at alyssaskites@gmail.com and on Instagram (@alyssa_skites) and on Facebook (Alyssa Skites). Risks & ChallengesTypically, the largest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to those who order it online. I have eliminated this risk by building both the mailing and the shipping costs of your signed copies within each of the pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone, including the final one of publication. You will be promptly notified when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you choose not to contribute in the ways outlined above, any of the following acts of support would be appreciated more than you know:
