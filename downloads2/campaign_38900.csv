<h3>How it all began...</h3>
<p>The Flipflopi Project was started by Ben, Dipesh and Ali Skanda. </p>
<p>Ben and Dipesh are based in Kenya and the UK and their daytime jobs are in travel businesses that organize vacations to Africa for people from the US, UK and rest of the world. It was on a visit to Zanzibar that Ben saw the alarming amount of plastic - flipflops in particular - lining the beach, and as a direct response to that experience Ben, Dipesh and Ali started <a href=""http://www.theflipflopi.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Flipflopi project. </a></p>
<p>There is clearly a huge lag between the scale of the ocean plastic problem and the level of awareness about it among everyday consumers in Africa and the developing world countries that surround the Indian Ocean. The FlipFlopi Project is committed to changing that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524147777/ppjq7hayxsm33kwr9yzd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>An international problem</strong></h3>
<p>The 33 tonnes of plastic we found on our beach clean up in Lamu came from Thailand, Malaysia, India, China, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Indonesia – and of course Kenya and its neighbors.  Similarly much of the plastic in the oceans around the United States and European countries will also have originated elsewhere.  So addressing the ocean plastic through campaigning and education locally and regionally where the impacts are greatest, will not create lasting change.  To do that requires a global story… a global <a href=""http://www.theflipflopi.com/plastic-revolution/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PlasticRevolution</a>.  </p>
<p>Sir David Attenborough, Sylvia Earle, Markus Eriksen and others have done so much to highlight the solutions to plastic pollution.  You’ve probably heard of these giants of marine conservation – we want to take their messages to audiences who haven’t.  People that don’t speak or read English, that don’t own a television, who may never have seen the sea. </p>
<p>And with its simple messaging built around recycling the universally recognizable flipflop – an item of footwear worn by 3 billion people – <a href=""http://www.theflipflopi.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Flipflopi</a> has the potential to do this.</p>

<h3><strong>It’s surprising this hasn’t been done before... </strong></h3>
<p>Given how inexpensive, durable and widely abundant plastic waste is, it's surprising that it hasn't been done before.  Plastic comes in seven commonly found types which are rarely sorted in the waste streams - the expense in 'sorting' it has probably put people off...until now that is.</p>

<h3><strong>Here is what we will achieve...</strong></h3>
<p>Waste plastics will be used to construct the entire boat: the keel, ribs and structural elements from 60 tonnes of recycled plastic products including bottles and (approximately 5 million) bags, and the hull and decking will be covered completely by 200,000 washed up flip-flops. Despite the unusual materials, the vessel is being constructed by local craftsmen using traditional methods. This means no power tools and no computers… just centuries old knowledge. </p>

<p><b>The Sharing Economy </b>that we hear about in the media is almost always focused on Uber, Airbnb or some other company that connects people to stuff through an app. While the Internet and apps are an indispensable part of the present and future of sharing, <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3050775/the-sharing-economy-is-dead-and-we-killed-it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">time and again P2P (peer-to-peer) apps have struggled to connect people to stuff with a value under $500</a>. Furthermore, physical spaces offer a chance for people to connect with like-minded members of their community. That’s why we think the future of sharing will be a mix of physical spaces and online P2P connections.</p>
<p><b>Toronto Tool Library: </b>Since opening in 2013, the Toronto Tool Library has opened 4 locations and loaned over 25,000 tools to our members. The Tool Library works like a regular library and loans a wide range of hand, power and gardening tools so members don't have to own and store these items themselves. In 2015, <a href=""http://www.citynews.ca/2015/04/30/power-tools-and-paperbacks-now-under-one-roof-in-toronto-as-libraries-unite/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">we opened the first Tool Library housed within a public library in Canada so books and tools could be borrowed under the same roof.</a> </p>

<p><b>Inventory: </b>Our inventory consists of over 5,000 hand, power and gardening tools,
 99% of which were donated by Torontonians who no longer needed them. 
These tools have been used for building projects, renovations and 
gardening, improving people’s homes and lives in Toronto. By sharing 
instead of buying, we have saved our members over $1 million and reduced
 our collective environmental impact as fewer tools were needed to be 
manufactured, shipped, packaged and landfilled.</p>

<b>The Sharing Depot is the next stage in the evolution of 21st century sharing.</b><p><span></span><span>A membership will not only give access to these items, but will allow your home to be free of clutter, a <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/how-clutter-affects-your-brain-and-what-you-can-do-abo-662647035"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">leading cause of stress</a>.</span><br/></p>
<p>While this first project will largely be a real-life experiment, if our memberships meet our targets we anticipate opening more locations across the city and helping others start their own projects abroad. Ultimately we envision Sharing Depots will fill large warehouses (picture Costco) with thousands of items from musical instruments to audio/video equipment for short-term loans at a price that is accessible to all. These larger stores would have their own repair teams that will focus on extending the life of all of our items. Eventually we hope to make partnerships with quality manufacturers who design products specifically for sharing with durability and repair features designed into their products.

<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455718666/akec1rex0toofatm3czg.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>The Sharing Depot is a vision for how the future of city living can be. That being said, sharing items is a challenge to both the way our culture has manufactured items and consumed them for the past century. With respect to consumption, the 20th century was largely about mining, manufacturing and waste with almost no thought given to the finite nature of our planet’s resources or where products ended up after their useful life ended.</p>
<p>In the 21st century we must change that. Rather than mining virgin raw materials, we must mine the enormous assets that we have lying around our own homes and cities. Rather than manufacturing, we must focus on re-manufacturing, taking the best of these resources and repurposing them into durable and more efficient products that are built to last. In the 21st century, we want waste to no longer be something that we have to deal with - it should be designed out of the system altogether.</p>
<p>This transition can’t happen without you and that’s why we need your support. Big problems don’t just require big players like governments and multi-national corporations. They also require grassroots organizations and community groups that are on the ground, changing the culture of consumption and access and providing alternatives. These grassroots projects are only as successful as the communities that support them and that’s why crowdfunding campaigns like this one are a necessary part of this transition.</p>

<br/><p><b>This project sounds amazing, where will you be located?</b></p>
<p>We will have our first Sharing Depot near one of our current locations in Toronto. Depending on how much money we raise, we will open the Sharing Depot either near our East York location or our Parkdale location.</p>
<br/><p><b>What happens if you don’t raise the $30,000? </b></p>
<p>This campaign is an all-or-nothing campaign so if we don’t raise at least $30,000, we won’t open the Sharing Depot. The reason we chose to have this kind of campaign is because as a non-profit organization, we can’t afford to launch this new venture without this minimum amount of money. Rent, inventory and managing this kind of operation simply isn’t possible for our team without at least this minimal fundraising goal. </p>
<br/><p>The second reason is we don’t even want to open the Sharing Depot without the support of people who will actually use the service. We have learned that good ideas are one thing, but good ideas that people actually choose to invest in are often something different. With this campaign, we hope you will choose to purchase a membership, use the service and spread the word so the Sharing Depot can help shift our culture of consumerism away from ownership and waste.</p>
<br/><p><b>What happens if you raise more than $30,000?</b></p>
<p>Every dollar over $30,000 can make a huge difference in terms of the quality and location of the Sharing Depot. The more we raise, the bigger and better our space can be as a significant portion of these funds will go towards paying rent in Toronto. With your support, we will rent the best place we can possibly afford that allows for accessibility and population density to ensure we have the largest impact we can. </p>
<br/><p><b>Is the Sharing Depot and the Tool Library the same thing?</b></p>
<p>No. The Toronto Tool Library has four locations and has a separate membership model than the Sharing Depot will have. To start, we will have both enterprises in the same new location however memberships will be sold separately or a discount of 10% will apply to a combined membership.</p>
<br/><p><b>I have lots of items to donate - how can I do this?</b></p>
<p>Amazing! We rely on donations to help us make more items available to our members. To donate lightly used or new items that you think will fit with our Sharing Depot please email us at <a href=""mailto:contact@irbe.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact@irbe.org</a> or simply stop by one of our <a href=""http://torontotoollibrary.com/about-2/ourlocationandhour/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tool Library locations during our opening hours</a> to drop them off.</p>
<br/><p><b>I want to volunteer with this project, what opportunities are available?</b></p>
<p>Currently we are looking for librarians who will help with checkins/checkouts, inventorying items  and enjoy interacting with our members. We are also looking for help with website development, marketing and outreach, app development and sponsorships. If you would like to help out with these or any other areas you think would benefit our projects please email Ryan at ryan@irbe.org.</p>

</div></div>","Located in Toronto, The Sharing Depot will be a community hub where members have access to a wide range of things without owning or storing them. The Sharing Depot will be the first of its kind in Canada and the largest of its kind in the world. To start, The Sharing Depot will loan camping equipment, board games and sports equipment, house party supplies and even kids toys so that you can experience life without the price tag or the clutter. Rather than dropping hundreds of dollars at the shopping mall, you can now save your wallets and closets from buying and storing the things you use just a few times a year.           The Sharing Depot is our most ambitious project yet  and we need your help to make it a reality. BACKGROUND: At the Institute for a Resource-Based Economy (IRBE), the non-profit organization behind the Toronto Tool Library,
 we know what it takes to have a successful sharing project. In just 3 
years we have opened 4 Tool Library locations in Toronto, we have 
thousands of members and we've loaned over 25,000 tools. We’ve been 
recognized at the Greenest Group in Toronto and our programs and events have received extensive media coverage.THE SHARING DEPOT - INVENTORY: We’ve surveyed our members and done lots of research about what works in communities in Toronto and abroad to come up with a list of items we think will work best for a sharing project of this scale. With the success of this campaign, we'll be ready to share the following items: Camping Equipment: Includes tents, sleeping bags, dry bags, tarps, backpacks, coolers, flashlights/headlamps, camping stoves, cookware and more!Sports Equipment:  Includes footballs, soccer balls, baseball equipment, frisbees, racquets, snowshoes, sleds and more!House Party Supplies: Includes Karaoke machines, portable 
record players and speakers, fondue kits, bartending kits, lighting, 
punch bowls, a community music and DVD collection and more!Gaming:
 Includes a wide range of board games, poker chips, video games & 
outdoor games. Think of your favorite games and their expansion packs in
 one spot! Children’s Library: Includes toys, children’s games and portable equipment for 0-12 year olds. As they grow up, so can their toys with out clutter or waste! The Sharing Depot will also be a hub for swapping events in the community. In December 2015 we held Toronto’s largest Gift Swap Event where over 3,000 gifts were exchanged in just 3 days. 



The
 Sharing Depot will build on this success and offer a monthly swapping 
event for those wanting an alternative to consuming new products. The 
Depot will be your destination for discovering hidden gems without 
leaving your community. Swapping events will be themed each month and 
cover subjects like seasonal clothes, books and music, art, jewellery, 
games and more. 

MORE TO COME...With
 your support, we can not only start sharing on a large scale, but also 
generate the kind of data needed to help others launch similar projects 
everywhere. Since opening the Tool Library in 2013, we have helped dozens of Tool Libraries get started in cities across Canada, U.S. and Europe.
 With the Sharing Depot we also hope to 
spread this knowledge far and wide.

(thought it's always appreciated)! We need volunteers to help our team fundraise
 and reach the campaign goal of $30,000 in the next 30 days. By reaching out to
 your personal networks and contacts, helping us flyer at locations and 
talking to members at the Tool Library during your volunteer hours - you
 can help us expand the Tool Library into a new era of Sharing.  We'll 
supply you with the resources and tools to fundraise and as a 
special thanks, we've got rewards to give you for your time helping us. Interested? Email Contact@IRBE.org with subject line ""Sharing Ambassador"" 

              
The Sharing Economy that we hear about in the media is almost always focused on Uber, Airbnb or some other company that connects people to stuff through an app. While the Internet and apps are an indispensable part of the present and future of sharing, time and again P2P (peer-to-peer) apps have struggled to connect people to stuff with a value under $500. Furthermore, physical spaces offer a chance for people to connect with like-minded members of their community. That’s why we think the future of sharing will be a mix of physical spaces and online P2P connections.
Toronto Tool Library: Since opening in 2013, the Toronto Tool Library has opened 4 locations and loaned over 25,000 tools to our members. The Tool Library works like a regular library and loans a wide range of hand, power and gardening tools so members don't have to own and store these items themselves. In 2015, we opened the first Tool Library housed within a public library in Canada so books and tools could be borrowed under the same roof. 

To learn more, watch our videos: 



Community Nights: Beyond sharing tools, we also share a community workshop with 
woodworking tools, laser-cutting and 3D printing all available on site. 
Members pay a monthly fee to access the space 24/7 and we offer free 
weekly community nights for the public to take on projects and repairs 
with our experienced supervisors available to help out.


Inventory: Our inventory consists of over 5,000 hand, power and gardening tools,
 99% of which were donated by Torontonians who no longer needed them. 
These tools have been used for building projects, renovations and 
gardening, improving people’s homes and lives in Toronto. By sharing 
instead of buying, we have saved our members over $1 million and reduced
 our collective environmental impact as fewer tools were needed to be 
manufactured, shipped, packaged and landfilled.


The Sharing Depot is the next stage in the evolution of 21st century sharing.A membership will not only give access to these items, but will allow your home to be free of clutter, a leading cause of stress.
While this first project will largely be a real-life experiment, if our memberships meet our targets we anticipate opening more locations across the city and helping others start their own projects abroad. Ultimately we envision Sharing Depots will fill large warehouses (picture Costco) with thousands of items from musical instruments to audio/video equipment for short-term loans at a price that is accessible to all. These larger stores would have their own repair teams that will focus on extending the life of all of our items. Eventually we hope to make partnerships with quality manufacturers who design products specifically for sharing with durability and repair features designed into their products. 


   
The Sharing Depot is a vision for how the future of city living can be. That being said, sharing items is a challenge to both the way our culture has manufactured items and consumed them for the past century. With respect to consumption, the 20th century was largely about mining, manufacturing and waste with almost no thought given to the finite nature of our planet’s resources or where products ended up after their useful life ended.
In the 21st century we must change that. Rather than mining virgin raw materials, we must mine the enormous assets that we have lying around our own homes and cities. Rather than manufacturing, we must focus on re-manufacturing, taking the best of these resources and repurposing them into durable and more efficient products that are built to last. In the 21st century, we want waste to no longer be something that we have to deal with - it should be designed out of the system altogether.
This transition can’t happen without you and that’s why we need your support. Big problems don’t just require big players like governments and multi-national corporations. They also require grassroots organizations and community groups that are on the ground, changing the culture of consumption and access and providing alternatives. These grassroots projects are only as successful as the communities that support them and that’s why crowdfunding campaigns like this one are a necessary part of this transition.





    
This project sounds amazing, where will you be located?
We will have our first Sharing Depot near one of our current locations in Toronto. Depending on how much money we raise, we will open the Sharing Depot either near our East York location or our Parkdale location.
What happens if you don’t raise the $30,000? 
This campaign is an all-or-nothing campaign so if we don’t raise at least $30,000, we won’t open the Sharing Depot. The reason we chose to have this kind of campaign is because as a non-profit organization, we can’t afford to launch this new venture without this minimum amount of money. Rent, inventory and managing this kind of operation simply isn’t possible for our team without at least this minimal fundraising goal. 
The second reason is we don’t even want to open the Sharing Depot without the support of people who will actually use the service. We have learned that good ideas are one thing, but good ideas that people actually choose to invest in are often something different. With this campaign, we hope you will choose to purchase a membership, use the service and spread the word so the Sharing Depot can help shift our culture of consumerism away from ownership and waste.
What happens if you raise more than $30,000?
Every dollar over $30,000 can make a huge difference in terms of the quality and location of the Sharing Depot. The more we raise, the bigger and better our space can be as a significant portion of these funds will go towards paying rent in Toronto. With your support, we will rent the best place we can possibly afford that allows for accessibility and population density to ensure we have the largest impact we can. 
Is the Sharing Depot and the Tool Library the same thing?
No. The Toronto Tool Library has four locations and has a separate membership model than the Sharing Depot will have. To start, we will have both enterprises in the same new location however memberships will be sold separately or a discount of 10% will apply to a combined membership.
I have lots of items to donate - how can I do this?
Amazing! We rely on donations to help us make more items available to our members. To donate lightly used or new items that you think will fit with our Sharing Depot please email us at contact@irbe.org or simply stop by one of our Tool Library locations during our opening hours to drop them off.
I want to volunteer with this project, what opportunities are available?
Currently we are looking for librarians who will help with checkins/checkouts, inventorying items  and enjoy interacting with our members. We are also looking for help with website development, marketing and outreach, app development and sponsorships. If you would like to help out with these or any other areas you think would benefit our projects please email Ryan at ryan@irbe.org.",25.0,5,"2 Campaigns

protecting their habitats. We are working hard to understand the role 
smaller habitats play in the recovery of humpback whales 
through research. <br/></p>
<p>Humpback whales wintering off Puerto Rico are part of the much larger North Atlantic population. They travel from summer feeding grounds near Canada, the USA, Greenland, and Iceland down to the warmer waters in the Caribbean to give birth and mate. Puerto Rico is one of the small habitats used by humpback whales during winter but we need to understand why this area is important by studying individuals in their natural environment. Only then can we protect their resources and help the population of whales as they continue to recover from centuries of whaling.<br/></p>
<p>We reach out to the public through presentations and education programs with an aim at creating ambassadors for healthy oceans that support whales and other marine life. Our education efforts (including students, interns, and research assistants) are aimed at creating ambassadors and advancing fledgling marine scientists to the benefit of healthy oceans and humans.<br/></p>
<p>Our research team is comprised of the principal investigator (Mithriel MacKay), support staff, research assistants and interns participating in the Humpback Whale Field Intensive program at the Marine and Coastal Ecology Research Center (MCERC). To date, everybody working on this project volunteers!<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>We need your support to continue research and education programs. Our 
goal includes purchasing a small boat for conducting research on the water which will stretch our budget much further than having to charter a boat and captain. We need a
 theodolite for tracking whales and human activity from land allowing us to collect data without 
interrupting whales' behaviors. We want to put our programs in the reach of many people by subsidizing internships placing valuable experience in reach of fledgling marine biologists in need of skills helping them compete for jobs aimed at conservation. <p></p>
<p>Your generosity will go a long way in assuring research and education continue!  You will have the satisfaction of knowing that all donations are applied to efforts that help support the recovery of humpback whales as well as other marine life. <br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will have a local, regional, and global impact!  Whales in the Caribbean are the same whales throughout the North Atlantic therefore, supporting research on the winter habitats supports humpback whales throughout the entire ocean!</p>
<p>People who study with us come from all over the United States and the rest of the world!

<h3>Family Owned and Sustainably Operated</h3>
<p>Hello, we are Dayna and David Beddick.  Together with our family and friends, we have been working towards the goal of opening a sustainable brewery.  Environmental stewardship has been a core value throughout our lives and we continue to incorporate personal changes to improve the environment.</p>
<p>Our intention in opening a brewery is to deliver a high quality, hand crafted product utilizing numerous technologies to do so an environmentally responsible way.  We have actively designed our building to take advantage of solar positioning and will minimize energy usage by including LED lighting, energy efficient appliances, and bio-based insulation made of soybeans and recycled plastic bottles.</p>
<p>Reducing our energy usage is only a part of the equation.  We hope to generate our own renewable energy by incorporating two solar technologies.  First, we will use a series of flat plate collectors to pre-heat the strike and sparge water during the brewing process.  The collectors will utilize the power of the Florida sun to heat the water to over 165 F.  Second, we will start with a small photovoltaic (PV) array to generate electricity to supplement the energy consumed in our all electric, 3-phase electric brewhouse.</p>
<p>Our cost for the PV array is just over $3,000 per kW.  <u>Here is where we would like for you to help us.</u>  We are requesting donations to increase our solar capacity during the build process so that we can take the greatest advantage of the technologies and production of energy.  In exchange for your donations to this worthy environmental cause, we will reward you with various gifts to help you show your support for Increased Solar at A Little Madness Brewing Company.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We are offering a number of different donation levels to reward you.  From glassware and coasters to shirts and growlers, there is a little something for everyone.  Also, <strong>ALL </strong>donations will receive a <strong>FREE</strong> die cut sticker of the A Little Madness Brewing Company logo <strong>AND</strong> donations greater than $20 will receive a <strong>FREE</strong> specialty Madness Pint Glass.  </p>
<p><strong>We will also be hosting a donors' party at the Brewery as we get closer to opening.  As a donor you will be invited to attend this private party as part of our soft opening process.  We look forward to rewarding our founding sponsors at this event.</strong></p>

All naming donations will receive a full swag pack for FREE as a thank you.  This will include membership into the mug club, a pair of T-shirts, four specialty pint glasses, a stainless steel growler, the yoga mat, the disc golf plastic, and whatever else we have on hand to give you.

 
All proceeds raised will go to support sustainable causes at the brewery.  While our goal is set at $3,333, no matter what amount we raise it will be used to add to our solar collection capabilities.
 

The Impact
We have utilized solar technologies at home and are very excited to increase the production of renewable energy as we build the brewery.  We will continue to be responsible advocates for the environment as we continue to grow in the future.  Your donations at this point will have the greatest impact by allowing us to increase generation as soon as possible.
 

Risks & Challenges
For those who have been following us for awhile, you know that we have continually overcome a number of challenges to bring our brewery to life.  We had to change land use codes through lengthy process that involved numerous boards and votes.  The battle continued as we moved forward through the conditional usage process and ultimately to the obtaining of our development order.
While we still have to move through the federal TTB process as well as additional state regulations, we are certainly not slowing down.  We have been preparing for this development for several years now and are committed to seeing our dream come to fruition.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone is in a position to donate their money to our campaign.  We do ask everyone to spend a minute to share our campaign with as many others as possible so that we can spread the word about the great things we are doing at A Little Madness Brewing Company.

<p>For a farmer in Senegal, participation in the organic industry
is practically inaccessible. In order to earn a premium for his/her crops,
organic farmers seeking certification must rely solely on European agencies who
rack up unfathomable bills. Facilitate financial freedom  is possible for
farmers in Senegal and in turn create incentive for sustainable food production
and environmental stewardship through participation in a more accessible and incentive Organic
Movement.</p>
<p>Our plan is to set up a
branch of an already accredited USDA certified agency which is much more
promising than if we attempted to accredit an African grass roots organization
into the EU organic program at this point.  </p>
<p>Traveling is the number one expense to and while in Senegal.
I am requesting funding to help cover my traveling costs while in Senegal as
well as other associated travel expenses and fees. I
will use these funds to live modestly while I research the potential of this
region and develop grant funding information. Any amount of money left over
will serve as the initial certification fees for the organization which will be
safeguarded until the first audit by the USDA National Organic Program costing
upwards of $12,000 or more.  Once I
gather enough information on-site, I will be better equipped to write grants to
major organizations, requesting the necessary funding in order to see it
through. The more support I receive through this platform, the less grant
funding will be needed and the more efficient we can be in moving forward!</p>
<p>Why become accredited or affiliated with a certification agency?
In brief, this recognition will boost the confidence consumers have in organic
produce in Senegal on a local scale. On a larger scale, it will give farmers
the option to export their products abroad as buyers will recognize their third-party
verification. Without access to an organically certified agency, organic
farmers are currently feeling the pressure to conform to conventional
agricultural practices, in turn destructing the soil further, and not to
mention increasing community health risks due to harmful toxin exposure from
pesticides which we all hopefully know by now lead to cancer and birth defects.</p>
<p>Since 2008 I have been working with the founder of SAPOA
(Senegalese Association for the Promotion of Organic Agriculture, formed in
1989) to develop a plan to become accredited with the EU and/or USDA.
Currently, this independent NGO works with grower associations to promote
organic agriculture and agro-forestry practices in the environmentally decimated region
of the Sahel desert. SAPOA inspects and certifies organic farms under his
label which does not hold international recognition. The founder is on the board
of the Senegalese Organic Standards and SAPOA is accredited with
IFOAM (International Foundation for Organic Agriculture Movement). </p>
<p>Financial support is our only identified obstacle at
present.  We appreciate and rely on your contributions!</p><p></p></div>","Hello! Thank you for your interest!

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">There’s a difference between what we ingest versus what we put on our skin.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When we eat food, the enzymes in our saliva and stomach help break down</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">chemicals and flush them out.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When we put something on our skin, it goes straight to</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">our organs through our bloodstream and doesn’t filter out the toxins at all.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THIS CAN PROVOKE CANCER, INFERTILITY AND AFFECT HORMONES</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our skin is the largest organ in our body,</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">so why do we slather it with artificial and dangerous chemicals?</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">NOMADE brings you</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PROTECTION WITHOUT POLLUTION</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Most people know that sunscreen is full of chemicals</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">that affect our health and the marine life, right?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Yet still, we take this for granted, applying synthetic beauty products with little consideration for the impact on our bodies and the environment. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At Wisdom Cares, we have designed sunscreen that combines skin and environmental care.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our objective is to offer sun care that has minimal impact on our shared environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Products that we are free to enjoy and move us all closer towards a plastic and chemical free life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Developed with leading experts in natural skincare and tested to European standards</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">- the highest in global sunscreen regulation - </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our new sunscreen NOMADE combines mineral and organic-based filters to provide </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">100% natural sun protection against both UVA and UVB rays.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">However, we go one step further.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">NOMADE provides sun protection and also nourishment and rejuvenation</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">through a combination of ingredients that harness the power of nature. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Add UV protection to your daily skincare routine, whatever the weather.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We need sunscreen to prevent sun damage and ageing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We think it's safe to assume we all want the same from sunscreen.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We want natural protection that works, feels nice on our skin,</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">and at the same time cares for the world we live in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Enriched with algae extract, and tamanu oil, Nomade sunscreen provides protection and hydration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In addition, antioxidant and antibacterial properties from carrot oil nourish the skin, preventing irritation and breakouts. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581870414/dars6mfge29u0fzydq9u.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">designed for surfers and ocean lovers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Water and sweat-resistance comes from natural and vegan candelilla wax and tinted from cacao. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Candelilla wax is a plant based wax and a vegan alternative to beeswax. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Like beeswax, it is skin conditioning, easily absorbed, odourless, and rich in nutrients.</p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So what's the problem with normal sunscreen?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Traces of these chemical filters absorb through the skin into the bloodstream and have been detected in urine and breast milk too. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">No to uncertain chemicals. Simply nature’s best.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">We want TO MAKE THE SWITCH TO SOLID SHAMPOO BARS for several reasons</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SHAMPOO BARS ARE PLASTIC-FREE PACKAGING</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This is by far the number one reason to make the switch to shampoo bars.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and the number is projected to jump another 20% by 2021. Just 7% of those collected were turned into new bottles. That means, approximately 93% of the 480 billion plastic water bottles sold in 2019 </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">ended up in landfill or in the ocean.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SHAMPOO BARS ARE GREAT FOR TRAVEL</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Shampoo bars are great to travel with as you don't have to worry about any potential for spillage or liquid restrictions. The bars are perfect for carry on as not only are they small and lightweight, they are TSA approved, which means you don’t have to plan your packing around your hair care products! And best of all, they help prevent using the individual-sized shampoos at your hotel, which goes back to point #1 about reducing packaging waste.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SHAMPOO BARS ARE MULTI-PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Shampoo bars can also be used for other purposes like washing your body, your pets in a pinch or your clothes while camping or travelling! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581614431/p5tynezhxxasy2x3qpyf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>After months of trial, we were still left wanting for something that would perform better for us. So we went down the path of formulating our own bars and PAPAYA was born.</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Zero-plastic packaging. Recycled, recyclable, and reusable.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We believe in products that are ocean and eco-friendly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Not just the product but the packaging too. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Yes, sadly a lot of natural brands are selling their products in plastic or unnecessary packaging.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">That's doesn't make sense at all! It's like going only half way of an environmental change.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So in Wisdom cares, we provide an alternative with glass bottles and aluminium containers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">First, it’s important to note that glass is endlessly recyclable, back to its original use. It never loses its quality and purity, no matter how many times it’s recycled. Plus, glass has an almost zero rate of chemical interactions, which ensures that the products inside a glass bottle keep all their qualities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Then we chose aluminium containers for our sunscreen face SPF 50 because they are made from recycled aluminium, plus they can be recycled again and reused.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581721871/dqowuub9rz9jrnnqdt0a.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>You're told that plant-based plastics are biodegradable, but they will only break down in an industrial composting facility, not your average garden compost bin. They won’t biodegrade at all buried in a landfill. There, they will sit for hundreds or thousands of years like any other piece of plastic waste.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">That's not all... The recycling infrastructure isn't yet in place which means that most bio-plastics can't even be recycled. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So out of the options currently available, we believe that the best way to go is :</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Recycled | Reusable | Recyclable</strong></p>

Just 100% natural, daily skin protection and safe shampoo.
 
    
 
HOW CHEMICALS AFFECT YOUR HEALTH 
 
There’s a difference between what we ingest versus what we put on our skin.
When we eat food, the enzymes in our saliva and stomach help break down
chemicals and flush them out.
When we put something on our skin, it goes straight to
our organs through our bloodstream and doesn’t filter out the toxins at all.
THIS CAN PROVOKE CANCER, INFERTILITY AND AFFECT HORMONES
Our skin is the largest organ in our body,
so why do we slather it with artificial and dangerous chemicals?
 
 
HOW CHEMICALS AFFECT THE OCEANS
 
When we shower, the toxic chemicals of our shampoo
- Fragrance - Sodium laureth sulfate - Parabens - DMDM hydantoin -
ENTER OUR WATERWAYS.
 When we swim, toxic chemicals of our sunscreen
- Oxybenzone - Octinoxate - Octocrylene - Benzophenone 1 & 8 - AND MUCH MORE
WASH OFF IN OUR OCEANS.
 
    
 
NOMADE brings you
PROTECTION WITHOUT POLLUTION
Most people know that sunscreen is full of chemicals
that affect our health and the marine life, right?
Yet still, we take this for granted, applying synthetic beauty products with little consideration for the impact on our bodies and the environment. 
At Wisdom Cares, we have designed sunscreen that combines skin and environmental care.
Our objective is to offer sun care that has minimal impact on our shared environment.
Products that we are free to enjoy and move us all closer towards a plastic and chemical free life.
Developed with leading experts in natural skincare and tested to European standards
- the highest in global sunscreen regulation - 
Our new sunscreen NOMADE combines mineral and organic-based filters to provide 
100% natural sun protection against both UVA and UVB rays.
 

 
However, we go one step further.
NOMADE provides sun protection and also nourishment and rejuvenation
through a combination of ingredients that harness the power of nature. 
Add UV protection to your daily skincare routine, whatever the weather.
We need sunscreen to prevent sun damage and ageing.
We think it's safe to assume we all want the same from sunscreen.
We want natural protection that works, feels nice on our skin,
and at the same time cares for the world we live in.
Enriched with algae extract, and tamanu oil, Nomade sunscreen provides protection and hydration.
In addition, antioxidant and antibacterial properties from carrot oil nourish the skin, preventing irritation and breakouts. 
 

 
We've also created a sport version, with a tinted face sun protection SPF 50,
designed for surfers and ocean lovers.
Water and sweat-resistance comes from natural and vegan candelilla wax and tinted from cacao. 
Candelilla wax is a plant based wax and a vegan alternative to beeswax. 
Like beeswax, it is skin conditioning, easily absorbed, odourless, and rich in nutrients.
 
    
 
So what's the problem with normal sunscreen?
Traces of these chemical filters absorb through the skin into the bloodstream and have been detected in urine and breast milk too. 
No to uncertain chemicals. Simply nature’s best.
 

 
We want TO MAKE THE SWITCH TO SOLID SHAMPOO BARS for several reasons
SHAMPOO BARS ARE PLASTIC-FREE PACKAGING
This is by far the number one reason to make the switch to shampoo bars.  
A million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and the number is projected to jump another 20% by 2021. Just 7% of those collected were turned into new bottles. That means, approximately 93% of the 480 billion plastic water bottles sold in 2019 
ended up in landfill or in the ocean.
 

 
SHAMPOO BARS ARE GREAT FOR TRAVEL
Shampoo bars are great to travel with as you don't have to worry about any potential for spillage or liquid restrictions. The bars are perfect for carry on as not only are they small and lightweight, they are TSA approved, which means you don’t have to plan your packing around your hair care products! And best of all, they help prevent using the individual-sized shampoos at your hotel, which goes back to point #1 about reducing packaging waste.
 
SHAMPOO BARS ARE MULTI-PURPOSE
Shampoo bars can also be used for other purposes like washing your body, your pets in a pinch or your clothes while camping or travelling! 
 

 
After months of trial, we were still left wanting for something that would perform better for us. So we went down the path of formulating our own bars and PAPAYA was born.
 
 

 
Zero-plastic packaging. Recycled, recyclable, and reusable.
We believe in products that are ocean and eco-friendly.
Not just the product but the packaging too. 
Yes, sadly a lot of natural brands are selling their products in plastic or unnecessary packaging.
That's doesn't make sense at all! It's like going only half way of an environmental change.
So in Wisdom cares, we provide an alternative with glass bottles and aluminium containers.
First, it’s important to note that glass is endlessly recyclable, back to its original use. It never loses its quality and purity, no matter how many times it’s recycled. Plus, glass has an almost zero rate of chemical interactions, which ensures that the products inside a glass bottle keep all their qualities.
Then we chose aluminium containers for our sunscreen face SPF 50 because they are made from recycled aluminium, plus they can be recycled again and reused.
 

 
You're told that plant-based plastics are biodegradable, but they will only break down in an industrial composting facility, not your average garden compost bin. They won’t biodegrade at all buried in a landfill. There, they will sit for hundreds or thousands of years like any other piece of plastic waste.
That's not all... The recycling infrastructure isn't yet in place which means that most bio-plastics can't even be recycled. 
So out of the options currently available, we believe that the best way to go is :
Recycled | Reusable | Recyclable
 
     Wisdom Cares is an indie skincare brand that was bootstrapped from the ground up.We would like to continue working this way as it gives us the freedom to experiment and grow organically without pressure to compromise who we are. We're asking for 25,000 EUR  so we can continue to spread our Wisdom for a sustainable living.  Where will the money go?The funds raised on Indiegogo will be used to :
Purchase packaging
Pay for laboratory production
Get the Vegan and Organic certifications
Cover trademarking fees
Attend industry-leading trade shows
With the expansion of our line, we are hoping to have our new products in the hands of retail buyers across Europe. To do this, we need to stay top of mind at industry leading events. Costs to attend these events can be quite high. We’ve already formulated our recipes and sourced the ingredients for our new products.That means we’re ready to start producing once the Indiegogo funds are received.Manufacturing takes about 6-8 weeks, so you can expect to receive all your products in time for the Summer season.      Wisdom Cares is a young startup founded three years ago by Herbalist and Creative director, Chloé Millet. Already in a vegan lifestyle and avoiding any chemicals, she was shocked about all the lies the beauty industry can make you believe, knowing the tonnes of toxic chemicals they use, the animal testing and the abusive amount of plastic contaminating the environment.Slowly we are growing, and now, Melissa Mostowys joined the adventure as Digital Marketing Strategist Director and she is deeply involved in creating a better world.Ali Al-Ebrahim joins the adventure as Visual Director and also brings a lot of support in our vision.As consumers look for natural skincare products and plastic-reduction, we are effectively working to provide a high-quality, ecological solution currently lacking in the European market.  Thank you for taking the time to look at our campaign.If you have any questions, please reach out. We’re here to help.       We have already completed our formulations with our laboratory, sourced packaging, and designed labels, so we are confident we will be able to deliver all products on time. However, if we are delayed in our production schedule, you'll be the first to know. We acknowledge the inevitable risks in our first production run, which could potentially lead to delayed production and consequently, delivery.Our customers are always our number 1 priority, and we truly believe that transparent communication is key.We are 100% committed to providing timely and detailed communication!Please note that we ship out of Barcelona to all Europe.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In most developing countries recycling rates are a dismal 2-8%.

<p>The fall of oil prices has made it cheaper for companies to use virgin
plastic (new plastic from oil) rather than recycled plastic. The decreased demand
for recycled plastic has caused a massive drop in the value of plastic which waste pickers collect.
The millions of waste picker recyclers who rely on collecting discarded
plastics have been affected the most. In some regions their income has
decreased 40% since oil prices fell in 2013.  <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439595047/t6jyn5cqqd6nshh0caxp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>2) Fighting climate change through recycling.</b></span></p>

<h3>What are we fundraising for?</h3>
<p>Through a few years of working with farmers and community stakeholders in the food system, we learned that in Squamish, like many areas in Southwest BC, farmers experience barriers to producing food. Some of these barriers include: access to land, land affordability, knowledge gaps, etc. Food policy council staff and volunteers spent some time visiting and learning how community organizations are creatively addressing these complex barriers in the lower mainland. Community Farms are a great way to affect systemic change in the food system. </p>
<p>We’ve learned first hand the positive impacts that gardening can have people through our Mamquam Edible Schoolyard and community gardens. Through the community farm, we plan to involve youth aged 13-18 in Squamish. The community farm will offer no-cost activity options, employment, and create opportunities for different generations to spend time together.</p>
<p><br/>The community farm will have two main components. The CAN Farm aspect will be a market garden, where we will involve youth in the learning, growing, and selling produce to the community. In addition to the CAN Farm that we operate, we will lease several “incubator plots” that new farmers can lease for 1-4 years. This will help new farmers access land, without the significant financial investment and risk of buying their own property. There will be opportunities for these new farmers to share resources with the CAN Farm for tools, processing, storage, and sales. We will also facilitate a mentorship program to connect the new farmers to older farmers to address the gap in farming knowledge many new farmers have. The community farm will be open to the public to learn about sustainable agriculture practices, food preservation, celebrations, etc. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 Everyone needs a calendar, so why not also support the farmers who grow our food?? Proceeds will go towards establishing a community farm to engage youth in growing food, and support new farmers. 
What We Need & What You Get
Here's what's going on:

Your donation covers printing, design, and photography costs for a 2019 On the Farm calendar. 
The calendar features Squamish farmers and food producers. Photos were taken by our amazing friend and photographer Nina LaFlamme. 

Proceeds from calendar sales will fund the creation of a community farm in Squamish, BC. 
If you want this calendar for cheaper, this is the time to get it as a perk. Once our Indiegogo campaign is over, calendar prices will go up!


The Impact
The community farm will: 

Engage Squamish youth in growing and selling local food
Provide youth with no-cost activities, employment, and employable skills
Provide nutritious, sustainable food for the community
Protect farmland from development
Provide low-barrier access to new farmers wishing to start a business
Educate the community about climate-friendly agriculture
Provide a space for the community to learn about and eat food, and connect with each other


What are we fundraising for?
Through a few years of working with farmers and community stakeholders in the food system, we learned that in Squamish, like many areas in Southwest BC, farmers experience barriers to producing food. Some of these barriers include: access to land, land affordability, knowledge gaps, etc. Food policy council staff and volunteers spent some time visiting and learning how community organizations are creatively addressing these complex barriers in the lower mainland.

<p>Hello! I am Valerie.</p>
<p>August 14th is my birthday, and I'm going
to become twenty this year. Twenty years old is a milestone for me, and it
means I am no longer a teenager. I've always been passionate about social good,
and I've decided that it's time I start to do good for the
world.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p>This year, for my 20th birthday, I want to raise funds for four non-profit
organizations which I really care about and believe in: Crossroads Foundation, Compassion in World Farming, Kiva and WaterisLife. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So let me explain the four organizations I want to donate to.</p>
<p>The first is <b>Crossroads Foundation</b>, which does a lot of great work such as distributing donations of goods to people in need, and offering simulation experiences where participants can step briefly into the shoes of people facing global challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second is <b>Compassion in World Farming</b>, which works on farm animal welfare and campaigns peacefully on a global level to end all cruel factory farming practices of animals.</p>
<p>The third is <b>Kiva</b>, which <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">connects people through lending to alleviate poverty, and uses the the internet and a worldwide network of microfinance institutions to allow people to lend as little as $25 to help create opportunity for others around the world. </span></p>
<p>The fourth is <b>WaterisLife</b>, which provides clean drinking water, sanitation and hygiene education programs to those in desperate need. I really support two of their projects, which is the WaterisLife straw, and the Drinkable manual.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Below you can read the detailed description of what these organizations do and why I decided to raise funds for these four organizations. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Greatest Birthday Gift</h3>
<p>This is the very first time I am using my birthday to do good and further causes that I am really passionate about.  I am excited, and nervous!</p>
<p>I really hope that as a birthday gift, you will help to donate to my campaign. I will be donating as well! Of all the donations I receive, I will personally donate 10% extra from my own pocket. My goal is to raise $1000 USD of donations, and I will donate $100 USD as well. All these will go towards helping the four non-profit organizations that I have mentioned above. </p>

</div><p><b>Why I want to donate to this organization </b></p>
<p>When I was in Hong Kong, I first met the head of Crossroads Foundation, David Begbie, at a conference where he gave a very inspiring speech. Subsequently, I went to visit his organization and participate in their Global X-periences, namely the HIV/AIDS experience, the Blind Experience and Struggle for Survival. These were very impactful and I gained much more empathy for people who had HIV/AIDS, who suffered from river blindness, and who were in poverty. It motivated me to want to do more for these groups of people. I really feel that more people should go for these simulations that Crossroads conducts so that they will be able to increase in awareness and empathy for people in need. </p>
<p>I also talked to David Begbie personally where he was very sincere and generous in giving advice. He is really great and so is his team at Crossroads Foundation who are all full-time volunteers. As such, I really want to support their efforts and enable them to do more.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Compassion in World Farming (CIWF)</h3><div>

I feel it's so horrible that they have to live a life full of so much misery and suffering, probably worse than anything humans have to face. I've done my best not to eat meat since I was five years old, but I really want to do much more about animal cruelty. I know it is hard for most people to give up meat, so I support what CIWF is doing by getting business to adopt ethical farming methods, and educating consumers about buying free-range meat. </p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Kiva </h3><p><a href=""http://www.kiva.org/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.kiva.org/home</a><br/></p><p>""We are a non-profit organization with a mission to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty.

</div><p><b>Why I want to donate to this organization </b></p>
<p>It is really a tragedy to me that clean water, which is so available and accessible for me, is something that close to a billion people do not have access to. The drinking of dirty or polluted water causes so many water-borne diseases such as river blindness, and diarrhea, which results in many deaths as well. All these illnesses could have been prevented if people had access to clean water or filtration devices. I really want to help WaterisLife to be able to provide clean water, sanitation and hygiene programs to those who lack them. WaterisLife provides a special Straw to people, which is<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> a small, portable filtration device that filters out waterborne diseases and provides pure, clean drinking water whenever it is immersed into a water source. I think this is really great and innovative! I also think it's really cool that they are working on another product, the Drinkable Book, which is a life saving tool that filters water and teaches proper sanitation and hygiene to those in the developing world.

<h3></h3><h3>Why so many NGOs? Why not just choose one? </h3><div>That's because I am passionate about doing different kinds of good! There's not just one cause that I'm super passionate about, it's quite a few. I did do research and shortlisted from quite a number of NGOs to just these four which I feel promote values I think are important, are innovative, and represent causes which are most important to me. </div><div>While I know it's much more effective for marketing and everything to just support one NGO, I feel like having these four NGOs to support is more reflective of who I am and what I am passionate about, which consists of more than one thing! <br/>To not support one of these NGOs would feel like I'm leaving out a part of who I am and what I believe in, for the sake of simplicity and a more unified story.<br/>

All these illnesses could have been prevented if people had access to clean water or filtration devices. I really want to help WaterisLife to be able to provide clean water, sanitation and hygiene programs to those who lack them. WaterisLife provides a special Straw to people, which is a small, portable filtration device that filters out waterborne diseases and provides pure, clean drinking water whenever it is immersed into a water source. I think this is really great and innovative! I also think it's really cool that they are working on another product, the Drinkable Book, which is a life saving tool that filters water and teaches proper sanitation and hygiene to those in the developing world.

Why so many NGOs? Why not just choose one? That's because I am passionate about doing different kinds of good! There's not just one cause that I'm super passionate about, it's quite a few. I did do research and shortlisted from quite a number of NGOs to just these four which I feel promote values I think are important, are innovative, and represent causes which are most important to me. While I know it's much more effective for marketing and everything to just support one NGO, I feel like having these four NGOs to support is more reflective of who I am and what I am passionate about, which consists of more than one thing! To not support one of these NGOs would feel like I'm leaving out a part of who I am and what I believe in, for the sake of simplicity and a more unified story.

As you read more about these NGOs and why I chose to support them, I hope you will understand the value of these organisations and support them as well. (:",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, we’re the Mono Lake Committee. You probably know us—we’re the group that saved the big salty lake with the strange rock towers in the Eastern Sierra from excessive water diversions to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>We’re at it again—this time the problem is that five years of drought have lowered Mono Lake seven feet, shrinking a protective moat of water around the lake’s islands, and putting one of the world’s largest nesting colonies of California Gulls in danger.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487207317/evscwg7kpbs2fl7ggib5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After all of the shoveling we've done this winter, we <i>know</i> it's hard to believe that we still need a fence. But we've run the numbers. Even if storms continue to cross the Sierra Nevada and drop much-needed snow in the Mono Basin watershed, the major lake rise from that meltwater will arrive in summer, long after the gulls need protection for the nesting season. </p>

<p>Last summer biologists found signs that coyotes crossed the remaining 500 or so feet of shallow water to prey on eggs and chicks. Now that the coyotes know how to get out there, we have to do something to protect the gulls when they arrive to lay their eggs this year—in April.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487012727/zfc6finqbrjeggbceb6u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Even with this winter turning unexpectedly wet, Mono Lake's wintertime rise will put the lake back around the same elevation as last year when coyotes crossed the moat. The problem is that now they<i> know</i> that there's easily-accessible food out there, and that it's worth crossing the moat.</p>

<p>To keep the gulls safe we’re putting up a temporary solar electric mesh-netting fence across the landbridge. We’ve consulted with coyote behavior experts and ranchers in the Mono Basin who agree that a fence is the best way to deter clever coyotes.</p>

<h3>Epic winter lifts spirits but won’t raise Mono Lake in time for nesting season</h3>
<p>by Geoffrey McQuilkin, Mono Lake Committee Executive Director</p>
</div><div>
<p>Five years of drought lowered Mono Lake seven feet, shrinking the protective moat of water between the lake’s north shore and Negit Island and adjacent islets that are home to one of the world’s largest nesting colonies of California Gulls. Last summer signs were found on several of these islets of coyotes crossing the remaining 500 or so feet of shallow water to prey on eggs and chicks.</p>
<p>Ultimately Mono Lake will rise, covering the landbridge and restoring the natural watery protection that the gulls have relied on for safety for centuries. But in the meantime, the Mono Lake Committee has been working with California State Parks, in consultation with the Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife and US Forest Service, on a plan for a solar-powered electric mesh netting fence, similar to those used with livestock on ranches. The fence will be temporary and fully removable when the lake rises above the threshold of concern, and it will be removed for the fall and winter to avoid obstructing wildlife outside the nesting season.</p>
<p><strong>Not enough water in the moat</strong></p>
<p>Currently there is not enough water in the moat separating the gull colony from the landbridge to provide safety. When researchers found clear signs that coyotes had crossed to some of the islets last summer, Mono Lake stood at 6378.3 feet above sea level—only a few inches higher than the current lake level. Although the impact of the breach was limited, the concern is that knowledgeable coyotes are likely to return and use their experience to explore deeper into the colony.</p>
<p>Analysis to determine when a fence is needed requires a lot of careful examination of lake levels. As the lake has fallen during the drought, 6378 feet has been the “trigger” level for starting the project, representing a level at which island access is clearly possible and the cost and effort of mounting a fence project in response is worthwhile. The lake fell below 6378 feet in September 2016 and plans for fence construction moved to implementation as a result.</p>
<p>The construction trigger, however, is not the same as determining when the gull colony is naturally protected by the lake. With the winter turning unexpectedly wet, the Committee has begun to focus less on “when a fence is needed” and more on “when it is not needed.” At 6380 feet the moat grows wide enough and deep enough to serve as a natural deterrent to coyote access.</p>
<p>Thus the question we’ve been spending a lot of time analyzing (while the office has been buried under snow): How high will Mono Lake rise—and how fast?</p>
<p><strong>Timing is everything</strong></p>
<p>California Gulls arrive at Mono Lake during the waning days of winter and start building their nests and laying eggs in April. Gulls are consistent about this schedule pretty much regardless of weather conditions because they have an important deadline to beat: chicks need to hatch, grow, learn to fly, and be strong enough to head to the coast before the subsequent winter arrives.</p>
<p>In contrast, winter snows don’t usually melt enough to significantly raise Mono Lake’s level until around June. So even if storms continue to cross the Sierra Nevada and drop much-needed snow in the Mono Basin watershed, the major lake rise from that meltwater will arrive in summer, long after the gulls need protection for the nesting season.</p>
<p>Committee staff and experts have been forecasting lake level rise using four different scenarios that are updated monthly as winter precipitation stacks up. At press time the takeaway is this: Mono Lake is likely to rise to 6380 feet, but not until the first half of July. This matches the regular pattern and confirms that the fence is still needed this year.</p>
<p><strong>Variations on the theme</strong></p>
<p>Depending on how wet the remainder of the winter is, some variations on the main fence plan may be in order. For example, the planned route is designed to accommodate the lake level falling across the four months of the nesting season. Now that the reverse situation has arrived, with the lake expected to rise monthly through the spring and summer, the fence route could be adapted and possibly shortened.</p>
<p><strong>Could upcoming storms make a difference?</strong></p>
<p>Even with the above points in mind, it is reasonable to ask whether it is possible that the winter will end up so wet that a fence will not be necessary. After all, the snowpack was 200% of average on February 1 .</p>
<p>The answer is: it is highly unlikely. The drought has impacted Mono Lake and all of California heavily, and recovering from those impacts, particularly lake level decline, will take more than a single wet year. In the Committee’s lake level projections, the chance of an extraordinary end to the winter causing the lake to rise fast and high enough to eliminate the need for the fence is essentially zero.</p>
<p>We will continue to watch closely to see how the lake level forecast develops. Should an unprecedented rise become a reality we will gladly cheer the snow gods, celebrate Mono Lake’s rise, and put the fence plans on the shelf in case of a future drought. But analysis tells us the lake won’t rise in time to protect the gulls, and so the fence is needed. As a result the Committee and partners continue to advance the fence effort with implementation expected in March.</p>

<h3>Why are gulls so important?</h3>
<p>Since 1983 scientists have monitored Mono Lake’s California Gull (Larus californicus) breeding colony annually in order to measure the year-to-year variation in population size and reproductive success. The objectives of the study are to measure these parameters as they relate to changing lake and other environmental conditions. Three standardized procedures are conducted each year: in late May every nest is counted within the breeding colony to ascertain the population size; in early July all chicks within 10 study plots are banded, and in fall a mortality assessment of banded chicks is made. The California Gull population is an effective measurement of Mono Lake’s health. It has been found to be very strongly tied to certain lake conditions, and monitoring the gulls each year is an effective way to keep a vigilant eye on the lake environment. After 34 years of study, the information gained is not only valuable for the gulls and Mono Lake, but also because 34 years of data makes for uniquely long data set for any avian population.</p>

Epic winter lifts spirits but won’t raise Mono Lake in time for nesting season
by Geoffrey McQuilkin, Mono Lake Committee Executive Director

Five years of drought lowered Mono Lake seven feet, shrinking the protective moat of water between the lake’s north shore and Negit Island and adjacent islets that are home to one of the world’s largest nesting colonies of California Gulls. Last summer signs were found on several of these islets of coyotes crossing the remaining 500 or so feet of shallow water to prey on eggs and chicks.
Ultimately Mono Lake will rise, covering the landbridge and restoring the natural watery protection that the gulls have relied on for safety for centuries. But in the meantime, the Mono Lake Committee has been working with California State Parks, in consultation with the Department of Fish & Wildlife and US Forest Service, on a plan for a solar-powered electric mesh netting fence, similar to those used with livestock on ranches. The fence will be temporary and fully removable when the lake rises above the threshold of concern, and it will be removed for the fall and winter to avoid obstructing wildlife outside the nesting season.
Not enough water in the moat
Currently there is not enough water in the moat separating the gull colony from the landbridge to provide safety. When researchers found clear signs that coyotes had crossed to some of the islets last summer, Mono Lake stood at 6378.3 feet above sea level—only a few inches higher than the current lake level. Although the impact of the breach was limited, the concern is that knowledgeable coyotes are likely to return and use their experience to explore deeper into the colony.
Analysis to determine when a fence is needed requires a lot of careful examination of lake levels. As the lake has fallen during the drought, 6378 feet has been the “trigger” level for starting the project, representing a level at which island access is clearly possible and the cost and effort of mounting a fence project in response is worthwhile. The lake fell below 6378 feet in September 2016 and plans for fence construction moved to implementation as a result.
The construction trigger, however, is not the same as determining when the gull colony is naturally protected by the lake. With the winter turning unexpectedly wet, the Committee has begun to focus less on “when a fence is needed” and more on “when it is not needed.” At 6380 feet the moat grows wide enough and deep enough to serve as a natural deterrent to coyote access.
Thus the question we’ve been spending a lot of time analyzing (while the office has been buried under snow): How high will Mono Lake rise—and how fast?

At press time the takeaway is this: Mono Lake is likely to rise to 6380 feet, but not until the first half of July. This matches the regular pattern and confirms that the fence is still needed this year.
Variations on the theme
Depending on how wet the remainder of the winter is, some variations on the main fence plan may be in order. For example, the planned route is designed to accommodate the lake level falling across the four months of the nesting season. Now that the reverse situation has arrived, with the lake expected to rise monthly through the spring and summer, the fence route could be adapted and possibly shortened.
Could upcoming storms make a difference?
Even with the above points in mind, it is reasonable to ask whether it is possible that the winter will end up so wet that a fence will not be necessary. After all, the snowpack was 200% of average on February 1 .
The answer is: it is highly unlikely. The drought has impacted Mono Lake and all of California heavily, and recovering from those impacts, particularly lake level decline, will take more than a single wet year. In the Committee’s lake level projections, the chance of an extraordinary end to the winter causing the lake to rise fast and high enough to eliminate the need for the fence is essentially zero.
We will continue to watch closely to see how the lake level forecast develops. Should an unprecedented rise become a reality we will gladly cheer the snow gods, celebrate Mono Lake’s rise, and put the fence plans on the shelf in case of a future drought. But analysis tells us the lake won’t rise in time to protect the gulls, and so the fence is needed. As a result the Committee and partners continue to advance the fence effort with implementation expected in March.

Why are gulls so important?
Since 1983 scientists have monitored Mono Lake’s California Gull (Larus californicus) breeding colony annually in order to measure the year-to-year variation in population size and reproductive success. The objectives of the study are to measure these parameters as they relate to changing lake and other environmental conditions. Three standardized procedures are conducted each year: in late May every nest is counted within the breeding colony to ascertain the population size; in early July all chicks within 10 study plots are banded, and in fall a mortality assessment of banded chicks is made. The California Gull population is an effective measurement of Mono Lake’s health. It has been found to be very strongly tied to certain lake conditions, and monitoring the gulls each year is an effective way to keep a vigilant eye on the lake environment. After 34 years of study, the information gained is not only valuable for the gulls and Mono Lake, but also because 34 years of data makes for uniquely long data set for any avian population.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Campaign Update: The Gorda Draw!</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/></strong>While strolling through the town of San Juan de Limay, we came across some women baking pastries in their outdoor wood oven. We asked if we could film them working and they graciously invited us into their home. Inside, we discovered an incredible collection of stone carvings that they sell as another form of income.</p>
<p>One such carving is the ‘Gorda’. She’s a cultural icon here in Limay, where the voluptuous is admired and celebrated. There are many of these ladies overlooking the road from Esteli to Limay as well as throughout the town here. Each statue represents and promotes an activity or cultural aspect of Limay. Some are holding a child, or flowers, and there’s even one making some tortillas. The statues around town are quite large whereas the one we bought is only about 5 inches tall.</p>

<p>For our campaign we would like to do a draw for this little statuette that we purchased from the ladies. For every $25 donated, you’ll be entered to win this little beauty.

<h2>What's this campaign about?</h2>
<p>Hi there! We're a Montreal-based non-profit called <a href=""http://www.takingroot.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taking Root</a> that develops social reforestation projects in Nicaragua. This means we collaborate with small-scale farmers to help them reforest unused parts of their land. Our aim is to use reforestation as a tool to restore ecosystems, improve livelihoods, and tackle climate change. Pretty great stuff, right?<br/><br/><img alt=""Taking Root team"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://takingroot.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/team.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> In the last five years, our project has worked with hundreds of subsistence farmers to plant over 500,000 trees. This coming summer, we'll be working with these farmers to plant yet another 400,000 trees! But in order for this project to succeed and keep growing, we need to show the world the value of what we do through images.<br/><br/>That's why, for this campaign, <strong>we're raising funds to create a series of educational videos about our project.</strong> We'd like to capture footage during our upcoming planting season to bring awareness to the benefits of social reforestation and generate support for the project in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>What do we need your support for?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This summer will be the project's biggest planting season ever, so we need to document this incredible milestone and demonstrate the passion that the entire community puts into the reforestation efforts.<br/><br/>However, creating a successful, comprehensive and informative video is no easy feat.  Your contributions will help cover the cost of a trip (flight, lodging, transportation) to Nicaragua for our very talented photographer and documentarian. They will also cover the editing and production costs of putting together high-quality videos with all of this great footage after the trip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With this, we'll create a series of great, educational videos to capture the essence of this beautiful project, and promote the equitable approach that our organization has to reforestation. We'll also highlight some of the new innovative aspects of the project that are going on right now, like building fuel-efficient cookstoves and using biochar in agriculture, so that we can get much needed support for these initiatives in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img alt=""Planter"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://takingroot.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/planter.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<h2>What are we offering in return?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>In exchange for your invaluabe support, we're offering the great perks that you see to the right. These include sending you postcards and haikus from the trip, fantastic photos that were taken on the trip, and actually planting trees in your honour while we're there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're also offering producer and executive producer status, which will give you and/or your company visibility with every video we create and share. There's even an option to have personalized versions of the videos created for you that emphasize your valuable role in supporting these projects. Please <a href=""mailto:brooke@takingroot.rog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact us</a> for more details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We'll make this initiative work one way or another even if we don't reach our funding goal. However, the more funds we receive, the more energy we can invest in doing a really great job and producing an excellent series of videos.</p>
<h2>Why support this cause?</h2>
<h3>Poverty, deforestation and climat change</h3>
<p>Deforestation accounts for around 17% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which is more than the entire global transportation sector. CO2 is the primary gas leading to human-caused climate change, and we're already feeling the impacts of this global issue. Yet it is the world's poorest countries, lacking the resources to adapt and fight the impacts of climate change, which are feeling the impacts the worst. We have now reached a tipping point and we need, more than ever, to take action!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taking Root's community-based initiative provides a key solution to this global problem, while also addressing issues of local poverty in Nicaragua. We're asking for your support because together we have the power to create a better world that we are proud to hand down to the next generation. As ambassadors, we can spread the word!</p>
<h3>Why Nicaragua?</h3>
<p>Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Americas, and has a long history of political turmoil and poor environmental management. As a result, there is a great need for social reforestation – where community members are directly involved in the decision making process and are paid for the work that they do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, because of the year-round tropical climate, trees grow at least 10 times faster closer to the equator than they do in Canada. This means that they are ten times more effective at sequestering carbon, releasing oxygen, restoring nutrients to the soil, helping retain humidity and much more!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>
</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
We know that not everyone has the funds to contribute. So if you want to help out in other ways, please help us spread the word, using the Indiegogo share tools on this page. The more we raise, the more trees we plant, and the better equipped we'll be to tell the story of this great project.<p></p>

Why our project is valuable to the community.
Implementation of renewable and sustainable energy sources is important in ensuring a safe and healthy environment for generations to come. Pursuing these types of energy sources is not only beneficial to humans, but to the diverse population of flora and fauna as well. We are stewards of the natural world and are wholly dependent on it.

All our coffee is wet processed in an artisanal way to get a cleaner, brighter and fruitier taste. This also develops a nice degree of acidity without compromising the body and mouth feel of the coffee. The coffee is then gently sun dried so the heat won’t damage the delicate and complex flavors and aromas that the coffee plant has been storing in the developing coffee bean throughout the whole year. When the coffee is dry it is allowed to rest a little before being roasted to perfection.

All the coffee is freshly roasted just before shipping so you get

enjoy all the hard work and attention to detail that goes into this artisanal coffee.<br/>

an ideal climate for growing high quality coffee. <b>As farmers we are facing the

the temperatures more extreme</b>. We believe that if we want to keep growing the
best coffee possible we have to stop climate change. We are already helping to get
carbon out of the atmosphere by incorporating organic matter back in the soil
but we want to do even more. The biggest source of carbon dioxide on the farm
is the truck we use to haul things back and forth to the farm. <b>We would like to
replace the truck with an electric cargo bicycle that would be emissions free and
would drastically reduce the carbon emitted to the atmosphere during the
production of the coffee.</b></p>
<h2><b>What We Need</b></h2>
<p>We would like to start with a <a href=""http://surlybikes.com/bikes/big_dummy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Surly Big Dummy</a> cargo bicycle
that is able to carry up to 400 pounds. The bike is also nimble and fast and it
can be geared down low enough to tackle the steep grades that we encounter in
the mountains where coffee likes to grow. We would also like to add an electric
motor to help tackle the steeps hills when the bike is fully loaded especially
after a hard day’s work at the farm. The bike costs $2000 dollars and the electric
bike conversion kit is $1000. That is why our goal is to reach $3000 dollars.
We feel that it is not a lot of money for the big impact it will have on our
world.<br/></p>

</div>","We are a family of traditional coffee growers in the mountains
of Veracruz, Mexico. We have been growing some of the best coffees for
generations.

Enjoying lunch at the farm

We implement careful management of the land, including a wide
diversity of shade trees that create the perfect microclimate and provide
shelter to a wide variety of native animals. We ensure the selection of the
best seeds and plant these with organic compost for the best possible start. We
carefully handpick only perfectly ripe coffee cherries.




All our coffee is wet processed in an artisanal way to get a cleaner, brighter and fruitier taste. This also develops a nice degree of acidity without compromising the body and mouth feel of the coffee. The coffee is then gently sun dried so the heat won’t damage the delicate and complex flavors and aromas that the coffee plant has been storing in the developing coffee bean throughout the whole year. When the coffee is dry it is allowed to rest a little before being roasted to perfection.

Sun drying the coffee


All the coffee is freshly roasted just before shipping so you get
the best possible product, and you can enjoy it at its peak. We really hope you
enjoy all the hard work and attention to detail that goes into this artisanal coffee.

We wouldn’t be able to do all this without the blessing of
an ideal climate for growing high quality coffee. As farmers we are facing the
daunting challenge of climate change making the rains more unpredictable and
the temperatures more extreme. We believe that if we want to keep growing the
best coffee possible we have to stop climate change. We are already helping to get
carbon out of the atmosphere by incorporating organic matter back in the soil
but we want to do even more. The biggest source of carbon dioxide on the farm
is the truck we use to haul things back and forth to the farm. We would like to
replace the truck with an electric cargo bicycle that would be emissions free and
would drastically reduce the carbon emitted to the atmosphere during the
production of the coffee.

</h3><h2>Greening the Desert Sequel Site, Jordan, with Alex McCausland and Salah Hammad</h2><p><b>Starts Apr 19, 2014 and runs for 13 day(s).</b></p><p>Hello everyone, </p><p>I have the opportunity to participate in a greening the desert project from April 19th 2014. The thing is that I can not afford the airfare to travel and the cost to cover the design course prior to the voluntary work. I believe that this is a project with a lot of beautiful elements in its essence. We need to reconnect with the Earth and what better ways are there than to fight desertification and climate changes in order to help the people who really need this for the prospects of a better future.<br/><br/><i>NB!: If we do not reach the amount needed, the next course available will be six month after (but in a different location). </i></p><p><span>This PDC follows the standard accredited 72-hour design course syllabus with running translation into Arabic. All written materials will also be translated. The course covers in detail the ecological basis of Permaculture design, the ethics, the principles of design, strategies for restoring soils, managing water, partitioning land between intensity of uses for efficient management, cycling of energy and minerals within our system, enactment of site survey and assessment as well as design strategies for different climactic, ecological, technological and cultural settings. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/341396/files/20140131125822-_RA66Z8Q.JPG?1391201902"" src="""" style=""""/></p><em>The Jordan Valley Permaculture Project in November 2013</em><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Permaculture is a system that allows us to design sustainability into our own lives. Living sustainably literally means living in a way we can continue to live - a way of life which does not destroy the means of its own sustenance. If we consume food produced in a way that destroys soil, poisons the water and pollutes the air, as current systems of production do, we cannot be living sustainably and we will eventually no longer be able to produce food. The one sentence definition of Permaculture is: ""A design system for sustainable human settlements and productive landscapes."" It is a conceptual tool-kit for how we can establish productive systems to support our needs while re-generating the ecological processes that support the planet. And it can be done at the domestic, community or commercial scales, as we need.</span><br/></p><p><br/>This course will equip me with all the necessary tools to produce a Permaculture design for my own life situation. It is the necessary first step in becoming a Permaculture practitioner and will allow me to go on to register in internships, training of trainers (TOT) courses or for a Diploma in Permaculture Design (PDP) all offered by various Permaculture institutions around the world. The PDC is a formative stage in career development which may compliment my existing life vision or may allow me to radically re-evaluate where I want to go from here. Either way it's sure to be an eye-opener.<br/><br/>Topics covered on this PDC: <br/><br/>- Ethics and principles of Permaculture Design<br/>- Ecological basis of Earth-System Function<br/>- Soils - conservation and re-generation: composting and fertility building techniques<br/>- Water - management and treatment in domestic scale systems<br/>- Intensive Garden Design<br/>- Poultry and Small Animal Systems<br/>- Food Forests - planning, nursery establishment, propagation and planting out<br/>- Earthworks for water harvesting, storage, infiltration and distribution<br/>- Ecological Agriculture Systems<br/>- Ecological Pasture Systems<br/>- Ecological Forestry Systems<br/>- Design strategies for Temperate, Dry-Land and Wet-Tropical Climates.<br/>- Aquaculture<br/>- Site survey <br/>- Community needs assessment<br/>- Full Site Design Development and Evolution<br/><br/><strong>About the teachers</strong><br/><br/><strong>Abdurrahman (Alex) McCausland</strong> is an ecologist by background, developed as a Permaculture practitioner and trainer over the last seven years. He graduated in Biological Sciences in 2003 [MA 2.1 (Hons) Merton College, Oxford, United Kingdom]. Alex speaks English (mother tongue), fluent Amharic (Ethiopia's vernacular language) and has basic understanding of Arabic and French.<br/><br/>In 2004-5 Alex studied a post graduate diploma in Economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London. Following this he went travelling through the Middle East and Africa visiting Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. Astonished by Ethiopia, seeing a land of great ecological wealth and yet economic poverty and food insecurity, he resolved to set up a Permaculture project there. He took his first Permaculture Design Course later that year in Catalunya, Spain. In 2007 he returned to Ethiopia to establish the country's first PC training and demonstration site with a local school-gardens community outreach program. Alex developed the site with input from a number of volunteers, interns and Permaculture practitioners (Guy Rees, Dan Palmer, Rosemary Morrow &amp; Tichafa Makovere). Working alongside these people Alex developed his skills as a Permaculture designer and practitioner. Since 2008 the project has hosted a total of 31 PDCs: 2 led by Rosemary Morrow, 19 by Tichafa Makovere, 1 by Steve Cran, 1 by Rhamis Kent and 8 led by Alex himself since December 2010. Alex has delivered trainings and Permaculture design-consultancies to: the Ethiopian Red Cross Society, the Ethiopian NGO SMART (who administers the Hafto Solar Community WASH Project in Hadyia Zone, South Ethiopia), and the Daughters of Charity Food Security Project in Dembe Dollo, Western Ethiopia.<br/><br/>- <a href=""http://permacultureglobal.com/users/932-alex-mccausland"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alex McCausland's profile on the Worldwide Permaculture Network website</a><br/>- Sample consultancy and training delivered by Alex McCausland: <a href=""http://permaculturenews.org/2013/08/27/report-on-permaculture-training-in-dembe-dollo-western-ethiopia-part-3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dembe Dollo Training For Daughters of Charity Food Security Project</a> <br/>- Consultacy for SMART at the Hafto Solar Community WASH Project, Hadyia Zone<br/><a href=""http://permacultureglobal.com/pri_pdc_teacher_certificates/296/inline?1359564038"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sample course outline</a>.<br/>- <a href=""http://www.permaculturenews.org/files/Alex_McCausland_Student_References.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Previous student references</a><br/><br/><strong>Salah Hammad:</strong> Salah's passion for sustainable food production started while working with struggling small farmers in Jordan. The experience exposed him to the urgent need for an alternative approach. This is when he decided to make the transition into a career in Permaculture and agro-ecology following a 10 year long career in the food industry. During his career Salah has led and trained large teams in different food production related projects and setups, including manufacturing, service and sales. <br/><br/>Salah is now designing, teaching and practicing Permaculture at the Permaculture Research Institute Zaytuna Farm, Australia, under the direct management of Geoff and Nadia Lawton. He has direct experience in dry arid, temperate, and subtropical climates, covering urban, rural and broad acre setups. Salah endeavors to design and install systems that empower individuals and communities with Permaculture tools that will help them meet their needs and care for the earth. For the past few months Salah has worked on developing an Arabic language PDC syllabus and he is now due to teach courses together with Alex McCausland in Sudan, Ethiopia and Jordan in the first half of 2014. For Salah, this is an important formative stage: breaking out of the trainee pupa to become one of the world's first bi-lingual English-Arabic PDC teachers.<br/><br/>Articles by Salah Hammad:<br/><br/>- <a href=""http://permaculturenews.org/2013/01/15/greening-the-desert-internship-2012-greener-than-ever/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greening the Desert Internship 2012 - Greener than Ever</a><br/>- <a href=""http://permaculturenews.org/2013/01/09/wadi-hadhramaut-the-start-of-a-large-new-rehabilitation-project-in-yemen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wadi Hadhramaut - the Start of a Large New Rehabilitation Project in Yemen</a><br/>- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWX955AY7Y3NvfoCG-Hc6WA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Salah's Arabic YouTube channel</a><br/><br/><strong>Course Venue</strong><br/><br/>The Jordan Valley Permaculture Project (aka ""Greening the Desert - the Sequel"" site), PRI Jordan, Al-Jawfa, Jordan Valley.<br/><br/>The site is located in the Al-Jawfa area in western Jordan, Shouneh Janobieh (i.e., South Shouneh), in the Dead Sea Valley just 10km north of the Dead Sea and 6 km east of the Jordanian-Palestinian border, directly east of the West Bank. <br/><br/>The local population is made up of traditional Bedouin tribes and long-term refugees stemming from displacement of local populations from within Palestine. The project site is typical of the area - a marginal, arid land, low-income settlement. It is currently still under development and upon completion it will demonstrate energy-efficient appropriate housing with natural cooling systems and a plant nursery attachment, solar electricity, solar hot water, biological waste water treatment recycling, dry compost toilets, rainwater harvesting earthworks and diverse interactive plant, animal and tree systems for local food production and processing. The demonstration house will function as a classroom and administration office for the project and local Permaculture groups. Once established, the project will serve as a model that can be replicated within the village, throughout Jordan and other countries in the region. The project, started in 2008, has already seen significant progress. The first trees were planted and are growing well and the first garden is producing some vegetables. Now, the water tank needs to be expanded, the fence and gate improved and the rest of the project started.

Greening the Desert Sequel Site, Jordan, with Alex McCausland and Salah HammadStarts Apr 19, 2014 and runs for 13 day(s).Hello everyone, I have the opportunity to participate in a greening the desert project from April 19th 2014. The thing is that I can not afford the airfare to travel and the cost to cover the design course prior to the voluntary work. I believe that this is a project with a lot of beautiful elements in its essence. We need to reconnect with the Earth and what better ways are there than to fight desertification and climate changes in order to help the people who really need this for the prospects of a better future.NB!: If we do not reach the amount needed, the next course available will be six month after (but in a different location). This PDC follows the standard accredited 72-hour design course syllabus with running translation into Arabic. All written materials will also be translated. The course covers in detail the ecological basis of Permaculture design, the ethics, the principles of design, strategies for restoring soils, managing water, partitioning land between intensity of uses for efficient management, cycling of energy and minerals within our system, enactment of site survey and assessment as well as design strategies for different climactic, ecological, technological and cultural settings. The Jordan Valley Permaculture Project in November 2013Permaculture is a system that allows us to design sustainability into our own lives. Living sustainably literally means living in a way we can continue to live - a way of life which does not destroy the means of its own sustenance. If we consume food produced in a way that destroys soil, poisons the water and pollutes the air, as current systems of production do, we cannot be living sustainably and we will eventually no longer be able to produce food. The one sentence definition of Permaculture is: ""A design system for sustainable human settlements and productive landscapes."" It is a conceptual tool-kit for how we can establish productive systems to support our needs while re-generating the ecological processes that support the planet. And it can be done at the domestic, community or commercial scales, as we need.This course will equip me with all the necessary tools to produce a Permaculture design for my own life situation. It is the necessary first step in becoming a Permaculture practitioner and will allow me to go on to register in internships, training of trainers (TOT) courses or for a Diploma in Permaculture Design (PDP) all offered by various Permaculture institutions around the world. The PDC is a formative stage in career development which may compliment my existing life vision or may allow me to radically re-evaluate where I want to go from here. Either way it's sure to be an eye-opener.Topics covered on this PDC: - Ethics and principles of Permaculture Design- Ecological basis of Earth-System Function- Soils - conservation and re-generation: composting and fertility building techniques- Water - management and treatment in domestic scale systems- Intensive Garden Design- Poultry and Small Animal Systems- Food Forests - planning, nursery establishment, propagation and planting out- Earthworks for water harvesting, storage, infiltration and distribution- Ecological Agriculture Systems- Ecological Pasture Systems- Ecological Forestry Systems- Design strategies for Temperate, Dry-Land and Wet-Tropical Climates.- Aquaculture- Site survey - Community needs assessment- Full Site Design Development and EvolutionAbout the teachersAbdurrahman (Alex) McCausland is an ecologist by background, developed as a Permaculture practitioner and trainer over the last seven years. He graduated in Biological Sciences in 2003 [MA 2.1 (Hons) Merton College, Oxford, United Kingdom]. Alex speaks English (mother tongue), fluent Amharic (Ethiopia's vernacular language) and has basic understanding of Arabic and French.In 2004-5 Alex studied a post graduate diploma in Economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London. Following this he went travelling through the Middle East and Africa visiting Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. Astonished by Ethiopia, seeing a land of great ecological wealth and yet economic poverty and food insecurity, he resolved to set up a Permaculture project there. He took his first Permaculture Design Course later that year in Catalunya, Spain. In 2007 he returned to Ethiopia to establish the country's first PC training and demonstration site with a local school-gardens community outreach program. Alex developed the site with input from a number of volunteers, interns and Permaculture practitioners (Guy Rees, Dan Palmer, Rosemary Morrow & Tichafa Makovere). Working alongside these people Alex developed his skills as a Permaculture designer and practitioner. Since 2008 the project has hosted a total of 31 PDCs: 2 led by Rosemary Morrow, 19 by Tichafa Makovere, 1 by Steve Cran, 1 by Rhamis Kent and 8 led by Alex himself since December 2010. Alex has delivered trainings and Permaculture design-consultancies to: the Ethiopian Red Cross Society, the Ethiopian NGO SMART (who administers the Hafto Solar Community WASH Project in Hadyia Zone, South Ethiopia), and the Daughters of Charity Food Security Project in Dembe Dollo, Western Ethiopia.- Alex McCausland's profile on the Worldwide Permaculture Network website- Sample consultancy and training delivered by Alex McCausland: Dembe Dollo Training For Daughters of Charity Food Security Project - Consultacy for SMART at the Hafto Solar Community WASH Project, Hadyia ZoneSample course outline.- Previous student referencesSalah Hammad: Salah's passion for sustainable food production started while working with struggling small farmers in Jordan. The experience exposed him to the urgent need for an alternative approach. This is when he decided to make the transition into a career in Permaculture and agro-ecology following a 10 year long career in the food industry. During his career Salah has led and trained large teams in different food production related projects and setups, including manufacturing, service and sales. Salah is now designing, teaching and practicing Permaculture at the Permaculture Research Institute Zaytuna Farm, Australia, under the direct management of Geoff and Nadia Lawton. He has direct experience in dry arid, temperate, and subtropical climates, covering urban, rural and broad acre setups. Salah endeavors to design and install systems that empower individuals and communities with Permaculture tools that will help them meet their needs and care for the earth. For the past few months Salah has worked on developing an Arabic language PDC syllabus and he is now due to teach courses together with Alex McCausland in Sudan, Ethiopia and Jordan in the first half of 2014. For Salah, this is an important formative stage: breaking out of the trainee pupa to become one of the world's first bi-lingual English-Arabic PDC teachers.Articles by Salah Hammad:- Greening the Desert Internship 2012 - Greener than Ever- Wadi Hadhramaut - the Start of a Large New Rehabilitation Project in Yemen- Salah's Arabic YouTube channelCourse VenueThe Jordan Valley Permaculture Project (aka ""Greening the Desert - the Sequel"" site), PRI Jordan, Al-Jawfa, Jordan Valley.The site is located in the Al-Jawfa area in western Jordan, Shouneh Janobieh (i.e., South Shouneh), in the Dead Sea Valley just 10km north of the Dead Sea and 6 km east of the Jordanian-Palestinian border, directly east of the West Bank. The local population is made up of traditional Bedouin tribes and long-term refugees stemming from displacement of local populations from within Palestine. The project site is typical of the area - a marginal, arid land, low-income settlement. It is currently still under development and upon completion it will demonstrate energy-efficient appropriate housing with natural cooling systems and a plant nursery attachment, solar electricity, solar hot water, biological waste water treatment recycling, dry compost toilets, rainwater harvesting earthworks and diverse interactive plant, animal and tree systems for local food production and processing. The demonstration house will function as a classroom and administration office for the project and local Permaculture groups. Once established, the project will serve as a model that can be replicated within the village, throughout Jordan and other countries in the region. The project, started in 2008, has already seen significant progress. The first trees were planted and are growing well and the first garden is producing some vegetables. Now, the water tank needs to be expanded, the fence and gate improved and the rest of the project started. The current focus is to set up basic living accommodations for volunteers coming to work on the project. PRI has the people power in place to move on this project, but is in great need of funds to purchase supplies. Any financial support is greatly appreciated.

<h3> </h3>
<p>I have been planning this for three years. Continuously walking/hiking from the most southern city in south america (Tierra del Fuego) to the most northern city in north america (Barrow Alaska). No hitch hiking, no car, no bike, or mule. Its been done once before, and i will be the second in history to do so. this trip will take me 3-4 years. It will be a journey. I wil be leaving on Dec. 30th, so i can make it to the southern coast and start my journey Jan. 1st 2014</p>
<p>    While planning i was only thinking how i can benifit out of this experience. Than this year i realized, it is not about me, it is about the people who need help. So i came up with wonderful plan. Help others, and in return have them tell me a story.....</p>
<p><em><strong>SERVICE FOR A STORY....</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><br/></strong></em>So along the way i will be helping others. The one thing in life i love to do. Yes, i will be the second one in history to do this. Yes, i will be breaking a world record. But helping others will be the most gradifiying experience i will tke out of this trip. </p>
<p>I will be documenting the stories. Which every one who follows my group on Facebook will be able to read. I am very excited to hear the stories of people who i will meet and help. I will also be filming a documentary film about the adventure. (Hopefully if could be made into a real film later on)</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The money i am trying to raise will go to this:: 85% will go to the people who i am helping. If its for clothes, shelter, wells, food, supplies, etc. 10% will be back up for emergencies. I have saved the money for gear and airfare. 5% of the money will be used for postage to send memory cards back home. After the trip if there is money left over i will donate it to a childrens hospital. the more i raise the more i help others.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can not imagine the impact this will be on those who need the service i can provide. It overwhelms me that my dream to see the world and to help those in need can be part of one dream. The peoples lives i will impact and the stories that will impact me are just amzing to think about.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cant donate money than please do the following::::</p>
<p>-follow me on facebook and join the group</p>
<p>-maybe be help with dropping off water or food along the way</p>
<p>-a place to stay</p>
<p>-and the most important TELL THREE PEOPLE about this</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the more people follow me and support in anyway,especially with encouragement, the more strength i will have to help others and complete this journey</p>

<p>HOEDSPRUIT
is a small town in the south of the Limpopo province of South Africa, 30
minutes from the world renowned Kruger National Park, and surrounded by dozens
of Nature Reserves and Private Game Farms.</p>
<p>The
community of Hoedspruit has a historical spirit of working together for
conservation and the protection of endangered species by defending South
Africa’s natural heritage. Now, once again this strong and passionate community
have together to fight against the illegal and cruel poaching of rhino, a
problem that is close to exterminating the rhino population in Africa.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687163/files/20140701073217-campf_sign.jpg?1404225137"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687012/files/20140701053654-4966566_orig.jpg?1404218214"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why are rhino being poached? </span><br/>
</h2>
<p>The
reason for this is in some Asian countries Rhino horn is still used as an ingredient
in traditional medicine as it is believed that their horns have medicinal
properties. It is wrongly used to help cure life threatening diseases such as cancer and some Vietnamese also believe that drinking a tonic made from the horn will detoxify the body and prevent a hangover. In traditional Chinese medicine, the horn, which is shaved or ground into powder and dissolved into boiling water, is used to treat fever, rheumatism, gout and other disorders.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/686942/files/20140701050244-Horn_uses_graphic.png?1404216164"" src="""" style=""width: 588px; height: 471px;""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><font color=""#6a6a6a"">Although
it has been scientifically proven that the horn, which is made from keratin
(the same as human hair and nails), has no medicinal properties what-so-ever,
the number of Rhino being illegally poached is growing at a frightening rate.
The value of Rhino horn has increased higher than gold, fetching $65,000 per
kilo, making it economically profitable on the black market. The illegal
trafficking of wildlife products, which generates $17 billion a year, is the
fourth largest illegal trade in the world after narcotics, humans and
counterfeit products.</font></span><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/686945/files/20140701050346-keratin_rhino.png?1404216226"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Shocking

<p>In
2011, I spent 4 months living in Hoedspruit, South Africa. In my time there I
was heavily involved in wildlife and nature conservation and was asked to assist
with the de-horning of rhino on a private Game Lodge. This was part of an area
wide de-horning process that was taking place, in order to deter Rhino poachers
from the area. This was a frightening, incredible and sad experience for me.
The Rhino just looked so sad without their horns, they almost didn't look like
Rhino at all – but it is a temporary and necessary measure that will save them
from becoming victims of brutal and cruel attacks.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687019/files/20140701054056-Renoster_Pic.jpg?1404218456"" src="""" style=""width: 547px; height: 363px;""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I quickly learned that the community had a deep rooted

<br/></div>","A documentary about the community of Hoedspruit, a small town in South Africa, & their extraordinary efforts to save rhinos from becoming victims of poaching.

Background - A Strong Community
HOEDSPRUIT
is a small town in the south of the Limpopo province of South Africa, 30
minutes from the world renowned Kruger National Park, and surrounded by dozens
of Nature Reserves and Private Game Farms.
The
community of Hoedspruit has a historical spirit of working together for
conservation and the protection of endangered species by defending South
Africa’s natural heritage. Now, once again this strong and passionate community
have together to fight against the illegal and cruel poaching of rhino, a
problem that is close to exterminating the rhino population in Africa.

Why are rhino being poached? 

The
reason for this is in some Asian countries Rhino horn is still used as an ingredient
in traditional medicine as it is believed that their horns have medicinal
properties. It is wrongly used to help cure life threatening diseases such as cancer and some Vietnamese also believe that drinking a tonic made from the horn will detoxify the body and prevent a hangover. In traditional Chinese medicine, the horn, which is shaved or ground into powder and dissolved into boiling water, is used to treat fever, rheumatism, gout and other disorders.Although
it has been scientifically proven that the horn, which is made from keratin
(the same as human hair and nails), has no medicinal properties what-so-ever,
the number of Rhino being illegally poached is growing at a frightening rate.
The value of Rhino horn has increased higher than gold, fetching $65,000 per
kilo, making it economically profitable on the black market. The illegal
trafficking of wildlife products, which generates $17 billion a year, is the
fourth largest illegal trade in the world after narcotics, humans and
counterfeit products.Shocking
Statistics
 2009 – 122 Rhino Poached
 2010 – 333 Rhino Poached 
 2011 – 448 Rhino Poached 
 2012 – 668 Rhino Poached 
 2013– 1004 Rhino Poached 2026 – It is estimated that rhino in the country will be extinct if there
is no significant change in the number of rhino being poached. Fighting Back - Rhino Gold Film! Rhino
Gold aims to demonstrate that even the smallest of communities can make huge
differences when they stand together and fight for what they believe in.
Hoedspruit
has come together to do all it can to stop rhino poaching in the area. Many anti-poaching
units has been set up, local farmers have come together to set up a farm watch,
and the community frequently holds fundraising events to raise money for Rhino
Conservation causes.
We must never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has!Rhino Gold will focus on the extraordinary efforts
of the people of Hoedspruit and will include interviews with anti-poaching
units, game wardens, wildlife vets and local residents. Documentary Objectives

natural heritage. To be educated on the needless need for Rhino horn products
and to be inspired by the everyday people of Hoedspruit to go out into their
own communities and start making small changes, but big differences! 
Why I am making this documentary
In
2011, I spent 4 months living in Hoedspruit, South Africa. In my time there I
was heavily involved in wildlife and nature conservation and was asked to assist
with the de-horning of rhino on a private Game Lodge. This was part of an area
wide de-horning process that was taking place, in order to deter Rhino poachers
from the area. This was a frightening, incredible and sad experience for me.
The Rhino just looked so sad without their horns, they almost didn't look like
Rhino at all – but it is a temporary and necessary measure that will save them
from becoming victims of brutal and cruel attacks.I quickly learned that the community had a deep rooted
and historical spirit of working together for conservation and for the
protection of endangered species. I saw for myself first had how members from
all areas of the community, from farmers and housewife’s to vets and shop
owners, came together and did all they could to help save their Rhino. The community of Hoedspruit is a great story and an example to be followed.Rhino De-Horning in Hoedspruit The following is footage that I filmed on a private game reserve in Hoedspruit back in 2011 of the de-horning of 2 rhino.

<p><a href=""www.camp-green-star.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Camp Green Star</a> is a kids summer camp where
kids get their hands dirty with urban farming. 
Camp Green Star is offering its second summer of camp in Madison,
Wisconsin.  I, Mary Eberle, and my

chickens and gardened together for many years.</p>
<p>Last summer, the camp was supported by Organic
Valley, whose support provided scholarships for kids to attend camp.  This support allowed us to accept all kids,
regardless of whether they can pay.  This
summer, we ask for your support to help pay for some of our operating expenses.  This will allow us to continue our tradition
of providing camp to kids regardless of whether they can pay.</p>

<p>Nourish Boston connects people across socioeconomic boundaries with local, healthy food sources to improve individual and environmental health. Through classes, online tools, and outreach, we educate community members about the importance of food choices and teach skills that facilitate continued healthy living.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The EarthTeam Environmental Network, a non-profit
environmental education provider serving low income middle schools and high
schools throughout San Francisco’s East Bay Area, is looking for some support of its Green Screen multimedia program. The Green Screen program consists of 15 Bay Area teens that meet weekly in Richmond to produce
multimedia content related to environmental issues in the Bay Area. Under the
mentorship of the EarthTeam multimedia director, the students learn the
technical points of researching, writing, shooting, producing, and editing
video segments for upload onto the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/GreenScreenTV"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Green Screen YouTube channel</a>. Local TV
station KCRT also runs half-hour programs composed of these segments. <a href=""http://www.thegreenscreentv.net/team.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Click here to learn more about the Green Screen students.</a><br/></p>
<br/><p class=""MsoNormal"">Asthma is a chronic condition affecting the lungs, causing
inflammation inside the airways, as well as bronchospasm (constriction of the
muscle around the airways). The cause of asthma is unknown. Those with asthma
often have certain “triggers” that lead to attacks or asthma symptoms.  The Asthma rates for children in Richmond are
some of the highest in the state of California. 
However, the issue is not just in Richmond, but the San Francisco Bay
Area as a whole.  In fact there are heavily
polluted sections of San Francisco, Oakland, and Richmond, which have become
known as the “toxic triangle.”  Because
the issue affects so many people in the community, The Green Screen students
feel like it is the most important topic for them to address in their next
video.  The Green Screen wants to focus
on triggers of asthma, including vehicle pollution, cigarette smoke, pesticides,
and household hazardous waste products.  <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The proposed video will build on the short PSA that Green Screen 
students produced last fall. This PSA, which was funded by <a href=""http://www.asyousow.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">As You Sow</a>,

<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>

as a compelling narrative short film, appealing to teens and young people, and

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The asthma video will be shown on KCRT local TV, as well as published to YouTube and the Green Screen website to highlight the issue of air quality in the Bay Area, and empower young viewers to make a difference.

<br/>A few  years ago, two engineering graduates grew frustrated 
with the lack of indoor power outlets for people to power devices at 
public facilities and came-up with an idea to build an outdoor table 
with a built-in  solar power supply. <br/><br/><p>The
 SolGreen Evodia SmartTable is an outdoor table that allows users to 
enjoy comfortable outdoor seating and plug devices (Laptops, cellphones 
Tablets) into AC outlet plugs that are built into the table, with the  
SmartTable Mini you can run electronics off of 100% renewable solar 
energy for 24 hrs. This table can be set-up to work anyplace there is 
sun, even in the middle of a remote Desert. Our SolGreen SmartTable also
 has built-in weather sensing technology and an auto power-shutdown 
system to track bad weather conditions and send alerts to weather 
reporting agencies. Over the past few years we have built this concept 
into a working prototype, patented our design, released and sold this 
outdoor Solar Table to a few universities.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><strong> SolGreen Solutions Successful Milestones</strong><br/></p>
<p>Over the past few 
years my business partner and I have continued to work our daytime jobs 
as we grew  our co-founding company, SolGreen Solutions, into a quality 
manufacturing institution.  We incorporated SolGreen Solutions in 2009; 
it's a sustainable energy research and development company that builds 
sustainable technologies for everyday, on the go users.  My business 
partner and I have personally funded all of our operating and 
development cost thus far and we have successfully completed many 
milestones including (1) designed and built  a full working prototype 
for the 100% Solar Table; (2) successfully tested the technology with 
Arizona State University, (3) applied for and received a US patent for 
the technology (4) manufactured and built two commercial Solar 
SmartTables, for Bowie State University and received rave reviews of the
 technology (5) introduced a new product line (Evodia Mini) that has a 
current backlog of three units already sold to some major universities, 
(6) registered our company Trademark with the USPTO, (7) contracted with
 a marketing team to push sales of the Evodia Mini.   </p>
<p><span>NOW We need your help to keep moving, as we introduce our next design and to make this a commercially successful product. </span></p>
<p><strong>Our Next Project-  <a href=""http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001V17Ms4GKzCxKv_-WpkEEKxn309f1O-1wOyz9LjV_6ShpeweVs8RlhKGvAAPyEGmQwC_rDROjM0dCHK5QpR1MiZn-7wZw9A7u3Oj9PzYBPtFyxwslqbrNfSRf95bEC9ggYrQu9S6USQhbP1jQCqMUgnhnEwtmpDST0-nG_asc74IuLQVOrWNJ8z3tcbsJ8KSpsOZ-OHkxLribAB_xX8rEFL_rlVn-VqCLVI1NtiWB7ZzUQzadG5MGslCQCu9IhFbK5pk1muvwNWA=&amp;c=&amp;ch="" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Evodia Mini SmartTable</a></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
 A major risk of the large Evodia SmartTable is the fact that it is 
extremely durable and heavy weighing over 1100 pounds, additionally the 
turnaround time is long and the logistics are expensive, and that's why 
we are building a smaller, and more cost effective model that will have a
 much faster more efficient manufacturing turnaround time. Our new 
SmartTable is titled the Evodai Mini SmartTable and it has all the same 
wonderful features of the larger Evodia, but it's lighter and much more 
affordable for us to manufacture and sell to our customers.</p>
<p><span>  </span></p><p><strong>Why We Need Your Support</strong></p>
<p>

A few  years ago, two engineering graduates grew frustrated 
with the lack of indoor power outlets for people to power devices at 
public facilities and came-up with an idea to build an outdoor table 
with a built-in  solar power supply. The
 SolGreen Evodia SmartTable is an outdoor table that allows users to 
enjoy comfortable outdoor seating and plug devices (Laptops, cellphones 
Tablets) into AC outlet plugs that are built into the table, with the  
SmartTable Mini you can run electronics off of 100% renewable solar 
energy for 24 hrs. This table can be set-up to work anyplace there is 
sun, even in the middle of a remote Desert. Our SolGreen SmartTable also
 has built-in weather sensing technology and an auto power-shutdown 
system to track bad weather conditions and send alerts to weather 
reporting agencies. Over the past few years we have built this concept 
into a working prototype, patented our design, released and sold this 
outdoor Solar Table to a few universities.
   
 SolGreen Solutions Successful Milestones
Over the past few 
years my business partner and I have continued to work our daytime jobs 
as we grew  our co-founding company, SolGreen Solutions, into a quality 
manufacturing institution.  We incorporated SolGreen Solutions in 2009; 
it's a sustainable energy research and development company that builds 
sustainable technologies for everyday, on the go users.  My business 
partner and I have personally funded all of our operating and 
development cost thus far and we have successfully completed many 
milestones including (1) designed and built  a full working prototype 
for the 100% Solar Table; (2) successfully tested the technology with 
Arizona State University, (3) applied for and received a US patent for 
the technology (4) manufactured and built two commercial Solar 
SmartTables, for Bowie State University and received rave reviews of the
 technology (5) introduced a new product line (Evodia Mini) that has a 
current backlog of three units already sold to some major universities, 
(6) registered our company Trademark with the USPTO, (7) contracted with
 a marketing team to push sales of the Evodia Mini.   
NOW We need your help to keep moving, as we introduce our next design and to make this a commercially successful product. 
Our Next Project-  Evodia Mini SmartTable
 

 A major risk of the large Evodia SmartTable is the fact that it is 
extremely durable and heavy weighing over 1100 pounds, additionally the 
turnaround time is long and the logistics are expensive, and that's why 
we are building a smaller, and more cost effective model that will have a
 much faster more efficient manufacturing turnaround time. Our new 
SmartTable is titled the Evodai Mini SmartTable and it has all the same 
wonderful features of the larger Evodia, but it's lighter and much more 
affordable for us to manufacture and sell to our customers.
  Why We Need Your Support

 As with most start-ups we underestimated how much it would take to get 
it to a profitable state, and we underestimated the difficulty of 
getting credit. Now we are right there, we have pushed past many 
milestones and we have some demand for both our legacy and our new 
design (Mini SmartTable), additionally we have built up a backlog to 
several universities in the US and Canada, however, we still need funds 
to fill these backlogs of our new release. In the End, we will make a
 decent profit and we will be able to apply for the banking credit we 
need to move forward with production after we have completed the sale of
 these three units, however we currently need money (seed money) to 
complete these first three units that we have Purchase Orders for, and 
to pay for the  onetime costly molds needed to build the first Evodia 
Mini Prototype. We have already built the molds and three units and now 
we desperately need funding for the remaining balances to purchase the 
Fiberglass and Steel for the Units that have already been sold.
What You Get For Your ContributionIn
 addition to supporting a small, minority-owned start-up, your 
contribution will also help us compete on a global scale and develop 
emerging solar technologies that everyday consumers can use.
   The Impact 
With support from you, SolGreen Solutions will be able to introduce a much needed green technology to  Universities in the US and Canada for users like you to enjoy.  Not only is this green technology a much needed assets on today's stressed power grid system, but it will also allow for a much cleaner and enjoyable setting for thousands of people just like you to power  on the go device from any outdoor remote location 24/7.

The  continued development of the SolGreen SmartTable Mini will:  Create sustainable jobs in the clean energy market.
 Introduce a  quality commercial  product to everyday users like yourself.
 Encourage more developments in the solar energy and sustainable market.
    Risks & Challenges  As with most start-ups we underestimated how much it would take to get it to a profitable state.

will concentrate on how educational practices in different countries can
respond effectively to climate change. We will discuss such questions as, What

regions of the global South have particularly suffered from industrial
development? We want to also take a hard, critical look at our own individual
patterns and behaviours of consumption, which sustain economic growth. We will
explore our own ecological “footprint”. This symposium will build on the “peace
education workshops” which began in 1982 in Denmark. There, professors from <i>TUB</i> came together with Dutch, Polish and

plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now.”</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>For centuries, the abundant forests
of Haiti have been depleted. The growing problem of deforestation threatens the
nation’s environment, energy security, agriculture and, most importantly, the
quality of life of its citizens.  A
Dollar a Tree for Haiti’s mission is to restore the wealth and well-being of the Haiti, one
tree at a time.</p>
<p><b>Support Us:</b></p>
<p>It’s simple: For
every $1 dollar donated to A Dollar A Tree For Haiti, one tree is planted in
Haiti. Founded in 2012 by the former Ambassador of Haiti to the United States,
Raymond Joseph, this nonprofit organization seeks to rebuild the country by
physically replanting it.  With decades
of experience working in the public policy and affairs of Haiti, Ambassador
Joseph saw that reforestation could be a simple solution to a complex problem. The
continuous depletion of the nation’s trees has led to mass erosion that has had
a negative ripple effect reaching Haiti’s environment, economy, and people. The
simple act of planting a tree today, nurturing it through growth, and
preserving it for the future can reverse the effects of the near-destruction of
the land and begin a positive cycle of prosperity.</p>
<p>A Dollar A Tree For Haiti provides a holistic
approach to reversing the negative effects of deforestation by not just
planting new trees, but lifting up the Haitian community in the process. A
Dollar A Tree For Haiti’s unique approach to reforesting the country includes: partnering
with the Haitian Diaspora, committing itself to transparency, working with outside
organizations, and continually encouraging economic growth and development for
the people and the nation. Specifically, with the help of and employment of the
local landowners to plant trees and cultivate the land. In turn, the
reforestation effort will generate revenue for the Haitian people and boost the
economy. Donations will have an impact on Haiti’s physical infrastructure now
and in the future! </p>
<p><b><span>History of Deforestation:</span></b></p>
<p>Deforestation has been a part of Haiti’s
history going back hundreds of years. From colonial-era environmental abuse to the modern day lack of policy aimed to protect Haiti's physical instrastructure,<span> </span>the source of the current crisis is
difficult to isolate. While the root causes and perpetuating actors of
deforestation are valuable to understand, the path leading to a prosperous
future is the most important consideration for A Dollar A Tree For Haiti.  </p>
<p><b>Consequences of Deforestation:</b></p>
<p>Deforestation of Haiti has resulted in severe deleterious
consequences. Dams, irrigation systems, roads, and coastal marine ecosystems
are also greatly affected by the erosion caused from lack of trees. The
productivity of the land and the droughts which come as a consequence of
erosion have resulted in parts of Haiti approaching total desertification. This
is a factor that has led to political instability, poverty, food scarcity, and
vulnerability to hurricanes, lack of development, poor infrastructure, deaths,
and more.  </p>

<h3>Shark-Con</h3>
<p>As avid scuba divers and ocean conservationists, we wanted to create an event where like minded people could gather as a community. This community has the power to inspire the general public and educate them on the importance of ocean conservation. The visionaries for this project come from a background working in the marine science field and in AZA accredited aquariums. We have seen the power of educating the public and have also seen how powerful an experience can be when its entertaining.</p>
<p>Shark-Con will have an amazing line-up of speakers like Dr. Eugenie Clark, stars of Discovery and Nat Geo channels, and other professionals speaking on conservation issues.  Scuba experts, special dive trips, robotic sharks, demonstrations, art, films, and more will make this an event like no other! Together we could bring national and international attention to the need for ocean conservation and marine research.</p>
To get Shark-Con started, we need to raise $5000. Once we are there we will be ready to book exhibitors. Commitments from speakers have already been given and they are ready to get here as soon as we give the word.</div>

Shark-Con will have an amazing line-up of speakers like Dr. Eugenie Clark, stars of Discovery and Nat Geo channels, and other professionals speaking on conservation issues.  Scuba experts, special dive trips, robotic sharks, demonstrations, art, films, and more will make this an event like no other! Together we could bring national and international attention to the need for ocean conservation and marine research.
To get Shark-Con started, we need to raise $5000. Once we are there we will be ready to book exhibitors. Commitments from speakers have already been given and they are ready to get here as soon as we give the word.

<li>Established in 1991, Texas Campaign for the Environment (TCE) is one of the <b>largest grassroots environmental organizations in Texas with more than 40,000 members</b>. We work on sustained, strategic campaigns to reduce waste, improve recycling and keep toxic chemicals out of our land, air and water. What sets us apart from most other groups is our amazing staff of door-to-door organizers who care passionately about protecting our planet and work hard every day, educating and talking face-to-face with tens of thousands of Texans every year. We have members from Amarillo to McAllen; El Paso to Texarkana. Through the canvass, Texans write 85,000 letters a year to decision-makers in corporations or in state and local government to provide the consumer or constituent pressure that makes polluters and elected officials pay attention. </li>

<p><b>Rayovac is one of the four largest battery makers in the U.S. market and they tell their customers here to throw their batteries in the trash</b> - but to recycle them in Canada and Europe. Landfilling or incinerating batteries means those resources are wasted when they could be recycled, and disposal can leak toxic chemicals into our environment. Unlike Duracell, Energizer and Panasonic, Rayovac has refused to make any public commitments on recycling, especially for alkaline batteries. Wisconsin-based <b>Rayovac is the last holdout in a battery industry that is starting to support recycling programs for alkalines and rechargeable household batteries.</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/692798/files/20140703145651-battery_waste.jpg?1404424611"" src="""" style=""width: 525.6816976127321px; height: 394px;""/></p>
<p></p>Our goal is to work with manufacturers and retailers to establish convenient recycling programs, not just in Texas, but all over the U.S. We are so close to being one step closer to victory, and your support is needed more than ever to send committed recycling activists to Madison to get the word out with our local allies. </li>
<li>
<b>Texas Campaign for the Environment (TCE) has won many victories in the past by attracting national media coverage around our theatrical, creative direct actions targeting corporate polluters. </b>Wisconsin-based Rayovac is the only major battery maker that does not publicly support household battery recycling, so we are pressuring the company to take responsibility for the products it creates. Rayovac’s parent company Spectrum is a corporate sponsor of a festival in Madison on July 26 and we plan on sending a clear message to the world that the company should not be lagging behind the other mayor battery makers on battery recycling. </li>
<li>
<b>Over 3 billion batteries are thrown away in the U.S. each year, including 150 million rechargeable batteries -  250 million pounds worth</b>. Once Rayovac changes their policies, all of the major battery makers will be publicly on record supporting U.S. battery recycling. This will provide the momentum to get battery recycling legislation passed in key states and a nation-wide battery recycling system in place. Retail stores and local government facilities will serve as drop-offs for these products without being burdened with the cost of  shipping and processing them. Making the producers responsible for recycling also helps them internalize the costs of waste and gives them an incentive to design greener, better products!</li>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Our Vision for the Climate Justice Hub</span></h2>
<p>This summer, we want to launch a project called “the Climate Justice Hub,” a student-run community space in Boston to intensify the climate movement in New England. The Hub will be active 7-days-a-week from June through August of 2013, in Somerville, MA.</p>
<p>The space will help maintain the momentum among local students in Boston, who have been leading incredible direct actions all year. From locking themselves in TransCanada’s corporate office to organizing thousands to attend the Forward on our Future march in Washington, DC, students and young people in New England are putting their time and bodies on the line to build a climate justice movement.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em> </em></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>What Will Happen at the Hub?</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Six student staff will facilitate the space, with an explicit focus on four key areas: leadership development, campaign planning, creative direct actions, and relationship-building.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><em>Leadership Development</em></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To ensure the Hub has an impact that lasts beyond the summer, the student staff will focus on developing leadership and building capacity within the Boston-area climate justice movement.</span><strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Student staff will work with community organizations to host organizing trainings and workshops throughout the summer. Cultural diversity trainings and exercises will be held throughout the summer, incorporating inclusive values into the ongoing activities at the space. The student staff will also bring in leaders from communities directly impacted by fossil fuels, academia and local social justice organizations for events, discussions, and trainings. Participants will be encouraged to organize their own events, workshops, and skillshares in The Hub space, and offered student staff support as necessary.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>At the end of the summer, our goal is to have built power by deepening leadership and spreading skills across the Boston-area climate justice community. The six student staff will also grow as leaders, returning to their campuses in the fall with new skills, community connections, and a fuller understanding of the craft of organizing as a result of their experience in the Hub.</span><strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><em>Campaign Planning</em></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Hub will provide a home for new and existing grassroots campaigns, host strategy sessions and action planning meetings, and provide a place for citizen activists to connect with local social justice organizations.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Student staff members have already identified several existing campaigns that they plan to spend time on:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></span>Locally, student staff will help bring fossil fuel divestment to the city/state level, focusing on reinvestment in a way that connects with local social justice organizations’ existing goals and projects.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Regionally, student staff will focus on campaigns such as Boston-area transit justice, shutting down the Brayton Point coal power station, or pushing for the completion of Cape Wind.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On the national stage, student staff will contribute time towards campaigns such as stopping the Keystone XL pipeline or pressuring Bank of America to divest from coal.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p dir=""ltr""><span><strong id=""docs-internal-guid-45581428-d8e8-b25e-19d9-7421f4a7578a""><br/></strong>In addition, the space and resources of The Hub will be available for community members wishing to work on other existing campaigns or launch new ones. Allowing all of these efforts to share space and resources will create a dynamic environment ideal for facilitating strategic and well-coordinated campaigns.<br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><em>Creative Direct Action</em></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Hub also intends to be a basecamp for creative direct action planning. The Hub will provide materials and a creative space for arts and culture workshops and large scale art builds.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Hub student staff and community members will arrange large non-violent direct action trainings, and encourage participants to form small affinity groups to provide them with the support necessary to participate in direct actions.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Student staff time will also be put towards helping plan three large-scale direct actions for the region around local fossil fuel infrastructure projects, in conjunction with Fearless Summer, Summer Heat, and the national movement.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><em>Relationship Building<br/></em></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Hub will be a social destination as well as an organizing space. That continuity will enable the development of strong relationships, providing a necessary foundation for effective organizing.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The student staff will work together to make the space inclusive, and incorporate cultural diversity into the activities taking place at the Hub. One of the student staff members will devote her time to intentional outreach and relationship-building between the environmental and social justice communities in Boston. </span></p>
<p>Student staff will also design the Hub as an intentional space for new activists to enter the movement. They will connect new participants to existing organizing groups and support their development as leaders and activists.</p>

Our Vision for the Climate Justice Hub
This summer, we want to launch a project called “the Climate Justice Hub,” a student-run community space in Boston to intensify the climate movement in New England. The Hub will be active 7-days-a-week from June through August of 2013, in Somerville, MA.

From locking themselves in TransCanada’s corporate office to organizing thousands to attend the Forward on our Future march in Washington, DC, students and young people in New England are putting their time and bodies on the line to build a climate justice movement.

Firstly, the park already provides a great place for the community to use, it improves water quality, and increases the value of the surrounding homes.  Secondly, Fairview Park is also one of the few homes to our local sensitive wildlife. Southern California is one of the world’s few biodiversity hotspots- meaning we have a very large number of diverse plant and animal species in an area that is also highly threatened by human activity.  A lot of the species found here are already endangered or threatened due to extreme habitat loss. In order to ensure the survival of what is left in our community, the remaining areas of existing habitat need to be preserved and restored. <br/></span></p>

The Institute for Conservation Research and Education's mission is to restore habitat through the use of community engagement.  The funds earned from this campaign will be going towards the continued improvement of Fairview Park in Costa Mesa, California. Firstly, the park already provides a great place for the community to use, it improves water quality, and increases the value of the surrounding homes.  Secondly, Fairview Park is also one of the few homes to our local sensitive wildlife. Southern California is one of the world’s few biodiversity hotspots- meaning we have a very large number of diverse plant and animal species in an area that is also highly threatened by human activity.  A lot of the species found here are already endangered or threatened due to extreme habitat loss. In order to ensure the survival of what is left in our community, the remaining areas of existing habitat need to be preserved and restored. 
    
There are hundreds of species of animals and plants that are only found in Southern California and Orange County hosts many of these. ICRE, a non-profit organization based in Huntington Beach, is working to restore the remaining areas of space into usable habitat for our remaining species. Specifically, ICRE has launched this Indiegogo campaign to help fund the completed restoration of Fairview Park. This 200-acre area is Costa Mesa’s only wildlife park, and the city only had funding for us to restore a portion of the total area.  

               
However, what we have restored so far has been very successful! The restored portion of the park is not only a beautiful place for park goers, joggers, and locals, but it has become home to many species of local wildlife that would not have any habitat otherwise. In addition to wildlife habitat, the site also provides water quality improvement and treatment for the city. The ponds restored on the site filter run-off water from the city, filtering it naturally and replenishing ground water, instead of having to divert the water to the plant at the Orange County Sanitation District for treatment. In order to further these benefits and continue establishing populations of our local species, the restoration of these spaces needs to continue!  Acres of this area are still filled with weeds and non-native grasses that choke out the beautiful native habitat that houses these species, and with the right financial backing, this area could be fully restored!

(Fairview Park on September 2010)
What happens to my donation? 
As long as we can find money to purchase plants and put them in the ground, the rest of the habitat will do the work all on its own!  After only two years, the first portion of this park was restored and hundreds of species of lizards, frogs, birds, and other animals then settled themselves into the newly created habitat. So with the help of your financial support, 10 more acres of a community park and new habitat could be established and preserved! And for your donations you can receive a number of thank you gifts, and even get a private tour of the park!!  You can even come out and help put the plants in the ground yourself during our restoration planting day- which will be announced soon after the funding campaign!

The price breakdown
We at ICRE have estimated the price breakdown for this project as follows: To restore 10 acres of habitat, at least 1000 native plants need to be purchased (but more is better!). Plants are typically five to ten dollars each, along with getting all the plants to the site, into the ground, and watered. We therefore set our goal at $10,000 in the hopes that, with your help, we can reach that goal and fully restore the entire area! And if we get more than our goal of $10,000 that just means we can restore more acres- there is plenty of space to restore at the park!
                                     
Every little bit helps. Just five or ten dollars can buy a plant or two, bringing us that much closer to our goal.  Even if we are not fully funded, every plant can create a little bit more habitat. Your ten dollars could turn into a giant sycamore, home to hundreds of critters, or maybe some cattails, which filter run-off water everyday. Can’t donate financially but still want to help?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tom Morgan, I am from the UK, but have been wandering the globe for several years, exploring and learning. After being introduced to Permaculture this year I have an urge to learn more, and share this knowledge and these ideas for alternative, more natural and symbiotic ways of living. South america I feel is a great place to do this, indiginous populations hold the fogotten knowledge which can reconnect us with the land, things that need to be relearned in order for us to live in harmony with the earth as we once did, many years ago.</p>
<p>And what better vehicle on which to carry out this adventure than the bicycle, travelling by bicycle slows down a journey and connects you with the place in which your travelling, it is a pure and free means of travel and should be adopted by everyone.</p>
<p>The plan is to cycle from Bogota, Colombia to Patagonia over the following year, visit and work on permaculture projects, local farms, and anything inspiring along the way. I will be Recording my experiences and sharing what I learn with photographs and blogs on my website. <a href=""http://www.wheelingitsouthamerica.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wheelingitsouthamerica.blogspot.com</a> </p>
<p>This trip was well under way untill 2 days ago when my bicycle, which had been lovingly built from scratch here in bogota along with alot of gear, was taken from me by an opportunistic thief. I was set to leave in 2 weeks, but now as I dont have a bicycle and my funds are low this doesnt seem so possible</p>
<p>Your contribution will help me to get set up (again) with the gear I need to hit the road and allow me to carry out this adventure, although partly a selfish pursuit, as most projects inevitably are, I have a real passion to share and promote a different approach to life, trying to re-connect us humans with the natural world and re-discover our true place within it. If i inspire just 1 person to change their life i will be happy.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding I am in need of will pay for my bike and some gear i will need for the trip, for example panniers, rain gear, some camping equipment ect. The gear which was stolen from me. I will build the bike from scratch using second hand components where possible, and some other gear i need such as panniers, lights, clothing, A LOCK, and some other things I can buy at cost price from a friend at a bike shop here in Bogota, anything left over will go towards maintenance and supplies once on the road. </p>
<p>In return I will write interesting insigntful and humurous blogs about my experiences and upload photographs and videos on my website. I will write instructional how-to's on interesting permaculture techniques that can be applied at home. Spread the knowledge and get people inspired. </p>
<p>I will promote cycling everywhere as a healthy green and exciting mode of transport.</p>
<p>Anything will help, even if its $1, if I dont meet my projected goal the money will still go to the same project. it might take a bit longer, and I might need to hunt more thoroughly through the second hand stores for some bargains but your donation will go to the same cause.</p>
<p>I appreciate this is alot to ask and if you cannot contribute but still want to help me you can tell someone about my project, spread the good word by posting a link on facebook or twitter (I dont know how to use twitter so some help with that would be very much appreciated)</p>
<p>Join me on my journey!</p>

After being introduced to Permaculture this year I have an urge to learn more, and share this knowledge and these ideas for alternative, more natural and symbiotic ways of living. South america I feel is a great place to do this, indiginous populations hold the fogotten knowledge which can reconnect us with the land, things that need to be relearned in order for us to live in harmony with the earth as we once did, many years ago.
And what better vehicle on which to carry out this adventure than the bicycle, travelling by bicycle slows down a journey and connects you with the place in which your travelling, it is a pure and free means of travel and should be adopted by everyone.
The plan is to cycle from Bogota, Colombia to Patagonia over the following year, visit and work on permaculture projects, local farms, and anything inspiring along the way. I will be Recording my experiences and sharing what I learn with photographs and blogs on my website. www.wheelingitsouthamerica.blogspot.com 
This trip was well under way untill 2 days ago when my bicycle, which had been lovingly built from scratch here in bogota along with alot of gear, was taken from me by an opportunistic thief. I was set to leave in 2 weeks, but now as I dont have a bicycle and my funds are low this doesnt seem so possible
Your contribution will help me to get set up (again) with the gear I need to hit the road and allow me to carry out this adventure, although partly a selfish pursuit, as most projects inevitably are, I have a real passion to share and promote a different approach to life, trying to re-connect us humans with the natural world and re-discover our true place within it. If i inspire just 1 person to change their life i will be happy.
 


What I Need & What You Get
The funding I am in need of will pay for my bike and some gear i will need for the trip, for example panniers, rain gear, some camping equipment ect. The gear which was stolen from me. I will build the bike from scratch using second hand components where possible, and some other gear i need such as panniers, lights, clothing, A LOCK, and some other things I can buy at cost price from a friend at a bike shop here in Bogota, anything left over will go towards maintenance and supplies once on the road. 
In return I will write interesting insigntful and humurous blogs about my experiences and upload photographs and videos on my website. I will write instructional how-to's on interesting permaculture techniques that can be applied at home. Spread the knowledge and get people inspired. 
I will promote cycling everywhere as a healthy green and exciting mode of transport.
Anything will help, even if its $1, if I dont meet my projected goal the money will still go to the same project. it might take a bit longer, and I might need to hunt more thoroughly through the second hand stores for some bargains but your donation will go to the same cause.
I appreciate this is alot to ask and if you cannot contribute but still want to help me you can tell someone about my project, spread the good word by posting a link on facebook or twitter (I dont know how to use twitter so some help with that would be very much appreciated)

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>In September and October, I will be cycling 2,000 km through Canada as part of a non-profit organization called the Otesha Project (<a href=""http://www.otesha.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">http://www.otesha.ca</a>).  We will be traveling as a 15 person theatre troupe, performing street theater, plays, and hosting workshops for hundreds of school aged children along the way, with an inspiring educational message about sustainability, and how to make every day choices that have a positive effect on our environment!  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Last year, I travelled to 13 countries on Semester at Sea and when I returned I felt disheartened and unsure of how to process the incredible things I witnessed (both beautiful and heartbreaking) and now, I am learning the best way to make a change is to take action, given the gift of this life-experience education.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I am going to be making a documentary as a I travel with Otesha, in order to bring it back to the States to start showing here, in Boulder, Colorado, in an attempt to begin the project here in the States!  You can watch a short video about Otesha's mission here:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViVjnLoE3ZA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Otesha's Beginning"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViVjnLoE3ZA</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Otesha educates thousands of people every year through workshops, play performances, and the Otesha book. The more youth we can reach through the positive Otesha message, the more youth we have committing to making positive changes toward helping the world!!!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As part of my contribution to the project as a volunteer, I need to raise $1,600.00 .  I am putting down $300.00 of my own money to kick start it---which goes toward keeping the project alive, our food, some money for our kindly host families....  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What it does NOT cover is my transportation to and from the project, travel insurance, a bicycle, gear, or money for repairs.  I am aiming to raise<b> $2,000</b> in total to offset these expenses, as I am a (soon-to-be!!!) college graduate with student loans, as we all are :D</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i><b>As a donor, I will send you:</b></i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>a)  a postcard from a location yet to be determined in Canada!!!</p>
<p>b) a copy of my documentary upon its completion</p>
<p>c) love notes in the form of emails, updating you on the progress of the project</p>
<p>d) the opportunity to be listed in the credits for the documentary!</p>
<p>e) warm, fuzzy feelings, along with youtube videos of my team dancing on the sides of highways.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>-GEAR DONATIONS!</p>
<p>        If you or your organization would like to donate a 50 cm road bike, panniers, front and back bike lights, a bright orange vest, a single person tent, sleeping pad, anything gear-ish for touring, that would be BOMB!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>-SPREAD THE WORD!</p>
<p>       I can't help but gush about the amazing work Otesha is doing in Canada.  Let people know, if you think this is cool!  Also, I could use all the support I can :D</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>-SEND PRAYERS SO THAT WE ALL RIDE SAFELY!  </p>
<p>      I promise I'll wear my helmet.</p>

pleasant smelling pheromone, muscone, which is used both in traditional Chinese
medicine and by the perfume industry. Unfortunately, the deer have been hunted
to near extinction in pursuit of this valuable material and as a result are now
listed as an endangered species. Nick aims to provide an alternate, economically
viable method of producing muscone in order to save the musk deer.<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p>Preliminary work in the our lab has demonstrated the
viability of a four step preparation of muscone. Nick's work will focus on identifying reaction
conditions that will improve the preparation by balancing two important
factors: environmental impact and overall yield. As an example the current reaction used to
prepare one of the intermediates uses a common but environmentally unfriendly
reagent. He will explore alternative conditions
for this reaction to avoid the harmful reagent. He will also seek to identify reaction conditions that maximize the yield
of each step, which will minimize the environmental impact of the preparation
and reduce the overall cost of producing muscone.<p><br/></p><p></p><p>Through the course of this summer
research project Nick will:</p>
<p>1. 
Improve the conversion of a
Grignard reaction by studying alternate initiating reagents. </p>
<p>2. 
Identify oxidation
conditions that will optimally balance environmental impact with overall
reaction yield.</p>
<p>3. 
Improve the conversion of a
linear ketone into a cyclic ketone by investigating catalyst choice, solvent, and
temperature.</p>
<p>4. 
Fully characterize all
compounds in preparation for a publication.</p><p>*More importantly, by participating in summer research Nick will gain valuable experience that will will improve his career and educational options post-graduation, and it will also help him to be better informed to make decisions regarding his future career path.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span></p><p></p>Musk deer are endangered due to mankind’s pursuit of
its natural musk (muscone). A population
of 6000 musk deer is currently held in captivity, while as few as 300 are
believed to survive live in the wild. According to a 2012 Science article the
combination of the limited supply of musk with continued high demand provides a
clear need for an economically viable synthesis of this material.  (Cao,
S.; Feng, Q. <i>Science</i>, <b>2012</b>, <i>335</i>, 1168.)  Providing a cheap source of
this compound would remove the incentive to hunt the animal and may as a result
enable it to return to the wild.

pleasant smelling pheromone, muscone, which is used both in traditional Chinese
medicine and by the perfume industry. Unfortunately, the deer have been hunted
to near extinction in pursuit of this valuable material and as a result are now
listed as an endangered species. Nick aims to provide an alternate, economically
viable method of producing muscone in order to save the musk deer.What We Need & What You GetPreliminary work in the our lab has demonstrated the
viability of a four step preparation of muscone. Nick's work will focus on identifying reaction
conditions that will improve the preparation by balancing two important
factors: environmental impact and overall yield. As an example the current reaction used to
prepare one of the intermediates uses a common but environmentally unfriendly
reagent. He will explore alternative conditions
for this reaction to avoid the harmful reagent. He will also seek to identify reaction conditions that maximize the yield
of each step, which will minimize the environmental impact of the preparation
and reduce the overall cost of producing muscone.Through the course of this summer
research project Nick will:
1. 
Improve the conversion of a
Grignard reaction by studying alternate initiating reagents. 
2. 
Identify oxidation
conditions that will optimally balance environmental impact with overall
reaction yield.
3. 
Improve the conversion of a
linear ketone into a cyclic ketone by investigating catalyst choice, solvent, and
temperature.
4. 
Fully characterize all
compounds in preparation for a publication.*More importantly, by participating in summer research Nick will gain valuable experience that will will improve his career and educational options post-graduation, and it will also help him to be better informed to make decisions regarding his future career path.The ImpactMusk deer are endangered due to mankind’s pursuit of
its natural musk (muscone). A population
of 6000 musk deer is currently held in captivity, while as few as 300 are
believed to survive live in the wild. According to a 2012 Science article the
combination of the limited supply of musk with continued high demand provides a
clear need for an economically viable synthesis of this material.  (Cao,
S.; Feng, Q. Science, 2012, 335, 1168.)  Providing a cheap source of
this compound would remove the incentive to hunt the animal and may as a result
enable it to return to the wild.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a dedicated and dynamic team who direct a young Ecuadorian non-profit organisation named Fundación Fauna de la Amazonía (FFDLA) (<a href=""http://www.amazoniarescue.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazoniarescue.org</a>) that works for the protection of wildlife and wild areas in Ecuador. Two years ago we set off on a new venture working specifically towards the protection of forested land in the buffer zone of the Llanganates National Park near Mera in the Pastaza Region by obtaining title to a 37.5 hectare piece of land in the area. This land is within the Llanganates Sangay Ecological Corridor, an area granted special recognition as a ""Gift to the Earth"" by the World Wildlife Fund in 2002 for its mega diversity and importance to world ecology. The majority of the water resources of the region originate in the Llanganates Mountain Range, flowing down and joining bigger rivers farther along, such as Rio Pastaza and Rio Napo, which are tributaries of the great Amazon River. Huge numbers of towns, communities and businesses are provided for from these sources.  It is a hotspot area where vast numbers of fascinating species of orchids and plants, insects, frogs and other animals including Andean bears, tapirs, jaguarundis, tamarin monkeys, and emblematic birds such as the cock of the rock and the umbrella bird, correlate to form astonishing ecosystems which are still yet to be studied in depth – new species of animals and plants are being discovered here every year. Unfortunately, however, the area is deteriorating due to tree-felling, intensive animal hunting, contamination, inappropriate land use including unsustainable agricultural practices, and lack of sustainable opportunities for local community members. We are working to develop a wildlife conservation centre on the land to implement research, wild animal rehabilitation and release, community development and educational programmes, and increase established protected areas. Our objective is to protect and enhance the area working with members of the local community and other groups that work in the area and to spread awareness about the importance of these ecosystems for the future of our communities worldwide.</p>
<p>When we acquired title to the 37,5 hectare piece of land we were only able to pay for around 50% of the total price. The owner approved the deed transfer, urged by his desire to conserve the land that he had lived on from for more than 30 years. This left us $10500 (USD) to find. Since then we have raised funds to pay a further $5000, leaving a final amount of $5500 to be paid before the end of May 2012. We are reaching out to all passionate animal, plant, life and nature lovers to help us raise this amount by the start of May. By contributing you will help ensure the survival of thousands of animal and plants species and communities and you will give us the support we need, afterwards, to develop a model wildlife conservation centre to benefit the wildlife and natural resources of Ecuador and of the World. Together we can change the World!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By protecting this land there will be an increase in land protection and biodiversity, including attracting further land purchase for conservation. We will use publicity on a national and international basis to generate further investment to protect this area which is so important for world ecology. It will allow our team to actively develop priority activities in the area including increased environmental awareness, the production of inventories of native animals and plants, and land management and community development plans.</p>
<p>If we aren’t able to raise the mentioned funds we will be forced to expend most of our current budget and we will not be able to action the activities which are vital to support the continued existence of the wild animals and plants, natural resources and communities of this important area.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to pay the final instalment on the 37.5 hectare piece of forested land that FFDLA works to protect. We have already raised funds and paid for around 70% of the total price of the plot, leaving a remaining amount of $5500 to be paid before the end of May 2012.

(IAE)!
Every year 2041 takes
a team of ~ 40 carefully selected individuals from around the world on a voyage
down south to Antarctica to inspire and engage the next generation of
leadership for a sustainable future.

 WHAT? is 2041!

2041 Ltd  is a
non-profit organization led by Sir Robert Swan, dedicated towards the
preservation of Antarctica by the promotion of recycling, renewable energy and
sustainability to combat the effects of climate change on earth.
2041 led its first
corporate organization  in the year 2003 and since then taken over 1000 corporate leaders, educators, students and entrepreneurs
from around the world on its 'LEADERSHIP ON THE EDGE' program at Antarctica.

It is time to start a movement and be united on this
noble journey!
WHO? is Sir Robert Swan!                                       Sir Robert Swan, OBE,
is the first man in history to walk to both the North and South Poles and
founded 2041. He is an environment leader, polar explorer and public speaker,
who has dedicated his life to preservation of Antarctica- the last pristine
continent on this earth.
Robert Swan through his
Leadership program has been successful in removing 1,500 tons of rubbish from
Antarctica.         WHO? is going!                                                 My name is Yashvika Mittal, an engineer by
education, a sales consultant by profession but fore-mostly an environmentalist
at heart. Even as a child garbage, dirt, pollution, resource wastage and the carefree attitude of the people with it bothered me and hence I decided to work for the cause and bring the change that I want to see. Now I feel very proud to be joining Sir Robert Swan and his team to engage people world over in this mission of sustainability. The Greatest Threat To Our Planet Is The Belief That SomeoneElse Will Save It!


Post the expedition, as
an Antarctic Youth Ambassador my mission would be to educate people on Waste management with the hope that we make electricity out of garbage in the near future. We must join hands to imbibe the mantra of
4R's- Refuse, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.

Why? save Antarctica!
Antarctica, without  any native
population or governance, is today ruled by an International treaty which prohibits
mining and drilling until  the year  2041, post which
this agreement can be altered, changed, modified, or even abandoned. As the year 2041
quickly approaches, we must ensure that this last wilderness must be left untouched from any human activity.
Let us all Save Antarctica Together!
Did you know:
·  More
than 99 percent of Antarctic blue whales have been killed by commercial whalers
during the 20th century (From 250,000 Whales, the total has dwindled down to
fewer than 400).
·  The
West Antarctica region is shedding a Mount Everest equivalent amount of ice
every two years
·  Enough
Ice Has Melted in Antarctica to Alter the Earth’s Gravity
·  If
the Antarctic ice sheets were to melt, sea level would rise 60 meters or 200
feet, affecting  600 million people living on land that will go below sea
level or regular flood levels by the end of the century
HOW?- can we all contribute!

Our aim is to introduce the creativity, diversity and urgency of climate and renewable energy-related science, while both literally and figuratively meeting communities where they are.</p><p>In the late spring of 2015, scientists Elizabeth Case and Rachel Woods-Robinson launched Cycle for Science with a <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/what-two-women-on-a-cross-country-bike-ride-want-girls-to-know-441747523795"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bicycle ride across the United States</a>, teaching hands-on lessons about solar energy and physics to &gt;1,000 students. Two years later in 2017, Johanna Heyer and Kelly Jiang joined Rachel in a pilot week-long Cycle for Science through the California Central Valley, reaching another 1,000 students.</p><p>Fast forward two more years to 2019, and Cycle for Science is returning for a double whammy! A bi-Cycle for Science! This time, <strong>Rachel and Elizabeth are independently launching their own week-long trips, back-to-back on two different continents</strong>. These tours will focus on two unique themes: solar energy materials engineering, and the past and present climate.</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>C4S Netherlands → Materials</strong>: During our first international trip, Rachel will be joined by two female professors (!) Prof. Mónica Morales Masis and Prof. Rebecca Saive, as well as mathematician Lennart Bastian, to traverse the Netherlands and teach about solar cell materials science using a make-you-own dye-sensitized solar cell lesson.</li>
<li>
<strong>C4S Hudson River → Glaciers</strong>: Elizabeth Case and colleagues from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory will lead a trip through New York's Hudson River Valley, stopping in schools to teach students how ice moves and shapes landscapes using ""glacier goo"" demos.</li>
</ol><p> </p><p>To accomplish these two ambitious trips and bring our interactive lessons into every classroom, <strong>we need your help</strong>.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www,cycleforscience.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566689088/tcbpk90mat5fw7i08cqj.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">motivation</h2><p>Ok so what exactly is Cycle for Science? And — you’re probably wondering — why are we crazy enough to do this darn thing <i>for a third and fourth time</i>?</p><p><strong>Climate change continues to ravage our world</strong>, and we are still nowhere near a global solution. The <a href=""https://www.co2.earth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ppm of carbon dioxide</a> in our atmosphere has soared to at least 410 ppm. Global temperature has risen by at least <a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">0.85ºC since 1880</a>, and will continue to rise if we do not dramatically change the way we use and generate energy. We have witnessed global disasters brought about by our inaction, such as the ongoing fires devastating the Amazon, melting in the Arctic and Antarctic, and devastation by drought and floods of homes and cities worldwide. Now more than ever, the world urgently needs politically conscious scientists and creative STEM innovation in renewable energy fields.<strong> </strong>We believe this starts with science and mobilizing the next generation.</p><p>As scientists, we strongly believe that <strong>it is our duty to share the pressing need for renewable energy and climate research with the public, and to reach out to younger generations to get them excited about science</strong>. In today's political climate, when the very idea of facts and objective knowledge is under attack, it is increasingly important to stand up for science, and to inspire the next generation of scientists to keep working toward an inclusive, sustainable, and equitable future.</p><p>Additionally, women and people of color are <a href=""http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/Why-So-Few-Women-in-Science-Technology-Engineering-and-Mathematics.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">still highly underrepresented in STEM majors and STEM careers</a>. <strong>We need a diverse working body of scientists and scientifically literate citizens to come up with creative solutions to the world’s most pressing issues, such as climate change.</strong></p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">mission</h2><p>Cycle for Science brings interactive, renewable-energy and climate change focused science lessons to communities by bicycle. Our driving mission (well, bicycling mission) is fourfold:</p><ol>
<li>Introduce the next generation of global scientists and citizens to <strong>renewable energy, climate science, and basic physics</strong>, in a way that is creative, hands-on, and culturally relevant.</li>
<li>Bring young, diverse scientists into classrooms across the country to provide students with <strong>real examples of who scientists are, what they do, and why they do it.</strong>
</li>
<li>Enable scientists to <strong>learn from and connect with communities outside academia</strong>.</li>
<li>Demonstrate to students and scientists, via our trip (centered around a carbon-free energy generation method ... pedal power!), that <strong>science is an epic adventure</strong>. That’s what makes it exciting.</li>

The new feature of this lesson will incorporate materials physics and device challenges that Mónica and Rebecca research in their laboratories at the University of Twente, and Rachel researches as part of her 2019 ThinkSwiss research fellowship at EPFL. We will have an activity where <strong>students assemble their own dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using very simple ingredients</strong>: raspberries, pencils (graphite), titanium dioxide paste (what’s in mineral sunscreen), an electrolyte solution. Although these are very low efficiency cells, their development has paved the way for perovskite photovoltaics (PV) and their simplicity allows for a safe interactive lesson. With two generous donations from <a href=""https://www.epfl.ch/labs/pvlab/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EPFL’s PV-Lab</a> and <a href=""http://hilyte-power.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hiLyte Power</a>, we will compare the properties of our DSSCs with a variety of other Si and thin film cells, both commercial and research modules, and then have students test some of these cells using multimeters and the Sol Cycle. This comparison will give a sense of the <strong>materials challenges required to make a high performing solar cell</strong>. We will use this hands-on activity as a launching point to discuss real-world challenges of PV, including grid integration, and the need for energy storage.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566687189/gszovxpn2zexqhzxh4ri.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) device schematic, materials we’ll be using for the lesson, the lesson in action, and an array of DSSCs in action.</i></p><p><br/>This is also the <strong>first Cycle for Science excursion outside of the United States</strong>.

The classroom-portion of the lesson will use a variety of hands-on activities to demonstrate natural climate cycles, glacier flow, and how glacier geology is formed. After, we will take students outside and look at evidence of the Laurentide ice sheet like glacial striations, rounded hilltops, glacial erratics and meltwater channels (like the Hudson River). <strong>Students will learn that the land is history, and that evidence of the massive changes that happen in Earth’s geologic cycle remain in their backyards</strong>.

</div><p>And some of our most memorable moments:</p><ul>
<li>A group of fifth grade girls came up to us after our lesson in Boise, ID, and started flooding us with questions about science. One girl marched up and asserted: <strong>“I want to do what you do when I grow up.”</strong> We asked her what she meant, and she replied “bike across the country AND be a scientist!”</li>
<li>At the end of a lesson in Philadelphia with a group of Burmese refugee students, an eleventh grader who'd initially boasted ""I hate science"" told us, bright-eyed, that she was now interested in <strong>studying the role of international relations in renewable energy and science</strong>, and maybe going to college to do so.</li>
<li>On the same day we climbed the Great Divide in Wyoming, we came nearly face to face with a <strong>GRIZZLY BEAR</strong> on the side of the road, and made lingering eye contact. Fortunately for us, it was distracted by the rodent dangling out of its mouth. We felt an intense fight or flight moment — we chose the latter, and raw adrenaline pushed us up the rest of the Rockies to the highest point of the entire trip (10,000 feet).</li>
</ul><p>Because of our work with Cycle for Science, Elizabeth and Rachel were selected in 2016 to be part of the inaugural class of the SHIFT Emerging Leaders Program (ELP), and were finalists for the 2016 SHIFT Youth Leadership Award. And the Cycle for Science pilot lesson won the Outstanding Outreach Award through Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST), an NSF-DOE Engineering Research Center that studies photovoltaics.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">looking forward</h2><p>We expect these two new projects to be highly impactful in various ways. This fall, we anticipate <strong>direct engagement with at least 2,000 students, the development of two more open source curricula for teachers to use freely, and the training of at least four more Cycle for Science educators</strong>. By using these funds to train educators, we expect the impacts and inspiration to ripple outward across the scientific community.</p><p>Starting with our adapted pilot lesson and this new lesson, we will work with educators to compile an<strong> interactive, regularly-updated online repository of high quality, relevant, hands-on lessons that address the Next Generation Science Standards for renewable energy and climate change</strong>. We already share the Sol Cycle’s 3D printable file and our lesson plan <a href=""http://cycleforscience.org/sol-cycle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">for free on our website</a>, and a variety of different outreach organizations have been using the Sol Cycle as a teaching tool! These include the Lending Library at Cornell’s xRaise, an NSF-funded science outreach program, the QESST outreach library, and volunteer groups in Sweden, Philadelphia, and Indiana. We are working on new lesson plans around making your own “DIY-cycle,” as well as prototyping a “Sol Cycle 2.0.” These complementary goals will link communities with scientists in meaningful, long-lasting ways.<br/><br/>Our ultimate goal for Cycle for Science is to <strong>create a network of diverse scientists who embark on bicycle adventures to connect with their communities about science</strong>.

To contribute to Cycle for Science's future efforts, visit our website and click the ""donate"" button. To check out our adventures, read our xNL blog and xNY blog! overviewCycle for Science is a grassroots solution to address major challenges in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and climate change awareness. We accomplish this by sending early career scientists (aka “sci-clists”) on bicycle tours to teach interactive lessons about their research in classrooms. Our aim is to introduce the creativity, diversity and urgency of climate and renewable energy-related science, while both literally and figuratively meeting communities where they are.In the late spring of 2015, scientists Elizabeth Case and Rachel Woods-Robinson launched Cycle for Science with a bicycle ride across the United States, teaching hands-on lessons about solar energy and physics to >1,000 students. Two years later in 2017, Johanna Heyer and Kelly Jiang joined Rachel in a pilot week-long Cycle for Science through the California Central Valley, reaching another 1,000 students.Fast forward two more years to 2019, and Cycle for Science is returning for a double whammy! A bi-Cycle for Science! This time, Rachel and Elizabeth are independently launching their own week-long trips, back-to-back on two different continents. These tours will focus on two unique themes: solar energy materials engineering, and the past and present climate.

C4S Netherlands → Materials: During our first international trip, Rachel will be joined by two female professors (!) Prof. Mónica Morales Masis and Prof. Rebecca Saive, as well as mathematician Lennart Bastian, to traverse the Netherlands and teach about solar cell materials science using a make-you-own dye-sensitized solar cell lesson.

C4S Hudson River → Glaciers: Elizabeth Case and colleagues from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory will lead a trip through New York's Hudson River Valley, stopping in schools to teach students how ice moves and shapes landscapes using ""glacier goo"" demos.
 To accomplish these two ambitious trips and bring our interactive lessons into every classroom, we need your help. motivationOk so what exactly is Cycle for Science? And — you’re probably wondering — why are we crazy enough to do this darn thing for a third and fourth time?Climate change continues to ravage our world, and we are still nowhere near a global solution. The ppm of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has soared to at least 410 ppm. Global temperature has risen by at least 0.85ºC since 1880, and will continue to rise if we do not dramatically change the way we use and generate energy. We have witnessed global disasters brought about by our inaction, such as the ongoing fires devastating the Amazon, melting in the Arctic and Antarctic, and devastation by drought and floods of homes and cities worldwide. Now more than ever, the world urgently needs politically conscious scientists and creative STEM innovation in renewable energy fields. We believe this starts with science and mobilizing the next generation.As scientists, we strongly believe that it is our duty to share the pressing need for renewable energy and climate research with the public, and to reach out to younger generations to get them excited about science. In today's political climate, when the very idea of facts and objective knowledge is under attack, it is increasingly important to stand up for science, and to inspire the next generation of scientists to keep working toward an inclusive, sustainable, and equitable future.Additionally, women and people of color are still highly underrepresented in STEM majors and STEM careers. We need a diverse working body of scientists and scientifically literate citizens to come up with creative solutions to the world’s most pressing issues, such as climate change. missionCycle for Science brings interactive, renewable-energy and climate change focused science lessons to communities by bicycle. Our driving mission (well, bicycling mission) is fourfold:
Introduce the next generation of global scientists and citizens to renewable energy, climate science, and basic physics, in a way that is creative, hands-on, and culturally relevant.
Bring young, diverse scientists into classrooms across the country to provide students with real examples of who scientists are, what they do, and why they do it.

Enable scientists to learn from and connect with communities outside academia.
Demonstrate to students and scientists, via our trip (centered around a carbon-free energy generation method ... pedal power!), that science is an epic adventure. That’s what makes it exciting.
 c4s Netherlands → materialsCycle for Science Netherlands will expand upon our pilot Cycle for Science lesson, which teaches students about solar energy through a 3D-printed, solar-powered miniature bicycle called the Sol Cycle. The new feature of this lesson will incorporate materials physics and device challenges that Mónica and Rebecca research in their laboratories at the University of Twente, and Rachel researches as part of her 2019 ThinkSwiss research fellowship at EPFL. We will have an activity where students assemble their own dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using very simple ingredients: raspberries, pencils (graphite), titanium dioxide paste (what’s in mineral sunscreen), an electrolyte solution. Although these are very low efficiency cells, their development has paved the way for perovskite photovoltaics (PV) and their simplicity allows for a safe interactive lesson. With two generous donations from EPFL’s PV-Lab and hiLyte Power, we will compare the properties of our DSSCs with a variety of other Si and thin film cells, both commercial and research modules, and then have students test some of these cells using multimeters and the Sol Cycle. This comparison will give a sense of the materials challenges required to make a high performing solar cell. We will use this hands-on activity as a launching point to discuss real-world challenges of PV, including grid integration, and the need for energy storage.A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) device schematic, materials we’ll be using for the lesson, the lesson in action, and an array of DSSCs in action.This is also the first Cycle for Science excursion outside of the United States. By spreading the message of the role of solar energy, and connecting it with our own faces and passions, we hope to inspire more students to start thinking about these time-sensitive problems and how they can put their minds together to work towards a better future.A fleet of Sol Cycles prepping for take-off at a middle school in Sacramento in 2015.This trip will launch on Sunday, September 15 at the Netherlands’ eastern border with Germany and cycle 30-60 miles (~45-90 km) daily to end near Den Helder on Monday, September 23. Our team of sci-clists will teach the first lesson near University of Twente in Enschede (where Mónica and Rebecca are professors), and then traverse the entire country to ride from the east border to the Atlantic Ocean and teach in six classes along the way. Our exact stops and schools are still being arranged, but here is a tentative sketch of the route:Tentative sketch of C4S Netherlands route. c4s New York → glaciersCycle for Science New York will focus on understanding how glaciers shape the landscape and respond to climate, and how natural climate variability differs from human-caused climate change. Cycling through the Hudson Valley, which was covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet 20,000 years ago, we will teach students how ice moves, builds and erases landscapes, and how understanding the past can inform our predictions of the future. The classroom-portion of the lesson will use a variety of hands-on activities to demonstrate natural climate cycles, glacier flow, and how glacier geology is formed. After, we will take students outside and look at evidence of the Laurentide ice sheet like glacial striations, rounded hilltops, glacial erratics and meltwater channels (like the Hudson River). Students will learn that the land is history, and that evidence of the massive changes that happen in Earth’s geologic cycle remain in their backyards. We will disentangle natural changes from current, anthropogenic changes and discuss the future of ice on earth. By comparing the pace of natural climate cycles with the devastatingly quick human-driven processes, we hope to inspire students to help lead climate change adaptation in their own communities.DIY ""glacier goo"" instructions (from CReSIS), a ""glacier goo"" experiment in action (from Mariana Esteves of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory), and a glacier (taken by our very own Elizabeth Case in Glacier Bay during her 2019 summer field research).Elizabeth will lead a tour of graduate students and postdocs from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. This trip will start with a lesson in New York City on Monday, October 7, and cycle 20 miles each day to arrive in Poughkeepsie, NY on Friday, October 11. Here is a tentative route of this trip:Tentative sketch of C4S New York route. teamEach team member is a scientist and avid cyclist, is an expert in their respective fields, and is passionate about science communication: Co-founders Rachel Woods-Robinson and Elizabeth Case teaching  (L) and on the road (R). Elizabeth Case is the co-founder of Cycle for Science, and will be leading the Hudson River trip. She is a Ph.D. student at Columbia University and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory studying how glaciers flow and melt. She is an NSF Graduate Fellow, and has been recognized for her writing and journalism along with her science. She believes strongly in the power of community outreach, and is actively involved at Columbia and through the Juneau Icefield Research Program, a summer trek that teaches undergraduates glaciology and mountaineering in one of the most beautiful places on earth. When she's not outside, she plucks the banjo, speaks gently to her plants, and climbs.Rachel Woods-Robinson is the co-founder of Cycle for Science, participated in the 2017 Central Valley trip, and will be leading the Netherlands trip. She is a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, and is a UC Chancellor’s Fellow NSF Graduate Fellow. Her thesis research, conducted at Berkeley Lab and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), focuses on high-throughput computation and synthesis of new materials for solar energy applications.

In her free time she enjoys horse riding, dancing, gardening and other stuff that involves fresh air. Lennart Bastian's passion for biking and the outdoors began at a young age, but it wasn’t until his childhood friend Rachel introduced him to bike touring that he discovered his favorite way of exploring the outdoors. Lennart joined Cycle for Science for an opportunity to share his passion for the natural sciences and outdoor preservation, as he continues to pursue a Masters degree in Applied Mathematics at the TU Munich.Link to bios of past team members, Johanna Heyer and Kelly Jiang.… and you? We are still looking for qualified and interested sci-clists to joining either of these two trips! We are also looking for sci-clists to pilot their own trips in the future, please reach out if you are interested in starting your own Cycle for Science. budgetWe aim to keep costs low for all parties: the lessons are completely free for teachers and students, and the teacher training is free for participating sci-clists. Our fundraising goal of $5000 primarily covers the costs of (1) lesson materials for Cycle for Science: Materials, (2) emergency funds, travel funds, and lodging, and (3) feeding and housing sci-clists during the trips. These funds will also cover the costs of travel, gear, and promo material, though lesson materials will be prioritized. In the event that we do not reach our fundraising goal, we will cover all costs personally. In the event that we exceed our fundraising goal, leftover funds will be retained for use on future Cycle for Science trips, prototyping future lessons, and expanding Cycle for Science into a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.Below is an approximate breakdown of our costs:
Lessons for Netherlands trip: $1,605.00
Lessons for Glaciers trip: $227.00

<h3>Quest for the Inaccessible Pole Expedition</h3>
<div><p><b>There is something hugely positive going on.</b></p></div>
<p>In February 2015, the <a href=""http://www.ice-warrior.com/expeditions/flagship-expeditions/northern-pole-of-inaccessibility-team-members/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ice Warrior Project</a> is undertaking <b>one of the most significant and ambitious polar expeditions of our time</b>; to be the first expedition in history to reach the<a href=""http://www.ice-warrior.com/expeditions/flagship-expeditions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Northern Pole of Inaccessibility,</a> carrying out crucial scientific research along our journey. </p>
<p><b>The Ice Warrior Project is unique</b>. Founded by Jim McNeill, an accomplished polar veteran with over 30 years's extreme expeditioning, the remaining team-members are ordinary people from all walks of life, with little or no experience of polar explorations, pushing themselves to their limits for the benefit of modern-day exploration and scientific advancement.<a href=""http://www.ice-warrior.com/expeditions/flagship-expeditions/northern-pole-of-inaccessibility-team-members/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></p>

</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">To the very centre of the Arctic Ocean - for the first time in history</span></h3>
<div>The Northern Pole of Inaccessibility is defined as the most distant point from land; the very centre of the Arctic Ocean. Our transect is an 800 mile journey from the northern shores of Canada. As Scientific American put it: ""<i>Of all the places on the surface of the Earth, few are harder to reach than the appropriately named north pole of inaccessibility.</i>"" It remains the last truly significant place in the Polar Regions yet to be reached by mankind. </div>
<div>The journey will take our team more than 80 days, across treacherously unstable sea-ice, in one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth. We will face relentless cold temperatures of -50°C that will freeze flesh in seconds. There will be the ever-present threat of polar bear attack. </div>

<h3>We still don't know enough about global change - you can be a part of changing this</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The state
of the Arctic Ocean is one of the most important unfolding stories of global
concern. The Polar Regions are vital ‘early warning indicators’ of climate
change; the Arctic, for example, is warming at a rate of almost twice the
global average. Yet, ironically, we have only a limited understanding of the
change. Despite satellites and modern technology, the data required to probe
this can only be gathered reliably on the ground. And without this data, it is near-impossible
to assess the impact of our mitigating actions.</p>
<p>Our
expedition is a major ‘citizen science’ project. By going to the very centre of
the Arctic Ocean, we will build a full transect dataset for the first time. Our
mission is to gather frequent, crucial field data on ice composition, thickness
and break-up, to allow leading scientists to better understand the state of the
Arctic sea. </p>

</div></div>","Quest for the Inaccessible Pole Expedition
There is something hugely positive going on.
In February 2015, the Ice Warrior Project is undertaking one of the most significant and ambitious polar expeditions of our time; to be the first expedition in history to reach the Northern Pole of Inaccessibility, carrying out crucial scientific research along our journey. 
The Ice Warrior Project is unique. Founded by Jim McNeill, an accomplished polar veteran with over 30 years's extreme expeditioning, the remaining team-members are ordinary people from all walks of life, with little or no experience of polar explorations, pushing themselves to their limits for the benefit of modern-day exploration and scientific advancement. 

  To the very centre of the Arctic Ocean - for the first time in history
The Northern Pole of Inaccessibility is defined as the most distant point from land; the very centre of the Arctic Ocean. Our transect is an 800 mile journey from the northern shores of Canada. As Scientific American put it: ""Of all the places on the surface of the Earth, few are harder to reach than the appropriately named north pole of inaccessibility."" It remains the last truly significant place in the Polar Regions yet to be reached by mankind. 
The journey will take our team more than 80 days, across treacherously unstable sea-ice, in one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth. We will face relentless cold temperatures of -50°C that will freeze flesh in seconds. There will be the ever-present threat of polar bear attack. 
  
Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things


Our journey will be split into 4 legs, each 20 days in duration and hopefully 200 miles in length. 6 team members will accompany Jim on each leg, skiing for up to 16 hours per day and hauling more than our bodyweight behind us. 
We are not seasoned explorers. The Ice Warrior Project is about training ordinary people from all walks of life, all echelons of society and all nations to become competent, safe modern-day explorers, undertaking ground-breaking, purposeful and worthwhile expeditions. 




We still don't know enough about global change - you can be a part of changing this


The state
of the Arctic Ocean is one of the most important unfolding stories of global
concern. The Polar Regions are vital ‘early warning indicators’ of climate
change; the Arctic, for example, is warming at a rate of almost twice the
global average. Yet, ironically, we have only a limited understanding of the
change. Despite satellites and modern technology, the data required to probe
this can only be gathered reliably on the ground. And without this data, it is near-impossible
to assess the impact of our mitigating actions.
Our
expedition is a major ‘citizen science’ project. By going to the very centre of
the Arctic Ocean, we will build a full transect dataset for the first time. Our
mission is to gather frequent, crucial field data on ice composition, thickness
and break-up, to allow leading scientists to better understand the state of the
Arctic sea. 

The data we gather will be used in partnership
with leading global institutes including: the NASA-funded National Snow and Ice
Data Center (NSIDC), The Met Office, Royal Geographical Society, The Scott
Polar Research Institute, The Norwegian Polar Institute and the Russian Arctic
and Antarctic Research Institute.

</div></div>","This year's class of newborns turns north this March with their mothers. The seasonal migration intersects with an increasingly dangerous industrialized ocean. We are in the ship channel when the migration transits Rhode Island, in a position to be able to help them.Rhode Island Sound is critical right whale habitatTHE BASICSRhode Island Marine Animal Support (RIMAS) uses a fast powerboat to monitor threats to right whales in Rhode Island Sound.  The crew is comprised of a National Park Service field biologist, a Scuba instructor, a paramedic, a NOAA technician, a heavy equipment operator, a crewman on the Martha's Vineyard ferry, a retired Air Force mechanic, a marine engineer, and a licensed boat captain.Last week a small plane pilot volunteered to fly for us. So it's a good crew.The boat alone at the dock in March 2014, ready to goThe goal of our winter 2015 campaign is to fund our fuel budget of $10,000 for the migration months of March, April, and May.We need this fuel to get us out into right whales' migration route, where we can intercede for them, to prevent ship collisions, to locate entangled whales, and to lead disentanglement teams to them. Also to monitor ship traffic to slow it down through the migration area. We have a strong, fast boat, and satphone communication with our network in Massachusetts and Connecticut. All your donations will go directly to buying gas for the boat.THE FIRST WHALE TO BE HUNTED COMMERCIALLY
They were driven to the brink of extinction by centuries of whaling, reaching a low of 100 individuals in 1900. Recovery of the population is being severely hampered by mortalities that could be avoided, if stronger protections were put into place, and existing laws were enforced. Every loss of a reproductive female and her newborn is an especially damaging blow to the population. Thanks to protections under the Endangered Species Act right whales have made a modest comeback to 500 individuals in recent years, but commercial activity along the coast is keeping the species perilously near extinction. Our goal is to see a more robust population, with lower mortality along the migration route.
GILLNETS & LOBSTER LINES ARE A LEADING CAUSE OF MORTALITY


Entanglement in vertical lines and buoys from lobster & crab traps...



Entanglement in gill nets, vertical lines and buoys...
Right whales are the most coastal of whales. Seasonal migration requires them to swim 1,000 miles of ocean choked with industrial activity. 
Fishing boats use thousands of miles of nylon gill nets and the vertical nylon ropes that connect buoys on the surface to lobster and crab traps on the ocean floor, entangling ropes that arc hundreds of feet from the seabed back to floating buoys. In the dark water, at the depths that right whales hunt, entanglements can't be avoided. When a whale runs into one of these lines, the entanglement often delivers prolonged illness, starvation, and a terrible death.
Regulations about when and where commercial fishing can be done is a compromise between protecting the whales and allowing fishermen to earn a living. The gear fishermen are allowed to use is regulated to offer some measure of protection to whales, but the modified gear is not working well enough, and whales continue to die from entanglements in numbers that are preventing their recovery. Until they are afforded better protections, the difficult task of disentanglement will continue to be the option of last resort for those of us trying to protect right whales.
SHIP TRAFFIC IS A LEADING CAUSE OF MORTALITY
Commercial ship traffic in the Providence ship lanes


 Rhode Island ship traffic cuts through right whale habitatRhode Island Sound has a 10 knot speed limit for commercial shipping, but we see ships every day making 15 knots through areas protected by law, at speeds known to kill whales. With a hydrophone and good eyes we can report when whales are in the shipping lanes, and make these ships slow down.

Hydrophones (underwater microphones) tuned for the right frequencies do a good job recording right whales' distinctive voice. This year we'll add a hydrophone to our gear, and lower it at the entrance to the Providence shipping lanes.
Our photos and recordings will be posted at www.facebook.com/mvoceanstate and the website www.riwhale.com. Shipping companies are sensitive to public perceptions, so it is important to spotlight ships that ignore their responsibilities within the migratory area.

Passive acoustic monitoring for right whales in Boston's shipping lanes

Our ship mortality reduction project has a shore-based component; using an AIS application running on an iMac and iPad we are able to monitor ship traffic when we can't be on the water, during bad weather and at night. Remote monitoring does not let us locate whales like the hydrophone does, but it does let us identify speeders and report them to the USCG and to our followers on Facebook. Until they are given better protections from ship strikes, the limited protections they have must be enforced, so we will closely watch Rhode Island Sound for ships that endanger the whales.

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>World traveled, formerly working as a stunt woman, actor, model, filmmaker and massage therapist, (and still doing some of that) I am a passionate lover of nature, with a deep sensitivity to life, while also having a very strong drive and energy to build, create and get things done. An outta-the-box thinker, health enthusiast and activist, I have been supporting organic farming as long as it existed and have reaped the rewards of robust health because of it. I have designed and built an urban farm in Los Angeles, volunteered for LA Green Grounds to put organic gardens in the front yards of low income families in South Central LA, and grown gardens all my life whenever I had the chance. A recent trip to a village in Bulgaria where people still grow much of their food, as well as my growing awareness of the toxicity and corporate control of much of our food supply, has inspired me to make growing my own food a top priority. I left all my city life and work behind to move to the country and build a dream . . . to live in deep harmony with the land and teach others to do the same. I have the vision, and am very adept at getting support to build and create something out of nothing on a dry desert moutainside, based off of permaculture teachings and other innovative types of land managment.</p>
<p>I have found the perfect land in a small town not far from LA, in which the owner is willing to finance (no banks!) and we have agreed to terms that work for me. I am currently renting a room just down the street from the land which will make it easy to continue building and making the land productive while there is no house on the property (and much less expense). I am also writing a regular column about sustainability in the local paper, to create more awareness and support with the locals.</p>
<p>I believe in my abilities and resourcefulness to create all that is needed to build this farm. From work parties and workshops, to building with recycled materials and using what would normally be thrown away to create beautiful and functional structures and environments.</p>
<p>For more information on me and what I've done (films etc.), follow the links under 'What I've Done' below.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I need $10,000 to close escrow, pay insurance and pay one year of property taxes. The land owner has agreed to low monthly payments for the first 5 months in order to get the ball rolling and the first episode of the documentary series shot and edited. $5,000 will be the downpayment, roughly $1500 for insurance, and $1,750 for the first years' property taxes (having this paid for up front will give me time to get things going before I take on that extra monthly expense). I'm estimating the escrow fees will make up the remainder of the money, along with Indiegogo's 4% they take out.</p>
<p>Indigogo will grant all donated funds regardless if I reach my goal, however they will charge a 9% fee if I don't. In the event that I don't make the entire goal, I can still use that money towards the downpayment and insurance.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this NOW instead of waiting until I've saved the money to buy the land myself? A. This land opportunity is perfect, no bank loan, very workable terms, great location, very unique property with tons of potential for what I'd like to create. B. As things change in our society, I feel like growing my own food and inspiring/teaching others to do the same is vital. With the corporate control of our government and food supply, we are losing many freedoms and drowning in unhealthy food and living situations. Help me make a difference by working towards change and inspiring it as well.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>What You Get<br/></strong></h3>
<p>Every level of donation will recieve a unique gift as specified underneath it. From my home made 'Killa Kale Chips,' a card with original artwork and a copy of my song, to Creativity Consultations, workshop attendance, an autographed copy of my book, a tree planted in your name, (with a plaque and a portion of the fruits shipped to you along with a picture of it), a creative farm structure built in your name with a plaque, a guest starring role in the documentary series of your choice, executive producer credit on the documentary series, a link to preview the first episode, and a DVD copy.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe very strongly that organic sustainable farming and permaculture are the way of the future, as well as the solution to much of what ails society. I also believe that the more people learn to do things for themselves, and in harmony with the earth that feeds them, they will find much joy, health, connection to the environment and entertainment in the process. Help me show the world how fun this can be! Your support will not only help me build this farm, it will help to educate many people into believing in what they can do.</p>
<h3>The Documentary</h3>
<p>After the first episode is shot and edited, we will pitch it to the networks such as The Discovery Channel, History Channel, Oxygen etc. If we do not get picked up on any TV channel we will release the series on DVD. ES Films is producing the first episode at no cost, which I will direct. See links below to film and video work I have directed in the past.</p>
<h3>What I've Already Done</h3>
<p>Aside from building an Urban Farm in Los Angeles, volunteering to build gardens in front yards of low income homes in South Central LA, terracing hillsides in the desert, building numerous DIY projects from recycled/found/free materials, writing a regular column in the local paper about sustainability, traveling the world and studying people, their food and agricultural practices, researching extensively, and growing gardens my whole life, I have also produced, directed, written and filmed short films and videos. I have done so for free or very little money by being resourceful and creative (which is a great skill of mine). Feel free to view my IMDB credits and Youtube channels which contain much of my acting, stunt, activist, filmmaking and comedy work. I have also worked as a stunt coordinator and actor/stuntwoman on a Sci-Fi channel film called Red Faction where I was in charge of 19 stuntmen, choreographing 5 fight scenes with multiple people, while also having an acting/action role. This demonstrates my ability to take on large projects and coordinate many things at once.</p>

I am a 3rd year environmental science and engineering doctoral candidate at UCLA. My area of focus is in foreign policy and water security. I will be attending and presenting at the international water conference in Thessaloniki Greece in May 2015 (http://www.bywp2015.gr). 



My mission: To develop cross-cutting renewable energy technologies that provide clean water to developing countries. 


The theme of this project is trifold: clean energy, global governance, and women's leadership. This campaign will allow me to present my research on solar water desalination to international water and energy professionals. From this conference, I will network and gain the support of the participating energy leaders in the development of this device. Ultimately, collaborations and networking among scientists and policy makers are key in creating solutions to ameliorate water and sanitation issues.

Topics at the conference include:



Water Management* (Water Loss – Mitigation Methods and Technologies - Drinking Water Treatment Technologies - Quality Monitoring and Identification - Aquifers Rehabilitation Technologies)

Water Distribution, Modelling, Instrumentation & Asset Management
Climate Change and Water Resources

Wastewater Treatment Technologies and Disposal - Sewage Sludge Management - Water Reuse

Sewerage Networks
Industrial Waste Treatment and Disposal
River Basins Management
Legislation in the Water and Wastewater Sector
Case studies are particularly welcome

Remote sensing



The Model Trifecta


Clean Energy: Solar powered water purification research for off-grid communities

Global Governance: Transparent, accountable, and effective 
Women's Leadership: Empowering women to be decision-makers and leaders in their community

What This Means For You
You will be contributing to the success of providing clean water in emerging countries through the use of clean energy. If you are a corporation, I can put you in touch with the key people that I meet at the conference (businesses and government officials).

The faces behind this project are <strong>Julia, Lhouwie, Pilar and Toni</strong>.</p><p>We are a group of like-minded dedicated young individuals. For us, nature is an essential part of our life and we want to protect it. Most of the people love to travel, to see beautiful places, meet new people, try new food, and experience different cultures that they have not seen yet. That’s why we started Mango Tree EcoHostel: <strong>our main aim is to protect our environment and show the world the local Philipino communities around us</strong>.</p><p>Our vision is to build a place where travellers and locals can meet and learn from each other; a place we can call home, a hostel that is not only a place for sleeping and resting but a centre of cultural exchange that focuses on environmental awareness and protection.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607758493/tyscpzvqnnqrin3nwbc8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>Our trajectory so far</strong></h3><p>One year ago, all our team met again in the Philippines with the goal of making this vision possible. At that time, we only had this dream in our hearts and each other’s backs. We were innocent and inexperienced in a foreign tropical island, we had nothing - not even a place where we could build our ECOHOSTEL! But during this year, many things happened and we have come so far!</p><p> We can proudly count on <strong>these important achievements</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>We have organized <strong>learning sessions in two different local schools</strong> on the island, raising awareness about the importance of reducing the consumption of plastic, proper waste management, and recycling.<br/> </li>
<li> We have shown to more than 1000 people (friends, neighbours, workawayers, school students, etc) <strong>how to make eco-bricks</strong> for building and upcycling purposes.<br/> </li>
<li>We have <strong>recycled by building with eco-bricks for our hostel around 1000 kilograms of soft plastic</strong>: it means around <strong>1500 eco-bricks</strong>! We built our toilet walls out of eco-bricks and clay. We have loads of upcycled plastic as well to produce pillows, chairs, tables, curtains and more.</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607759790/mo3z1axvbpyv0c5yfpll.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul>
<li>We have <strong>organized and participated in several beach, land and ocean clean-ups</strong> with locals and backpackers. In this way, we have been continuing our fight against trash undersea.<br/> </li>
<li>Before the pandemic, we were carrying out a <strong>workaway program</strong> where volunteers from all over the world could come to help us with our initiatives. We were able to create a cultural exchange between our workawayers and our local friends. It became a little community: we lived, cooked, and celebrated together- and we made our first steps at the construction site – which was really hard work!<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>We have already built 80% of the buildings to complete the hostel</strong>. We were able to hire an average of 10 local bamboo construction workers for around 8 months. This way, we are preserving the knowledge of traditional construction with bamboo. Knowledge that was being forgotten in the area due to the cement industry becoming the main type of construction in the last decades.<br/> </li>
<li>A German camera team from BluePrintMedia Production visited us in the Philippines to record our exciting journey for a documentary.</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607759815/wqj7yn8tqbmd9ro1ufp5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The pandemic hasn’t made it easier for us: over a few months, we had to freeze construction, and the feeling of uncertainty around travelling has been like a bad joke for our dreams.</p><h3><strong>Our plan B: Open a little local cafe</strong></h3><p>Our initial plan was to open by summer, offering accommodation and breakfast to our first guests, and slowly starting with the next improvements while the hostel was running. But, as you know, the tourism industry – on which countries like the Philippines are heavily dependent – has been one of the most jeopardised by the global pandemic. The world shut down its borders and so sadly we are not able to open our hostel yet.</p><p>So now with our accommodation facilities ready to be used, we had to be creative and <strong>think about a PLAN B…</strong></p><p>While all of you still have to be at home and may not be able to come here and visit the Philippines, we had an idea: <strong>we want to open a little Mango Tree EcoCafe</strong>.</p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607856022/dysktbpcqa51tucobsmo.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>We want to offer hot and cold drinks, little snacks, smoothie bowls and pastries - all eco-friendly of course!</p><p>On our island, local tourism is actually happening, so we can focus on this sector for now. With our café, we are creating a platform where we can still communicate the mission of Mango Tree EcoHostel.

The faces behind this project are Julia, Lhouwie, Pilar and Toni.We are a group of like-minded dedicated young individuals. For us, nature is an essential part of our life and we want to protect it. Most of the people love to travel, to see beautiful places, meet new people, try new food, and experience different cultures that they have not seen yet. That’s why we started Mango Tree EcoHostel: our main aim is to protect our environment and show the world the local Philipino communities around us.Our vision is to build a place where travellers and locals can meet and learn from each other; a place we can call home, a hostel that is not only a place for sleeping and resting but a centre of cultural exchange that focuses on environmental awareness and protection.Our trajectory so farOne year ago, all our team met again in the Philippines with the goal of making this vision possible. At that time, we only had this dream in our hearts and each other’s backs. We were innocent and inexperienced in a foreign tropical island, we had nothing - not even a place where we could build our ECOHOSTEL! But during this year, many things happened and we have come so far! We can proudly count on these important achievements:
We have organized learning sessions in two different local schools on the island, raising awareness about the importance of reducing the consumption of plastic, proper waste management, and recycling. 
 We have shown to more than 1000 people (friends, neighbours, workawayers, school students, etc) how to make eco-bricks for building and upcycling purposes. 
We have recycled by building with eco-bricks for our hostel around 1000 kilograms of soft plastic: it means around 1500 eco-bricks! We built our toilet walls out of eco-bricks and clay. We have loads of upcycled plastic as well to produce pillows, chairs, tables, curtains and more.

We have organized and participated in several beach, land and ocean clean-ups with locals and backpackers. In this way, we have been continuing our fight against trash undersea. 
Before the pandemic, we were carrying out a workaway program where volunteers from all over the world could come to help us with our initiatives. We were able to create a cultural exchange between our workawayers and our local friends. It became a little community: we lived, cooked, and celebrated together- and we made our first steps at the construction site – which was really hard work! 

We have already built 80% of the buildings to complete the hostel. We were able to hire an average of 10 local bamboo construction workers for around 8 months. This way, we are preserving the knowledge of traditional construction with bamboo. Knowledge that was being forgotten in the area due to the cement industry becoming the main type of construction in the last decades. 
A German camera team from BluePrintMedia Production visited us in the Philippines to record our exciting journey for a documentary.
The pandemic hasn’t made it easier for us: over a few months, we had to freeze construction, and the feeling of uncertainty around travelling has been like a bad joke for our dreams.Our plan B: Open a little local cafeOur initial plan was to open by summer, offering accommodation and breakfast to our first guests, and slowly starting with the next improvements while the hostel was running. But, as you know, the tourism industry – on which countries like the Philippines are heavily dependent – has been one of the most jeopardised by the global pandemic. The world shut down its borders and so sadly we are not able to open our hostel yet.So now with our accommodation facilities ready to be used, we had to be creative and think about a PLAN B…While all of you still have to be at home and may not be able to come here and visit the Philippines, we had an idea: we want to open a little Mango Tree EcoCafe.We want to offer hot and cold drinks, little snacks, smoothie bowls and pastries - all eco-friendly of course!On our island, local tourism is actually happening, so we can focus on this sector for now. With our café, we are creating a platform where we can still communicate the mission of Mango Tree EcoHostel. The furniture will be all upcycled, and we will have zero-waste workshops, cleanups, and the like. Additional to that, bamboo buildings also need maintaining, we can still provide jobs for locals in need and Mango Tree EcoHostel has a chance to survive. As soon as it’s possible to travel again we want to finally open our hostel so that everyone can visit and experience this beautiful island – and help us save the environment.Supporting our project at this point will help us to keep on spreading our vision. Like this, you can still be a part of Mango Tree Eco-Hostel and once the borders are open we hope you can visit us and help us in person!Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot afford to support us economically, there are many other ways you could help: just living an eco-friendly lifestyle and being able to influence people around you is the best way! You can also follow us in social media, and tell other friends about us so that our vision can be shared as much as possible! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Link zum deutschen Video:   https://youtu.be/Pj0VTuvMGmQ Wir brauchen deine Hilfe!Wir wollen ein kleines Cafe eröffnen, um unseren Kampf gegen Single-Used Plastik fortführen zu können.Wer sind wir uns was ist unsere Vision?Falls du uns noch nicht kennst, wir sind Mango Tree EcoHostel, zu finden auf der Insel Negros auf den Philippinen.

<h2 align=""center""><strong>One of the most beautiful and precious places on the Planet Earth.</strong></h2>
<p align=""center""><strong>A community-based conservation program to protect critically endangered lemurs in</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Kianjavato Classified Forest, Madagascar</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">The Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership (MBP) is a Malagasy NGO that conducts its conservation efforts in Madagascar to study, research, foster and protect the ecology of the land and its remaining forests.  </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>More than 90% or Madagascar's forests have been lost in the last century,  which poses a serious threat to the unique biodiversity remaining.  </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Lemurs, which can only be found in Madagascar, were recently declared the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">most threatened mammals in the world</span>. Of the 103 known lemur species, more than 72% are recognized as Critically Endangered or Endangered.</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">MBP's international team of researchers, educators, engineers and scientists are committed to the challenge of preserving the existing forest and expand them through grassroots tree-planting activities. Critical to MBP's effort is to involve the local community in participating in the restoration and monitoring effort.  Long term protection of Madagascar's forests and wildlife, including endangered lemurs, is only possibile with local participation and commitment.  </p>
<p align=""center""><strong><img alt=""Lemurs in their habitat"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.madagascarpartnership.org/media/AA/AJ/madagascarpartnership-org/images/5354641/Lemur.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Lemurs in their habitat""/></strong></p>

<p class=""WordSection1"">  MBP's project has a goal of planting 1,000,000 trees into the fragmented forest landscape with the assistance of Kianjavato's residents. This effort is part of the ""Forest Corridors as Entrepreneurial Opportunities for Madagascar"" initiative that combines reforestation with sustainable agroforestry practices. Protecting the local ecosystem requires more than just reforestation, it requires a holistic approach that supports the community and reduces its exploitation of the forest.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">  Although the MBP is still a relatively young organization, it has made significant progress towards this end:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""WordSection1"">
<em>Promotion of environmental preservation</em> - In the first half of 2012, more than 30,374 trees have been planted into the fragmented landscape. Satellite nurseries throughout the Kianjavato commune, which are managed by area residents that were trained by the MBP, are housing tens of thousands more native tree seedlings in preparation for the next rainy season, a key planting period.</li>
<li class=""WordSection1"">
<em>Engagement of the local community</em> - Over the recent months, it has become clear that word had gotten out about this reforestation program. Not only is local participation and enthusiasm building, but interest is growing from communities outside Kianjavato. Increasingly these residents make the several kilometer-trek on foot to the research station looking for work as day laborers. Working with MBP is now seen as a more reliable source of income than the job of gold mining, which poses health consequences, is environmentally destructive, and infrequently profitable.</li>
<li class=""WordSection1"">
<em>Empowerment through education and community development</em> - Reached hundreds of school children, teachers, officials, and residents through a community program between MBP and Conservation Fusion, an international conservation-focused educational organization </li>

<p class=""WordSection1""><strong>You can help change attitudes</strong> and <em><strong>make change happen </strong></em>with just a small donation.  It's easy to affect change - Even a small donation executed thousands of times over by individual compassionate people like you, demonstrates just how.</p>
<h3>Hello, My name is Kyle.</h3>
<p class=""WordSection1"">  I discovered MBP whilst researching challenging and rewarding employment opportunities and carreer paths for college and university graduates of biology and related disciplines.  My son and daughter namely.   While I was looking for employment/opps abroad for my daughter, I discovered the MBP online.  In addition to hopefully sponsoring my daughter, I wanted to help out with a donation.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">  The MBP Volunteer program offers participants an opportunity to budding-scientists to gain knowledge in endangered species protection.  Volunteers and students will be on-the-ground performing real and meaningful field work in-situ in Kianjavato, Madagascar.  Activities involve helping to monitor lemurs in the remaining forest fragments, assisting with the community-wide reforestation effort, working with Malagasy staff to develop research skills, and develop language skills. Participants commit to a 3-6 month minimum stay, during which MBP provides basic accommodations, food, and transportation to/from the MBP research station.   Funding for the filling of these spaces is typically provided by the volunteer themselves, or by a sponsor.  A detailed accounting of the projects work and activity progress can be read/seen a little further below.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">  However, the project must also receive funding to carry out its mission of conservation, education and sustainable living for communities and thus, it is the aim of my campaign to generate some of this funding.  Currently this funding is provided via private grants and donations from zoos and individuals.  I decided this could be a way for everyone to help out as much as they can afford to.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">  The project acquires tools, resources and labor/manpower as the financial opportunities to do so present themselves. Currently through grants and private donations. Funds are typically spent according to the amounts received but it is nothing short of amazing how much is done with so little money.</p>

<p class=""WordSection1"">   </p>
<h3 class=""WordSection1"">All funding contributions received will go to the MBP whether this campaign goal is reached or not.</h3>
<p> <strong>Perks:</strong>  As MBP is still a developing organization, we are always in a cycle of updates and advancements, thus are perks may be limited. For those who donate and/or contribute to the general project, we will acknowledge them on our website and email project updates to those who sign up.  We are actively developing a system to tie every donation to a specific tree in the ground. Our future goal is to be able to provide each donor with a GPS location that they can take to Google Earth and see where in the world their sponsored tree was planted. We hope to launch a new page on our website that will have a map where people can zoom in and see the location of their tree, the species, date it was planted, and who planted it. This is still under development, but we believe it will be a fantastic tool once available. (If you love our project and want to volunteer - you could help us get this function up and running!)</p>
<p>  Contributors can request and will recieve via email, a breakdown of how funds are allocated and spent via a pair of reports for this year 2012.  They have been provided by the project.  MBP makes very little money go a very long distance.  <strong>My goal is to raise $20,000 to help the project</strong> fund its activities, with a special emphasis on expanding the reforestation effort and other critical components of the program with the greatest need for aid.</p>

<p>Below are excerpts from reports on the project's activities for the first half of 2012.  The reports serve to explain in detail and inform pertinent agencies about the ongoing work and progress of the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership:</p>
<p><strong>MBP Project Overview</strong></p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">  With few viable alternatives, Madagascar’s population continues to be reliant upon several environmentally harmful activities such as slash and burn farming, mining and hunting, all of which threaten the island’s extraordinary species diversity. Due to a lack of effective protection of two critically endangered lemur species in the surrounding forests of Kianjavato, in southeast Madagascar, Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium (OHDZA) and the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership (MBP) established an extensive research project in the area in 2007. Operating under the premise of finding a sustainable path forward for the lemurs and the 12,000 residents reliant upon the surrounding forest fragments, OHDZA-MBP developed a community-based conservation effort, the “Education Promoting Reforestation Program” (EPRP).</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">This grassroots reforestation program deployed MBP personnel to track seed-dispersing lemurs through the forest, in this case the Black and white ruffed lemur (<em>Varecia variegata</em>). While monitoring lemurs, fecal samples were collected opportunistically year-round from which local field assistants extracted and sorted seeds, and planted in nurseries.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">The resulting seedlings were transplanted as part of a community supported reforestation and restoration program that utilized these native trees to restore habitat and enable movement of lemur populations. Once mature, the transplanted endemic trees will entice lemurs to forage and continue the process of forest restoration themselves, thus requiring less future human intervention. Additionally, the structure of the reforestation plan also included tree species with commercial value, thus providing area residents with an additional source of income over time.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">Community awareness and support has increased due to the employment of large numbers of local community members to monitor lemurs, maintenance and preparation of seedlings in the local nurseries, as well as transplantation of trees. Furthermore, the planned distribution of incentive items as part of the conservation credit program, which is scheduled to occur in July 2012, will further strengthen community ties to forest and lemur protection efforts.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><strong>MBP Project Update </strong>Since the receipt of the grant award from the XXX Foundation, OHDZA-MBP made great strides in advancing towards the goals of the grant.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><strong>Promotion of environmental preservation:</strong> The OHDZA-MBP reforestation efforts have enhanced the promotion of habitat protection with more than 30,000 trees being planted into the landscape thus far in 2012, thereby establishing the foundation for vital corridors to connect forest fragments. The eight nurseries strategically located near each participating village housed seedlings prior to transplantation. Community representatives from the immediate area run these nurseries and coordinate future community planting days.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">In addition, the program has led to the creation of contracts between OHDZA-MBP and each village. These contracts are designed to identify the specific location for each community-designated nursery plot, define the contributions of each partner, and clearly states that the land remains in the hands of the original owners.As the program expands its efforts into the larger community, there has been a growing interest in the reforestation of neighboring territories. In fact, OHDZA-MBP has increasingly been receiving requests from communities outside the Kianjavato area for guidance in the construction of nurseries near their village. Not wanting the community-based reforestation effort momentum to stop at the border of the Kianjavato commune, OHDZA-MBP has been working with representatives from these other communities to set the groundwork for their reforestation initiative.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><img alt=""One of many community planting days in Kianjavato"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/400861_450929438292117_1877503278_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""One of many community planting days in Kianjavato""/></p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><strong>Engagement of the local community:</strong> To date, there are a number of fantastic community partners routinely contributing to the planting efforts. These comprise groups that we originally anticipated would be involved, such as area residents, school children and their teachers, village elders, and local officials. This is in addition to the OHDZ-MBP Malagasy graduate students, local assistants and guides, and visiting researchers who are regularly involved with the program on a more official capacity. However, there is growing interest in participating from additional groups, including a local single women’s club, members of which are single mothers whose involvement with the project allows them to contribute to the community and earn additional income.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">These women currently fill the role of weeding the nurseries and making shade structures for newly transplanted seedlings.Over the recent months it has become clear that word has gotten out about this reforestation program. Increasingly, people from communities outside Kianjavato make the several kilometer-trek on foot to the research station looking for work as day laborers. Working with OHDZA-MBP is now seen as a more reliable source of income than the job of gold mining, which poses health consequences, is environmentally destructive, and infrequently profitable.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">Due to the participation of many factions within the Kianjavato community, there is a building of local appreciation for the project as well as its potential for aiding residents and the regional wildlife over the foreseeable future. This acceptance, coupled with a thirst for knowledge, is vital for any conservation effort, and we are very fortunate in this regard and must use it to the advantage of the larger conservation program.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><img alt=""Helping move trees for transplantation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://madagascarpartnership.org/media/AA/AJ/madagascarpartnership-org/images/9384583/Planting_day.jpg?120306104753"" src="""" style=""width: 211px; height: 136px;"" title=""Community planting day""/>   <img alt=""Residents see a demonstration on how to use the planting auger"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://madagascarpartnership.org/media/AA/AJ/madagascarpartnership-org/images/9384383/Community_Auger_Demo.jpg?120306103035"" src="""" style=""width: 203px; height: 132px;"" title=""Demo for community planting day""/></p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><strong>Empowerment through education and community development: </strong>There are a number of new exciting advances regarding other education and community development opportunities. The project currently supports a postdoctoral researcher, who has a Ph.D. in botany and significant experience working with plants in Madagascar, to oversee the Kianjavato research program. Furthermore, in the first quarter of the year we had two international volunteers, with experience in horticulture and project management, spearhead the reforestation program.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">These volunteers worked closely with the nursery managers, day laborers and community participants, teaching them new skills and techniques. The reforestation program made some of its greatest advances while these volunteers were onsite, so in order to continue this momentum, we are bringing two other international volunteers onsite in late June to further manage the reforestation effort and transfer lessons to the local community.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><img alt=""Teaching the community"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.madagascarpartnership.org/media/AA/AJ/madagascarpartnership-org/images/3134131/main/Education_1.jpg?100722103236"" src="""" style="""" title=""Teaching the community""/></p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">To make the most of the project’s growing awareness and community desire for assistance, our partner, Conservation Fusion, is planning a return visit to the communities of Kianjavato. The international NGO will lead another series of education and community development events to strengthen community interest and ability to participate in making a positive impact. Thus far, the advancements in community-relations have been made with minimal presentation of the conservation incentive items such as the rocket stoves and Tough Stuff Kits. However, in July 2012, the OHDZA-MBP is planning a distribution event, where participants in the reforestation program that have earned sufficient conservation credits will be awarded with a Tough Stuff Kit. \</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">This allocation will coincide with an education and outreach event which will highlight the advantages and ease of use of the Tough Stuff items. Although there is growing interest regarding our reforestation program, we hope that the educational activities and conservation credit program will assist us in gathering more support from the community to make the one million-tree effort feasible.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><strong>Grant-specific Update.  </strong>With the grant award from the XXX Foundation for $6,000, we amended the original design and quantity of Tough Stuff Kits that would be made available. The funds enabled us to purchase sufficient components to offer 300 Tough Stuff Kits as incentive items, each with a solar panel and battery power pack (see Table 1).

One of the most beautiful and precious places on the Planet Earth.
A community-based conservation program to protect critically endangered lemurs in
Kianjavato Classified Forest, Madagascar
The Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership (MBP) is a Malagasy NGO that conducts its conservation efforts in Madagascar to study, research, foster and protect the ecology of the land and its remaining forests.  
More than 90% or Madagascar's forests have been lost in the last century,  which poses a serious threat to the unique biodiversity remaining.  
Lemurs, which can only be found in Madagascar, were recently declared the most threatened mammals in the world. Of the 103 known lemur species, more than 72% are recognized as Critically Endangered or Endangered.
MBP's international team of researchers, educators, engineers and scientists are committed to the challenge of preserving the existing forest and expand them through grassroots tree-planting activities. Critical to MBP's effort is to involve the local community in participating in the restoration and monitoring effort.  Long term protection of Madagascar's forests and wildlife, including endangered lemurs, is only possibile with local participation and commitment.  

http://www.madagascarpartnership.org/home/volunteer_program2
  MBP's project has a goal of planting 1,000,000 trees into the fragmented forest landscape with the assistance of Kianjavato's residents. This effort is part of the ""Forest Corridors as Entrepreneurial Opportunities for Madagascar"" initiative that combines reforestation with sustainable agroforestry practices. Protecting the local ecosystem requires more than just reforestation, it requires a holistic approach that supports the community and reduces its exploitation of the forest.
  Although the MBP is still a relatively young organization, it has made significant progress towards this end:


Promotion of environmental preservation - In the first half of 2012, more than 30,374 trees have been planted into the fragmented landscape. Satellite nurseries throughout the Kianjavato commune, which are managed by area residents that were trained by the MBP, are housing tens of thousands more native tree seedlings in preparation for the next rainy season, a key planting period.

Engagement of the local community - Over the recent months, it has become clear that word had gotten out about this reforestation program. Not only is local participation and enthusiasm building, but interest is growing from communities outside Kianjavato. Increasingly these residents make the several kilometer-trek on foot to the research station looking for work as day laborers. Working with MBP is now seen as a more reliable source of income than the job of gold mining, which poses health consequences, is environmentally destructive, and infrequently profitable.

Empowerment through education and community development - Reached hundreds of school children, teachers, officials, and residents through a community program between MBP and Conservation Fusion, an international conservation-focused educational organization 


You can help change attitudes and make change happen with just a small donation.  It's easy to affect change - Even a small donation executed thousands of times over by individual compassionate people like you, demonstrates just how.
Hello, My name is Kyle.
  I discovered MBP whilst researching challenging and rewarding employment opportunities and carreer paths for college and university graduates of biology and related disciplines.  My son and daughter namely.   While I was looking for employment/opps abroad for my daughter, I discovered the MBP online.  In addition to hopefully sponsoring my daughter, I wanted to help out with a donation.
  The MBP Volunteer program offers participants an opportunity to budding-scientists to gain knowledge in endangered species protection.  Volunteers and students will be on-the-ground performing real and meaningful field work in-situ in Kianjavato, Madagascar.  Activities involve helping to monitor lemurs in the remaining forest fragments, assisting with the community-wide reforestation effort, working with Malagasy staff to develop research skills, and develop language skills. Participants commit to a 3-6 month minimum stay, during which MBP provides basic accommodations, food, and transportation to/from the MBP research station.   Funding for the filling of these spaces is typically provided by the volunteer themselves, or by a sponsor.  A detailed accounting of the projects work and activity progress can be read/seen a little further below.
  However, the project must also receive funding to carry out its mission of conservation, education and sustainable living for communities and thus, it is the aim of my campaign to generate some of this funding.  Currently this funding is provided via private grants and donations from zoos and individuals.  I decided this could be a way for everyone to help out as much as they can afford to.
  The project acquires tools, resources and labor/manpower as the financial opportunities to do so present themselves. Currently through grants and private donations. Funds are typically spent according to the amounts received but it is nothing short of amazing how much is done with so little money.
http://www.madagascarpartnership.org/home
   
All funding contributions received will go to the MBP whether this campaign goal is reached or not.
 Perks:  As MBP is still a developing organization, we are always in a cycle of updates and advancements, thus are perks may be limited. For those who donate and/or contribute to the general project, we will acknowledge them on our website and email project updates to those who sign up.  We are actively developing a system to tie every donation to a specific tree in the ground. Our future goal is to be able to provide each donor with a GPS location that they can take to Google Earth and see where in the world their sponsored tree was planted. We hope to launch a new page on our website that will have a map where people can zoom in and see the location of their tree, the species, date it was planted, and who planted it. This is still under development, but we believe it will be a fantastic tool once available. (If you love our project and want to volunteer - you could help us get this function up and running!)
  Contributors can request and will recieve via email, a breakdown of how funds are allocated and spent via a pair of reports for this year 2012.  They have been provided by the project.  MBP makes very little money go a very long distance.  My goal is to raise $20,000 to help the project fund its activities, with a special emphasis on expanding the reforestation effort and other critical components of the program with the greatest need for aid.
However small your contribution - It still means a lot.  If you can't contribute, at least take a moment and look at the MBP website to see their project. Like MBP on Facebook; follow MBP on Twitter; help spread the word about the work that they are doing. Work like this is more important to your children and even more important to theirs.  We cannot save the world in one fell swoop.  We have to find our one place and start there.  We have to give back. 

Below are excerpts from reports on the project's activities for the first half of 2012.  The reports serve to explain in detail and inform pertinent agencies about the ongoing work and progress of the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership:
MBP Project Overview
  With few viable alternatives, Madagascar’s population continues to be reliant upon several environmentally harmful activities such as slash and burn farming, mining and hunting, all of which threaten the island’s extraordinary species diversity. Due to a lack of effective protection of two critically endangered lemur species in the surrounding forests of Kianjavato, in southeast Madagascar, Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium (OHDZA) and the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership (MBP) established an extensive research project in the area in 2007. Operating under the premise of finding a sustainable path forward for the lemurs and the 12,000 residents reliant upon the surrounding forest fragments, OHDZA-MBP developed a community-based conservation effort, the “Education Promoting Reforestation Program” (EPRP).
This grassroots reforestation program deployed MBP personnel to track seed-dispersing lemurs through the forest, in this case the Black and white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata). While monitoring lemurs, fecal samples were collected opportunistically year-round from which local field assistants extracted and sorted seeds, and planted in nurseries.
The resulting seedlings were transplanted as part of a community supported reforestation and restoration program that utilized these native trees to restore habitat and enable movement of lemur populations. Once mature, the transplanted endemic trees will entice lemurs to forage and continue the process of forest restoration themselves, thus requiring less future human intervention. Additionally, the structure of the reforestation plan also included tree species with commercial value, thus providing area residents with an additional source of income over time.
Community awareness and support has increased due to the employment of large numbers of local community members to monitor lemurs, maintenance and preparation of seedlings in the local nurseries, as well as transplantation of trees. Furthermore, the planned distribution of incentive items as part of the conservation credit program, which is scheduled to occur in July 2012, will further strengthen community ties to forest and lemur protection efforts.
MBP Project Update Since the receipt of the grant award from the XXX Foundation, OHDZA-MBP made great strides in advancing towards the goals of the grant.
Promotion of environmental preservation: The OHDZA-MBP reforestation efforts have enhanced the promotion of habitat protection with more than 30,000 trees being planted into the landscape thus far in 2012, thereby establishing the foundation for vital corridors to connect forest fragments. The eight nurseries strategically located near each participating village housed seedlings prior to transplantation. Community representatives from the immediate area run these nurseries and coordinate future community planting days.
In addition, the program has led to the creation of contracts between OHDZA-MBP and each village. These contracts are designed to identify the specific location for each community-designated nursery plot, define the contributions of each partner, and clearly states that the land remains in the hands of the original owners.As the program expands its efforts into the larger community, there has been a growing interest in the reforestation of neighboring territories. In fact, OHDZA-MBP has increasingly been receiving requests from communities outside the Kianjavato area for guidance in the construction of nurseries near their village. Not wanting the community-based reforestation effort momentum to stop at the border of the Kianjavato commune, OHDZA-MBP has been working with representatives from these other communities to set the groundwork for their reforestation initiative.

Engagement of the local community: To date, there are a number of fantastic community partners routinely contributing to the planting efforts. These comprise groups that we originally anticipated would be involved, such as area residents, school children and their teachers, village elders, and local officials. This is in addition to the OHDZ-MBP Malagasy graduate students, local assistants and guides, and visiting researchers who are regularly involved with the program on a more official capacity. However, there is growing interest in participating from additional groups, including a local single women’s club, members of which are single mothers whose involvement with the project allows them to contribute to the community and earn additional income.
These women currently fill the role of weeding the nurseries and making shade structures for newly transplanted seedlings.Over the recent months it has become clear that word has gotten out about this reforestation program. Increasingly, people from communities outside Kianjavato make the several kilometer-trek on foot to the research station looking for work as day laborers. Working with OHDZA-MBP is now seen as a more reliable source of income than the job of gold mining, which poses health consequences, is environmentally destructive, and infrequently profitable.
Due to the participation of many factions within the Kianjavato community, there is a building of local appreciation for the project as well as its potential for aiding residents and the regional wildlife over the foreseeable future. This acceptance, coupled with a thirst for knowledge, is vital for any conservation effort, and we are very fortunate in this regard and must use it to the advantage of the larger conservation program.
   
Empowerment through education and community development: There are a number of new exciting advances regarding other education and community development opportunities. The project currently supports a postdoctoral researcher, who has a Ph.D. in botany and significant experience working with plants in Madagascar, to oversee the Kianjavato research program. Furthermore, in the first quarter of the year we had two international volunteers, with experience in horticulture and project management, spearhead the reforestation program.
These volunteers worked closely with the nursery managers, day laborers and community participants, teaching them new skills and techniques. The reforestation program made some of its greatest advances while these volunteers were onsite, so in order to continue this momentum, we are bringing two other international volunteers onsite in late June to further manage the reforestation effort and transfer lessons to the local community.

To make the most of the project’s growing awareness and community desire for assistance, our partner, Conservation Fusion, is planning a return visit to the communities of Kianjavato. The international NGO will lead another series of education and community development events to strengthen community interest and ability to participate in making a positive impact. Thus far, the advancements in community-relations have been made with minimal presentation of the conservation incentive items such as the rocket stoves and Tough Stuff Kits. However, in July 2012, the OHDZA-MBP is planning a distribution event, where participants in the reforestation program that have earned sufficient conservation credits will be awarded with a Tough Stuff Kit. \
This allocation will coincide with an education and outreach event which will highlight the advantages and ease of use of the Tough Stuff items. Although there is growing interest regarding our reforestation program, we hope that the educational activities and conservation credit program will assist us in gathering more support from the community to make the one million-tree effort feasible.
Grant-specific Update.  With the grant award from the XXX Foundation for $6,000, we amended the original design and quantity of Tough Stuff Kits that would be made available. The funds enabled us to purchase sufficient components to offer 300 Tough Stuff Kits as incentive items, each with a solar panel and battery power pack (see Table 1). In addition, the grant funds made it possible to purchase 150 LED lamps, a highly sought-after option during the initial pilot kit introduction. The solar panels, battery power packs and LED lamps were purchased in February 2012 and are currently being held at the MBP Headquarters in Antananarivo.

The premier conservation credit program award festivity is currently scheduled in July 2012, when the OHDZA-MBP general director will be onsite to coordinate the event. Through the education and outreach event to be led by Conservation Fusion, we will discuss the advantages associated with additional components for the Tough Stuff Kits. The cell phone and radio connectors will be purchased by OHDZA-MBP in the near future, once participants decide which component they would like to purchase with their conservation credit. 
 Conclusion.  While there is no straight-forward solution to poverty, this innovative forest corridor program can be one facet in a larger overarching vision. OHDZA-MBP’s one-million-tree effort, and its related conservation credit program, is a model for serving the needs of Madagascar’s people and wildlife, like the critically endangered Black and white ruffed and Greater bamboo lemurs. Encouraging communities to sustain themselves by conserving their resources rather than exploiting them will be a long-term process, but is the most effective way of steering Madagascar onto a healthier, more prosperous course.

<h3>Come with us and touch the earth, capture the scent of her fresh dark soil and the fragrance of her precious life.</h3>
<h3>She will comfort your spirit with her soft gentle song.</h3>
<h3>Come with us...Grandma and I will share our story with you..</h3>
<h2>What The Book is About:</h2>
<p>Although the title of this book is a powerful message, it contains a collection of short stories which are softened by morals, ethics and values. A young Indian girl shares her views on the love and concern she has for her homeland an tribal life.</p>
<p>These stories are based on the true Blackfeet culture, creation story, ancient spiritual values and social life. Fracking is only lightly touched on at the end of each story.</p>
<p>Lets face it, fracking is not a pretty subject so I felt it was important to add colorful illistrations to each story. A local Blackfeet artist is working on some beautiful illistrations for each page. These drawings portray an original way of native life and will draw the readers attention to what the story is about.</p>
<p>This book is designed to attact the attention of 6th graders up to adult.</p>
<h2>Why is this Important:</h2>
<p>The Blackfeet Nation sits on one of the most beautiful places on Mother Earth. From wide open praries, rolling hills and snow capped mountains, our tribe has called this place home for many thousands of years. Our entire being as a tribe is emmersed in the values of the waters, air and soil and all life upon Earth. This story is told by a young girl, there is no one better to get the point across than through the eyes of a child.</p>
<p>The Blackfeet Nation sits at the base of the Rocky Mountain front, which is the headwaters for major waterways that serve several towns, cities, including Canada. Life for thousands of miles around depend on these pure nutrient rich waters for survival.</p>
<p>I feel the stories and illistrations in this book are vital information in making a significant statement to our own Blackfeet people. They will educate our people on the dangers of fracking. Therefore they will be more inclined to inform the tribal council who can determine whether there should be a moritorium or ban put on the hydraulic fracturing (fracking).</p>
<p>Fracking came up on us so fast that no one knew what it was and most people still don't. Through my efforts I am trying to bring awareness and try to ban fracking.</p>
<h2>What have I done:</h2>
<p>I have sit up meetings and shared brochures and articles on the fracking process. I hung anti-fracking banners all over in our community. In August of this year I created a 80 mile 6 day walk, (Chief Mountain Water Walk) along the mountain front to pray, sing our water song and give offerings of sacred tobacco to each water way we came to. Nearly 14 others joined me.</p>
<p>This walk drew attention from the New York times to the Seattle Post and media around the world, however my focus was to try and bring attention to my own community and tribe. So far I have provided all of the funds to take a stand against fracking and today I cannot move forward without asking for help in financing this book. I continue to search for ways to stop the loss of our beautiful homeland and this book is my next step.</p>
<h2>Why Do I Care:</h2>
<p>I care about the life of future generations and the drinking water of grandchildren that I may never meet. I care about the this priceless piece of land that is so important to the Creation Story of our people. I care deeply for aspects of a ancient culture that may be lost in the midst of moneary ideas and greed.</p>
<p>I believe this will be a good way to bring attention to the fracking as well as an avenue for spiritual healing. We need it after all of the heartbreak and stress this venture endures.</p>
<h2>My Drive</h2>
<p>I am excited about this book it has been very healing for me to write and I thank you for being a part of my story.I have decided to publish this book through self-publishing, (Outskirts Press) because time is of the essence.Today the fracking is quickly invading our piece of the Earth.</p>
<p>My plan is that with funding help I can have this book ready to publish by March 1st, 2013. The amount of money I am asking for is $8,000 in order to make it a unique book that will also be an inovative way in bringing awareness to the people who have the power to ban fracking.</p>
<p>If there is any additional funding from the book, it will be used for the 2013 Chief Mountain Water Walk. We are all in this together, so everyone world wide is invited to join us on our spiritual walk to honor, bless and protect all waters.</p>

<h2><strong>THE ADVENTURE: A COMMITMENT TO THE EARTH</strong></h2>
<p>What happens when you shift from living a life of fast cars and roaring crowds to that of an Earth Pilgrim? For renowned South African racecar driver Geoff Dalglish, it's a personal calling to leave only footprints as he walks the world raising awareness and support for wild nature. Geoff believes that “if you see life as a miraculous journey, it will take you to amazing places,” and he is leading by example. In Geoff’s words, “This journey is about both nature and spirit, because I believe they are inseparable…and vital for our future on Planet Earth.”</p>
<p>His goal is to ultimately walk 15,500 miles (25,000 km), the equivalent of the Earth’s circumference, through a series of adventures across the planet.</p>
<p>On the Trail to Salamanca, Geoff will hike 1,500 mi, crossing six countries and four major mountain ranges to document and draw attention to the opportunities presented by the remarkable return across Europe of wilderness, wildlife, and ecological corridors!</p>
<p>Geoff embarked on his trek June 2, 2013, in Geneva, Switzerland, and will end at the 10th World Wilderness Congress (<a href=""http://www.wild10.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WILD10</a>) in Salamanca, Spain, this October. </p>
<p>He ""walks in faith"" as he knows it's the right thing to do and people of his like mind and heart will support this journey for the good of earth and all its life. He needs your help to complete this epic adventure.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></h3>
<p>We must raise $24,500 to complete his journey, and one thing you can do - quite literally - is buy miles for Geoff.</p>
<p>Twenty-five dollars will cover 1.5 miles (2.5 km). Along the way, Geoff will send back stories and images of Europe’s re-wilding. For each level of giving, you receive varying forms of thanks and gifts, such as a signed copy of Geoff’s book, ""Lost and Found: From Racecar Driver to Earth Pilgrim, from Soweto to Findhorn.""</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>DONATE &amp; CREATE A SOCIAL MOVEMENT</strong></h3>
<p>Make some noise. Giving can also take the form of sharing our campaign with as many of your friends and family as possible. With Indiegogo's easy sharing tools, it takes two seconds and brings a little extra good news to the people you care about.</p>
<p>The total expense is an estimate to cover 5 months of the Trail to Salamanca - international airfare to and from South Africa (economy) for Geoff; equipment; GPS and telephone accounts; 5 months living expenses on the walk and then in Salamanca.

<h3>The Problem:</h3>
<p>Marine debris has been around for a long time. And studies have suggested that the problem is only getting worse as we use more and more plastics each year. This debris is coming onto the beaches and killing wildlife at an increasing rate. In the Pacific, the plastics that find their way into the ocean from coastal nations and the shipping and fishing industries get into the gyre often referred to as the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"". It is estimated that approximately 15-20 tons are being dumped on the beaches of the island of Hawaii each year.  And experts suggest that the extra debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami will only add to the problem.</p>
<h3>What's Being Done Now:</h3>
<p><em><img alt=""HWF volunteers and staff haul in a tangled mess of marine debris"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://wildhawaii.org/images/jconey_melissa_nancy.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: right;""/></em> Most of the beach clean-up by HWF  is being done manually.  Currently all large netting debris is being retrieved by a 4 ton  winch on a truck. All of the smaller net fragments and other debris (bottles, toys, tires, PVC pipe, bottle caps, toothbrushes, etc., etc., ) is gathered by hand, bagged, and loaded into trucks. It is a very difficult and tedious task which involves a lot of effort. See video to watch one net being removed from the beach.</p>
<p>With the funds that are collected, we can purchase additional equipment for the HWF that will make the process much more efficient and effective.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Goal:</h3>
<p>We are raising money for the purchase of heavy-machinery to be donated to the Hawaii Wildlife Fund to help them and all their volunteers in their relentless task of removing marine debris from Hawaii's beautiful beaches.</p>
<p>If the goal of raising enough money to purchase all of this equipment (either new or used) is not reached within 4 months, the entirety of the funds collected will be donated to the Hawaii Wildlife Fund, to be used in their continuing efforts to restore the natural beauty of Hawaii's beaches.</p>

The machinery will help with the retrieving and loading of the larger marine debris (mainly nets) that are too large to handle by hand.

<p>Along with this there as an attachment called a stone fork which looks like a very large pitchfork.

<p><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""> </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Landmark Foundation was founded in 2004 in an effort to combat the loss of biodiversity. The NGO has established a leopard and predator rescue, rehabilitation, release and research program: The Leopard and Predator Project. This project spans approximately 4,5 million hectares between the Western and Eastern Cape of South Africa and is now expanding into the Northern regions of the country.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">To date we have been privileged to save 41 leopards from certain death, but have also lost 43 leopards in that time. These deaths were caused by either gin-traps, from poisons or hunting. Our interactions with these leopards, both successes and failures, have given an opportunity to collect data including genetic samples. Of those we have been able to rescue, 24 have been collared with GPS devices, making the research project one of the largest research studies on leopard in the world.</span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Less than 20% of South Africa’s landscape is protected (by the state or privately) and our efforts are not limited to these fragments. We focus on establishing regional scale connectivity of leopard and other indigenous migratory wildlife populations across the country by working with private landowners. Private landowners make up 80% of South Africa’s land containing much of the country’s biodiversity. Here we can ensure that the leopard, along with other species, has enough habitat available to ensure their survival for future generations. Our research indicates that leopards in the Cape are in dire need of conservation action. In fact their regional survival is perilously dependent on these conservation efforts as their local populations have become isolated to small population groupings in protected areas. This has resulted in the local populations being genetically isolated from regionally similar groupings and facing a genetic abyss through this bottleneck. Conservation action thus HAS to focus on establishing and maintaining genetic corridors or mechanisms to ensure the species survival. The threat to leopards has effectively created artificially </span></span><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">isolated </span></span><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">populations. Conservation thus has to re-establish genetic linkages if the species is to survive regionally. This ambition underpins all our activities.<br/><br/>We have a strong advocacy campaign against indiscriminate lethal controls such as gin-traps which often catch all species from small antelope and porcupine to jackal and leopard, as they are unselective devices, never mind barbarically cruel. Much of our efforts are spent on informing and providing farmers with ecologically acceptable and ethical means of reducing conflict between humans and predators. This has included the use of livestock guardian dogs, alpacas, various livestock protection collars, breed selection and management strategies which all protect livestock from predators. These practices replace indiscriminant controls such as gin-traps, poisons and hunting dog packs commonly used to eradicate predators on farmlands. With lethal controls removed from these farms, they become potential corridors between protected areas for species that are not contained by fences, and in so doing link populations genetically. By using these ecologically and ethically acceptable measures, biodiversity is not threatened. Furthermore, production studies have indicated dramatic successes in improved livestock production when using such management practices.<br/><br/>Landmark Foundation has expanded habitats for predators through the establishment of private nature reserves, working with cooperative landowners and participating farmers. In essence we promote a change from predator control to livestock protection, which has proven to be better for biodiversity and more profitable.<br/><br/></span></span><strong><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Our main objectives are:</span></span></strong></p>

Landmark Foundation Leopard and Predator Project
 
Landmark Foundation was founded in 2004 in an effort to combat the loss of biodiversity. The NGO has established a leopard and predator rescue, rehabilitation, release and research program: The Leopard and Predator Project. This project spans approximately 4,5 million hectares between the Western and Eastern Cape of South Africa and is now expanding into the Northern regions of the country.
To date we have been privileged to save 41 leopards from certain death, but have also lost 43 leopards in that time. These deaths were caused by either gin-traps, from poisons or hunting. Our interactions with these leopards, both successes and failures, have given an opportunity to collect data including genetic samples. Of those we have been able to rescue, 24 have been collared with GPS devices, making the research project one of the largest research studies on leopard in the world.
Less than 20% of South Africa’s landscape is protected (by the state or privately) and our efforts are not limited to these fragments. We focus on establishing regional scale connectivity of leopard and other indigenous migratory wildlife populations across the country by working with private landowners. Private landowners make up 80% of South Africa’s land containing much of the country’s biodiversity. Here we can ensure that the leopard, along with other species, has enough habitat available to ensure their survival for future generations. Our research indicates that leopards in the Cape are in dire need of conservation action. In fact their regional survival is perilously dependent on these conservation efforts as their local populations have become isolated to small population groupings in protected areas. This has resulted in the local populations being genetically isolated from regionally similar groupings and facing a genetic abyss through this bottleneck. Conservation action thus HAS to focus on establishing and maintaining genetic corridors or mechanisms to ensure the species survival. The threat to leopards has effectively created artificially isolated populations. Conservation thus has to re-establish genetic linkages if the species is to survive regionally. This ambition underpins all our activities.We have a strong advocacy campaign against indiscriminate lethal controls such as gin-traps which often catch all species from small antelope and porcupine to jackal and leopard, as they are unselective devices, never mind barbarically cruel. Much of our efforts are spent on informing and providing farmers with ecologically acceptable and ethical means of reducing conflict between humans and predators. This has included the use of livestock guardian dogs, alpacas, various livestock protection collars, breed selection and management strategies which all protect livestock from predators. These practices replace indiscriminant controls such as gin-traps, poisons and hunting dog packs commonly used to eradicate predators on farmlands. With lethal controls removed from these farms, they become potential corridors between protected areas for species that are not contained by fences, and in so doing link populations genetically. By using these ecologically and ethically acceptable measures, biodiversity is not threatened. Furthermore, production studies have indicated dramatic successes in improved livestock production when using such management practices.Landmark Foundation has expanded habitats for predators through the establishment of private nature reserves, working with cooperative landowners and participating farmers. In essence we promote a change from predator control to livestock protection, which has proven to be better for biodiversity and more profitable.Our main objectives are:


Rescue, rehabilitation and release of injured or captured species, with a particular focus on leopards;


Advocacy to ban gin-traps, hunting dogs and poison traps;


Research into leopard ecology and management at landscape level;


Instituting ethical and ecologically acceptable management methodologies on participating farms;


Developing a green brand (Fair Game) and consumer awareness for the public to make a difference;


Education of scholars and the general public regarding predators, often using arts and culture that promotes our natural heritage; and


Increasing suitable landscape / habitat for predators and biodiversity outside of protected areas.


 
What We Need & What You Get
With this campaign, Landmark Foundation's Leopard and Predator Project is looking to receive approximately $100 000.
Where does the money go? Landmark Foundation is built on trust, transparency and effective action on the ground. The figures below are working costs involved in the running of the project. Funds received are allocated where they are needed most, unless a sponsor would like to donate to something specific.


Livestock Protection Collar - Dead Stop


Basic educational resource pack per school (250 pupils -posters & activity sheets)


E-Shepherd alarm collar per sheep


Survey field cameras (with batteries and card for one year)


New tyres for field work vehicle


A livestock guardian dog (with food and veterinary care for the 1st year of life)


A pair of alpacas


GPS collar for leopard (on average we rescue 7 leopards each year)


Fuel necessary to travel to the different locations where predators are being targeted


As we have chosen the flexible funding strategy, any and all funds received will go directly to funding the projects no matter if we reach our goal or not.
 
Perks!
$5- Landmark Foundation sticker
$25- Landmark Foundation cap
$100- Landmark Foundation Shirt and cap
$150- 'Dead Stop' collars placed on 35 sheep or goats. 'Dead Stop' collars are manufactured using a broad metal mesh, which is epoxy-coated.

$1000- Guarding dog, alpaca, or donkey. Shepard dogs are trained as puppies, they bond and live exclusively with their flock. Each of these guarding animals will confront and scare off predators, eliminating the need for lethal control methods.
$10,000- Skydiving Event. If the campaign receives $10 000, each of the Landmark Foundation team will skydive.
 
Why Predators?
Predators play an essential role in the ecosystem, keeping them healthy and balanced. The leopard is the last remaining apex predator in the Western and Eastern Cape.


It is an umbrella species and requires large areas of habitat and by conserving them many other animals are automatically conserved.


Less than 20% of South African landscapes are formally protected, this is not enough to ensure any species’ existence therefore conservation on private land is also needed.


Traditional predator control has had a significantly detrimental impact on biodiversity. The Cape fox and Riverine rabbit are rare and vulnerable to extinction. Lethal controls continue to impact on their populations.


Farmers are still battling with livestock losses even though predators have been gin-trapped, poisoned, hunted and killed for centuries in an effort to reduce their livestock losses. The problem of livestock losses is reportedly worse now than ever before, indicating these methods are ineffective.


The Cape lion became extinct in 1858 and the brown hyena and cheetah disappeared from most of the area in the 1900s. Due to their elusive nature and adaptability, leopard still fight for survival today. They have managed to remain in inhospitable and mountainous regions.

</h3><p> </p></div>","L’alta via più lunga del mondo: un sentiero sconosciuto di 6.880 km che attraversa tutte le montagne d'Italia. Una spedizione di un anno per rilanciare le terre alte. Tre ragazzi e un team inclusivo, di cui anche tu puoi far parte, per raccontare la vita tra le montagne italiane: un viaggio collettivo che inizia ora, grazie al tuo contributo. L’ALTA VIA PIÙ LUNGA DEL MONDO ​  In Italia esiste un sentiero che attraversa tutte le catene montuose e abbraccia l’intero stivale, cavalcandone ininterrottamente la spina dorsale: dall’enrosadira delle Dolomiti ai crateri dell’Etna, dagli stambecchi del Gran Paradiso ai secolari pini loricati del Pollino... Tocca tutte le regioni e passa per centinaia di piccoli borghi montani, incontaminati, spesso sconosciuti, scrigni di antichi usi e costumi. Leggende, dialetti, ricette… un mosaico di infinite particolarità che rendono unico il Bel Paese.Tutto questo è il Sentiero Italia.Con i suoi 6.880 km, le sue 368 tappe e un dislivello positivo di 350.000 m, il Sentiero Italia è l’alta via più lunga del mondo... nel paese più bello del mondo!E’ un autentico tesoro, un patrimonio mondiale. Ne hai mai sentito parlare? Ideato dall'Associazione Sentiero Italia nel 1983 e realizzato grazie all'intervento del Club Alpino Italiano, il Sentiero è stato a lungo dimenticato, come molte delle terre che esso attraversa.Ma oggi il Sentiero è tornato alla luce: nel 2018 infatti il Club Alpino Italiano ha annunciato la sua riapertura! Negli ultimi mesi, centinaia di volontari CAI hanno lavorato duramente all’opera di restauro del percorso, che verrà ultimato entro questa primavera......e noi si parte!  LA NOSTRA MISSION Siamo Yuri, Sara e Giacomo, tre ragazzi innamorati delle montagne, compagni di vita e di tante avventure. Amiamo il nostro paese e vogliamo meritarci le meraviglie che ci circondano, impegnandoci in prima persona a fare qualcosa di concreto.Scoperta l’esistenza del Sentiero Italia, nel 2017, è nato in noi il desiderio intimo e personale di percorrerlo. Abbiamo subito compreso che questo viaggio sarebbe dovuto diventare un’esperienza coinvolgente, collettiva, aperta a tutti: un’occasione unica per fare qualcosa di concreto per le nostre montagne.Il nostro obiettivo è contribuire a rilanciare il Sentiero Italia: vogliamo farlo conoscere in tutto il mondo e così facendo dare voce alle terre alte, luoghi meravigliosi ma spesso dimenticati, che da decenni subiscono il fenomeno dello spopolamento.In che modo? Percorrendo a piedi tutto il Sentiero Italia insieme a chiunque vorrà unirsi alla nostra spedizione, raccontando in diretta questa avventura e raccogliendo la nostra esperienza in un portale web che sarà una finestra sulle terre alte italiane, multilingua e sempre a portata di smartphone. Per riuscirci però abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto: dona ora e cammina con noi!Il nostro sogno è che questo progetto sia il seme per una svolta positiva per le montagne italiane.“Non aspettarti nessuna risposta oltre la tua” - B. Brecht   COSA FAREMO  2019, Anno Nazionale del Turismo Lento.Il viaggio avrà inizio a maggio. In cammino per oltre un anno, scopriremo di persona le 368 tappe del Sentiero Italia, da Nord a Sud, nell'unica maniera sostenibile: camminando.Un viaggio lento e intenso: 6880 km di incontri e scoperte, attraverso i mille volti del nostro paese. Un’avventura unica, irripetibile, una scoperta di cui anche tu puoi far parte: potrai camminare insieme a noi, diventando voce narrante del Sentiero Italia!Grazie ai social, giorno dopo giorno racconteremo la nostra esperienza e i luoghi attraversati: i paesaggi, le genti, i dialetti, i cibi, le tradizioni, i mestieri vecchi e nuovi… quanto basta a ingolosire i viaggiatori di tutto il mondo!Durante la marcia documenteremo le unicità delle terre alte attraversate dal Sentiero Italia e inseriremo queste “pillole” su una piattaforma web realizzata ad hoc, a disposizione di tutti. Condivideremo inoltre le nostre tracce gps, complete delle info utili per affrontare il cammino (punti di accoglienza, luoghi di interesse, punti d’acqua, criticità…).Daremo vita alla prima spedizione collettiva condivisa in tempo reale.Esploratori di tutto il mondo, uniamoci!   PERCHÉ IL TUO CONTRIBUTO CONTA Ora servono i fondi per trasformare questo sogno in realtà: la spedizione è tanto ambiziosa quanto… costosa!Da buoni camminatori, facciamo un passo alla volta. E i primi passi li vogliamo fare proprio qui, con te. Il crowdfunding per noi è un modo del tutto naturale e coerente di far crescere Va’ Sentiero: un progetto che nasce dal basso, per valorizzare insieme un tesoro che appartiene a tutti noi.Grazie al tenace lavoro degli ultimi due anni, abbiamo trovato gli sponsor (Montura, Ferrino e Ziel) che ci hanno fornito del materiale tecnico: zaini, abbigliamento, scarpe, tende, sacchi a pelo, binocoli…Abbiamo consolidato importanti partnership: dal Touring Club Italiano a Radio Francigena, le Scuole ... Abbiamo ottenuto tantissimi patrocini: il Ministero dell’Ambiente, oltre 10 Regioni italiane e tante associazioni nazionali...Grazie a questa fitta rete, abbiamo creato un’incredibile cassa di risonanza per il progetto.Solo con il tuo aiuto potremo iniziare quest'avventura!  PERCHE' VA' SENTIERO E' UN PROGETTO SPECIALE?    COME UTILIZZEREMO I FONDI RACCOLTI   1. LA SPEDIZIONECon i primi 20.000 euro, copriremo i costi vivi del viaggio: le spese di vitto e alloggio dei primi 7 mesi di viaggio, per noi e per il team di supporto (responsabile logistica, comunicazione, driver). Inoltre ci procureremo le tecnologie di base a produrre i contenuti multimediali per raccontare i luoghi attraversati: attrezzatura fotografica, hard disk, un drone e dispositivi gps.Daremo vita alla prima spedizione collettiva raccontata in tempo reale! 2. IL LIBRO: VOLTI DEL SENTIERO ITALIAA viaggio concluso raccoglieremo in un libro i paesaggi del Sentiero Italia e i ritratti delle centinaia di persone che incontreremo e quelle che si uniranno a questa pazza spedizione, condividendo con noi la fatica e il sudore, ma anche la gioia e la passione: gli ambasciatori di Va’ Sentiero. Tra quelle pagine ci sarai anche tu!La produzione del libro costerà circa 5.000 euro. Le fotografie saranno realizzate da Sara, la fotografa ufficiale di Va’ Sentiero e il volume sarà auto-prodotto. Sarà possibile acquistarlo online, ma intanto puoi essere tra i primi ad aggiudicarselo scegliendolo come ricompensa alla tua donazione! 3. I REPORTAGE VIDEO Durante la spedizione, vogliamo coinvolgere giovani professionisti del campo audio-visivo, per documentare questa irripetibile esperienza e produrre video di qualità che saranno condivisi sui social e sul sito.  Vogliamo presentare nel migliore dei modi le mille meraviglie custodite tra le montagne, dai paesaggi naturali a quelli umani: sarebbe un peccato usare solo gli smartphones!Abbiamo già iniziato a creare una rete di giovani videomakers talentuosi e determinati a unirsi a quest'avventura, a rotazione: con ulteriori  15.000 euro possiamo coprire le spese vive di un piccolo team audio-visivo per la prima tranche della spedizione! 4. IL FURGONE Se raccoglieremo altri 15.000 euro, prepareremo un furgone che ci seguirà a fondovalle:sarà la nostra stazione di editing on the road, per elaborare e diffondere i contenuti multimediali.  Inoltre fungerà da supporto logistico, per trasportare attrezzatura di emergenza e permetterci di viaggiare più leggeri.Grazie al tuo aiuto attrezzeremo il furgone con tutto il necessario (dalle postazioni di lavoro ai pannelli fotovoltaici sul tetto) e ne copriremo le spese di viaggio e manutenzione. 5. IL SITOSe raccoglieremo altri 5.000 euro, creeremo una piattaforma web trasversale, implementata grazie al lavoro di ricerca svolto lungo il cammino: una finestra aperta sul nostro paese-montagna.Sarà uno strumento interattivo, multilingua, mobile friendly. Al suo interno, troverai ii contenuti multimediali (foto e video) e gli approfondimenti sulle unicità locali: la biodiversità, le ricette, i dialetti, la musica, le feste, i borghi…Caricheremo sul sito le nostre tracce gps (complete di info quali criticità, strutture ricettive, punti d'acqua), scaricabili gratuitamente. Infine, grazie alla condivisione della nostra posizione reale in homepage, potrai seguire gli sviluppi del nostro viaggio e sapere dove unirti alla spedizione,. CAMMINARE CON NOI: COSA SIGNIFICA Le singole tappe della spedizione e le rispettive tempistiche verranno pubblicate sui nostri canali social e sul nostro sito, con cadenza mensile.Diventando nostro sostenitore, avrai in anteprima le tappe e le tempistiche: potrete scegliere la vostra tappa preferita e diventare parte della squadra di camminatori che ci accompagnerà in quel tratto.Essere parte di una spedizione significa giocare in una squadra in cui ognuno ha un ruolo da svolgere, con responsabilità, per il successo dell’impresa. Ci sarà la squadra sherpa, che si occuperà della logistica; o quella dei topografi, addetti alla raccolta delle info tecniche; o ancora, quella dei reporters, che documenteranno i momenti e i luoghi…E tu, di quale squadra vorrai far parte?    S.I. WE CAN Sono le opportunità a entusiasmarci! Esse riguardo un valore trascurato, che può dare un contributo importante alle montagne e alle loro comunità.Siamo consapevoli si tratti di un progetto impegnativo. La montagna stessa, d'altronde, è una strada in salita, ma siamo sicuri che, se camminerai insieme a noi, riusciremo ad arrivare in cima.Del resto Walter Bonatti, cui questo progetto è dedicato, disse che “chi più in alto sale, più lontano vede”.E noi proprio là puntiamo, in alto.  Ci vediamo sul Sentiero& seguici sui social!

Three friends and an inclusive team, which you can join, to tell about life in the Italian alpine communities. A collective journey that starts now, thanks to your contribution.    THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN TRAIL IN THE WORLD In Italy there is a hiking trail that runs uninterruptedly across all the mountain ranges and ridges from North to South: from the Dolomites to Etna's craters, from the vertigos of the Matterhorn to the ancient pine trees of the Pollino. It touches all the regions and goes through hundreds of tiny alpine hamlets, often unknown, pristine, treasuring ancient traditions, legends, dialects, recipes...a mosaic  of endless peculiarities that make our country unique.All this is the Sentiero Italia.With its 6.880 km, its 368 stages and a total climb of 350.000 m +, the Sentiero Italia is the highest mountain trail in the world...in the most beautiful country in the world!It is a real treasure, a world heritage, unfortunately still little known.Created by the Associazione Sentiero Italia in 1983 and built thanks to the Club Alpino Italiano (CAI), the S.I. has been long forgotten: just like many of the lands it runs through.But today the Sentiero is ready to be revamped: in 2018 the Club Alpino Italiano has announced its re-opening! Hundreds of volunteers are working to restore the path which will be completed this spring.....and we go!  OUR MISSION We are Yuri, Sara and Giacomo, three friends passionate about the mountains, sharing life and its many adventures.

We'll hike the Sentiero Italia in its entirety, together with all those who will want to join the expedition.

We believe that there are no borders in the fight to end the dog meat trade. We have chosen to focus on fighting to end the dog meat trade in China because that’s where the greatest number of dogs in the world  are being brutalized. Every year about 20 million dogs are brutally slaughtered in China. It is a 365-days-a-year fight.</p><p>Soon our fight will take on more urgency with the annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival right around the corner. Every June, 10,000-15,000 dogs are butchered, eaten, and skinned to make fur trims. We will be on high alert at this time in order to rescue more dogs. The shocking thing is that the majority of these dogs being tortured and eaten were once someone’s house pet and were stolen from their homes or sold to the butchers by their owners.</p><p>Currently we have 180 dogs in our shelter in Beijing - all rescued from dog meat trucks and slaughterhouses. But we need to make room for more of the dogs that will be rescued from Yulin.</p><p>Our current goal is to bring 10 dogs safely back to a forever loving home. In order to bring home 10 dogs, we will need to raise $15,000. This will cover the cost of their care, and of flying and transporting the dogs from China to the U.S.  If we can raise even more, we can bring back more dogs.  But these 10 are the most urgent.</p><p>Watch this video to learn more about the work that  <a href=""http://www.nodogsleftbehind.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>No Dogs Left Behind</strong></a> <strong>(NDLB)</strong> does:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ddao2uULA8Y?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p><strong>How Do The Chinese Feel About Eating Dogs?</strong></p><p>Although the Yulin Dog Meat Festival began in 2009, the custom of eating dogs can be traced back to approximately 400 years ago.  There is <a href=""https://www.worlddogalliance.org/china-how-it-was-a-political-perversion-not-culture-that-led-to-the-dog-meat-trade-as-we-know-it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a great article by the World Dog Alliance</a> that goes into more detail about the Chinese culture and the history, both political and cultural, of eating dogs. Attitudes about dogs are changing in China amongst the middle class and there are now over 62 million registered pets in China.  Animal activists and pet lovers have begun to speak up and take more action against the brutal treatment of these animals.</p><p> </p><p><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p><p>Back in 2016, Jeffrey Beri, had just come off a historic rescue mission in China.  He and other activists were successfully treating, rehabilitating and transporting 121 dogs from Yulin with funding provided by the Soi Dog Foundation. They had transport sponsorship for 11 dogs provided by the American Humane Society.  It took Jeff and his team months upon months of constant treatment and rehabilitation for these dogs to get well and learn to love.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556704484/ijwq4geigq0vqvz3bkio.png"" src=""""/></p><p>After the 2016 rescue, Jeffrey went back to China and continued working with activists.  He brought 50 more dog meat trade dogs to safety that were in desperate need of help. </p><p> </p><p><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.nodogsleftbehind.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">No Dogs Left Behind</a> (NDLB) </strong>has two missions of equal importance: end the dog meat trade completely and permanently; and, until we accomplish that goal, rescue as many dogs as possible, rehabilitating them and finding them forever homes.</p><p>Our entire organization operates on the <strong>Five Pillars of Rescue</strong> which Jeff Beri developed:</p><p><strong>Emergency Response</strong> – brave activists track and then intercept dog meat trucks and stop the drivers from taking the dogs to the slaughterhouse.  No Dogs Left Behind and its team members provides emergency medical treatment to the dogs, all of whom are sick, beaten or starving (or all three).</p><p><strong>Shelter Operations Protocol</strong> – Once the dogs are stabilized, they are brought back to our shelter to continue medical treatment, be vaccinated and spayed/neutered, and rehabilitated emotionally and psychologically.</p><p><strong>Adoption</strong> – Our goal is to have our dogs adopted into loving homes. The adoption process is costly.  It is expensive to pay for the dogs’ transport and we must find a “flight hero” willing to travel to Beijing and return to the U.S. or Canada with the dogs.</p><p><strong>Education</strong>– Educating the youth in China is a huge part of our operation. Teaching children to love and respect animals is what will ultimately bring an end to the brutal treatment of these dogs.</p><p><strong>Government Advocacy</strong> – Quite possibly the most important step is getting the sale and consumption of dog meat outlawed. As impossible as this may seem, increasing numbers of Chinese support ending the dog meat trade.  While pressure from outside of China is important, we can only achieve our goal with the support of the Chinese people themselves.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556703361/iesle5lrwgqpozo6upyb.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p><p>Despite being bitten more times than he can count, Jeff works patiently and tirelessly with the dogs at our shelter while they recover and learn to trust humans again.

Now, the newly-rescued dogs in the care of No Dogs Left Behind are in need of vaccinations, medicine, treatment, and lots of tender loving care for the wounds and abuse that they have endured.  HELP US to rehabilitate these Yulin Survivors so that they can go on to have happy, healthy lives in new forever loving homes. When our dogs walk the streets of the U.S. or Canada, they send a message to everyone who sees them.  They are the proud survivors and ambassadors of the work that No Dogs Left Behind (NDLB) does. OUR NEW STRETCH GOAL Is To Raise $10,000 To Care For Our New Rescues!Your contributions will cover the cost of emergency response, vaccinations, flea and tick medication and crucial medical treatment and continued care of our Yulin Survivors.  No Dogs Left Behind is a non-governmental, non-profit organization and we rely solely on the donations of people such as yourself.  We couldn’t do our work without the kindness and generosity of caring people all over the world who support our cause.THANK YOU for supporting the work of No Dogs Left Behind! JUNE 30, 2019 UPDATEToday is the last day of the dreaded Yulin Dog Meat Festival. We need to make room in our Beijing shelter for the dogs we have rescued from Yulin.  They desperately need vaccinations, medicine, treatment for wounds and much, much love. We are so grateful for ALL the support that we have received so far and continue to receive. We have raised $25,123 to date! Many of the dogs featured on this campaign will soon be making their flights to freedom. Stay tuned for more updates!  JUNE 21 , 2019 UPDATEWe are so OVERWHELMED and GRATEFUL for ALL the support we've gotten!Now that we have raised $15,000, we can bring the 10 dog meat survivors featured on this campaign safely to loving homes. But let's not stop here.  HELP Us to raise MORE to bring home MORE Dog Meat SurvivorsWe're adding 3 more dogs to this campaign. Meet Yulin Dog Meat Survivors: Dude, Panda and Petunia. All 3 were rescued from a 6.19.17 dog meat truck headed for the Yulin Dog Meat Festival and you can help us get them safely to forever loving homes!DudePandaPetunia We started this campaign to raise $15,000 to bring home 10 dogs, Some have asked why only 10 dogs. If you take a look at the adoption and transportation fees listed on our website you'll see why.We wanted to start by raising enough money for 10 dogs first. If we raise more money we can bring EVEN MORE dogs home.  Let's keep it going! OVERVIEWNo Dogs Left Behind (NDLB) is an organization dedicated to ending the dog meat trade by shutting down slaughterhouses, exposing the butchers, educating the general public about the humane treatment of dogs and working with government officials throughout the world to put laws into place to stop the brutal and barbaric treatment of dogs by humans.Much of the dog meat trade takes place in countries in Asia. We believe that there are no borders in the fight to end the dog meat trade. We have chosen to focus on fighting to end the dog meat trade in China because that’s where the greatest number of dogs in the world  are being brutalized. Every year about 20 million dogs are brutally slaughtered in China. It is a 365-days-a-year fight.Soon our fight will take on more urgency with the annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival right around the corner. Every June, 10,000-15,000 dogs are butchered, eaten, and skinned to make fur trims. We will be on high alert at this time in order to rescue more dogs. The shocking thing is that the majority of these dogs being tortured and eaten were once someone’s house pet and were stolen from their homes or sold to the butchers by their owners.Currently we have 180 dogs in our shelter in Beijing - all rescued from dog meat trucks and slaughterhouses. But we need to make room for more of the dogs that will be rescued from Yulin.Our current goal is to bring 10 dogs safely back to a forever loving home. In order to bring home 10 dogs, we will need to raise $15,000. This will cover the cost of their care, and of flying and transporting the dogs from China to the U.S.  If we can raise even more, we can bring back more dogs.  But these 10 are the most urgent.Watch this video to learn more about the work that  No Dogs Left Behind (NDLB) does: How Do The Chinese Feel About Eating Dogs?Although the Yulin Dog Meat Festival began in 2009, the custom of eating dogs can be traced back to approximately 400 years ago.  There is a great article by the World Dog Alliance that goes into more detail about the Chinese culture and the history, both political and cultural, of eating dogs. Attitudes about dogs are changing in China amongst the middle class and there are now over 62 million registered pets in China.  Animal activists and pet lovers have begun to speak up and take more action against the brutal treatment of these animals. OUR STORYBack in 2016, Jeffrey Beri, had just come off a historic rescue mission in China.  He and other activists were successfully treating, rehabilitating and transporting 121 dogs from Yulin with funding provided by the Soi Dog Foundation. They had transport sponsorship for 11 dogs provided by the American Humane Society.  It took Jeff and his team months upon months of constant treatment and rehabilitation for these dogs to get well and learn to love.After the 2016 rescue, Jeffrey went back to China and continued working with activists.  He brought 50 more dog meat trade dogs to safety that were in desperate need of help.  OUR MISSIONNo Dogs Left Behind (NDLB) has two missions of equal importance: end the dog meat trade completely and permanently; and, until we accomplish that goal, rescue as many dogs as possible, rehabilitating them and finding them forever homes.Our entire organization operates on the Five Pillars of Rescue which Jeff Beri developed:Emergency Response – brave activists track and then intercept dog meat trucks and stop the drivers from taking the dogs to the slaughterhouse.  No Dogs Left Behind and its team members provides emergency medical treatment to the dogs, all of whom are sick, beaten or starving (or all three).Shelter Operations Protocol – Once the dogs are stabilized, they are brought back to our shelter to continue medical treatment, be vaccinated and spayed/neutered, and rehabilitated emotionally and psychologically.Adoption – Our goal is to have our dogs adopted into loving homes. The adoption process is costly.  It is expensive to pay for the dogs’ transport and we must find a “flight hero” willing to travel to Beijing and return to the U.S. or Canada with the dogs.Education– Educating the youth in China is a huge part of our operation. Teaching children to love and respect animals is what will ultimately bring an end to the brutal treatment of these dogs.Government Advocacy – Quite possibly the most important step is getting the sale and consumption of dog meat outlawed. As impossible as this may seem, increasing numbers of Chinese support ending the dog meat trade.  While pressure from outside of China is important, we can only achieve our goal with the support of the Chinese people themselves. THE IMPACTDespite being bitten more times than he can count, Jeff works patiently and tirelessly with the dogs at our shelter while they recover and learn to trust humans again. When they are sent to their new homes, our dogs are our global ambassadors.  Their behavior in their new homes speaks louder than any words. When our dogs walk the streets of the U.S. or Canada, they send a message to everyone who sees them.  They are survivors and ambassadors of the work that No Dogs Left Behind (NDLB) does. The dogs don’t realize just how special they really are but we do. MEET THE DOGS WE ARE PLANNING TO BRING HOME TO THE U.S.ConnorMaxNanaPandaPetunia UPDATE ON: PANDA & PETUNIA Panda and Petunia are now safely in the U.S. with loving families.

She will be taking her flight to freedom soon but still needs to find a forever loving home. When she was rescued by brave activists on 6.19.17, she was cramped tightly in horrific conditions in a dog meat truck, heading for the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, where thousands of dogs are tortured, cooked and eaten each year. Her face was smashed by the butchers and her body was covered in trauma wounds. No Dogs Left Behind treated Nikki’s wounds, administered rabies and distemper vaccinations, de-wormer, and flea and tick medications. With loving care NDLG and rehabilitated Nikki. Nikki is a sweet girl. Playful and perfect for a family home.

When rescuers arrived some of the dogs had already been slaughtered. These dogs that were still alive and among the terrified witnesses to what the saw. But No Dogs Left Behind took these dogs in and treated and vaccinated them. And now they are proud slaughterhouse survivors. UPDATES: These Dogs Have Been Adopted!KellyFreddieWe Are Looking For Volunteers to Help Transport These Dogs From China to the U.S.If you’re interested in volunteering to tag a dog onto your flight back to the U.S. contact us at: (917) 767-0134 The No Dogs Left Behind TeamJeffrey Beri, FounderJeffrey Beri is the founder of No Dogs Left Behind (NDLB). Before founding NDLB, Jeffrey was a designer and manufacturer of high end jewelry. A life-long dog lover, one day Jeffrey took a trip to China to rescue dogs from the dog meat trade. What he saw affected him so much that he quit his job, sold his possessions and moved to China to devote himself to save dogs from the dog meat trade. In China, Jeffrey developed the Five Pillars of Rescue which sets the standard for rescuing and rehabilitating Dog Meat Trade survivors. He founded the No Dogs Left Behind (NDLB) Shelter in Beijing, the only Chinese shelter which engages in rescue, medical treatment, and rehabilitation of these beautiful but traumatized dogs. No Dogs Left Behind means exactly that. Every dog is treated, vetted, rehabilitated and set up for success to be adopted into forever loving homes Jeff works with activists to intercept dog meat trucks,  shut down slaughterhouses and engage in emergency evacuations of dogs. He and the shelter staff spend weeks, months, however long is necessary, to make them ready for their forever loving homes in the United States and Canada. Jeffrey is a firm believer that change in China will come from within. That is why he spends so much time at the shelter working with students of all ages, teaching them that dogs are animals to be loved and cherished, not killed and eaten.  Bonnie Klapper, Legal CounselBonnie Klapper is legal counsel and jack of all trades for No Dogs Left Behind. She has spent 33 years working in the criminal justice system as a federal prosecutor and a defense attorney.  Bonnie is a vegan and loves all animals but especially dogs. Now she works for a different form of justice - justice for the kidnapped, abused, tortured dogs of China. For Bonnie there is no higher calling than to save these dogs and work to change Chinese laws to end the meat trade. She is thankful to her parents for giving her the best legal education possible which has allowed her to devote herself to this most important cause. Here's an important message from Bonnie about the urgency surrounding the Yulin Dog Meat Festival:  Press and Media CoverageWink News Video (Feb 2018)ABC News Coverage of the 12/18/18 transport of 10 dogs to Chicago O’Hare Recognition2018 Pet Philanthropy Circle Pet Hero Awards CAN'T DONATE?

<p>A l'occasion d'une étonnante synchronicité, Nathalie fut
inspirée au mois d’août dernier de contacter Laurent afin de lui demander son pardon pour les blessures du passé et de lui témoigner à quel point cette

soucieux de proposer à leur enfant respectif une expérience hors du commun dans
sa portée humaine et éducative.Retrouvailles de deux partenaires de vie,
Laurent & Nathalie ont vécu une histoire commune de 7 ans, de 19 à 26
ans, et se sont quittés dans l’ombre de leur propre immaturité et inconscience,
sans plus aucun contact 20 ans durant.
A l'occasion d'une étonnante synchronicité, Nathalie fut
inspirée au mois d’août dernier de contacter Laurent afin de lui demander son pardon pour les blessures du passé et de lui témoigner à quel point cette
histoire avait conditionnée le reste de sa vie. A ce moment même, Laurent, en
totale perte de sens, au bord de la désespérance, bouleversé
par ce message propose une rencontre...
Une amitié se déploie alors entre ces deux êtres
apportant à chacun guérison et pacification…Ce voyage est pour chacun un acte symbolique très fort et l'opportunité d'offrir à leurs
enfants une chance unique de voir la vie « par l’autre bout de la
lorgnette ». Celui par lequel on voit une autre facette de « la vraie
vie », celle qui nous confond avec la Nature dont Nous, Êtres humains
faisons partie intégrante, ce qui nous échappe parfois (souvent ?).""Avoir la chance, l’opportunité - dans le sens le plus noble du terme - de vivre une transatlantique en famille ne se présente certainement pas plus d’une fois ou deux dans une vie. Nous avons voulu la saisir, pour permettre à nous-mêmes et à nos enfants de guérir quelque chose en nous tous d’indéfinissable mais qui indéniablement est en « creux », en « manque ».""""Ce voyage est pour moi  l'ultime deadline avant une incontournable intervention chirurgicale que je refuse depuis plus de 2 ans : La mer(e), l'acceptation de ce qui est, vivre un lien fort avec ma fille, réaliser ce projet avec Laurent...  représentent autant d'aspects porteurs de guérison. C'est comme une prière faite à l'Univers"" (Nathalie)""Voici 20 ans que je sillonne les océans, ce voyage avec mon fils Corentin, Nathalie et Luna marquera  probablement la fin de ce cycle..."" (Laurent)""...Une coque de noix au milieu des éléments qui nous dépassent, nous animent, nous nourrissent, nous rendent vivants, vibrants, joyeux, heureux…""Et même pour Laurent, marin expérimenté, l’aventure avec Corentin prend un autre goût.C’est pour tout cela que les deux familles, afin de réaliser leur objectif :- Ont mis en place un financement participatif avec de belles contreparties puisqu’il s’agit de gagner des sorties en mer dans la baie de Toulon et des îles de Porquerolles, Port Cros et Le Levant.Un avant goût pour vous faire rêver : http://www.hyeres-tourisme.com/- Ont réalisé un emprunt de 6000€ auprès de leurs proches pour anticiper vos contributions car les investissements financiers pour l'organisation du voyage ont déjà commencé._________________________________________________________________________
Laurent, marin expérimenté, est le papa de Corentin, 9
ans, qui, malgré sa gentillesse et sa joie de vivre naturelle, est en
difficulté d’intégration scolaire pour cause de précocité, catalogué comme « surdoué
».
Nathalie, intervenante en bien-être et organisatrice en événementiel,
est maman de Luna, 14 ans, aérienne, créative et pleine d’amour ; elle «
ne se sent pas concernée » par les programmes scolaires bien quelle soit
heureuse de se rendre au collège, d’être avec ses amies et d’avoir de belles
relations avec certains de ses professeurs.Il consiste à
proposer à ces 2 enfants une traversée de l’Atlantique à la voile, sur un
catamaran de 13m de long, et de les inspirer à poser un regard différent sur le
monde, loin des écrans, au cœur d’eux-mêmes. De mettre à
profit ce support pédagogique exceptionnel pour leur accomplissement, dans le
désir d’interagir avec leur milieu scolaire afin de créer une richesse à
partager.De nos jours, les
communications satellites permettent d’offrir cette aventure à toute
personne restée à terre : familles, enseignants, camarades… L'aboutissement de ce projet requiert la coopération active
et volontaire de chacun. Ce projet souhaite l’adhésion et le soutien des enseignants
pour permettre aux parents d’assurer la continuité de l’activité scolaire dans
les meilleures conditions. L’encadrement à bord intégrera l’aspect éducatif et
l’engagement de l’enfant est demandé. Les questions d’ordres légal et
administratif soulevées par l'organisation d’un tel projet seront réglées en
lien avec les structures familiales et scolaires au fur et à mesure de son
avancement.Nous espérons que nos enfants y gagneront en maturité, en confiance en eux,
qu’une alchimie particulière se mettra en place entre eux et pour eux-mêmes,
quel que soit leur profil totalement différent. Nous souhaitons ardemment que
parents et enfants vivent quelque chose d'extrêmement fort ensemble.L’ensemble des partenaires diffuseront le projet sur leur réseau en vue
d’obtenir un maximum de financement participatif sans lequel le projet aurait du mal à voir le jour. - L’Association

vous avez entre 18 et 30 ans, ce projet vous parle alors venez-nous rejoindre.
Votre dynamisme sera bienvenu et vous représentez une génération intermédiaire
qui réjouira petits et grands.                               Ce catamaran Punch 12,50 est un bateau marin et
éprouvé. Capacité huit personnes.Il est équipé grand voyage et navigue sous pavillon français depuis quelques
années avec un équipage familial où les enfants sont en majorité.Équipement de
sécurité hauturier complet aux normes françaises (radar, AIS, balise Cospas-Sarsat).Une activité scolaire quotidienne sera mise en place à
bord pour le nécessaire achèvement du programme de l’année en cours. La période
concernée couvre la fin de l'année scolaire, sa durée courte ne justifie pas le
recours aux services du CNED. Une concertation avec les équipes enseignantes des établissements où
sont scolarisés les enfants devrait permettre d’accorder objectifs et moyens
pédagogiques.La portée
éducative de cette aventure est très vaste et recouvre les thèmes de la mer, de la géographie, de
la navigation, des communications et suivi des positions, de la vie à bord, de
la pêche, de la faune, de la météo, et aussi de la gestion de l'eau, de
l'énergie et des déchets …Elle porte aussi sur :
- l’adaptation au milieu et à la vie en groupe : socialisation, partage des tâches, hygiène de vie. Contrôler son émotivité et construire une éthique personnelle et collective ;- l’action commune : organisation matérielle, travail sur la communication, acceptation de la nécessaire confiance réciproque et respect des rôles garantissant la bonne marche du navire ; favoriser la complémentarité, la cohésion et l’harmonie de l’équipage, la vie sociale, la confiance en soi ;- la prise de responsabilité : comprendre et accepter les règles, apprendre à anticiper pour décider, trouver sa place, assumer son rôle et ses actes.

La dimension éthique et solidaire à l’extérieur du bateau n’est pas
oubliée ! Les deux parents ont voulu que leurs enfants –bénéficiant de
cette chance de développement personnel, rare à leur âge- offrent en retour une action écologique tout au long du voyage y compris lors
des escales prévues.
L’attention sera donc porté sur la dépollution en ramassant tout simplement les débris et poubelles qui
malheureusement jonchent notre belle planète, tant en mer que sur terre.C'est aussi
l'occasion pour eux de rencontrer d'autres cultures, d'autres enfants, d'autres
façons de vivre lors des quatre escales prévues, de s'enrichir de cette
ouverture au monde.  
Ainsi, ils pourront mettre à profit ce support pédagogique exceptionnel pour leur
accomplissement, et cela pourrait être sublimé au travers d’un projet commun en interaction avec le milieu scolaire afin de
créer une richesse à partager.Il est difficile d'appréhender tous les bienfaits et les évolutions
que l'on peut attendre de la richesse d’une telle expérience personnelle.

I was impressed by their passion and desire to help build a modern Congo while assuring that its natural wealth is not wasted. Honoré will use this work first to get his PhD, but then to continue to monitor the river as additional activities are built along it. It is Honoré and people like him who will help to protect this fragile eco-system and help the country advance without doing too much harm. He needs $500 to finish his thesis, includinng paying for the laboratry analysis of his samples, printing and binding his thesis and paying the school fees necessary. We need people like Honoré to be fully credentialed and empassioned about their work to help protect this fragile environment.</p>

The Nsele River
The Nsele River is said to start in northern Angola and winds its way through Bas Congo before joining the Congo River just above the capitol city of Kinshasa. Along the way because piped water is rare outside Kinshasa, people come to the river to wash themselves, their clothes, their dishes, to take drinking water and throw their waste.

The river is also used to dig sand from the bottom for construction in Kinshasa and for charcoal to come down via canoe for the city. 


There are some spots for leisure activities such as restaurants, a soon-to-open water park and me and my friends have starting kayaking in the last year. There are small industries such as animal husbandry and brick-making already established along the river.

Honoré and his work
While kayaking the Nsele, my friend and I met Honoré and his professor. They are studying the impact of curent activities on the river, inventorying the activities, taking samples and interviewing people who live along the River. I was impressed by their passion and desire to help build a modern Congo while assuring that its natural wealth is not wasted. Honoré will use this work first to get his PhD, but then to continue to monitor the river as additional activities are built along it. It is Honoré and people like him who will help to protect this fragile eco-system and help the country advance without doing too much harm. He needs $500 to finish his thesis, includinng paying for the laboratry analysis of his samples, printing and binding his thesis and paying the school fees necessary. We need people like Honoré to be fully credentialed and empassioned about their work to help protect this fragile environment.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns
