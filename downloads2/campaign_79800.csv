<p>Although classically trained,  I have
always known the importance and richness of the African cultural musical
heritage.  Known as the ""rainbow nation"" South Africa has a diversity of cultures and languages (officially having 11 languages) and as a result is rich in musical
resources. Usually, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">African music is passed on from generation to generation orally. 
However, due to this tradition there is a fear that the African music
may become extinct because, the music has not been preserved or written
down, only passed down orally from generation to generation. Therefore it is
important for African music to be preserved. (If you want to read more about
this, you can look at an article I presented at the 2013 2</span><sup style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">nd</sup><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Annual
international Arts based research and Artistic research conference in Granada,

<p>Being abroad I have also
realized how important it is to preserve the cultural musical heritage of South
Africa. South African music has something
unique to offer the world of music . Being in Europe I
see myself as a cultural bridge between Africa and Europe which allows me to
take the best of both worlds and create something new. The three main benefits of the recording of this CD are:</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">1.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The recording of the

     world about African music which up to this point has not been as largely
     investigated or studied in comparison to other musical genres. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As a songwriter my style of composing is a hybrid  between Soul and African music. I beleve I will be offering something new and unique to the music market.With this Crowd funding campaign, our objective is to raise 7890 euros, in order to record a professional Cd at Escenario Estudios in Alcala, Spain.  We have already recorded a demo in Nomadas Studios, in Andalucía, Spain featuring 4 of my own original songs. You can hear a sample of these songs on sound cloud. This demo features a Senegalese drummer and a Spanish Bassist named Edu Armiño.  We have also created a professional website with, Invoca studio in Siles, Jaen. With this Crowd funding campaign,  we are planning to record a professional CD adding 7 more songs.  We have already reached the halfway mark.  The songs we have already recorded are listed as follows:<br/></span></p>
<p></p><p><br/></p><p>1.  ""Aphrodite""</p><p>2.  ""Namhlanje""</p><p>3.  ""Someday""</p><span></span>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The song <b><i>Namhlanje </i></b> is a song, which is a fusion between
different styles. It also uses African rhythms. The title <b><i>Namhlanje</i></b> , means Today , translated
into IsiXhosa, an indigenous South African language.  It is a song about hope and fighting for your
dreams . 
We are also planning to record a live music video for this song.</p>
<p>The song <b><i>Aphrodite</i></b> is one of my personal favorite
songs. All the songs have a special place in my heart but certain songs tend to capture a moment or an emotion that cannot
be put into words. It talks about the power of a woman and the love of a woman
comparing her to the Greek Goddess Aphrodite. 
My favorite phrase in the song is, <i>She’s so mighty like Aphrodite<b> :)</b></i></p>
<p>Another song, which we have not recorded yet,
but we plan to record, is a song called <b><i>Mbaqanga</i></b>. Mbaqanga is a style of
music and dance in South Africa.  This
song really captures the spirit of South Africa. It gives that Ubuntu feel of
being in a South African township and enjoying the sense of community. A township is similar to a ""favela"". This song utilizes the African rhythms and beats of Mbaqanga.  In the near
future, my team and I would like to go to South Africa, to record this song, in
Africa in the Townships with South African musicians. </p>
<p>Although our  main
objective is to raise the 7890 euros to record a professional CD, this
campaign to me means more than recording a CD. We would like to bring awareness to
musical educational programs in Africa and we would like to donate a small
percentage to an Ngo named <b><i>Agua de Coco</i></b>, who have established a co-curricular  activity in Madagascar to promote Musical Education programs to young children and also to give children a safe haven to go to after school, to keep them off the streets.</p>
<p>I believe that music unites, educates and brings
people together and this is the ideology that my music hopes to achieve. We
should all raise our awareness of important issues in the world and I believe
the most important place to start is through Education.  As the late Tata Nelson Mandela said

</div><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><div>Hi everyone, I am <b>Naomi K</b>, an Australian/Dutch Singer Songwriter &amp; Actor, living in Los Angeles! Music has been my passion for as long as I can remember, and after being in a few bands that could never quite get it together, I decided to take a leap of faith and 3 years ago I officially became a solo artist!! <p></p>
<p>I've been <b>Number 1</b> on the Reverbnation (the new and improved version of MySpace) Singer Songwriter charts for over a year now. I've won various music <b>awards</b> and have had some amazing reviews in a number of music publications too. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I have also just been accepted into the <b>iStandard ‘iWrite’ Songwriter Showcase</b>, LA Edition. It's supported by ASCAP, and <b>i'm one of only 14 Singer Songwriters selected!!</b> Judges include Lex Borerro – (1916 MGMT, Universal Music Group, credits with <b>Maroon 5, Rihanna, Pitbull, Big Sean, Flo Rida, Justin Beiber, Chris Brown, Meek Mill</b> &amp; more), The Frontrunnaz – (Writing duo, Logic, Ray J, Ryan Leslie, Mobb Deep, Redrama &amp; more), and Brandon Kitchen –  (A&amp;R Disney, Grammy Winning Songwriter)  </p>
<p>A link to the event is below, and I will update you all on it's outcome once it's taken place. </p>
<p><a href=""http://istandardproducers.com/events/iwritela91415/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://istandardproducers.com/events/iwritela91415/</a></p>
<p>I've been fortunate enough to cultivate an amazing supportive fan-base of friends and fellow musicians from all over the world, all of which have collectively helped inspire me to keep working on my original material, and take this journey as far as I can go. I've been working  hard on my new music and i'm now ready to take the next step and record my very first full <b>10 track album</b>. I know I can make it happen with your support!</p>
<h3>My Project</h3>
<p>This campaign is raising funds for my debut full studio album. My latest single Take Me Home has been a hit, and is a great example of the new music I will be creating. Click on the link below to <b>download a FREE copy of “Take Me Home”</b>, as a thank you for all your support. </p>

<p>As you know, independent artists like me are making music in a very competitive industry. Your investment in my project is not only helping me record, but it's going to help me create the product I need to push <b>Naomi K</b> forward on mainstream radio, and be heard by top record labels executives. Your investment is also helping me create something really special for you - my best songs yet, recorded at the highest caliber possible, made possible directly through your contribution!</p>
<p><b><b>My Costs</b></b></p>
<p>I was able to cover the costs of recording my 7 singles to date (with various producers) on my own. However I need your help to make my Debut Full 10 track album. Making a professional quality recording is an expensive venture and I can no longer do it alone.  With your support though, this project can become a reality! Your donation to this campaign will go towards covering the following expenses:</p>
<p>1. Pre-production &amp; producer fees</p>
<p>2. Session player recording fees</p>
<p>3. Studio time for recording, mixing, mastering</p>
<p><b>Each song is going to cost $1,500 USD to record</b>.  A full album of 10 songs is therefore going to cost $15,000 USD, which is my campaign goal. If I am able to raise more than this, the additional funds will go towards the costs of manufacturing the CD's and albums, the merchandise, and more.</p>

Rosalie is a vivid storyteller, passionate songwriter, singer, teacher and activist, who has been writing, collecting and performing music for nearly six decades. At 82, Rosalie is no longer able to perform.  We need your help in making a lasting tribute to her artistry and humanity while she is still able to appreciate it.  We have gathered more than 40 musicians from around the country and here in Rosalie's beloved Idaho to record her songs, including Loudon Wainwright, III; Peter Rowan; Nanci Griffith; Tom Russell; Guy Clark; Peggy Seeger and Eilen Jewell!</p> </div> <div> <h3>This is a Huge Undertaking and Time is Short.</h3> <p><b>We already have dozens of songs recorded</b> and many more musicians ready to lend their voices.  We need to complete the final parts of the project that will become a three-CD set featuring voices from country, folk, rock and jazz, each performing a favorite song by Rosalie.  After the recording comes the mixing, pressing, cover design, printing, packaging and more.  </p>
<p><b>Even with people donating most of their time and resources </b>behind the scenes, we need $25,000 to complete the process. The last step will be a CD release concert in Boise, Idaho, featuring several of the guest musicians who perform on the album.  We hope that Rosalie will be able to be front and center at the CD release concert. </p>
<p><b>Every penny raised in the campaign will go into this project</b> and if we are lucky enough to raise more, the rest of the funds will go to help with Rosalie's health care.

</div></div>","Dear Friends,  A group of caring individuals that we call the ""Friends and Family of Rosalie"" are completing a tribute/benefit CD for legendary folksinger Rosalie Sorrels. Rosalie is a vivid storyteller, passionate songwriter, singer, teacher and activist, who has been writing, collecting and performing music for nearly six decades. At 82, Rosalie is no longer able to perform.  We need your help in making a lasting tribute to her artistry and humanity while she is still able to appreciate it.  We have gathered more than 40 musicians from around the country and here in Rosalie's beloved Idaho to record her songs, including Loudon Wainwright, III; Peter Rowan; Nanci Griffith; Tom Russell; Guy Clark; Peggy Seeger and Eilen Jewell!   This is a Huge Undertaking and Time is Short. We already have dozens of songs recorded and many more musicians ready to lend their voices.  We need to complete the final parts of the project that will become a three-CD set featuring voices from country, folk, rock and jazz, each performing a favorite song by Rosalie.  After the recording comes the mixing, pressing, cover design, printing, packaging and more.  
Even with people donating most of their time and resources behind the scenes, we need $25,000 to complete the process. The last step will be a CD release concert in Boise, Idaho, featuring several of the guest musicians who perform on the album.  We hope that Rosalie will be able to be front and center at the CD release concert. 
Every penny raised in the campaign will go into this project and if we are lucky enough to raise more, the rest of the funds will go to help with Rosalie's health care. As a backer of Rosalie's CD Tribute Fund, you will be credited as a supporter.  In addition to the warm feelings of appreciation you'll get, there are also some cool benefits at every level of giving.   A Rich Musical Legacy They don't make musical artists like Rosalie Sorrels anymore.  She was born in Boise into a family of storytellers, journalists, and farmers.  She began performing in the late 1950s, and in the early 1960s, left her husband and piled her five children in the car to drive across the country performing and raising her voice for social justice.  
Along the way, she collected folk songs and performed them on the Smithsonian Folkways label, recorded 22 albums of her own work, and garnered a Grammy nomination for ""The Last Go-Round."" She performed in clubs and at folk festivals with other legendary artists such as Pete Seeger and Utah Phillips and hung out with the likes of Hunter S. Thompson and Ken Kesey.  In 2001 at one of her famous birthday parties, Rosalie was honored for her social activism with a handmade quilt presented by the Boise Peace Quilt Project, an honor shared by Rosa Parks, Helen Caldicott, and Cesar Chavez, among other greats.  Each square of her quilt has been photographed so that some of the images can be printed onto postcards with the lyrics of the songs they represent on the back. (The postcard set is one of the perks you can get as a sponsor.)
Experience at Work
 As a recording artist and performer myself, as well as a producer, I have been working on this CD with Rosalie's family for the past couple of years.  With Rosalie's health becoming increasingly more fragile, we need your help to finish the project by the end of the year, while she can still participate.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to help preserve and document the living legacy of a unique musical and storytelling voice.     Other Ways You Can Help This campaign will work best when it's spread word of mouth.   Please tell the story, mention it on your website, Facebook or Twitter, or send a personal email to your friends who you know love the music of this great folksinging legend, Rosalie Sorrels.  
Your help and support is appreciated!

Leur rencontre est fusionnelle et le chant appelle la guitare. De leur musique naît un couple; de ce couple naît un fils « Ewen » ; de ce fils provient l'origine du nom du projet « <strong>Weend'ô</strong> ». Cette fenêtre vers le monde, vers l’inconnu, vers la dualité, vers l’union.</p><p>C'est avec méthode, humilité, simplicité, patience, persévérance, indépendance et sacrifices que ce couple passionné crée son propre univers musical.</p><p>En 2008, Weend'ô finalise son identité avec l’arrivée de trois nouveaux membres, Rod à la guitare, Maxime à la basse et Donovan à la batterie. Le groupe gagne en maturité et voit l'arrivée d’un nouveau batteur en la personne de Nathanaël en juillet 2010. Il s’attaque en octobre 2010 à l’enregistrement de <strong>son premier album («<i>You Need To Know Yourself</i>»)</strong> avec Olivier Marot, producteur indépendant de Balance Association, au studio ART TOP près d'Angoulême, <strong>suite à leur 1<sup>er</sup> prix aquitain du concours Top Rock des Indépendants.</strong></p><p>Weend'ô y explore l'être humain en profondeur. Les textes écrits par Lætitia sont tirés d'expérience vécues et les musiques laissent transparaître un <strong>rock mélodique progressif</strong> teinté de puissants riffs parfois asymétriques, Weend'ô accompagnant l’auditeur – spectateur dans un voyage sonore inoubliable.</p><p><strong>Leur 1<sup>er</sup> album CD/DVD</strong> <strong>sorti en janvier 2012</strong> <strong>marque d’emblée la scène rock</strong>. Les webzines parlent <strong>« d’un joyau incandescent » (Metalkiller)</strong> ou bien « <strong>un grand coup de cœur, Weend’ô est vraiment un groupe à découvrir</strong>… album de qualité, original qui plus est. » (Neoprog) ou bien encore « Le groupe assène un grand coup à la scène progressive. » (Spirit of Rock). Le groupe est <strong>nommé « meilleur groupe et meilleur album en novembre 2012 » dans un webzine rock métal au Brésil. L’album fait même parti du Top 5 de Musicwaves ! </strong></p><p>Ce début 2013 marquera également un changement de line up. Après le départ du 2nd guitariste, Weend’ô évolue désormais sur scène à 4. Le groupe propose une nouvelle version de leur 1er album avec de nouveaux arrangements apportés par un claviériste de renommée internationale, Stéphane Deriau-Reine (Los Angeles). + de 100 radios diffuseront ces nouvelles versions grâce à l’intervention d’un attaché de presse qui a vu le potentiel du groupe. <strong>En Mai 2013</strong> , Weend'ô est  cité comme <strong>« La Grande Révélation » au Festival International Prog Sud près de Marseilles.</strong></p><p><strong>En seulement 2 ans, Weend'ô fidélise un public et grâce au financement de ses fans par le biais du site « kisskissbankbank » le groupe réussit une collecte de 4251€ pour son projet acoustique du 1er album . </strong></p><p><strong>Véritable hommage à l'Amour de l'Art, le DVD « <i>Weend'ô </i><i>Fairytal’acoustic</i></strong> <strong>» </strong>est une<strong> </strong>fusion artistique entre la musique, la danse, la haute couture, la sculpture, la peinture et le cinéma. <strong>Weend’ô nous délivre avec cette œuvre la quintessence de son talent</strong>. On connaissait la Force de Weend’ô dans leur version électrique, on reste littéralement subjugué par la pureté et la beauté spirituelle de ce groupe avec cette version acoustique !</p><p>Le groupe s’accorde un temps de pause à partir de juin 2014 jusqu’à mars 2015 pour des projets d’ordre personnels.</p><p><strong>Weend’ô revient en force en 2015, le 22 avril, en étant le guest du grand groupe anglais emblématique dans le rock progressif : ARENA</strong>, affiche unique en France (Toulouse).

 MERCI ENORMEMENT POUR VOTRE BELLE ENERGIE PARTAGEE DANS CE NOUVEAU PROJET !​ BIOGRAPHIE DE WEENDO :  membres : Laetitia Chaudemanche (chant/clavier/textes)Terence Nguyen Van (guitare/arrangements)Maxime Rami (Basse)Nathanaël Buis (batterie/samples/visuels) « Sans la musique, la vie serait une erreur » (Nietzsche)Cette philosophie définit parfaitement la vision des deux fondateurs du groupe, Térence et Lætitia. Leur rencontre est fusionnelle et le chant appelle la guitare. De leur musique naît un couple; de ce couple naît un fils « Ewen » ; de ce fils provient l'origine du nom du projet « Weend'ô ». Cette fenêtre vers le monde, vers l’inconnu, vers la dualité, vers l’union.C'est avec méthode, humilité, simplicité, patience, persévérance, indépendance et sacrifices que ce couple passionné crée son propre univers musical.En 2008, Weend'ô finalise son identité avec l’arrivée de trois nouveaux membres, Rod à la guitare, Maxime à la basse et Donovan à la batterie. Le groupe gagne en maturité et voit l'arrivée d’un nouveau batteur en la personne de Nathanaël en juillet 2010. Il s’attaque en octobre 2010 à l’enregistrement de son premier album («You Need To Know Yourself») avec Olivier Marot, producteur indépendant de Balance Association, au studio ART TOP près d'Angoulême, suite à leur 1er prix aquitain du concours Top Rock des Indépendants.Weend'ô y explore l'être humain en profondeur. Les textes écrits par Lætitia sont tirés d'expérience vécues et les musiques laissent transparaître un rock mélodique progressif teinté de puissants riffs parfois asymétriques, Weend'ô accompagnant l’auditeur – spectateur dans un voyage sonore inoubliable.Leur 1er album CD/DVD sorti en janvier 2012 marque d’emblée la scène rock. Les webzines parlent « d’un joyau incandescent » (Metalkiller) ou bien « un grand coup de cœur, Weend’ô est vraiment un groupe à découvrir… album de qualité, original qui plus est. » (Neoprog) ou bien encore « Le groupe assène un grand coup à la scène progressive. » (Spirit of Rock). Le groupe est nommé « meilleur groupe et meilleur album en novembre 2012 » dans un webzine rock métal au Brésil. L’album fait même parti du Top 5 de Musicwaves ! Ce début 2013 marquera également un changement de line up. Après le départ du 2nd guitariste, Weend’ô évolue désormais sur scène à 4. Le groupe propose une nouvelle version de leur 1er album avec de nouveaux arrangements apportés par un claviériste de renommée internationale, Stéphane Deriau-Reine (Los Angeles). + de 100 radios diffuseront ces nouvelles versions grâce à l’intervention d’un attaché de presse qui a vu le potentiel du groupe. En Mai 2013 , Weend'ô est  cité comme « La Grande Révélation » au Festival International Prog Sud près de Marseilles.En seulement 2 ans, Weend'ô fidélise un public et grâce au financement de ses fans par le biais du site « kisskissbankbank » le groupe réussit une collecte de 4251€ pour son projet acoustique du 1er album . Véritable hommage à l'Amour de l'Art, le DVD « Weend'ô Fairytal’acoustic » est une fusion artistique entre la musique, la danse, la haute couture, la sculpture, la peinture et le cinéma. Weend’ô nous délivre avec cette œuvre la quintessence de son talent. On connaissait la Force de Weend’ô dans leur version électrique, on reste littéralement subjugué par la pureté et la beauté spirituelle de ce groupe avec cette version acoustique !Le groupe s’accorde un temps de pause à partir de juin 2014 jusqu’à mars 2015 pour des projets d’ordre personnels.Weend’ô revient en force en 2015, le 22 avril, en étant le guest du grand groupe anglais emblématique dans le rock progressif : ARENA, affiche unique en France (Toulouse). Retour marqué par leur performance au Festival Garonna Show en Juillet 2015, en tête d’affiche de la scène d’entrée !Depuis l’été 2016, Weend’ô travaille sur le 2ème album….Le groupe souhaite être prêt à œuvrer pour le plus grand bonheur de tous à l’automne 2017 avec une tournée France/Angleterre !    Un groupe français à suivre de près, et à découvrir en Live !!

<p><strong>PROJECT INTRODUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Hello my name is Honey from the band, Honey and The Emperor. I am singer-songwriter/ musician, performing artist, and dancer. I am working on my second Album, Moon Dream and I need your help. I graduated from The New School University with a double B.A in Literature and Dance. I also am a Reiki Master Healer and Yoga Teacher, serving to uplift and heal our community. I am a teacher of the arts, teaching Music, Theater and Dance to children at The Rabbit Hole Theater in SF. I am establishing my own unique business as a Musician, Healer, and Performing artist. I have new and exciting work to share with you, but I just can’t do it alone.  Help me finish my second Album, Moon Dream.</p>
<p>My passion is music. My goal with music is to uplift, heal and share creative musical experiences in our community and world. In 2014, the band Honey and the Emperor was established and we have played shows all over the bay area, at cafes, in galleries, record stores, venues, and on the streets of Oakland. In 2015, I came out with my debut Album, LA MER with producer Geoff Saba at Itinerant Home Recordings. With your help and support I was able to pay for production of the last Album LA MER. I am overjoyed to announce that we are working on birthing this next piece of work.</p>
<p>Geoff and I are collaborating again, working my second Album, Moon Dream: Chapter 1, which has felt like a long, eye-opening, process. Currently, I am at a standstill. I need help in the completion of this project. I need help in the cost for mixing and mastering these songs. I long to share more songs with you. I need your support. I am humbled and excited by this creative process of making music, however I can’t do it alone. By helping me release these songs you can help me continue to grow my career and goals as a singer, musician and performer. My prayer with this work is that it is able to shed light and love into this world, inspire you too to create and move toward your dreams. Art making is a collective effort, all of our creative visions matter, adding unique shapes and colors to this creative experience of life.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>My main goal with this project is to complete the 5 songs that we are  almost done recording. I have two more songs to add backing vocals to, which will cost 80 dollars more. Then they will be ready for the mixing and mastering process. Each song costs 70 dollars to be mixed and 80 dollars per song to be mastered. This is a total of 750 dollars, that is just to complete the first part of the project. Due to financial set backs, I’ve had to break the album up into two projects. Moon Dream: Chapter 1 and Moon Dream: Chapter 2. I am supper excited to share that I have <strong>more new songs that didn’t make it onto this album</strong> and I would love to also share these with you. For these I'd need an estimate amount of 6 hours per song ($16 per hour) for 5 songs, which would come to 480 dollars, plus the mixing and mastering fee, which would make the Part 2 of the Album $1230 dollars. Add this to Moon Dream: Part one, put it all together and you get roughly $2,000.</p>
<p>A very important cause for this fundraiser is to raise more money to pay the band. As musicians we work really hard, any extra money will contribute to these causes: helping fund Part 2 of the Album, paying my amazing bandmates, making music videos, and renting rehearsal/ performance spaces/theaters for shows. My collaborators Bryan Lovett, Brian Fogg, Joel Davidson, and Geoff Saba helped make this Album happen, spending long hours in the recording studio and rehearsals.  Also, a big dream of mine is build a show with these songs, with a storyline and characters and put it up on the stage. I'd love to make a theatrical music show with these songs and take these songs on Tour. Help me raise another $600 to help fund these numerous causes, and get these dreams in motion. </p>
<p>For your support, I’d love to offer you this music with a bunch of really great perks. What you get is directly from the heart. For contributing, there are many great perks for you. You can chose from any of these options; get a downloadable copy of the Album, (Moon Dream), custom made Tapes with Album Art and Lyrics on the inside, free tickets to the release party, chakra bracelets (made by yours truly), Reiki and (Distant Reiki for those far away) and more. This all comes from my heart with great gratitude. We are all devoted, hard working musicians, eager to share this work with you. Music is my deepest joy and honor and what keeps me alive. Help Honey and The Emperor grow. Help me get this dazzling music out there.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>We need more music and art on this planet, especially right now. We musicians and artists look to you for love and support. I am devoted to making music, theater and dance to help better our culture and uniting our hearts. Contributing to this project will be of great impact to you and the community. These songs I have written from my heart and I believe have the power to connect and heal. These songs are reflections of my direct experience and hopefully can offer you inspiration, and new ways of seeing the world. Through the mediums of music, we can interact with poetry, storytelling and collage, it's a  beautiful way to enrich our experience and create peaceful connection with one another. Life is built of moments, music helps distill and open the moment (time and space). Music can change reality to calm and even center, the mind/ body/spirit into new perspectives.The power of music has changed my life beyond measure, it has healed heart break, career changes, steered my mind from depression to joy, shifting my relationships into love and acceptance. It's helped me see and feel connection in this world. This makes the impact of this Album and performing these songs very important to me and important for me to share with you. Music is my daily act of prayer and devotion. Through this project I’d love to raise awareness of the importance of women and the music scene, where its not always easy. I'm not saying that to get sympathy, I'm saying it because it's what I have experienced first hand, period. There is something unique, raw, and personal here in this new album, Moon Dream. I hope I can share all 10 songs with you. They are birthed from direct experience; in dreams and waking life.  Most importantly by contributing, this will help complete over a year long project and will help future projects move forward, so that I can put out the next wave of songs, that are also ready to start recording. With your help, we can make it happen, we can build a team, a strong community of Honey and The Emperor supporters. With more support, I’ll be able to finish the album , finish the sequel Moon Dream: Part two. Hopefully, one day I'll get these songs on the stage,  we'll be able travel more, taking these songs on tour. That's the over arching dream! This is an eye opening process and it is very humbling to say the least, help make this second Album, Moon Dream, reach fruition. The music in Moon Dream is waiting to soar into your hearts. </p>
<p><strong>OVERCOMING OBSTACLES</strong></p>
<p>This process of recording and the music scene has not always been easy. Finding time, money and trust worthy resources, has been really challenging for me this year. Trusting the process has been an eye opening opportunity to get clear about my goals. I have dedicated my life to music and dance, working hard as a professional dancer and musician for over a decade. This year has been particularly hard, and sometimes I have wanted to give up, bc shows fall through, bands fall apart, the nitty gritty gets gritty. Yet, somehow I still wake up and write songs and love expressing myself in this way. It feels like what I was put on this earth to do. I put long hours, hard work and effort into this work and love it more than anything. The abundance I feel about this work, is not always reflected in my bank account. I work with and for people who are all very talented musicians/artists, who also struggle with similar circumstances. Help us grow so I can pay the band, finish album, and travel with this music more. We would love your support in helping us finish this project.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>I understand a lot of us our going through life in many different ways. If you can't contribute at this time, that is totally ok, I LOVE YOU. There are other ways you could help. Share this fundraiser on Facebook, Instagram (everywhere) with your friends, family and community, through email and social media. <strong>Please</strong> <strong>help me get the word out there to share with people that could support this project</strong>. Thank you so much for reading this and being wonderful humans. You helped us do our work with the last project, which I am deeply grateful for. Please help us take this music to the next level, share and spread this  music into our community, uplifting the collective human heart. Asking for help is the most vulnerable and humbling aspect of living as a musician and artist. I am deeply grateful and indebted to you for your kindness, love and support. My heart soars with love from your generosity and am so very, very grateful. I really couldn't do it with out you. Thank you. Om peace, peace, peace.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in LIT SOUL and our brand new album! We would love for you to help support LIT SOUL in funding this release. Now this is no regular fundraiser as we are not asking for a freebie. The perks are FOR YOU in this and they are really great. We have put together a list of perks that we think you will enjoy, and have a variety of price ranges available.</p>
<p>*Photos of all the Perks are available right under the video at the top! </p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise enough money to complete the 6<sup>th</sup> album by LIT SOUL. We have three music albums and two poetry albums and one is with music. This will be the 4th music album and 6th overall piece of art from LIT SOUL. The music industry has changed quite a bit since the days of big labels and record deals, and most independent bands do all of the legwork themselves in the hopes that their art is created and heard.</p>
<p>This campaign and this album are extremely important to LIT SOUL because this is the first album with our new line-up, and we feel this is the strongest line-up to date. We are really excited about this release because it showcases a new direction for the band that fans of HIM, The Cult, Danzig, Neil Young, Type O Negative will love.</p>
<p>We really like giving back to our fans and feel that by having an IndieGoGo Campaign we can give fans the opportunity to be part of the process from the beginning and get the new album, past releases, new merchandise, and additional perks before anyone else has a chance to. This is a great opportunity to get LIT SOUL merchandise at affordable prices, support independent rock n’ roll, and feel good about helping independent artists follow their dreams.</p>
<p>Contributors will help us achieve our goal of creating the 6<sup>th</sup> album by LIT SOUL, which is an extended EP including a video. There are a lot of costs that go into recording a CD, including the recording process itself, mixing, and mastering. In addition, there are a lot of costs that go into rehearsing to prepare for the CD, and then there is the cost of producing the actual CD itself. We have already started the recording process for one of the songs and hope to raise at least $2200.00 to help complete the rest of the album.  </p>
<p>All money raised will go towards the production of our upcoming album, even if we don’t reach our goal. If we exceed our goal, the additional money will be spent on video production for our first single, ""You Blessed My Eyes With Your Cruelty.""</p>
<p>Our biggest obstacle is coming up with the funding to create professional music. With all of the costs involved and limited budget we needed to turn to you for support. Independent artists are now doing a lot on their own, and depending on their fan bases for support. It’s difficult for musicians these days since music is so easily accessible for free.</p>
<p>We really appreciate your support for LIT SOUL and for our campaign. Please spread the word about our campaign, share this post on your social media, and tell your friends. Every bit helps! Just use the IndieGoGo Share Tools right here!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been playing guitar since 2010 and have been dreaming of recording an album since 2012, but it has been delayed many times for a multitude of reasons.  I have since added improved content and matured in my playing and composing.  Expressing myself through my art means the world to me and I want it to impact others too, but I need your support to get there.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Your funds will go towards the cost of studio recording time, the cost of mixing/mastering, album art/other graphic design, printing, and physical/electronic distribution.</p>
<p>These funds won't come solely from donation, but your advance purchase of goods and/or services including electronic downloads, physical CD copies, guitar lessons, a fanned fret guitar, or even a house concert!</p>
<p>Even if we don't meet our total goal, all funds raised will minimize my out of pocket cost to record this album.  Essentially I'm trying to not be a starving artist from the very start.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>Whether or not you have the available funds to contribute financially to this campaign, sharing across your social media platform helps tremendously!  Please feel free to share and to do so regularly.  Everyone I'm close to would back this with or without the campaign, so help me get the word out to everyone else that you know and I don't that may be interested.  </p>
<p>I truly appreciate any and all support from everyone!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Much love,</p>

I have been playing guitar since 2010 and have been dreaming of recording an album since 2012, but it has been delayed many times for a multitude of reasons.  I have since added improved content and matured in my playing and composing.  Expressing myself through my art means the world to me and I want it to impact others too, but I need your support to get there.
What We Need & What You Get

Your funds will go towards the cost of studio recording time, the cost of mixing/mastering, album art/other graphic design, printing, and physical/electronic distribution.
These funds won't come solely from donation, but your advance purchase of goods and/or services including electronic downloads, physical CD copies, guitar lessons, a fanned fret guitar, or even a house concert!
Even if we don't meet our total goal, all funds raised will minimize my out of pocket cost to record this album.  Essentially I'm trying to not be a starving artist from the very start.
Other Ways You Can Help
Whether or not you have the available funds to contribute financially to this campaign, sharing across your social media platform helps tremendously!  Please feel free to share and to do so regularly.  Everyone I'm close to would back this with or without the campaign, so help me get the word out to everyone else that you know and I don't that may be interested.  
I truly appreciate any and all support from everyone!
 
Much love,

If you’re a fan of NBC’s <strong>The Voice</strong>, you may recognize me as a contestant on <strong>Gwen Stefani’s team</strong> from <strong>Season 7</strong>. It was a life-changing experience, and I am so grateful to have been given the opportunity to share my story and talent with the world. Since then, I've recorded and released my own EP called <i>Summertime State of Mind</i> and have performed all over NY, PA, MA and CT to promote it!</p><p>But It’s been over two years since I released that EP, and I owe you all some new music big time! I’ve been writing a ton of new songs, and I’m really excited to share them with you!</p><h3><i>The EP</i></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501532024/w35bs3pcjb3cpbbmaxjv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>I've been back in the studio and have teamed up with producer <strong>Sam Polizzi</strong> to create something really fresh and new. We have sifted through tons of songs and decided on 6 that really spoke to us. I can confidently say this EP is completely different than anything I've released so far. </p><p>For this CD, I wanted to show another side of me - the side that hurts, that makes mistakes, the side that's not all sunshine and butterflies. It's darker, more personal and full of emotion. All these songs have been inspired by my life stories, but are relatable no matter who you are or where you've been.</p><p>I believe this album is a start to something really great, and I really want you to be a part of it!</p><h3><i>Why Pledge?</i></h3><p>I have been so blessed to have such awesome support in my life - family, friends and fans included! You all inspire me to work harder and persevere, but sometimes it's not easy. I'm not good at asking for help, but I've realized that <strong>I can't do this alone</strong>, nor do I want to. I need your help now more than ever, and I'm <strong>not ashamed</strong> to let you know!</p><h3><i>Why Now?</i></h3><p>I recorded my last EP in the comforts of a practice space and living room, with little more than a $100 microphone. While it was cool to say it was a DIY release, I felt it was time to take things to the next level and record a <strong>fully-produced, studio EP</strong>.</p><p>Quality doesn't come cheap, but I've done my best and have been able to cover all recording costs, including hiring some kick-ass musicians! So the <strong>good news</strong> is the songs are already written and recorded. The <strong>bad news</strong> is production has come to a stopping point until I can cover the costs to mix and master the songs. But it doesn't stop there!</p><h3><i>The Costs</i></h3><p><strong>I not only want to make music my career, I want to change people's lives. </strong>In order to do that, I not only need to finish the EP, but I need to make music videos, pay for a radio promo campaign and get my music coast to coast! Here's a breakdown of where your contribution will go:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501533234/qy4qheo8fb1xadw6vosi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504269354/djv9trfnbuicw78i1ihf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><i>The Rewards</i></h3><p>The last thing I want is for you to leave here feeling empty handed.

Since then, I've recorded and released my own EP called Summertime State of Mind and have performed all over NY, PA, MA and CT to promote it!But It’s been over two years since I released that EP, and I owe you all some new music big time! I’ve been writing a ton of new songs, and I’m really excited to share them with you!The EPI've been back in the studio and have teamed up with producer Sam Polizzi to create something really fresh and new. We have sifted through tons of songs and decided on 6 that really spoke to us. I can confidently say this EP is completely different than anything I've released so far. For this CD, I wanted to show another side of me - the side that hurts, that makes mistakes, the side that's not all sunshine and butterflies. It's darker, more personal and full of emotion. All these songs have been inspired by my life stories, but are relatable no matter who you are or where you've been.I believe this album is a start to something really great, and I really want you to be a part of it!Why Pledge?I have been so blessed to have such awesome support in my life - family, friends and fans included! You all inspire me to work harder and persevere, but sometimes it's not easy. I'm not good at asking for help, but I've realized that I can't do this alone, nor do I want to. I need your help now more than ever, and I'm not ashamed to let you know!Why Now?I recorded my last EP in the comforts of a practice space and living room, with little more than a $100 microphone. While it was cool to say it was a DIY release, I felt it was time to take things to the next level and record a fully-produced, studio EP.Quality doesn't come cheap, but I've done my best and have been able to cover all recording costs, including hiring some kick-ass musicians! So the good news is the songs are already written and recorded. The bad news is production has come to a stopping point until I can cover the costs to mix and master the songs. But it doesn't stop there!The CostsI not only want to make music my career, I want to change people's lives. In order to do that, I not only need to finish the EP, but I need to make music videos, pay for a radio promo campaign and get my music coast to coast! Here's a breakdown of where your contribution will go:The RewardsThe last thing I want is for you to leave here feeling empty handed. So in exchange for your contribution and support, I've come up with some fun rewards to make it worth your while. How about an exclusive acoustic CD thats never been sold before, or a vinyl record with unreleased songs, exclusive to backers only. Tea anyone? Check them out over to the right!Secret PerksI will also be offering secret perks to my mailing list only! If you want access to these exclusive perks, head over to www.amandaleepeers.com, and sign up on my mailing list.Want something that's not listed as a reward?Email me at contact(at)amandaleepeers.com, and I'll do my best to make that reward available!Others Way To HelpYou really want to help but just don't have the funds to contribute...that's okay! You can help by sharing this page on your social media sites and telling all your friends and family about it! The more you help me spread the word, the faster I can finish the EP and get you new music!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sean Hogan and for nearly a quarter of a century, I've been blessed to be able to make music my living. You could argue I've had some great success-- 20 years ago this month, I won my first CCMA, for 1997 Independent Male Artist of the Year; I have gone on to be nominated for and win several other awards for my song writing and singing and have had some great radio hits in Canada as well. In July 2015, I launched my first crowd funding project and completed it two years ago this month.  Now I am launching what I believe is my ""comeback album"", my 7th studio album with 11 new songs, with this promotional support campaign for branding videos and newest original music album. </p>
<p>My last crowd funding project was successful with the release of “Best of” albums, Noteworthy"" Volume Sun and Volume Moon, and gave back over $4,000 to the Canadian Cancer Society from combined affiliated concerts and the sale of fleece scarfs, ""Neck Savers"". (The name originated from my own experience with Stage 4 cancer which I was diagnosed with 6 years ago this month. This past spring marked 5 years cancer free from Stage4A carcinoma).  With this new project, I’m wishing to make two and maybe three new branding music videos finish my next studio album 7Come11, the first full collection of new music from me in 5 years.</p>
<p>Recently I wrote about Huatulco Mexico. A very generous individual who heard my song, and happened to have a business in Huatulco offered to bring me down to assist in making a music video of that song and to cover the cost of transport.  This is cool right!? Indeed very cool; however reality is that it takes more than that to make a video and finish my recordings for this new album. So in part that is what this project is about. I have an opportunity to go there to make these competitive branding music videos. Each video I have made in the past got picked up on national radio. Although there are many things that have changed over the years in the music industry, I believe that music videos still help fans and potential fans to get a sense of an artist's character, style, and breadth of music.  </p>
<p>So at this point, I am asking those supporters from two years ago and new fans I have met and made since, to please consider the fun opportunity to help me pick up where I left off two years ago.  This project is in motion and I'm excited to finish my new album and produce a few new music videos to support the success and completion of my next album.  I would love to have your support and the connectivity of you to my music and I eagerly invite you to come along on a good part of this journey. As a cancer survivor it's so nice to use the word ""journey"" for a change, in a proactive, fun and exciting way!</p>
<p>As an added bonus, there is an opportunity for some to be extras in one of these new videos such as the one in Huatulco if you're there at the time of shooting October 29th to November 5th. Other opportunities will also come later in first quarter of 2018, when I will be back down for some shows in Huatulco, Mexico and at which time we will likely have a contest for the winner of a trip to Huatulco to travel down.</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What Is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So I've told you what I'm doing with any and all raised funds and why I believe I need to do this project to move forward.  I'm happy to discuss with anyone further details about why I am moving forward with this mission. That is should anyone wish to contact me for further conversation about the effects of being impacted by unemployment brought on by illness and or the world of being a full-time performing artist as opposed to being a part time musician and how being a recording and performing artist in the midst of one's career, in my case full-time singer/songwriter for the past 24 years. I welcome any questions you may have.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• Video production costs such as cameraman time per hour per video, (that's  Videographer/Director, Producer, Editor, Sound Engineer, Lighting Engineer, Performers, Make-up Artist, Studio Hire, Props, Costumes, coffee--lots of coffee, and maybe biscuits?... airfare for one video (not in Huatulco), fuel costs, rental vehicles, for technical crew cost such as labour fees, hourly rates for crew assistant personnel, equipment rentals and processing fees, prop and location associated fees, equipment shipping fees, etc.</p>
<p>• Album costs include: studio hourly rates, engineer costs, co-producer fees, musician session fees, mix engineer and mastering fees, as well as any and all equipment rentals, transportation costs including air-fare costs and or vehicle rentals.</p>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong>A chance to win a trip Huatulco and be an extra in the music video for my song ""Huatulco"", the *new album, and a number of great different perks that have been highlighted for you so please check them out!</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>I fully anticipate that a major impact of my new music project will be to greatly assist my ability to reach out, reacquaint and indeed strengthen ties I had before my illness.  This will allow for booking opportunities in both foreign and domestic markets. Your contribution does not go into some general coffers’ account--it is specific to costs in this project critically needed for me to move forward. </p>
<p>The regular shows I do for a living allow me to just get by covering basic living costs and this campaign is needed more than words can express to reactivate where I left off impacting people’s lives for the better with my own hybrid style of music. Having the ability for my music to change and better people’s lives has been behind all of the endeavours I have initiated over the years.  One such initiative is the Canadian Country Christmas concert series, now in its 14th year.  To date this has assisted countless communities across at least eight Provinces in raising funds for their own worthwhile charities and we have succeeded in raising over $200,000 for those organizations. In that time dozens of well-known Country and Roots recording artists have joined me across Canada each fall and we continue to do this to support essential community groups around their most important local issues.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Surviving cancer and overcoming the myriad of challenges and obstacles in my career that seem to come with the territory of an independent artist, have made me a believer that perseverance and then talent are what gets one ahead.</p>
<p>Just to share one example from my career of why I hold this belief, I wrote a benefit song for the flood victims in Southern Alberta in 2013 ""Hell or High-water"" which was my 19th music video on CMT. Many, not all, Country stations thought the song wasn’t “Country” enough and as a result, truth be known, it didn’t get played all that much.  Despite that, we were able to nationally elevate the conversation around bettering conditions that First Nations face in Canada, and it did have an impact and make a positive difference</p>
<p>So I guess to sum up, I’m asking you to support my project and partner with me to continue to making the music and the difference I believe can happen from projects like this.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you can’t contribute in a financial way and here are some other ways that you can help:</p>
<p>• Please share this campaign.  As a bonus, by doing so you will become eligible to win a free house concert and the new album when it's released.  Again, please share this campaign and share it often and greatly as there is a finite window of time to run the campaign to try and make this objective happen. </p>
<p>Thank you my friends, and may good health find you reading this today.</p>
<p>And that's all there is to it.</p>

""From deep within my heart it drips,
honey down to my fingertips, 
A pulling and knowing that the time has come,
to share the music that has been done. 
The vibrations dance inside me now,
but the music is getting  too loud.
I need your help to set them free,

Truly an honor to surrender myself,

<p>Hello legends!</p>
<p>It's Jas here and I'm super excited to finally be releasing my debut album and planning a Summer tour for New Zealand 2018.</p>
<p>Last year I made some pretty big life changes, including leaving my full time job / home and taking the gigantic leap to full time musician/world traveler.  Some once told me ""Ifs it terrifying and amazing... you must pursue it"" so .... Mission accepted.</p>
<p>I recorded ""See what you did there"" with the help of local lyttelton producer/extrodiner Ben Edwards.   After a great two weeks in the studio.. And Bens magic skills ... boom .. an album!  Full with rock riffs, delicious harmonies and even some slower moody tear jerkers.</p>
<p>The album focuses mostly on the time I spent working and living in Asia ... while doing ALOT of people watching (but the acceptable non creepy type)</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to perform at the Edinburgh fringe festival the last two years, where I met many extremely talented musicians ... three of which happen to be joining me for the upcoming tour.</p>
<p>After some great gigs and general life experiences, I invited the girls to come be my kickass band in New Zealand... I can't wait !</p>
<p>The ""See what you did tour' will be rocking around New Zealand in Jan and Feb 2018,</p>
<p>As an independent artist, I want to play and tour all around the world ..  and course one day be friends with Bon Jovi ... but in all honesty, just being to keep creating great music while performing live.</p>
<p>Our journey will take us all over New Zealand in the months of January and February and we are looking at playing all types of venues in all types of cities and towns.</p>
<p>We will be posting weekly vlogs on Youtube to share our incredible experience and to make it feel like you all are there with us every step of the way. We also want to help you all feel inspired to pursue your own dreams, because anything is possible once you decide to take the risks and make your dream a reality!</p>
<p>We are all so excited about New Zealand but we need your help to make this dream a success! We are looking to raise around $10,000 NZD  and any contribution you decide to make will really help us out more than you know.</p>
<p>Here's a quick breakdown of some of the expenses so you can see first hand...</p>
<p>Tour van @ $100 a day $6000</p>
<p>Petrol $600</p>
<p>Food @$10 a day each $2400</p>
<p>Accomodation $6000</p>
<p>Album plus mixing and mastering $10000</p>
<p>Promotion and PR $1000</p>
<p>Total ... $26,000 NZD</p>
<p>It seems these days that as a musician you are always trying to break even ... and touring is no different.  We all really appreciate your support.</p>
<p>We will be  giving away perks to specific donation amounts! Be sure to look on the sidebar to see what you can get when you support this tour with your donation. :)</p>

<h3>Who is Mandy?</h3>
<p>I am! </p>
<p>I am a jazz vocalist and music educator from Alberta. The past seven years I have spent most of my time with kids. I tried to figure out exactly how many but I can't. So to give you an idea, this week (November 2-8, 2017) I have seen 79 children for various types of music lessons. Most days we sing, play piano or ukulele and learn music theory. Other times we just play games and talk. Every day children share their love of music and their view of the world with me.  This is probably my single greatest source of inspiration.</p>
<p>My other passion is jazz. I studied vocal performance at Grant MacEwan University in Edmonton, Alberta and have performed with a variety of groups ranging from small jazz ensembles to dance cover bands to barbershop and other types of acapella groups. I love singing most things but the energy that comes from playing jazz is unlike any other.</p>
<p>Music with Mandy is where these two worlds collide. Jazz is playful and interactive by nature, the musicians are always working together and improvising to make a piece come to life. It is my goal to bring children into this active improvisation at my live performance. I do so by inviting young musicians to perform with me and by creating games out of jazz standards for audience interaction. It is my goal to use this album to take me across Canada to communities big and small and introduce jazz to children and their families. ""On the Sunny Side of the Street"" will be the single most important tool to create connections to communities and introducing my style of music to a younger audience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<ul>
<li>Producing, mixing and mastering</li>
<li>Musicians</li>
<li>Album art and design </li>
<li>Printing fees</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not raise the entire amount I will record a shorter EP instead of a full length album. On the other side, anything extra will go to touring with the album!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>High quality and diverse music needs to be accessible for families. Music with Mandy is making that happen.</p>

Hello, my name is Mauriel Strawbridge aka Mauriel Bizio.  I'm the manager / business partner with Nicky Barness aka Asian C.  I've known Nicky since she was 18.  I noticed she was different that a lot of artist that I have worked with in the past.  With some success, she worked with various groups prior to teaming up with me.  After moderate success with these other groups, she wanted to take her music career to the next level.  We made a deal that was equally beneficial to both of us, she's the artist, I'm the network, kinda like Michael Jackson and MTV.  But there's one problem.



Nicky was involved in a domestic altercation.  Because of legal reasons,  we can't go into details.  Nicky faces an up hill battle.



Currently Nicky is one the right track, being a responsible person and mom first, then an recording artist second.  She works with me during the day, selling home alarm systems.  Thanks to her, I'm the number one sales rep in my local office.  Then we operate our music business during the evening.


Our current projects are:

Building her website www.nickybarness.com
Producing her 12 track mixtape “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”, with 12 music videos.
Her own reality show showing her struggles and successes, (we shoot video every time we meet up)
And her own talk show we she features local talent.

   What We Need & What You Get

We are asking for $7,000 in donations to help produce and market Nicky Barnes music, studio time, Facebook, and Youtube adds, Local flyers, local Television Advertisements, and other projects listed.  


    
Other Ways You Can Help All donations will be greatly appreciated, another way you can help is to share our story on your social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.  Also, don't forget that we sell home alarms, so if you know someone who has gotten broken into, or you know someone who just moved into a new home, have them contact us.  We can service them anywhere country.

<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>My name's Beth and I live and work in the Derbyshire Peak District where I run a small creative business called Rowan Song.  I have a lifelong passion for music and have been writing songs in the folk genre for the past 20 years or so.  This album of all original material expresses the themes that I love to work with creatively...the voices of the land that I live on, the spirits of place and the mythologies that are woven into our natural spaces through history and storytelling. </p>
<p>The Dark Peak has been my home for the past 10 years, taking me on a journey of healing and transformation.  I so much want to share the magic and beauty of this place that has enchanted me for the past decade. At a time when so much of our landscape is under the threat of environmental harm there is more need than ever to celebrate and honour our natural spaces.  This collection of songs aims to do that and to inspire others to listen to the voices of their own special places within nature. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493573257/ay64gcj3bubejmcfgta9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To make this album and create a physical CD product we ideally need to raise a minimum of £2200.  This will cover recording time in a small local studio, mastering, registrations and a run of professionally replicated CDs.  It breaks down like this:</p>
<p>Recording/Mastering - £1250</p>
<p>CD Replication - £600</p>
<p>Registrations - £150</p>
<p>Artwork - I will be doing this myself!</p>
<p>There will also be campaign costs of the 5% fee we incur for using the Indiegogo platform plus card payment fees.  </p>
<p>Total: £2200</p>
<p>That's the minimum, but if we raise more than that then it opens up the possibility to meet some of our stretch goals which would be super amazing!  They go like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>£2500 </strong>would allow us to make a fuller booklet for the CD with lyrics</li>
<li>
<strong>£3500 </strong>would allow us to upgrade our equipment for live performance which would open up where we could take this music to share</li>
<li>
<strong>£6000 </strong>would see us back in the studio for a second album (Faery Tails) which is already written and waiting!</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let's have a look at those <strong>rewards and perks</strong>...</p>

<li> a <strong>digital download combined with an extra track </strong>from the next album...a special preview which will only be available via this campaign. </li>
<li>
<b>CD </b>of the Voice of the Moor album will also be available once we have secured enough donations to fund the majority of that part of the project (see Plan B below!)</li>
<li>
<strong>In person concerts</strong>! I will come to your venue with any size of audience and give you a <strong>full recital of all the songs from the album</strong> plus some new songs that you will be the very first people to hear! Any questions, just ask! This is a great option if you have a bit more to spend or want to get together as a group or moot to combine your donations.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also other creative rewards on offer, handmade by myself - choose from <strong>ceramic jewellery... </strong></p>

<p>In case you can't decide, I've also put together some bundles for you which give you a little bit of a discount on some of the items :)</p>
<p>New rewards will be rolled out to the campaign page as we go along, so check back with us every so often to see what's new!</p>
<p>There is an unavoidable shipping charge for physical rewards, but I have tried to keep this as low as possible. </p>
<p>Do remember to check when the shipping date for your reward is.  Obviously the album in any format can only be delivered once it is complete.  We are estimating end of 2017 for this assuming everything runs smoothly.  If there are delays for any reason then you will be informed by email.  Other rewards that need to be hand made may also take some time to produce so please bear with me while I create your items for you.</p>

<p>So...what happens if we don't reach our target?  Well, I am trusting we will, but just in case, then there is a Plan B!  Assuming we have raised enough to cover the recording costs then we will go ahead and record the album. We will then release it digitally for sale online.  This will get the album out there while we work on raising the remaining funds to support the production of the physical CD. For this reason I will only make a CD reward available once we have received enough donations to fund the majority of that part of the project. </p>

<p>At this time in humanity's relationship with the earth it is more important than ever for people to feel connected to and a part of the spaces and places they inhabit. When we listen to the voices and stories of the land we exist upon, watch them transform and turn through the seasons, it creates the possibility for a new and deeper kind of relationship with nature and the places that we call home. </p>
<p>This collection of songs explores my own journey of relationship with the places that call out to me in this way.  I hope that sharing them with a wider audience will inspire others to explore their own relationship, to remember the stories that the land holds for them and will share if they quiet their minds to hear.  I believe there is great value in that both for people and for our planet.  I would love it if you could help me make this happen!</p>
<p>As someone with a strong creative background and the owner of a creative business, I also have a great track record  in taking the seed of an idea and seeing it all the way through to a finished product.  I know how to plant, nourish and harvest! I also take my responsibility to the people supporting me very seriously (I wouldn't have a business if I didn't!) so if this project is crowdfunded I am keen to honour that trust and belief in me and this album.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493574480/gsybbibwc0cvkeudk7kw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>While this project would represent a new kind of creative project with new challenges, I am really excited by that.  My creative background has given me a heap of transferable skills developed over many years, so I am confident in my ability to see it through to an end product. </p>
<p>However, there are also new challenges related to the administrative side of releasing an album that must be addressed to ensure it is released in a form that can be sold and listened to across the greatest variety of outlets.  To deal with this I have researched thoroughly and sought the advice of more experienced recording artists to make sure I have allowed for these in the budget.</p>

<p>Not everyone can contribute and we totally understand that.  However, if you'd like to support the project in a different way then please share this campaign in any way you can on social media, with friends and family and/or with anyone you think might be interested.  We value and appreciate every kind of support! </p>

<ul></ul>
</div><div> </div></div>","Welcome!
My name's Beth and I live and work in the Derbyshire Peak District where I run a small creative business called Rowan Song.  I have a lifelong passion for music and have been writing songs in the folk genre for the past 20 years or so.  This album of all original material expresses the themes that I love to work with creatively...the voices of the land that I live on, the spirits of place and the mythologies that are woven into our natural spaces through history and storytelling. 
The Dark Peak has been my home for the past 10 years, taking me on a journey of healing and transformation.  I so much want to share the magic and beauty of this place that has enchanted me for the past decade. At a time when so much of our landscape is under the threat of environmental harm there is more need than ever to celebrate and honour our natural spaces.  This collection of songs aims to do that and to inspire others to listen to the voices of their own special places within nature. 

To make this album and create a physical CD product we ideally need to raise a minimum of £2200.  This will cover recording time in a small local studio, mastering, registrations and a run of professionally replicated CDs.  It breaks down like this:
Recording/Mastering - £1250
CD Replication - £600
Registrations - £150
Artwork - I will be doing this myself!
There will also be campaign costs of the 5% fee we incur for using the Indiegogo platform plus card payment fees.  
Total: £2200
That's the minimum, but if we raise more than that then it opens up the possibility to meet some of our stretch goals which would be super amazing!  They go like this:


£2500 would allow us to make a fuller booklet for the CD with lyrics

£3500 would allow us to upgrade our equipment for live performance which would open up where we could take this music to share

£6000 would see us back in the studio for a second album (Faery Tails) which is already written and waiting!


So, let's have a look at those rewards and perks...
I have a range of special goodies for you to choose from!  If you'd like a musical reward then you can choose:

a digital download of the Voice of the Moor album on completion
 a digital download combined with an extra track from the next album...a special preview which will only be available via this campaign. 

CD of the Voice of the Moor album will also be available once we have secured enough donations to fund the majority of that part of the project (see Plan B below!)

In person concerts! I will come to your venue with any size of audience and give you a full recital of all the songs from the album plus some new songs that you will be the very first people to hear!

<h3>Concept Rock in the Alamo City</h3>
<p>As if we needed more reasons to love the flourishing arts scene in San Antonio! Everything about our original show speaks to the talent and passion for excellence we have in our city. From the show's story creators and music composers (Ricky, Richard, and Tito), the vocalists (13 of them who sing their butts off, including lead vocalists <a href=""https://lucasjackmusic.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lucas Jack</a> &amp; <a href=""https://bekahkelso.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bekah Kelso</a>), the 5 piece house band (a.k.a. the badass driving force of wild prog/pop rock at the center of our show), the multi-media content producer (award-winning artist <a href=""http://danielariojas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daniela Riojas </a>will be creating and curating this dynamic and vital component of the show), sound and light technician (the best!), recording engineer/mixing/mastering house (yo <a href=""http://zincmediapro.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zinc Media</a>!), right down to the awesome local print company who will press our CDs and posters (Core Media), the wonderful non-profit presenting our performance (we love <a href=""http://www.musicprojecttx.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The M.U.S.I.C. Project</a>) and the community theater house that will host our performance (the Josephine Theater), EVERYTHING about Paradise City is showing San Antonio the love.</p>
<p>Ricky, Tito and Richard, friends and veterans of the San Antonio music scene, first began writing the show in the 1980s after working on previous projects together, including the psychedelic rock opera ""Alice"", which made big waves in central TX in the 70s and 80s. Over the years, Paradise City took many forms but was never completed. Until now! Finally, with your help, it is coming into full performance fruition. </p>
<p>Though composer and friend Tito Villalobos Moreno is no longer with us on this physical plane, his spirit is infused in the music of Paradise City. We are so happy that his son, Tomas Villalobos Moreno, a very talented graphic designer, did the artwork for our poster, deepening the link between Tito's legacy and this special project. A portion of proceeds from ticket sales will benefit The M.U.S.I.C. Project and The Tito Villalobos Moreno Memorial Scholarship Fund.</p>
<p>The music of Paradise City tells the story of a small-town rock band, Jimmy and The Heroes, and their journey to a colorful new city where crowds flock to promises of freedom and excess. There they find friendship and even love as Jimmy meets a drifter named Jenny. All seems perfect in Paradise, until the truth is revealed about the forces fueling the city. Things aren't what they thought it would be. Love and loyalty are tested. Is Paradise City a dream or can Jimmy and Jenny make it a reality?</p>
<p><strong>We have the music, the story, and the talent. Now all we need is YOU!</strong></p>

<p><strong>THOMAS BABE, CO-LIBRETTIST</strong></p>
<p>""Tesla"" Co-Script writer Thomas Babe was one of a group of 70s US playwrights who laid the ground for the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Aaron Sorkin. Like David Mamet and Sam Shepard, his plays contain half-crazed but intelligent, articulate characters. Darker passions of the human soul feature strongly Mr. Babe's writing first came to widespread attention in 1975, when his play Kid Champion, with Christopher Walken as a physically and emotionally broken rock star, bowed at the Public. Mr. Babe's plays were often populated by mythic figures from history. Fathers and Sons, for instance, featured Wild Bill Hickok. (The play was later the basis of a 1995 Walter Hill film starring Jeff Bridges, the screenplay for which Mr. Babe co-wrote.) And Salt Lake City Skyline concerned Joe Hill. A then-unfamous John Lithgow played the labor leader. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494126848/yp1k4moqptoaqakphp83.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>The cast of Thomas Babe's ""Taken in Marriage"" at the Public Theater</p>
<p>Mr. Babe's work rarely lacked for top acting talent like John Lithgow and Walken. A Prayer for My Daughter, set in a police station, starred the solid foursome of Jeffrey DeMunn, George Dzundza, Laurence Luckinbill and Alan Rosenberg. Rebel Women featured Mandy Patinkin and Peter Weller. And the cast of Buried Inside Extra—a rare play directed by Joe Papp himself — included Hal Holbrook, Dixie Carter, Vincent Gardenia and Sandy Dennis. Taken in Marriage, the women of a well-off New York family are gathered in the basement of a New Hampshire church for a wedding rehearsal starred Dixie Carter, Colleen Dewhurst, Kathleen Quinlan and Meryl Streep. </p>

We wanted to do something very different from the music we’ve each made in the past: to create music that reflects our activism and work for social justice and music that would create a space for our friends and our community to dance and feel safe and powerful. We think that is a gift we can give back to the city and the community that has nurtured both of us.</p> <p><strong>Leo Ferguson</strong> is a drummer, composer and producer who came up in NYC as a musician playing punk-y Riot Grrrl music in high school, studied jazz performance, listened to hip-hop and spent years composing with a pencil and paper.

We are donating at least 5% of what we raise to JC in honor of the late and beloved Daniel Majesty Sanchez who worked there as a volunteer and then staff member. Founded in 1985, The Justice Committee is a grassroots organization dedicated to building a movement against police violence and systemic racism in New York City and empowering low-income Latino/as and other people of color to address these issues. Current work includes organizing Cop Watch teams that deescalate, and observe police activities and organizing for justice with the families of people killed by the NYPD. Please pre-order our album, donate what you can and spread the word. Thank you!

<h3>Opera reimagined</h3>
<p>Join us as we explore Baroque opera as it was meant to be heard. This is an opera company unlike any other in the region :</p>
<ul>
<li>one that uses historical instruments and performance practice, as Handel and his contemporaries performed them.</li>
<li>opera that reflects the environment in which opera was created.</li>
<li>luscious and ornate music exquisitely played by a smaller ensemble, performed in an intimate setting where the audience can feel the story and drama of the opera in a new and exciting way.</li>
</ul>
<p>American Baroque Opera Company, based in Dallas, presents both familiar operas and rarely heard gems of the baroque, as fully staged productions, in an intimate style to educate new audiences about authentic early music performance practice. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Let's break down the operational, educational, and artistic elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presenting opera takes more than beautiful singers and sets. The orchestra, stage director, and backstage folks are professionals! Plus, planning a season takes coordination before the production and artistic staff, venues, and other arts organizations.</li>
<li>We are introducing this art to people new to opera or just tired of another Carmen! And. . .</li>
<li>We have partnered with several schools to create masterclasses and other educational opportunities.</li>
<li>School performances cost us, too.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This season, the American Baroque Opera Company debuts with an opera cabaret, designed to entice opera lovers to enjoy the music of Baroque composers and sample what ABOC can offer. In March, the Company will produce its first fully staged opera, Handel's masterpiece Alcina, in the Dallas Arts District. Eric and Miguel, along with co-founder Hillary Coyle, wish to present lush opera productions to a diverse audience, both current opera-goers and arts lovers who want to dip their toes into the cool, refreshing pool of Baroque masterworks. </p>
<ul>
<li>We love opera, and we hope to let you see how uplifting and exquisite it can be.</li>
<li>Our educational goals include teaching students about Baroque practice (which is seriously lacking in the music programs today) and providing free tickets to underserved youth.</li>
<li>Get in touch with us if you having questions about Baroque opera, ABOC, or our directors.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is getting the word out to North Texas audiences about the launch of our company. </p>
<ul>
<li>We could use your help in publicizing this funding campaign.</li>
<li>Talk to your friends and family about how they can be a part of ABOC.</li>

<p><b>Hey, I'm Shawna Ray.<i> Presently </i></b>is the name of a new song I wrote on a milestone <b>birthday,
April 30th</b> and the proposed name of this <b>new collaborative</b> EP - where you, the backer, have
a say on everything. Through surveys here on Indiegogo and Birthday Backer
voting, whether you support with $1 or up to $5,000 - <b>you become members of The
Ray Team, as if you are the record label.</b> So you get to help decide what songs
end up on the EP, and what the cover looks like. There are <b>corporate
sponsorship opportunities </b>at the highest levels and I would love
to work with you if you are interested
in those options. And in the end, the story will be ours to tell. You're not only the supporter
- you're the co-creator. So THANK YOU in advance for making this dream come true!!! </p>
<p>Five years after my OPEN album was
released, I have so many more songs I want to share while also seeking
publishers for my book, “Destination is the Journey,"" a memoir that shares the
stories behind these songs. Because of health issues and a major surgery
in 2010 and again in 2013, I never got to tour with OPEN album, so that is the
plan with this new venture, now that I am healthy and determined to turn my creative side into my career and tour with the Rhythm Ray band. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>I am asking for you to help me celebrate my birthday this
year through Indiegogo. This will be going out on my birthday, April 30th and ends May 17th. We hope to release the EP at a belated Birthday Bash concert on 7/11, July 11th, 2015. Everything from music to videos and concert planning –
it will all hopefully get funded with your help here on Indiegogo. As soon as this project gets funded, I plan to
start immediately. And whatever
you back, it will get you your reward and also a voice in the project. I can’t
wait to finally get this out! Thank you so much for your support! </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The risk and challenge is…I am but one woman and have
to outsource studio recording, CD duplication and such to other companies. So things beyond my
control could happen to cause delays - but know that I will move mountains
before I let a project fail. I will deliver. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>For those of you who have
already given so much and have a full plate of your own bills and goals, I totally understand if you are not able to give at all. Prayers and good vibes are free and also much appreciated. Also please share the links with your network or select contacts you feel might be interested in sponsoring. I have sponsored several projects, from $5 to $25 and friends and people I’ve ever met but believe in were able to publish books, make documentary films and record albums this way. So I am excited and getting over the uncomfortableness of asking for help. I truly appreciate your support, love and friendship. Thank you, for everything. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Breakdown of Costs</h3>
<p>Funds will be used to record 5 new songs on an EP and produce select videos to go on tour this summer. Of course you will get the <b>MUSIC </b>as well as some extra special things at each level detailed in the columns on the right side! </p>
<p>If I am able to go beyond my goal, the extended flex goal of $15,000 will allow me to record a full album and tour, here is the full breakdown of costs per items for studio,  producer, musicians, duplication, artwork, promotions…</p>
<p><b>Flex goal #1: $15,000 to record full album and tour</b></p>
<p>$300 - pays for mastering - this is important for it to sound good for radio.</p>
<p>$1000 – goes toward artwork design and photos which will be used for the CD, posters, website, and promotion. Having a ""brand image"" makes a big difference!</p>
<p>$1000 – goes to duplicating the CD's and packaging them so you get a signed copy</p>
<p>$1000 - will enable me to have an effective PR campaign for the album to get it to the ears of fans as well as pitching to industry folks (labels, management, booking, licensing for TV and Film)</p>
<p>$3000 - will be a great boost for touring, stage manager and submitting and traveling to festivals </p>
<p></p>
<p>$2500 – pays for the talented Rhythm Ray musicians who will play on the record</p>
<p>$2000 – goes toward making some visually and emotionally captivating music videos to go with the songs </p>
$5000 - pays the studio and producer to make the songs rock<br/><br/>

<p>With your help we can elevate our recording process to include industry professionals like MIKE FRASER (<b>AC/DC , METALLICA, AEROSMITH, BRYAN ADAMS</b>) and in studios where these same artists recorded some of their biggest hits.

</div></div>","Hey Friends!!

ONE BULLET DOWN is heading back into the studio to record a 6-song EP in the best studios and with the best people in the city and we need your help.  
We want to bring you a top quality recording that has the stamp of the city's finest producers, engineers and studios.  This recording will take the listener through a spectrum of music that has been misplaced in the modern day singles world.
With your help we can elevate our recording process to include industry professionals like MIKE FRASER (AC/DC , METALLICA, AEROSMITH, BRYAN ADAMS) and in studios where these same artists recorded some of their biggest hits. We want to release a record that stacks up against our heroes. 
Once complete, we feel the strength of this new material can compete in markets around the world, and we're going to take it there and we hope you'll be right there with us!

We have one-of-a-kind perks friends! Nowhere else will you find such 
unique rewards! We wanted to make sure we had something for everyone! 
See the individual perk videos for more info.

  What We Need & What You Get
Monies received will go directly to booking large room studio time, top engineer and production time as well as final mixing performed by some of the worlds best mix engineers. 
In this digital world, it's easy to record something on a laptop and share it online, but we feel to truly harness what makes a great song is to embody not only the songwriting, but the traditional recording process as well. 
To do this properly, we have set a goal of $15,000.  The largest portions of this figure are consumed by live room studio time and the final mixing process. 

The chart below defines the dollar allocations more precisely. 


In the event we don't achieve our intended goal, we will reduce the number of songs produced in these live rooms with these top level engineers.


  The Impact
For 15 years we have been recording and releasing records that were always just a little shy on quality. This time we want to ensure that no short cuts are taken with our songs and we will finally have the opportunity to produce a top quality product that rivals the best recordings around. 
We have narrowed down 6 songs that all have an individual perspective and unique character ranging from in-your-face rock to hip-hop. These songs will be our musical statement!


   Risks & Challenges
The music industry is ever changing and we always pride ourselves in being at the forefront of technology and changing trends. Our live show is a testament to this as it stands above any other independent act. We feel the first step in this evolving industry is to have a sonic masterpiece as the foundation on which to construct and grow your brand. 
We know the obstacles that face today's music industry but we truly believe that heart, passion and the soul that comes from real voices, instruments and sounds will always ring true to the listener.  We believe this is what will carry us and our brand across borders and to the next level. 

  Other Ways You Can Help
Despite all the obstacles we face, we hope that you find our goal and vision to pursue our dreams resonates as true for you as it does for us.

</div></div>","Hello everyone! Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign! I'm reaching out to you all for your support to help me record 3 new original electronic pieces and produce a new music video. I also plan to perform this new music at a live show next year in New York City.You may ask why I'm interested in creating electronic music after writing and performing on the saxophone and guitar after all these years? My interest was piqued about 10 years ago when I started using computer programs that taught me to write and record my own electronic music. Over the years while performing for audiences, I also continued to spend a significant amount of time revisiting and building on this new interest. I've become more and more excited about this new sound and am now ready for the production stage.To give you a better idea of what I intend to produce, I created a sample piece for you to enjoy at the end of the video.  I also included other music videos and pictures of some of the amazing experiences and performances that I've been involved in over the years, ones that have combined and acted as building blocks to create the musician I am today.I really hope that you will choose to join me on this creative journey and that the outcome will provide you with the same level of pleasure and excitement that I feel personally today.Thanks again for checking out my campaign and for all your support! I can't wait to begin!Best wishes to each and every one of you,Ross

Here is a pie chart of the proposed budget for this project:(Here's a video of a few performances I had this past year: playing a song with Ryan Miller(from the Band Guster), playing the national anthem in front of 4,900 Sky Sox fans before a game, and playing a show in NYC!) 

If I am unable to reach my goal, I will still go ahead with the project. The more money raised, the better the songs, music video and show will be. 
(Here's a video of me performing at the Garage School in Karachi, Pakistan.)



You may also help by sharing this campaign with your friends and family via e-mail or on social media. You can also follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @RossMintzerBand. I'm grateful for any support. 


Without you this project will not be possible. Your help and support will allow me to do something I love. I'm grateful and humble. If you contributed to this campaign, thank you. The music is as much yours as it is mine. 
(Here is a photo of me with students and family members before our first choir rehearsal in Karachi, Pakistan.)

<b>If we fall short</b> of raising $13,000 the money will be gifted directly to the family.

</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why? </h3> <p>Imagine you are a four year old; proud of your soldier dad and told your daddy was killed in a foreign country :</p> <ul> <li>No amount of money can replace Lily's Dad, Ashley's husband and the Lacey's son.  Still this fund professionally managed can <b>be a reminder</b> one day to a little-girl-grown-up <b>of the many people that wanted to show love to Lily and honor what her dad stood for. </b>
</li> <li>I think Gen. George Patton said it best, ""We should not cry that such men died, but we should rejoice that such men have lived.""  Still, this father cries.  For me it is as much the fathering component lost (I just walked my daughter down the aisle at her wedding) as the hero soldier piece for me.  </li>
<li>SFC Lacey served with my son Aubrey Hanson at Ft. Knox. My son's tour was in Iraq a few years earlier deployed from Ft. Carson (4th ID).  The joy of my son returning has the counter balance of sadness for the families whose sons did not return alive.  </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks</h3> <p> This is pretty low risk. Including producing the<b> Operation Lily song</b> (a rewrite of a 2010 song Hanson/Fritsch) I have spent about $500 of my own money preparing for this event. We are only offering materials that can be shipped immediately or within days.   </p> <ul> <li>In the past (pre-internet) I raised $10,000 for the Marc Muncy Family (a Columbus, Ohio Police Officer, Killed in the line of duty). This was done with press releases and a mention or two by Channel 10 on the evening news. People donated to an account at Bank One (Chase).  I have raised money for Autism, a 4 year old with cancer, and similar causes. Generally with me a father (or lack of a father) is a key component. </li>
<li>In 2005 I did a great deal of radio and TV and print to promote my book, Good Debt, Bad Debt (Penguin, 2005, 2007).  I hope to carry forward some of that experience in promoting Operation Lily and future SFL events. </li> <li>I don't under estimate how extremely difficult it will be to reach 1,000's of donors that will invest in this little girl.  We will need help from media and donors to spread the message. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul> <li>Please help us get word out and make some noise about Operation Lily.</li> <li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!

We are seeking help along with family, friends, and fellow citizens to:  Create a trust fund for SFC William ""Kelly"" Lacey's 4 year old daughter. 
As a father this is my chance (with you) to help SFC Lacey complete one last mission for his daughter.  
 A small amount will go to the Okaloosa County Veterans Memorial and the rest will go to trust for Lily's future. Except for CC fees and IndieGoGo fees, postage, etc, all funds will go to the trust.  
   What We Need & What You Get  We need to raise from $20,000 to $100,000 to have enough for to create the trust and select  an institutional trustee, SFL will not be the trustee.  Along with the Operation Lily song, a CD (or download .zip of the Operation Lily Album) will be sent to every person who supports Lily at the $10 or more level.  For $12 we will mail you the physical CD.    

 
We will ship your perks within a few days!

 
If we fall short of raising $13,000 the money will be gifted directly to the family. To create the trust and engage a bank trustee we feel like we need to raise $20,000 to $100,000.  We have an specialist attorney on standby for this purpose. They are donating their work for Operation Lily. 
    Why?  Imagine you are a four year old; proud of your soldier dad and told your daddy was killed in a foreign country :  No amount of money can replace Lily's Dad, Ashley's husband and the Lacey's son.  Still this fund professionally managed can be a reminder one day to a little-girl-grown-up of the many people that wanted to show love to Lily and honor what her dad stood for. 
 I think Gen. George Patton said it best, ""We should not cry that such men died, but we should rejoice that such men have lived.""  Still, this father cries.  For me it is as much the fathering component lost (I just walked my daughter down the aisle at her wedding) as the hero soldier piece for me.  
SFC Lacey served with my son Aubrey Hanson at Ft. Knox. My son's tour was in Iraq a few years earlier deployed from Ft. Carson (4th ID).  The joy of my son returning has the counter balance of sadness for the families whose sons did not return alive.      Risks  This is pretty low risk. Including producing the Operation Lily song (a rewrite of a 2010 song Hanson/Fritsch) I have spent about $500 of my own money preparing for this event. We are only offering materials that can be shipped immediately or within days.     In the past (pre-internet) I raised $10,000 for the Marc Muncy Family (a Columbus, Ohio Police Officer, Killed in the line of duty). This was done with press releases and a mention or two by Channel 10 on the evening news. People donated to an account at Bank One (Chase).  I have raised money for Autism, a 4 year old with cancer, and similar causes. Generally with me a father (or lack of a father) is a key component. 
In 2005 I did a great deal of radio and TV and print to promote my book, Good Debt, Bad Debt (Penguin, 2005, 2007).  I hope to carry forward some of that experience in promoting Operation Lily and future SFL events.  I don't under estimate how extremely difficult it will be to reach 1,000's of donors that will invest in this little girl.  We will need help from media and donors to spread the message.     Other Ways You Can Help  Please help us get word out and make some noise about Operation Lily.

http://www.intersectionmusic.org/advocacy.htmlAbout Intersection
Intersection was born from Kelly Corcoran’s desire to bring a professional contemporary music ensemble to Nashville. Over the past year, that vision has become reality.  We have expanded the musical language of Nashville by focusing on repertoire from the 20th and 21st centuries for both adult and family audiences. As a non-profit organization, we rely on the generosity of our community to help make this vision a reality, and we cannot do so without your help. A donation to Intersection is a contribution to the thriving contemporary music scene growing in Nashville, and helping fund our upcoming year will help create a vibrant season you won’t want to miss.
The time is now for Nashville.  Nashville is clearly growing and considered a music center, compared to New York, Los Angeles and London.  While our music scene is diverse and thriving, Nashville is lacking an eco-system dedicated to the performance, creation and cultivation of contemporary classical music.  Intersection is the first professional ensemble in Nashville presenting this new music in a non-traditional way, truly breaking down boundaries with explorative, avant-garde contemporary music programming geared for audiences of varying ages.   Contemporary music is a vital piece of a truly diverse, thriving music city.  

What We Need & What You Get
We aim to raise $15,000 to compensate our musicians and artists for our October performance - Sea of Tonality.    This program includes 19 musicians.    The $15,000 covers their compensation for all rehearsals and the performance as well as support to bring Julia Wolfe, Pulitzer Prize winning composer, here to Nashville for the performance and rehearsals.

That is fantastic!   Our budget this season is $110,000 and we are hoping to raise $42,000 from Individual supporters like you!    Any funds gained through this campaign beyond our goal will go towards our budget  for season 2. 

The Impact
A donation to Intersection will help keep contemporary music at the forefront of Nashville’s music conversation, and our first season is a material example of our work in action. These performances provided a speaker box for 20th and 21st century composers as well as others in the local arts community. Collaborating with groups including New Dialect and Zeitgeist Gallery, Intersection took the best in local dance and visual art to magnify the importance of all contemporary art.  Nashville Scene, The Tennessean, Nashville Arts and WPLN, among others, all praised intersection’s dive into unfamiliar territories, further proving Nashville’s readiness to embrace such an ensemble.We will also dedicate half of our programming to families and younger audiences.  We are passionate about introducing children to contemporary music and are dedicated to building a robust eco-system for contemporary classical music in Nashville and beyond. 
Risks & Challenges
We need you to share the message that contemporary classical music has value and that we need Intersection in Nashville.    We must accurately compensate musicians, artists, composers and collaborators for their expertise and as a result we do have a sizable amount of funds to raise.   Intersection aims to be presenting art and performance of value and intention.    We hope you will join us on this journey.   Without financial support, Intersection will not be able to fulfill it's mission.    We are actively pursuing all sources of income and are hitting the streets talking to many about Intersection, but we cannot move forward presenting programs until we have our funds secured.

Although we hope you will donate to Intersection and our second season, there are many ways to help other than financial support. If you know people who may be interested in Intersection’s mission, please share this page with them. Word of mouth is still one of the most effective tools for promotion, and we cannot succeed in showing this campaign to everyone without your help! Indiegogo has created very effective sharing tools that can be found on this page, and we hope you will take a moment to use them to spread the word to those in your life who also understand the importance of contemporary music in Nashville.Explore our website at www.intersectionmusic.org

If you are interested in volunteering or supporting Intersection in some other way,  please contact us at intersection@intersectionmusic.org

I sincerely hope that it moves you.  I also hope that you'd like to be part of this journey with me!</p><p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise money needed to record my Nashville album.</p><p><strong>The Campaign Pitch</strong></p><p>Hi there,</p><p>The purpose of this campaign is to gain your support for helping me record my new songs.  I truly hope that you will consider in joining me for a musical adventure ride that is bound to inspire, excite and provide you with real life experience of the music industry, through my journey!  </p><p>My songs are written and just waiting to come to life in the studio, with your support.  Initial recordings of my new songs are already getting airplay - with very positive comments on the CBC and BBC (who were embarrassingly glowing in their review.)  </p><p>It would be so amazing if you would participate in this quest, and help me produce and release this new collection of my reflective and uplifting original songs.  If you enjoy some of the attached pieces and believe in Indie Artists, do come on board!  .</p><p><strong>A little bit about me</strong></p><p>My name is Annie. I am a singer, songwriter, vocal coach, performer and occasional spiritual guide (or so I've been told). My father is a musician, my mother, a music teacher.  I was so fortunate to be part of a musical family of seven children. I was singing before I could talk, playing the piano since I was six years old.  I wrote my first song at the age of eight. </p><p>I perform live around the beautiful city of Toronto with some of the most lovely and talented people in town.  I am very grateful to have to have the opportunity to perform my songs every week at a wonderful venue in downtown Toronto (120 Diner), in addition to other professional gigs around the city.  I also compose music for film as well as jingles for commercials.</p><p>I know that I am SO blessed that I get to do what I love through music, through voice and through serving others.  </p><p>Music brings me so much joy and, at times, it has brought a lot of pain too. Rediscovery of many aspects of one’s self can be found in a song, a poem and a melody. I want share the message of hope, love and kindness that come my way through music. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What I'm trying to achieve</strong></p><p>I was extremely fortunate to have met an amazing producer while in Nashville recently. His name is Fred Mollin.  Fred has tremendous success developing and recording artists such as Billie Joel, Dan Hill and many more.   We met for a coffee while I was there – after which, I insisted on singing Fred five original songs – all in the parking lot of the coffee shop!  Now, Fred is willing to take a chance on me and has agreed to produce and record my music.   However, I do have to pay for studio time an orchestra, arranger, cd's, art, engineers etc for this to happen - I sincerely hope that you will take a chance on me too!   </p><p>While my main goal is to record an album in Nashville with Fred, I am also currently completing an album that I had already started.  As well, when that is completed, I have so many songs written and ready for production I want to record one more album. </p><p>I know that this is ambitious but I know with all my heart that my sole purpose in life is to create music that will inspire others.  Music that will encourage and empower you to feel deeply, to honor and respect all people, so that we all may live in harmony.</p><p><strong>The story behind my music</strong></p><p>Tragedy struck my family on three occasions. By the age of 14, I had lost three brothers. The aftermath basically paved my path for me. My parents did the best that they could and although I lived in their shadow of darkness and pain for much of my life, I was a seemingly happy person, yet I carried with me an underlying sadness and the worry that the worst can happen at any time. Growing up I poured my soul into music, but I found myself floundering and felt like I was floating through life.  At that time, the music I was writing was intense and based on loss (sometimes it still is).   </p><p>Four years ago, I pulled out an old song, written years before. It was a cry for help. A prayer and a plea. At 3AM one morning, I sat at my piano with tears streaming down my face, begging to be heard. I was desperate to feel again, for God or the universe or whatever is out there that is bigger than us, to help me. </p><p>I felt like, somehow, my prayers were answered.  I looked for, and found the signs that I was ready for my life to change.  I started to notice some crazy things in my physical reality, this was constant and I felt like I was in the twilight zone. One of my students urged me to open myself up to new possibilities, to meditate and awaken myself to new experiences and insights and open myself to a new spiritual reality.  This has become profoundly true for me - I had reached the darkest stage of my life - only once I had given up, surrendered myself, did I start to wake up. (Side note: I will try to keep this short and will be creating a video blog at some point to explain further.) </p><p>Ever since this started happening, my perspective has changed.  Wonderful things have been happening. I discovered meditation and how to heal from the past and escape the thoughts.  The music I am now writing feels as though it is divinely inspired at times. I have big dreams to share this music that I hope many will enjoy and find helpful.  There is a clear message about love and kindness. With every part of me, I know that my sole purpose is to inspire others with this music and hopefully encourage people to appreciate those around them.    </p><p>Please know that your contribution will go towards something good - something pure - and that you will be helping to seed a positive message that can help a lot of people.</p><p><strong>The album costs</strong></p><p>I have to raise $26,835 for the Nashville album plus an additional $10,000 to help me with my other two albums.  I'd also love to get some records of my very recent release of 'Be Careful What You Wish For'   I know I have a huge goal but I have dreams to help inspire others with music and I'm hoping that you may want to help too! I have no idea if I'm capable of raising that much money but I'm going to try! Hopefully with your help.  </p><p>If I exceed my goal, this would give me a larger budget to work.  I would use this money to go towards marketing and the production of the albums and hopefully vinyl records too.</p><p><strong>What you get in return </strong></p><p>There are some great perks available to contributors.   </p><p>1. The chance to be a part of something very special and inspirational.</p><p>2. We can write a song together, well... you come up with the poem or lyrical content and I turn it into song. What a great gift for a loved one or just for yourself!  </p><p>3. Handwritten lyrics</p><p>4. Singing lessons with me</p><p>5.

Help me make some noise about this. Tell your friends and help spread the word.  </p><p>If you are able, come and see me play! I am grateful to get to live my purpose and would love for you to be a part of it.</p><p>Suggest a perk you'd like to see me offer! The campaign is a morphing, collective effort, just like the music.</p><p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p><p>1. Making a record in Nashville requires a lot of help. Fred will have a musical arranger on the project. The money will also go towards paying an orchestra and some of the best musicians in Nashville. Produced by Fred Mollin. Mixing/Mastering.</p><p>2.  Production of CD's.</p><p>3.  The two albums I'm currently working on. I have started one but there is so much more recording and mixing to be done. This has very much been a DIY project which has taken SO long.  It would be wonderful to be able to book an engineer and not have to worry about how I'm going to pay for it. Once again, there would be mastering costs, musician costs, engineering costs, production of CDs, marketing.  </p><p>I do have some stretch goals which, at the moment, seem impossible but... I'm going to go for it anyway. If I happen to make the goal, I may keep this campaign open a little longer in order to try to achieve bigger budget for all three projects. While I would also love to be able to put the music onto a physical record, this is more expensive than producing a CD. I also hope to engage press and other PR channels to get my music out to be heard.  Hopefully I would even be able to go out on the road and bring this music to you wherever you are!   </p><p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p><p>Of course, there are risks involved in this. I really hope you decide to take a chance and come along for the ride. I am strong, I am determined.  I will keep working my butt off to get this music out there. Let's do this together!</p><p>The risks and challenges are few.  Distribution of Vinyl takes time, but offering downloads of the albums and individual songs is both quick and efficient.  By offering these two channels - vinyl and downloads only - we can both save on costs and stay on schedule.  The songs are done and already sound so great – As mentioned the advance tracks I've sent in have been getting attention and airplay from CBC in addition to BBC. It’s now time to get these records done.</p><p>Your help with this final push gives you gives us the ability to put it all out expediently, to strike while the iron is hot, so to speak.  You will also then have the ‘bragging rights” that you helped to bring these songs into the world. </p><p><strong>And finally, thank you.</strong></p><p>This record needs you and I need you too! Your donation, link sharing, word of mouth, as well as your love and support all go into making this a collective effort to put the songs where they belong - in your ears and out in the world! Thank you in advance for your support! </p><p>The way music makes it out into the world is changing. The landscape is shifting as we speak. Crowdfunding is a powerful and important tool for independent artists of all mediums. Your support is a thumbs-up contribution to a movement as well as a stake in a record that would not be possible without a community. Thank you for joining that loving and supportive community.</p></div>","Hi friends and fans!Thanks so much for taking the time to watch my campaign video!

Help me make some noise about this. Tell your friends and help spread the word.  If you are able, come and see me play! I am grateful to get to live my purpose and would love for you to be a part of it.Suggest a perk you'd like to see me offer! The campaign is a morphing, collective effort, just like the music.Where will the money go?1. Making a record in Nashville requires a lot of help. Fred will have a musical arranger on the project. The money will also go towards paying an orchestra and some of the best musicians in Nashville. Produced by Fred Mollin. Mixing/Mastering.2.  Production of CD's.3.  The two albums I'm currently working on. I have started one but there is so much more recording and mixing to be done. This has very much been a DIY project which has taken SO long.  It would be wonderful to be able to book an engineer and not have to worry about how I'm going to pay for it. Once again, there would be mastering costs, musician costs, engineering costs, production of CDs, marketing.  I do have some stretch goals which, at the moment, seem impossible but... I'm going to go for it anyway. If I happen to make the goal, I may keep this campaign open a little longer in order to try to achieve bigger budget for all three projects. While I would also love to be able to put the music onto a physical record, this is more expensive than producing a CD. I also hope to engage press and other PR channels to get my music out to be heard.  Hopefully I would even be able to go out on the road and bring this music to you wherever you are!   Risks and challengesOf course, there are risks involved in this. I really hope you decide to take a chance and come along for the ride. I am strong, I am determined.  I will keep working my butt off to get this music out there. Let's do this together!The risks and challenges are few.  Distribution of Vinyl takes time, but offering downloads of the albums and individual songs is both quick and efficient.  By offering these two channels - vinyl and downloads only - we can both save on costs and stay on schedule.  The songs are done and already sound so great – As mentioned the advance tracks I've sent in have been getting attention and airplay from CBC in addition to BBC. It’s now time to get these records done.Your help with this final push gives you gives us the ability to put it all out expediently, to strike while the iron is hot, so to speak.  You will also then have the ‘bragging rights” that you helped to bring these songs into the world. And finally, thank you.This record needs you and I need you too! Your donation, link sharing, word of mouth, as well as your love and support all go into making this a collective effort to put the songs where they belong - in your ears and out in the world! Thank you in advance for your support! The way music makes it out into the world is changing. The landscape is shifting as we speak. Crowdfunding is a powerful and important tool for independent artists of all mediums. Your support is a thumbs-up contribution to a movement as well as a stake in a record that would not be possible without a community. Thank you for joining that loving and supportive community.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I am Ryne Meadow, a twenty-two year old dream pop singer/songwriter from rural North Georgia. </p>
<p>This year has been huge for me so far! For starters, I packed up everything I owned and moved across the country to the NYC area with the intention of finding my place in the music industry. Somewhere in the midst of packing up my old family home and playing several farewell gigs with all of my new gear, I finished thirteen demos, sent them off to twenty or so labels, and hoped for the best. I told myself <b>""Ryne, if you don't hear back from anyone in the next three months, you're gonna have to suck it up and do this on your own."" </b></p>
<p><b>  </b>... and that, dear reader, is how we got to this little campaign.</p>
<p>Let's backtrack a little, though, so you can fully understand the importance of this album to me. To be completely honest, these songs are not ""new."" All of them were written a good four to five years ago in my little bedroom, with only a teddy frog and a cat for an audience. They hold the biggest place in my heart, because they're not the same songs they were five years ago. They've grown so much, twisting and shaping into entities that I never imagined possible, much like the man I've become. That's so beautiful to me. Each song captures a specific moment(s) in my life and I'm instantly taken aback every time I hear/play/share them. <b>This isn't just an album to me, it's a story, a work of art.</b></p>
<p>By opening up your heart and donating to my album, you'll be helping me share with the world the tale I've been dying to tell.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need From You &amp; What You'll Get From Me</h3> <p>Although I'm doing this record on my own, creatively speaking, it doesn't come without a cost. <b>In order to fully fund the making of this record, I'm asking for $5,000. </b>Almost half of this budget will go towards mixing and mastering of the tracks themselves. </p>
<p>Mixing will be done by the incredible Matt Tamisan at Japanski Studios in Athens, Ga. Basically, I record each song in my bedroom at home. I then bring the parts to Matt in the studio. We'll scrap the fake piano I've tracked and record live piano using the upright on site. We add vocals and little tid-bits here and there, but we mainly focus on mixing. </p>
<p>The rest of the budget will cover the cost of making merchandise (i.e. CD Production, Screenprinting T-Shirts, Shipping your perks, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Speaking of Perks, let me tell you about some of the goodies I have to offer you! </b>Aside from the typical things like physical cd's and screen printed t-shirts, I've come up with some unique things that make you feel more connected to me. </p> <ul> <li>Starting off simple, you can get exclusive instrumentals of each song on the album. These will ONLY be available through this campaign and they are limited.</li>
<li>I'll be teaming up with friend and amazingly talented fashion designer Laria NYC to make a limited number of custom, hand embroidered t-shirts for your wearing pleasures.</li>
<li>If you know me personally (some of you may not and that's SO okay), you know that I needle felt, because I'm an old cat lady. Needle Felted Brooches and Bags are up for grabs!</li>
<li>Want your own private concert? I am offering house shows/webcam shows to very generous donors! </li>
<li>If you're in the Athens, Ga. area in the time of finishing the record, you could spend a day in the studio with Matt and I.<br/>
</li>
<li>Are you musically inclined and love to perform on stage? You could have the chance to come onstage with me!</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
</div><b>... and the list goes on! You'll also receive written/video updates from me on the regular. You'll be the first to see exclusive studio diaries, album progress updates, and receive important </b><b>information (album title, artwork, show schedules, perk production, etc.). </b><div>
<b><br/></b><div>Now, of course, I'm running the risk of not fully meeting my goal. That's scary and makes me a bit anxious, of course. If that's to happen, I may have to hold back on some of the merchandise. For example, I may have to limit the amount of t-shirts or posters I have printed. However, we're going to remain positive. If something of that nature happens, we'll deal with it together and I'll think of other prizes to make up for the things being sacrificed. Regardless of whether the goal is met or not, <b>I WILL be making this album! </b>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This campaign will last a total of 60 days, which seems like a long time. During those two months, I will be working to finalize each song prepare it for mixing. As of right now, two songs have been mixed, seven have been finalized, and four require more work. It may not seem like a lot of work, but it definitely is.</p>
<p>If you're to contribute to my campaign, it would give me the push that I need to finish everything before I enter the studio again in November. Though I'm doing the record to share my story, it always helps to know that people are listening. <b>It</b><b>'s always made me nervous to be vulnerable, but having your support wo</b><b>uld be incredibly humbling and inspire me to be transparent. These are the rawest emotions that I'll be sharing with you. It already feels like a weight is being lifted off of my shoulders just by writing this.</b> </p>
<p>This album, to me, is like no other. It takes a step in a different direction than what's so popular in music today. I wanted to create something uniquely my own, but, also, something incredibly relatable. I whole-heartedly believe that I've done that.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I've already faced some challenges with making this record. The number one challenge, of course, was getting out of the mindset of ""you can fund this on your own, you don't need help."" Realistically, I can't fund this album on my own in the timeframe I have, which was hard for me to accept. <b>I'm a very independent person and it took quite a long while for me to be comfortable with asking for help.</b></p>
<p>More recently, however, I've ran into traveling issues. Since I'm making the record back in Georgia, I have to travel from New Jersey to meet with Matt in the studio. As you all know, traveling isn't cheap and I've come to realize that my trip to Georgia in September simply cannot happen as of right now. It made me a bit upset when I realized this, but it also pushed me to work harder at making this happen. I WILL be returning to the studio in November. If the record isn't finished in that trip, it will be finished soon after. <b>The album will be out NO LATER than March of 2016!</b></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>There are so many ways you can help me with this! Funding is vital, of course, but word of mouth is just as important.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to use the Indiegogo share tools to spread my little campaign all over social media. The more noise we make, the more buzz we'll get! Let's make some noise!</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding this campaign, please contact me!</p>
<p>And if you've read this whole spiel, I love you. It means so much that you've taken time out of your day to devote to my art.</p>

the Burden of a Lullaby Music Video & New EP – Project by 



Equator & FilmsbyFine









“ Like
the Burden of a Lullaby “  which is combine
with one of the Japanese traditional singing style called “ Shigin
- Ginyu ( Waka ) “ with electronica sound.

日本の伝統的な歌唱法、詩吟の歌い手とアンビエント- エレクトロニカサウンドのコラボレーションによる楽曲 Like the burden of a Lullaby ミュージックビデオプロジェクト


The
traditional Japanese Singer Ms. Kyoko Sato who I have met her about
10 years ago in front of swimming
pool near my place.
When
I heard her singing first time I felt so much of the energy from her
as a human being and I really
moved !!!
It's
very soulful and amazing, I can't explain how
it is that well but I was really impressed so I asked her to make a
song together and we made it.
約10年前偶然知りあった詩吟の歌い手 Sato さんの唄に今迄、それ程日本の伝統芸能に心動かされなかった自分の気持ちを一心させられ一緒に曲を作ろうとお願いし実現した曲です。


She
had cancer at that time I suppose it makes her more soulful singer.
当時、癌との闘病生活をしていた状況がSato さんを更にソウルフルな唄い手にした。

Afterwards
we released EP with the song in 2006 and it became one of the most
unique song of our originals.
 2006年 -  Like the burden of a lullabyを含むEPをCD Babyからリリース。

We
have been promoting our songs mainly with radio stations
internationally and since last year 2014
we started promote our songs in “ Jango radio “ 
and we realized
that the song “ Like the burden
of a lullaby “ is still popular and people like it !! And we also
still like it very much.
So
we decided to make a Music video of the song and we can dedicate to
her and tell the music lovers through the video that this is ""  The New Japanese Ambient Pop tune"" And for that   we need
your support !!!!

However, there is evidence of a French viol school as early as 1529 at the court of King Francis I, with the first French treatise for viol published in 1589 by Claude Gervaise, as well as manifold iconographical sources. This early French viol school utilized instruments with five strings tuned in fourths throughout (none of which are extant), differing from those used in the contemporary Italian school and later French school, both of whom tuned their viols in a mixture of fourths and a major third, identical to lute practice. The French Consort Project, founded in Cleveland, Ohio by scholar-performer John Romey, intends to reconstruct a consort of these uniquely designed viols from the French Renaissance by utilizing all available established historical sources from treatises and iconography, and for the first time, identifying possible repertoire.<br/><br/>After a close collaboration with renowned luthier John Pringle that resulted in successfully reconstructing the largest-size rebec from Agricola’s consort of rebecs, the decision was made to form an ensemble consisting of some of the most promising young viol players available with interest in this unique project, procure funding for reconstruction of a four-viol French Renaissance consort, and begin to plan performances in major cities and universities across the Midwest and Northeast. The project currently hopes to pique the interest and gain the affiliation of more performers, which would enable concert tours and provide constant tactile input from different perspectives.<br/><br/>There are several goals contained within this reconstruction project: first, to create a dialogue between a knowledgeable and experienced luthier who is interested in experimentation and open-minded performers capable of providing useful feedback in regards to what “works” and what “doesn’t work”; second, to utilize the results of this dialogue, combined with surviving historical documentation, to learn what we as modern musicians can derive about performance practices from an era that has yielded no extant instruments; third, to ultimately revive rarely-performed repertoire by important French composers of the sixteenth-century, for the first time performed on the instruments modeled on those that were available in France at the time of composition; fourth, to present the results at academic conferences, create a series of educational lecture-concerts for the general public, and ultimately publish results in peer-reviewed academic journals.<br/><br/>John Romey has already delivered the fruits of this research at academic conferences. The papers examine the historical evidence of the early French viol consort, with particular emphasis on examining extant treatises dealing with instrumental technique and surviving iconographical sources, and reveals that the fantasies of Eustache du Caurroy (1610) and Claude Le Jeune (1612) could have been performed by a consort of these five-stringed early French viols. Methodologies employed to make this determination include examining the clef and range distribution in a variety of instrumental fantasies and comparing this data to the tunings and ranges provided in contemporary French treatises as well as examining the construction and relative sizes of the instruments present in iconography.<br/><br/>In 2013 John Pringle completed a prototype for the first viol in the consort (see the gallery for images of the prototype!), and it has gone through extensive testing. Over the past year, Mr. Romey has carried out archival research in France as a Fulbright Scholar and devoted time in the archives to The French Consort Project.

<p>Hello! I’m <b>T.E. Yates</b>. Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign!</p>
<p>Here’s a little about me and what I do. I am a <b>singer-songwriter</b>, <b>musician</b>, <b>artist</b> and <b>animator</b>. I play guitar, harmonica, mandolin, banjo, ukulele and musical saw. I sing and I write songs.</p>

I’m inspired by a huge amount of music covering an eclectic range of styles and genres and I hope that this diversity is apparent in my songwriting.<br/><br/>I also draw, paint and animate. I'm pleased to say that my first completed animated work ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMxF7LQ4weA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Evil Cat</a>"" was shortlisted for Best Music Video at the 2016 British Animation Awards.<br/><br/>
<h3>About the Album<br/>
</h3>
My band and I are ready to embark upon the recording of my first full length studio album, titled ""Silver Coins and White Feathers"". This will be my biggest and most ambitious project to date and I’d like to offer you the opportunity to firstly help make this record possible and secondly to ensure that its release is a success.<br/><br/>This album will be a follow up to my debut release, 2013’s ""<a href=""https://teyates.bandcamp.com/album/possessed-ep"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Possessed EP</a>"". Once again the record will be released and distributed through Manchester label <b><a href=""http://www.debtrecords.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Debt Records</a></b>.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455665247/gwsqlgg36rr3triomg0e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
My band, who are a bunch of highly accomplished and thoroughly professional musicians, have dedicated a great deal of time in order to learn and rehearse the material which we’re going to record during the album sessions.<br/><br/>Whilst plenty of new material will be included on the album, some of the songs we plan to record have been staples of my live set for a long time. It’ll be wonderful to be able to finally commit these songs to record, including ""Burning Bungalow"", ""Mystery Window"" and ""Orion's Belt"".<br/><br/><p></p>

Hello! I’m T.E. Yates. Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign!
Here’s a little about me and what I do. I am a singer-songwriter, musician, artist and animator. I play guitar, harmonica, mandolin, banjo, ukulele and musical saw. I sing and I write songs.

I’m inspired by a huge amount of music covering an eclectic range of styles and genres and I hope that this diversity is apparent in my songwriting.I also draw, paint and animate. I'm pleased to say that my first completed animated work ""Evil Cat"" was shortlisted for Best Music Video at the 2016 British Animation Awards.
About the Album

Since all those who are for world peace would obviously say yes, the only thing left to be done is finance, launch and continuously develop this very campaign which invites humanity to consider and respond to these agreements while simultaneously illustrating the implications of unity around them. <br/><br/>The very exploration of this campaign in and of itself is the peer review process for validating the implications of this formula.  By reading these very words, you are participating in the peer review.  And so, if you would in fact like to see all those who are for world peace unite around the agreements presented in this campaign, we invite you to simply invite everyone you know to respond.<br/>By supporting this campaign you help insure that the formula is presented to as many people as possible, so as to be verified as an irrefutable solution for world peace.</p><p>All Initial funds will be used to bring together a team of visionaries (first a global team and then regional teams) who will develop the campaign so as to make it infinitely more digestible, while facilitating the dialogue which follows. At the end of this first 3 month development process we will host a 1 week World Peace Disclosure Summit which unites local and international key thought leaders in all related fields as an ideal live peer review and celebration of everything presented here. This will become a monthly summit held simultaneously in every major city.</p><p><strong>Achieving World Peace and All 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:</strong><br/>These Agreements represent an open source research curriculum know as <strong>""The Science of World Peace"" </strong>which will be engaged with and plugged into all corporations, organizations and educational, political and religious institutions so as to educate on and facilitate consensus reality perspectives as unanimously agreed upon action plans for peace.<br/>The World Peace Disclosure Summit will highlight humanity’s most voted up responses to each agreement.<br/><br/>Soon The Realization That All Of The Solutions To Humanity's Most Pressing Issues Already Exist Will Be Absolutely and Irrefutably Obvious To Everyone .<br/><br/>Unity through Simplicity equals  Critical Mass and The Tipping Point to that Realization.</p><p>This Formula is an immediate pathway to illuminating all the solutions and then financing all the  visionaries who advocate and pioneer them. Through the spontaneous unification &amp; mobilization of humanity around the greatest and most obvious agreements, we <strong>Wage World Peace. </strong></p><p>The first phase of this campaign simply invites humanity to support unification around the basic exploration of these key agreements. Once unity has been achieved around these irrefusable agreements, the second phase invites everyone to nominate, vote up, illustrate and actualize all other greatest agreements which unity can be leveraged towards.<br/>Humanity's First Unanimous Peace Agreement Is The Greatest Unanimous Peace Agreement, As It Unveils The Infinite Leverage of Unified Intent.</p><p><br/>That being said, the <strong>First</strong> of these Five Agreements is <strong>The Greatest Agreement Humanity Could and Would make</strong>; and because it is absolutely <strong>Irrefusable</strong>, it becomes the <strong>Ultimate Litmus Test of Truth</strong> which will initially divide Humanity into two categories:<br/><strong>1.</strong> Those who say yes.<br/><strong>2.</strong> Those who have yet to say yes.</p><p><strong>* The Implications of this Statement may take a while to be fully recognized.</strong><br/>This is Judgement Day, and you are the judge and the judged.<br/><br/>The moment 144,000 angel philanthropists have simply said YES to even the first of these agreements, we will have the attention of all those who are for world peace. </p><p>What could be more powerful, on a tangible and actionable level other than all those who are for peace and unity standing in solidarity around a single agreement, recognizing that unity around the first agreement guarantees unity around the rest? <br/><br/>This first phase of unity will insure the response from all the most prominent Humanitarians, First Nations Elders, Philanthropic Billionaires, Nobel Peace Prize Laureates and World Leaders.  <strong>It's time for all those who are for peace and unity TO UNITE. </strong></p><p>This is about the formation of the greatest Global Super-Movement in human history.  <br/>These Five Greatest Agreements actualize a collective commons revolving around circular and solidarity, resource based economics.  This involves the highest level of transparency, accountability, open collaboration which humanity can fathom.  From decentralized global self-governance systems, to the holistic and sustainable stewardship of Earth’s resources around natural law and indigenous and traditional stewardship methodologies.<br/><br/>Imagine a database of shared intelligence involving open source blueprints and tested solutions for the creation of thriving eco-communities everywhere.</p><p><strong>OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING.</strong><br/>These agreements instigate the Cooperative 5th Industrial Revolution which happens through the cooperative acquisition of all major industries via the leverage of solidarity in purchasing power.<br/><br/><strong>Put Simply: </strong><br/>These agreements represent the liberation, emancipation, collective-self realization and Collective-Self Actualization of Humanity.  :) <br/>We invite you to take a pause and really feel these words.<br/>Are you open to the possibility that this is true, and that what you are about to finish reading is exactly that.  Lets us repeat it.<br/><strong><i>These agreements represent the liberation, emancipation, collective-self realization and Collective Self-Actualization of Humanity.  :) </i></strong><br/><strong>In Essence, this is about the Flowering of Human Consciousness.</strong></p><p>*Below the 3rd Agreement we also introduce a technological breakthrough in the form of a new and abundant, 100% sustainable natural resource which not only replaces almost everything made from plastic, fiberglass and wood, but also represents an ideal medium for a global solidarity economy which templates how a collective commons can holistically and sustainably steward all of Earths resources.

This could be done by cooperatively acquiring a global hemp seed company or forming a new company.  In any case, this single agreement literally forms the largest hemp company in the world.  This would obviously be horizontally and vertically integrated, meaning we would cooperatively own all the hemp farms (through land stewardship), and use the entire hemp plant to make zeoform, clothing, and everything else that hemp can be used for.  Consider that when 1 billion people have united, by simply agreeing to purchase one shirt from our own company, we form the most successful clothing company literally over night.  The only monopoly that should exist is the one which all of humanity owns equally.   This obviously leads to humanity forming solidarity economics around telecommunications, sustainable energy, salt, water, and generally everything related to society.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>What is The Fourth Greatest Yes or No Agreement?</strong></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">

Since all those who are for world peace would obviously say yes, the only thing left to be done is finance, launch and continuously develop this very campaign which invites humanity to consider and respond to these agreements while simultaneously illustrating the implications of unity around them. The very exploration of this campaign in and of itself is the peer review process for validating the implications of this formula.  By reading these very words, you are participating in the peer review.  And so, if you would in fact like to see all those who are for world peace unite around the agreements presented in this campaign, we invite you to simply invite everyone you know to respond.By supporting this campaign you help insure that the formula is presented to as many people as possible, so as to be verified as an irrefutable solution for world peace.All Initial funds will be used to bring together a team of visionaries (first a global team and then regional teams) who will develop the campaign so as to make it infinitely more digestible, while facilitating the dialogue which follows. At the end of this first 3 month development process we will host a 1 week World Peace Disclosure Summit which unites local and international key thought leaders in all related fields as an ideal live peer review and celebration of everything presented here. This will become a monthly summit held simultaneously in every major city.Achieving World Peace and All 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:These Agreements represent an open source research curriculum know as ""The Science of World Peace"" which will be engaged with and plugged into all corporations, organizations and educational, political and religious institutions so as to educate on and facilitate consensus reality perspectives as unanimously agreed upon action plans for peace.The World Peace Disclosure Summit will highlight humanity’s most voted up responses to each agreement.Soon The Realization That All Of The Solutions To Humanity's Most Pressing Issues Already Exist Will Be Absolutely and Irrefutably Obvious To Everyone .Unity through Simplicity equals  Critical Mass and The Tipping Point to that Realization.This Formula is an immediate pathway to illuminating all the solutions and then financing all the  visionaries who advocate and pioneer them. Through the spontaneous unification & mobilization of humanity around the greatest and most obvious agreements, we Wage World Peace. The first phase of this campaign simply invites humanity to support unification around the basic exploration of these key agreements. Once unity has been achieved around these irrefusable agreements, the second phase invites everyone to nominate, vote up, illustrate and actualize all other greatest agreements which unity can be leveraged towards.Humanity's First Unanimous Peace Agreement Is The Greatest Unanimous Peace Agreement, As It Unveils The Infinite Leverage of Unified Intent.That being said, the First of these Five Agreements is The Greatest Agreement Humanity Could and Would make; and because it is absolutely Irrefusable, it becomes the Ultimate Litmus Test of Truth which will initially divide Humanity into two categories:1. Those who say yes.2. Those who have yet to say yes.* The Implications of this Statement may take a while to be fully recognized.This is Judgement Day, and you are the judge and the judged.The moment 144,000 angel philanthropists have simply said YES to even the first of these agreements, we will have the attention of all those who are for world peace. What could be more powerful, on a tangible and actionable level other than all those who are for peace and unity standing in solidarity around a single agreement, recognizing that unity around the first agreement guarantees unity around the rest? This first phase of unity will insure the response from all the most prominent Humanitarians, First Nations Elders, Philanthropic Billionaires, Nobel Peace Prize Laureates and World Leaders.  It's time for all those who are for peace and unity TO UNITE. This is about the formation of the greatest Global Super-Movement in human history.  These Five Greatest Agreements actualize a collective commons revolving around circular and solidarity, resource based economics.  This involves the highest level of transparency, accountability, open collaboration which humanity can fathom.  From decentralized global self-governance systems, to the holistic and sustainable stewardship of Earth’s resources around natural law and indigenous and traditional stewardship methodologies.Imagine a database of shared intelligence involving open source blueprints and tested solutions for the creation of thriving eco-communities everywhere.OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING.These agreements instigate the Cooperative 5th Industrial Revolution which happens through the cooperative acquisition of all major industries via the leverage of solidarity in purchasing power.Put Simply: These agreements represent the liberation, emancipation, collective-self realization and Collective-Self Actualization of Humanity.  :) We invite you to take a pause and really feel these words.Are you open to the possibility that this is true, and that what you are about to finish reading is exactly that.  Lets us repeat it.These agreements represent the liberation, emancipation, collective-self realization and Collective Self-Actualization of Humanity.  :) In Essence, this is about the Flowering of Human Consciousness.*Below the 3rd Agreement we also introduce a technological breakthrough in the form of a new and abundant, 100% sustainable natural resource which not only replaces almost everything made from plastic, fiberglass and wood, but also represents an ideal medium for a global solidarity economy which templates how a collective commons can holistically and sustainably steward all of Earths resources. Non only that, but it leverages the millions of tones of plant waste that is either being illegally burnt or stock piled by multiple industries in every country.*These Five Mission Dependent Agreements represent the greatest and fewest agreements humanity Would Have To Make so as to seamlessly transition from a paradigm of fear, separation and scarcity to a paradigm of Love, Collaboration and Abundance. What is The First and Greatest Yes or No Agreement?
Would You Like To See All Those Who Are For World Peace United Around The Exploration Of The Greatest Agreement Which Humanity Could And Would Unite Around, For Creating The Greatest Amount Of Prosperity And With The Greatest Speed And Grace, While Empowering Everyone?Yes Or No?Imagine a local and global open database with 2 categories listing:All those who have said YES, and all those who have not yet said yes,and all those who have been most nominated to respond. Imagine every Mother And Father, Student And Teacher, Ceo, First Nations Leader, Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, Wealthy Philanthropist, Organization, Corporation, Foundation, Union and Institution publicly responding to this single question.* Imagine everyone having access to a public database which lists which people, organzations and corporations have and have not said yes.Phase one of this campaign simply invites humanity to say Yes or No.Would you like to see this happen in and of itself?  ;)  Thy Will Be Done.Phase two of this campaign invites everyone (including all organizations, corporations, political parties and political and religious leaders) to nominate their own three greatest agreements which they feel humanity could and would unite around. Would you like to see this happen in and of itself?  ;)  Thy Will Be Done.Each person and organization will also be invited to nominate three of the greatest agreements which speak to the solutions which their organization is advocating.Would you like this to occur?  Don't you feel like this initiative should already exist? :) What is The Second Greatest Yes or No Agreement?
Would You Like To See All Those Who Are For World Peace Pledge The Equivalent Of $1usd Per Month Towards A Scholarship Program Focused On Exploring And Illustrating The Implications Of Humanity’s Most Nominated Peace Agreements?  Yes or No? This agreement establishes the Peace Legacy Institute with centers in all 196 countries, bringing the brightest and most creative Change Makers together in collaboration, so as to survey, explore and actualize humanity’s most nominated agreements.Imagine being able to search through a database of humanity's most nominated agreements and the discussions which unfold, as well as being able to search through and assess all the agreements nominated by humanity's most prominent leaders...What would be the 3 greatest agreements which the Dalai Lama would advise humanity to consider?What about the President of the USA, or Leonardo Dicaprio? or Vandana Shiva? Or Julian Assange?  Or the Pope?What would be the top 3 most voted up agreements by all members of the Buckminster Fuller Institute, or by all those who have signed The Giving Pledge?In any case, by simply presenting them all with the opportunity to respond to these agreements, everyone will come to realize that these are in fact the greatest agreements. (As you too will also come to realize).It is important to keep in mind that these agreements inspire everyone to think past imaginary national borders and fragmented perspectives. What is The Third Greatest Yes or No Agreement?Would You Like To See All Those Who Are For World Peace Agree To Purchase One Ethical And Sustainable Product Per Year From One Company That Is Owned By Everyone Equally, Where All Revenues Are Distributed Between The Scholarship Program, As Well As Online And Offline Basic Needs Access Centers Everywhere?  Yes Or No? This agreement introduces and establishes the Earth Cooperative. A global co-op that gives every human-being free and equal share of all resources, democratic decision making power and distribution of profits.  This can essentially be considered a form of Universal Living Wage or Basic Unconditional Income, as these would be the natural results of a truly thriving global economy.  Begin imagining now which product you would like to see humanity collaboratively agree to purchase, or which corporation you would like to see humanity cooperatively acquire, potentially re-purpose, and share with one another.  Imagine humanity purchasing all their basic needs from a single company owned by all people, infinitely leveraging solidarity in purchasing power and economy's of scale.  In this context, competition quickly evolves to innovation as oppose to a fight for survival.First Example of Circular Solidarity Economics:Would you like to see 1 billion people agreed to each invest $1/year towards cooperatively acquiring one company that represented a technological breakthrough in sustainability which replaces almost everything made of plastic, wood and fiberglass with a material made 100% of water and cellulose?  (Cellulose is what all plant matter is made of, and there is literally trillions of dollars worth of it being burnt or thrown away every year.)What if 1 billion people agreed to purchase a single pen made out of this material, for the sake of symbolizing the Pen being mightier than the Sword....  Would you agree to do the same?We could even name that Pen: Excalibur ;)That company is called Zeoform.com.  It's Your Company!Second Example of Circular Solidarity Economics:Imagine all those who are for world peace each agreeing to purchase one bag of organic, non-gmo, heirloom hemp seeds per month. This could be done by cooperatively acquiring a global hemp seed company or forming a new company.  In any case, this single agreement literally forms the largest hemp company in the world.  This would obviously be horizontally and vertically integrated, meaning we would cooperatively own all the hemp farms (through land stewardship), and use the entire hemp plant to make zeoform, clothing, and everything else that hemp can be used for.  Consider that when 1 billion people have united, by simply agreeing to purchase one shirt from our own company, we form the most successful clothing company literally over night.  The only monopoly that should exist is the one which all of humanity owns equally.   This obviously leads to humanity forming solidarity economics around telecommunications, sustainable energy, salt, water, and generally everything related to society. What is The Fourth Greatest Yes or No Agreement?
Would You Like To See All Those Who Are For World Peace Invited To Nominate Three People Onto Their Local And Global Wisdom Council Of Women, Men, Youth And Elders, Who Would Present Their Greatest Question, Agreements And Critical Analysis Regarding The Peer Review Of This Formula And The Actualization Of This Entire Project?
 Imagine everyone in your local community nominating a minimum of 12 integral people who they feel has a significant level of expertise regarding all issues mentioned in this campaign, and thus making up everyone's ideal advisory council for the dialogue which follows.  The key here is to raise the level of humanity's awareness on all topics so that everyone can feel that they have the ability and know how to engage in all matters than involve and influence their lives.This is how we empower humanity and unleash the infinite power of public wisdom.  What is The Fifth Greatest Yes or No Agreement? Do You Want To See All Of Those Who Are For World Peace Pledge A Specific Amount Of Money Towards Incentivizing The Unification Of A Specific Number Of People Around These Agreements? ;)  Yes or No? This Agreement introduces the Receiving Pledge.Humanity's Collective Response To The GivingPledge(The Giving Pledge is a Campaign formed by Bill & Melinda Gates and Warren Buffet which has so far united 150+ Philanthropic Billionaires who have each officially and publicly pledged to donate a majority of their wealth towards humanitarian efforts in their life time.) The Receiving Pledge irrefutably illustrates the greatest opportunity for that wealth to be fully leveraged as it Insures Global Unity around the Greatest Agreement with a money back guarantee, as no money would even be transferred until after unity has occurred.  And if that's not enough, after unity has occurred, the first agreement made by the people could be for everyone to pledge $1/person and pay back the billionaires original pledge. (Or $1.50) ;) We Repeat, This means Global Unity is Guaranteed.   Thats Right!  We Just Hacked World Peace Through Global Unity.  Take a few moments to digest that. ""Whatever You Incent Will Happen""~ Elon Musk  (Giving Pledge Signee)(Take a few moments to digest this as well)To be specific:  If each of the 150+ giving pledge billionaires agreed to each donate $10 million towards incentivizing the unification of 1 billion people around even the first 2 agreements, a monthly Billion dollar scholarship program will have been created which translates to 500,000 monthly scholarships each worth $2,000/month.This same agreement could go towards incentivizing one billion people agreeing to each donate $1/day towards all of the most obvious solutions for immediately feeding, clothing and sheltering local people in need.We Repeat: No money would even be transferred from the billionaires until after ""1 billion people"" had agreed to donating $1/month or even per day towards the scholarship program.This is the Ultimate Legacy Project for any billionaire, and especially the first billionaire to support this. GLOBAL UNITY ONLY HAPPENS ONCE.The first billionaire guarantees the rest.  The First Domino.The First Millionaire and the first Billionaire will have created their Legacy as the ones who guaranteed Global Unity with a single decision. Now you know. There is no forgetting.YES, We just hacked philanthropy and capitalism for the greatest good of all.So, are there any millionaires out there who would like to see all of the worlds billionaires united around the Receiving Pledge? ;) (Also keep in mind that most of the Giving Pledge Billionaires have 10-50 billion dollars.Just $1 billion guarantees the unification of humanity. Will You Be The First Millionaire?Will You Be The First Billionaire?Thy Will Be Done.This Entire Campaign creates a One World Dialogue which databases and explores the greatest questions and challenges which could arise during the process of actualizing this vision by bringing together the most integral thought leaders to explore them.In actuality, the moment this formula is validated by a few humanitarian luminaries, the news will be heard around the world, and nothing will be the same again.And just to let you in on a little secret, in the case that it hasn't been made obvious. One of the main reasons why this scientifically irrefutable formula is in fact irrefutable is simply because all refutations that could possibly be conceived are literally part of the process which this formula invokes.  This is because when dealing with scientific and philosophic irrefutability, the peer review dialogue is the actualization process.Just imagine a global database which allows every person on the planet to contribute and vote through a live-stream exploration of all nominated agreements.  This simple process inevitably leads to the illumination of humanity's Agreeable Agreements. This includes all the most nominated questions explored by the ever expanding global peer review team. All of this will be done through the utilization of the most advanced and integrity driven methodologies and technologies for insuring absolute transparency, accountability and open collaboration in an entirely equal opportunity forum/platform.  (See The Future Now) for more details.Simply Put: It is obvious that the most inclusive agreements will Win.We are about to realize Humanity’s First Unanimous Agreement… One World YES!It is inarguable that humanity would desire to agree to create the greatest amount of prosperity, for the greatest number of people, and with the greatest speed and grace.We can create this opportunity NOW. We invite all of humanity’s most prominent humanitarians and wisdom keepers to respond and share their testimony and feedback. With Great Honor,-  LOVE   The Roll Out Process:$144,000 will insure that the mainstream acknowledgement of this revelations existence.  That being said, the fastest way to invite all of humanity to respond to these agreements is by simultaneously launching a $144,000 campaign from within all 196 countries.  This amounts to $28,224,000.  There is no reason why doing so could not unite at least 28,224,000 (144,000 x 196) humanitarians each agreeing to invest $1/month towards the scholarship program which facilitates the national peer review/survey/dialogue.This would equal to $338,688,000/year worth of scholarship funds.(9,408 Monthly Scholarships each valued at $3000)(or 50,000+ Monthly Scholarships if made available in a country like India)The first year of progress would surely prove the value of everyone investing $1/day.Thats 144,000 people x 196 countries x $365/year.This would equal to a scholarship fund of $10,301,760,000/year and billions more in philanthropic donations and social impact investments. During the first 6 months we will surely have received a response to all 5 questions by all of humanity and united everyone into one of the two categories. (It is important to recognize that having everyone actually pledge the money is not the main thing.  The money is in fact just a symbol within this global thought experiment. This is because by the time 1 billion people have responded to these questions and recognized the power in our unity, the follow through will be inevitable as it will be irresistible)That being said; One choice we could all make now is to invite everyone you know to participate in the peer review process, including all nobel peace prize laureates, billionaire philanthropists and world leaders so as to unite all of humanity by the end of the year. ;)The First Version of This Unity Based Thought Experiment can be found on the Facebook Group ""The Greatest Agreement.""Call To Action:This is a clarion call to 144  and/or 1000 critically minded visionaries from each country who will officially commit to participating in the peer review process for validating this formula, and upon validation will commit to each raise $1000  and/or $144 towards launching this campaign.This Peer Review Process quite simply involves each participant agreeing to:- Respond to each of the Greatest Agreements- Present your greatest critical analysis- Respond to all feed back given by other participants regarding your analysis- Provide your testimonial regarding the implications you perceive would result when all 500+ million cultural creatives unite around these agreements.The First $144,000 will go towards bringing together a team of 36 visionary entrepreneurs who will develop this campaign which discloses the existence of this scientifically irrefutable world peace formula to humanity, while developing the scholarship program which facilitates humanity's One World Dialogue.We repeat.  The One World Dialogue IS the Peer Review Process.The Greatest Realization We Can Make Regarding This Disclosure Is Realizing That The Greatest Agreement Has Indeed Been Realized. (Beware of Cognitive Dissonance).This first team of 36 visionaries will live and work under one roof (Location to be confirmed), (Potentially in Bali, Indonesia; Crete, Greece; and/or Hawaii, USA), while broadcasting a live-stream, open, round-table discussion which involves all of humanity to be included and engaged with throughout the entire co-creative process. The first phase of this campaign will focus on:- Creating the campaign template which will be used for uniting and financing all international teams in all 196 countries who will then launch their own nation wide campaign, in their own language, insuring that all people are invited to respond to the five agreements and engage in One World Dialogue.- Inviting all the most prominent humanitarians, organizations and social movements to respond to the ""survey"" containing the 5+ agreements, provide their peer review feedback, testimony, engage in the dialogue, and support the scholarship program.- Uniting 144,000 people who will each agree to micro-sponsor this scholarship program at $1/year, month and then per day.- Co-create a website, survey and multiple RSA styled videos for illustrating the vision in multiple formats so that it can be easily understood by a demographically diverse audience, spanning all cultures and age groups.- Engage with all humanitarians so as to nominate, explore, map and illustrate the top 10  greatest and most voted up agreements which solve each of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as Economic Slavery. ;)Each team of 36 Social Architects will include experts in the following categories:- Project & Campaign Managers- Corporate Shamans/Business Strategists/Social Entrepreneurs- Animal, Environmental and Human Rights Experts- Alliance, Partnership Experts and Non-Violent Dialogue Facilitators- Accountants, Grant Writers and Fundraising Experts- Natural Law, Sovereignty Lawyers- Local, National & Global Multi-Sector Peace Ambassadors/Liaisons- Event and Volunteer Coordinators- Global Village/City Hall 2.0 Technologists- Media Creators and Broadcasters- Web Developers, Programmers and Graphics Designers- Whole Systems Designers/Permaculturists- Eco-Sustainable Architects- Outreach and Social Media teams- Integrative Nutritionists, Therapists and Raw Vegan ChefsThe first $144,000 will be raised by:- 12,000 people each donating $12, or by:- 1000 people each donating $144, or by:- 144 people each donating $1000, or by:-  12 people each donating $12,000In either case, the goal of this first 3 month process will be to unite 144,000 humanitarians who agree to each donate $1/month or day from all 196 countries towards the scholarship program so as to prove the model. Once this is done the world will not be able to deny or ignore the feasibility of this model.
To be considered as one of the first 144 scholarship recipients, you are required to invest a minimum of $1000 to this campaign. (This could easily be done by identifying 10 people who each agree to donating $100).
To be considered as one of the first 1000 scholarship recipients, you are required to invest a minimum of $144 to this campaign. 
The scholarship program will offer a minimum of $3000 worth of room and board.
Individual scholarships may continue indefinitely, based on merit and public support.
Together we will sponsor the most visionary humanitarians, so as to map, finance and execute the greatest and most obvious solutions for achieving all 17 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  Full Disclosure:  One billion cultural creatives uniting most certainly means a unanimous decision to activate our own global debt free currency, a Global Debt Relief Program  (Jubilee) and the End of Centralized Governance, and Centralized Banking based on Usury, Fiat Currency and Inflation.  Well that escalated quickly.... :) Perhaps we can afford world peace and the transcendence of money now, because simply put, counting money is the smoking gun of scarcity mentality.Long Story Short: Centralized Banking Based on Usury = Scarcity Economics and Economic Slavery.  The Peace Legacy Institute will tell the story which all governments should have already done with a hollywood blockbuster budget.  This will be done through an Open Global Research Project regarding the History of Banking, Colonialism, and Predatory Capitalism as designed systems which perpetuate Scarcity. This is a story of how we move from Deceive, Divide and Conquer to Illuminate, Unite and Prosper.   From Corporatism to Cooperativism, Contributionism and Volunteerism.The Co-creation Process:
Host the online peer review process by inviting all the worlds thought leaders to self organize around panel discussions and roundtable meetings by choosing their own ideal 1+ hour time slot on an open google doc calendar. Humanity can nominate the matchmaking process of the ideal peer review teams on a day by day and month by month basis.This will also turn into live-streamed, audience driven, match making round-table summits, where all conversational topics and participants can be nominated by the public.All parties interviewed will be invited to not only respond and discuss the implications of the 5 greatest agreements presented in this campaign, they will be offered an opportunity to present at least one agreement which they feel humanity could and would unite around for creating the greatest amount of prosperity with the greatest speed and grace.
A database of all those who have said yes to the single greatest agreement, all those who have not yet said yes. and all those who have been most nominated to respond.Imagine a list of the most nominated people and corporations who have not yet responded.  Imagine one category for all world leaders, where humanity can clearly see each of their ability to think in contexts which a minimum transcend borders and at maximum compare to the impact that the ""Mission Dependent Agreements"" could have.

A database of all sponsors and collaborators nominated wisdom council members.Imagine a list of all the most nominated youth and elders within all local communities.

An ever evolving Questions and Answers Database which initially covers all topics related to a critical analysis of this entire campaign and all that is being declared as possible. This of course turns into a Universal Database where all the most relevant and potentially controversial topics are discussed and all answers are voted on, based on a variety of metrics. For Example:   What Is The Greatest Conspiracy?!  ;)    Spoiler Alert:  You have infinite potential and direct access to source. ;)
As far as conspiracies go, one need not look any further than the manifestation of fear throughout history in the form of colonialism and the monopolized industries of big pharma, big war, big banking and big meat, big media, big religion and big government.The manifestation of fear can easily be portrayed as the eye that misses the forest for the trees, for we could all be living like eco kings and queens if we could only see the infinite potential of love and cooperation.  Fear and scarcity mentality have an ironic way of blinding one from love and abundance.  The key has been in the palm of our hand the whole time.  That being said, there is an infinitely larger group of men and women whose soul purpose and mission in life is to create world peace by exploring the infinite potentials of love, permaculture, sustainability, community and collaboration for the greatest good of all. Those who have caught a glimpse of loves awesome power have the ultimate ""inside story"".We recognize that the ""Apocalypse"", which is transpiring right now is specifically about the illumination of humanity's individual and collective shadow and the unveiling of all things that were once hidden.  (See Wiki Definition)  Things are not necessarily getting worse. The corruption, suffering and lack of integrity is simply being illuminated for all to see.  Individually and collectively.  Inside and out.There are hundreds of millions of beings who are conspiring for humanity by going within through prayer and meditation, so as to remember who they truly are, as the Light at the end of the tunnel.  We are the ones we have been waiting for.This Campaign is about the Greatest Conspiracy For You.There is nothing and will never be anything as powerful as Love.Not just as a fuzzy emotion, but as a actual frequency which allows for obvious truth to be illuminated before your eyes.  The vibration of fear is how deception works.  Through fear, we can easily fool ourselves into believing the silliest notions. Love is what the very fabric of reality which allows the gift of contrast to exist.This is why we need not spend hardly any time looking backwards, if only to realize how far we have come. Its time to set sail on the shortest path to world peace. Life Can Be Divided Into Two Categories:The Nature of Reality & The Objects In Reality""When You Change The Way You Look At Things, The Things You Look At Change.""- Wayne Dyer The Cat Is Out of the BagThe Genie Is Out Of The LampThis Campaign = Checkmate to the Old Paradigm(A Forgiveness Campaign as Fear & Scarcity's Greatest Exit Strategy)

<p>Für das wegweisende Projekt „Alpen Klezmer“ wurde ich mit
dem Deutschen Weltmusikpreis ausgezeichnet, habe nun die koscheren Gebirgsjodler ins
Reisebündel gepackt und ziehe mit meinen weiteren musikalischen Forschungsreisenden über die Alpen. Wir wildern, wie und wo es uns gefällt
und schmuggeln Lieder über den Brenner auf der Suche nach Jiddischland bis man
nicht mehr weiß, ob Obergiesing nicht doch in Italien liegt. Wir ziehen weiter
und weiter, der Sehnsucht nach, die die Richtung, aber nie ein Ziel vorgibt. Wild und rau geht's zu, aber auch sanft und beseelt. Jodler verschmelzen mit Nigunim, italienisch-jüdische
Peysakh-Lieder treffen auf bayrische Flüsse und das murmelnde Rauschen des
Meeres gibt den Takt dazu.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ich bewege mich seit 30 Jahren in der jiddischen Musik mit unterschiedlichsten Projekten.

<h3>Die Folgen</h3>
<p>Wie schon bei der ersten Alpen Klezmer-CD geht es mir nicht nur darum, zwei musikalische Volksmusiktraditionen mit einander zu kombinieren. Vor vier Jahren war es mir ein großes Anliegen, die gemeinsamen Wurzeln jiddischer und bayrischer Volksmusik aufzuzeigen und dadurch darauf zu verweisen, dass wir alle auf einer tiefen menschlichen Ebene miteinander verbunden sind. Ganz nebenbei und gar nicht in erster Linie geplant, hat sich dadurch ein neues Genre entwickelt, nämlich ""Alpen Klezmer"".  Die Stadt München hat mir dafür den Volkskulturpreis ""Innovationen"" 2012 verliehen und 2014 erhielten Ilya Shneyveys, mein musikalischer Partner, und ich den ""Deutschen Weltmusikpreis"" des TFF Rudolstadt. Der Erfolg war fast überwältigend, denn damit hatte ich in dieser Form nicht gerechnet. Selbstverständlich habe ich mich sehr über die Anerkennung gefreut und bin sehr glücklich, diese Preise erhalten zu haben!</p>
<p>Alpen Klezmer ""Zum Meer!"" geht einen Schritt weiter. Die Fusion der beiden Stile, sprachlich, musikalisch, auf Makro- und auf Mikroebene, hat es mir ermöglicht, eine eigenständige künstlerische Sprache zu entwickeln. ""Zum Meer"" ist ein wichtiger Schritt dahin, diesen Weg weiterzugehen. Die Unterstützung der Kollegen, nicht zuletzt die Unterstützung durch Alan Bern, aber zweifelsohne auch euer Zuspruch bei Konzerten, ist sehr wichtig für mich. Durch euch bekomme ich die Kraft, meine Stimme gegen Hass, Neid und Missgunst zu erheben und mich weiterhin für eine friedliche Welt einzusetzen. Klingt pathetisch? Ist aber genauso!</p>
<p>Ich bin fest davon überzeugt, dass wir nur dann eine friedliebendere Welt schaffen können, wenn sich die unterschiedlichen Kulturen offen und mit Neugierde begegnen und sich gegenseitig ihre Schönheiten zeigen. Nur so erkennen wir uns selbst im Anderen und identifizieren uns letztendlich mit dem, was anfangs sehr fremd und bedrohlich erschien.</p>
<p>Ich hoffe, dass meine Arbeit euch in eurem Alltag dazu inspiriert, Haltung zu zeigen, Ausgrenzung entgegenzutreten und Partei zu ergreifen für die, die ihre eigene Stimme nicht hörbar machen können. Und natürlich kommt hoffentlich jede Menge aufregende Musik dabei heraus, die Herz und Hirn beschwingt und das Tanzbein zucken lässt.</p>

<p><i>Having been awarded the German World Music Prize for the groundbreaking

am heading over the Alps to Italy.
We’ll be roaming wherever we please, smuggling songs over the mountain passes

somewhere in Bella Italia. As always, we’ll follow our heart wherever it takes
us, but who knows exactly where? One thing’s for sure – it’s going to be wild
and raw as well as tender and soulful. Yodellers will embrace Nigunim, Jewish
Italian pesach songs will blend with Bavarian ballads, and all this to the
backing vocals of the warm, lapping waters of the Mediterranean.  </i></p>
<p><i>I’ve been involved with Yiddish music for about 30 years now, working on
a whole range of different projects. Then about 5 years ago, I started to get
more and more interested in my Bavarian musical roots. And the result of this has

<p><i>An illustrious line-up of performers from both the Klezmer and Bavarian scenes
has come together in an ecstatic celebration of this great musical adventure.
We’ve had the great good fortune to be joined by a Grammy award-winning

<p><i>As on our first Alpen Klezmer CD, I’m not just concerned with the musical aspect of combining two great folk traditions.

It was almost by chance and quite unexpectedly that this new genre came into being. I was fortunate enough to be awarded the Munich prize for cultural innovation in 2012, and then in 2014 my musical partner Ilya Shneyveys and I received the German Prize for World Music. I had never expected this kind of recognition and am overwhelmed by the success of the project! I’m absolutely thrilled to have won these awards!</i></p>
<p><i>The Alpen Klezmer To the Sea! project takes everything a step further. The fusion of the micro and macro levels of both styles, both linguistically and musically, has made it possible to develop a unique artistic language, and To the Sea! is a vital stage in this new journey. The support of all my colleagues, not least that of Alan Bern, and also your enthusiastic response to concerts, mean such a lot. They give me the strength to speak out against hatred, envy and resentment and to do all I can to contribute to a peaceful world. That might sound a bit cheesy, but it really is incredibly important to me.</i></p>
<p><i>I am firmly convinced that we can create a more peace-loving world if we open ourselves to other cultures with a spirit of curiosity, and a desire to share the beautiful things which each of us has to offer. Only in this way can we find ourselves mirrored in the eyes of others and learn to identify with what at first can perhaps seem alienating and threatening.</i></p>
<p><i>I hope that my work can inspire you to have the courage to stand up against marginalization, and to speak out for those who don’t have a voice of their own. And of course there will also be an enormous amount of fabulous music which will touch both hearts and minds, and get everyone up on the dance floor as well!</i></p>

HintergrundAlpen Klezmer - Zum Meer!



Bayrisch * jiddisch* wuid und koscher
Für das wegweisende Projekt „Alpen Klezmer“ wurde ich mit
dem Deutschen Weltmusikpreis ausgezeichnet, habe nun die koscheren Gebirgsjodler ins
Reisebündel gepackt und ziehe mit meinen weiteren musikalischen Forschungsreisenden über die Alpen. Wir wildern, wie und wo es uns gefällt
und schmuggeln Lieder über den Brenner auf der Suche nach Jiddischland bis man
nicht mehr weiß, ob Obergiesing nicht doch in Italien liegt. Wir ziehen weiter
und weiter, der Sehnsucht nach, die die Richtung, aber nie ein Ziel vorgibt. Wild und rau geht's zu, aber auch sanft und beseelt. Jodler verschmelzen mit Nigunim, italienisch-jüdische
Peysakh-Lieder treffen auf bayrische Flüsse und das murmelnde Rauschen des
Meeres gibt den Takt dazu.
Ich bewege mich seit 30 Jahren in der jiddischen Musik mit unterschiedlichsten Projekten. Vor etwa 5 Jahren reifte in mir die Idee, mich musikalisch auch meinen bayrischen Wurzeln zu widmen. Im Spannungsfeld zwischen Tradition und Innovation entstand daraus ein neues Genre: Alpen Klezmer. Ich reiste damit von Schleswig-Holstein bis in die Alpen, von der Eifel bis in den Bayrischen Wald und von Bulgarien bis New York.
Zum Einspielen der Lieder hat sich eine illustre Auswahl an Musikern der Klezmerwelt und alpenländischen Musikwelt eingefunden, um gemeinsam, in das große Abenteuer einer einzigen große musikalische Ekstase einzugehen. Unter anderem hat der Grammy-Gewinner und Sänger der Klezmatics den weiten Weg auf sich genommen, um mit ins Studio zu gehen, aber auch Ex-Biermösl Stofferl Well war wieder mit dabei. Das Lineup, findet ihr, wenn ihr weiter nach unten scrollt.
Eure Unterstützung hilft mir dabei folgende Kosten zu decken: Studio, Mischen, Mastern, Aufnahmehonorare der Kollegen, Pressematerial und Promoclip.

<p>The <b>Concert without Borders/Concierto
sin Fronteras</b> unites people through the power of performing music together. We
are musicians from the Arizona/Sonora Borderlands who present a concert at the border
wall every spring to break down barriers of fear and mistrust that sometimes might divide us. We sing out for unity and everyone’s right to live and work
and love where they please. </p>
<p>The <b>Concert</b> is a project of the
<i>Binational Arts Institute</i>, whose mission is the strengthening of our community
through binational arts education, performance, and exchange. We partner with a
wide range of cultural, educational, and international entities to develop
programs in collaboration with actors on both sides. <b>Concert</b> sponsors include the
<i>Mexican Consulate of Douglas</i>, the <i>Casa de Cultura</i> in Agua Prieta, <i>Cochise College</i>, <i>Galiano's Cafe, Cafe Justo, KBRP, </i>and the <i>Sister</i> <i>Cities of Douglas </i>and<i> Agua Prieta</i>. This year’s performers include guitarist Dieter Hennings, Agua Prieta’s Orquesta Municipal,
the Binational Chorus, the Bisbee band <i>Essential Elements</i>, the
Orlando Suárez Blues Band, members of the Orquesta Sinfónica  of Hermosillo, a children’s chorus, and many others. This year we will perform together: instruments, singers, dancers, and children on both sides of the wall. Our repertoire will explore our theme <i>Artists for Peace.  </i>Our joint works include  <i>Little Birds</i> by Eric Whitacre; <i>Portones Abiertos </i>by Paul Basler; <i>Chichester Psalms, </i>3rd Movement by Leonard Bernstein; <i>Los Ninos Queremos la Paz </i>and <i>Color Esperanza</i>.  We will have art projects for kids during the concert in conjunction with <i>Galiano's Cafe.  </i>We are excited about getting even more of you involved through this campaign.  </p>
<p>We need to raise $3,500.00 for this year’s
<b>Concert</b>. The money will go for travel expenses and modest payments to string
players from the Hermosillo Symphony, musicians from Agua Prieta, the sound
system, and the construction of symmetrical stages on both sides of the wall.  We are confident we will reach our entire funding
goal. If we do not, we will go ahead, making cuts in our budget across the
board.</p>
<p>This is our fourth year
presenting a unique and important event, free and open to the public. Many people return
every year, as performers and audience, and can testify to the doors we open to
friendship and trust through the <b>Concert without Borders</b>. We have overcome a series

</div></div>","The Concert without Borders/Concierto
sin Fronteras unites people through the power of performing music together. We
are musicians from the Arizona/Sonora Borderlands who present a concert at the border
wall every spring to break down barriers of fear and mistrust that sometimes might divide us. We sing out for unity and everyone’s right to live and work
and love where they please. 
The Concert is a project of the
Binational Arts Institute, whose mission is the strengthening of our community
through binational arts education, performance, and exchange. We partner with a
wide range of cultural, educational, and international entities to develop
programs in collaboration with actors on both sides. Concert sponsors include the
Mexican Consulate of Douglas, the Casa de Cultura in Agua Prieta, Cochise College, Galiano's Cafe, Cafe Justo, KBRP, and the Sister Cities of Douglas and Agua Prieta. This year’s performers include guitarist Dieter Hennings, Agua Prieta’s Orquesta Municipal,
the Binational Chorus, the Bisbee band Essential Elements, the
Orlando Suárez Blues Band, members of the Orquesta Sinfónica  of Hermosillo, a children’s chorus, and many others. This year we will perform together: instruments, singers, dancers, and children on both sides of the wall. Our repertoire will explore our theme Artists for Peace.  Our joint works include  Little Birds by Eric Whitacre; Portones Abiertos by Paul Basler; Chichester Psalms, 3rd Movement by Leonard Bernstein; Los Ninos Queremos la Paz and Color Esperanza.  We will have art projects for kids during the concert in conjunction with Galiano's Cafe.  We are excited about getting even more of you involved through this campaign.  
We need to raise $3,500.00 for this year’s
Concert. The money will go for travel expenses and modest payments to string
players from the Hermosillo Symphony, musicians from Agua Prieta, the sound
system, and the construction of symmetrical stages on both sides of the wall.  We are confident we will reach our entire funding
goal. If we do not, we will go ahead, making cuts in our budget across the
board.
This is our fourth year
presenting a unique and important event, free and open to the public. Many people return
every year, as performers and audience, and can testify to the doors we open to
friendship and trust through the Concert without Borders. We have overcome a series
of technical challenges since the first year; this year we will use one sound
system on both stages! Help us break down barriers!

Music has been such a giant influence on my life, and while I just recently released my first EP, Rebelle, I'm ready to start working on my next album, Broken Doll; which is slated to have 12-15 songs. You can find Rebelle on my website (<a href=""http://www.sarabehackney.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sarabehackney.com</a>). </p><p>I grew up in Greensburg, IN (a very country town), but my heart has always been turned to rock n' roll. I'm inspired by the likes of Pat Benatar, Tori Kelly, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, and Alanis Morissette. The music I write is very pop/rock with some influences of r&amp;b and indie on certain songs; which is what you can expect on this album as well. For me, music has always been an escape, a love and passion. I want to provide that escapism and projection of feelings for others to hear.</p><p>What this money will do, will allow you to be a part of my journey. By donating, you get a little piece of my soul back. I didn't want to sell my EP album, Rebelle, for any money so that I could just get my music out there to the fans. However, if you would like to donate to this album so I can order more copies, this is the place to do so!! I have a lot of great packages, and you will be the first to hear my new music and rock my new merch. </p><p></p><p><b>What I need for the album:</b></p><p><b>$1,000 for producing, mixing, and duplicating</b></p><ul>

Music has been such a giant influence on my life, and while I just recently released my first EP, Rebelle, I'm ready to start working on my next album, Broken Doll; which is slated to have 12-15 songs. You can find Rebelle on my website (www.sarabehackney.com). I grew up in Greensburg, IN (a very country town), but my heart has always been turned to rock n' roll. I'm inspired by the likes of Pat Benatar, Tori Kelly, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, and Alanis Morissette. The music I write is very pop/rock with some influences of r&b and indie on certain songs; which is what you can expect on this album as well. For me, music has always been an escape, a love and passion. I want to provide that escapism and projection of feelings for others to hear.What this money will do, will allow you to be a part of my journey. By donating, you get a little piece of my soul back. I didn't want to sell my EP album, Rebelle, for any money so that I could just get my music out there to the fans. However, if you would like to donate to this album so I can order more copies, this is the place to do so!! I have a lot of great packages, and you will be the first to hear my new music and rock my new merch. What I need for the album:$1,000 for producing, mixing, and duplicating
This includes burning 500 more albums  to be handed out.
$400  for mastering 5 songs$150 for 500 digital download cards$20 for a UPC barcode for distribution in stores$89 to sell on Amazon, iTunes, Facebook, GooglePlay etc.$99 for 300 11"" x 17"" postersIf I don't reach my goal?I'll start at the top of the list and get as far as I can with it.  Either way, I will put all of my heart and passion into this project, but in order for it to really get out there and get heard, I need the full amount at a minimum. What if I go above my goal?I will be able to put that into publicity like sponsored Facebook ads, advertising, creative marketing campaign materials and targeted marketing to support my CD Release.The ImpactYour contribution will truly make a difference:In a world of high powered record labels, there is a demand for independent music across the country.
Many community, public, and local radio stations are growing in numbers and strength because people like me want to hear original music with a heart.
I want to use this music to inspire other ""little guys"" to follow their dreams, open their hearts and follow their passion.

The Battle emerged after their prior project (The Real California) dissolved in 2014. Insisting that the music continue, the brothers teamed up with guitarist Chris Shaheen, singer Cory Smith, and bassist Tom Nemo. After nearly a year of writing, the band is ready to complete and release its first album.</p><div>
</div><p>The songs will come in the form of a concept album. This won't be just a collection of songs or singles, but an exploration of themes that range from addiction to epiphany, telling a story of risky love, addiction, and loss. While each song is strong enough to stand on its own, the value of the album will come from the experience of listening to it from start to finish. We feel like this is an important aspect of music that has been lost over the years. We think it's the perfect way to tell a story, and we want you to hear it!</p><div>
</div><p>Your contribution will help us finish the recordings, but it will also help us with the behind-the-scenes stuff like the long hours of mixing, mastering, artwork and graphic design, pressing, and of course the contribution perks.</p><p>We are a local independent rock band. As such, we value supporting local businesses in helping us make our music. With funds raised, we will call on local graphic artists, sound engineers, and CD manufacturers to help us create the album. This contributes to the local economy and taps local talent. It's an investment in us, but also an investment in the local scene from musicians to designers. </p><div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here's exactly what we need and why:</p>
<p>Studio time: $600 This is a great rate which will get us about 10-12 hours of recording time.</p>
<p>Mixing: $500 We will need a studio, engineer, and equipment that we don't have in order to mix the album properly. This is where each song gets its own sound and feel and, we believe, is an extension of the musical creation process.</p>
<p>Mastering: $1000 Mastering is what happens after everything is recorded and mixed. To make an analogy, it's the difference between watching a DVD (mixed songs) and watching a Blu-Ray (mastered songs). Everything is brighter, clearer, louder, more dimensional. This is the difference between something sounding merely good versus sounding professional. And we want professional. </p>
<p>Manufacturing: $500 This includes CD replication, graphic design, packaging.</p>
<p>Perks: $400 This money will provide us the funds to make the t-shirts, posters, and other perks. We have some unique perks and opportunities lined up for contributors, so we can't wait to get these going for you. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
</div><div> Your impact can't be overstated. Simply put, without you the album won't be the best version of itself. We feel like we are making relevant rock music, that we are contributing to the canon in more authentic ways than big mainstream rock bands. Music is our passion, and we want to share our music with you! The biggest advantage there is about supporting this project--aside from the album itself--is that you can trust our track record. While this will be The Battle's first release, Ron and Donne have recorded and released 5 albums and 1 EP on their own, and have recorded on several other artist's and band's albums. We are well versed in this process and know exactly what it takes to do it right.   </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> With any recording project, there's a lot that can go wrong. And you can bet there will be some challenges. The biggest problem we face is anything that delays the progress of releasing an album. This could be anything from booked up studio time to manufacturing problems. The last time we  released an album under a different band, we had problems with the ""master"" CD being replicated that delayed the replication by several days (which was bad because we'd already planned a CD release show--and you can't have a release show without the CDs!). After many phone calls and a few trips to a Columbus studio for assistance, all was fixed and everything was fine. This is an example of what can go wrong, and how we worked a solution to the problem without delaying the release of the album.</p>
<p>Given that we've done this process several times, our experience and connections with great people who know what they are doing really make the difference and will ensure that even in spite of challenges, we will work quickly to adjust and reach the goal.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know that not everyone will be able to contribute. If you can't, that's totally okay!

<h3>Who we are...</h3>
<div>Hello!  We are Room of Voices, a dynamic duo,  Mingo Lewis and Karissa ""Sound Sapien.""  The universe brought us together about 6 years ago when Mingo was crafting a new kind of music, and Karissa was traveling, and ended on Mingo's porch through a mutual friend and overheard some sounds coming from within. And long story short, that was the beginning of the magic of Room of Voices. The two of us starting working together at a recording studio in Northern California, and began crafting our sound together. We travelled, toured and moved across the country, and now are working on our newest album ""Casbah."" A combination of shockingly electric funk, with worldly ethnic sounds.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mingo's incredible experience performing with artists such as Santana, Chick Corea, The Tubes, Todd Rundgren and many others, along with Karissa's imaginative ideas inspired by the music of the 80's, 90's hip-hip and electronic, has created a new direction and a very powerful sound that is unique to Room of Voices. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have done several albums already, and this new album, ""Casbah,"" will be our fourth album. Our intention with this album is to record the music in a way that really takes our listeners on a journey, just like the way it is at a live show. We have had countless fans tell us that our music is so amazing and powerful when experienced in person, and our last several albums didn't have that effect because we used programed drums rather than acoustic drums.  So this will be our very first album capturing our whole live sound with live drums, and on vinyl! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We love the quality of vinyl, and we will also be releasing digital downloads of the album.  And to give you the visual experience that you enjoy at our shows, we are going to produce two live music videos, which will feature the expressive performance of Karissa's new instrument, the Theremin, along with video imagery projection and the power of Mingo's live drums. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We invite you to join us on this journey, to produce Room of Voices most influential album yet.... ""Casbah!""</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul></ul>
<div>
<p>We are so proud to be an independent band, with our own unique underground sound, however there are challenges that come along with being independent. The biggest challenge being the initial investment needed to create high quality music and video productions, along with the resources needed to promote and spread the word about our project. And this is where we need your help.</p>
<p>As much as we love recording in our basement :) And still many of our ideas will always be formed there, having your help to really do this the right way, and record in a professional studio with state of the art equipment, engineers, and mastering will really help us to bring our music to the next level. We really hope you will engage with us and become part of the creation of our next album by contributing and helping us spread the word. And in return we have some pretty amazing rewards for you. </p>
<p>We've got Room of Voices HOODIES! Oh yess.. who doesn't need another good hoddie as we head into the fall/winter. :)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477446402/ghozsnpmbwf7eyfvhndm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And of course we will have Casbah on Vinyl, for all of you music collectors out there, we know you know that Vinyl just sounds better than digital, and this will be the first ever Room of Voices album with live drums! And we've also got digital copies of Casbah available to everyone to download and add to your playlist. </p>
<p>We've even got some super special one of a kind drum sticks.. bucky beavers, I call them, once Mingo uses a pair of sticks for more than a few songs... it almost looks like some kind of construction zone around his drum set, with wood chips all around, so get a piece of the action with a pair of Mingo's sticks used to record the album.</p>

Who we are...
Hello!  We are Room of Voices, a dynamic duo,  Mingo Lewis and Karissa ""Sound Sapien.""  The universe brought us together about 6 years ago when Mingo was crafting a new kind of music, and Karissa was traveling, and ended on Mingo's porch through a mutual friend and overheard some sounds coming from within. And long story short, that was the beginning of the magic of Room of Voices. The two of us starting working together at a recording studio in Northern California, and began crafting our sound together. We travelled, toured and moved across the country, and now are working on our newest album ""Casbah."" A combination of shockingly electric funk, with worldly ethnic sounds.
 
Mingo's incredible experience performing with artists such as Santana, Chick Corea, The Tubes, Todd Rundgren and many others, along with Karissa's imaginative ideas inspired by the music of the 80's, 90's hip-hip and electronic, has created a new direction and a very powerful sound that is unique to Room of Voices.

<p>Thank you for
taking the time to check out my page.  This dream is only possible through partners like you.  These songs were written with you in mind and with a dream of collaborating with you as midwives in this beautiful and strange process of recording a new CD.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span></p>
<p>I was a
singer/songwriter long before I was a priest and I was wonderfully and
marvelously made member of the LGBTQQ community long before I was a
singer/songwriter.  But, in reflecting on my life journey up to this point,
God was present all throughout this beautiful and strange trek.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this
project??  Good question.  I have been writing music since the age of
12, and as I have grown and stretched out in my skin, my songs have also grown and stretched out and this latest batch is shining
the light into my current life- and they reflect the beautiful messiness of
doubt and belief, wonder and joy, hope and concern that comes with following
God's call upon our lives.  </p>
<p>This CD is a
culmination of finally feeling comfortable in my own skin and singing from a place that holds the tension of
being both beloved and wary- it can be scary, mystifying, beautiful, but always worth the struggle.</p>
<p>Fran McKendree will be sitting in the producer's seat at Teerivane Studios as we weave together these songs into a beautiful tapestry that we can wrap ourselves in and listen as each story unfolds.  Fran and I have worked together on several projects over the course of the past 15 years and it was his guidance and encouragement that made my 3rd CD, ""Lessons in Life and Love"" such a life changing experience for me and for many people who have sung along with me in their cars, gyms, trails, and commutes.</p>
<p>I pray that for those who sponsor this project
and those that benefit from your support are able to hear God in these songs and
remember that there is nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing, we can do that
will ever make God stop loving us.</p>
<p></p>

<p>There just aren't that many LGBTQQ Christian Singer/Songwriters in the world and our voice is a voice for all those who are on a spiritual journey with doubt and questions as traveling companions.  This album of songs will help shine light in the darkness, rekindle hope in the hopeless and offer peace to those who may have been at war with the world, with themselves or even with God.  Love, Death, Life, Birth, Rebirth, Forgiveness, Freedom, Grace- this album covers all of that and there is someone, right now, in your life who could really, really benefit from hearing a song or two on this CD.  Maybe that person is you.  </p>
<p>Many people have faced and continue to face so much hurt and shame at the hands of people who call themselves Christians.  For their own safety and security, they leave behind communities of faith for their own preservation.  Many wander in that wilderness believing what they have been told- that they are an abomination, they are unloved and unwanted, they are shameful creatures and they are unworthy of love.  Oh my friends, my sweet, sweet, friends.  I want desperately to sing to them about the God that loves each of us, completely, wholly, just as we are and without any hesitation.  Your support, your encouragement, your sharing in this with me will help make that possible.  </p>

</div></div>","HELLO WORLD!  My name is Ginny Wilder, a singer/songwriter/priest in the Episcopal Church living and serving in Wilmington, Delaware.
Thank you for
taking the time to check out my page.  This dream is only possible through partners like you.  These songs were written with you in mind and with a dream of collaborating with you as midwives in this beautiful and strange process of recording a new CD.  
I was a
singer/songwriter long before I was a priest and I was wonderfully and
marvelously made member of the LGBTQQ community long before I was a
singer/songwriter.  But, in reflecting on my life journey up to this point,
God was present all throughout this beautiful and strange trek.
Why am I doing this
project??  Good question.  I have been writing music since the age of
12, and as I have grown and stretched out in my skin, my songs have also grown and stretched out and this latest batch is shining
the light into my current life- and they reflect the beautiful messiness of
doubt and belief, wonder and joy, hope and concern that comes with following
God's call upon our lives.  
This CD is a
culmination of finally feeling comfortable in my own skin and singing from a place that holds the tension of
being both beloved and wary- it can be scary, mystifying, beautiful, but always worth the struggle.
Fran McKendree will be sitting in the producer's seat at Teerivane Studios as we weave together these songs into a beautiful tapestry that we can wrap ourselves in and listen as each story unfolds.  Fran and I have worked together on several projects over the course of the past 15 years and it was his guidance and encouragement that made my 3rd CD, ""Lessons in Life and Love"" such a life changing experience for me and for many people who have sung along with me in their cars, gyms, trails, and commutes.
I pray that for those who sponsor this project
and those that benefit from your support are able to hear God in these songs and
remember that there is nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing, we can do that
will ever make God stop loving us.



There just aren't that many LGBTQQ Christian Singer/Songwriters in the world and our voice is a voice for all those who are on a spiritual journey with doubt and questions as traveling companions.  This album of songs will help shine light in the darkness, rekindle hope in the hopeless and offer peace to those who may have been at war with the world, with themselves or even with God.  Love, Death, Life, Birth, Rebirth, Forgiveness, Freedom, Grace- this album covers all of that and there is someone, right now, in your life who could really, really benefit from hearing a song or two on this CD.  Maybe that person is you.  
Many people have faced and continue to face so much hurt and shame at the hands of people who call themselves Christians.  For their own safety and security, they leave behind communities of faith for their own preservation.  Many wander in that wilderness believing what they have been told- that they are an abomination, they are unloved and unwanted, they are shameful creatures and they are unworthy of love.  Oh my friends, my sweet, sweet, friends.  I want desperately to sing to them about the God that loves each of us, completely, wholly, just as we are and without any hesitation.  Your support, your encouragement, your sharing in this with me will help make that possible.  


   Just the facts, ma'am.
$12,000.00 bucks will get us:

Pre-production: This is an important preliminary step standard in any commercial recording project. Fran McKendree and I are already listening to the demos and talking about arrangements,  structure, and dreaming about ideas that will add layers, textures and colors to the songs.  This part is basically putting the bones together that we will build on in the studio. 


Musicians & Recording: Next, Fran and I will hire local musicians to play a multitude of different instruments to help breathe life int these songs: drums and percussion, electric and acoustic bass and guitar, piano and strings (your donation will not only be helping me, but will support lots of working musicians!)  
Mixing & Mastering: Each track will be mixed to make the composition come to life, with lots of contrast in volume, color and texture. As a final step, the album will be mastered from beginning to end, so the listening experience is cohesive and carefully choreographed from start to finish.

Production/Pressing- The CDs don't make themselves so your kind and generous donation will make sure the the CDs are pressed and come in a really beautiful package.  Album liner notes are not antiquated, they have been raised to a new level of appreciation.  Your donation will help me tell more of the story behind this CD through the CD jacket and artwork.

Travel: I live in Delaware.  Fran lives in North Carolina.  It is a great deal easier for me to go to Fran and his studio than it is to bring Fran and his studio to Delaware.  


I wish I could give you the world, but alas, that is not mine to give.  I do have some ideas, though, to help show you some love for the love you have shown this project.  There is a whole list of donating options and gifts to the right of this box but just to highlight a few: Download of the new album, Signed copy of the new Album, Hand written lyrics to the song of your choice complete with a thank you note, Release Party Meet and Greet, Dinner and a show at our house in Wilmington, Delaware,  I will marry you (and your beloved) here in Delaware, Your own private concert at your house or church,  thank yous and shout outs and some other fun stuff.  Risks & Challenges The first risk is that I will receive a whole mess of hate mail from people who cannot make it add up in their hearts that I do, indeed, believe that even as a gay person, that God loves me.  
Another risk is that believing in God has become grounds to be dismissed as weak or ignorant or be seen as a lemming.  I will go ahead and say that as a person who has fought tooth and nail to be an openly gay married priest, I am not weak, ignorant or a lemming.  I am brave, strong, wise and a pretty damn good leader.
Challenges- I have a very short window to get the recording done.  It will be a challenge but Fran and I believe that even though it will be challenging, it will add to the stories we will tell each other for years to come.

<p>I am happy to announce that my new
album Open Kimono has been completed. </p>
<p>It's my first full length solo
record and it showcases about ten years of music made with an amazing list of
very talented musicians, engineers and mixers. It took over 1,000 hours of
studio time to bring it to life and now I am really excited to share it with
you.</p>
<p>Here's a sneak peek video with audio
from all of the tracks on the album!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>Autopsy of a Dead Duck</p>
<p>This song was started in April 2009 when I was doing an
artist residency at Ucross in Wyoming. I was living in the midst of the most
breathtaking scenery in the American west and spending every day in a beautiful
studio with a grand piano. This was my first attempt to write a song entirely
on piano. The lyrics are an exploration of depression and redemption, with some
Chinese food puns thrown in, and a little Beatles homage. I finished the song
in my studio in Dumbo, adding drums, guitars, backwards drums, keyboards, and a
trumpet solo that I’m very proud of, which repeats itself in reverse.</p>
<p>Eat What You Kill</p>
<p>This was written in about 2006 while I was composing
music for the film Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soapbox. It started as a little folk
guitar riff inspired by an open E minor tuning but never made the film. It was after
my band Sea Foxx broke up and before my band The Snow was created, but it never
made it to the Snow’s repertoire, though Hilary Downes did sing on it. It’s
part of a long list of songs imploring people to be better citizens of the
earth.</p>
<p>Lepidoptera</p>
<p>This song goes way back to about 2005. The intro crooning
is from a talented gentleman I recorded on the subway who was wooing all the
ladies on the platform, and which dovetails nicely with the content and tone.
The drum fills were analog drums recorded on a first generation iPod with an
amazing compression/limiting effect happening by accident. The wobbly guitars
were made with an ebow and blasted through a little Rickenbacker amp with
fantastic built-in vibrato and distortion. Same with the synths. Vocals were
recorded in one sleepy take through a little radio mic I found in the garage of
a deceased man in San Diego that I was hired to clean out. The subject matter
is one very weird and wonderful night in the East Village in another life.</p>
<p>NRA-hole</p>
<p>I believe in standing up for what I believe and speaking
out, or in this case, singing out. I had fun making
this song with two overlapping drum beats and various percussion instruments,
as well as layers of divergent guitars and horns. And it’s fun to sing really
angry, passionate lyrics in really hushed, close harmonies.</p>
<p>Stay Calm</p>
<p>Life in New York City can really stress you out. This is
my mantra to attempt to chill out when the day to day becomes too much. It
started as three syncopated bass lines weaved together over drums. I then added
some very improvisational, accidental synths, organ and piano that became the
main riffs, then I added the guitars, and then the lyrics came like a package
delivered to the wrong address, fully formed. I wanted the groove to channel
Steely Dan’s Showbiz Kids. Gerald Menke came with his genius pedal steel for
the finishing touch. </p>
<p>Two By Two</p>
<p>Written for my twins when they were two years old. Going
for a really open, happy, California vibe. Started with some chords and a piano
riff and grew from there. </p>
<p>Follow the Drone</p>
<p>Built around a two-chord progression on the Rhodes, then
layered with piles of sludge guitars. The end is a vacuum cleaner, a fan, and
some helicopter sounds. Devin Greenwood really dialed it in with some added
sounds. The drone is an impersonal observer floating above the earth, watching
all the beautiful and awful things we humans do to each other, and occasionally
dropping bombs. This could be considered a companion song to The Snow’s Silent
Parade.</p>
<p>Top of the Food Chain</p>
<p>Inspired by a book I read that explores all of humanity’s
foibles through the lens of simple natural selection. We are the strongest
therefore we dominate and destroy. But our large brain might also be the
solution. This was recorded many years ago and features Dorit Chrysler on
theremin, Hilary Downes on vocals, Frank Heer on chromatic harmonica, and
Quentin Jennings on harpsichord. </p>

<br/>
I have worked for many years as a professional lyricist, singer and writer of cultural commentary. Regular followers of my work will be aware that I am also a survivor of abuse. <br/><br/>Even though I refrained from speaking openly about this issue, it always found its way into my life and my work. I told myself to get over it, stop whinging and move on. That never happened, so I became the life and soul of the party and made some terrible life choices. I found myself reliving toxic habits with other broken souls and, funnily enough, this all turned out to be a rather bad idea. Everything changed five years ago when I became the victim of particularly horrific assault. <br/><br/><h3><b>This is not a 'poor me' pity party. This is a project of authentic acquiescence.  </b></h3>
I did what any other aging, sober, Rock'n'Roll drama queen would do with a ridiculous midlife crisis and a head full of lyrics. I bought an electric ukulele, put on a cheap, theatrical mask and became anonymous - <i>a mystery</i>. I began turning up at open mic events around the world and singing the songs I had written about abusive relationships. <br/><br/>And you know what? <br/><br/>People got it. <br/><br/>Who knew? <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461945464/12045694_1126336420729024_5553592321547581677_o_v8w3jd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>On my travels, I have been overwhelmed by the number of people who have approached me asking to buy my songs. If I'm being completely honest, this began as a cathartic process that I needed to do; however, it has evolved and has gradually become a bit of a thing. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461531642/berlin2_zxn9nq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Now I am invited to perform my songs in art galleries, dive-bars and cabarets across Europe and Asia. The act works best in intimate environments where people can really engage with the subject matter. I am busy working with various musicians, producers and
 performance artists to produce a promo clip and an album of my music. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461531930/12716423_1041373072606598_7067354882840131718_o_qv3cq8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>There are many complex issues for male survivors of abuse. I am fortunate to have a strong support network of friends, other people aren't so lucky. It is my hope that sharing an authentic narrative that acknowledges all the negativity, while encouraging a positive outlook with just a touch of dark humour, can help to challenge many of the preconceived perceptions of abuse. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>To Do This I Need...<br/>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>To film a promo video clip for the demo track, ""Better Off Dead.""</b></li>
<li><b>To record session musicians.</b></li>
<li><b>To Pay for producers.</b></li>
<li><b>To Pay for professional mastering. </b></li>
</ul>On 28/04/2016, I will be filming a promo for the demo track, ""Better Off Dead,"" (<a href=""http://www.magicalmretour.com/#!my-songs/ck0q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Listen Here</a>). It has always been my philosophy to pay everyone involved in my projects. I have spent many years doing things for 'the experience' and this is always shit. I would rather cut back on props and costumes in order to make sure that everyone gets something for their time. We work with what we have. So the promo will cost: <br/>
<ul>
<li>Director/Cameraman/editor - 500 GBP</li>
<li>Makeup artist - 150 GBP</li>
<li>Venues for shoot, The Rag Factory, London - 100 GBP</li>
<li>3 x Drag performers -450 GBP</li>
<li>Props and costumes - 50 GBP</li>
</ul>
<h3>Total for the promo clip: 1250 GBP.</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461945297/betteroffdead_teaser_vtx5pa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>I have already recorded vocal tracks and basic arrangements for a further 12 songs. The sound I am looking for on the album is obviously much richer than my solo performances; however, I am still looking to maintain the gritty, unpolished aesthetic. <br/></p>
<p><b>Think Lou Reed on Crystal Meth meets John Grant on speed. </b><br/></p>
<p>At times it has the feel of 70's glam 'dad' rock (if your dad happened to be a trashy old queen), other times it can be quite synth driven, but who knows what might happen! Several studios and producers in Bristol, London and Berlin are interested in working on the recordings, mixing and mastering. The prices quoted to me range from 200 GBP a day to 700 GBP a day, depending on the studio, the producer or the musicians involved. <br/></p>
<p>I am very keen to keep costs to a minimum and complete as much of the project as possible within a week. <br/></p>
<p>I am aiming to produce 10 tracks in total in the UK. I can work quite fast. The target is an average of 3 tracks a day, with
 the mastering, I am looking at 5 days in the studio at an average of 500 GBP.<br/></p>
<h3><b>Total for 10 tracks: 2500 GBP.</b></h3>
<h3>In total, this whole project will cost me just 3750 GBP.</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1><b>Is this just another vanity project?</b></h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Not at all. It is true that there is a huge amount of creative content being made by professional performers and artists all around the world. However, the subject matter I deal with is often considered inappropriate by the mainstream creative industries. For example, the book I have written, ""A Year in Shorts,"" was banned in SE Asia where it was originally published. This is still such a difficult subject and even well educated people, such as Stephen Fry (<a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/stephen-fry-mind-responds-to-frys-comments-about-sexual-abuse-survivors-pitying-themselves-a6980321.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fry on The Ruben Report</a>), have a tendency to emasculate male survivors of sexual abuse and rape. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461683760/a_year_in_shorts_ec7rn5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>I have extensive experience writing and singing my songs and the feedback I get is very positive. I feel the mask puts me in a position to talk openly about certain aspects of male sexuality and abuse in an engaging and entertaining way. <br/>
</p>
<p></p>
</div>By doing this, I am making myself incredibly vulnerable. I have already weathered the obligatory onslaught of social media abuse, but I truly believe in what I am doing. I have been developing a strong body of work that is darkly comedic and does not profess to be artificially or academically objective; indeed, it is composed purely of subjective impressions. It has an authenticity that definitely resonates with some people. I do not pretend to speak for everyone, these are my experiences and I hope that this project has value and encourages debate.<br/><br/>I now have a simple website and platform on which to sell my music including itunes. Any profit that I make from this project will be invested in future creative endeavours. That's what I do. I am in the process of writing another book, as well as more songs. I'm even sketching a piece of musical theatre. Who knows where it will all end? I have already achieved so much more than I ever thought possible. <br/><br/>I thank everyone who has supported this project and offered creative input, constructive feedback and advice.<br/><br/>I thank everyone in the indiegogo community for making me feel that I can submit this proposal for your consideration. <br/><br/>I welcome all feedback and I am looking to put my work out to a much wider audience. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461945528/betteroffdead_teaser_gt84jr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/></div>","So why the 'Mr E'?

To Pay for producers.
To Pay for professional mastering. 
On 28/04/2016, I will be filming a promo for the demo track, ""Better Off Dead,"" (Listen Here). It has always been my philosophy to pay everyone involved in my projects. I have spent many years doing things for 'the experience' and this is always shit. I would rather cut back on props and costumes in order to make sure that everyone gets something for their time. We work with what we have. So the promo will cost: 

Director/Cameraman/editor - 500 GBP
Makeup artist - 150 GBP
Venues for shoot, The Rag Factory, London - 100 GBP
3 x Drag performers -450 GBP
Props and costumes - 50 GBP

Total for the promo clip: 1250 GBP.




I have already recorded vocal tracks and basic arrangements for a further 12 songs. The sound I am looking for on the album is obviously much richer than my solo performances; however, I am still looking to maintain the gritty, unpolished aesthetic. 
Think Lou Reed on Crystal Meth meets John Grant on speed. 
At times it has the feel of 70's glam 'dad' rock (if your dad happened to be a trashy old queen), other times it can be quite synth driven, but who knows what might happen! Several studios and producers in Bristol, London and Berlin are interested in working on the recordings, mixing and mastering. The prices quoted to me range from 200 GBP a day to 700 GBP a day, depending on the studio, the producer or the musicians involved. 
I am very keen to keep costs to a minimum and complete as much of the project as possible within a week. 
I am aiming to produce 10 tracks in total in the UK. I can work quite fast. The target is an average of 3 tracks a day, with
 the mastering, I am looking at 5 days in the studio at an average of 500 GBP.
Total for 10 tracks: 2500 GBP.
In total, this whole project will cost me just 3750 GBP.


Is this just another vanity project?

Not at all. It is true that there is a huge amount of creative content being made by professional performers and artists all around the world. However, the subject matter I deal with is often considered inappropriate by the mainstream creative industries. For example, the book I have written, ""A Year in Shorts,"" was banned in SE Asia where it was originally published. This is still such a difficult subject and even well educated people, such as Stephen Fry (Fry on The Ruben Report), have a tendency to emasculate male survivors of sexual abuse and rape. 


I have extensive experience writing and singing my songs and the feedback I get is very positive. I feel the mask puts me in a position to talk openly about certain aspects of male sexuality and abuse in an engaging and entertaining way. 


By doing this, I am making myself incredibly vulnerable. I have already weathered the obligatory onslaught of social media abuse, but I truly believe in what I am doing. I have been developing a strong body of work that is darkly comedic and does not profess to be artificially or academically objective; indeed, it is composed purely of subjective impressions. It has an authenticity that definitely resonates with some people. I do not pretend to speak for everyone, these are my experiences and I hope that this project has value and encourages debate.I now have a simple website and platform on which to sell my music including itunes. Any profit that I make from this project will be invested in future creative endeavours. That's what I do. I am in the process of writing another book, as well as more songs. I'm even sketching a piece of musical theatre. Who knows where it will all end? I have already achieved so much more than I ever thought possible. I thank everyone who has supported this project and offered creative input, constructive feedback and advice.I thank everyone in the indiegogo community for making me feel that I can submit this proposal for your consideration. I welcome all feedback and I am looking to put my work out to a much wider audience.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div>My name is Jeremiah Sammartano and I'm looking to get funds to get a new album recorded and released.

<div>For the new album, which is going to be called: <i>These Motel Days</i>, I'm asking for help with the sum of $3,000. This will cover the cost of the local studio time, getting CDs produced, a new batch of t-shirts with a new design, posters for upcoming tours in the new year (shows are already being booked and will continue to be booked), and some pay to the musicians helping me out. If I pass the $5,000 mark then I'll get a run of vinyl pressed up. As an indie and a DIY artist I'm always appreciative of any outside help.</div>
<div>I'm am looking forward to sharing this new album with everybody, and for helping out I do have some ""specials"" to share and pass along with different levels of contributions: demos of the album, older songs, the current t-shirt and the new one, postcards, prints of some of the photos that I have taken when traveling over these past years, house concert party - and of course, the new album.</div>
<div>If I don't happen to reach the desired goal, the album will still be completed - but it will just take a bit longer to be released. Right now I've set aside some time to record over this winter but if the goal isn't met it will be pushed back to the spring and then released ASAP.</div>

<p>We are a non-profit
cultural organization from the city of Ruse, Bulgaria in Eastern Europe. We
have successfully organized for 7 years the Green Rock Fest in Ruse - a
festival for young rock bands. The idea of the festival is to give a chance to
bands at the beginning of their career to perform their music and find friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450014906/gifga4ndpr8ktelweitw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Now we are heading towards a new challenge – to make young people
love jazz music and get acquainted with its richness and creative expression. </b></p>
<p><b>We would like with your support to give a chance for Halftone
Festival to happen in our community. </b></p>
<p>Our new project is related
to jazz music. Jazz festivals are held in different cities of our country but
usually well-known professionals take part in them. </p>
<p><b>There is no specialized
forum where young followers of jazz music can play. </b></p>
<p>That’s why we decided to
organize a festival which has the same form as the Green Rock Fest but for jazz
music. We hope to attract young people to that kind of music. In that way we
will counter the trend promoted by the commercial music companies of music
without thinking. Young musicians from our country Bulgaria and abroad will
perform at the Halftone festival. To attract audience, we will invite a world
famous star.</p>
<p><b>In order to let this happen we need <b>12000 USD</b> to cover our costs for organisation and participation of a famous artist.<br/></b></p>

We are a non-profit
cultural organization from the city of Ruse, Bulgaria in Eastern Europe. We
have successfully organized for 7 years the Green Rock Fest in Ruse - a
festival for young rock bands. The idea of the festival is to give a chance to
bands at the beginning of their career to perform their music and find friends.


That was the result which
we achieved with our Green Rock Fest.(Photo by Tsvetomir Tsvetanov)

The website of the rock festival is www.greenrockfestruse.com


Now we are heading towards a new challenge – to make young people
love jazz music and get acquainted with its richness and creative expression. 
We would like with your support to give a chance for Halftone
Festival to happen in our community. 
Our new project is related
to jazz music. Jazz festivals are held in different cities of our country but
usually well-known professionals take part in them. 
There is no specialized
forum where young followers of jazz music can play. 
That’s why we decided to
organize a festival which has the same form as the Green Rock Fest but for jazz
music. We hope to attract young people to that kind of music. In that way we
will counter the trend promoted by the commercial music companies of music
without thinking. Young musicians from our country Bulgaria and abroad will
perform at the Halftone festival. To attract audience, we will invite a world
famous star.
In order to let this happen we need 12000 USD to cover our costs for organisation and participation of a famous artist.




   What We Need & What You Get 
Your support will help us
to:
- 
Cover the costs for the
performing artists;
- 
Promote the festival to
the public and attract audience;
- 
Cover the organization
costs for sound and light equipment, rent of hall, consumables and recording.   
As we are very excited by this campaign, we would like to
express our gratitude to you by our perks which we have thought of especially
for you:
5 USD – beautiful personalized contributor e-diploma. The diploma will be designed by the young Bulgarian artist Sophia Karakusheva - the author of our logo. It will contain summary collage of the festival, also your name together with our thankful greetings. 
10 USD – the e-poster of the
festival. This will be the official poster of the festival signed by the guest musicians in an electronic variant;
25 USD - our special Valentine's perk - invitation for two for the event



35 USD – e-book – “Technical
Exercises for Guitar” by the big Bulgarian jazzman and guitarist Alexander
Petkov. Alexander Petkov has graduated from The Dresden Conservatory. He is the creator of one of the most important jazz schools in Bulgaria. The compositions , books and albums of Mr Petkov received brilliant reviews by world-class musicians like Robert ( Bob ) Conti , Joe Lano, Joe Diorio , Dusan Bogdanovic and Dale Zdenek ( publisher of Ted Greene and Joe Diorio). 

Its our honour that Mr. Petkov supports our campaign by giving us his e-books!

100 USD + Shipping – Hand-made wooden souvenir mini guitar - 9
centimeter replica of a real guitar by the craft master Dimitar Dancheff. Give the model of your favourite guitar and we will send you the little replica in a beautiful box!




150 USD + Shipping – a cartoon picture of
you or your friend or music/sports/cinema etc. idol drawn by the popular artist from our
town Ognyan Balkandzhiev. The size of the picture is A4 (8.27 × 11.69 inches). Give us your photos and explain your interests and we will send you an amazing cartoon!

<p>My name is Vince. Most who don't know me personally or I'm not friends with know me as <b><a href=""http://vincevandal.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vince Vandal</a></b>. So with that being said: Hi! My name's Vince Elder and I'm from Baltimore, Maryland. If I'm gonna be so bold as to ask for your financial support on a personal project, then it's only fair that you know a little bit about me, right?</p>
<p>First off, I’m most definitely what one would refer to as a ‘nerd.’ I collect graphic tees and Pop! figures (the latter is a new vice for me. Damn you, Harley Quinn), I watch anime and Doctor Who, I’m absolutely <i>obsessed</i> with video games, and I love going to conventions of all sizes. So much, in fact, that I actually ended up working for one, but that’s besides the point.</p>
<p>The point is, my major passion in life above all others is music. I could give up all those other things (even though you would have to drag me kicking and screaming away from my video games) but I definitely couldn’t live without music in my life. Hell, I’m writing this thing<i>right now</i> with earbuds in.</p>
<p>When I was very young I realized I had a talent for musical creation, making rock and hip-hop beats on my old Casio keyboards (you know the ones with that old school ‘Demo’ button? Yeeeeah, I saw you smile) and also re-creating some of my favorite songs and instrumentals. Well, I worked with what I had, anyway.</p>
<p>Over the years I made tons of music for the hell of it, just because it was fun. Then one day while riding around with a good friend of mine, he let me hear a song by some guy named <b><a href=""http://www.adamwarrock.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adam WarRock</a></b>, and the track was called “<i>Nightcrawlin’</i>.” That was the first time I’d ever heard of what is now known as <b>Nerdcore</b> — music of virtually any style or genre that focuses heavily on ‘nerdy’ foundations, be it comic books, sci-fi, anime, video games and everything in between. Until then I’d only heard your everyday, run-of-the-mill pop music, basically whatever you would hear commonly on the radio in the 90s. Nerdcore opened up a whole other world of music to me, because let’s face it, not all of us can relate to what it’s like being a gangsta.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/914/607/6b9bc68b93946597d42d3650522e4ecb_original.jpg?v=1447578671&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=b577f900ed5e97e63bf4ac7b39ff44f0"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><i>My first Nerdcore show in 2011: mc chris' Race Wars Tour. Sorry for the potato quality. &gt;_&gt;</i></p>
<p>Some time passed (I know this is mad long, sorry, I get carried away sometimes… haha) and one day I randomly decided to enter a beat-making <a href=""http://nerdyshow.com/contests/marvel-vs-capcom-3-on-3-mixtape-melee/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contest</a> hosted by<b> <a href=""http://www.nerdyshow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NerdyShow</a></b>. I’d like to say I won the contest (it was actually kinda complicated in the end, to be perfectly honest) but regardless, it led me to actually touch base with some of Nerdcore’s more talented hip-hop artists, the first of which turned out to be Adam WarRock who hit me up and asked me to produce an upcoming project for him. That project turned out to be his sophomore album and my first professional release, <b>“<a href=""http://adamwarrock.bandcamp.com/album/you-dare-call-that-thing-human"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You Dare Call That Thing Human?!?</a>”</b></p>
<div>
<p>So yeah, that’s the long and short of it (mostly long. Actually, all long) and how I came to get into this world I’m in. I’ve gone on to do many, many other projects with a bunch of different, amazing artists (some of which I’ll post throughout this page) and I definitely have no regrets. Every choice I’ve made has gotten me to where I am now.</p>
<p>...Kinda like a TellTale game.</p>
<h1>WHAT... IS YOUR QUEST?</h1>
<p>Ahhhh okay, I see where this is going. You think you’re slick.</p>
<p>Okay then, let’s do this. My quest is to bring nerdy, pop culture music to the forefront of the music world and let as many people as possible hear how absolutely incredible we can be when faced with a dope beat. You see, what we do is not just Nerdcore — it’s <i>so</i> much more than that.</p>
<p>I’ve been to a ton of shows that prominently feature nerdy music, from relatively high profile artists such as <b><a href=""http://www.mcchris.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mc chris</a></b>, <b><a href=""http://www.megaran.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Random aka Mega Ran</a></b> and <b><a href=""http://www.frontalot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MC Frontalot</a></b>, to people who are lower on the ‘known’ scale but <i>no</i> less talented and deserving of recognition such as <b><a href=""http://www.insaneian.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Insane Ian</a></b> or <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thenerdlucks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Nerdlucks</a></b>. All of these people are amazing at what they do, and I want to help showcase their skills. Through the help of various anime conventions, I have hosted a couple shows in the past which were decently received, but I want to branch off and do my own thing — without standing in the shadow of a convention telling me how to do it...</p>

<p>Regarding one of the previously mentioned convention shows I booked, everything was in place and the stage was all set to be what was sure to be a fantastic show. Easily one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of putting together. But unfortunately, as luck would have it this go-round, the show was abruptly <i>canceled</i> not 5-minutes into the first performer's set due to ""unforeseen circumstances"" (the con's words, not mine), much to the ire of everyone who was excited to see the show -- myself included.</p>
<h1>MAN... THAT SUCKS.</h1>
<p>It does. Certainly was the first time I've ever had a show canceled on me like that, and in such an unceremonious way, too. That said, there's no use staying salty about what happened. What's past is past, and we must move forward. But that doesn't mean that we just chalk that show-that-wasn't up as a loss. <b>We re-book it!</b> Bigger, and way better than it would have been, while simultaneously giving the fans one hell of an experience. So once more, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the preferred line-up (subject to schedules): </p>

<p>Four of the best artists --nerdy or otherwise-- to ever grab a microphone, and the proposed ""dream team"" for the kickoff show. But no matter what, there WILL be 4-6 incredible performers taking the stage, with the added bonus of a <b><i>BUNCH</i></b> of extras to make the show a truly memorable one!</p>
<h1>WHAT... IS YOUR PROJECT AND WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL?</h1>
<p>The Nerdy Pop Culture Music Festival, or <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Npcmusicfest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NPC Music Fest</a></b> for short, is my idea for a musical showcase for nerd music of all styles and genres to come together during a weekend and just have a great time. I make it my priority when working with artists to go above and beyond just booking a standard show. I try my best to make sure they’re having a good time, as well as everyone who took time out of their schedule and money out of their pocket to come see them. They helped bring me into this musical world, so in return I want to show them just how much I truly appreciate it. But I can’t do it the way I would like to without your help.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453409970/gnrxqvox9buovgjlf0qx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>On the surface, the NPC Music Fest is a day of awesome artists playing equally awesome music. But what I want to do for it in the long run is what makes it really unique. So many times I've heard people talk about other nerd-based festivals or conventions and complain that it would be awesome to attend, but it's clear across the country and their funds/time just won't allow for that kind of travel. So to remedy that, I want the NPC Music Fest to be the first ever (as far as I'm aware) <b>MOBILE</b> nerd music festival. Every year a new artist line-up, every year a new city. I want this to be one of the big shows that people wait all year to go to, then start planning to hit up the next one as soon as it ends. We will bring the music to you so you don't have to worry about pesky things like airfare or booking hotels unless you want to. </p>
<h1>WHAT... IS THE AIRSPEED VELOCITY OF AN UNLADEN SWALLOW?</h1>
<p>11 meters per second. Come at me.</p>
<h1>WHAT... ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL?</h1>
<p>If the NPC Music Fest gets off the ground and is a resounding success, and I <b><i>REALLY</i></b> hope that it is, then of course I want to see it grow. <b>The initial show is currently planned to be held in Virginia Beach, VA. </b>With the following show being in a different state entirely. Every dime that is earned by the show will go <i>back into</i> <i>the show</i>, because ideally I want this to be a yearly thing. Bigger shows, bigger venues (to accommodate the hopefully growing number of attendees), more days… I’m in this for the long haul, and I hope you’re willing to help turn what is currently a vivid dream of mine into what I promise to be an incredible reality.</p>
<p>Thank you all<b><i> so</i></b> much, and I hope to see you at the show.</p>

Four of the best artists --nerdy or otherwise-- to ever grab a microphone, and the proposed ""dream team"" for the kickoff show. But no matter what, there WILL be 4-6 incredible performers taking the stage, with the added bonus of a BUNCH of extras to make the show a truly memorable one!
WHAT... IS YOUR PROJECT AND WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL?
The Nerdy Pop Culture Music Festival, or NPC Music Fest for short, is my idea for a musical showcase for nerd music of all styles and genres to come together during a weekend and just have a great time. I make it my priority when working with artists to go above and beyond just booking a standard show. I try my best to make sure they’re having a good time, as well as everyone who took time out of their schedule and money out of their pocket to come see them. They helped bring me into this musical world, so in return I want to show them just how much I truly appreciate it. But I can’t do it the way I would like to without your help.


On the surface, the NPC Music Fest is a day of awesome artists playing equally awesome music. But what I want to do for it in the long run is what makes it really unique. So many times I've heard people talk about other nerd-based festivals or conventions and complain that it would be awesome to attend, but it's clear across the country and their funds/time just won't allow for that kind of travel. So to remedy that, I want the NPC Music Fest to be the first ever (as far as I'm aware) MOBILE nerd music festival. Every year a new artist line-up, every year a new city. I want this to be one of the big shows that people wait all year to go to, then start planning to hit up the next one as soon as it ends. We will bring the music to you so you don't have to worry about pesky things like airfare or booking hotels unless you want to. 
WHAT... IS THE AIRSPEED VELOCITY OF AN UNLADEN SWALLOW?
11 meters per second. Come at me.
WHAT... ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL?
If the NPC Music Fest gets off the ground and is a resounding success, and I REALLY hope that it is, then of course I want to see it grow. The initial show is currently planned to be held in Virginia Beach, VA. With the following show being in a different state entirely. Every dime that is earned by the show will go back into the show, because ideally I want this to be a yearly thing. Bigger shows, bigger venues (to accommodate the hopefully growing number of attendees), more days… I’m in this for the long haul, and I hope you’re willing to help turn what is currently a vivid dream of mine into what I promise to be an incredible reality.
Thank you all so much, and I hope to see you at the show.
-Vince
TL;DR: Gimme money and we'll make awesome, nerdy, musical magic happen. Trufax.



Risks and challengesAs this is a project that involves multiple people and many yet unknown factors, there may be hiccups and slight delays in the delivery of some rewards. But that's the worst case scenario. I promise that I will make sure everybody receives the things that they pledge for, because it's your money, your faith in me that I can make this happen, and you absolutely deserve it.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Originally established to cover songs by border composers from Texas, it eventually became its own creative project with the release of its debut album in 2011. The band made its name by performing an energetic fusion of border folk music with carribean influences.</span></p><p><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">""Frontera Buglaú plays raw, edgy socially conscious folk music that's danceable.

</blockquote><p>The unique fusion of button accordion, harp, piano, and clarinet, the music creates a connection between traditional border music, big city mambo and Caribbean music that swept through Mexico in the 30's. Drawing inspiration from musicians such as Cuban sonero Beny More and mambo master Perez Prado, the result is a unique sound, reflective of the underground “Pachuco” scene of El Paso and Juarez.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">*</span><a href=""http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/article/Reviving-bugal-1144881.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Read full article here</a><br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/article/Reviving-bugal-1144881.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3><b>Our Campaign:</b></h3><p>This project features two years of compositions, painstakingly put together by writers and later produced in studio. It's lyrics are stories from the Texas borderlands and its music represents the Latino heritage. <b>Despite our growing demographic in the country, very little original Latino music is being produced and made available to the public. </b>The high expense of producing an independent projec, in addition to the lack of resources available to Latino musicians in terms of time and space, are constant obstacles in the attempt to make a musical project reality.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3><b>Project cost breakdown:</b></h3><p>Frontera Bugalu started recording in late August of 2015 and has already invested thousands of dollars getting the project from the writing process to the studio. We are asking for an additional $6,000 to cover the mixing and mastering process, plus $4,000 to cover the printing and marketing of the release. Mixing and mastering engineers will bring the recording up to a professional sonic level, which is required for music distribution sites and radio play. The artwork and marketing allow the release to have a real chance of garnering regional and national attention.

Originally established to cover songs by border composers from Texas, it eventually became its own creative project with the release of its debut album in 2011. The band made its name by performing an energetic fusion of border folk music with carribean influences.""Frontera Buglaú plays raw, edgy socially conscious folk music that's danceable. The norteño influence is immediately evident.""
 -SA Current*
The unique fusion of button accordion, harp, piano, and clarinet, the music creates a connection between traditional border music, big city mambo and Caribbean music that swept through Mexico in the 30's. Drawing inspiration from musicians such as Cuban sonero Beny More and mambo master Perez Prado, the result is a unique sound, reflective of the underground “Pachuco” scene of El Paso and Juarez.*Read full article hereOur Campaign:This project features two years of compositions, painstakingly put together by writers and later produced in studio. It's lyrics are stories from the Texas borderlands and its music represents the Latino heritage. Despite our growing demographic in the country, very little original Latino music is being produced and made available to the public. The high expense of producing an independent projec, in addition to the lack of resources available to Latino musicians in terms of time and space, are constant obstacles in the attempt to make a musical project reality.Project cost breakdown:Frontera Bugalu started recording in late August of 2015 and has already invested thousands of dollars getting the project from the writing process to the studio. We are asking for an additional $6,000 to cover the mixing and mastering process, plus $4,000 to cover the printing and marketing of the release. Mixing and mastering engineers will bring the recording up to a professional sonic level, which is required for music distribution sites and radio play. The artwork and marketing allow the release to have a real chance of garnering regional and national attention. Investing this kind of money into the project will allow us to work with professional studio musicians, mixing and mastering engineers, and art designers, normally not available to low-budget productions. Your support will allow this two-year work-in-progress to have a real chance of being heard. If we were not to reach our goal, the money would go towards the mixing and mastering engineering process alone. This in turn will allow the album to be produced at a professional level, allowing us to enter festivals, receive radio play, and access to popular music distributions sites. Importance for the Latino community:It is crucial to support this kind of music at a time where many of the traditions in Latino music, some that took generations to develop, are being lost.

<b>""<i>Constellations</i>""
is a new powerful chamber opera by composer Efraín Amaya. It's inspired by the struggles of a displaced renowned artist and his family, during times of world conflict, and the power of Art to heal and transcend human suffering. </b>
</div><div>The fictional story is based on a period in the life of Joan Miró, the
internationally renowned Spanish painter, during his exile in Northern France
in the early days of World War II. It was at this time when he started the creation of his
well-known series of twenty-three gouaches, the <i>Constellations. </i>These works became a symbol of the power of art in
its pursuit of the elevation of the spirit, even at the peak of social crisis
and upheaval. </div><div>Amaya composed the music to a story and libretto written by
Susana Amundaraín, with whom he has collaborated in previous productions. Both writers empathize with the critical circumstances Miró and his family endured while away from their native country, which struggled under a ruthless dictatorship. <b>This
is the first time an opera will be premiered surrounding Miró's work and life</b>.  </div><div>
<p>The opera in its musical structure consists of three
singers, thirteen musicians, and a conductor. <b>This World Premiere performance
will be presented in concert form.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>“<i>As I reflected on their
particular situation back then, I realized it is a current and timeless tale of
uncertainty amongst families in search of safer places, and of a better life.
We tend to look for the spiritual in the midst of crisis, and we make our faith
stronger when a part of ourselves surrenders. Efraín and I have been married
for many years now, and we love to go into these collaborations for the sheer
pleasure of discovery and creation, but even more, for the excitement of
involving more artists, musicians, and of course, all those who are lovers of
the arts.” </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-Susana Amundaraín</span></p>

</div></span></div></div>","What's the Story? 
""Constellations""
is a new powerful chamber opera by composer Efraín Amaya. It's inspired by the struggles of a displaced renowned artist and his family, during times of world conflict, and the power of Art to heal and transcend human suffering. 
The fictional story is based on a period in the life of Joan Miró, the
internationally renowned Spanish painter, during his exile in Northern France
in the early days of World War II. It was at this time when he started the creation of his
well-known series of twenty-three gouaches, the Constellations. These works became a symbol of the power of art in
its pursuit of the elevation of the spirit, even at the peak of social crisis
and upheaval. Amaya composed the music to a story and libretto written by
Susana Amundaraín, with whom he has collaborated in previous productions. Both writers empathize with the critical circumstances Miró and his family endured while away from their native country, which struggled under a ruthless dictatorship. This
is the first time an opera will be premiered surrounding Miró's work and life.  
The opera in its musical structure consists of three
singers, thirteen musicians, and a conductor. This World Premiere performance
will be presented in concert form.

“As I reflected on their
particular situation back then, I realized it is a current and timeless tale of
uncertainty amongst families in search of safer places, and of a better life.
We tend to look for the spiritual in the midst of crisis, and we make our faith
stronger when a part of ourselves surrenders. Efraín and I have been married
for many years now, and we love to go into these collaborations for the sheer
pleasure of discovery and creation, but even more, for the excitement of
involving more artists, musicians, and of course, all those who are lovers of
the arts.” -Susana Amundaraín

<p></p>
<p><span>A Great Escape was designed to be exactly what it's named, an escape. It's really all about music and how it has helped so many people over time. Like when you're blasting your earphones in the car because someone won't stop asking what you plan on doing in the future. Or how after having an awful day you're drowning in tears but your favorite song comes on and suddenly everything's right in the world. Music is an escape and live music even more so.</span></p>
<p>With a strong rock music base, this event (in the summer of 2016) plans to celebrate live music and bring together established, touring artists and up-and-coming acts looking for experience in performing. We believe there is an incredible amount of talent looking for an audience.</p>
<p>All proceeds that aren't used to cover expenses will go towards the Save the Elephants Organization and CARE Organization (the event will be non-profit)!</p>

<p><span>Now it's all fun and games when you're talking about awesome stuff, but with big ideas come big prices! Of course as two students in high school wondering how they'll be able to pay for college next year, we have a total combined savings of about $24.22 in our pockets (maybe a piece of lint or gum too), half of which we borrowed from our parents... THIS is where we need your help, in order to make this come true, we are asking for your support to fund our project.  Whether you can afford to help out with $5 to $10,000, any donation is absolutely generous and we will be forever grateful for your help. Of course, we would like to make a festival big enough to give Coachella a run for its money, but no matter what we are able to raise, we are committed to our goal of making our very own music festival in San Diego.</span></p>

</div></div>","Summary 

A Great Escape was designed to be exactly what it's named, an escape. It's really all about music and how it has helped so many people over time. Like when you're blasting your earphones in the car because someone won't stop asking what you plan on doing in the future. Or how after having an awful day you're drowning in tears but your favorite song comes on and suddenly everything's right in the world. Music is an escape and live music even more so.
With a strong rock music base, this event (in the summer of 2016) plans to celebrate live music and bring together established, touring artists and up-and-coming acts looking for experience in performing. We believe there is an incredible amount of talent looking for an audience.
All proceeds that aren't used to cover expenses will go towards the Save the Elephants Organization and CARE Organization (the event will be non-profit)!


Funding

Now it's all fun and games when you're talking about awesome stuff, but with big ideas come big prices! Of course as two students in high school wondering how they'll be able to pay for college next year, we have a total combined savings of about $24.22 in our pockets (maybe a piece of lint or gum too), half of which we borrowed from our parents... THIS is where we need your help, in order to make this come true, we are asking for your support to fund our project.  Whether you can afford to help out with $5 to $10,000, any donation is absolutely generous and we will be forever grateful for your help. Of course, we would like to make a festival big enough to give Coachella a run for its money, but no matter what we are able to raise, we are committed to our goal of making our very own music festival in San Diego.
Our Indiegogo funds would go towards:
- Renting a Venue
- Services and Set-Up/Clean-Up
-Artist Expenses
-Logistics Materials
-Legal Aspects
-Security
-Transportation Expenses
-Promotion Material

</div><div>
<p></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">Bonjour, je m'appelle Valerie Whissell et je suis l'humain derrière le Projet ITs Ok.     </p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">M</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">on aventure ITs Ok a commencé il y a quelques années alors que je souffrais de dépression. Pendant cette période où j’avais de la difficulté à passer à travers mes journées, j’écrivais « ITs Ok » sur mon bras pour demeurer dans un état d’esprit positif. En route vers la santé et une meilleure acceptation de moi, ces deux mots m’ont toujours suivie.</span>
</div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Depuis 2013, j’explore des manières de propager des messages positifs et inspirants dans la vie des gens en utilisant l’art et les produits dérivés pour les rejoindre. Cela a mené à la naissance du projet ITs Ok en 2014. J’ai par la suite participé à plusieurs festivals d’art et collaboré avec des organismes sans but lucratif québécois.</span></div><div>
<p>Cet hiver, je ressens le besoin d’aller propager la vibe ITs Ok en Europe!</p>
<h3>Les Messages ITs Ok</h3>
<p><b>ITs OK d’être soi-même. </b></p>
<p><b>ITs OK de vivre tes rêves. </b></p>
<p><b>ITs OK d’être ton propre héros. </b></p>
<p>Trop de gens souffrent de dépression, d’anxiété, de dépendances et de faible estime de soi. Avec les bons outils et entourés de personnes qui célèbrent le héros en nous, il est possible de retrouver la paix intérieure et d'apprendre à s’aimer. Selon moi, le chemin vers la paix dans le monde s’ouvre ainsi, puisque c’est en acceptant qui nous sommes et en nous permettant de réaliser nos rêves que nous pourrons offrir le meilleur de soi et créer un meilleur futur pour les gens autour.</p>
<p>Lors de mon passage en Europe, je souhaite rappeler aux gens à quel point l’acceptation de soi et un état d’esprit positif sont essentiels à l'épanouissement collectif. Dans cette optique, je vais entre autres concevoir des pochoirs ITs Ok en français et en allemand inspirés des personnes et des villes que je croiserai sur ma route. Ces pochoirs serviront à laisser des traces des messages ITs Ok un peu partout en Europe.</p>
<p>Mais… en quoi consiste donc cette aventure en Europe?</p>
<h3>La quête ITs Ok en Europe</h3>
<p>Vivons-nous entièrement et véritablement? Est-il possible que nous transformions nos peurs en embrassant directement l’incertitude qu’elles nous font ressentir? Comment pouvons-nous mieux écouter notre guide intérieur? Pouvons-nous nous ouvrir aux connexions humaines en dépit de la violence et de la destruction qui se produisent dans le monde?</p>
<p><b>30 jours. 3 pays. 1 but. </b></p>
<p>En février, alors que je visiterai la France, la Belgique et l’Allemagne pour partager la vibe ITs Ok, je me lancerai dans une quête de réponses à ces grandes questions de la vie. Lorsque je pense aux récents débats en lien avec le mariage homosexuel en France ainsi qu’aux attaques terroristes de novembre dernier, je sens un puissant besoin d’aller planter des graines d’amour en Europe. À ma façon, je souhaite ainsi tenter de faire de notre monde un meilleur endroit où vivre.</p>
<p>Grâce aux produits ITs Ok (autocollants, tatouages temporaires, aimants, etc.), à l’art urbain et aux rencontres que je ferai, je propagerai l’énergie ITs Ok et la dirigerai vers ceux qui en ont le plus besoin! D’ailleurs, j’essaie présentement de bâtir un canal de collaboration avec un organisme sans but lucratif européen travaillant avec et pour les communautés LGBTQ (lesbiennes, gaies, bisexuelles, trans et queers). Je veux partager mon histoire pour aider ceux qui ont de la difficulté à s’accepter tels qu’ils sont et, du même coup, les inspirer à s'exprimer par l'entremise de l'art.</p>
<p>J’apporterai une caméra afin de capter mes rencontres en images et de rapporter l’expérience du projet ITs Ok en Europe au Québec à mon retour, entre autres pour diffuser le contenu dans des écoles et des organismes. Pendant mon séjour, je mettrai également des vidéos hebdomadairement en ligne pour que vous puissiez vivre les moments ITs Ok avec moi.</p>
<p>À travers ce voyage, j’aimerais développer une meilleure compréhension de la peur qui construit et influence les sociétés que nous connaissons et les valeurs étroites qui guident bien souvent nos comportements.</p>
<h3>La magie des rencontres</h3>
<p>Lors de mes voyages aux États-Unis et de mes participations à différents festivals d’art avec le projet ITs Ok, j’ai eu la chance de parler des obstacles de la vie et d’acceptation de soi avec plusieurs personnes inspirantes. J’ai envie de vivre ce genre de moments humains en France, en Belgique et en Allemagne. J’ai vu à quel point la vibe ITs Ok et des moments de partage véritables pouvaient éclairer la vie des gens et les ouvrir à l’inconnu. Je le sais parce que je le vis moi aussi lors de ces rencontres.</p>
<p>À de nombreuses reprises, des gens m’ont écrit pour me dire que les autocollants ITs Ok les aidaient à garder espoir dans des moments plus difficiles de leur vie. C’est pourquoi je veux maintenant explorer le potentiel des messages ITs Ok en Europe et voir l’impact qu’ils auront sur les gens avec qui je ferai connaissance.</p>
<p>Afin de connecter avec des Français, des Belges et des Allemands et d’ajouter un peu d’énergie ITs Ok à leur quotidien, je ferai du couchsurfing et j’utiliserai autant que possible le covoiturage pour me déplacer. Mes billets d’avion sont achetés et certains de mes arrêts sont déjà déterminés, mais je vais aussi me laisser guider par le moment présent et les rencontres qui composeront ma visite en continent européen.</p>
<b><h3>Les détails du budget</h3></b><p>Grâce à l’incroyable soutien dont j’ai bénéficié lors de ma participation à différents marchés de Noël au Québec, j’ai pu payer mes billets d’avion pour l’Europe. Cependant, j’ai besoin de plus de fonds pour couvrir mes dépenses de voyage sur le terrain et me permettre d’apporter du matériel audiovisuel, des fournitures d’art et des produits ITs OK. Je compte mettre plus de 1000 produits ITs Ok dans mes bagages (autocollants, tatouages temporaires, aimants, etc.) afin de les distribuer tout au long de mon voyage, ainsi que 50 mini-toiles à créer et à partager sur la route. Pour accomplir tout cela, j’ai besoin d’un minimum de 2000 $.</p>
<p>De plus, j’ai encore à ce stade-ci le rêve de partir avec un vidéaste professionnel pour transformer l’aventure en documentaire. Si, ensemble, nous atteignons 3500$, ce rêve est accessible! Nous pouvons y arriver! Bien sûr, sans vidéaste, je ferai tout en mon pouvoir pour capter des images du voyage inspirantes à partager avec vous pendant mon passage en Europe et à mon retour.</p>
<p>Peu importe ce qu’il adviendra, je serai plus que reconnaissante de la générosité et du soutien que vous démontrez envers le projet ITs Ok en Europe.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">Hi, my name is Valerie Whissell and I'm the founder of the ITs Ok Project. My ITs Ok journey all started a few years ago as i was struggling with depression. During that period when I was having a rough time getting through the day I would write ITs Ok on my arm to keep myself focused on a positive state of mind. Along my way to recovery &amp; through my journey of self acceptance, these two words never left me. Since 2013, I've been exploring ways to spread positive &amp; empowering messages in people's lives by using art &amp; products as my way to reach out to people. This gave birth to the ITs Ok project in 2014. Since then i've participated in different art festivals &amp; collaborated with several non profit organizations. This winter, I feel the need to spread the ITs Ok vibe in Europe!</span></h3>

<p><b>ITs Ok to be yourself. ITs Ok To live your dreams. ITs Ok to Be Your Own Hero.</b> Too many people are suffering with depression, anxiety, addiction &amp; lack of self worth. With the right tools &amp; by surrounding ourselves with people who celebrate our truth, it is possible to find peace within &amp; to learn to love ourselves. I believe the road to world peace starts by embracing who we are &amp; allowing ourselves to live our dreams. May we become the Heros of our lives by allowing ourselves to speak our truth<b>.</b></p>
<p>During my stay in Europe, I want to remind people of the importance of self acceptance &amp; cultivating a positive state of mind. With this intention, I will be creating ITs OK stencil messages in French &amp; in German inspired by the beautiful encounters &amp; the cities i will be visiting. </p></span></div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The empowering effect of Human Connection</h3>
<p>During my past travels in the United States &amp; experiences in art festivals with The ITs Ok Project, I got to have beautiful human conversations with people about life, struggles, self acceptance &amp; living more consciously. I want to bring forth these human to human conversations in France, Belgium &amp; Germany this February. I have seen how the ITs Ok vibe &amp; these shared moments had a powerful enlighting effect on people. On me too. I also have had several people writing to let me know that the ITs Ok stickers were helping them cultivate hope &amp; light during life struggles. I'm curious to see how the ITs Ok vibe will be received in Europe!</p>
<p><b>With this sole intention to connect with Europeens &amp; spread the ITs Ok vibe directly in people's lives,</b> i will be couch surfing my way &amp; traveling using ride-sharing organizations. Though my plane tickets are booked &amp; i do have a few places mapped out. I want to go with the flow of living the present moment &amp; let the beautiful encounters lead me through this ITs Ok journey of life in Europe. </p>
<h3>To spread the ITs Ok vibe together</h3>
<p><b>The beauty of this campaign is that not only are you helping me go to Europe to spread the ITs Ok vibe, but with the rewards you also get to share it your way</b>. For i believe that it's together that we can truly make a difference in this world one ITs Ok at a time! To top it all, when i come back to Canada I also intend to visit schools  &amp; non profits organizations to share my experience of the ITs OK Project in Europe. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

Le Projet ITs Ok, c'est quoi?






Bonjour, je m'appelle Valerie Whissell et je suis l'humain derrière le Projet ITs Ok.     
Mon aventure ITs Ok a commencé il y a quelques années alors que je souffrais de dépression. Pendant cette période où j’avais de la difficulté à passer à travers mes journées, j’écrivais « ITs Ok » sur mon bras pour demeurer dans un état d’esprit positif. En route vers la santé et une meilleure acceptation de moi, ces deux mots m’ont toujours suivie.
Depuis 2013, j’explore des manières de propager des messages positifs et inspirants dans la vie des gens en utilisant l’art et les produits dérivés pour les rejoindre. Cela a mené à la naissance du projet ITs Ok en 2014. J’ai par la suite participé à plusieurs festivals d’art et collaboré avec des organismes sans but lucratif québécois.
Cet hiver, je ressens le besoin d’aller propager la vibe ITs Ok en Europe!
Les Messages ITs Ok
ITs OK d’être soi-même. 
ITs OK de vivre tes rêves. 
ITs OK d’être ton propre héros. 
Trop de gens souffrent de dépression, d’anxiété, de dépendances et de faible estime de soi. Avec les bons outils et entourés de personnes qui célèbrent le héros en nous, il est possible de retrouver la paix intérieure et d'apprendre à s’aimer. Selon moi, le chemin vers la paix dans le monde s’ouvre ainsi, puisque c’est en acceptant qui nous sommes et en nous permettant de réaliser nos rêves que nous pourrons offrir le meilleur de soi et créer un meilleur futur pour les gens autour.
Lors de mon passage en Europe, je souhaite rappeler aux gens à quel point l’acceptation de soi et un état d’esprit positif sont essentiels à l'épanouissement collectif. Dans cette optique, je vais entre autres concevoir des pochoirs ITs Ok en français et en allemand inspirés des personnes et des villes que je croiserai sur ma route. Ces pochoirs serviront à laisser des traces des messages ITs Ok un peu partout en Europe.
Mais… en quoi consiste donc cette aventure en Europe?
La quête ITs Ok en Europe
Vivons-nous entièrement et véritablement? Est-il possible que nous transformions nos peurs en embrassant directement l’incertitude qu’elles nous font ressentir? Comment pouvons-nous mieux écouter notre guide intérieur? Pouvons-nous nous ouvrir aux connexions humaines en dépit de la violence et de la destruction qui se produisent dans le monde?
30 jours. 3 pays. 1 but. 
En février, alors que je visiterai la France, la Belgique et l’Allemagne pour partager la vibe ITs Ok, je me lancerai dans une quête de réponses à ces grandes questions de la vie. Lorsque je pense aux récents débats en lien avec le mariage homosexuel en France ainsi qu’aux attaques terroristes de novembre dernier, je sens un puissant besoin d’aller planter des graines d’amour en Europe. À ma façon, je souhaite ainsi tenter de faire de notre monde un meilleur endroit où vivre.
Grâce aux produits ITs Ok (autocollants, tatouages temporaires, aimants, etc.), à l’art urbain et aux rencontres que je ferai, je propagerai l’énergie ITs Ok et la dirigerai vers ceux qui en ont le plus besoin! D’ailleurs, j’essaie présentement de bâtir un canal de collaboration avec un organisme sans but lucratif européen travaillant avec et pour les communautés LGBTQ (lesbiennes, gaies, bisexuelles, trans et queers). Je veux partager mon histoire pour aider ceux qui ont de la difficulté à s’accepter tels qu’ils sont et, du même coup, les inspirer à s'exprimer par l'entremise de l'art.
J’apporterai une caméra afin de capter mes rencontres en images et de rapporter l’expérience du projet ITs Ok en Europe au Québec à mon retour, entre autres pour diffuser le contenu dans des écoles et des organismes. Pendant mon séjour, je mettrai également des vidéos hebdomadairement en ligne pour que vous puissiez vivre les moments ITs Ok avec moi.
À travers ce voyage, j’aimerais développer une meilleure compréhension de la peur qui construit et influence les sociétés que nous connaissons et les valeurs étroites qui guident bien souvent nos comportements.
La magie des rencontres
Lors de mes voyages aux États-Unis et de mes participations à différents festivals d’art avec le projet ITs Ok, j’ai eu la chance de parler des obstacles de la vie et d’acceptation de soi avec plusieurs personnes inspirantes. J’ai envie de vivre ce genre de moments humains en France, en Belgique et en Allemagne. J’ai vu à quel point la vibe ITs Ok et des moments de partage véritables pouvaient éclairer la vie des gens et les ouvrir à l’inconnu. Je le sais parce que je le vis moi aussi lors de ces rencontres.
À de nombreuses reprises, des gens m’ont écrit pour me dire que les autocollants ITs Ok les aidaient à garder espoir dans des moments plus difficiles de leur vie. C’est pourquoi je veux maintenant explorer le potentiel des messages ITs Ok en Europe et voir l’impact qu’ils auront sur les gens avec qui je ferai connaissance.
Afin de connecter avec des Français, des Belges et des Allemands et d’ajouter un peu d’énergie ITs Ok à leur quotidien, je ferai du couchsurfing et j’utiliserai autant que possible le covoiturage pour me déplacer. Mes billets d’avion sont achetés et certains de mes arrêts sont déjà déterminés, mais je vais aussi me laisser guider par le moment présent et les rencontres qui composeront ma visite en continent européen.
Les détails du budgetGrâce à l’incroyable soutien dont j’ai bénéficié lors de ma participation à différents marchés de Noël au Québec, j’ai pu payer mes billets d’avion pour l’Europe. Cependant, j’ai besoin de plus de fonds pour couvrir mes dépenses de voyage sur le terrain et me permettre d’apporter du matériel audiovisuel, des fournitures d’art et des produits ITs OK. Je compte mettre plus de 1000 produits ITs Ok dans mes bagages (autocollants, tatouages temporaires, aimants, etc.) afin de les distribuer tout au long de mon voyage, ainsi que 50 mini-toiles à créer et à partager sur la route. Pour accomplir tout cela, j’ai besoin d’un minimum de 2000 $.
De plus, j’ai encore à ce stade-ci le rêve de partir avec un vidéaste professionnel pour transformer l’aventure en documentaire. Si, ensemble, nous atteignons 3500$, ce rêve est accessible! Nous pouvons y arriver! Bien sûr, sans vidéaste, je ferai tout en mon pouvoir pour capter des images du voyage inspirantes à partager avec vous pendant mon passage en Europe et à mon retour.
Peu importe ce qu’il adviendra, je serai plus que reconnaissante de la générosité et du soutien que vous démontrez envers le projet ITs Ok en Europe.

(English)
 The ITs Ok Project
Hi, my name is Valerie Whissell and I'm the founder of the ITs Ok Project. My ITs Ok journey all started a few years ago as i was struggling with depression. During that period when I was having a rough time getting through the day I would write ITs Ok on my arm to keep myself focused on a positive state of mind. Along my way to recovery & through my journey of self acceptance, these two words never left me. Since 2013, I've been exploring ways to spread positive & empowering messages in people's lives by using art & products as my way to reach out to people. This gave birth to the ITs Ok project in 2014. Since then i've participated in different art festivals & collaborated with several non profit organizations. This winter, I feel the need to spread the ITs Ok vibe in Europe!

The ITs Ok Quest in Europe. 

Are we living fully & with authenticity? Is it possible for us to follow our fears by embracing uncertainty & listening to our inner guidance? Can we open ourselves to human connections despite all the violence & destructive events happening in our world? 

 30 Days. 3 countries. 1 Goal.

This February I'm on a quest to answer life's big questions as I will be off to spread the ITs Ok vibe in Europe. I will be visiting France, Belgium & Germany. With marriage equality that brought up a lot of commotion in France the past few years & in response to the recent terrorist attacks, I feel called to plant seeds of love in Europe and try to make this world a better place in my own way. With the help of the ITs Ok products (stickers, temporary tattoos & magnets) and through street art interventions & human connections, I will be spreading the ITs Ok vibe with those who might need it! I'm also currently seeking to collaborate with a non profit organization related to the LGBT community & share my story to help those who are struggling with self acceptance. All in all, I want to have a better understanding of the fear that we are constantly cultivating in our society & in our personal limiting beliefs. I'm bringing a camera along so I can capture & bring the ITs Ok in Europe experience back home in schools & non profit organizations. I will also be doing a weekly video blog as I journey through Europe to share my ITs OK Moments with you. 

The Messages
ITs Ok to be yourself. ITs Ok To live your dreams. ITs Ok to Be Your Own Hero. Too many people are suffering with depression, anxiety, addiction & lack of self worth. With the right tools & by surrounding ourselves with people who celebrate our truth, it is possible to find peace within & to learn to love ourselves. I believe the road to world peace starts by embracing who we are & allowing ourselves to live our dreams. May we become the Heros of our lives by allowing ourselves to speak our truth.
During my stay in Europe, I want to remind people of the importance of self acceptance & cultivating a positive state of mind. With this intention, I will be creating ITs OK stencil messages in French & in German inspired by the beautiful encounters & the cities i will be visiting. 


The empowering effect of Human Connection
During my past travels in the United States & experiences in art festivals with The ITs Ok Project, I got to have beautiful human conversations with people about life, struggles, self acceptance & living more consciously. I want to bring forth these human to human conversations in France, Belgium & Germany this February. I have seen how the ITs Ok vibe & these shared moments had a powerful enlighting effect on people. On me too. I also have had several people writing to let me know that the ITs Ok stickers were helping them cultivate hope & light during life struggles. I'm curious to see how the ITs Ok vibe will be received in Europe!
With this sole intention to connect with Europeens & spread the ITs Ok vibe directly in people's lives, i will be couch surfing my way & traveling using ride-sharing organizations. Though my plane tickets are booked & i do have a few places mapped out. I want to go with the flow of living the present moment & let the beautiful encounters lead me through this ITs Ok journey of life in Europe. 
To spread the ITs Ok vibe together
The beauty of this campaign is that not only are you helping me go to Europe to spread the ITs Ok vibe, but with the rewards you also get to share it your way. For i believe that it's together that we can truly make a difference in this world one ITs Ok at a time! To top it all, when i come back to Canada I also intend to visit schools  & non profits organizations to share my experience of the ITs OK Project in Europe.

<p>Live music. It’s what we love. How about you? The energy, the passion, the feeling we get when the right chords come together in just ""that"" way invoking feelings and memories like nothing else.

<p>At Strumsy we want to make it better for venues, bands and fans. Easier for fans to find bands they’ll like, easier for them to explore music that they haven’t listened to, easier for everyone to get what they love out of a night’s live music, easier for venues who support live music to be <b>the </b>choice destination for people on their nights out.</p>
<p>Our goal has been to <b>DO</b> something. We can't play a lick of music, but we realized that we COULD do something to promote live music, and make it better for everyone involved; from venues to buskers, local solo acts to bigger, nationwide performing acts. Supporting LIVE music, and especially live music by a local talent right down the street; was our foundational goal.</p>
<p>So, we started Strumsy to achieve those goals, and have produced the premier platform for gigging bands to build followers, be found, and distribute their show schedule to the widest audience with the fewest steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>
We have implemented the first dynamic request/tipping platform using new software engines so that the bands know <b>real-time</b> what their fans want to hear.<br/>
</li>
<li>
We have state-of-the-art geolocation features, so fans can dynamically locate shows near them, and get to the details of the show.<br/>
</li>
<li>
We have deployed both Android and iOS applications designed for the Bands to monitor incoming requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The feature list goes on, and the platform is fully functioning. So, you may ask, why crowdfunding?</p>

But, what we're asking for your help to do is develop the platform...

Software We Need to Develop

We've already come so far, and as with any software there are many ways to make it work better toward the ultimate goal. You can help to make live music a viable option for venues and musicians and support a struggling art form.
For Bands this includes:

Ease of Use Refinements (making the flow super simple).
Maximize the platform-included promotional APIs so that the greatest number of people will hear about a show, and anybody who is looking for it, can find it.
We want to be the center of the spokes; enter the show on Strumsy and it will be visible on as many platforms as possible on which the band would otherwise painstakingly have to spend time entering details over and over.

Leveraging our online-promotion tools so that people can easily find their location and see who's playing.
Integrate promotions or incentives the venues make available to enhance marketing efforts and ensure the longevity of Strumsy as a platform.
We want to refine the definitive ""live music"" venue database. If you host live music at your place, we want you to be listed on our site.

For Fans this includes:

Providing mobile apps that streamline the live music experience; from finding the shows to requesting songs (if a band takes requests), to tipping the band with a simple-to-use interface, assured that the artist is getting the lion's share of the tip.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>The Royal Pitches is an All-Female A Cappella group from The University at Buffalo. 15 incredibly talented girls who come together to do what they love: sing. In the past we've sang for President Barack Obama, former Senator Hillary Clinton, and amazing singer, John Legend! The Royal Pitches have been around since 1996, and our most recent album, ""Nobody's Pitch"", came out in 2013. The Pitches have come a long way in just three years, and we'd like to show the world our amazing new sound!

The Royal Pitches is an All-Female A Cappella group from The University at Buffalo. 15 incredibly talented girls who come together to do what they love: sing. In the past we've sang for President Barack Obama, former Senator Hillary Clinton, and amazing singer, John Legend! The Royal Pitches have been around since 1996, and our most recent album, ""Nobody's Pitch"", came out in 2013. The Pitches have come a long way in just three years, and we'd like to show the world our amazing new sound!

<div>In 2012, I was approaching my 40th birthday and feeling like I'd hit a concrete wall. So, my restless spirit and I mustered up enough courage to begin living a more authentic life (or at least I was on the hunt to find out what that meant to me). I sold and gave away most of my possessions and began a life of full-time travel. Travelling over the unplanned course of 3 ½  years, living like a local in parts of the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Scotland and Portugal, I experienced a deeper understanding of people, culture, nature and our world. </div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Cody Joe Hodges.  I am a Texas based country recording artist.  You might know me from my recent radio releases, ""Getting Back to Country"", ""One More Drink"" and ""Hellbent On Loving You"".  This past year I was named the 2016 Male Rising Star from the Country Music Association of Texas.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474601940/tb95jjzt9fvrazdd85en.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For those that don't know me, I started playing music at an early age, but it wasn’t until my senior year in high school that I became serious about my art.  Impassioned by country greats from the 70's and 80's, I wrote my first song, “Daddy’s Dream”, my freshman year in the dorms at Texas A&amp;M University. </p>
<p>Not long after graduating from A&amp;M in 2006, I decided to take off for Nashville without a job, place to stay or even a friend.  As luck would have it, I ended up renting a place to stay with Jay Andrews, the steel guitar player for Johnny Paycheck.  After a short stay in Nashville, I decided to move back to Texas, take a break from music, and joined the Army.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474601594/g0js0l04uwiohmstnik3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>While in the Army, (duty station, Fort Carson), I was playing music with a homeless man on a street corner in Colorado Springs, and was approached by someone out of the crowd.  I was then asked to audition for one of the Army's music groups, ""Harmony in Motion,"" a vocal ensemble based out of Fort Carson, Colorado.  After auditioning with ""The National Anthem"" and an original tune, ""Daddy's Dream"", they extended an offer for me to join them.  I then began traveling across America playing for large entertainment venues and private military events.  </p>

<p>Upon discharge, Dad had a talk with me about a career in the power line business (as a lineman). This sounded like something exciting and also a great opportunity to draw upon for songwriting, so I joined the energy field in 2010.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2013, I decided to exit out of the power line business and focus energy on my music as a solo artist, putting faith in whatever plans God had for me.  So far it has been a blessing, with my first recording contract signed in Dec. ’13 (Tate Music Group - Oklahoma).  I released ""The Good Stuff"" album in November 2014, in which 6 songs I co-wrote with my wife, Jamie.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474601896/ck9oucoadz1ykspkuiak.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 2014, I teamed up with Lamon Records, a Sony independent label out of Nashville, to record my next project, a four song EP entitled ""One More Drink"".  The EP was released May 5, 2015, along with  the EP's titled single, ""One More Drink"" (co-written with Jamie) and a music video. </p>

<p>For those that know me, God and family are most important to me, and what better way to honor them both than with a Christmas album?  I have always dreamed of recording a Christmas album, and I finally was offered the opportunity to make this happen.  This album is very special to me.  Not only does it contain several of my favorite Christmas songs growing up, but it also contains three original songs written by my wife, Jamie, and myself.</p>
<p>As some of you know, recording, producing, distributing and marketing an album of any sort takes a lot of time and resources.  I am also aware that in this day and age, releasing a Christmas album might not be the ""cool"" or most ""PC"" thing to do, but this is what I am about - God, family and country.  I am honored to have the opportunity to share this album with you, and for you to take an active role in it's success.  Thanks so much for your support and God bless.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you are like me, I love Christmas music.  Whenever I hear the first Christmas song of the year, I immediately feel nostalgic, reflecting on Christmas' of the past.  Christmas to me is so special - a time for friends, family and praise.  It is also a time for generosity and appreciation for all mankind.  I love hearing stories of people ""paying it forward"" during the holidays.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474602422/q5yelze6hsbhkx9yjw4v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Of course, Christmas is not possible without Christ.  So I am eternally grateful for all He has provided.  My first radio release, ""Getting Back to Country"" hit the Top 25 of the Texas charts, #12 on the International charts and #1 on the Fan-Voted Chart (the first Texas artist to reach #1 since the charts inception in 1998).  My second release, ""One More Drink"", hit #1 on the International charts and also won the Country Single and Country Video by the Akademia Awards.  My most recent single, ""Hellbent On Loving You"" is still currently climbing the Music Row charts (6 weeks in the top 75) and Texas charts.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, this is our second ""go"" at crowdfunding.  My first attempt was prior to the release of my first album, ""The Good Stuff"", my EP, ""One More Drink"", and the release of any of the radio singles.  Now that I have a broader fan base, and more people who are (hopefully) familiar with my music, I think we can make this campaign a huge success.  I appreciate your help in making it a success, and think it will offer some great items that you can keep for yourself or, since it is the ""season of giving"", give to your family and friends.</p>

<p>Hello! I am a German violin soloist, composer, performer, poet and professor of violin and chamber music in South Korea. </p>
<p>A keen interest of my musical research is how and if daily life can be integrated into a musical form.</p>
<p>Are you aware of your personal ""symphony"" each day? How do you wake up? Accompanied by words, with the buzz of your tooth brush or with the sound of drinking some tea or water? Do you listen to birds or do you have to listen to the noise of cars? Or do you listen to your inner voice praying for a fulfilled day? Right – these are the themes and motifs of your daily ""symphony"", varying each day and depending on your activities, environment, team or the humans you interact with. It depends on the sounds we listen to and the kind of thoughts in our heads and hearts. Life is full of sound and noise, which also means, we´re surrounded by lots of information!</p>
<p>What is sound? Vibrations in the air, getting through our ears to our auditory cortex, ""translated"" via nerve cells into sound, which leads to positive and negative emotions. Previously music theorists divided sound into consonances or dissonances but these times have changed drastically. Our body is comprised of a complex system of nerve cells and we are actually a system of mainly water and „cell function“ through electrical signals. An atmosphere with too many external acoustical and electro-magnetical vibrations such as noise from traffic, industry, complex satellite systems, high frequency oceanic tests e.g. are all interfering with our body and the bodies of all living beings.</p>

<p>I spent my childhood in the Bavarian Forest, a geological  laboratory, very idyllic. During high-school  I studied with a Russian music and violin professor, a walking encyclopedia. I also liked subjects like maths, natural sciences, sports, languages, singing, the fine arts, dance. As a person I have synesthetical perception which means combination of auditive &amp; visual phenomena at the same time and also have perfect pitch. </p>
<p>Throughout my life I have been fascinated by the violin as ""the most perfect thing made by humans - even beating the computer"" - a beautiful small, light instrument from wood, a hobby or passion - you do not need any plug ins for ;-).</p>
<p>Music is my ""(love) letter"" to this world. In order to focus on practice or composition I need the power of silence and calmness as source of creativity. Descartes said: Movement in calmness and calmness in movement. A principle from the baroque time which Johann S. Bach was inspired by. </p>
<p>After having played many concerts in Europe, the US, South America, Middle East and Asia, and having taught many students from all over the world I have released two CDs in 2015 with a wide range of musical styles for violin and own compositions. </p>
<p>The following recording will be the continuation of the albums before which means classical music in dialogue with my own musical research as a composer. Enjoy!</p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i>More about the music on my third CD</i></b></p>
<p>The <b>Six sonatas for violin solo Op 27</b> by Belgian composer, violinist, pedagogue and conductor, <b>Eugène Auguste Ysaÿe</b> (1858-1931), a real ""dinosaur"" in the violin world feels like music based on the music by Bach and Paganini in romantic-expressionistic language. Each sonata has its own name and program like ""Ballade"",  ""Les Furies"", ""Obsession"", ""L´Aurore"", ""Danse Rustique"" etc. These sonatas are a combination of traditional musical elements and E.Ysaÿe´s innovative use of the material seen from the perspective of the 1920s.  Modal scales sometimes suggest religious atmosphere. There are certain articulations or dissonant energies which might remind you of “fencing with the violin bow”. E. Ysaÿe integrates motifs from the ""Dies Irae"" and used quadruple chords implying a violin sounds multi-dimensional like an organ. </p><p>No. 1 is the longest including a fugato, No. 2 is well-known because of its reminiscence to J.S. Bach´s Preludio from the E-Major Partita, No. 3 “Ballade” the most famous and often played one, No. 4. is very declamatoric and joyful, the two most virtuoso, bright and lucid sonatas are No. 5 and No. 6.</p>
<p>I started studying these pieces at age 17, have been continuously working on them for many years and dedicated a lot of love and enthusiasm to the interpretation of these beautiful pieces I´ve played many times in concert. I am excited being the first female German violinist releasing this tremendous milestone in autumn 2016 with the goal of searching an interpretation based on the latest edition by Henle, München, 2016. Analytical studies of his music, studies of E. Ysaÿe´s life with a whiff of my own creative access to his music lead me to this interpretation. I have even visited Knokke on the Belgian coast a few years ago to see where E. Ysaÿe composed these sonatas between 1923-1924 - each one dedicated to a famous violinist he was friend with.</p>

Ysaÿe´s ""Finale"", Sonata Op 27/4, dedicated to US-Austrian violinist Fritz Kreisler (1875-1962) (Juilliard School library, N.Y.)</p>
<p>E. Ysaÿe played violins by Guarneri del Gesù violin and Stradivarius. He preferred the Guarneri. Generously supported by Florian Leonhard Fine violins London I recorded the sonatas with the Ex-David/ Midori Guarneri del Gesù. With this famous instrument I can create sweet, voluminous, dark timbre sounds, it actually allows me to play the violin in another dimension of expressive possibilities. Ferdinand David was a friend of Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy which gives the instrument a specific aura. This violin is like a holy vulcano for me. I´m always super excited flying occasionally to London, picking up this instrument, playing it for some concerts or recordings and bringing it back after some days.  </p>
<p>As little extra I wrote poems about each sonata for the CD booklet. The Six solo sonatas are for the 85th year of death of Eugène Ysaÿe, 2016.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>""Sojuchameleon for violin solo &amp; field recordings""</b> (2014-16) is an homage to an incredible animal: The chameleon. It has an enormous visual perception, is very sensitive, has a colour-changing skin but - has quite bad ears. Its eye is so sharp that it can read from a distance of one kilometer. The smallest chameleon is only some millimeters long, the biggest around 70 cm and there exist over 200 species. Several chameleons appear in my music like the elephant chameleon, the giant chameleon, the Indian chameleon etc. In African mythology chameleons were put on the heads of ill persons in order to heal or were the ""Hermes"" of the divines.<br/></p>
<p>The other part of my piece’s title, ""Soju"", refers to a Korean wine based on rice and is a metaphor for humans´ need to escape into another, better world.</p>
<p>My piece is based on different scales from Europe, Middle East and Asia and includes jazz with virtuoso, demanding aspects for the violinist. My intention was to create a satire about global noise pollution and abuse of alcohol. Humans in many countries on different levels of intensity are disorientated in a globalized world cutting down more and more cultural codes because of egoistic goals and unreflected use of electronically devices, weapons and manipulative mechanisms within this world we humans are no more aware at all. The effect: Living beings become sick. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474029406/SC_2_Seiten_habzvg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The ""pure"" violin part of my piece ""Sojuchameleon"", later I added field recordings</p>

<p>If you transfer this piece into the media water - you might get an impression how animals in the oceans suffer from human manipulation. We can easily close our eyes, especially in a world dominated by optical sensations, forgetting the unseen rest of the world: The world of sound, noise, smell, taste and touch. This should be an alarm signal to us and we should ask for more conscious and respectful behavior - also towards animals on this globe. „Sojuchameleon“ is an homage to 100 years Dada Zürich, 2016.</p>

South Korea, September 16th, 2016About me and why I do this campaign…
Hello! I am a German violin soloist, composer, performer, poet and professor of violin and chamber music in South Korea. 
A keen interest of my musical research is how and if daily life can be integrated into a musical form.
Are you aware of your personal ""symphony"" each day? How do you wake up? Accompanied by words, with the buzz of your tooth brush or with the sound of drinking some tea or water? Do you listen to birds or do you have to listen to the noise of cars? Or do you listen to your inner voice praying for a fulfilled day? Right – these are the themes and motifs of your daily ""symphony"", varying each day and depending on your activities, environment, team or the humans you interact with. It depends on the sounds we listen to and the kind of thoughts in our heads and hearts. Life is full of sound and noise, which also means, we´re surrounded by lots of information!
What is sound? Vibrations in the air, getting through our ears to our auditory cortex, ""translated"" via nerve cells into sound, which leads to positive and negative emotions. Previously music theorists divided sound into consonances or dissonances but these times have changed drastically. Our body is comprised of a complex system of nerve cells and we are actually a system of mainly water and „cell function“ through electrical signals. An atmosphere with too many external acoustical and electro-magnetical vibrations such as noise from traffic, industry, complex satellite systems, high frequency oceanic tests e.g. are all interfering with our body and the bodies of all living beings.

""Sojuchameleon for violin solo & field recordings"" (2014-16) is an homage to an incredible animal: The chameleon.

CDs before...
My last two CDs - published in 2015 - ""Ja(zz)smine Rice - Violin Mysteries""    (Solo Musica, Munich) and ""Wild Bird"", music for violin & harp, Duo  47/4 with Anna Viechtl (Oehms Classics, Munich) received international acclaim from the American Record guide ""recording of the year"", ""exquisite"", The Strad ""A violinist with a questing mind (…) beautiful…(…) fearless plaiying, bell-like tone"", Neue Musikzeitung ""Stunning!"" e.g. „Ja(zz)smine Rice"" was sponsored by Korean Airline T´Way as main sponsor, ""Wild Bird"" from an anonymous sponsor.
I loved these recording sessions, their intensity, the music, also anecdotes like interrupting the recording process because of birds´ singing in the garden next to the church, garden work, helicopters a.s.o 
My GOAL
After intense studies with E. Ysaÿe´s solo sonatas as well as hundreds of fascinating, shocking and also witty hours searching musical colours for „Sojuchameleon“ I hope you will enjoy this music - another recording of great quality.
I also want to alert society about the importance of nature and particularly oceans.
The CD will be released with Haenssler Classic, a world renowned German independent label for classical music featuring top artists like Frank P. Zimmermann, David Geringas, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau a.o.

<h2>What is happening:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>""The Coldest Sun"" is a two year music production from the Portuguese/Russian female fronted metal band ""The Autist"" and it features Polina Psycheya (All I Could Bleed), Alina Lesnik (Once, Vivaldi Metal Project) and Chiara Tricarico (Temperance). The Coldest Sun is a symphonic metal album for fans of truly melancholic, tragic and  conceptual music that was inspired by deep emotions we all go through on our lives. Hence and since this is so important to all of us - because we're really eager on to make it -, we are asking for all the contribution possible to make this album happen and - most importantly - reward all the people that decided to be a part of this accordingly with awesome loot. </p></li>
<li>We can't really wait to show you how massive ""THE COLDEST SUN"" is sounding. So, after the completion of the production phase we're really excited to move towards the next stage and this is where WE WILL NEED YOU THE MOST, since as a band giving its first babies steps on a world full of struggles The Autist wouldn't be a thing WITHOUT YOU. We really want to make this album get to your hands because when we're composing music, the public is such an important factor and - contrary to belief -, we really think that people matter and influence the vibe of our creations in every single song. We think that without the people to perceive it, art would be meaningless and that's why we want to make this so badly reach the hands of our friends and fans.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What we're offering you and how can you help.</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're bringing you some really awesome prizes with beautiful artwork such as CDs, T-shirts, Pins, Posters and only for the most curious of all, we'd like to offer a very very special/limited ""Pandora's box"" edition with some really interesting surprises inside where you'll able to know and explore the unlimited world of fantasies The Autist can provide. <br/> </li>
<li>​The Autist is gently asking to raise 2500 euros to pay for the expensive manufacture of the merchandise costs for this merch to reach you. We all know that artists these days aren't really worth anything without their friends and fans backing up the music they like. ​</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Let's do this.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How are you affecting The Autist's course by contributing:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I believe that being a professional musician is just as important as being a doctor on a society that thrives on cultural enrichment. We're not surviving anymore - we're experiencing life. Artists are the soul plastics that mould the very fabrique of human mind and allows people to explore their feelings by increasing the awereness of what surrounds us - the universe we live. Yet, due to a very poor commercial structure a lot of artists - specially the ones beginning - have to walk a very hard mile to get to people and sometimes it's very hard for them to make a living out of it. Sometimes the art they make doesn't pay bills and isn't buying them any food.<br/> </li>
<li> We spent a lot of money on the overall production of The Coldest Sun by creating music, videos and artwork to make sure you'd understand our message in the most clear way possible. But we'd like to do more and better in the future - certainly better. We'd like to create a world where no detail is off and only with you, this will be possible. And this my friends, is why contributing to this cause is really that important for us; because we want to keep dedicating ourselves to music and achieve the possibility of being professional artists is without a single doubt our main focus.<br/> </li>
<li>​Contributing to this cause is paving the way to a road of success where you can't really survive without the help of the listeners because music is created to you. Contributing is letting us expressing ourselves and being overwhelemmed by the wonderful reactions people display when they listen to music we create. We feel truly humbled by this sensation. We are fighting to keep writing honest music and bring you the best and the better we can.​</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The struggle is real... but we're overcoming it.</h3>
<ul><li>We understand this crowdfund to be ambitious but when we started producing this album one year ago we decided to make it right - to make it great with very talented people. We decided that it would be possible to bring the best to the people and yet receive this best people can offer too. We're facing the challange and tackling it as part of a course that might be just a beginning of something greater. Birth is painful, but it opens doors to wonderful things. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other things you can do to help us...</h3>
<ul><li>Any help will be trully appreciated and we promise your efforts to get this band working won't be taken lightly. We really value people that understand the importance of bringing our music to the spotlight. So, share our music and get this crowdfunding to as many people as possible...</li></ul>

</b><p><b>Cynthia McKinney,

say about Vic Sadot songs: </b></p>
<p><i><b>""Vic Sadot's
music produces in me a wide range of reactions from awe to action to tears.
Cheney's in the Bunker produces awe because every line of that song is
power-packed with information that most people don't know because it was

Ballad of Pat Tillman give you so much information and make you want to act to
find the truth about 9/11 and reach out to Pat Tillman's parents for their
tremendous loss and the Pentagon's lies to them about it. Finally, The
Kidnapping Coup, about the U.S.-inspired kidnapping of Haiti's President, Jean
Bertrand Aristide, brings me to tears. On song after song, Sadot tells us too
much of the sad, sad truth. Not only have I found in Vic a new friend who
understands my passion for what is right, I've found someone who knows how to

want to pitch to you. Maybe one of them will move you to action! I’ve 
been recording some new music projects for the last 3 years with a 
talented sidekick named Eric Golub. See the Cynthia McKinney and Eric Golub testimonials after my presentation. I don’t think I could release these studio cuts as soon possible without requesting participation in this “Truth Troubadour” CD Project!Here are some song highlights!FULL SPECTRUM DOMINANCE
 – Maybe you don’t want to live in a post 9/11 surveillance state where 
you have no Bill of Rights; where the Empire destroys your Republic. If 
so, help me get a good studio quality mixdown of “Full Spectrum 
Dominance” out there! I used the raw track to put 
out a music video already. My brother Rob Sadot provides some electric guitar underwriting of the somber mood of the song. You can watch it here.NO NUKE BLUES FUKUSHIMA UPDATE
 – If you an Anti-Nuke activist, then you know damn well that these nuke
 plants are un unacceptable risk! You may want to help me get my new “No
 Nuke Blues – Fukushima Update” released on CD! Getting alternative 
radio airplay!AN ACT OF STATE: THE EXECUTION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING – I wrote this one after reading William Pepper’s book by the same title. The purpose of this song was to make people of what was in the book about the King Family’s 1999 trial victory in Memphis, TN, the same town where MLK was gunned down in 1968. The song highlights just a few of the startling discoveries that came out in that trial. After hearing this song, you may be someone who thinks it is important that this song about Martin Luther King reaches a wider audience. It was a delight to get a thank you from William Pepper. It’s posted by the music video link!From William Pepper to Vic Sadot: “Thanks so
much for the effort you and others are making in the common struggle to air the
truth about how this Republic, and each one of us, lost Martin. Thank you for
taking the time to put some important history into a ballad. This, of course,
is the role of the Balladeer without whom much of history would be lost,
especially in our time with the consolidation of control of the mainstream
media. I am grateful. Bill Pepper”THE HARBOR OF LOVE - Maybe it’s this love song that you’d like to know you helped get into the distribution mix! This new Berkeley, CA recording is just me on vocals and acoustic guitar… with my buddy Eric Golub on viola and ukulele. It can put you in the mood! MASTERS OF WAR is one of them! It’s a little shorter and less morose than Bob Dylan’s original one… But it has the same meaning and urgency today! You can hear the raw mix version of Masters of War at Eric Golub SoundCloud! We also have a version of John Lennon’s WORKING CLASS HERO that could fit on this CD! We did some Phil Ochs songs and are likely to pick one! I met and interviewed Phil Ochs in 1973. In 2015 I made a video from that audio that you can watch on YouTube: ""Phil Ochs May 1973 Interview by Vic Sadot & Rich Lang"" (30:10).

<p></p>
<h3><b>The Lullaby Songs!! See Back Cover List below!</b></h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>OLD &amp; NEW LULLABIES</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>This CD includes Lullaby Songs which go back as far as 15th Century England: ""I Gave My Love a Cherry, and also includes several modern lullabies such as Bill Staines' ""First Lullaby,"" Peter Paul and Mary's ""Gone The Rainbow"" co-written with Milton Okun, and Cris Williamson's ""Like A Ship In the Harbor,"" just to name a few!! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>ODE TO LUSSAMIER</b></div>
<div>
<b>""Ode to Lussamier""</b> is a song I wrote to honor my Mom's life. This one song names 4 songs within it that my Mom used to sing, my Mom and Dad used to sing together, and us four girls and our Mom and Dad sang as a family!!  <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The song covers my Mom's early life growing up in China, to life in New York, and then life in Sedona. Speaking of my Mom's early days growing up in China, my Mom, born Lois Muriel Hubbard (1923), was the daughter of Methodist missionaries in Malaysia and China. When in China where she was born, the cooks could not pronounce Lois Muriel, so they nick-named her ""Lussamier,"" which is what my Dad always called her!! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>One song referenced in <b>""Ode to Lussamier""</b>  is called ""Just Like A Gypsy,"" which was our Mom and Dad's engagement song. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Another song referenced in <b>""Ode to Lussamier""</b> is Mom's wake up song. If we didn't wake up in time to do our chores on the weekend, she would bring her guitar in to our bedroom and sing us a rousing version of the wake-up song...until we woke up to do our chores!!  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Songs were so many things to our family...motivators, ways to share love and friendship, ways to grieve....ways to heal. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is how <b>""Ode to Lussamier""</b> begins:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>""Please Let Me Tell You a Story, About a Beautiful Woman I Knew...She was my Best Friend and Mother, and I Loved Her, Loved Her So True....Oh What a Beautiful Mommy...I Think of You Every Day...Oh What a Beautiful Mommy, Please Hold Me and Love Me Today...""</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>THE GOLDEN DAY IS DYING</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>One song on the Lullabies For The Heart CD is called <b>""The Golden Day is Dying."" </b>This was a great road trip or hiking song: At any time the sun was setting we would just all stop and start singing...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div> <b>""The Golden Day is Dying....Beyond the Purple Hill...The Golden Day is Dying Beyond the Purple Hill...The Lark That Sang At Morning in Dusky Wood Is Still The Lark That Sang At Morning in Dusky Wood is Still...And Soon Above the Meadow the Silver Moon Will Swing, And Soon Above the Meadow The Silver Moon Will Swing...And Where the Wood is Darkest the Nightingale will Sing....And Where the Wood is Darkest The Nightingale Will Sing...."" </b>
</div>
<div>What incredibly beautiful memories!!!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>GOODNIGHT BELOVED</b></div>
<div>Another beautiful song on this Lullaby compilation is called: <b>""Goodnight Beloved""</b> This song has a very special meaning to me personally because at the very end of my Mom's life, I moved from Santa Barbara, CA to Sedona, AZ (where I am typing this now!) to become my Mom's live-in caregiver until she passed. Each night I would tuck her into bed, and we would sing the ""Goodnight Beloved"" song to each other across the hallway, in harmony of course, each tucked in our own beds. Since then, whenever I have the chance to sing this song to someone live, I take it! And now, YOU can hear the ""Goodnight Beloved"" song every night! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>""Goodnight Beloved Goodnight, Goodnight. God Keep You Safe in His Watchful Sight. Goodnight Dear, Dream of Me. And May Your Dreams Ever Pleasant Be. Good Night Dear, Dream of Me....And May Your Dreams Every Pleasant Be...Good Night Love.....""</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>These songs will touch your Heart and Soothe Your Soul! Listen to them to comfort a crying child, grandchild, friend, or your inner child! Listen to these songs to deeply relax, and drift off to a healing sleep!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b><i>PASSING ON THE LULLABY LEGACY TO YOU!!</i></b></div>
<div><b>And now I am passing the legacy on to you and your children, grandchildren, and your Inner Child!! Singing was a daily occurrence in the McClure household, and those of you who know me, know that singing is a daily occurrence for me still today!!  I just call people up and sing them healing songs directly or to their voicemail. And with this CD, MANY MORE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THESE HEALING SONGS!!</b></div>

<br/>
</div>
<div><b>Zoon, Zoon</b></div>
<div>The Lullaby <b>""Zoon, Zoon""</b> is one my Mom used to sing to me all the time. I adore this song. It speaks of the moon over the ocean and how the moon man ""casts his silvery net...fashioned from moon beams three. And some folks say when the net lies long, and no one else is nigh, the moon man fishes for some old song...that fell from a sailor's pipe....Oh the waves roll out, and the waves roll in, and the nodding night winds blow....and why the moon man fishes the sea...only the moon man knows.""  What a precious song!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A funny story about the <b>Zoon, Zoon Lullaby</b>, one night many years ago...in the '90's, I went to a Poetry Reading out on the Pier in Santa Barbara. At the end of the professional poets' presentations, they allowed ten people to go up to the mike and read their own poem. I was the 10th person. Imagine....10pm at night, out on a pier, the rings clinking on sailboat masts, and I sang: </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>""Zoon, Zoon cuddle and croon down by the crinkling sea, the moon man casts his silvery net, fashioned from moonbeams three...and some folks say when the net lies long, and no one else is there, the moon man fishes for a golden comb...that fell from the mermaid's hair....oh the waves roll out and the waves roll in, and the sea goes dip, and doe....and why the moon man fishes the sea...only the moon man knows......""</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>There was total silence and everyone there was deeply soothed by the night sea air, the clinking of the sailboat masts, and the ""Zoon, Zoon"" Lullaby.</div>

The Impact
  
Lullabies bring peace to the Heart. Gwendolyn's Voice of an earth angel Brings Healing, Love & Comfort to the Soul.

 
Lullabies Through the Generations. Most of these Lullabies are passed down from my Mother & Father, Muriel and Richard McClure, who sang to me as a child. From their generation...to future generations....I honor them with this recording. Love you Mom & Dad! Thanks for Singing me to sleep every night!! 



Contributing to the Oral Tradition. Hearing & Learning Songs contributes to the Oral Tradition in our modern world. Lullabies connect us with a long lineage of parents soothing  their children through Loving Voice.




The Lullaby Songs!! See Back Cover List below!

OLD & NEW LULLABIES

This CD includes Lullaby Songs which go back as far as 15th Century England: ""I Gave My Love a Cherry, and also includes several modern lullabies such as Bill Staines' ""First Lullaby,"" Peter Paul and Mary's ""Gone The Rainbow"" co-written with Milton Okun, and Cris Williamson's ""Like A Ship In the Harbor,"" just to name a few!! 

ODE TO LUSSAMIER

""Ode to Lussamier"" is a song I wrote to honor my Mom's life. This one song names 4 songs within it that my Mom used to sing, my Mom and Dad used to sing together, and us four girls and our Mom and Dad sang as a family!!  


The song covers my Mom's early life growing up in China, to life in New York, and then life in Sedona. Speaking of my Mom's early days growing up in China, my Mom, born Lois Muriel Hubbard (1923), was the daughter of Methodist missionaries in Malaysia and China. When in China where she was born, the cooks could not pronounce Lois Muriel, so they nick-named her ""Lussamier,"" which is what my Dad always called her!! 

One song referenced in ""Ode to Lussamier""  is called ""Just Like A Gypsy,"" which was our Mom and Dad's engagement song. 

Another song referenced in ""Ode to Lussamier"" is Mom's wake up song. If we didn't wake up in time to do our chores on the weekend, she would bring her guitar in to our bedroom and sing us a rousing version of the wake-up song...until we woke up to do our chores!!  

Songs were so many things to our family...motivators, ways to share love and friendship, ways to grieve....ways to heal. 

This is how ""Ode to Lussamier"" begins:

""Please Let Me Tell You a Story, About a Beautiful Woman I Knew...She was my Best Friend and Mother, and I Loved Her, Loved Her So True....Oh What a Beautiful Mommy...I Think of You Every Day...Oh What a Beautiful Mommy, Please Hold Me and Love Me Today...""


THE GOLDEN DAY IS DYING

One song on the Lullabies For The Heart CD is called ""The Golden Day is Dying."" This was a great road trip or hiking song: At any time the sun was setting we would just all stop and start singing...

 ""The Golden Day is Dying....Beyond the Purple Hill...The Golden Day is Dying Beyond the Purple Hill...The Lark That Sang At Morning in Dusky Wood Is Still The Lark That Sang At Morning in Dusky Wood is Still...And Soon Above the Meadow the Silver Moon Will Swing, And Soon Above the Meadow The Silver Moon Will Swing...And Where the Wood is Darkest the Nightingale will Sing....And Where the Wood is Darkest The Nightingale Will Sing...."" 

What incredibly beautiful memories!!!

GOODNIGHT BELOVED
Another beautiful song on this Lullaby compilation is called: ""Goodnight Beloved"" This song has a very special meaning to me personally because at the very end of my Mom's life, I moved from Santa Barbara, CA to Sedona, AZ (where I am typing this now!) to become my Mom's live-in caregiver until she passed. Each night I would tuck her into bed, and we would sing the ""Goodnight Beloved"" song to each other across the hallway, in harmony of course, each tucked in our own beds. Since then, whenever I have the chance to sing this song to someone live, I take it! And now, YOU can hear the ""Goodnight Beloved"" song every night! 

""Goodnight Beloved Goodnight, Goodnight. God Keep You Safe in His Watchful Sight. Goodnight Dear, Dream of Me. And May Your Dreams Ever Pleasant Be. Good Night Dear, Dream of Me....And May Your Dreams Every Pleasant Be...Good Night Love.....""

These songs will touch your Heart and Soothe Your Soul! Listen to them to comfort a crying child, grandchild, friend, or your inner child! Listen to these songs to deeply relax, and drift off to a healing sleep!

PASSING ON THE LULLABY LEGACY TO YOU!!
And now I am passing the legacy on to you and your children, grandchildren, and your Inner Child!! Singing was a daily occurrence in the McClure household, and those of you who know me, know that singing is a daily occurrence for me still today!!  I just call people up and sing them healing songs directly or to their voicemail. And with this CD, MANY MORE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THESE HEALING SONGS!!


Lullabies For The Heart's Song List





Zoon, Zoon
The Lullaby ""Zoon, Zoon"" is one my Mom used to sing to me all the time. I adore this song. It speaks of the moon over the ocean and how the moon man ""casts his silvery net...fashioned from moon beams three. And some folks say when the net lies long, and no one else is nigh, the moon man fishes for some old song...that fell from a sailor's pipe....Oh the waves roll out, and the waves roll in, and the nodding night winds blow....and why the moon man fishes the sea...only the moon man knows.""  What a precious song!

A funny story about the Zoon, Zoon Lullaby, one night many years ago...in the '90's, I went to a Poetry Reading out on the Pier in Santa Barbara. At the end of the professional poets' presentations, they allowed ten people to go up to the mike and read their own poem. I was the 10th person. Imagine....10pm at night, out on a pier, the rings clinking on sailboat masts, and I sang: 

""Zoon, Zoon cuddle and croon down by the crinkling sea, the moon man casts his silvery net, fashioned from moonbeams three...and some folks say when the net lies long, and no one else is there, the moon man fishes for a golden comb...that fell from the mermaid's hair....oh the waves roll out and the waves roll in, and the sea goes dip, and doe....and why the moon man fishes the sea...only the moon man knows......""

There was total silence and everyone there was deeply soothed by the night sea air, the clinking of the sailboat masts, and the ""Zoon, Zoon"" Lullaby.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO MAKE THE DREAM OF LULLABIES FOR THE HEART BECOME A REALITY!!

MAY THESE LULLABIES BRING YOU PEACE IN YOUR HEART, AND LOVE TO YOUR SOUL!!
