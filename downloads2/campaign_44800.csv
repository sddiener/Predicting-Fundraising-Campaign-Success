<p>Marie Margot Couture is the proud winner of “Denver’s Best Designer, 2016”!  Having served Denver-area brides for 6 years, Maggie Burns now dreams of sharing her bridal creations across the United States. Maggie has created an 8-piece, ready to wear collection consisting of the same quality, attention-to-detail, and unconventional styles and colors that define the existing <a href=""http://www.mariemargot.com/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Marie-Margot Bridal Couture</span></a> brand. Maggie has her eight unique designs for the collection illustrated in her sketchbook, has sewn four of the gowns to show at a recent fashion show, and has secured a trustworthy relationship with a manufacturer. The eight gowns, pictured below, are meant to showcase Maggie's love of unique, non-traditional styles that define her couture business. She has an inspiring story and work ethic, and has everything in place to make her dream a reality-- except the financial means to make it come to fruition! </p>

Inspired by the Quality of Couture





Marie Margot Couture is the proud winner of “Denver’s Best Designer, 2016”!  Having served Denver-area brides for 6 years, Maggie Burns now dreams of sharing her bridal creations across the United States. Maggie has created an 8-piece, ready to wear collection consisting of the same quality, attention-to-detail, and unconventional styles and colors that define the existing Marie-Margot Bridal Couture brand. Maggie has her eight unique designs for the collection illustrated in her sketchbook, has sewn four of the gowns to show at a recent fashion show, and has secured a trustworthy relationship with a manufacturer. The eight gowns, pictured below, are meant to showcase Maggie's love of unique, non-traditional styles that define her couture business. She has an inspiring story and work ethic, and has everything in place to make her dream a reality-- except the financial means to make it come to fruition! 


Where will your contribution go?
Maggie's goal is to raise at least $50,000 during this 30 day campaign. Here's where she'll spend the money:
1.) Production, material costs, and shipping of 16 samples for her 8-piece collection. One sample of each gown will be made in a size 2/4 and another in a size 10/12. 
2.) Expenses to attend and take orders at the National Bridal Market in Chicago from September 8th- 11th, 2016! These expenses include the booth reservation cost, exhibitor fees, travel, hotel, transportation, marketing materials, sales and marketing expenses, and displays. 


3.) Purchasing updated equipment (serger machine, straight-stitch machine, and dress forms) to improve quality & productivity


4.) Funds to manufacture gowns after receiving orders and to continue taking orders from bridal salons across the country and expanding the Marie-Margot Ready-to-Wear bridal collection

HIPSTER™ PLUS is a 3D baby carrier that is super comfortable for baby and parent, easily adjustable and with our special unique pouch under the hip seat, you can even replace your diaper bag, allowing you to be truly handsfree. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/726/574/88ccb80d4b2fc54e12abeabdc185f2a6_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460751373&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=44e829c9f79950f7bdb6ebd87c6b10bf"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/747/525/fd57f829b09a45715a43ac839ada7c47_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460984556&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=81255cbc5d2960a9597b36da15d6e873"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><br/><p>What are the benefits of the 3D hip seat? We specifically engineered a carrier with a built in ergonomic 3D hip seat so that no matter which position you carry your baby, whether it’s facing in, forward facing, hip carry or back carry, your baby’s hips are always in the correct M position, knees supported at hip level, legs open and not dangling. It’s literally impossible to wear your baby wrong in our carrier. The hip seat absorbs the weight of the baby so your baby will feel much lighter on your shoulders and you’ll feel less pressure on your back. Because the baby is sitting on an extra seat, unlike a normal traditional carrier where baby has to be wrapped tightly to the parent’s body, the 3D hip seat provides more room for the baby so he won’t feel enclosed in.<br/></p><p><img alt=""ergonomic 3D hip seat ensures proper hip position every single time"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/711/489/5d90da9a917a7fe63051e53e5003832a_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460589645&amp;q=92&amp;s=aeb8142fbe6dfd28f6b302324635e7ea"" src="""" style=""""/></p><figcaption>ergonomic 3D hip seat ensures proper hip position every single time</figcaption><br/><p></p><p><b>The reality is shopping for a baby carrier can be overwhelming especially for a first time parent, here is how HIPSTER PLUS solves these issues:</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p></p><h1></h1><h1>

<p><b>Common issue:</b> Oftentimes, a family might need to buy two carriers due to the fact that different family members have different body types and as your child grows, they are required to invest in toddler sized carrier.</p>
<p><b>HIPSTER™ PLUS solution:</b> HIPSTER™ PLUS is fully adjustable in the waist belt and shoulder straps that family members of different sizes can use the same carrier. We also provide an extender belt (available from our ""add on"" menu for $25, see more details in FAQ) which can fit up to a waist of 59 inches, HIPSTER™ PLUS can be used from newborn (with our infant insert) up to 3 years old (or 20 kg)</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/726/874/38ef2f17421c1bd44e30137c1badc46a_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460753203&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=23a62d4b28ce76180ccafbbbb0ffee28"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Common issue:</b> As your baby grows and gets heavier, carrying your baby for long periods of time without a carrier can be very hard on your body. Wrap doesn’t provide strong back support. Ring slings puts pressure on one shoulder and there’s no lumbar support. Most structured carriers don’t have a strong waist belt </p>
<p><b>HIPSTER™ PLUS solution: </b>Not only does the hip seat absorbs the weight of your baby so that the weight you feel will also be significantly lighter, HIPSTER™ PLUS comes with a high waist belt (same concept as the waist protection belt that movers wear when they have to carry heavy items) to protect your lower back. </p>

<p><b>Common issue:</b> Some carriers does not offer forward facing as an option because baby’s hips are not supported and will dangle. <br/><br/><b>HIPSTER™ PLUS solution:</b> With HIPSTER™ PLUS's 3D hip seat, which ensures that baby’s legs are always in the M positioning, so baby’s legs are well position even facing forward.  We want to offer parents the option to forward face their baby because as your baby develops, he will naturally be curious by his surroundings and forwarding facing allows your baby to explore while in the comfort and safety of your arms (same concept with turning the stroller seat forward when your baby starts to want to interact and see the world around him). We advise forward facing for short periods when baby is active. Naturally, there is a greater risk of overstimulation than with the 'facing in' position, since the child cannot actively turn away but since baby is right there with you, it allows parents to actively perceive the signals their children are giving. Parents know their children best and can tell when their child is fussy, tired or ""zoned out"" and it is time to switch to the 'facing in' or back carrying position.</p>

<p><b>Common Issue:</b> Hip Dysplasia is a condition where the ball of the thighbone doesn’t quite fit securely into the hip socket. If baby’s hips are stretched out too much it might distort the cup-shaped socket. Hip dysplasia doesn’t hurt for a baby, but it can lead to unnecessary permanent damage to the hips. No carrier can cause hip dysplasia if the baby doesn’t already have hip dysplasia as a pre-existing condition. In Switzerland, we have mandatory hip ultrasounds at 2 months old but not all countries require this mandatory check up and since hip dysplasia is a silent condition (no pain to the baby), sometimes hip dysplasia can be left undetected till too late.  </p>

<div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The good news is we've done this before and boy, did we learn a lot the first time. Manufacturing is a complex process. In this past year, we’ve worked hard on improving our supply chain by partnering up with accredited manufacturers, high quality brand hardware and implemented smart quality control processes. It took a lot of sweat and tears but we can now say we are very confident in our ability to deliver HIPSTER™ PLUS to you on time. </p>
<p>The only risk we foresee is in delivery but our estimates for delivery are conservative that being said, things can still go wrong. Aspects that are out of our control, such as delay delivery of components and material, fabric customized in the wrong color, will cause deadlines to be pushed back but we are experienced in overcoming obstacles and we promise we will work day and night to minimize any impact on delivery. </p>
<p>In the event of unexpected delay, we will absolutely keep you updated!</p>
<p>UPDATE: So far, production is on schedule and we are aiming for delivery of all Indiegogo backers in August.</p>

The next generation of 3D baby carrier has arrived: More functionality, easier to use, and even more comfortable 2015 was a great first year for MiaMily. We won the Bizzie Baby Gold award with a 5 out of 5 stars and received approval stamps from the International Hip Dysplasia Institute and the Baby Carrier Industry Alliance recognizing that MiaMily develops products that consider the importance of healthy hip development during infancy. About this projectThe next generation of 3D baby carrier has arrived: More functionality, easier to use, and even more comfortable 2015 was a great first year for MiaMily. We won the Bizzie Baby Gold award with a 5 out of 5 stars and received approval stamps from the International Hip Dysplasia Institute and the Baby Carrier Industry Alliance recognizing that MiaMily develops products that consider the importance of healthy hip development during infancy.Approved by International Hip Dysplasia InstituteThrough all this, we've received constant feedback and we’ve taken this to heart, and with our passion for making parent’s lives easier, we knew that we could make an even better 3D baby carrier. HIPSTER™ PLUS is a 3D baby carrier that is super comfortable for baby and parent, easily adjustable and with our special unique pouch under the hip seat, you can even replace your diaper bag, allowing you to be truly handsfree. What are the benefits of the 3D hip seat? We specifically engineered a carrier with a built in ergonomic 3D hip seat so that no matter which position you carry your baby, whether it’s facing in, forward facing, hip carry or back carry, your baby’s hips are always in the correct M position, knees supported at hip level, legs open and not dangling. It’s literally impossible to wear your baby wrong in our carrier. The hip seat absorbs the weight of the baby so your baby will feel much lighter on your shoulders and you’ll feel less pressure on your back. Because the baby is sitting on an extra seat, unlike a normal traditional carrier where baby has to be wrapped tightly to the parent’s body, the 3D hip seat provides more room for the baby so he won’t feel enclosed in.ergonomic 3D hip seat ensures proper hip position every single timeThe reality is shopping for a baby carrier can be overwhelming especially for a first time parent, here is how HIPSTER PLUS solves these issues:

Common issue: When you choose to take a baby carrier instead of a stroller, you will inevitably have to bring a bag with you to carry baby essentials (diapers, wipes, bottle, bib, keys, wallet, etc). HIPSTER™ PLUS solution: The newest feature of HIPSTER™ PLUS is the pocket under the 3D hip seat which conveniently keeps your baby items close by and you can focus on what really matters. You can now leave the house with just your baby and HIPSTER™ PLUS, no more big bulky diaper bags!Leave the house with just your HIPSTER!https://youtu.be/Uu9yNOFXShwCommon issue: It’s hard to understand which style of carrier is best for your family’s needs. HIPSTER™ PLUS solution: WithHIPSTER™ PLUS, you can wear your baby up to 9 different ways. Our unique attachment system allows you to use the carrier as a hip seat (without any attachment), or like a traditional structured carrier (using our double shoulder attachment) or like a ring sling (using our single shoulder attachment).  HIPSTER™ PLUS comes with the double shoulder attachment and you can purchase our single shoulder attachment from our ""add-on"" menu (see FAQ) for $30.  With HIPSTER™ PLUS, you can carry your baby 6 different ways, and if you buy the additional single shoulder attachment, you get 3 additional ways to carry your baby!Up to 9 different ways to carry your baby.To see lifestyle photos of how to wear your baby 9 different ways, visit here

Common issue: Oftentimes, a family might need to buy two carriers due to the fact that different family members have different body types and as your child grows, they are required to invest in toddler sized carrier.
HIPSTER™ PLUS solution: HIPSTER™ PLUS is fully adjustable in the waist belt and shoulder straps that family members of different sizes can use the same carrier. We also provide an extender belt (available from our ""add on"" menu for $25, see more details in FAQ) which can fit up to a waist of 59 inches, HIPSTER™ PLUS can be used from newborn (with our infant insert) up to 3 years old (or 20 kg)


Common issue: As your baby grows and gets heavier, carrying your baby for long periods of time without a carrier can be very hard on your body. Wrap doesn’t provide strong back support. Ring slings puts pressure on one shoulder and there’s no lumbar support. Most structured carriers don’t have a strong waist belt 
HIPSTER™ PLUS solution: Not only does the hip seat absorbs the weight of your baby so that the weight you feel will also be significantly lighter, HIPSTER™ PLUS comes with a high waist belt (same concept as the waist protection belt that movers wear when they have to carry heavy items) to protect your lower back. 
Allows parent to have proper spinal posture

Common issue: Some carriers does not offer forward facing as an option because baby’s hips are not supported and will dangle. HIPSTER™ PLUS solution: With HIPSTER™ PLUS's 3D hip seat, which ensures that baby’s legs are always in the M positioning, so baby’s legs are well position even facing forward.  We want to offer parents the option to forward face their baby because as your baby develops, he will naturally be curious by his surroundings and forwarding facing allows your baby to explore while in the comfort and safety of your arms (same concept with turning the stroller seat forward when your baby starts to want to interact and see the world around him). We advise forward facing for short periods when baby is active. Naturally, there is a greater risk of overstimulation than with the 'facing in' position, since the child cannot actively turn away but since baby is right there with you, it allows parents to actively perceive the signals their children are giving. Parents know their children best and can tell when their child is fussy, tired or ""zoned out"" and it is time to switch to the 'facing in' or back carrying position.

Our hip seat ensure baby's legs are supported at hip level even facing forward



Common Issue: Hip Dysplasia is a condition where the ball of the thighbone doesn’t quite fit securely into the hip socket. If baby’s hips are stretched out too much it might distort the cup-shaped socket. Hip dysplasia doesn’t hurt for a baby, but it can lead to unnecessary permanent damage to the hips. No carrier can cause hip dysplasia if the baby doesn’t already have hip dysplasia as a pre-existing condition. In Switzerland, we have mandatory hip ultrasounds at 2 months old but not all countries require this mandatory check up and since hip dysplasia is a silent condition (no pain to the baby), sometimes hip dysplasia can be left undetected till too late.  
Hip Dsyplasia is a silent condition
HIPSTER™ PLUS Solution: We incorporated a 3D hip seat specifically for this purpose, it ensures your baby’s hips are always in the correct M position, Knees bent, hips bent and open to the side and thighs supported. It’s impossible to position your baby wrongly.
M Position - legs wide, knees bent, lifted at hip levelOur hip seat ensures your baby's legs are always in the correct M position“The International Hip Dsyplasia Institute has tested and approved our HIPSTER™ PLUS as a hip healthy product”Common issue: Wraps and ring slings can be complicated to learn. Many moms are overwhelmed by the intricate fabric systems and dads tend to not be willing to learn  HIPSTER PLUS solution: HIPSTER™ PLUS is very straight forward , the waist belt velcro attachment takes seconds to put on. HIPSTER PLUS takes only seconds to put on

Common issue: Some carriers aren't so easy to learn how to use on the first try so dads get turned off from baby wearing. Most carriers have feminine color and print design, not daddy friendly.
HIPSTER™ PLUS solution: HIPSTER™ PLUS is very easy to learn how to use on the first try. We purposely choose uni-sex colors because we want the parent to feel good about wearing the carrier.
Due to the manufacture condition, HIPSTER™ PLUS is only offered in Stone Grey for now. New colors will be release depending on the total quantity of the pledges.

My son loves all the different ways we are able to wear it as well! We overheat easily with other carriers but with this one for the most part we stay nice and cool! Even during long hot days in full sun!"" - Stephanie""I will not be buying any other structural carrier but this one right here! [...] My other favorite feature is the hip seat itself you can use it to breastfeed putting it higher on your tummy to support your arm! I started using this with my 10lb baby at 7 weeks using the hipseat to nurse in public."" - Cristina""If you could only register for 1 item when you are having a baby- it should be this!"" - LaDonna Chavez""I tried so many different brands of baby carriers and only this one in my opinion most ergonomic for babies' spine and hips. It is very comfortable for both baby and mother. My daughter loves it."" - Alexandra""I absolutely luv this carrier! I have moby wrap, chicco ultra soft, good grief about four other types of infant/toddler carriers.... And none come close to the ease & comfort of this carrier."" - Araceley Parra""This is a great option for forward facing carrying. The seat provides extra support and my son loves facing out."" - Chelsi Yarger Weedon""This is the best carrier I own. I went through wrap carriers (boba and moby), mei tai, lille baby, baby bjorn original, baby bjorn miracle, and tried on multiple in stores after these failed. The little guy LOVES it. He loves facing out and seeing what is happening as we walk. He loves kicking and jumping in the seat. He is so comfortable and can sit in it for hours (until he's hungry or tired). My back is so comfortable with this carrier even as he has grown more. My husband loves wearing him in this as well and agrees it is our best carrier ... which is a good thing because the little guy hates being in a stroller for too long! Anywhere we go the stroller ends up being more of a cart for our belongings. We are so grateful to have found this carrier! "" - AH





  Risks & Challenges  
The good news is we've done this before and boy, did we learn a lot the first time. Manufacturing is a complex process. In this past year, we’ve worked hard on improving our supply chain by partnering up with accredited manufacturers, high quality brand hardware and implemented smart quality control processes. It took a lot of sweat and tears but we can now say we are very confident in our ability to deliver HIPSTER™ PLUS to you on time. 
The only risk we foresee is in delivery but our estimates for delivery are conservative that being said, things can still go wrong. Aspects that are out of our control, such as delay delivery of components and material, fabric customized in the wrong color, will cause deadlines to be pushed back but we are experienced in overcoming obstacles and we promise we will work day and night to minimize any impact on delivery. 
In the event of unexpected delay, we will absolutely keep you updated!
UPDATE: So far, production is on schedule and we are aiming for delivery of all Indiegogo backers in August.",36.0,6,"2 Campaigns

My name is Laura Legendary, and I am the unlikely entrepreneur behind the
Elegant Insights Braille jewelry and accessories collection.  What makes
me an unlikely entrepreneur?  For starters, I am a business owner who is
blind.   </p>
<p>Elegant
Insights products were inspired by a gift I received while struggling through
an agonizing time in my life, the loss of my beloved husband, Billy.  Life
is a journey consisting of many twists and turns, some of them painful and
difficult to navigate.  So, for a bit of inspiration, I was given a tiny
little talisman to help me keep moving forward.  It was a ""worry
stone,"" with the word ""survivor"" engraved on one side, and to my
surprise, the same word embossed in Braille on the other.  Right then and
there, the light bulb went on over my head, and the entire concept of the
Elegant Insights collection came to me in a single flash of inspiration. </p>
<p>Never
one to ignore my intuition or neglect an insight, I set about the task of
finding a manufacturer to assist me in bringing my ideas to life.  The
search began in August, 2009, lasting nearly two years.</p>
<p>At
first, I sought a manufacturer already mass-producing Braille jewelry.  I
looked everywhere, including out-of-country options, and realized that there
was no such animal.  Besides, I really wanted to find a manufacturer in
the USA, since I am a flag-waving maniac, after all.  </p>
<p>Unable
to find a ready-made resource, I realized that if I was going to bring my 
ideas to life, I would need to get to work! And so I did, and <a href=""http://elegantinsightsjewelry.com/shop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elegant Insights</a> was born. In the years since, I have designed
dozens of pieces, hand crafted them with a team in the USA, and sold them via my
web site, via phone, and at trade shows across the country.</p>
<p><b>The Collections:</b></p>
<p>Here

Are Elegant Insights Braille Creations?
The
Elegant Insights product line consists of traditional jewelry items, such as
bracelets, necklaces, and earrings, as well as fun accessories such as purse
charms, cane charms, and even bookmarks. 
All of our jewelry, accessories, and gifts feature the Elegant Insights
tactile twist...Braille!  Jewelry can
make a fashion statement all its own, and combined with personalization, the
unique look of Braille, and the pretty design elements of gleaming contemporary
metals and natural, opaque gemstones, our products offer an opportunity for
self-expression unlike anything you've seen (or felt!) before.                                BackgroundHi! 
My name is Laura Legendary, and I am the unlikely entrepreneur behind the
Elegant Insights Braille jewelry and accessories collection.  What makes
me an unlikely entrepreneur?  For starters, I am a business owner who is
blind.   
Elegant
Insights products were inspired by a gift I received while struggling through
an agonizing time in my life, the loss of my beloved husband, Billy.  Life
is a journey consisting of many twists and turns, some of them painful and
difficult to navigate.  So, for a bit of inspiration, I was given a tiny
little talisman to help me keep moving forward.  It was a ""worry
stone,"" with the word ""survivor"" engraved on one side, and to my
surprise, the same word embossed in Braille on the other.  Right then and
there, the light bulb went on over my head, and the entire concept of the
Elegant Insights collection came to me in a single flash of inspiration. 
Never
one to ignore my intuition or neglect an insight, I set about the task of
finding a manufacturer to assist me in bringing my ideas to life.  The
search began in August, 2009, lasting nearly two years.
At
first, I sought a manufacturer already mass-producing Braille jewelry.  I
looked everywhere, including out-of-country options, and realized that there
was no such animal.  Besides, I really wanted to find a manufacturer in
the USA, since I am a flag-waving maniac, after all.  
Unable
to find a ready-made resource, I realized that if I was going to bring my 
ideas to life, I would need to get to work! And so I did, and Elegant Insights was born. In the years since, I have designed
dozens of pieces, hand crafted them with a team in the USA, and sold them via my
web site, via phone, and at trade shows across the country.
The Collections:
Here
are some examples of our incredible collections. See more at our web site, http://elegantinsightsjewelry.com:
The
Vain Cane Collection:  Why should you be
the only one who gets to wear jewelry? 
Dress up your favorite traveling companion with a fun flash of style!
               
The
Touch of Purse-onality Collection:  It's
jewelry for your handbag!  A glittering
waterfall of gems, beads, and charm embellishments cascade down a length of
chain, with a Braille embossed charm at the bottom.
     
The
Text Messaging Collection:  Jewelry and
accessories that you can wear and share or give as gifts.  That's what we call tactile style!
    
Themed Collections: Complete sets of jewelry and accessories in styles that complement each other - and you. Choose from The Falling in Leaf Collection or the Touch of Nature Collection (selections pictured below), or view others at our website.                        Use

Elegant
Insights has been in business for five years, and we are now presented with a
tremendous opportunity.  We have been selected to showcase our products
online with the new Amazon Handmade Services platform.  With the additional
exposure, higher-volume platform, and increased marketing, we expect sales to
grow dramatically.
In
order to create sufficient inventory to meet demand, I will need additional
capital to:


Hire two additional craftspeople;

Purchase workbenches, tools, and supplies for these
two artisans;

Purchase the sheet metal, parts and components
for jewelry making; and

Procure the hand tools needed to put it all
together. 

This opportunity will mean
worldwide exposure for my beautiful Braille embossed jewelry, and customers who
shop on Amazon seeking special gifts for people with vision loss will discover
a distinctive collection of jewelry and accessories all handcrafted, made in
the USA, and embossed in crisp, readable, Braille.  Can you imagine a more
meaningful and personal gift to give a loved one with vision loss? The Plan:
There
are many ways you can help!  While any
donation amount will be appreciated, some things are more valuable than
money.  You can make a huge contribution
by letting me leverage your network. 
Please share my project with your friends, fans, followers, and
family.  Tweet out my campaign link,
share it on your Facebook page, post this info on your favorite email lists,
forward this message to your email contacts. 
No effort on my behalf will go to waste, because I am passionate about
what I'm doing, and will let no opportunity pass me by.  Contributions will go directly to expanding
Elegant Insights.  I need two
workbenches, as well as tools, sheet metal, components and jewelry crafting
supplies for two new employees, who will also require training...for example, I
will need to teach them to read Braille!

<h3>The Curiosity Kitten Is Sleeping!</h3>
<p>And so the concept for this adorable pin was created. ""Curiosity is not Entitlement,"" Is a mantra I use whenever people ask me questions that are wayyyyyy too personal. You should feel secure in declining to answer without worrying about social taboos. Let the kitten sleep.</p>
<p>The fragments of ideas kept bouncing around in my head until eventually the symbolism came together. It's a play on words of ""Curiosity killed the cat."" So, we let the kitten sleep. It's no coincidence that they are snuggling in a quilt with the same colors and pattern as the trans flag.</p>
<p>Greetings! I am Odin, I am a nonbinary individual that makes shiny things and yell on the internet. And because I am obsessed with enamel pins, I decided to try my hand at creating my own.</p>
<p>The design for this pin went through a small set of iterations, until a lovely friend took pity on my lack of skills and came up with an adorable design:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541969221/ff2wom2mktzuepmn3h6g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make this pin run possible, I need to have a minimum order of 50 pins for the manufacturer to accept my order. </p>
<p>You will receive an enamel pin (or more if you selected the higher tiers) of the finalized Curiosity Kitten design. The pins will be roughly 1in wide.</p>
<p>But then, there are STICKERS!!!!! Everyone loves stickers. Slap some stickers on everything! The stickers will be larger at roughly 3in x 2.5in</p>
<p>I would like to go well over that goal in order to make a bigger impact on selected charities to benefit from this project:</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Part of the proceeds are going toward trans based organizations. $1.50 of each pin and .50 cents of each sticker will be going toward:</p>
<p>The Trevor Project:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.thetrevorproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.thetrevorproject.org</a></p>
<p>The Transgender Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.transgenderlegal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.transgenderlegal.org</a></p>
<p>And my local branch of Planned Parenthood, because they have been extremely helpful during my own transition and I would like to be able to give back.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.plannedparenthood.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.plannedparenthood.org/</a></p>
<p>The more contributors, the bigger the donations to the three organizations.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Goodbye Frustration. </strong></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hello Beautiful Eyes!</strong></h2>
<p>The most frustrating and time-consuming part of putting on makeup, by far, is applying false eyelashes. Traditional false eyelashes are applied with glue. This glue is difficult to apply and gets where you don't want it to. It's not uncommon to glue your eyelids shut! It often ends in failure, at which point you need to clean off all the glue from your eyes and lashes and start over again. </p>
<p>Men, if you're wondering why your lady is late for your date, it's because she's fighting with her glued-on eyelashes! </p>
<p>There are newer magnetic lashes but they simply don't work! They get terrible reviews and 1 to 2 star ratings. They are nearly impossible to put on, stick out, weigh down your lashes, can pull out your natural lashes and can pinch your skin. </p>
<p> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The LashLiner System is different! </strong></h2>
<p>The LashLiner System couldn't be easier to use. The eyeliner is applied the same as any eyeliner. After applying the eyeliner, you simply hold the lashes up to the eyeliner and they smoothly ""click"" into place. That's it!</p>
<p>Have an itch on your eyelid? No problem! Just pull the lash off, scratch that itch, and put it back into place instantly! Finally, you can have lashes which are ridiculously easy to apply, comfortable enough to wear through the day, and flexible enough to adjust to your active lifestyle. </p>
<p>Our secret is the patent-pending cosmetic-grade magnetic eyeliner paired with high quality lashes embedded with incredibly strong yet tiny magnets. No glue! No sticky tape adhesive! Just beautiful eyeliner and beautiful lashes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Choose Your Style</h2>

<p>We are Lindsey and Josh and our company is Ginju Wallets.</p>
<p>We are here to launch our personalized wallet in a variety of materials, colors, and patterns.</p>
<h1>The Story</h1>
<p>As recent graduates from the University of California at Santa Barbara, we always searched for a trendy, unique wallet that was small enough to carry on the go. We noticed that a lot of students would carry around a rubber band that held their student Id’s, credit cards, and cash so that a bulky wallet did not take up more room in their already stuffed backpacks. With such busy schedules and so many things to constantly carry, we wanted an easily accessible and functional design that complemented and did not complicate our lifestyle.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/698/804/7dfc75897c220783962738ac3a28b486_large.jpg?1372144229"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>We want to offer a thin pocket-sized wallet with enough pockets and elastic straps to hold the essential cards and cash for the day. With the Ginju Wallet you won't have to carry around those unneeded receipts, extra gift cards, and heavy coin pouches because it has the perfect amount of space for all your essentials.</p>

<h1>Manufacturing</h1>
<p>After we came up with the concept for Ginju ""magic wallets,"" we were faced with the extremely difficult task of finding a manufacturer that met our high expectations of quality and efficiency. We worked very closely with our manufacturer for months tediously dissecting the design, size, and style of our wallets. </p>

<h1><strong>We Need Your Support!</strong></h1>
<p>We are really excited to launch our first project and in order to meet our funding goals, we need your support. We are doing everything we can to introduce our new wallet to friends, family, and the social media world. If you could do something as simple as share our link on facebook, like our instagram or tweet about us, our project could go a long way! We really want to drive traffic to our page and share our product with everyone! </p>
<h1><strong>Shipping Products</strong></h1>
<p>We will be ready to go into production if we have met our funding goal after the 45 day period! We have been and will continue to work closely with our manufacturer to ensure that everything runs smoothly. The production and shipment time will take a total of 35 days until we receive the wallets. Once we receive the wallets, we will ship them out ASAP to all of our amazing backers! If you need to make any adjustments to your shipping address or order, please use the comment section and we will make sure to get back to you!</p>
<h1><strong>Risks &amp; challenges</strong></h1>
<p>We have gone through several prototype revisions over the past few months refining and perfecting every aspect of our wallets from the material, to the colors and patterns, size, stitching, and printing specifications to ensure the best quality. We risk not meeting our minimum funding needs after all of the time and financial investment we have put in over the last few months. We don’t anticipate any setbacks because we have set realistic timelines and have built a strong relationship with our manufacturer. We pledge to be upfront and honest throughout the process. We will consistently post updates on the order placements, shipping times, and deadlines.</p>

<p>-Lindsey &amp; Josh</p></span></div>","Hey Indiegogo! 
We are Lindsey and Josh and our company is Ginju Wallets.
We are here to launch our personalized wallet in a variety of materials, colors, and patterns.
The Story
As recent graduates from the University of California at Santa Barbara, we always searched for a trendy, unique wallet that was small enough to carry on the go. We noticed that a lot of students would carry around a rubber band that held their student Id’s, credit cards, and cash so that a bulky wallet did not take up more room in their already stuffed backpacks. With such busy schedules and so many things to constantly carry, we wanted an easily accessible and functional design that complemented and did not complicate our lifestyle.
 

 
We want to offer a thin pocket-sized wallet with enough pockets and elastic straps to hold the essential cards and cash for the day. With the Ginju Wallet you won't have to carry around those unneeded receipts, extra gift cards, and heavy coin pouches because it has the perfect amount of space for all your essentials.
 



 
Manufacturing
After we came up with the concept for Ginju ""magic wallets,"" we were faced with the extremely difficult task of finding a manufacturer that met our high expectations of quality and efficiency. We worked very closely with our manufacturer for months tediously dissecting the design, size, and style of our wallets. 

Pre Prototype Sketches
We feel that we have selected the perfect materials, colors, and designs to make our Ginju Wallets unique. Our manufacturer hand assembles, stamps, and prints the wallets to our exact specifications. 
Your pledge will go directly towards the printing, sewing, molding, production, and final assembly cost of the wallets that we want to order on a larger scale to meet our minimum order quantity. We have spent months selecting and improving the quality and development of this wallet based upon a variety of colors and designs. We are really excited to see which wallets are most popular and to see what suggestions you have so that we can offer even more colors and patterns.

 
Rewards
Ginju Wallets are offered in a few different materials. Our Black, Dark Brown, Dark Blue, and Turquoise wallets are hand crafted out of genuine leather from one of the top leather manufacturers. Our All American wallet is crafted out of PU leather and printed with a trendy American flag design. Lastly, our Gold and Silver wallets are crafted out of a premium glitter fabric that does not rub off when you hold it.

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
<p>We are Felix, Nathanael, Philipp and Justin, all from Munich, Germany and between 20 and 25 years old. If you want to have more information <a href=""http://www.trin.do/en/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">about us</a>, visit our homepage. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s472287423.online.de/trindo/img/indie/indiegogo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>The material and production process</strong></h2>
<p>Our cases are 3d printed and made of a high quality plastic powder. They are produced on professional laser-sinter machines. The quality of the material is impressive. It is stable and flexible at the same time, making it extremely durable. This makes our safety system, the “Smartbags” and our clip-system possible, which both would not work without the special features of our material.</p>
<p>Our products are made in Germany and provide the highest quality available on the 3d-printing market.</p>
<h2><strong>Our clip-system</strong></h2>
<p>It is constructed in a way that allows switching the clip without having to take the bumper off. It´s a clever system that survives falls from great heights and it still allows for easy and fast switching of the clip.</p>
<p>Because you, our Indiegogo supporters, are the ones making this possible, you´ll be granted exclusive access to our shop and configurator before the public does. Further, you´re cases will be shipped weeks before the first official ones. Guaranteed.</p>
<h3><strong>Professional Clips</strong></h3>
<p>We will have professional designed clips in our shop. </p>
<p>Those include the city, wallet, magnet, stand and a few more at the moment. We already have the first designers onboard to bring more and more professional designed clips. Those will add awesome design and functional abilities to your phone.</p>
<p><strong>The wallet clip</strong></p>
<p>You can store your ID, drivers licence, credit cards, business cards and bills on the back of your smartphone. Your most important things stored in one place.</p>
<p>The clip can hold up to 4 cards. Even with only one card in it, everything will be safe, thanks to a clever system.</p>

<p>Our camera lenses work for every smartphone model we offer. They are attached to the clips using built-in magnets. If you choose this option, each of your clips will have an integrated magnet to attach the lenses to.</p>
<p>The Lens set includes 180° view angle Fisheye, a 2x zoom and a macro lens.</p>

<h2><strong>The Bumper and its safety functions:</strong></h2>

<p> </p>
<p>We invested most of our research time into our safety system. Our Smartbags protect the weakest spot of your smartphone, the edges. The display is protected by very small ridges in the corners, while the back is perfectly guarded by our clips. At the same time, your touch experience on the screen won´t be influenced, since the Bumper is lowered on the sides to not reach into the display.</p>
<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/66965662"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Trindo - Smartbags"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s472287423.online.de/trindo/img/indie/smartbags.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<h2><strong>Unique creations</strong></h2>
<p>You can create your own cases using our online-configurator. Not just a picture that is being printed on top. You can generate new forms within your case. This way, you can be sure that nobody else has the same case as you.</p>
<p>For ideas or examples of what is actually possible, you can take a look at our professional designs or designs made by the community or friends. You can either continue work on a design that has been shared or order it without changes. You will surely find the perfect design.</p>
<h3><strong>The configurator and its functions</strong></h3>
<p>It is still in development, but here are some screenshots illustrating what it will look like:</p>
<p>We offer the following ways of shaping:</p>
<p>-          Cutting out material to form a silhouette, e.g. the Panda<br/>-          Relief engraved, e.g. the Indiegogo clip<br/>-          Relief put on, e.g. the elephant</p>

<p>Blue, red, wine-red, violet, turquoise, yellow, lemon, pink, green, black and white can be choosen.</p>
<p>Our cases are specially coated, making them dirt repellent.</p>
<h2><strong>What do you need the money for?</strong></h2>
<p>We need the 30.000 € for the following:</p>
<p>-          cover the expenses of our 200+ prototypes<br/>-          cover the development of our configurator<br/>-          start producing in big numbers<br/>-          purchase professional equipment for post processing<br/>-          speed up designing, making more smartphone models possible</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The biggest smartphone case in the world</strong></h2>
<p>Everybody that supports us by buying one of our perks, will have his name engraved in the biggest smartphone case of the world! The case will be printed directly after our Indiegogo campaign. Every supporter will be reserved at least 1in² on the case. The attempt on the record will be handed in at Guinness World Records after successful funding.</p>
<h2><strong>Trin.do for Enterprises</strong></h2>
<p>We develop the logo of your choice together with you. We can even realize things that are not possible using the online-configurator we will offer completely new ways of designing, that couldn’t be done like that in the online-configurator, like three-dimensional objects or logos on the case. In consultation with you we can develop your own color and individual cases for every employee you can also choose, whether you want Smartbags or the clip-system. For an additional charge, we offer multicolor and the development of cases for smartphone models that we don´t offer naturally. Please contact us for further information.                                                                                                              </p>
<h2><strong>The future</strong></h2>
<p>Right now, we´re working on the following features:</p>
<p>Clips that allow for fixation on your bike or car, more gadgets (e.g. passive music amplifiers) and other crazy functions. Stay tuned ;)</p>
<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>How do I get my perk in your shop?</em></strong></p>
<p>We will send you a coupon code via e-mail. After entering the code, you will have enough credits to buy the perk you chose.</p>
<p><strong><em>I bought a new Smartphone. Do </em><em>I</em><em> have to buy all my clips a second time?</em></strong></p>
<p>Sadly, yes. Most often your “old” clips won´t fit a different smartphone model. Still, we don´t want to charge you for all of those clips that you already bought for your old smartphone. Therefore, you will be granted special discount on those that you already bought for your old smartphone. </p>
<p><strong><em>Can </em><em>I</em><em> clean my case if it gets dirty?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can easily clean it with warm water. Our cases are specially coated, which makes them easy-to-clean. You can also put them in the dishwasher to get better results. But be aware that they could lose some of their color-intensity after being washed a few times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>There is no case available for my smartphone, what can </em><em>I</em><em> do?</em></strong></p>
<p>Basically, we want to offer a wide variety of different smartphone models and are constantly working on enlarging our portfolio. We hope you understand that we won´t be creating cases for older models like the IPhone 3g/s. But you can be sure that, if we offered your model once, you will be able to buy it even years later with the newest designs. If you have a new smartphone that we do not support, and think we should do so, write us an E-Mail to: idea@trin.do. We are looking forward to your ideas and suggestions.</p>
<p><strong><em>How thick is a case?</em></strong></p>
<p>Thickness varies from model to model and from clip to clip, but is noted next to every case. We guarantee that we create our cases as thin as possible, and that thin cases are a top priority for us. An IPhone 4 case has a thickness of max. 1,8mm including the clip.</p>
<p>At the moment we are already developing much thinner cases. With the help of our smartbags we can ensure the safety of your smartphone even on extremely thin cases. We assume that this might well be so on the later delivered cases.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Is there any possibility of you NOT delivering at all?</em></strong></p>
<p>No. We will deliver. Our prototypes are already in a well advanced state. Furthermore, our partners are absolutely reliable and have lots of experience. </p>
<p><strong><em>Which payment options do you offer?</em></strong></p>
<p>During our Indiegogo campaign, you can use your credit card or PayPal. As soon as our shop is online, there will be more more payment options.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Do </em><em>I</em><em> have to adjust my designs for every smartphone model?</em></strong></p>
<p>No. We automatically scale your designs for every model. Surely there can be distortions, but those are most often minimal and not recognizable. If you choose the “share”-option to share your design with the community, your design will be automatically scaled to fit every smartphone model we offer. This way, a friend of you can choose the same design on a different smartphone.</p>
<p><strong><em>How much does the shipping cost?</em></strong></p>
<p>Shipping is free in the U.S. and the EU. Please add 4€ for the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>I may have a new smartphone in two months!</em></strong></p>
<p>This is no problem. You will choose your model not before our configurator is online in August 2013.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In August 2013, you can begin creating your cases. 14 days later the cases will be on your doorstep.</p>

<h2>Was ist Indiegogo und Crowdfunding?</h2>
<p>Für Startups bietet Crowdfunding eine gute Möglichkeit, an Kapital zu kommen. Auf der Plattform Indiegogo wird durch Vorverkäufe bestimmter Produkte Geld eingesammelt, um die Kosten für Entwicklung und Produktion decken zu können. Nach erfolreicher Finanzierung wird das Kapital für die Herstellung eingesetzt und das TrindoCase kann verschickt werden.</p>
<p>Dafür benötigen wir eure Unterstützung. Einfach einen unserer Perks auf der rechten Seite kaufen und ihr seid mit dabei. Vielen Dank an alle Leute die sich beteiligen, über uns erzählen und uns auf Facebook liken.</p>
<p>Anfang August könnt ihr euch eure Cases auf unserer Homepage erstellen.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Wer steckt dahinter?</strong></h2>
<p>Das sind wir. Felix, Nathanael, Philipp und Justin. Wir sind aus München, Deutschland und alle zwischen 20 und 25 Jahren alt. Wenn du mehr über uns erfahren möchtest, kannst du uns auf unserer Homepage besuchen. <a href=""http://www.trin.do/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.trin.do/about-us</a></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s472287423.online.de/trindo/img/indie/indiegogo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>Das Material und der Herstellungsprozess</strong></h2>
<p>Unsere Cases kommen aus dem 3D Drucker und werden auf professionellen Laser-sinter Maschinen aus einem Kunstoffpulver gefertig. Die Eigenschaften des Materials sind herausragend. Es ist stabil und flexibel zugleich, was bedeutet, dass es fast nicht kaputt zu bekommen ist. Das ermöglicht uns unser Schutzsystem, die „Smartbags“ und unser Clipsystem einzusetzen, das ohne die Eigenschaften des Materials nicht funktionieren würde.</p>
<p>Unsere Produkte sind Made in Germany und bieten die höchste Qualität, die auf dem 3d-Druck Marktverfügbar ist.</p>
<h2><strong>Unser Clipsystem</strong></h2>
<p>Unser Clipsystem wurde so entwickelt, dass du deine Designs jederzeit wechseln kannst. Ohne den Bumper entfernen zu müssen. Es ist ein ausgeklügeltes System, das bei Stürzen perfekt hält und trotzdem leicht zu wechseln ist. Ein Wechsel dauert nur wenige Sekunden.</p>
<p>Da die Sache erst durch euch, unsere Indiegogo-Unterstützer, möglich wird, erhaltet ihr einen exklusiven Zugang zu unserem Shop und dem Konfigurator vor der Öffentlichkeit. Außerdem werden eure Hüllen garantiert bereits Wochen vor den ersten offiziellen Auslieferungen versendet.</p>
<h3><strong>Professional Clips</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Wir werden in unserem Shop professionell erstellte Designs anbieten.</p>
<p>Diese schließen unter anderem die City, Geldbeutel, Magnet, Ständer und ein paar weitere Clips ein. Wir arbeiten bereits mit den ersten Designern zusammen um mehr und mehr professionelle Clips anbieten zu können. </p>
<p><strong>Der Geldbeutelclip</strong></p>
<p>Mit dem Clip kannst du Ausweis, Führerschein, EC- und Kreditkarten, Visitenkarten und Geldscheine an deinem Smartphone verstauen. Somit hast du alle wichtigen Dinge bei einer Party an einem Ort.</p>
<p>Es passen bis zu 4 Karten in den Clip. Selbst wenn du nur eine Karte unterbringst hält sie durch das ausgeklügelte System perfekt an deinem Smartphone und fliegt nicht raus.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s472287423.online.de/trindo/img/indie/DSC_0045.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Zu Beginn bieten wir folgende Städte an. Es werden im Laufe der Zeit immer mehr folgen.<strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s472287423.online.de/trindo/img/indie/cities.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Die Kameralinsen funktionieren für alle angebotenen Modelle. Sie werden magnetisch an den Clips befestigt. Wählst du die Option, so hat jeder deiner Clips einen Magnetring integriert, sodass deine Linsen befestigt werden können.</p>
<p>Das Kameralinsenset enthält eine 180° Fisheye, eine 2x Zoom und eine Makro Linse.</p>
<p><strong>Standard ohne Linse</strong></p>

<p>In unser Schutzsystem haben wir die meiste Entwicklungsarbeit investiert. Unsere Smartbags schützen die Ecken, die größten Schwachstellen deines Smartphones. Das Frontdisplay wird durch die minimalen Erhöhungen an den Ecken geschützt, die Rückseite wird perfekt durch unsere Clips geschützt. Um das Touch-Erlebnis nicht einzuschränken, sind die Bumper so konstruiert, dass sie seitlich unterhalb der Höhe des Displays liegen und somit nicht stören.</p>

<h2><strong>Eigene Kreationen</strong></h2>
<p>Du kannst deine Hüllen in unserem Online-Konfigurator selbst gestalten und entwerfen. Und zwar nicht nur irgendein Bild, das, wie bisher üblich, draufgedruckt wird, sondern bei uns entwickelst du eigene Formen. Du kannst also sicher sein, dass kein anderer auf der Welt die gleiche Hülle hat wie du.</p>
<p>Als Anregung kannst du auch vorgefertigte Designs oder Designs aus der Community oder von Freunden weiter individualisieren oder diese ohne Änderungen bestellen. Du wirst somit sicher das für dich Passende finden.</p>
<h3><strong>Der Konfigurator und seine Funktionen</strong></h3>
<p>Wir bieten folgende Optionen zur Gestaltung:</p>
<p>-          Scherenschnitt, siehe Panda<br/>-          Relief aufgetragen, siehe Elefant<br/>-          Relief eingepresst, siehe Indiegogo</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s472287423.online.de/trindo/img/indie/konf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Folgende Werkzeuge stehen dir zur Verfügung:</p>
<p>-          Stift (versch. Größen, inkl. Lineal für bessere Ergebnisse)<br/>-          Kreis (versch. Radien und Dicken)<br/>-          Spline (versch. Dicken und weitere Einstellungen zur Form)<br/>-          Radierer (versch. Größen, inkl. Lineal)<br/>-          Textwerkzeug (versch. Schriftarten, Größen und weitere Standardeinstellungen)</p>
<p>Dieser befindet sich derzeit noch in der Entwicklung. Hier sind erste Screenshots wie er aussehen wird.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s472287423.online.de/trindo/img/indie/PaintIndiegogo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Wir decken somit eigentlich alle Funktionen ab, die man aus üblichen Zeichenprogrammen kennt. Alles Online, ohne Installation von jeglicher Software.</p>
<p>Zusätzlich kann ein Bild hochgeladen werden und entweder aufgetragen oder eingepresst auf deinem Case platziert werden. Der Konfigurator wandelt das Bild in Schwarz und Weiß um. Anschließend siehst du eine Vorschau und kannst das Ergebnis an Hand von Parametern und Filtern optimieren.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>Farbauswahl</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s472287423.online.de/trindo/img/indie/DSC_0029.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s472287423.online.de/trindo/img/indie/DSC_0031.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Blau, Rot, Weinrot, Lila, Türkis, Hellgrün, Gelb, Zitronengelb, Rosa, Schwarz und Weiß stehen zur Auswahl.</p>
<p>Unsere Hüllen haben außerdem eine spezielle Beschichtung, die schmutzabweisend ist.</p>
<h2><strong>Wofür benötigt ihr die Unterstützung?</strong></h2>
<p>Wir benötigen die 30.000€ für folgende Dinge:<br/> - um die bisherigen Kosten für die über 200 Prototypen zu decken.<br/> - um die Entwicklungskosten für den Konfigurator zu decken.<br/> - um die Produktion in großen Stückzahlen starten zu können.<br/> - um professionelle Ausrüstung für die Nachbearbeitung der Hüllen kaufen zu können.<br/>- schnellere Designentwicklung um mehr Smartphone Modelle anbieten zu können.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Die größte Smartphonehülle der Welt</strong></h2>
<p>Jeder der einen Perk kauft, wird namentlich auf der größten Smartphone Hülle der Welt verewigt. Die Hülle wird direkt im Anschluss an die Indiegogokampagne erstellt. Jeder Unterstützer erhält mindestens 5cm² auf der Hülle. Der Rekordversuch wird nach der erfolgreichen Kampagne bei Guinness World Records eingereicht.</p>
<h2><strong>Trindo für Unternehmen</strong></h2>
<p>Wir entwicklen gemeinsam mit Ihnen ihr gewünschtes Logo. Dabei gibt es ganz neue Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten, die mit dem Konfigurator so nicht möglich sind, wie z.B. dreidimensional Objekte oder Logos auf dem Case. Zusammen mit ihnen können wir ihre Unternehmensfarbe erarbeiten (im Spektrum der RAL-Farben) und sogar individuelle Cases für jeden Mitarbeiter gestalten (z.B. Name des Mitarbeiters oder der Abteilung). Des Weiteren können sie wählen ob sie unsere Smartbags benötigen, und gegebenfalls diese weglassen. Es besteht auch die Möglichkeit, Hüllen ohne unser Clipsystem zu produzieren (Bumper und Clip sind dann ein Bauteil). Gegen Aufpreis bieten wir Mehrfarbigkeit und auch die Entwicklung für Smartphone Modelle an, die wir standardmäßig nicht im Shop verkaufen. Hierfür bitten wir sie mit uns in Kontakt zu treten.</p>
<h2><strong>Zukunft</strong></h2>
<p>Wir arbeiten derzeit an folgenden neuen Features:</p>
<p>Fahrrad und Autohalter, die man als Clip anstecken kann. Weitere Gadgets für Smartphones wie passive Musikverstärker und weitere verrückte Funktionen. Ihr dürft gespannt sein ;)</p>
<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Wie gelange ich an den von mir gekauften perk?</em><br/></strong></p>
<p>Du bekommst einen Gutscheincode per E-Mail von uns zugeschickt. Mit diesem bekommst du genug Guthaben in deinen Account, um dir deinen gekauften Perk in unserem Onlineshop zusammenzustellen.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ich habe ein neues Smartphone, muss ich alle </em><em>Clips erneut kaufen?</em></strong></p>
<p>Wohl oder übel Ja. Nur in den wenigsten Fällen passen Clips auf andere Modelle.<br/> Allerdings möchten wir dir natürlich nicht nochmal alle Clips in Rechnung stellen, die du für dein altes Modell schon einmal erworben hast. <br/> Deshalb erhältst du einen Sonderrabatt auf alle Clips, die du für dein altes Modell schon hattest.</p>
<p><strong><em>Was mache ich wenn mein Case schmutzig wird?</em></strong></p>
<p>Einfach mit warmen Wasser abwaschen. Unsere Cases sind speziell beschichtet, was einen Easy-to-Clean Effekt erzeugt. Bei hartnäckigeren Verschmutzungen könnt ihr die Hüllen auch einfach in die Spülmaschine legen.<br/> Nach mehreren Spülgängen können die Cases leicht an Farbintensität verlieren.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mein Smartphone wird nicht unterstützt, was kann ich tun?</em></strong></p>
<p>Prinzipiell ist es unser Ziel, ein großes Spektrum an Smartphones abzudecken und wir arbeiten auch ständig an der Erweiterung des Angebotes.<br/><br/> Wir bitten Euch um Verständnis, dass wir keine Cases mehr für alte Modelle wie das IPhone 3g/s  entwickeln. <br/> Ihr könnt Euch aber sicher sein, dass jedes Smartphonemodell, das wir mal angeboten haben, auch noch Jahre später mit den aktuellsten Designs gekauft werden kann. <br/> Falls du ein neues Modell hast, das wir deiner Meinung nach anbieten sollten dann schreibe uns einfach eine Mail an idea@trin.do<br/> Wir freuen uns über Ideen und Vorschläge.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wie dick ist ein Case?</em></strong></p>
<p>Dies variiert von Smartphonemodell zu Smartphonemodell und von Clip zu Clip.<br/> Wir garantieren Euch aber, dass wir immer an der Grenze des Machbaren arbeiten und dünne Cases für uns hohe Priorität haben.<em><br/><br/></em>Bei einem IPhone 4 beträgt die Dicke inkl. Clip max. 1,8mm. Wir entwickeln im Moment bereits Cases die deutlich dünner sind. Durch unsere Smartbags wird auch bei extrem dünnen Cases die Sicherheit deines Smartphones nicht vernachlässigt. Wir gehen davon aus, dass dies bei den später ausgelieferten Cases der Fall sein wird.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gibt es die Möglichkeit, dass ihr nicht liefern könnt?</em></strong></p>
<p>Nein. Wir werden liefern. Unsere Prototypen sind schon jetzt in einem serienreifen Stadium und unsere Partner sind absolut zuverlässig. Nach 6 Monaten sind wir uns sicher, dass wir alles so liefern können, wie es hier auf Indiegogo beschrieben ist.</p>
<p><strong><em>Was für Zahlungsmöglichkeiten habe ich?</em></strong></p>
<p>Auf Indiegogo könnt ihr mit Kreditkarte oder PayPal bezahlen. Sobald wir mit unserem Shop online gehen, sind dann mehrere Zahlungsmöglichkeiten verfügbar.</p>
<p><strong><em>Muss ich mein Design für jedes Smartphonemodell anpassen?</em></strong></p>
<p>Nein. <br/> Wir skalieren dir automatisch dein Design auf alle anderen Modelle. Natürlich kann es hier zu Verzerrungen kommen. Diese sind aber meist minimal und nicht zu erkennen. <br/> Wenn du einstellst, dass du dein Design mit der Community teilen möchtest, wird dein Design für alle Modelle automatisch skaliert.<br/> Somit kann ein Freund mit einem anderen Modell das gleiche Design tragen.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wie hoch sind die Versandkosten?</em></strong></p>
<p>Innerhalb der USA und der EU liefern wir kostenlos. Für alle anderen Länder bitten wir euch 4€ für den Versand dazuzurechnen.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ich habe in 2 Monaten vielleicht ein anders Smartphone!</em></strong></p>
<p>Das ist kein Problem. Du wählst dein Smartphonemodell erst aus wenn unser Konfigurator im August online geht.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Ab August könnt ihr Euch die Hüllen zusammenstellen. 14 Tage später liegen die Hüllen in eurem Briefkasten.</p>

About Us
We are Felix, Nathanael, Philipp and Justin, all from Munich, Germany and between 20 and 25 years old. If you want to have more information about us, visit our homepage. 

The material and production process
Our cases are 3d printed and made of a high quality plastic powder. They are produced on professional laser-sinter machines. The quality of the material is impressive. It is stable and flexible at the same time, making it extremely durable. This makes our safety system, the “Smartbags” and our clip-system possible, which both would not work without the special features of our material.
Our products are made in Germany and provide the highest quality available on the 3d-printing market.
Our clip-system
It is constructed in a way that allows switching the clip without having to take the bumper off. It´s a clever system that survives falls from great heights and it still allows for easy and fast switching of the clip.
Because you, our Indiegogo supporters, are the ones making this possible, you´ll be granted exclusive access to our shop and configurator before the public does. Further, you´re cases will be shipped weeks before the first official ones. Guaranteed.
Professional Clips
We will have professional designed clips in our shop. 
Those include the city, wallet, magnet, stand and a few more at the moment. We already have the first designers onboard to bring more and more professional designed clips. Those will add awesome design and functional abilities to your phone.
The wallet clip
You can store your ID, drivers licence, credit cards, business cards and bills on the back of your smartphone. Your most important things stored in one place.
The clip can hold up to 4 cards. Even with only one card in it, everything will be safe, thanks to a clever system.

 
The Multi-angle Standclip
Place your phone in portrait and landscape at different angles.

 
The Magnetic Clip
Stick your phone to metallic surfaces.

 
Our Cityclips
Choose your favourite cities and clip them on your smartphone.

 
 
 We will start with the following cities and add more from time to time.


 
 
Camera Lens Option
 

Our camera lenses work for every smartphone model we offer. They are attached to the clips using built-in magnets. If you choose this option, each of your clips will have an integrated magnet to attach the lenses to.
The Lens set includes 180° view angle Fisheye, a 2x zoom and a macro lens.

The Bumper and its safety functions:
 

 
 
We invested most of our research time into our safety system. Our Smartbags protect the weakest spot of your smartphone, the edges. The display is protected by very small ridges in the corners, while the back is perfectly guarded by our clips. At the same time, your touch experience on the screen won´t be influenced, since the Bumper is lowered on the sides to not reach into the display.

Unique creations
You can create your own cases using our online-configurator. Not just a picture that is being printed on top. You can generate new forms within your case. This way, you can be sure that nobody else has the same case as you.
For ideas or examples of what is actually possible, you can take a look at our professional designs or designs made by the community or friends. You can either continue work on a design that has been shared or order it without changes. You will surely find the perfect design.
The configurator and its functions
It is still in development, but here are some screenshots illustrating what it will look like:
We offer the following ways of shaping:
-          Cutting out material to form a silhouette, e.g. the Panda-          Relief engraved, e.g. the Indiegogo clip-          Relief put on, e.g. the elephant

 
 
To do this, you are equipped with the following tools:
-          Pencil (diameter, incl. a ruler for better results)-          Circle (radius and thickness)-          Spline (diameter and further settings regarding the form)-          Eraser (diameter, incl. a ruler)-          Text (fonts, sizes and further settings)
 
We´re basically covering every function you know from standard drawing software. All those feature are online, without the need to install any software.
In addition to that, you can upload an image and have it either engraved or put on. The configurator converts your image into black and white and you have a preview on how it will look on your case. You can choose different filters and settings to have the best possible result.
Colors
 


 
Blue, red, wine-red, violet, turquoise, yellow, lemon, pink, green, black and white can be choosen.
Our cases are specially coated, making them dirt repellent.
What do you need the money for?
We need the 30.000 € for the following:
-          cover the expenses of our 200+ prototypes-          cover the development of our configurator-          start producing in big numbers-          purchase professional equipment for post processing-          speed up designing, making more smartphone models possible
 
The biggest smartphone case in the world
Everybody that supports us by buying one of our perks, will have his name engraved in the biggest smartphone case of the world! The case will be printed directly after our Indiegogo campaign. Every supporter will be reserved at least 1in² on the case. The attempt on the record will be handed in at Guinness World Records after successful funding.
Trin.do for Enterprises
We develop the logo of your choice together with you. We can even realize things that are not possible using the online-configurator we will offer completely new ways of designing, that couldn’t be done like that in the online-configurator, like three-dimensional objects or logos on the case. In consultation with you we can develop your own color and individual cases for every employee you can also choose, whether you want Smartbags or the clip-system. For an additional charge, we offer multicolor and the development of cases for smartphone models that we don´t offer naturally. Please contact us for further information.                                                                                                              
The future
Right now, we´re working on the following features:
Clips that allow for fixation on your bike or car, more gadgets (e.g. passive music amplifiers) and other crazy functions. Stay tuned ;)
FAQ
How do I get my perk in your shop?
We will send you a coupon code via e-mail. After entering the code, you will have enough credits to buy the perk you chose.
I bought a new Smartphone. Do I have to buy all my clips a second time?
Sadly, yes. Most often your “old” clips won´t fit a different smartphone model. Still, we don´t want to charge you for all of those clips that you already bought for your old smartphone. Therefore, you will be granted special discount on those that you already bought for your old smartphone. 
Can I clean my case if it gets dirty?
You can easily clean it with warm water. Our cases are specially coated, which makes them easy-to-clean. You can also put them in the dishwasher to get better results. But be aware that they could lose some of their color-intensity after being washed a few times.
 
There is no case available for my smartphone, what can I do?
Basically, we want to offer a wide variety of different smartphone models and are constantly working on enlarging our portfolio. We hope you understand that we won´t be creating cases for older models like the IPhone 3g/s. But you can be sure that, if we offered your model once, you will be able to buy it even years later with the newest designs. If you have a new smartphone that we do not support, and think we should do so, write us an E-Mail to: idea@trin.do. We are looking forward to your ideas and suggestions.
How thick is a case?
Thickness varies from model to model and from clip to clip, but is noted next to every case. We guarantee that we create our cases as thin as possible, and that thin cases are a top priority for us. An IPhone 4 case has a thickness of max. 1,8mm including the clip.
At the moment we are already developing much thinner cases. With the help of our smartbags we can ensure the safety of your smartphone even on extremely thin cases. We assume that this might well be so on the later delivered cases.
 
Is there any possibility of you NOT delivering at all?
No. We will deliver. Our prototypes are already in a well advanced state. Furthermore, our partners are absolutely reliable and have lots of experience. 
Which payment options do you offer?
During our Indiegogo campaign, you can use your credit card or PayPal. As soon as our shop is online, there will be more more payment options.
 
Do I have to adjust my designs for every smartphone model?
No. We automatically scale your designs for every model. Surely there can be distortions, but those are most often minimal and not recognizable. If you choose the “share”-option to share your design with the community, your design will be automatically scaled to fit every smartphone model we offer. This way, a friend of you can choose the same design on a different smartphone.
How much does the shipping cost?
Shipping is free in the U.S. and the EU. Please add 4€ for the rest of the world.
I may have a new smartphone in two months!
This is no problem. You will choose your model not before our configurator is online in August 2013.
 
In August 2013, you can begin creating your cases. 14 days later the cases will be on your doorstep.
For further information you can visit our homepage www.trin.do or like us on Facebook – www.facebook.com/Trindo3dPrinting !
Thank you for your support!!!!

Was ist Indiegogo und Crowdfunding?
Für Startups bietet Crowdfunding eine gute Möglichkeit, an Kapital zu kommen. Auf der Plattform Indiegogo wird durch Vorverkäufe bestimmter Produkte Geld eingesammelt, um die Kosten für Entwicklung und Produktion decken zu können. Nach erfolreicher Finanzierung wird das Kapital für die Herstellung eingesetzt und das TrindoCase kann verschickt werden.
Dafür benötigen wir eure Unterstützung. Einfach einen unserer Perks auf der rechten Seite kaufen und ihr seid mit dabei. Vielen Dank an alle Leute die sich beteiligen, über uns erzählen und uns auf Facebook liken.
Anfang August könnt ihr euch eure Cases auf unserer Homepage erstellen.
 

Unterstützte Smartphone Modelle:

 
Wer steckt dahinter?
Das sind wir. Felix, Nathanael, Philipp und Justin. Wir sind aus München, Deutschland und alle zwischen 20 und 25 Jahren alt. Wenn du mehr über uns erfahren möchtest, kannst du uns auf unserer Homepage besuchen. www.trin.do/about-us

Das Material und der Herstellungsprozess
Unsere Cases kommen aus dem 3D Drucker und werden auf professionellen Laser-sinter Maschinen aus einem Kunstoffpulver gefertig. Die Eigenschaften des Materials sind herausragend. Es ist stabil und flexibel zugleich, was bedeutet, dass es fast nicht kaputt zu bekommen ist. Das ermöglicht uns unser Schutzsystem, die „Smartbags“ und unser Clipsystem einzusetzen, das ohne die Eigenschaften des Materials nicht funktionieren würde.
Unsere Produkte sind Made in Germany und bieten die höchste Qualität, die auf dem 3d-Druck Marktverfügbar ist.
Unser Clipsystem
Unser Clipsystem wurde so entwickelt, dass du deine Designs jederzeit wechseln kannst. Ohne den Bumper entfernen zu müssen. Es ist ein ausgeklügeltes System, das bei Stürzen perfekt hält und trotzdem leicht zu wechseln ist. Ein Wechsel dauert nur wenige Sekunden.
Da die Sache erst durch euch, unsere Indiegogo-Unterstützer, möglich wird, erhaltet ihr einen exklusiven Zugang zu unserem Shop und dem Konfigurator vor der Öffentlichkeit. Außerdem werden eure Hüllen garantiert bereits Wochen vor den ersten offiziellen Auslieferungen versendet.
Professional Clips
Wir werden in unserem Shop professionell erstellte Designs anbieten.
Diese schließen unter anderem die City, Geldbeutel, Magnet, Ständer und ein paar weitere Clips ein. Wir arbeiten bereits mit den ersten Designern zusammen um mehr und mehr professionelle Clips anbieten zu können. 
Der Geldbeutelclip
Mit dem Clip kannst du Ausweis, Führerschein, EC- und Kreditkarten, Visitenkarten und Geldscheine an deinem Smartphone verstauen. Somit hast du alle wichtigen Dinge bei einer Party an einem Ort.
Es passen bis zu 4 Karten in den Clip. Selbst wenn du nur eine Karte unterbringst hält sie durch das ausgeklügelte System perfekt an deinem Smartphone und fliegt nicht raus.

 
Der verstellbare Ständerclip
Stell dein Smartphone in verschiedenen Positionen hin.
 

 
Der Magnetclip
Lass dein Smartphone an metallischen Oberflächen haften.
 

 
Unsere Städteclips
Such dir deine Lieblingsstädte aus und Clip sie dir an dein Smartphone.
 

 
 
 
 
Zu Beginn bieten wir folgende Städte an. Es werden im Laufe der Zeit immer mehr folgen.

 
Kameraupgrade

 
Die Kameralinsen funktionieren für alle angebotenen Modelle. Sie werden magnetisch an den Clips befestigt. Wählst du die Option, so hat jeder deiner Clips einen Magnetring integriert, sodass deine Linsen befestigt werden können.
Das Kameralinsenset enthält eine 180° Fisheye, eine 2x Zoom und eine Makro Linse.
Standard ohne Linse

Der Bumper und seine Schutzfunktionen
 


In unser Schutzsystem haben wir die meiste Entwicklungsarbeit investiert. Unsere Smartbags schützen die Ecken, die größten Schwachstellen deines Smartphones. Das Frontdisplay wird durch die minimalen Erhöhungen an den Ecken geschützt, die Rückseite wird perfekt durch unsere Clips geschützt. Um das Touch-Erlebnis nicht einzuschränken, sind die Bumper so konstruiert, dass sie seitlich unterhalb der Höhe des Displays liegen und somit nicht stören.

Eigene Kreationen
Du kannst deine Hüllen in unserem Online-Konfigurator selbst gestalten und entwerfen. Und zwar nicht nur irgendein Bild, das, wie bisher üblich, draufgedruckt wird, sondern bei uns entwickelst du eigene Formen. Du kannst also sicher sein, dass kein anderer auf der Welt die gleiche Hülle hat wie du.
Als Anregung kannst du auch vorgefertigte Designs oder Designs aus der Community oder von Freunden weiter individualisieren oder diese ohne Änderungen bestellen. Du wirst somit sicher das für dich Passende finden.
Der Konfigurator und seine Funktionen
Wir bieten folgende Optionen zur Gestaltung:
-          Scherenschnitt, siehe Panda-          Relief aufgetragen, siehe Elefant-          Relief eingepresst, siehe Indiegogo

 
Folgende Werkzeuge stehen dir zur Verfügung:
-          Stift (versch. Größen, inkl. Lineal für bessere Ergebnisse)-          Kreis (versch. Radien und Dicken)-          Spline (versch. Dicken und weitere Einstellungen zur Form)-          Radierer (versch. Größen, inkl. Lineal)-          Textwerkzeug (versch. Schriftarten, Größen und weitere Standardeinstellungen)
Dieser befindet sich derzeit noch in der Entwicklung. Hier sind erste Screenshots wie er aussehen wird.

Wir decken somit eigentlich alle Funktionen ab, die man aus üblichen Zeichenprogrammen kennt. Alles Online, ohne Installation von jeglicher Software.
Zusätzlich kann ein Bild hochgeladen werden und entweder aufgetragen oder eingepresst auf deinem Case platziert werden. Der Konfigurator wandelt das Bild in Schwarz und Weiß um. Anschließend siehst du eine Vorschau und kannst das Ergebnis an Hand von Parametern und Filtern optimieren.
 
Farbauswahl
 


Blau, Rot, Weinrot, Lila, Türkis, Hellgrün, Gelb, Zitronengelb, Rosa, Schwarz und Weiß stehen zur Auswahl.
Unsere Hüllen haben außerdem eine spezielle Beschichtung, die schmutzabweisend ist.
Wofür benötigt ihr die Unterstützung?
Wir benötigen die 30.000€ für folgende Dinge: - um die bisherigen Kosten für die über 200 Prototypen zu decken. - um die Entwicklungskosten für den Konfigurator zu decken. - um die Produktion in großen Stückzahlen starten zu können. - um professionelle Ausrüstung für die Nachbearbeitung der Hüllen kaufen zu können.- schnellere Designentwicklung um mehr Smartphone Modelle anbieten zu können.
 
Die größte Smartphonehülle der Welt
Jeder der einen Perk kauft, wird namentlich auf der größten Smartphone Hülle der Welt verewigt. Die Hülle wird direkt im Anschluss an die Indiegogokampagne erstellt. Jeder Unterstützer erhält mindestens 5cm² auf der Hülle. Der Rekordversuch wird nach der erfolgreichen Kampagne bei Guinness World Records eingereicht.
Trindo für Unternehmen
Wir entwicklen gemeinsam mit Ihnen ihr gewünschtes Logo. Dabei gibt es ganz neue Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten, die mit dem Konfigurator so nicht möglich sind, wie z.B. dreidimensional Objekte oder Logos auf dem Case. Zusammen mit ihnen können wir ihre Unternehmensfarbe erarbeiten (im Spektrum der RAL-Farben) und sogar individuelle Cases für jeden Mitarbeiter gestalten (z.B. Name des Mitarbeiters oder der Abteilung). Des Weiteren können sie wählen ob sie unsere Smartbags benötigen, und gegebenfalls diese weglassen. Es besteht auch die Möglichkeit, Hüllen ohne unser Clipsystem zu produzieren (Bumper und Clip sind dann ein Bauteil). Gegen Aufpreis bieten wir Mehrfarbigkeit und auch die Entwicklung für Smartphone Modelle an, die wir standardmäßig nicht im Shop verkaufen. Hierfür bitten wir sie mit uns in Kontakt zu treten.
Zukunft
Wir arbeiten derzeit an folgenden neuen Features:
Fahrrad und Autohalter, die man als Clip anstecken kann. Weitere Gadgets für Smartphones wie passive Musikverstärker und weitere verrückte Funktionen. Ihr dürft gespannt sein ;)
FAQs
Wie gelange ich an den von mir gekauften perk?
Du bekommst einen Gutscheincode per E-Mail von uns zugeschickt. Mit diesem bekommst du genug Guthaben in deinen Account, um dir deinen gekauften Perk in unserem Onlineshop zusammenzustellen.
Ich habe ein neues Smartphone, muss ich alle Clips erneut kaufen?
Wohl oder übel Ja. Nur in den wenigsten Fällen passen Clips auf andere Modelle. Allerdings möchten wir dir natürlich nicht nochmal alle Clips in Rechnung stellen, die du für dein altes Modell schon einmal erworben hast.  Deshalb erhältst du einen Sonderrabatt auf alle Clips, die du für dein altes Modell schon hattest.
Was mache ich wenn mein Case schmutzig wird?
Einfach mit warmen Wasser abwaschen. Unsere Cases sind speziell beschichtet, was einen Easy-to-Clean Effekt erzeugt. Bei hartnäckigeren Verschmutzungen könnt ihr die Hüllen auch einfach in die Spülmaschine legen. Nach mehreren Spülgängen können die Cases leicht an Farbintensität verlieren.
 
Mein Smartphone wird nicht unterstützt, was kann ich tun?
Prinzipiell ist es unser Ziel, ein großes Spektrum an Smartphones abzudecken und wir arbeiten auch ständig an der Erweiterung des Angebotes. Wir bitten Euch um Verständnis, dass wir keine Cases mehr für alte Modelle wie das IPhone 3g/s  entwickeln.  Ihr könnt Euch aber sicher sein, dass jedes Smartphonemodell, das wir mal angeboten haben, auch noch Jahre später mit den aktuellsten Designs gekauft werden kann.  Falls du ein neues Modell hast, das wir deiner Meinung nach anbieten sollten dann schreibe uns einfach eine Mail an idea@trin.do Wir freuen uns über Ideen und Vorschläge.
Wie dick ist ein Case?
Dies variiert von Smartphonemodell zu Smartphonemodell und von Clip zu Clip. Wir garantieren Euch aber, dass wir immer an der Grenze des Machbaren arbeiten und dünne Cases für uns hohe Priorität haben.Bei einem IPhone 4 beträgt die Dicke inkl. Clip max. 1,8mm. Wir entwickeln im Moment bereits Cases die deutlich dünner sind. Durch unsere Smartbags wird auch bei extrem dünnen Cases die Sicherheit deines Smartphones nicht vernachlässigt. Wir gehen davon aus, dass dies bei den später ausgelieferten Cases der Fall sein wird.
Gibt es die Möglichkeit, dass ihr nicht liefern könnt?
Nein. Wir werden liefern. Unsere Prototypen sind schon jetzt in einem serienreifen Stadium und unsere Partner sind absolut zuverlässig. Nach 6 Monaten sind wir uns sicher, dass wir alles so liefern können, wie es hier auf Indiegogo beschrieben ist.
Was für Zahlungsmöglichkeiten habe ich?
Auf Indiegogo könnt ihr mit Kreditkarte oder PayPal bezahlen. Sobald wir mit unserem Shop online gehen, sind dann mehrere Zahlungsmöglichkeiten verfügbar.
Muss ich mein Design für jedes Smartphonemodell anpassen?
Nein.  Wir skalieren dir automatisch dein Design auf alle anderen Modelle. Natürlich kann es hier zu Verzerrungen kommen. Diese sind aber meist minimal und nicht zu erkennen.  Wenn du einstellst, dass du dein Design mit der Community teilen möchtest, wird dein Design für alle Modelle automatisch skaliert. Somit kann ein Freund mit einem anderen Modell das gleiche Design tragen.
Wie hoch sind die Versandkosten?
Innerhalb der USA und der EU liefern wir kostenlos. Für alle anderen Länder bitten wir euch 4€ für den Versand dazuzurechnen.
Ich habe in 2 Monaten vielleicht ein anders Smartphone!
Das ist kein Problem. Du wählst dein Smartphonemodell erst aus wenn unser Konfigurator im August online geht.
 
Ab August könnt ihr Euch die Hüllen zusammenstellen. 14 Tage später liegen die Hüllen in eurem Briefkasten.

<p><strong>Was there a science to the design?</strong></p>
<p>The only thing my dad was thinking was fun, useful, entertaining for the child and it HAD to smell nice.</p>
<p><em>Science, no… Practical, yes!</em></p>
<p><strong>But first, it’s important to understand some baby facts:</strong></p>
<ul><li>All babies poop ---- Sorry, it’s true… not one doesn’t!</li></ul>
<ul><li>All babies pee ---- Ditto to the above fact… Sorry again!</li></ul>
<p><strong>Can people stimulate a baby’s Eye Development?</strong></p>
<p>It is critical that in the first year, a baby’s brain and eyes begin to coordinate images and remember what they’ve seen. As a parent, they participate in the newborn’s eye development and health as a normal part of your time with your baby. Proper stimulation can increase curiosity, attention span, memory, and nervous system development.</p>
<p>So be sure to give your baby plenty of interesting things to see… LIKE The PooPee Mask!</p>
<p><strong>The First Three Months of Eye Development</strong></p>
<p>Newborns can only focus about 8 - 12 inches from their face, and they see only black, white and gray. Over the next 10 - 12 weeks, babies will follow moving objects and recognizing things, bold, geometric patterns.</p>
<p><strong>When Do Babies Begin To See Clearly?</strong></p>
<p>Depth perception and eye-hand coordination begin to develop when infants reach four months. From four to six months, babies will begin to reach out and touch an object – something that previously only happened by chance.</p>
<p>Is the PooPee Mask a proven method to stimulate a baby’s eye and muscle development?</p>
<p><b>We have absolutely NO scientific proof</b>, however, we have a whole lot of happy diaper changers who don’t cringe, but smile every time they have to do the task and enjoy the newness of life.</p>
<p><strong>So, what we do know?</strong></p>
<p>We know it’s a fun thing to wear when changing diapers and seeing that little tyke smiling, pointing at the dots and what’s really nice -- you’re smelling strawberries!</p>

<h1>Where will the money go?</h1>
<p>Brianna will use funds to get the business going and pay for her second year of college.  If she does meet and exceed her funds she’ll continue to use for the balance of her schooling. </p>
<p>Brianna is on route to graduate with a Psychology degree with a goal of becoming a teacher and working with kids.</p>
<p>She has worked since she was 16 in retail and will continue to remain at her position.  Providing this works well, she may continue this business through her entire college life!  Her dad would really like that!</p>
<p><strong>Could we ship thousands?</strong></p>
<p><b>YES</b>, in fact my dad said if I sold millions, he’d find a way to ship, deliver best of quality and make those million diaper changers out there very happy!</p>
<p><strong>Production &amp; Shipping</strong></p>
<p>If our goal is met, we’ll make sure everything goes according to plan to ship quickly. As soon as funding is complete, PooPee Masks &amp; PooPee Diaper Cakes will begin shipping within 10 business days.</p>
<p>Expected shipping dates begin approximately 10 days after funding time has ended.  We want to make sure you have your PooPee Masks and PooPee Diaper Cakes as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>Moving from an in-house operation to a full-scale business servicing retailers and end users requires careful planning and controlled growth. On time delivery, customer service and accurate fulfillment will be some of the most significant activities to maintain.</p>

Was there a science to the design?
The only thing my dad was thinking was fun, useful, entertaining for the child and it HAD to smell nice.
Science, no… Practical, yes!
But first, it’s important to understand some baby facts:
All babies poop ---- Sorry, it’s true… not one doesn’t!
All babies pee ---- Ditto to the above fact… Sorry again!
Can people stimulate a baby’s Eye Development?
It is critical that in the first year, a baby’s brain and eyes begin to coordinate images and remember what they’ve seen. As a parent, they participate in the newborn’s eye development and health as a normal part of your time with your baby. Proper stimulation can increase curiosity, attention span, memory, and nervous system development.
So be sure to give your baby plenty of interesting things to see… LIKE The PooPee Mask!
The First Three Months of Eye Development
Newborns can only focus about 8 - 12 inches from their face, and they see only black, white and gray. Over the next 10 - 12 weeks, babies will follow moving objects and recognizing things, bold, geometric patterns.
When Do Babies Begin To See Clearly?
Depth perception and eye-hand coordination begin to develop when infants reach four months. From four to six months, babies will begin to reach out and touch an object – something that previously only happened by chance.
Is the PooPee Mask a proven method to stimulate a baby’s eye and muscle development?
We have absolutely NO scientific proof, however, we have a whole lot of happy diaper changers who don’t cringe, but smile every time they have to do the task and enjoy the newness of life.
So, what we do know?
We know it’s a fun thing to wear when changing diapers and seeing that little tyke smiling, pointing at the dots and what’s really nice -- you’re smelling strawberries!

Does it work? YES
Is it one of the best newborn gifts for a parent, sister, brother or grandparent?
…An emphatic YES!

FAQ’s
What colors are on the PooPee Mask?
Blue & Pink
Do I get a preference of colors?
We picked neutral colors so that both work well and do the same job, which is to laugh, smell strawberry & occupy that little beauty.
What is the smell again?
The smell of strawberry is filled within each PooPee Mask
What material is the PooPee Mask made out of?
The PooPee Mask is made 100% Polypropylene non-woven fabric.
Do you offer any warranty?

What did Regis & Kathy Lee do with the PooPee Mask?
My dad was told by a production assistant, with the show at that time that Mr. Philbin himself tried the PooPee Mask on prior to a show airing in 1998.  It almost made the cut but was never on air.
What did Paul Reiser do with the PooPee Mask?
My dad was told that Mr. Reiser tried the PooPee Mask on and that is all.  It did not make it into an actual show.
How many PooPee Masks come in each package?
There are two (2) PooPee Masks per package.
How long does the PooPee Mask last?

What has Delta done?  


While still in high school, Delta began designing dresses for friends.  


At age 13, she took sewing lessons at the local community college, to learn basic construction and patterning skills.  


Delta interned with Mitra Chester, at her fashion store ""Deluxe"" in Eugene, OR, spending many hours learning to remake, repurpose, and create new designs.  


Delta participated in all her high school's theatrical productions, as an actress and dancer, but becoming the department's costume designer.


Last summer, Delta showed four of her own design creations in a downtown runway show put on by Deluxe and Redoux, another fashion shop in Eugene.  This was Delta's first experience of showing her own line ""Starchild Designs"", and included choosing her models, fitting her designs to them, and choosing makeup, hair, accessories, and shoes to create a themed showing...in her case, ""Mardi Gras"", speaking to her Cajun heritage.  



 Because of Delta's stellar high school career, (National Honor Society, college credit courses, 3.87 GPA), as well as her art portfolio, she was accepted into every fashion program she applied to, with many scholarships offered, and has her heart set on attending California College of the Arts. 

CCA has one of the top 10 Fashion Design programs in the US, and it's graduates have the eyes of the fashion industry.  CCA's graduates come out of their program having interned with top fashion houses in the San Francisco Bay Area and are frequently hired into positions with great career potential.  One of the things Delta particularly likes about CCA is the strong focus on sustainability, in choice and sourcing of materials and fabrics, in social issues of manufacturing, and in working on designs with depth and importance in future world needs for outerwear, wearability, and new and exciting developments in fabrics that can change with the environment. 

So why isn't Delta already at CCA? 
Though she was accepted as a freshman to CCA a year ago, with over $17,000 in scholarships and enough additional financial aid to cover her tuition and fees, there was nothing left over for living expenses in the expensive Bay Area.  I am a low-income mother, supporting a family of 5, including some with disabilities, and I simply don't have the ability to finance college for her.  We are barely making ends meet and there simply is no ""extra"".
Since the first year program at CCA is primarily studio art and art history, with the Fashion Design major beginning in sophomore year, Delta made the  choice to attend our local University of Oregon, where she had also been offered a ""full-ride"" in scholarships.  Delta was determined to prepare for transferring to CCA as a sophomore. She took studio art, dance, art history, and excelled in all of these. She also spent her year working in U of O's famed and prestigious Costume Shop with Alexandra Bonds, who directs a renowned Costume Design program.  Delta worked on costuming for five major productions in a large theater shop with industrial equipment.  While there, she gained all she could in sewing skills, design, working with delicate and challenging fabrics, and construction.
However, while it is an excellent university, and we love our Ducks, U of O doesn't have a Fashion Design program, and Eugene, Oregon isn't San Francisco when it comes to being in a major creative world center.

Delta is so grateful for any help and wants to give you a little ""piece"" of her art in return.   Depending on the size of your contribution, you may receive anything from a postcard of her original art to a fashion sketch just for you!  Check out the great ""perks""!
Where Will the Money Go?
Every dollar you contribute will go towards meeting Delta's tuition, fees, and book expenses.  If we are able to raise more than what she needs for this, then what is left will go towards her rent in the Bay Area, reducing her loan debt when she graduates.
What if We Don't Reach the Goal?
As Delta's mother, I KNOW what she has to offer the world, and I KNOW how incredibly powerful she is!  I would be heartbroken to see Delta unable to go to the college she has worked so hard for, because I can't afford to send her, but if it's not enough to make the dream happen this year, it would go into an account to start her savings for next year and Delta would continue to take studio art and costume design at U of O for one more year, while working to save the rest of what she needs.  BUT...in case this sounds like an easy goal, there is no guarantee Delta would be offered the same aid package next year to CCA if she doesn't begin her studies there. Delta will work on her portfolio and scholarship applications even harder, but it would feel like a waste of a year--a BIG deal for a 19 year old!
YOUR Impact!
YOU get to participate in helping a young person reach for a vision!  Imagine, seeing ""Starchild Designs"" making a difference in how clothing is produced, for example, or changing how people feel about themselves and the bodies they have, and KNOWING YOU HELPED IT HAPPEN!  Or, just see the look on Delta's face as she goes into her first design class, joins her first intern project, or GRADUATES with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Fashion Design from a top college!  


Other Ways You Can Help
Every single dollar is appreciated, and is a ""stitch"" in the fabric of Delta's future... NO donation is too small!  AND...there are other ways to help.  Please share this campaign with everyone you know! 
                                                       It takes a village, right?  If you contribute $5 and then go out and get 9 more people to contribute $5, you've brought Delta $50!  And then if THEY each get 10 people to contribute $5, then you've helped bring Delta $500!!!  See how this works?  
So share on Facebook, Twitter, email...tell your friends.  USE the tools at the top of this campaign to share for even more visibility!  It's easy!",13.0,0,"13 Campaigns

<p>We are selling t-shirts with unique and handcrafted designs to fundraise for our field trips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every year,  our middle school participates in a project called Maker Immersion Week. We take this whole week to focus on raising funds for unique trips that take place during the curriculum. During the week, we learn new skills, create designs, and build foundations for our future business careers. This year, our funds are going towards a three-day trip to the Mt. Lemmon Sky Center Observatory. The products we're selling are t-shirts with designs made by the students. These students practiced business skills as well as creative thinking to generate designs for our t-shirts, as well as marketing. While making our shirts, the students learned to follow the process of screen printing, as well as patience and incorporating teamwork. The students printed these t-shirts to provide a creative and beneficial way to fundraise for our program.</p>

<p><b>Kaley Combee</b> graduated from University of Central Florida with a degree in Interpersonal and Organizational Communication. She is also a writer, who also happens to have a great mind for marketing and business strategies. So, of course she handles the business side of the company.</p>
<h2><b>WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES...</b></h2>
<p>In a large hole in the ground where we'll horde it to create a genetically enhanced race of vampire bats that will be used to take over the world.</p>
<p><b>OR...</b></p>
<p>1. The money raised here will be used to kick start the company into high gear and allow us to purchase the products (shoes, hats, T-shirts, paint, pens, pencils, brushes, paper, printer ink, fabric pens, labels, tissue paper, shipping boxes, and anything else) needed to create our one of a kind merchandise.</p>
<p>2. The funds will also go toward updating and maintaining our website for the business, which will allow us to reach a broader customer base and allow for easier purchasing. Currently, our website is a bare bones, functional website but we want to be able to have an extensive website that allows for an overall easier browsing/purchasing experience for our customers. As of right now, we resort to using E-BAY and other selling sites of the same ilk.</p>
<p>Link to our current website: <a href=""http://www.theexquisitecorpsecreations.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theexquisitecorpsecreations.com</a></p>
<p>3. The contributions we receive will also help to compensate for the purchase of our LLC. We have filed the paper work to ensure we are a legitimate business but the extraneous and hidden fees to do this continue to pile up in our mailbox. We want to establish a legitimate business to make our customers feel safe in their transactions with us and the best way to do this is to become an LLC, and the only way to have this happen is to keep paying the fees and eventually reach our goal.</p>
<p>4. Your donations will also be used to create an extensive advertising campaign that sets up an expansive network that lets us connect on a personal level with our customers and followers. This campaign will include social media but also grass roots marketing. Your money will afford us the opportunity to purchase advertising space in various horror magazines, purchase flyers, artwork, and etc. to distribute both locally and across the United States. We want to share our passion for this company with all the others who share a love for the spooky and grotesque side of cinema, books, and art.</p>
<p>4. The contributions we receive will go toward funding a booth and products for the horror convention <b>Spooky Empire</b> that is held in Orlando, Fl, every year. It is a great business opportunity for us, as far as, generating new customers, selling product, networking, and meeting the customers, we value so much, face to face. Our ultimate goal for this business is to make great products people will love but also to meet people and have fun. We also want to show them our passion for our products but also our passion for people and horror. At Spooky Empire, we will also be donating a $1, from every sell made, to a charity we are creating to benefit the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation. The foundation is called <b>Naya's Journey,</b> which we started after interacting with one of our first customers, when we discovered she had a daughter who suffered from cerebral palsy and we wanted to try and help by using our business as a platform to help raise money and awareness for Cerebral Palsy.<br/></p>

Our brains went into overdrive creating merchandise that received enormous positive feedback. We are still counting all the Facebook and Instagram likes, while receiving inquiries and orders.
But there is one problem... Yep, you guessed it. Money. Greenbacks. The root of all evil. The more you have of it the less you spend. That stuff we all need.
Now, we are here to illicit the help of all horror lovers and others, as well! With the money earned here, we will create all the wonderfully creepy merchandise so many people have either loved, bought, swooned over, or told us they wanted to buy in the very near future.
With your generous help we can expand our small, but audacious business and take over the world.
THIS IS US...

HUGE Horror Fanatics, Netflix Lovers, Competitive Board Game Players, Sports Enthusiasts, Hardcore Nerds, Proud Parents, & Engaged. 
Jeremy Tidwell graduated from University of North Florida with a degree in Literature and Film. He is a self taught artist who also dabbles in film making and writing. He creates every piece for The Exquisite Corpse Creations by hand.
Kaley Combee graduated from University of Central Florida with a degree in Interpersonal and Organizational Communication. She is also a writer, who also happens to have a great mind for marketing and business strategies. So, of course she handles the business side of the company.
WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES...
In a large hole in the ground where we'll horde it to create a genetically enhanced race of vampire bats that will be used to take over the world.
OR...
1. The money raised here will be used to kick start the company into high gear and allow us to purchase the products (shoes, hats, T-shirts, paint, pens, pencils, brushes, paper, printer ink, fabric pens, labels, tissue paper, shipping boxes, and anything else) needed to create our one of a kind merchandise.
2. The funds will also go toward updating and maintaining our website for the business, which will allow us to reach a broader customer base and allow for easier purchasing. Currently, our website is a bare bones, functional website but we want to be able to have an extensive website that allows for an overall easier browsing/purchasing experience for our customers. As of right now, we resort to using E-BAY and other selling sites of the same ilk.
Link to our current website: www.theexquisitecorpsecreations.com
3. The contributions we receive will also help to compensate for the purchase of our LLC. We have filed the paper work to ensure we are a legitimate business but the extraneous and hidden fees to do this continue to pile up in our mailbox. We want to establish a legitimate business to make our customers feel safe in their transactions with us and the best way to do this is to become an LLC, and the only way to have this happen is to keep paying the fees and eventually reach our goal.
4. Your donations will also be used to create an extensive advertising campaign that sets up an expansive network that lets us connect on a personal level with our customers and followers. This campaign will include social media but also grass roots marketing. Your money will afford us the opportunity to purchase advertising space in various horror magazines, purchase flyers, artwork, and etc. to distribute both locally and across the United States. We want to share our passion for this company with all the others who share a love for the spooky and grotesque side of cinema, books, and art.
4. The contributions we receive will go toward funding a booth and products for the horror convention Spooky Empire that is held in Orlando, Fl, every year. It is a great business opportunity for us, as far as, generating new customers, selling product, networking, and meeting the customers, we value so much, face to face. Our ultimate goal for this business is to make great products people will love but also to meet people and have fun. We also want to show them our passion for our products but also our passion for people and horror. At Spooky Empire, we will also be donating a $1, from every sell made, to a charity we are creating to benefit the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation. The foundation is called Naya's Journey, which we started after interacting with one of our first customers, when we discovered she had a daughter who suffered from cerebral palsy and we wanted to try and help by using our business as a platform to help raise money and awareness for Cerebral Palsy.
This is the logo for our foundation...



Important links for items mentioned above:

 http://www.ucp.org
5. Money raised here will also fund future work, which will include more products and travel expenses to different conventions where we can showcase our product and generate more interest and new customers, which gives us the chance to have a great time meeting new people and just sharing our mutual love for horror!
AND TO THE END OF ALL THINGS...
So there it is boys, ghouls and other cool people. This is our campaign. Our proposal. We hope that something written or shown here has inspired you to donate or even just share the word. This is our business. Our company. Our life. We want to see it succeed in every way possible and we want friends, valued customers, online community, and kick ass people to be involved in this journey. 
We are the Exquisite Corpse. Join us.
And as always, Stay Spooky!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>SAVIOR WATCHES | THE VERY 1ST CHRISTIAN BASED ECO-FRIENDLY WOODEN WATCHES MADE FROM BIBLICAL MATERIALS FROM THE HOLY LAND</h1>
<p>OUR SAVIOR WATCHES, Based in the USA, are made of premium, authentic eco-friendly wood imported directly from the City of Nazareth, the town Jesus was from. We hand select all premium materials used, offering our customers the finest quality merchandise available. Each piece is handcrafted for a unique finish and exclusivity. Our ethos is authentic religious sustainability; we consciously incorporate an image on all packaging to symbolize the love and admiration towards our God.</p>
<p>We are a team of designers, musicians and athletes from California who accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. Our main goal is to inspire others to walk the same righteous path the Lord paved for us with encouraging words He left for us engraved on the backs of each watch.</p>

</div><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We don't think, we know that our premium, authentic handpicked wood from the religious holy land is a more versatile material compared to regular wood. It's stronger and visually more detailed than most trees. For our packaging, we thought an eco-friendly custom designed recycled box would be the best fit for this watch complete with passages from the bible printed inside and out.</span><br/></p><p>Our designer worked side by side with our engineers for over year making sure that every detail of this watch is met. The elegance and nature of this watch was something that could not be kept lightly and had to be done with it's highest integrity. Inside and out, every aspect of Savior Watches had to go hand in hand. To maintain the wood's natural aesthetic, we decided to use natural oils and bee’s wax to give it a nice clean finish.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445713041/ucynraxmhgyi4eearxda.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FNhhLA6W4gZw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNhhLA6W4gZw%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FNhhLA6W4gZw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><div>
<h3>100% Wrist-Friendly Designs!</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When designing the watches, our main ethos was to produce a 100% ""Wrist-friendly"" authentic product so all metal screws have been countersunk and we have included a Scratch Resistant Mineral Crystal to protect the face of the time piece.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445713154/mltzkzx6wy00askh1dfu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>To give the watch’s dial more of a rich look, we chose onyx, a stone referenced in the bible several times which gave the face more of a thick / durable look.</p>
<p><b>EXODUS 28:9-</b> <i>""You shall take two <b>onyx stones</b>, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel...""</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p></p>

<p>Passages from the bible have been placed throughout the packaging as well as the back casing of the watch. For the Rejoice watch, we wanted to share Luke 1:47 which says... <i><b>""and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,""</b></i> a perfect passage to share with others to let them know the joy God gives us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445713402/rty0qrkbau4rnlkjgwje.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To make the clasp, back casing and number marks really pop, we plated the stainless steel gold which compliments the wood giving the watch an opulent look.</p>
<p>The handcrafted case for the <i>Rejoice Watch</i> is 100% original, you will not see any watches like this in the market. Originality is something we at Savior Watches stand strong in with these statement pieces giving you, the customer, that strong sense of being in a class all by itself.</p>

OUR SAVIOR WATCHES, Based in the USA, are made of premium, authentic eco-friendly wood imported directly from the City of Nazareth, the town Jesus was from. We hand select all premium materials used, offering our customers the finest quality merchandise available. Each piece is handcrafted for a unique finish and exclusivity. Our ethos is authentic religious sustainability; we consciously incorporate an image on all packaging to symbolize the love and admiration towards our God.
We are a team of designers, musicians and athletes from California who accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. Our main goal is to inspire others to walk the same righteous path the Lord paved for us with encouraging words He left for us engraved on the backs of each watch.


EZEKIEL 27:15 ""Merchants came to you from Dedan. Numerous coastlands were your captive markets; they brought payment in ivory tusks and ebony wood.”




I KINGS 6:31""And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.""

   Why do we think OUR SAVIOR WATCHES are superior to similar wooden products? 
We don't think, we know that our premium, authentic handpicked wood from the religious holy land is a more versatile material compared to regular wood. It's stronger and visually more detailed than most trees. For our packaging, we thought an eco-friendly custom designed recycled box would be the best fit for this watch complete with passages from the bible printed inside and out.Our designer worked side by side with our engineers for over year making sure that every detail of this watch is met. The elegance and nature of this watch was something that could not be kept lightly and had to be done with it's highest integrity. Inside and out, every aspect of Savior Watches had to go hand in hand. To maintain the wood's natural aesthetic, we decided to use natural oils and bee’s wax to give it a nice clean finish.
100% Wrist-Friendly Designs! 
When designing the watches, our main ethos was to produce a 100% ""Wrist-friendly"" authentic product so all metal screws have been countersunk and we have included a Scratch Resistant Mineral Crystal to protect the face of the time piece.



To give the watch’s dial more of a rich look, we chose onyx, a stone referenced in the bible several times which gave the face more of a thick / durable look.
EXODUS 28:9- ""You shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel...""



Passages from the bible have been placed throughout the packaging as well as the back casing of the watch. For the Rejoice watch, we wanted to share Luke 1:47 which says... ""and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,"" a perfect passage to share with others to let them know the joy God gives us.



To make the clasp, back casing and number marks really pop, we plated the stainless steel gold which compliments the wood giving the watch an opulent look.
The handcrafted case for the Rejoice Watch is 100% original, you will not see any watches like this in the market. Originality is something we at Savior Watches stand strong in with these statement pieces giving you, the customer, that strong sense of being in a class all by itself.



   
TimelineWood Importing: November (Ships from Nazareth, Israel by Sea)-Wood sent from initial campaign with extra to fulfill an additional run.-If Indiegogo exceeds in high numbers, additional wood will be shipped via air.Production Starts: DecemberProduction Ends: Early MarchQuality Control / Shipping: End of MarchRisks and challengesWe have spent an entire year working with our manufacturer to make this beautiful time piece. Both supplier and manufacturer understands the great importance of meeting our delivery dates as they know how meeting ship dates are crucial for retail chains. Our supplier and manufacturer have been in communications with each other for half a year now and we now have a comfortable game plan to execute once we hit production.The only challenges we face that would delay the process of production would be any random acts of God and disasters.

<p><span>I am 78 years old. My friends tell me I am probably one of the oldest entrepreneurs in America. They also tell me I may be one of the best looking, but they might be a little biased ;)</span></p>
<p>At the sunset of my life, I have become increasingly obsessed with leaving my mark on the world, but not in the same way a dog leaves his mark on the world. I wanted to do something more helpful and less bodily-function related. So, ten years ago when I learned that 80% to 90% of bad breath comes from a dirty tongue, I invented the Orabrush, the tongue cleaner that helps cure bad breath. </p>
<p>Soon after launching Orabrush, customers started asking for a doggy Orabrush. Orapup was born. </p>
</div>
<h2>Orapup - Dog Breath Brush</h2>
<p><span>But how do you get a dog to let you clean its tongue? You don’t! You let the dog do it.</span><span> I designed Orapup's licking surface to be large enough for big dogs and for small dogs—and this was the brilliant part—all dogs in between.<br/><br/></span></p>
<p>Consider the perfect design and construction of this, the new best friend to man’s best friend.</p>

<p>*Note:The colors in these pictures are only a representation from the 3D model. They don't look near as vibrant as the real thing. </p>
<p><strong>Ultra-soft Bristles:</strong> Ultra-soft, pointed bristles clean deep into the uneven crevices of your dog’s tongue loosening stinky bacteria. I borrowed the bristle design from the surgeon's scrub brush, the same special bristles surgeons use to clean bacteria from their hands before they cut you open (sorry for the gross visual there).</p>
<p><strong>Inline Scrapers:</strong> Four inline scrapers collect and remove the bacteria and residue generated from brushing, helping cure bad breath. I made the scapers obscure enough your dog won't even notice them, but they get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>Handle Tilt:</strong> I tried loads of different handles until I had the perfect handle. It enables the dog to lick the Orapup in the vertical position. This is the position where the dog will extend the full length of it's tongue. It also keeps your hands from getting licked.</p>
<p><strong>Flavor Packs: </strong>When we clean our own tongues or brush our teeth, we pull the bad breath causing gunk out of our mouth and then spit out the residue. Dogs don’t spit. I spent 8 months researching a flavor and consistency that dogs love and is completely edible and healthy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tastes like beef brisket</strong></li>
<li><strong>FDA approved ingredients</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anti-tartar</strong></li>

<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
<h3>When will my Orapup arrive if I get one through Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>We are planning to get Orapup shipped to Americans before Christmas! That means you can get them as gifts for the dog lovers in your family. Some other countriess may get them by Christmas, but we can't garauntee it.</p>
<h3>How much will Orapup cost in stores?</h3>
<p>The Orapup Starter Kit will retail for $15ish.</p>
<h3>When will Orapup be in stores?</h3>
<p>We expect to be in US stores in 2013. Other countries will come soon after. If you want one this year, you will need to back us on Indiegogo :)</p>
<h3>Is Orapup Patented?</h3>
<p>Yes. I already have one patent that applies to Orapup's bristle and scraper technology and I have others pending to protect the concept of letting dogs clean their own tongues.</p>
<h3>Do all dogs like the flavor packs? Will it work on my dog?</h3>
<p>We haven't found one dog that doesn't LOVE it. We tried literally dozens of different formulations until we found one that is universally loved. If your dog doesn't like it, please send us a note so we can work harder at the perfect formula.</p>
<h3>Does it work on dogs of all sizes?</h3>
<h3><img alt=""Works on dogs of all sizes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media.orapup.com/img/indiegogo/all_dogs_kickstarter.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>Does it really work?</h3>
<p>Yes! It really works! FYI: It won't work on dogs who have bad breath being caused by gum disease or rotting teeth, but in almost all other cases it will eliminate the worst dog breath. NOTE: it won't make your dog smell like mint, it removes the rank odor from the tongue, leaving a clean healthy mouth.</p>

You know, like having been one of a handful of people Bill Gates called on to help him launch a new idea he called Windows?  Well, this is your opportunity to take part in the launch of a New brand.  Not just any brand, but a brand that was created  specifically for the purpose of  helping to ""end the killing of millions of healthy pets"" around the world, every year. </i><br/><br/><b>CAMPAIGN MISSION </b> To wage a successful campaign to be able to divide a million dollars among animal rescues around the world and jump start ""NO-KILL 2020"" as a self-sustained income generator.  The need here is three-fold.<br/><br/> (1.)  To launch the ""NO-KILL 2020"" Brand as a full fledged profit center to generate the financial, technical and material support desperately needed by pet rescues and animal shelters.  <br/><br/>(2.)  To raise, donate and divide $1,000,000 among 4,000 rescues and shelters with each member receiving a grant for $250. <br/><br/> (3.)  To jump start a 5-1/2 year experiment to equip and enable thousands of organizations to migrate to progressive 21st Century fundraiser models designed especially for the economic realities of today.  <br/><br/><b>MATCHING FUND CREDIT  </b>If the mission is successful, NO-KILL 2020 will match the acquired sum, dollar for dollar in credit up to $250 per member to enable each one to order up to $500 of product.  That is enough goods to earn between $2,000 and $2,500 at fundraising.  The success of this campaign would mean the global pet rescues and animal shelters communities would receive a badly needed infusion of $2,000,000.  More importantly, rescues and shelters will finally able to discontinue their over-reliance on obsolete fundraisers based on having to ask for donations.   <br/><br/><b>THE ""NO-KILL 2020"" BRAND  </b>The NO-KILL 2020 Brand was created as a fundraising platform to specifically help underwrite the enormous costs associated with the rescue, physical rehabilitation and re-homing of sheltered pets.  NO-KILL 2020's evolving lines of high quality popular consumer products will be sold exclusively through pet rescues and animal shelters creating dedicated income streams for them.  The sale of NO-KILL 2020 Products will earn rescues and shelters commissions of between 10% and 40% at fundraising. <br/><br/>                                       <a href=""https://vinny-the-pugs-no-kill-2020.myshopify.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The ""NO-KILL 2020"" Brand Website</a>  <br/><br/> <b>THE ""NO-KILL 2020"" CLUB</b>  NO-KILL 2020 is setting up a Global Network of 4,000 pet rescues and animal shelters to interactively engage in coordinate research, development and fundraising.  Their short term goal is to help discover best practices and procedures necessary to achieve 100% NO-KILL sustainability to support and teach other rescuers in their regions. The long term objective is to participate in propagating the new learned strategies to help move the world toward reaching 100% NO-KILL of healthy pets by 2020.  The NK-2020 Club membership is Free and open to all qualified pet rescues and animal shelters who are invited to complete an application here:  <a href=""http://contactme.com/4f235b2ad6397f000101af57"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://contactme.com/4f235b2ad6397f000101af57</a><br/> <br/>                                         ***************************<br/><br/><b>A GLOBAL EPIDEMIC  </b>Every year from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 healthy pets are needlessly killed in the United States and Canada alone.  The failure of owners to spayed or neutered their pets contributes greatly to the excessive number of pets in shelters who are killed as a population control measure.  However, the number one cause of pets euthanized is that there is not nearly enough money to meet the escalating costs for the tens of millions of animals that enter shelters annually.  The problem is global with the number of healthy pets being killed numbering in the hundreds of millions every year.   <br/><br/><b>THE RESCUE &amp; SHELTER FUNDRAISER CONUNDRUM  </b>It is estimated that there are between 9,000 and 12,000 rescues and shelters in the United States and Canada.   They almost all conduct fundraisers where asking for donations is at the heart of their appeal for money.  The problem is that the donation seeking based fundraiser models are obsolete relics from the 19th Century when the animal welfare consciousness took root.   Over the past thirty year or so, donations have steadily declined in proportion with worsening economies and shrinking dollar. There will soon come a time when rescuers will reach the point of diminishing returns in seeking donations. That is, the point when the expense of staging a fundraiser costs more than what one can expect to pull in from the fundraiser.       <br/><br/><b>FUNDRAISING MODELS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY</b>   NO-KILL 2020 fundraisers are fully compatible with all of the economic realities of today.  They are run 24 hours a day, seven days a week to coincide with the reproductive cycle of unaltered pets.  Most importantly, they are immune from the negative effects of the economy.  Fundraisers that are created by NO-KILL 2020 are done so in ways to ensure that rescues and shelters will earn commissions as high as 40% of sales.  <br/><br/><b>MEASURES OF SUCCESS  </b>There will be several factors to measure the success of NO-KILL 2020's 5 1/2 year strategy.  First and foremost, every club member is expected to have been elevated to 100% NO-KILL status and continued to be so without ever reverting throughout the experiment.  Club members will have established themselves within their respective countries and communities as leaders in the quest to make NO-KILL of healthy animals the norm.  NK-2020's Club overall membership will have grown by 1,000 member annually as founding members engage themselves in recruiting new rescues and shelters.  Finally, success will be reflected by an ever increasing sales growth of NO-KILL 2020 Brand products resulting from rescues and shelters who migrate from seeking donations.   <br/><br/><b>IF TARGET SUM IS NOT RAISED  </b>The project will continue moving forward at a reduced rate commensurate with the amount of money raised.  Recruited club members will still receive Grants for $250 to enable them to order their first fundraiser kits.  However, the dollar for dollar matching credits will have to be shelved.  Our not reaching the target sum will be disappointing because its size is  commensurate with the scope of the challenge taken on by this campaign.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, at its completion, we will kick-off NO-KILL 2020's 5-1/2 year quest to reach 100% NO-KILL.  On March 15th of 2020, we'll perform an audit of all that has been accomplished and publish our findings as NO-KILL 2020's Best Practices and Procedures to Reach &amp; Sustain 100% NO-KILL.    <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/775034/files/20140808124644-4_Model_with_Purses_Vinny_the_Pug_Enterprises_BEST.JPG?1407527204"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><b>THANKS, HIGH 5's &amp; PERKS  </b>Of these methods of saying thanks and showing our appreciation for contributions, we believe you'd be most happy to receive a unique NO-KILL 2020 Perk that can only be gotten from us.  So, please take a moment to peruse our list of fine perks and choose the one that speaks to you.    <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/775036/files/20140808124735-Vinny_the_Pug_Seal.jpg?1407527255"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>                                       <i>THE PASSING OF ""VINNY THE PUG</i>""<br/><br/>                                               Jul 1, 2000 - Mar 15, 2013  <br/>                                         <br/><i>It was during the final weeks just before he was to strike out on Vinny the Pug's long awaited 100-City Pet Rescue and Animal Shelter Fundraiser tour of the U.S. and Canada.  We was very excited about jumping into the Jeep driving to cities to conduct fundraiser training seminars with pet rescue and animal shelters.  Then, out of the clear blue, a malignant tumor appear on his tongue and over-night, sapped Vinny the Pug of his vibrant, fearless appearance reflected io all of his pictures in the desert. <br/>The tumor quickly robbed Vinny the Pug of his strength and vitality which caused me to make that dreaded decision. On March 15th 2013 I entered<br/>the veterinarian's small examining room carrying Vinny as though he was a new born baby.  The tears streamed from my eyes but I didn't care about being seen that way.  Vinny assisted me with putting on his climbing harness one last time as he'd done hundreds of times in the Sonoran Desert.  I hugged him tightly, kissed him atop his head many times and pressed the tips of my fingers deep into his ribcage.  I did so that when he started slipping into unconsciousness, Vinny would continue feeling my presence until the final millisecond of his awareness.  The doctor pulled out two hypodermic needles filled with pharmaceuticals and inserted them, one after the other into the the hookup on Vinny's left paw which had been shaved and prepared to receive the deadly concoction.   Within a blink of an eye she'd done it, she had begun the death process.  I squeeze him even tighter and rocked Vinny back and forth while whispering in his right ear, ""I Love You Vinny, I Love You Vinny, I Love You Vinny"".  My tears flowed like rain drops but I didn't care about how I appeared, my best friend was leaving me.  As I felt his muscle begin to relax, I pressed my fingertips even harder against his ribcage until his body was perfectly still.  then, there was a very strange smell  that whipped through the air which left as quickly as it came.  I remember  thinking, ""this must be the smell of death"".  I cried even harder and louder because of an overwhelming feeling that I'd just participated in the killing of my best friend.  <br/>The doctor was very kind and understanding.  She asked if I wanted to spend more time with Vinny.  I declined and kissed him on the head one last time.  She very gently scooped up his body with a thick folded towel and slowly left the room walking backwards so that I could maintain eye contact with his body.  I stared at Vinny the Pug until the very last millisecond, when the self-closing door swung back in place.  <br/>It is now nearly 18 months since Vinny the Pug left me forever and the pain I feel  is every bit as fresh as that final moment I spent with him though not as intense.  To be perfectly truthful, I don't want to ever get over losing my best friend Vinny the Pug.  The one thing I have discovered since he left me is that, in time great  pain can turn into even greater love for a  furry friend who has crossed over.  <br/>As for me, I'm continuing the unfinished, final journey Vinny the Pug and I were preparing to strike-out on.  My destination is ""100% NO-KILL"" with an estimated time and date of arrival of 3:O' Clock PM of March 2020.<br/><br/>                                             <a href=""http://youtu.be/LiVnpCFad1Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Tribute to ""<b>VINNY THE PUG""</b></a><br/>      </i>                                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/775062/files/20140808125852-TISH.jpg?1407527932"" src="""" style=""""/><p>                                                                                                            <br/></p><p>                                                       <a href=""http://lucyinnovation.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/vinny-the-pug-champion-rock-climber/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Vinny the Pug Enterprises""</a>                                      <br/></p><p></p><p><b>ABOUT US</b>   I was the trainer, photographer,

<h2><strong>WHY YOU NEED THIS</strong></h2>
<p>Who wouldn't prefer a nice hot, home-made, meal for lunch?</p>
<p>What you eat largely determines how your body grows, develops and performs every day.  Diet is one of the most frequently looked to factors when assessing performance issues like Attention Deficit, Fatigue, and Hyperactivity, and common aches and pains.  Bringing a hot lunch from home allows you to control your diet and benefit in many, many ways.</p>
<p>Save money. Over the course of a career you could save $100,000 by bringing a sack lunch every day.</p>
<p>Feel great.  Hot foods are healthier.  They are more nutrient dense, and more easily digested.  Turns out mom was right - have a nice hot lunch and you'll feel better.</p>
<p>Lose weight.  Hot foods trigger the satiety response, so you feel fuller, sooner. </p>
<p>Enjoy lunchtime.  Hot foods have more flavinoids - so they taste better too.</p>
<p>Get ready to say goodbye to cold sandwiches forever.  Wouldn't you rather have some of last nights' lasagna, a burger, or a gooey grilled cheese sandwich? Wouldn't it be great if you could just heat it up quickly in the morning and<em> just have it </em><strong><em>Stay Hot</em></strong>?  Well, now you can!</p>

<p>Our prototypes have gone through multiple design cycles and we believe we've finally perfected the secret sauce.  The tote is comprised of two compartments.  The lower compartment is designed to preserve heat for several hours.  It accomplishes this through a combination of special insulation,  and our proprietary Heat Banks.  It is made of a neoprene-like material designed to keep heat in, and be cool to the touch.  The upper compartment is designed to allow the user to pack cold items such as a drink or fruit.  The temperatures from the two compartments will not mix or interfere with one another.  So go ahead and bring that hot, juicy burger and an ice cold drink!</p>

<h2><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Heat management:</strong> Using the same technology that NASA uses in space suits, our proprietary blend will literally control the temperature of your food. </li>
<li>
<strong>Insulation:</strong>  preHEAT uses a proprietary blend of insulation that literally traps the heat in the lower compartment and prevents it from seeping into the environment or into upper compartment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lightweight:</strong>  preHEAT is light enough for even a small child to carry.</li>
<li>
<strong>Easy to use:</strong>  Simple design includes an expandable upper compartment and removable pouches.  Both compartments zip closed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reusable &amp; Sustainable:</strong>  preHEAT can be reused thousands of times.  preHEAT can be wiped clean, so you don't need any harsh cleaning chemicals.</li>
<li>
<strong>Safe</strong>:  preHEAT uses organic, non-toxic, food-grade materials.  We don't use toxic chemical coatings.  All materials are phalate and BPA-free.</li>

<h2><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></h2>
<p>This amazing feat of thermodynamics happens thanks to a special non-toxic, organic material that is housed and sewn into the removable pouches. This is what we call the Heat-Bank. This material is designed to melt above 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and absorb a lot of energy as it does. While it's absorbing all of this energy it becomes soft. This is how you know your Heat-Bank is full. Once the interior of the compartment begins to fall below this temperature, this special material begins to harden again - releasing the energy it stored when it melted. Thanks to a specially designed insulation layer the heat that is released into the interior of the bag is trapped there. This is how preHEAT keeps your lunch hot for so long. The difference is noticeable and can change the way you think about lunch.</p>
<p>preHEAT is designed to be super easy to use. Simply place the removable Heat Bank pouches in your microwave oven. Microwave times required to fill the Heat-Bank will vary depending on the strength of your microwave, so instructions will be provided with your purchase. For most microwaves, 3 minutes does the trick.  Replace the pouches in your preHEAT lunch tote.  The Heat-Bank is full. It will begin to release its stored heat into the preHEAT at just the right time, keeping your meal hotter, longer. Next, heat your food as you normally would.  Transfer it to a travel-safe container, place the filled container in your preHEAT.  Add a cold drink, a snack, and some fruit to the upper compartment.  Close it up and you're done. That's it!</p>
<p><strong>With your help we can release these totes and let you experience the next level in food transportation.</strong></p>

<h2><strong> preHEAT vs. thermos</strong></h2>
<p>Thermoses are limited by the size of the opening and the cylindrical shape.  They can only contain small foods that can be compressed inside.  They are also heavy, bulky, difficult to carry and manipulate.  preHEAT has no such limits!

<h2><strong>What can I do with my preHEAT?</strong></h2>
<p>preHEAT can be used for any occasion where you may want to bring a warm meal.  Bring it to sporting events, picnics, the beach, camping, traveling, commuting, long car rides to grandma's house - anywhere you might want a hot meal.</p>

<h2><strong>I am not sure about it.  Why do I need a thermal regulating lunch tote?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."" - Henry Ford</strong></h3>
<p>Technology has taken us forward by leaps and bounds.  It saves us time, money, and provides new and unique services.  We need to adopt them to give ourselves more time for other, and better, things in life.  If you're still confused about whether or not you need preHEAT then ask yourself this: Do you have time to prepare a fresh meal for <strong>each and every meal</strong>? Do you worry about what allergens or toxins might be present in yours or your child's food?  Are you still spending tens, hundreds, or even thousands of dollars every year eating out in restaurants or on school lunches when you could pack your own, better meal, for far less?</p>

<h2><strong>Who made preHEAT?</strong></h2>
<h3>THE BACK STORY</h3>
<p>When my oldest son was three he stopped growing! He couldn't look me in the eye, answer a direct question, or concentrate for any length of time. He made strange noises, covered his ears, and played in the dirt while the other kids his age were building with blocks and learning to write their names. We were told he might be Autistic and should seek the advice of a developmental pediatrician. After medical evaluation and testing, we found out that his problems were the result of food allergies and food intolerance. We quickly changed the diet for the whole family. <br/><br/> The result? Within one week my son's hyperactivity abated. Within six months he grew several inches. Over time his noises and other ""quirks"" disappeared. I'm happy to say that he is now an incredibly smart, funny, healthy, and very typical ten year old.</p>
<p>While the benefits of a more natural, healthier diet were very visible and obvious, a method for maintaining it wasn't. This new diet presented me with quite a challenge. Eating out? Forget about it. Almost every store or restaurant bought meal contains some allergen or other no-no food. Parties and treats provided by schools or daycare? Nope. These are usually made with gluten, dairy, and other allergens. Not to mention packed with preservatives, chemicals and dyes. School lunches? Not a chance. Highly processed mystery meat was definitely out. I ended up cooking all natural, whole foods at home, packing them in some sort of container and carrying it with us everywhere we went. But how to keep it from spoiling? Cooked foods need to be kept hot to prevent the growth of bacteria.<br/><br/> And so, preHEAT was born.</p>

<h2><strong>Where we are</strong></h2>
<p>The materials are ready.  Through over a dozen iterations/prototypes, we've found our secret sauce - and it's ready for production.</p>
<p>Further, we've mastered the manufacturing.  The pieces are all in place to make preHEAT a reality.</p>
<p>We're down to the final barrier.  We need your help to bring preHEAT to life. </p>
<p>This campaign is for one Navy preHEAT.  As a stretch goal, if the preHEAT project takes off, we will grow our offering by adding additional colors and prints and even additional sizes.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>So where does the funding go?</strong></h2>
<p>preHEAT is a multi-purpose design.  It requires the material for the Heat Bank, textiles, special insulation, and of course, the final construction.  We've put a lot of work to bring preHEAT to life; however, getting something robust enough to endure the elements, simple enough to use, light enough to carry, safe enough for children, and finally cheap enough so everyone can afford one, we have to professionally manufacture both the materials and the totes; which is an expensive proposition.  The funding we raise with your help will be used for purchasing the materials to build the Heat Bank, as well as, covering the production of the proprietary raw materials, along with fixed and variable costs of making the totes.  We know you will love to have the newest Hot lunch tote.</p>

Who wouldn't prefer a nice hot, home-made, meal for lunch?
What you eat largely determines how your body grows, develops and performs every day.  Diet is one of the most frequently looked to factors when assessing performance issues like Attention Deficit, Fatigue, and Hyperactivity, and common aches and pains.  Bringing a hot lunch from home allows you to control your diet and benefit in many, many ways.
Save money. Over the course of a career you could save $100,000 by bringing a sack lunch every day.
Feel great.  Hot foods are healthier.  They are more nutrient dense, and more easily digested.  Turns out mom was right - have a nice hot lunch and you'll feel better.
Lose weight.  Hot foods trigger the satiety response, so you feel fuller, sooner. 
Enjoy lunchtime.  Hot foods have more flavinoids - so they taste better too.
Get ready to say goodbye to cold sandwiches forever.  Wouldn't you rather have some of last nights' lasagna, a burger, or a gooey grilled cheese sandwich? Wouldn't it be great if you could just heat it up quickly in the morning and just have it Stay Hot?  Well, now you can!

<h4>The Playing Field</h4>
<p>Everyone loves sports, and everyone has their favorite teams they're passionate about supporting. Sales of licensed sports merchandise exceeded over 16 billion dollars in 2013, and continues to grow!</p>
<p>Subscription boxes are the hottest trend on the market today, featuring everything from beauty products to socks to adult novelties, and have grown into a 4 billion dollar industry with hundreds of thousands of subscribers in just a few short years with no signs of slowing down!</p>
<p>Yet, there are no subscription boxes for professional or collegiate sports fans.</p>
<p>GearBoxx fills this void with GameDay GearBoxx and Collegiate GearBoxx, allowing subscribers to pick their favorite teams and receive officially licensed gear... Every month!</p>
<p></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Any Team... Any Where... No Malls</h4>
<p>One frustration experienced by sports fans around the country (and the world) is the lack of products in their area for out-of-town teams. Ever tried to find Eagles merchandise in Dallas? Or Arizona merchandise in Maine? Even fans of local teams still have to brave the hazards of mall shopping to get to the gear they want for the teams they love.</p>
<p>With GearBoxx, subscribers can pick their teams and receive officially licensed merchandise every month without the  frustration of navigating the mall parking lot or fighting the crowd only to find nothing for their favorite team.</p>
<p>Plus, the GearBoxx site will also host our easy to navigate GearShop where subscribers can find even more gear, often at discount prices!</p>
<p></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Fan Guy or Fan Gal, We've Got Your Gear</h4>
<p>Face it, guys... The ladies can be every bit as much of a sports nut as you are! When you become a subscriber and complete your profile, you'll let us know if you're a Fan Guy or a Fan Gal. When we send out GearBoxxes with gender-specific items we'll know who to send them to!</p>

</div></div>","PROBLEMTraditional sneakers have almost zero cushioning.SOLUTIONInspired by cushioned marathon maximalist running shoes, MARATOWN developed a thick super cushioned sole made of very soft and bouncy materials. A new way to offer maximal comfort. BOUNCELLS™ is the material used in the sole. It is a high dense closed cell copolymer EVA, exclusively developped for Maratown™. Similar to the cutting edge running shoe technology, Bouncells™ is:-Super soft: around 20 ShA-Elastic: rebound is as important as shock absorption. Without rebound after a step, it would feel like walking in the sand - exhausting. Rebound return energy to the step makes the walk more dynamic. -Resilient: it doesn't flatten before millions of steps.-Lightweight: similar is used in running shoes where weight is essential.MARATOWN put 33% less pressure on your feet at the pic impact with the ground (measured with pressure sensors insole), thanks to our highly-cushioned soles. Feel your feet can't handle any more pressure in your painful shoes? You are at the right place. PODIATRISTSB.Gaignot, podiatrist Paris, France : ""Maratown offers a real, innovating, shock absorbing sole with modern style. Maratown also meets standards of comfortable shoes: wide room, lightweight, seamless inside, padded collar and tongue, and removable insoles for you to insert your personalized orthotic insoles. As a podiatrist, I would also say Maratown fits with most orthoses, especially for the diabetic foot""

DISCOVER THE UNTOLD STORY


After the amazing success of the first Kickstarter campaign when I manage to raise more than 500% of the initial goal.
I teamed up with a Swiss Manufacturing Company with over 30 years in the watchmaking industry to produce the ultimate perennial watch developed and individually assembled In-House in the watch capital of the world Biel/Bienne, Switzerland. ''There is something about Peren watches that I like, the idea of direct purchases from the company right to your wrists, simply fantastic'' wristreview.comWe bring to the next level the trendiest ‘’Direct to you’’ feature of the most Kickstarter watches.IN HOUSE DESIGN AND ASSEMBLINGAt Peren Watches we exercise control over all the aspects of the manufacturing process. This particular approach confers us the possibility of producing unique products unmatched quality-wise at the selected price level.The design of the watch has its inspiration from the Transylvanian tradition and mythology combined with the distinctive legacy of elaborate craftsmanship preserved throughout generations. After spending more than one year in the designing process under the guidance of Red Dott award winning Swiss designers. We managed to integrate a revolutionary moon-phase indicator at 6H inspired by the astronomical phenomenon of Blood Moon. The SOD Logo is inspired by the same representation of a Dragon at the house where Vlad Dracula was born in the city of Sighisoara, Transylvania.The special elements that define the Transylvanian design of the watch are the two hemicycles at 12H and 6H with holes for both the Date window as well as the Moon-phase indicator. This particularity has its inspiration from the medieval Transylvanian castles. Another key aspect of the design is the double layered dial with red indexes on the first layer and fangs shaped excisions on the upper layer. The center of the dial is built to emphasize the bat shape of the embossed inner dial carved with wooden horizontal lines pattern and inspired by the Transylvanian mythology. Because we pay the utmost attention to the details, we choose to print our dials at the same Swiss Company as renowned brands such as Omega, Zenith, and Tudor.The Swiss Made ISA 8171 Movement with its patented double rotor motor and central chronograph trotteuse with five steps per second, it operates similar to an automatic or mechanical movement, giving a smooth motion to the unique chronograph central hand with the counterweight logo harmoniously aligned with the Peren, Transylvania inscription.WITNESS THE WATCH IN ACTION If a certain level of the funding process will be overpassed every perennial timepiece will be individually engraved with the production number on the side of the case.Emphasizing a distinctive quality expertise within the watches, it is achieved by using only premium quality raw materials and only after conducting a various number of tests throughout the complete manufacturing and assembling process.

<p>We have selected only the most reliable parts, which can be easily mass produced. To make sure we deliver on time we have already started the negotiation process with factories in China and Taiwan. The device is a product of a rigorous development process: we are offering you the second version of the device, which has been vastly improved. For example, the ring size was decreased by 20% from the original version.</p>

<p>The Nimb team eventually met Kathy, who experienced a life threatening attack of her own.</p>
<p>In 2000, Kathy was violently attacked by a complete stranger and was on the brink of death. She suffered multiple stab wounds and lacerations in a safe neighborhood, just a few feet from the police station. Her saving grace wasn’t just her fight and drive to survive, but the call for help. Since then, she has been searching to find a way for others to have a voice when they’re in need of help.</p>

<p>When Kathy met the Nimb team, she was eager to join in. Not only is Kathy now our Communications Director, she has since then become an activist and one of the driving forces behind this project. Thus, the team empowered by personal experiences brought Nimb to life. To us, the journey to achieve personal security is just that, personal. With Nimb, everyone can feel safe in almost any situation. </p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h1>
<div> </div>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>What are the materials of the ring?</b></p>
<p>Nimb is made of high quality glossy metal and matt plastic. All the materials are hypoallergenic.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Is Nimb waterproof?</b></p>
<p>Currently, the ring is protected against dust and splashes of water. We are working to make it water and dust resistant according to the IP67 class of protection.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Is there any warranty?</b></p>
<p>We offer a one-year warranty for the ring. The warranty and replacement policy will be finalized after we choose out production facility.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Who can be included in the pre-set list of alert receivers?</b></p>
<p>Nimb users decide whom to alert in case of emergency. She or he manages the list of alert receivers in the application. The list can include relatives and friends, local authorities, law enforcement agencies, private security organizations and other receivers from different safety circles. The user can pre-set an option when the alert is available for passers by and/or members of communities who have our application installed and volunteered to provide help.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How does the ring alert the police?</b></p>
<p>Nimb user chooses whom to alert and sets the list of receivers. In the app settings she or he can activate the option to alert your emergency contacts. When you press the button on either the ring or the app, our system creates a robotic call option — the call goes to the nearest emergency dispatch center (the system makes a decision based on your GPS coordinates) and contains all crucial information about you: your name, gender and location. This message explains to the operator, that the call is automatic because you are in an emergency and you could't make a personal call.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What if I press the button accidentally?</b></p>
<p>It's nearly impossible to press the button by accident, because (1) we concealed it in the ring design and (2) you would have to keep pressing the button for three seconds to start the alert process. The ring starts vibrating immediately once you press the button, so you will definitely notice it and be able to stop pressing the button if sending an alert signal wasn’t your intention. Also, the system provides an additional 20 seconds to cancel the alert in the application if you press the button by mistake.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Is there a subscription fee?</b></p>
<p>Our alert system is very flexible. You can use our application for free to send and receive Nimb alerts. You can purchase the ring and use it without any subscription fee. Only if you choose to alert private security services, you may have to pay a subscription fee depending on such service and your location.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Will Nimb work if my phone is dead?</b></p>
<p>You need your smartphone operational with Bluetooth® on to send alerts from the ring. That said, we’re going to introduce the next generation of rings in about a year. The next generation will perform independently. We are working very hard to make sure that the new technology is stable before implementing it in such an important wearable device as a safety ring.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Can I pair the ring to two smartphones?</b></p>
<p>You can pair the ring only to one smartphone. Should you choose to, you can reconnect your ring to a different smartphone.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What kind of notifications does the system send?</b></p>
<p>It can be push notification in the app, text message, a call, an email or a vibration signal to the ring or a combination thereof.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Do alert recipients also need a ring to receive alerts or do they only need to download the app?</b></p>
<p>You do not need the ring on the receiving end. Your emergency contacts will get a push message in the app if they have downloaded the app and also receive an SMS with a link to our website, where they can get info similar to the one in the app: your location, your information card, chat to communicate with others who have responded, etc. However, if they do have a Nimb ring, the ring will vibrate when there is an emergency message coming in. Even if their phone is in a purse, or is otherwise not easily accessible, they won't miss your call for help.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How I can be sure it doesn’t track my location all the time?</b></p>
<p>Your privacy is our highest priority. We respect your right to privacy and treat your personal information with strict confidentiality. You profile information and location become available to your safety circles only after you send out an alert. You only activate the tracking feature by pressing the button for three seconds.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Will you ship internationally?</b></p>
<p>Nimb works everywhere in the world, as long as the ring is paired with a compatible smartphone that has an active cellular and data connection. We will be happy to ship Nimb to your location anywhere around the world.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is crowdsource security?</b></p>
<p>Crowdsource security is a system where individuals are connected via Nimb devices and the app to provide help to those in trouble and in need of help. While we have a lot of faith in official law enforcement agencies we can add value to such services — by empowering communities to protect themselves.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Do I have to wear Nimb on a certain finger?</b></p>
<p>We have a wide range of sizes for your convenience — you can wear Nimb on any finger of your right or left hand.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How long does the battery last?</b></p>
<p>Nimb is functional for up to two weeks without recharging. The charger is included with your purchase of the device.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Why did you decide to make a device as a ring?</b></p>
<p>Only with the ring you can send an alert quickly and quietly, even if both of your hands’ movements are immobilized or restricted.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Would an attacker take the ring off if he or she knows of the ring?</b></p>
<p>To begin with, we view the wide exposure and adoption of our product as an advantage, because attackers tend to avoid those who protect themselves. We have all seen those signs ""Protected by such and such"" or even ""Beware of dog"". Moreover, it would be quite challenging to have your Nimb ring removed in under three seconds, the time you need to keep pressing the button and sending out an alert.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is the maximum operating distance between a smartphone and Nimb?</b></p>
<p>We use Class 2 Bluetooth® module with a range of up to 100 feet/30 meters. The range of 100 feet/30 meters is the best achievable range under perfect conditions. In real life situations, the device usually provides a range of 15 to 30 feet/5 to 10 meters, and we prefer to provide you with actual factsand not create unrealistic expectations so that you can act accordingly. Since we are talking about emergencies where every second counts we recommend keeping your phone within 15 feet/5 meters from the ring, where the connection works well in most situations. You should also know that the range depends not only on the transmitterand the mobile phone which is receiving data, but also depends on weather, geographic and local conditions. <br/>We are constantly working to improve Nimb's features and functionality. We plan to have the next version of the ring to be completely independent from smartphones. Until then, we are confident in the ring’s stable performance within the specified range and hope to provide our backers with the best available technical solution.</p>

</div></div>","Nimb is a ring with a panic button that allows you to send an emergency alert to preset contacts from the mobile app with just the touch of a thumb.

 

 
Emergencies can be scary, but Nimb provides vibration feedback to let you know that a message has gone out and help is on the way. Whether you’re in trouble, experiencing a health issue or being attacked, Nimb is there to call for help when you need it most.
 

 
 

 


 

 
 

  When in trouble, press the button and hold it for three seconds — the message with your profile info and your location reaches your safety circles. Sending an alert message takes only three seconds. After that you can call 911 or other emergency service, if the situation allows you to do so. 


 
Nimb will track your location in real-time and the response team will always know exactly where you are. Stay connected to your loved ones with Nimb, when using other devices for communication is not possible. 
 

 

 
 

  When you use the Nimb mobile app, you’re free to choose and set up your safety circles however you like. You can set it up to alert only the emergency services, just your best friend, your entire family or people nearby — the power is in your hands.


 


 

 
 

  We believe that society is ready to provide its members with peer-to-peer help even in extreme situations. Communities have a role to play in bringing better practices to different areas of life. Personal security shouldn’t be an exception.

You can join communities to help and empower people with similar values and views. If you belong to an organization, a movement or a team, now you are able to support your fellow associates, should they happen to be in urgent need.
 

 
We see Nimb as a movement towards safer environments, where people combine efforts to help someone in trouble, whether they are authorized officials, close ones, sympathetic neighbors or just passersby.
The key to a safer world is in your hands, literally.
 

 
 

  Nimb helps to create a safer environment for yourself and those around you, from caregivers to health scares.

It can wash your parental anxiety away — you will always know if your kids need help. Your senior relatives can rely on Nimb if they have troubles using a cell phone or other devices.

 
Have a younger daughter or a sibling in college? You can both wear Nimb and know that you’ll never miss an alert from them. Whether you’re at the movies, napping or out for dinner, as long as you both wear Nimb rings and an alert goes out, your Nimb will vibrate to let you know that she or he needs help.

 
Doing extreme sports or like traveling? Nimb will become your most trusted companion. It works everywhere in the world where cellular networks function. Nimb will help you to explore new places or limits while feeling safe and secure.

 
If you have entrepreneurial ambitions and are running your own business, Nimb can protect your employees and valuable equipment.

 
If your health condition creates some limits for using traditional communication means, Nimb can provide you with an easy and reliable way to call for help.

 
We understand that the older you are, the more attention you might need. Many senior citizens feel uncomfortable about wearing panic buttons on their necks, as these devices draw unwelcome attention and make them feel old. Nimb is a stylish ring that is not only more convenient than the neck piece but also elegant. 

 

 
 

  Nimb is very efficient in emergencies, but it’s cool, too. We played with colors and forms to come with a simple and polished design that you would totally like, whatever style you prefer: city chic, smart casual, luxury glam or health-gothic. 


 
Nimb is beautiful and comfortable on your finger. The future shines on its metal moldings, and matt surface — Stealth Black and Classic White — complements your sense of taste. The ring is available in US ring sizes 4-12, you can wear it on any of your fingers!
 

 
 

  Reliable performance of a safety ring is an absolute must — we took it very seriously and conducted hundreds of tests. We made sure that Nimb’s ergonomics is optimal and sending the signal is easy. Then we worked thoroughly to prevent accidental alerts, bringing this possibility to a feasible minimum. We tested the stability of Bluetooth signal, application responses, applied pressure of different force and duration to the button. It copes with shower rain and routine work around the house. We’ve taken the ring through almost every relevant testing to help our product live up to the promise. 


 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 Give the ring to your loved ones and wear one yourself, and you’ll always know when they need your help: your ring will vibrate if they press their panic button. 


 
 

 If you cannot reach your loved one, you can send a vibration signal to her or his ring to attract their attention.


 

  With Nimb you are less likely to forget your phone in a taxi or a restaurant. The ring will vibrate as soon as the distance between the phone and the ring exceeds preset limit.


 

 Not only does Nimb give you the chance to alert friends & family when you find yourself in an uncertain or threatening situation, it also offers an audio recording function that automatically collects evidence from your smartphone once the panic button has been pressed.


 

 Your privacy means as much to us as it does to you. We want you to know that Nimb is not a tracking device. Your location and information will only be shared after you press the panic button. We make sure to keep your info private and secure. In case of an emergency, we have the ability to provide your info to response teams, but only to save your life. 


 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 

  We have been working tirelessly to improve the design for well over a year now. Not only is the design of the ring important to us, but we also gave a lot of thought to how Nimb can fit into your daily life. We want Nimb to be there for you when you need it most.

Eight incredibly intelligent engineers that comprise our technical team have an average of 10 years worth of experience in developing both consumer and non-consumer wearables. This team has previously developed products for Epson and LG. Our technical team also has extensive experience working with Chinese manufacturing companies.

 
We have selected only the most reliable parts, which can be easily mass produced. To make sure we deliver on time we have already started the negotiation process with factories in China and Taiwan. The device is a product of a rigorous development process: we are offering you the second version of the device, which has been vastly improved. For example, the ring size was decreased by 20% from the original version.

 
We care about reliability and usability. We are confident in the components we have selected. The button is located in such a way that it is intuitively easy to press in emergency situations. All the materials we used are hypoallergenic.

 
The engineering design is simple and very reliable. The battery provides a long work cycle. The vibration motor and light source provide feedback and allow not only to send but also to receive signals.
Our intellectual property is protected by eight utility and design patents, some of them currently pending.  
 

 
 

  Our team has worked vigorously through more than 100 different designs of Nimb and asked more than 2,000 women to choose which they love the most. 

As of today, we have developed our second version of Nimb prototype and are currently working with several factories, getting ready to start mass production. This very design that you see in photos throughout the campaign page are, in fact, working prototypes, so the ring you receive will look just like it does in the photos!

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 Everything started when our founder Leo found out that his female friend had been attacked while walking down the street. She had her phone and a can of pepper spray in her purse, but no time to reach in and grab either one of them. The outcome is what you see now. We decided that this horrific experience would become more than a staggering statistic.


 
The Nimb team eventually met Kathy, who experienced a life threatening attack of her own.
In 2000, Kathy was violently attacked by a complete stranger and was on the brink of death. She suffered multiple stab wounds and lacerations in a safe neighborhood, just a few feet from the police station. Her saving grace wasn’t just her fight and drive to survive, but the call for help. Since then, she has been searching to find a way for others to have a voice when they’re in need of help.

 
When Kathy met the Nimb team, she was eager to join in. Not only is Kathy now our Communications Director, she has since then become an activist and one of the driving forces behind this project. Thus, the team empowered by personal experiences brought Nimb to life. To us, the journey to achieve personal security is just that, personal. With Nimb, everyone can feel safe in almost any situation. 

 
Nimb Inc. is a team of bright-eyed enthusiasts who have united to launch this campaign. Our team spans multiple disciplines including hardware, software, finance, marketing, communications and product design.

FAQ
 
 


What are the materials of the ring?
Nimb is made of high quality glossy metal and matt plastic. All the materials are hypoallergenic.
 


Is Nimb waterproof?
Currently, the ring is protected against dust and splashes of water. We are working to make it water and dust resistant according to the IP67 class of protection.
 


Is there any warranty?
We offer a one-year warranty for the ring. The warranty and replacement policy will be finalized after we choose out production facility.
 


Who can be included in the pre-set list of alert receivers?
Nimb users decide whom to alert in case of emergency. She or he manages the list of alert receivers in the application. The list can include relatives and friends, local authorities, law enforcement agencies, private security organizations and other receivers from different safety circles. The user can pre-set an option when the alert is available for passers by and/or members of communities who have our application installed and volunteered to provide help.
 


How does the ring alert the police?
Nimb user chooses whom to alert and sets the list of receivers. In the app settings she or he can activate the option to alert your emergency contacts. When you press the button on either the ring or the app, our system creates a robotic call option — the call goes to the nearest emergency dispatch center (the system makes a decision based on your GPS coordinates) and contains all crucial information about you: your name, gender and location. This message explains to the operator, that the call is automatic because you are in an emergency and you could't make a personal call.
 


What if I press the button accidentally?
It's nearly impossible to press the button by accident, because (1) we concealed it in the ring design and (2) you would have to keep pressing the button for three seconds to start the alert process. The ring starts vibrating immediately once you press the button, so you will definitely notice it and be able to stop pressing the button if sending an alert signal wasn’t your intention. Also, the system provides an additional 20 seconds to cancel the alert in the application if you press the button by mistake.

Only if you choose to alert private security services, you may have to pay a subscription fee depending on such service and your location.

The next generation will perform independently. We are working very hard to make sure that the new technology is stable before implementing it in such an important wearable device as a safety ring.
 


Can I pair the ring to two smartphones?
You can pair the ring only to one smartphone. Should you choose to, you can reconnect your ring to a different smartphone.
 


What kind of notifications does the system send?
It can be push notification in the app, text message, a call, an email or a vibration signal to the ring or a combination thereof.
 


Do alert recipients also need a ring to receive alerts or do they only need to download the app?
You do not need the ring on the receiving end. Your emergency contacts will get a push message in the app if they have downloaded the app and also receive an SMS with a link to our website, where they can get info similar to the one in the app: your location, your information card, chat to communicate with others who have responded, etc. However, if they do have a Nimb ring, the ring will vibrate when there is an emergency message coming in.

What is crowdsource security?
Crowdsource security is a system where individuals are connected via Nimb devices and the app to provide help to those in trouble and in need of help. While we have a lot of faith in official law enforcement agencies we can add value to such services — by empowering communities to protect themselves.

How long does the battery last?
Nimb is functional for up to two weeks without recharging. The charger is included with your purchase of the device.
 


Why did you decide to make a device as a ring?
Only with the ring you can send an alert quickly and quietly, even if both of your hands’ movements are immobilized or restricted.
 


Would an attacker take the ring off if he or she knows of the ring?
To begin with, we view the wide exposure and adoption of our product as an advantage, because attackers tend to avoid those who protect themselves. We have all seen those signs ""Protected by such and such"" or even ""Beware of dog"". Moreover, it would be quite challenging to have your Nimb ring removed in under three seconds, the time you need to keep pressing the button and sending out an alert.
 


What is the maximum operating distance between a smartphone and Nimb?
We use Class 2 Bluetooth® module with a range of up to 100 feet/30 meters. The range of 100 feet/30 meters is the best achievable range under perfect conditions.

</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p><p>I truly have been fortunate
to pursue my passions of performance arts and entertainment. As a teenager I
trained with Dance Theatre of Harlem and Alvin Ailey. As a college student, I
majored in Ballet and minored in Business Management at the prestigious Marymount Manhattan
College in New York City. Finally as a young adult, I gained professional
experience as a model, commercial actress, and Knicks City Dancer.  Ten years of experience in the entertainment
industry has afforded me an acute understanding of the needs and demands that performers face throughout their careers. Interestingly, one reoccurring
challenge was the need for proper undergarments. Two qualities that entertainers look for when purchasing products are transparency and skin
color match. Of the two, certain brands offer transparency, while color
matching remains in high demand. </p>
<p>In all stages of my dance
career, I have experienced the hardships of not finding hosiery that matched my
skin tone. We were required to wear nude undergarments as part of our uniform
and therefore spent hours dying/spray painting tights and shoes as most hosiery
brands did not produce the appropriate shade of nude. This too was a common
complaint of the wardrobe departments of many castings and productions that I
have been a part of. Sadly, the dying method was a luxury not often afforded
to projects due to budget constraints and the laborious process. As a result,
many women, of all races, were left feeling uncomfortable and unprepared to
perform. This was the origin of Nude Barre in 2009. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/470038/files/20140329193244-nude-barre.jpg?1396146764"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Nude Barre offers 16
different shades of color matching undergarments by utilizing the foundation
makeup colors. Nude Barre has addressed both customer concerns
of transparency and color matching. Though the genesis of Nude Barre came from
the entertainment world, I quickly learned during the seed and start-up stages
of the company that my product was in high demand by all women and had applications
not only for the stage, but also for everyday wear by business women,
teachers, mothers, entrepreneurs, socialites, etc.</span></p>
<p>Currently in its 5<sup>th</sup> year of operations, Nude Barre has a strong customer base that enjoys a high
quality product at a very affordable price. 
As we enter the growth phase of our business, I am extremely excited for
the of increased sales and customers, new employees, and other
infrastructural upgrades. Your support through Indigogo will be a critical
component to the continued success of Nude Barre.</p>
<p><br/></p><p></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Campaign:</b></p><p></p><p>Nude Barre is a specialty line of eco friendly undergarments made in 16 shades of nude to match all women's skin tones. I'm asking for your help in raising $50,000 to grow Nude Barre. Over the past few years, Nude Barre has enjoyed some great success. Celebrities such as Wendy Williams, Mya, and Melissa Gorga have fallen in love with Nude Barre fishnets. Various dance schools, professional dance companies, and productions have also become Nude Barre customers.</p><p>Additionally, Last spring I was accepted into the Workshop at Macy's Inc. program which selected 20 minority/women owned businesses that have potential to sell in Macy's stores nationwide. The workshop taught participants how to sell to department stores like Macy's and I was given an opportunity to pitch Nude Barre to the buyers.</p>
<p>But now I need your help to
take Nude Barre to the next level. We are in need of hiring more employees for
the day to day operations. Given inventory and sales growth, Nude Barre needs
to move from my home office to a commercial office space and showroom. I also
need to become EDI compliant so that we can do business with major department
stores such as Macy's. Furthermore, we have redesigned the Nude Barre packaging (as requested by some of our buyers) and your donation will help us manufacture the new design.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/471016/files/20140330104129-NudeBarre.jpg?1396201289"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Nude Barre plans to grow into a full undergarments brand that makes all things underwear in 16 shades of nude. I am so excited to have completed the samples for the Nude Barre panties.

<p></p></div>","Nude Barre's Beginning

I truly have been fortunate
to pursue my passions of performance arts and entertainment. As a teenager I
trained with Dance Theatre of Harlem and Alvin Ailey. As a college student, I
majored in Ballet and minored in Business Management at the prestigious Marymount Manhattan
College in New York City. Finally as a young adult, I gained professional
experience as a model, commercial actress, and Knicks City Dancer.  Ten years of experience in the entertainment
industry has afforded me an acute understanding of the needs and demands that performers face throughout their careers. Interestingly, one reoccurring
challenge was the need for proper undergarments. Two qualities that entertainers look for when purchasing products are transparency and skin
color match. Of the two, certain brands offer transparency, while color
matching remains in high demand. 
In all stages of my dance
career, I have experienced the hardships of not finding hosiery that matched my
skin tone. We were required to wear nude undergarments as part of our uniform
and therefore spent hours dying/spray painting tights and shoes as most hosiery
brands did not produce the appropriate shade of nude. This too was a common
complaint of the wardrobe departments of many castings and productions that I
have been a part of. Sadly, the dying method was a luxury not often afforded
to projects due to budget constraints and the laborious process. As a result,
many women, of all races, were left feeling uncomfortable and unprepared to
perform. This was the origin of Nude Barre in 2009. Nude Barre offers 16
different shades of color matching undergarments by utilizing the foundation
makeup colors. Nude Barre has addressed both customer concerns
of transparency and color matching. Though the genesis of Nude Barre came from
the entertainment world, I quickly learned during the seed and start-up stages
of the company that my product was in high demand by all women and had applications
not only for the stage, but also for everyday wear by business women,
teachers, mothers, entrepreneurs, socialites, etc.
Currently in its 5th year of operations, Nude Barre has a strong customer base that enjoys a high
quality product at a very affordable price. 
As we enter the growth phase of our business, I am extremely excited for
the of increased sales and customers, new employees, and other
infrastructural upgrades. Your support through Indigogo will be a critical
component to the continued success of Nude Barre.
The Campaign:Nude Barre is a specialty line of eco friendly undergarments made in 16 shades of nude to match all women's skin tones. I'm asking for your help in raising $50,000 to grow Nude Barre. Over the past few years, Nude Barre has enjoyed some great success. Celebrities such as Wendy Williams, Mya, and Melissa Gorga have fallen in love with Nude Barre fishnets. Various dance schools, professional dance companies, and productions have also become Nude Barre customers.Additionally, Last spring I was accepted into the Workshop at Macy's Inc. program which selected 20 minority/women owned businesses that have potential to sell in Macy's stores nationwide. The workshop taught participants how to sell to department stores like Macy's and I was given an opportunity to pitch Nude Barre to the buyers.
But now I need your help to
take Nude Barre to the next level. We are in need of hiring more employees for
the day to day operations. Given inventory and sales growth, Nude Barre needs
to move from my home office to a commercial office space and showroom. I also
need to become EDI compliant so that we can do business with major department
stores such as Macy's. Furthermore, we have redesigned the Nude Barre packaging (as requested by some of our buyers) and your donation will help us manufacture the new design.Nude Barre plans to grow into a full undergarments brand that makes all things underwear in 16 shades of nude. I am so excited to have completed the samples for the Nude Barre panties. This campaign will help provide the capital needed to launch the underwear line this summer.  Nude Barre has a proven model and track record of success. With your support, we will be able to provide more women with a much needed solution to their undergarment challenges. Nude Barre is reinventing underwear. It's where great fashion meets solution.

Be sure that we have designed and developed the REVELIA following all rules and personal recommendations from the IRB.</p><p><br/><strong>If Révèle does not reach its goal, what happens to my order ?</strong><br/>If we do not make our goal, the campaign will not be validated. You will be reimbursed and will not receive your product or orders.</p><p><br/><strong>When will the Breast Health medical study be officially published ?</strong><br/>Research studies of this caliber take time in order to complete and to be validated! It will be published by the end of 2017. We will definitely let you know when it is out !</p><p><strong>What is the refund policy?</strong><br/>Due to the nature of Indiegogo as a crowdfunding platform, we cannot offer refunds to backers once the campaign  ends. Once the campaign ends, your ""perks"" are immediately turned into a hard production order. We don't want to let anybody down on our anticipated delivery dates, therefore we cannot offer refunds once the campaign has ended at the end of March.</p><p><strong>Can I pay extra to get an earlier delivery?</strong><br/>This is unfortunately not possible. It is not so much a matter of extra costs, but a matter of making sure that we produce the collection in the best way, to ensure superior quality of each order.</p><p><strong>Will I have to pay duties/VAT to receive my perk?</strong><br/>We will do our upmost to prevent this from happening! However,  any applicable duties/VAT are the sole responsibility of the backer, and not our team. We have absolutely no control over the additional duties/VAT that may or may not be charged within your country. If you are unsure whether or not you will be charged duties/VAT at the time of receiving your perk, please get in touch with your local post office.</p><p><strong>What if something is wrong with my order upon receiving it?</strong><br/>In the very exceptional case of this happening, we will of course offer you the best service to find a suitable solution for you.

We don't want to let anybody down on our anticipated delivery dates, therefore we cannot offer refunds once the campaign has ended at the end of March.Can I pay extra to get an earlier delivery?This is unfortunately not possible.

<p>For our launch, we've identified four social issues and partnered with charities that are dedicated to make a difference in those areas. For each purchase made, one charity will be able to further its efforts to change lives.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing, we realize that you want to rock your favorite color shades while supporting your cause. So rather than associating the frame colors to each cause, we decided to change our logo color for each one instead! Our logo is merely a representation of the social impact that we all can have on the world, and we want it to reflect that. </p>

<p>Banga is the Lithuanian word for  “wave”. For us, it embodies the idea that even a small gesture of kindness can make a difference in someone’s life. We want to empower our consumers to make waves, so we’ve partnered with four charities and researched the projects that best align with the causes we have chosen to tackle first.</p>
<p>For each cause, we’ve measured the wave of impact, so you can see how you are making a difference!</p>

<p><span>For many children around the world, education is limited by poverty. Lack of finances for school fees, transportation and supplies keeps countless students from graduating, while others drop out early to help support their families. As a result, many earn low wages throughout their lives. Children International established the HOPE (Helping Overcome Poverty through Education) Fund to help fight this tragic cycle. Each year, over 2,000 youth earn HOPE scholarships to complete secondary school or continue their education in vocational schools and universities. For every 20 pair of Bangas purchased, we will fund one HOPE scholarship.</span></p>

<p>Banga Sunglasses began as a desire to combine a compassion for those going through hardship with the ability to implement change. We knew that we wanted to provide an avenue for people with the same passion as we have to affect the world around them. We also happen to LOVE sunglasses and noticed that they are many consumer’s favorite accessory. For some, sunglasses finish off the perfect look, and for others they provide a chill retreat from the elements around them.</p>
<p>Our goal is to use Banga Sunglasses to manifest a vision for a better world and help those who may otherwise feel hopeless.  After months of working with manufacturers and charities, we are finally ready to invite you to join us on this journey.  We need additional funds to have more Bangas produced, and to invite others to join the movement. It takes the collective power of many to create the sweeping wave of impact that we hope to achieve, and with your help, through telling your friends via word of mouth, social media, and every other means possible, we can make this journey an epic one.</p>

UPDATE: Bangas are in and prepped for delivery! Thanks for your patience! 

 
UPDATE:Our campaign is over, but our mission to still going strong! Thanks to everyone who contributed to the cause! 

 
 
Banga Sunglasses is on a mission to impact the world. We want to pair consumers’ love of sunglasses with their desire to help others.
                                                       
For our launch, we've identified four social issues and partnered with charities that are dedicated to make a difference in those areas. For each purchase made, one charity will be able to further its efforts to change lives.

Here’s the thing, we realize that you want to rock your favorite color shades while supporting your cause. So rather than associating the frame colors to each cause, we decided to change our logo color for each one instead! Our logo is merely a representation of the social impact that we all can have on the world, and we want it to reflect that. 


This design allows you to express your style, while making your wave of impact. The logo variety also allows for multiple color combinations if you decide to support more than one cause.
                               

Banga is the Lithuanian word for  “wave”. For us, it embodies the idea that even a small gesture of kindness can make a difference in someone’s life. We want to empower our consumers to make waves, so we’ve partnered with four charities and researched the projects that best align with the causes we have chosen to tackle first.
For each cause, we’ve measured the wave of impact, so you can see how you are making a difference!
                       
                     
                     
                      

   
Malnutrition contributes to 2.6 million deaths of children under five each year - one third of the global total.  Convoy of Hope has feeding initiatives all over the world and are dedicated to helping this cause. It also provides clean and safe water, teaches community leaders agricultural techniques and helps provide healthy living environments and education. For every two Banga’s purchased, Convoy of Hope can feed a child for 1 month.
 
Limited access to clean drinking water, insufficient sanitation and poor hygiene kill more people than wars, famine, and AIDS combined. Generosity Water is committed to providing villages with access to clean drinking water. Two Banga’s purchased, provides 1 person with access to clean water for 20 years.
 
For many children around the world, education is limited by poverty. Lack of finances for school fees, transportation and supplies keeps countless students from graduating, while others drop out early to help support their families. As a result, many earn low wages throughout their lives. Children International established the HOPE (Helping Overcome Poverty through Education) Fund to help fight this tragic cycle. Each year, over 2,000 youth earn HOPE scholarships to complete secondary school or continue their education in vocational schools and universities. For every 20 pair of Bangas purchased, we will fund one HOPE scholarship.
 
Four million pets are euthanized each year in animal shelters instead of adoption. Best Friends is home to the nation's largest no kill animal sanctuary, where they rescue the abandoned domestic animals care for them for rest of their life whie trying to find them a home. For every Banga purchased, eight abandoned animals are fed and cared for.
 
Each pair of Bangas is made with high quality materials for long lasting durability. Our launch includes two different collections, the Classics and the Aces. The Classics line features a spring temple that allows the sunglasses to conform to the width of your head for added comfort. The Classics come in six colors with a rubberized coating for a sleek look and non-slip feel.The Aces line features front frames made from chrome, ensuring that your favorite pair of Bangas will last for many years. The Aces come in 3 colors, Black , Red, and Navy.  Both styles are fitted with high quality polycarbonate lenses.

Banga Sunglasses began as a desire to combine a compassion for those going through hardship with the ability to implement change. We knew that we wanted to provide an avenue for people with the same passion as we have to affect the world around them. We also happen to LOVE sunglasses and noticed that they are many consumer’s favorite accessory. For some, sunglasses finish off the perfect look, and for others they provide a chill retreat from the elements around them.
Our goal is to use Banga Sunglasses to manifest a vision for a better world and help those who may otherwise feel hopeless.  After months of working with manufacturers and charities, we are finally ready to invite you to join us on this journey.  We need additional funds to have more Bangas produced, and to invite others to join the movement. It takes the collective power of many to create the sweeping wave of impact that we hope to achieve, and with your help, through telling your friends via word of mouth, social media, and every other means possible, we can make this journey an epic one.

Any Questions?
When will I receive my Bangas?
Estimated shipping date for all campaign orders is July 2013. The goal of our campaign is to raise funds to get more Bangas produced and out to you!
So, I can order any style/color Bangas regardless of the cause?

How do I select my style/color of Bangas after I back the campaign?
Upon receiving your order, we will send out a survey allowing you to select which style/color of Bangas you want and which cause you would like to support. We will also confirm your shipping address.

<h2>Every dress tells a story</h2>
<p>At <em>Symbology, </em>we envision fashion as<em> </em>a platform to empower women, preserve traditional artforms and promote sustainable development. We fuse handmade artisan textiles with trend-forward design to create apparel with an authentic global connection--one that creates a sense of shared humanity between our customers and artisan producers.</p>
<p>I'm Marissa, the founder of Symbology, and I have been dreaming of launching a fashionable yet ethical line since my first trip to India in 2006 visiting craftswomen. While a fashionista on the outside, I'm a hippie at heart. I believe it is my true calling in life, and I can't wait to see what the future holds!</p>
<p>I have fused my background in Anthropology and Journalism from UNC with a deep passion for designing apparel with meaning.</p>
<h2><strong>We want you to take part in our first production trip to India!</strong></h2>
<p>We are very excited to be launching our first-ever collection, Peacocks &amp; Paisleys, for Fall/Winter 2012. We are asking for at least $7500 via our Indiegogo campaign to help cover our production trip to India, in which Marissa will visit our artisan groups first-hand to be able to bring our collection to the market for the Fall shopping season. She needs to get there before the monsoon season hits in July, when the artisans aren't able to block print due to the moistness in the air. Plus being drenched is just not a good look for her.</p>
<p>With your support, she will be able to visit groups in Jaipur, Varanasi and the Himalayas and provide real-time coverage of the collection's development...and your very own Indiegogo rewards! Take a gander at our collection: <a href=""http://issuu.com/mheyl/docs/symbology_lookbook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://issuu.com/mheyl/docs/symbology_lookbook</a></p>
<p><img alt=""Cuties Clutches are some of the many perks for donating to our campaign"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/5561/2clutches.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<div>
<p>We also hope to bring our new designer Tiffany with us to visit the groups and take part in the development of our next collection. Tiffany has dedicated years to serving <em>Virsa Punjab Da</em>, a South Asian nonprofit that provides aid for orphans, widows, and the elderly. She is very excited about the prospect of visiting with artisans and learning more about traditional crafts from her parents' native India. </p>
<p>We also plan to allocate funds this summer to build an e-commerce website, which will cut down on overhead costs and allow us to not only reinvest in our artisan partnerships, but form more personalized relationships with our new customers.</p>
<p>With each Symbology contribution, you are investing in a style-forward, one-of-a-kind label that empowers women across the globe. And we thank you kindly for it! Please check out our awesome rewards--all handmade, one-of-a-kind pieces connected with centuries of artistic tradition.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, we will use all of the funds towards this production trip. </p>
<h2>Our philosophy</h2>
<p><em>True art is evidence of happiness, contentment &amp; purity of its authors.</em></p>
<p>-Mahatma Gandhi</p>
<p>Our goal at Symbology is to alleviate the effects of poverty and improve the livelihoods of artisan producers and their families in developing countries. Artisan enterprises have great potential for spurring economic growth and often provide a vital income source for families in the poorest segments of society. </p>
<p>The textile traditions we source in our collections are embedded in Indian culture. Yet as demand drops and industrialization drives younger generations to pursue jobs in the cities, many century-old traditions are struggling to survive.</p>
<p>There are 1.3 billion people living on less than $1 a day, 70% of whom are women. When given the opportunity to earn an income, women overwhelmingly invest in their children’s education and health, as well as the overall community.  We view women's empowerment as a way to reverse the cycle of poverty and promote sustainable development.</p>
<p>Over the next 5 years, Symbology will have a team of 10-15 full-time employees based in North Carolina. Our production will take place both locally and globally, fueled by purchasing fabrics with artisan groups in India, Africa, and Latin America. We aim to employ a local garment co-op to construct our pieces as a way to bring our story of sustainability full circle.</p>

At Symbology, we envision fashion as a platform to empower women, preserve traditional artforms and promote sustainable development. We fuse handmade artisan textiles with trend-forward design to create apparel with an authentic global connection--one that creates a sense of shared humanity between our customers and artisan producers.
I'm Marissa, the founder of Symbology, and I have been dreaming of launching a fashionable yet ethical line since my first trip to India in 2006 visiting craftswomen. While a fashionista on the outside, I'm a hippie at heart. I believe it is my true calling in life, and I can't wait to see what the future holds!
I have fused my background in Anthropology and Journalism from UNC with a deep passion for designing apparel with meaning.
We want you to take part in our first production trip to India!
We are very excited to be launching our first-ever collection, Peacocks & Paisleys, for Fall/Winter 2012. We are asking for at least $7500 via our Indiegogo campaign to help cover our production trip to India, in which Marissa will visit our artisan groups first-hand to be able to bring our collection to the market for the Fall shopping season. She needs to get there before the monsoon season hits in July, when the artisans aren't able to block print due to the moistness in the air. Plus being drenched is just not a good look for her.
With your support, she will be able to visit groups in Jaipur, Varanasi and the Himalayas and provide real-time coverage of the collection's development...and your very own Indiegogo rewards! Take a gander at our collection: http://issuu.com/mheyl/docs/symbology_lookbook


We also hope to bring our new designer Tiffany with us to visit the groups and take part in the development of our next collection. Tiffany has dedicated years to serving Virsa Punjab Da, a South Asian nonprofit that provides aid for orphans, widows, and the elderly. She is very excited about the prospect of visiting with artisans and learning more about traditional crafts from her parents' native India. 
We also plan to allocate funds this summer to build an e-commerce website, which will cut down on overhead costs and allow us to not only reinvest in our artisan partnerships, but form more personalized relationships with our new customers.
With each Symbology contribution, you are investing in a style-forward, one-of-a-kind label that empowers women across the globe. And we thank you kindly for it! Please check out our awesome rewards--all handmade, one-of-a-kind pieces connected with centuries of artistic tradition.
Even if we don't reach our goal, we will use all of the funds towards this production trip. 
Our philosophy
True art is evidence of happiness, contentment & purity of its authors.
-Mahatma Gandhi
Our goal at Symbology is to alleviate the effects of poverty and improve the livelihoods of artisan producers and their families in developing countries. Artisan enterprises have great potential for spurring economic growth and often provide a vital income source for families in the poorest segments of society. 
The textile traditions we source in our collections are embedded in Indian culture. Yet as demand drops and industrialization drives younger generations to pursue jobs in the cities, many century-old traditions are struggling to survive.
There are 1.3 billion people living on less than $1 a day, 70% of whom are women. When given the opportunity to earn an income, women overwhelmingly invest in their children’s education and health, as well as the overall community.  We view women's empowerment as a way to reverse the cycle of poverty and promote sustainable development.
Over the next 5 years, Symbology will have a team of 10-15 full-time employees based in North Carolina. Our production will take place both locally and globally, fueled by purchasing fabrics with artisan groups in India, Africa, and Latin America. We aim to employ a local garment co-op to construct our pieces as a way to bring our story of sustainability full circle.

<p>Back in the early 2011, we, an online community of photographers on social network <a href=""https://plus.google.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Google+</a> thought it might be a fun idea to get together and publish a photography book containing some of our favorite photographs taken in the year just ended.

<p>As a result, we published two beautiful photography books in print and ebook formats containing photographs from hundreds of photographer from 50+ countries around the world. Both volumes of the book shipped to 60+ countries. More importantly, we raised over $20,000 and donated that money to charitable organizations.

If you didn’t know better, you would hastily conclude that fashion brands came together and agreed on a single design, refusing to innovate or try anything new. This is indeed very sad because like any other accessory, belts are amazing ways to express your personality and sense of fashion. You put on a pair of shoes, you pick out some new glasses, and then what – you grab a belt out of the many similar and mono-styled designed ones from the clearance shelf? As if the lack of creativity wasn’t devastating enough, most belts are grossly over-designed, unnecessarily ornate to the point that they fail at their basic function and essentially become a burden to carry around the waist.</p><div data-id=""29362552""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1593618371/olib4diujjl6kl6b2xle.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The most stunning innovations that make you say ""Wow!"" are the ones that solve the problems that we face in our day to day lives – from a vantage point that is entirely out of the ordinary. The best innovations, of course, are simple. This is the belief that has inspired and guided our sense of design and style at MINism.</p> <p><strong>Our Principles</strong></p>
<p>Simplicity is both surprising and awe-inspiring because it comes out of nowhere. This description epitomizes MIN BELT. We have created a belt for you that is both new, classic, refreshing and better than what is obtainable. MIN BELT is the definition of creativity and ingenuity. It is a break from the norm; it is a vanguard in its own right. We strive to continue to push the limits and think outside the box for the right reasons. We believe that there can never be an end to innovation and that is what drives us at MINism. We are not just a fashion company; we are an evolutionary company.</p>

</div></div></figure></div></div>","Let’s Talk About BeltsTake a look at the belt section of any clothing or fashion store, and you will instantly notice that they all have the same mundane look, almost like the industry is completely bereft of any unique ideas. If you didn’t know better, you would hastily conclude that fashion brands came together and agreed on a single design, refusing to innovate or try anything new. This is indeed very sad because like any other accessory, belts are amazing ways to express your personality and sense of fashion. You put on a pair of shoes, you pick out some new glasses, and then what – you grab a belt out of the many similar and mono-styled designed ones from the clearance shelf? As if the lack of creativity wasn’t devastating enough, most belts are grossly over-designed, unnecessarily ornate to the point that they fail at their basic function and essentially become a burden to carry around the waist.
    MIN BELT…is a break from the uninspiring norm.We were tired of the conventional and needlessly sophisticated style of belts that have long overstayed their welcome. Therefore, we decided to engineer a truly simple but yet stylish and never before seen kind of belt. A belt you can comfortably wear for years, a belt you can wear with any outfit, and a belt that will finally complement your personality. 
 
  Troubled by the direction the belt fashion was headed, we decided to stop the distressing trend by designing a new and ingenious kind of belt called “ACTION BELT” for an active lifestyle and a wide range of activities. The idea was to build something new, durable, and versatile; a belt that will stand the test of time and come to mean more than just a belt, but also your everyday companion. Whether you are rocking a professional look, a casual appearance, or dawning a sporty look, MIN BELT will do wonders to your overall outfit. When you wear MIN BELT, you instantly feel the connection; you should feel like the belt is part of you and the belt should complement you and what you stand for. 
MIN BELT is an ACTION BELT ready for extreme.
 Belts can make or break your dressing. Worn for both style and function, this small accessory can have a tremendous impact on the impression you make.We created the MIN BELT to make you stand out from the crowd. The minimalistic design that sets you apart from everybody else with a blend of both a classic and contemporary look all meshed together to give you that dapper look and allow you to freely express your personality. Designed for Active Lifestyle  MIN BELT is a simple, adjustable buckle design that completely removes all the unnecessary and complicated features that you have come to associate with everyday belts. MIN BELT does away with belt holes, flap and unnecessarily ornate belt designs by providing a refreshing, unique and personalized experience that conventional belts can neither match nor offer.
MIN BELT has none of these problems.  Most people have between three to six belts for various occasions (casual, formal, sporty) and in numerous colors, occupying limited space in your wardrobe. But, imagine if you had just one belt for every occasion, one belt that looked good with every dress, one belt that was perfect for any activity? With MIN BELT, Less is really MORE. One MIN BELT is enough. 
MIN BELT for Minimalist Lifestyle
 
 Unlike other belt designs, MIN BELT allows you to design and wear it how you want to fully express your personality and style based on several wearable styles and choices. We believe in freedom of style and versatility in use, so there is no right or wrong way to wear the MIN BELT. Add variety to your daily style with 4 strap colors from two reversible color straps and 4 buckle colors; giving you plenty of color combinations that you can mix and match with your outfit to match your style. 
  The belt is the dirtiest wearable item on our body. It is an abundant house of germs and fungi since most belts can not be washed. No surprise that most belts smell bad. MIN BELT is waterproof and not absorb moisture. It is also a washable belt. That's why MIN BELT is the most hygienic belt you can live with. The PVD MIN BUCKLE is free of any form of Nickle allergy, while the MIN STRAP is made from a premium fine-grade material. Besides, the manufacturing process is strict and carefully monitored to ensures that there are no dangers of skin allergies while providing an easy-to-clean surface and washable feature.   Our first crowdfunding campaign generated more than $52,000. It is more than 10 times of our target. There and then, we knew that we were on to something amazing. The support and faith we received were tremendous from plenty of positive feedback from users. We were finally going to make a belt that would appeal to many, a belt that would break the mundane cycle of poorly designed belts.MIN BELT was a novel product. Despite selling thousands of the original version, we knew we could do better … and so we did!  
 
 


 

 
 
MIN BELT by MINism Featured in
  
We have drawn inspiration from both your valuable feedback and our hunger to innovate and design an all-new and improved MIN BELT. While fans of the original MIN BELT will instantly recognize the minimalist design, this is an entirely new product.   The NEW MIN BUCKLE has an ergonomic curve, making the belt even more comfortable to wear.MIN BUCKLE has the most efficient mechanism without moving parts. It is created out of a single piece of stainless steel and transformed through Laser cutting, forming, sandblasting, and a jewelry-grade PVD (Physical Vapor Disposition) finish. MIN BUCKLE will last forever with a lifetime warranty. 
New MIN BELT - Ergonomic Curve
  Also, the NEW MIN STRAP has The Seamless 2 in 1 Color Reversible Strap Technology, allowing you to juggle between colors based on your outfit or preference.MIN STRAP is a 35mm wide premium-grade polymer-based webbing reinforced structure that is designed for all environments. The strap has a great look and touching feel with a similar texture to leather but a lot more durable. The Superb Quality Seamless 2 in 1 Color Reversible Strap
 
Superb Quality from The Latest Color Reversible Strap Technology 
MIN BUCKLE and STRAP Dimensions
  At this point, you may be wondering, oh, what makes a ‘perfect belt’? What’s wrong with the current belt I own? And how can this new belt be any different? Well, since you asked, we will be glad to explain. Allow us to intimate you on some of the main reasons why the NEW MIN BELT is nothing like your regular belt. 
20 Features in 1 Minimalist Belt for Active Lifestyle   The MIN BELT features a new buckle mechanism that allows for a seamless buckling and unbuckling experience. Want to quickly remove your belt to pass security? Simply remove the buckle in less than a second and breeze through. This patent-pending buckle design was engineered with versatility and functionality in mind.   The curve buckle design blends well on your waist feels like wearing nothing. 
  Want to rock a brown belt instead of a black one? All you have to do is swap the sides of your MIN BELT. Want to change your look, just swap your silver buckle with the black one.Reversible and Interchangeable  Those belt holes may feel strong on the first day, but never after the first week of wearing a new belt. The flap? Needless and ugly. The loop? Just an excuse to make you pay more. MIN BELT wants you to do away with holes, loops and flaps that ruin your appearance.MIN BELT has no holes, no flap, no necessities.
  Did you put on or shed some weight recently? Well, that shouldn’t be one of your reasons for changing a belt. The MIN BELT can be fitted and adjusted as precise as you want without hole limitation, adapting perfectly whenever you gain or lose weight. 
  Unlike most traditional belts, the durability of the high-grade material of a well-constructed strap ensures that kinks do not appear over-time, like with the MIN STRAP. This means that your MIN BELT will outlive most of your trousers and remain as good as new.No More Kink Belt
 
 
MIN BELT, No Kink
  Every MIN BELT is handmade and crafted with precision. We pay close attention to detail by using only premium grade stainless steel and refined polymer-based webbing reinforced strap material with the help of some of the finest craftsmen. The result? A durable, top quality and premium product that is definitely one of the best currently in the market. MIN BELT ... Premiums ... you can feel. 
Premium Material, Superb Quality Belt
 
   The unique buckling and unbuckling system allow you to take off just the buckle instead of the entire belt when you have to go through a security scan. With the MIN BELT, you never have to deal with the hassle of completely removing and wearing back your belt. In extreme situations, this can be the difference between catching and missing a flight.Quick and easy to use   If you are a traveler or frequent flyer, especially on business trips, then you must appreciate the convenience of traveling light. The MIN Buckles are easy to pack, and you can fit multiple buckles into a tiny cabin suitcase, giving you unlimited styles to choose from.   Caught in the rain? Or want to toss it into the laundry machine? Feel free, because the MIN BELT is made from water-resistant, rust and corrosion-resistant materials that hold well against any wet situation.Water-Friendly, Able to Clean
  Grab your belt then smell it. You will know what a belt not supposed to be. The belt is the bacteria and germ crowded house cause of the unpleasant smell, but not with MIN BELT. All dirt, germ, bacteria, fungi can be wash out like your cloth without ruining the belt.   No Animal was harmed, whether directly or indirectly in the production of MIN BELT. Our durable stainless-steel buckle is made from pure materials and high-end PVD process without the use of any harmful chemicals. Also, our durable strap is synthetic and completely replaces leather which create pollution. MIN BELT production is short and consumes low energy. This ultimately makes this belt an eco-friendly and cruelty-free wardrobe accessory.
 
MIN BELT is eco-friendly.   The MIN BELT was built with ample longevity in mind. This belt will not wear or tear even you use it regularly. In fact, make it your everyday belt and watch it retain the same shine and appeal it had when you first bought it. 

  The ""M-I-N"" typographic design buckle, symbolizing the minimalistic design that sets you apart from everybody else.   If your belt is dirty, just wash it.

PERFECT FIT:</b>   In this ever-changing world, you need a belt that adapts with you, every<i>1/4 inch </i>of the way. Trakline belts conform to your exact waist size, every time you put it on.<br/><br/><b>2. ADJUSTABILITY:</b>   It's true, Trakline belts are 8X's more adjustable than traditional belts. That's because they offer over 40 sizing positions to choose from. Traditional belts have only 5.<br/><br/><b>3. NO HOLES:</b>   That's right.  No more worn-out, stretched-out, augmented, poor-fitting belt holes to deal with. Instead a modern, hidden trak system that lasts longer and conforms to your precise waist size. <br/><b><br/>4. QUALITY:</b>   We only make products that we want to wear &gt;&gt; and we like quality stuff. The buckles are high-grade alloy and the belts are full-grain leather (best available leather).<br/><br/><b>5. GUARANTEE:</b>   If you don't love your belt, just return it within 30 days and we'll refund your money. Why are we doing this ? Because 99% of folks love their belts - they tell us so.

It's that simple. Not only do Trakline belts fit a lot better than traditional belts, but they're easier to take on and off, and no belt holes to wear out. Watch the video and see for yourself - because seeing is believing... </p><p><b>OUR STORY </b>About two years ago my wife bought me an expensive, designer belt for my birthday. She wanted to upgrade my wardrobe. Unfortunately for me, the belt holes didn't line up with my waist size that day.  So I did what a lot of guys have done, I added a couple holes.  But in the process &gt;&gt; I ruined the belt.  Needless to say, my wife was not happy<b>. </b></p><a href=""http://www.koreessentials.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt='""Eclipse"" gunmetal [standard 3.5 cm / 1.4""&gt;' class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/006/527/91f578eb8cf92017342f36a14ab3e5fb_large.jpg?1400023292"" src="""" style=""""/>""Eclipse"" gunmetal [standard 3.5 cm / 1.4""]</figure><p></p></a><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><b>INSPIRATION   </b>I learned 2 simple lessons that day.  First, never puncture any gift from your wife and second &gt;&gt;  belt holes don't work all that well. Not much of a surprise, considering they were introduced during the ""Dark Ages"" (1,000+ years ago) and haven't changed much since. </figure><p><br/><strong>YOUR WAIST AND YOU  </strong>Consider that as you work, walk, eat, sleep, play - your waist fluctuates. Unfortunately, traditional belts only offer a few 1 inch spaced holes. Who's waist fluctuates 1 inch at a time?  Not mine, and I doubt yours does either. So I made it my mission to find a better fitting belt with style. But when I scoured the marketplace for a product that could adapt to my ever-changing waist size AND look good doing it... I came up empty. That's when I got inspired to create a whole new kind of belt.</p><a href=""http://www.koreessentials.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt='""Intrepid"" nickel [standard 3.5 cm / 1.4""&gt;' class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/006/502/66e3c5f8514e584f24fbb48d22f74c25_large.jpg?1400022989"" src="""" style=""""/>""Intrepid"" nickel [standard 3.5 cm / 1.4""]</figure><p></p>

Instead a modern, hidden track system and a unique, patent-pending buckle create a  perfect fit every time you put it on - no matter what your waist size is at the moment.                                        WHAT MAKES OUR BELTS SO UNIQUE ?1. PERFECT FIT:   In this ever-changing world, you need a belt that adapts with you, every1/4 inch of the way. Trakline belts conform to your exact waist size, every time you put it on.2. ADJUSTABILITY:   It's true, Trakline belts are 8X's more adjustable than traditional belts. That's because they offer over 40 sizing positions to choose from. Traditional belts have only 5.3. NO HOLES:   That's right.  No more worn-out, stretched-out, augmented, poor-fitting belt holes to deal with. Instead a modern, hidden trak system that lasts longer and conforms to your precise waist size. 4. QUALITY:   We only make products that we want to wear >> and we like quality stuff. The buckles are high-grade alloy and the belts are full-grain leather (best available leather).5. GUARANTEE:   If you don't love your belt, just return it within 30 days and we'll refund your money. Why are we doing this ? Because 99% of folks love their belts - they tell us so. So we're confident you will too. ""Intrepid"" nickel buckle [standard width 3.5 cm / 1.4""]SO HOW'S IT WORK ? Trakline belts lock firmly at your exact waist size - every time you put it on. To remove or adjust, pull the small tab under the buckle. It's that simple. Not only do Trakline belts fit a lot better than traditional belts, but they're easier to take on and off, and no belt holes to wear out. Watch the video and see for yourself - because seeing is believing... OUR STORY About two years ago my wife bought me an expensive, designer belt for my birthday. She wanted to upgrade my wardrobe. Unfortunately for me, the belt holes didn't line up with my waist size that day.  So I did what a lot of guys have done, I added a couple holes.  But in the process >> I ruined the belt.  Needless to say, my wife was not happy. ""Eclipse"" gunmetal [standard 3.5 cm / 1.4""]INSPIRATION   I learned 2 simple lessons that day.  First, never puncture any gift from your wife and second >>  belt holes don't work all that well. Not much of a surprise, considering they were introduced during the ""Dark Ages"" (1,000+ years ago) and haven't changed much since. YOUR WAIST AND YOU  Consider that as you work, walk, eat, sleep, play - your waist fluctuates. Unfortunately, traditional belts only offer a few 1 inch spaced holes. Who's waist fluctuates 1 inch at a time?  Not mine, and I doubt yours does either. So I made it my mission to find a better fitting belt with style. But when I scoured the marketplace for a product that could adapt to my ever-changing waist size AND look good doing it... I came up empty. That's when I got inspired to create a whole new kind of belt.""Intrepid"" nickel [standard 3.5 cm / 1.4""]
WHAT'S THE SECRET ?  Using a clever, hidden trak system, and our spring-loaded, patent-pending buckles, Trakline belts offer you 40+ sizing positions in 1/4"" increments. A regular belt has just 5. Sorry old belt. TRAKLINE 2.0  Last summer we launched our first line of Trakline on Kickstarter and were fortunate enough to attract over 4,000 backers who believed in us and the product ! So why are we crowdfunding again ? Simple. To launch Trakline 2.0.  We took your suggestions and comments, and created a NEW, IMPROVED line of STANDARD Style buckles and belts (3.5 cm / 1.4"") - AND - new line ofSLIM Style buckles and belts (2.5 cm / 1"" belts). To do all this we need your support to fund our first production run and get them into stores.              >> INTRODUCING OUR NEW TRAKLINE 2.0 BUCKLES << Buckles are high-grade alloy / belts are full-grain leather (highest available grade of leather) and come in your choice of black, medium brown and white.""Eclipse"" gunmetal [standard 3.5 cm / 1/.4""]

THE BOTTOM LINE   It's a fact we all know - belt holes stretch-out, wear-out, need supplementing and rarely seem to fit right. In this age of technology >> don't you think you deserve a belt that not only looks great, but fits great too - every time you put it on ? >> We think so.Gunmetal Buckles [standard 3.5 cm / 1.4""]

The trimmed end then snaps securely and easily into the buckle receptacle. The purpose for trimming, is to get your belt length within your ""waist range"", then the trak system can create your perfect fit every day, no matter what your waist size is.THE TEAM:  Steve> Manufacturing & Quality Control. Max> Product & Web Design.  Karl > Sales & Marketing  The three of us have been good friends and business associates for over 10 years. For the past 12 years Steve has overseen the manufacturing of a wide variety of high-quality apparel and accessories products. Max on the other hand, is an all-around talented designer, who's been crucial in creating our product designs, drawings and the website.

Together, the three of us make a great team.""Imagine"" gold [slim width 2.8 cm / 1.1""]
PRODUCTION PLAN  Once we complete the Kickstarter campaign we will immediately commence production. Based on the factories estimate, the manufacturing process should take approximately 30 days to complete. To save money, we're making the belts at a responsible overseas factory that we've employed before with great success. Once the production is completed, we will ship the belts to our warehouse in San Diego, California, and then repackage individual orders to ship out to backers within about 2 weeks. It's that simple and that's how we did it before with success.""Endeavor"" gunmetal [3.5 cm / 1.4""]

Every Day.We asked over 1100 backers of the All Day Bag why they pledged for this project. Here are some of their answers ( and all the reasons why we created this bag):  THE ALL DAY BAG can be worn as a handbag, backpack, or a tote. Simply pull the straps to turn it into a whole new bag.  
 
Crafted from full-grain premium leather and designed to flatter the female silhouette, the ALL DAY BAG was made to elevate every outfit for any occasion.   Now you can do what you want with a bag that does it all. Our morning to moonlight ALL DAY BAG is a true multi-tasking masterpiece. Made for motion. Adjust the versatile straps to a luggage strap to maximize your bag's safety in transit. Wherever you’re headed this year, THE ALL DAY BAG has your back. Now available in Black Pebble Available in both soft pebbled full-grain leather or structured croc print full-grain leather, our ALL DAY BAG wears beautifully over time and feels memorably soft to the touch.  Built around the busy woman’s day THE ALL DAY BAG is intuitive to use. A secret phone pocket on the back and a thoughtfully curated interior ensure functionality remains chic.  A clip for keys, a 13” laptop sleeve, a notebook sleeve, pockets for your wallet, hand cream, sunglasses, a roomy zip pocket for valuables or chargers, a water bottle holder with an elasticated top, and two leather pen loops, two leather lipstick loops, ensure your everyday necessities stay organized and accessible.The main compartment is spacious enough to hold a 15” laptop, a cardigan, and even your to-go lunch.  THE ALL DAY BAG was designed for ease of access on-the-go with a fold-in top flap and a leather-covered magnetic closure.For a little peace of mind, we added a silver zipper closure underneath that’s as sturdy as it's striking.  Ready to take the plunge? Click Back This Project, and pick a reward. Add-OnsThese add-ons can only be purchased if an All Day Bag has been pledged. You will have access to add-on any of the items below in the survey once the campaign ends.Passport Wallets: $45The passport wallets fit any sized passport. They come with 4 card slots (credit cards, ID, green card, driver license), 2 SIM card slots (for international travel), a slot for the passport on the right and 2 slots on the left for your boarding pass and/or any other document.
 Zip Around Wallet: $45Our 2nd generation zip around wallet has been upgraded. It includes 4 card slots on the left. A place for cash fitting Euros, USD, Pounds, CAD and everything in between. On the right is a coin pouch and a few hidden slots underneath.
  Travel Pouches - $45Our classic travel pouch is the perfect companion for keeping your essentials within reach during your travels or for a night out. Bi-Fold Card Wallet - $35With 4 slots on the inside and 1 on the outside, this is the perfect minimalistic cardholder.
 
 
 The adjustable strap works like a wonder. Find your optimal strap length to easily switch from a handbag to a backpack, to a tote in one quick pull.
 Fold-in side gussets and a fold-in top flap allow for freedom to switch silhouettes and allow for further storage space. 
 Lightweight and easy to clean. Our wipeable technical nylon offers a luxe look and feel. It even looks good after a spill.
 Metal feet on the bottom to protect the All Day Bag.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Susan Pfeiffer and I live in Colorado with my wonderful family - my husband, 3 kids and Hoover.  I've been in the Computer Software industry for over 20 years although currently I'm a stay-at-home mom.  I volunteer at my kids schools and I've been a leader for my daughter's girl scout troop for the past 7 years.  I'm an inventer at heart as I'm always coming up with new ideas for inventions. Recently I invented a multifunctional dog leash that allows you to easily hook up your dog to any structure without unhooking the leash from your dog's collar.  I currently have a PATENT PENDING on this leash.</p>
<h2>How the Idea was Born</h2>
<p>I took my dog Hoover to the dog park one day in our van.  I had him tethered to a bracket on the floor of the van so he was secure on the ride there.  When I went to take him out of the van, he was jumping around with excitement because he knew we were at the dog park.  Once again, I had to hold him by the collar as I unhooked the leash with the other hand and fed the leash back through the bracket so I could hook him back up to walk into the dog park.  I thought ""THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY!""</p>
<h2>My Multifunctional Dog Leash</h2>
<p>I researched what was out there and came up with an idea that solved all my issues with my traditional leash.  Not only is it multifunctional, but it looks cool with the grommets!  There is a clasp at each end and grommet holes throughout the entire length of the leash.  Also at each end of the leash, there is double webbing so you can grab that ""handle"" while you're hooking or unhooking your dog from any structure.  </p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Clasps at each end so either end can be the handle</p>
<p>Grommet holes throughout the length of the leash so you can hook it around small or large structures</p>
<p>Double webbing at each end of the leash so you can securely grab the leash while you are hooking or unhooking your dog to the structure.</p>
<p>Can be hooked in the middle grommet to another leash so you can walk 2 dogs</p>
<p>Can be hooked around your waist for hands free walking</p>
<p>Grommet holes are strong enough to support the clasps</p>
<p>Grommet holes will not rust</p>
<p>The grommet holes lay flat so it is easy to roll up the leash</p>
<h2>How Will I Use the $5000</h2>
<p>Buy an industrial sewing machine so I can make the leashes myself to keep down costs.</p>
<p>Buy a grommet machine which will easily secure the grommets (instead of pounding them by hand)</p>
<p>Buy a variety of webbing - different colors, materials, widths, thickness, etc...</p>
<p>Buy a variety of grommets - metal, brass, colored, etc...</p>
<p>Buy a variety of clasps - metal, brass, trigger snaphooks, round eye snaphooks, carabiners, etc...</p>
<p>Develop a website</p>
<p>Marketing materials</p>
<p>Fees for Pet Expos</p>
<p>Trademark my name (which I'll update you on when I come up with my final decision)</p>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<p>I appreciate any support you can give so you'll get a big THANK YOU from me and Hoover no matter what!  If you contribute $25 or more, you'll receive a custom leash - you pick out the leash color, grommets and clasps.  As the contribution goes up, so do the number of leashes I will send you.  My highest perk is for a $250 contribution.  I've limited that perk to 8 because along with receiving multiple leashes, I will name a leash model after your special dog and include his/her picture and a short bio on the sales tag!</p>

<h3>Why are we doing this campaign?</h3>We want to extend our Rush brand / philosophy outside the studio walls and in to the community. There is no better way to do this than by wearing what you believe in - this is why we have decided to launch our official apparel line! We want to spread our energy, passion, vision and inspiration throughout the local community. </div><div>
<br/><h3>Tested in the field.</h3>For those of you who ride regularly at The Rush,  you may have noticed our Rockstar Instructors wearing our apparel prototypes. We wanted to ensure that not only is the apparel beautiful, but it is functional and comfortable to sweat in. Our instructors have given us the official two thumbs up, so we have decided to finally make it available to our community.  </div><div>
<p>We have spent endless hours curating, designing and testing our apparel to make sure we provide quality pieces that our clients would love. We created this line of apparel so that you could wear it to your next spin/yoga class, or wherever you decide to get your sweat on, and at the same time wear it out to the local coffee shop or farmer's market. </p>

For the past two and a half years, with two locations in San Diego, The Rush has been delivering the cardio experience Southern California has been waiting for. Our studio proudly delivers the endorphin high you crave in a boutique atmosphere that is unparalleled throughout the fitness industry. Whether you are a beginner or an elite athlete, The Rush provides the local community with the most efficient cardio workout while maintaining a premium level of quality, intimacy, and convenience. Our upbeat instructors will lead you through high intensity, low impact classes as you pedal through your fitness goals. Riding with us at The Rush energizes your mind, body, and soul and provides you with the perfect workout for a balanced lifestyle.








""We wanted to create an enjoyable workout experience in a non-intimidating environment."" 
From day one our main focus at The Rush has always been to build a tight-knit community of riders within our studios. We have accomplished something very special where our riders and instructors push and inspire one another to reach their personal goals, whether it be in fitness or in their lives outside of our studio. 




Why are we doing this campaign?We want to extend our Rush brand / philosophy outside the studio walls and in to the community. There is no better way to do this than by wearing what you believe in - this is why we have decided to launch our official apparel line! We want to spread our energy, passion, vision and inspiration throughout the local community. 
Tested in the field.For those of you who ride regularly at The Rush,  you may have noticed our Rockstar Instructors wearing our apparel prototypes. We wanted to ensure that not only is the apparel beautiful, but it is functional and comfortable to sweat in. Our instructors have given us the official two thumbs up, so we have decided to finally make it available to our community.  
We have spent endless hours curating, designing and testing our apparel to make sure we provide quality pieces that our clients would love. We created this line of apparel so that you could wear it to your next spin/yoga class, or wherever you decide to get your sweat on, and at the same time wear it out to the local coffee shop or farmer's market.

I found that I enjoyed designing bags the most because I could make them my style statement piece. Then I began to consult with friends to design bags that fit their personal needs, taste, and style as well. I loved seeing how excited they got realizing they were essentially the designer—I just made the sketches and final product. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Fast forward to 2014, after many years and many fails, I've developed anne b (middle name + last initial) into an authentic handbag brand that has experienced international sales and creditable local media recognition.</span></p><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><h3></h3>

It doesn’t matter if you have advanced sewing skills or if you’ve never even touched a sewing machine, anyone can come and learn stitching, mending, alterations, clothing construction, accessories, or home decor. Whatever you want to make — we’ll make it happen. About MeMy name is Sarah Burroughs. I grew-up in Virginia Beach, Virginia taking dance lessons, piano lessons, attending various art schools, participated in church and school choirs, and picked up sewing along the way. I'm practically a self-taught seamstress, initially out of frustration with tacky clothes and bags. I found that I enjoyed designing bags the most because I could make them my style statement piece. Then I began to consult with friends to design bags that fit their personal needs, taste, and style as well. I loved seeing how excited they got realizing they were essentially the designer—I just made the sketches and final product. Fast forward to 2014, after many years and many fails, I've developed anne b (middle name + last initial) into an authentic handbag brand that has experienced international sales and creditable local media recognition.
The MADE InspirationI was first inspired to create this sewing school while volunteering in Uganda last summer with HELP International. While there, I taught women and children skills like sewing, paper bead making, and marketing. Seeing how quickly they picked up these skills and their creativity was truly inspiring. When I got back to the States I knew I wanted to bring that same spirit of teaching, creativity, and innovation to the people around me.RewardsTo show my appreciation for your support of Made, you will receive a bag from a special collection under my label anne b appropriately called - The Made Collection. These cosmetic bags and folded clutches are made from 100% leather, bold kona cotton prints, bright colored lining, leather trimmed pockets, and durable brass zippers. And be your own designer by selecting your outer print and lining color!In staying true to the initial inspiration for this project, I have worked with local LDS and Catholic refugee organizations to identify skilled seamstresses who will then manufacture the bags and will be employeed through donations to this project. I will provide personal training and mentoring for the refugees to ensure quality craftsmanship.  This opportunity will empower the refugees with enhanced sewing skills for a greater chance at receiving full-time employment with anne b or with another employer. Choose Your Bag Choose Your Print Choose Your Lining WORKSHOP REGISTRATIONThose of you who live in northern Utah, you can reserve your spot in a sewing workshop to learn the basics, make a bag, skirt, or whatever it is you've been dying to make! Materials and machines provided for the workshops. Make a pledge and then I'll organize the various workshops according to your interests, skill level, and location. Invite your friends to register too!HARRISON DOPP KITWe did it! We made it to $7,500 and I've now released a reward level to claim anne b's first official men's product - Harrison Dopp Kit. Made from men's tweed coats, this bag provides the sophistication and durability needed for any of your travel needs. Also, there are only 5 dopp kits available in authentic Harris Tweed!TWSS""I'm so in love with it! I always shop for my boys so when I saw this.. I had to have it! Quality is amazing!"" Susan @susiescustom // Maker of custom babies clothing ""It's the perfect size and the craftsmanship is fantastic. I'm not a big shopper and don't buy many new things, but I'm so glad I ordered this - totally worth it :)"" Megan // First time buyer""She is incredibly personable and has the creative vision needed to accomplish just what you want! I am a fan of all things anne b!"" Laura  // Owner of an anne b custom bagFundsYour funds will go directly to the Made school to help pay for sewing machines, rental space, sewings tools and materials, and promotion throughout the valley.Timeline Funding campaign: June 26 - July 25Initial training for refugees: June 30 - July 25Customize your bag: July 26 - August 3Materials purchased: August 4Manufacturing begins: August  11Rewards delivered by: September 30 **Once we've reached $7,500 in pledges, I'll release anne b's first collection of men's dopp kits** WOOHOO!Thank You!I strongly believe that everyone has a spark of innovation and creativity in them no matter who or where they are. By supporting Made, you can help others realize their potential and maybe even help it come alive in you!Thank you so much for all of your support! I’ve put everything into this project and even quit my job to make this idea come to life. Any sort of contribution through sharing and donating that you can make means a lot. Thanks everyone!_________________________________________________________________________Risk and ChallengesAfter trying to balance anne b and the dream of the Made school with a full-time marketing job, I left that position last month to dedicate everything to opening this school. And now, I've had the privilege of receiving help from several genius friends from my advertising days at BYU contributing their talents to this campaign.I'm fully confident in this idea and with the quality and design of my products. If you experience any trouble with the products, I'll offer a complete refund, replacement or repair.Our goal is to fulfill all orders 4-6 weeks after they're placed. If by chance there is a delay, we will keep you posted on the progress of your item.And of course, after you receive your bag, come into Made and make your own!______________________________________________My video was made by Kickstarter Video - to learn more about getting your own crowdfunding video made, check out their site here: Kickstartervideo.net_________________________________________________________________________Featured InSold AtConnect with Me and anne bInstagramFacebookTwitterTumblrYouTubeanne b shopIn the beginning...In college, I created instructional YouTube videos.

The idea started to develop when founder, Brittany began to realize the lack of options for business casual clothing while she worked in New York City. After conversing with other young professionals, she came to the conclusion that the niche market for business casual clothing needed a change. Just because we work in a corporate setting doesn't mean we need to lack personality and style while also looking credible. In addition, she noticed the quality associated with these garments. The price point and the quality of fabric did not coincide. Her solution -  create a brand of clothing for both men and women that 1. fit the basic dress code of many corporate businesses, 2. functional for the everyday lifestyle, 3. stylish for outside of the office when needed. Brittany teamed up with her cousin, Brett to bring on a male style and design opinion and assist her on this crazy journey. Through workshops, many fabric swatch testing, design revamping, and LOTS of ""googling"" and youtube, we are here to present Caliber X's first collection. </p><ul></ul><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540220533/aewmzdt5l3nonwx5dffe.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We're committed to using environmentally friendly fabrics in our designs, that also look and feel great. For our collection, we used some of the following fabrics:</p><p><strong>Cupro (and Bemberg) - Lining for Men's Jacket and Women's Wrap Dress:</strong></p><ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Breathable – allows for moisture to evaporate while it also wicks sweat and humidity away from your body. </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Anti-Static – Provides more comfortable and allows for the garment to slide on and off very smoothly.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Environmentally Friendly – Biodegradable material; a greener alternative to synthetic fibres.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Affordable – Not cheaper than polyester, but more affordable than silk and represents incredibly good value for money. </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Durable – While a suit with a silk lining will cost more, you’ll likely need to replace that lining at some point. With proper care, a Cupro lined garment may not need to replace it at all.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Italian Wool - Main Fabric for Men's Jacket, Men's Trousers, and Women's Wrap Dres:</strong></p><ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Characterized by high elasticity; can reach an elasticity up to 18%</li>

We're building Caliber X into a leading lifestyle brand for socially conscious millennial consumers. 
 Our journey began over a year ago. The idea started to develop when founder, Brittany began to realize the lack of options for business casual clothing while she worked in New York City. After conversing with other young professionals, she came to the conclusion that the niche market for business casual clothing needed a change. Just because we work in a corporate setting doesn't mean we need to lack personality and style while also looking credible. In addition, she noticed the quality associated with these garments. The price point and the quality of fabric did not coincide. Her solution -  create a brand of clothing for both men and women that 1. fit the basic dress code of many corporate businesses, 2. functional for the everyday lifestyle, 3. stylish for outside of the office when needed. Brittany teamed up with her cousin, Brett to bring on a male style and design opinion and assist her on this crazy journey. Through workshops, many fabric swatch testing, design revamping, and LOTS of ""googling"" and youtube, we are here to present Caliber X's first collection.  We're committed to using environmentally friendly fabrics in our designs, that also look and feel great. For our collection, we used some of the following fabrics:Cupro (and Bemberg) - Lining for Men's Jacket and Women's Wrap Dress:
Breathable – allows for moisture to evaporate while it also wicks sweat and humidity away from your body. 
Anti-Static – Provides more comfortable and allows for the garment to slide on and off very smoothly.
Environmentally Friendly – Biodegradable material; a greener alternative to synthetic fibres.
Affordable – Not cheaper than polyester, but more affordable than silk and represents incredibly good value for money. 
Durable – While a suit with a silk lining will cost more, you’ll likely need to replace that lining at some point. With proper care, a Cupro lined garment may not need to replace it at all.
Italian Wool - Main Fabric for Men's Jacket, Men's Trousers, and Women's Wrap Dres:
Characterized by high elasticity; can reach an elasticity up to 18%
Guarantee a perfect fit with a performance ideal also for leisure
Supernova - Women's Trousers: 
Shrink and Wrinkle Resistance
Easy Washability & Incredible Elasticity with Good Return
Modified to Dry Quickly
Requires little or no pressing
Other fabrics included: 
Chinese Brocade Silk - Men's Shirt
Lambskin Leather - Trim on Women's Wrap Dress
Repreve Spandex - Bottom Half of Women's Bodysuit
Cotton Broadcloth - Main Fabric for Men's Shirt
Silk - Bodice of Women's Bodysuit

 **If something doesn't fit, we are happy to exchange it for another size if available. We cannot offer returns for Indiegogo orders.

Many of the employees have worked there for over a decade. We visit the factory often, and work together closely. We're committed to using responsible factories that pay legal wages, ensure workplace safety, and prohibit unlawful labor and discrimination. It's one of our passions to support companies that treat their employees with dignity and respect, and provide job opportunities in the U.S. If you are interested in learning more, or would like to write a story about us, you can download our press kit ""HERE"" or email Brittany @ info@caliberxco.comHow does the discount work?

</div></div>","Truly beautiful shoes are more than skin deep. Who makes them, where they're made and what they're made of, is everything. Part of Loyal Footwear’s mission is to improve footwear manufacturing and protect our planet by shattering the myth that animal leather equates to higher quality.
 

 
We're an all-women team making animal-free shoes of high style and comfort with sustainable methods where shoemakers earn fair wages in the USA. We are changing the dynamic of shoe making and availability by creating an accessibly-priced vegan shoe line, using the cleanest materials available, with a pricing structure to support being manufactured locally with love, right here, in-house. 
 

 
What we believe are the best ways of doing absolutely everything converge in this single collection. We use lower environmental-impact raw materials including vegan upper materials free of animal products and byproducts avoiding the toxic mess that is animal-hide tanning. Instead we use plant-based textiles such as Piñatex, recycled rubber, cork, ultrasuede linings with recycled fibers, and durable microfiber vegan leather — and absolutely everything we use is PVC-free.
 


 
Loyal shoes are designed to be durable and long-lasting. When you buy better, you buy less and own something you'll use everyday. 
 


 
They are also designed to be repairable. When the time comes, just send your shoes back to us. For a small fee we will revive your soles, significantly extending the shoes' lifecycle. 
 

 
We maintain a small inventory, creating less waste. The shoes are made-to-order, or made in small batches, then sold directly to you.
 

 
They're designed for everyday wear, prioritizing your comfort without compromising your style. We choose materials for their softness, flexibility, and quick break-in time and use a minimal amount of stabilizers and stiffeners for a generous, flexible fit.
 


 
Only 1% of shoes purchased in the USA are made in the USA. We want to increase the percentage of locally-made shoes purchased in the United States. We have all become accustomed to paying low prices for shoes as a result of outsourced production, too often to parts of the world that allow companies to exploit workers. By keeping production here in the United States, we ensure there is fairness in our production system from beginning to end.

 
Buying direct from us ensures the majority of what you spend goes directly to the shoemakers. 

 
Our shoes reflect our values — using materials of known origin and processing without animal products or byproducts. Leather is not just a passive byproduct of the meat industry. The skin of the animal is considered to be one of the most significant economic co-products of the meatpacking industry. 
Animal leather is often marketed as being ‘eco-friendly’ because it’s ‘biodegradable’ — neither of which are true. The whole point of tanning is to stop the leather from biodegrading by stabilizing the collagen and protein fibers. Making leather from animals is extremely destructive: trees are cut down to create pastureland, vast quantities of water are used, and run-off from feedlots is a major source of water pollution. This is why animal leathers receive such a high impact score on the Higg Index. 
 

Implementing a Sustainable Material Mix: The Higg Index is the measure of an apparel or footwear raw material’s environmental impact based on the combination of these four categories: 

Global Warming (emissions) 
Eutrophication (water pollution) 
Water Scarcity (water consumption) 
Abiotic Resource depletion (fossil fuels) 

Polyurethane alternatives to leather already have a low raw material impact (see below). Even more so if the durability and the full lifecycle of a complete shoe is accounted for. This is mostly due to the many advancements in microfiber vegan leathers that have made them stronger than their animal-derived counterparts. They are polishable and repairable, and are no longer subject to the cracking and peeling of leatherettes of yesteryear.

 
This Kickstarter will help us to...
 

 
make your shoes,
 

 
support our workers,
 

 
continue to innovate,
 

 
grow our staff,
 

 
and prove that it is possible to craft an affordably-priced shoe here in the U.S.

Contribute whatever you can, it all matters, every single dollar brings us all closer to our shared mission of making animal-free shoes here in the U.S. 

 









 

We have five beautiful, animal-free and PVC-free materials available across our eight styles. Your style/color choice will be collected in the survey at the end of the campaign so don’t worry, you have plenty of time to decide! 






 

Fortunately, we met our stretch goal of $45K on Kickstarter, so we now offer half sizes, larger sizes (12.5, 13, 13.5, 14), and wider widths!

<p>Did we mention we want to waterproof your life??? AQUA Waterproof Headwear is the ONLY line of fashionable yet TOTALLY WATERPROOF headwear. We were extremely frustrated with the existing options for keeping our hair dry at the beach and pool and in everyday inclement weather while maintaining our fashion style. Our options were either flimsy (plastic caps), or hot, tight and ugly (swim caps) and let’s face it, didn’t work! They make our scalp sweat, thus ruining our hair, and don’t totally protect from the moisture, water, rain or humidity. I think we can all relate to this. So WE CREATED A BETTER SOLUTION!

<p><strong>Any plans of making the Calabash out of stainless steel, aluminum or other material?</strong></p>
<p>Excellent question! We have searched high and low, and have spoken with dozens of expert bottle manufacturers. Due to the unique shape and our high standards to use a durable, non-leeching, eco-friendly (both pre-production AND post use) material, we arrived at the best choice: BPA-free, recyclable, high quality, HDPE. It maintains the perfect shape, preserves water to taste the way it should and keeps the harmful pollutants where they should be... out of your water and the environment.</p>

$20,000 is the bare bones required to begin production of the PLW Calabash. This includes the cost to create the mold, minimum order quantities (Calabash bottles, fabric cases/straps, patches), journals, bracelets, packaging, shipping, insurance and IndieGoGo fee's. 
Once we reach $20,000, any additional funding allows us to build our website, tell the story of the epic dude who inspired the Calabash and to continue our mission of doing what we do best: creating gear designed to better your journey.
 
What's the Calabash?
Only one of the most eye catching/unique/remarkable/comfortable and rad water containers of all time! We discovered the inspiration for it while on a wanderlust abroad, being used by a 19 year old kid named Henry.
The PLW Calabash design is based upon the original Calabash, a wearable water container that has been used for hundreds (some reports suggest, even thousands!) of years to carry water. We loved the concept, the story, and the fact that it had been a part of one mans journey for years... so we set out to design an urban friendly version. After many sleepless nights, VOILA! The first PLW Calabash was born.
 
The specs.
Each 'Bash holds 28 fl. oz, and is made from BPA-free, eco-friendly & recyclable, high quality HDPE. Each has a custom screw on/off top and an adjustable and removable case & strap.
Here are some of the things people are saying...
""The Calabash is so sweet! I love it!"" -Chris
""It's so comfortable and looks rad!"" -Daniel
""I LOVE the way it looks."" -Jill
""It has great feng shui!"" - Jackie
""I love lamp."" -Brick Tamland

<p>We are proud to introduce two large collections of watches produced with the highest degree of Swiss craftsmanship, catering to the desires and needs of every serious watch enthusiast. The collections are called DWISS RC1, a classic looking model with a centralized hour disc at the 12 o'clock mark, and DWISS RS1, a sporty collection that uses the DWISS signature time reading system.</p>
<p>In these collections, we are introducing for the first time in crowdfunding history a highly complicated Swiss-made watch, with the Tourbillon models . Our talking piece and the greatest watch ever presented to crowdfunding.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>In addition to the Tourbillon models, we also have automatic versions and quartz models. Each and every one is an original <strong>Swiss-made, limited edition timepiece</strong>, with an exclusive, <strong>innovative and award-winning time display system</strong>, which has become DWISS’ signature.  </p>

<p>One of the most challenging-to-make watch mechanisms, the tourbillon is a complicated movement that makes the escapement turn around its own axis, designed to counter the effects of gravity. By continuously rotating the entire balance wheel/escapement, the tourbillon averages out positional errors. Developed around 1795 and patented in 1801 by master watch-maker Abraham-Louis Breguet, the tourbillon is included in expensive watches made today by the most luxurious and traditional brands and is one of the most valued features for a collector in premium timepieces. The most virtuoso and desirable function in a watch mechanism that would once cost you 5 to 6 figures is offered for the first time in a crowdfunding campaign much much less. </p>

<p>“Vacchetta”: The cowhide is treated using vegetable tanning, an ancient process that certain tanneries are rediscovering. Vegetable means that metals such as chromium and other environmentally damaging substances are not used to treat the leather. In their place, tanning powders obtained from leaves, fruits, flowers and the roots of plants are used. Giving the skin an incredibly soft touch and the classic scent of leather.</p>
<p>- Pit Stop: The Pit Stop technical fabric is made of PVC. Thanks to its properties it is waterproof and resistant to scratches.</p>
<p>- “Saffiano”: Saffiano printing is made by embossing the typical cross-stitch pattern on the calfskin. After printing, the skin is treated with wax, making it resistant to scratches and giving a soft touch to the material.</p>

<p>Last year, with the help of our backers, we created the most innovative Swiss-made watch in crowdfunding history. The timepiece was awarded with the International Design Award, and Gold Award in the luxury category by the European Product Design AwardTM, awarded at a ceremony held at the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>

<p>Todays’ watchword in watchmaking is <b>micro brand</b>. Small-scale brands that are sought after by collectors, connoisseurs and watch lovers in search of uniqueness and value for their money.</p>
<p>Why? The traditional way of selling watches has all but been eliminated by the internet. The highly margined watch industry and the common, standard look of the timepieces; counterfeit watches all over the market; new brands being born every day selling fake luxury items; all these factors have contributed to the crisis in which the luxury watch market finds itself today.</p>

Our purpose is to bring you design and quality for the right price. We have been designing watches for more than a decade, and last year we introduced DWISS’ innovative time display system. The system was awarded two times in 2016, and one of the awards was granted at the European Parliament in Brussels. This year we are bringing back this system in one of our two new collections - RS1. The second one has a totally new display system - RC1. 


We are proud to introduce two large collections of watches produced with the highest degree of Swiss craftsmanship, catering to the desires and needs of every serious watch enthusiast. The collections are called DWISS RC1, a classic looking model with a centralized hour disc at the 12 o'clock mark, and DWISS RS1, a sporty collection that uses the DWISS signature time reading system.
In these collections, we are introducing for the first time in crowdfunding history a highly complicated Swiss-made watch, with the Tourbillon models . Our talking piece and the greatest watch ever presented to crowdfunding.
 
In addition to the Tourbillon models, we also have automatic versions and quartz models. Each and every one is an original Swiss-made, limited edition timepiece, with an exclusive, innovative and award-winning time display system, which has become DWISS’ signature.  

(from left to right: DWISS RC1 quartz, DWISS RC1 automatic, DWISS RS1 automatic, DWISS RS1 quartz) Time representation in fast forward. Quartz models have standard time reading system

 

 
 
  
 

 

 
 

                
One of the most challenging-to-make watch mechanisms, the tourbillon is a complicated movement that makes the escapement turn around its own axis, designed to counter the effects of gravity. By continuously rotating the entire balance wheel/escapement, the tourbillon averages out positional errors. Developed around 1795 and patented in 1801 by master watch-maker Abraham-Louis Breguet, the tourbillon is included in expensive watches made today by the most luxurious and traditional brands and is one of the most valued features for a collector in premium timepieces. The most virtuoso and desirable function in a watch mechanism that would once cost you 5 to 6 figures is offered for the first time in a crowdfunding campaign much much less. 
 
 

 
 
 


 

 

All our straps are 100% Italian made, respecting Italy’s tradition for leather goods, handcrafted by artisans in an authentic leather workshop. Produced by the same manufacturer that supplies the most renowned Italian luxury brands. Equipped with quick-release pins, the straps are easily interchangeable. 


“Vacchetta”: The cowhide is treated using vegetable tanning, an ancient process that certain tanneries are rediscovering. Vegetable means that metals such as chromium and other environmentally damaging substances are not used to treat the leather. In their place, tanning powders obtained from leaves, fruits, flowers and the roots of plants are used. Giving the skin an incredibly soft touch and the classic scent of leather.
- Pit Stop: The Pit Stop technical fabric is made of PVC. Thanks to its properties it is waterproof and resistant to scratches.
- “Saffiano”: Saffiano printing is made by embossing the typical cross-stitch pattern on the calfskin. After printing, the skin is treated with wax, making it resistant to scratches and giving a soft touch to the material.
 
 

Do you want to test the watch before pledging one? You can do so virtually by downloading the free APP, available for android and iOS. You can also make nice wrist shots like ours and be awarded. HAVE FUN!!!

 

 

 
 
 
 
 

DWISS is a multi award-winning company founded in Switzerland in 2011. The company creates limited-edition Swiss-made timepieces with unique time display systems, selling them for fair prices. We are proud to combine our avant-garde design with the tradition of Swiss watchmaking. 

Last year, with the help of our backers, we created the most innovative Swiss-made watch in crowdfunding history. The timepiece was awarded with the International Design Award, and Gold Award in the luxury category by the European Product Design AwardTM, awarded at a ceremony held at the European Parliament in Brussels.
ePDA - European Product Design Award ceremony in the European Parliament in Brussels
Todays’ watchword in watchmaking is micro brand. Small-scale brands that are sought after by collectors, connoisseurs and watch lovers in search of uniqueness and value for their money.
Why? The traditional way of selling watches has all but been eliminated by the internet. The highly margined watch industry and the common, standard look of the timepieces; counterfeit watches all over the market; new brands being born every day selling fake luxury items; all these factors have contributed to the crisis in which the luxury watch market finds itself today.

Rectangular case with rounded edges in polished silver tone. Brown Italian calf leather strap with tone-on-tone stitching TOUR Gradient Black. Gradient Black dial with applied silver tone indices and hands, and ""Tourbillon"" printed in white across the bottom of the dial.

Rectangular case with rounded edges in polished light rose gold tone. Dark Grey Italian calf leather strap with tone-on-tone stitching.    Inspired by the modern smartwatch, the LENVINO sports a rectangular case with rounded edges. The case is enclosed by a dome crystal on the front and a screw-down transparent caseback from the rear, allowing you to enjoy every movement of the Tourbillon.Viewed from the side, the dome crystal joins the case back flawlessly through a smooth curved surface. The streamlined case is more than just an elegant design feature – it also allows for a slimmer profile. The metal parts are made from 316L stainless steel, which translates to greater corrosion resistance and durability in high temperatures. Inspired by a minimalistic design, we stripped away all unnecessary elements from the dial, focusing exclusively on the Flying Tourbillon. The base of the dial is decorated with fine vertical lines / 3D wooden printed (Tour Wood & Black), giving it a brushed metal pattern effect / natural wood effect (Tour Wood & Back). The indices are kept to a minimal: numbered indices are displayed at 12, 3, and 9 o’clock positions, with the remaining indices baton-shaped.  Time is displayed by the Dauphine-style hands, which are tapered diamond-shape and faceted at the center. Aptly named, the hands are stylistically the most traditional, bearing a regal history and link to the King of France. The Flying Tourbillon can be found at the bottom of the dial and is surrounded by a brightness and sharpness diamond-like cutting edge. Our interchangeable watch straps are made from genuine Italian calf leather and come with polished 316L stainless steel buckles engraved with our brand name “LENVINO”. The straps have a width of 20mm x 18mm, a unisex functional length suitable for most customers, and 9 holes for adjustment.  They are available in six different colors and designs: (1) Light Brown with white stitching, (2) Brown with tone on tone stitching, (3) Black with white stitching, (4) Blue with tone on tone stitching (5) Dark grey with tone on tone stitching and (6) Black with tone-on-tone stitching  We believe that luxury timepieces should be exclusive and unique. Therefore, the first 100 pieces of each design will be Limited Edition and individually numbered. The watches will come engraved with “LIMITED EDITION” and “XXX/100” wording on the caseback and be accompanied by a certification card. Remarks: Please note that your Backer number may not correspond to the watch number you will receive, since some backers before you may have purchased multiple watches and the previous backers from Kickstarter.We will confirm your unique number with you once the campaign has finished. LENVINO Tour collection each colors produced after the first 100pcs will not be individually numbered or considered Limited Edition. We believe that a high quality, exclusive, well-designed watch should come in premium packaging. You will feel satisfied when you receive your watch.  1. Decide the “perk” you want to go for. Click the pink button that says, ""GET THIS PERK.""2. Fill out your shipping information and continue with your payment.3. Once the campaign is over, you will receive an email to choose your watch color, strap color,    limited edition number or request of information for the exclusive edition. After we had received your information, we will start production.**If we don’t reach our funding goal, you will receive your money back. 5-7 days after the campaign ends. We will ship the watches worldwide. Please note that you may be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable in your region. We expect to ship the watches from June 2018. While we will make every effort to ship your orders on time, we ask for your understanding that slight delays in production may be possible. We will keep you informed of any changes as they arise. All of our watches will come with a 1-year international warranty. The warranty will cover all parts against manufacturer defects, for which the watch will be repaired or exchanged free of charge.
 Keep your watch wound - Winding keeps the watch working, spreads the lubricants and the accuracy should be best with a fully wound watch.  

Please avoid any Bumps and Shocks - Shocks can damage any watch mechanism, scratches to the case or break the mirror. Remember your watch is a real “Tourbillon” consisted of more than hundreds tiny parts.     

Cleaning  - If your watch has become dirty, the best way to clean it is with a soft damp cloth.    

3ATM Water Resistance - Swimming, diving, showering, bathing, taking a jacuzzi or sauna, or any submersion in water whilst wearing your watch should be avoided 
 Please feel free to contact us at (info@lenvinowatch.com). We will always be here to answer any questions you may have.Risks and challengesAlthough we are new on Indiegogo and Kickstarter, we have over 28 years of solid experience in the watchmaking industry. We are aware that our project is complex and that there are always unforeseen issues. However, we are confident that our professional manufacturing partners can help us minimize the potential risks by deploying strict quality controls during the manufacturing process.Our manufacturers stand ready to begin production as soon as we meet our funding goal. Including the time needed to acquire the necessary parts, assemble the watches and perform all necessary checks, we anticipate that the first batch of orders will be delivered to you in about 3 months’ time from start of production. We will, of course, keep you updated on our progress throughout. Thank you to everyone who has supported the project from the start and to all our backers.",57.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My favorite thing about running a clothing business is making people feel special and beautiful.  While beauty is not a necessity per se, feeling good about oneself is.  In order to get through the day to day rigors, having actual high self esteem, not putting on airs and acting as though you do, is helpful.  Everyone of every age, race, gender and size should be able to feel like a prince or princess.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have been in business for eleven years and it has become quite clear that I have focused all of my energy and time on this one thing.  If BC doesn't continue to grow I will have to take several steps back and start all over.  This isn't just a dream that a spooky kid from a small town had 12 years ago anymore.  This is an actual business that not only affect myself, it affects my family, friends, clients, and fans.  If I can pick up steam I can hire employees, which creates jobs, which helps the economy.  If the in-take continues to go up I can afford insurance  so that when I start my family in the next couple of years I can take care of them without any outside help.  I can do even more in my charity work.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It's not only about being self sufficient and staying afloat, it's about contributing to society in a positive way.  </p>

Once he leaves I will be renting out my home studio to make ends meet and move my work space outside of the house to up productivity.</p>

She has also been featured or shown in magazines such as Shojo Beat, Minnesota Women’s Press, Five For Magazine, Pacific Rim Magazine, Runway, RX magazine, Vita.mn, City Pages, Ouch Magazine, Minnesota Public Radio, Gothic Beauty, Showcase Minnesota, and the American Gothic and Lolita Bible.In 1998, Samm began attending the Perpich Center for Arts Education in Golden Valley, Minnesota, choosing to focus on her skills as an illustrator and painter. After graduating in 1999, she spent a year at the College of Visual Arts (CoVA) in Saint Paul to major in illustration then continued her education at the Minneapolis Community and Technical College for Apparel Technologies.“I want people to feel what I feel when the girls wear these clothes. I want them to see how they own the look and become the person the dress was made for. I want the men to feel powerful and handsome,” she said.

The Impact
My favorite thing about running a clothing business is making people feel special and beautiful.  While beauty is not a necessity per se, feeling good about oneself is.  In order to get through the day to day rigors, having actual high self esteem, not putting on airs and acting as though you do, is helpful.  Everyone of every age, race, gender and size should be able to feel like a prince or princess.  

I have been in business for eleven years and it has become quite clear that I have focused all of my energy and time on this one thing.  If BC doesn't continue to grow I will have to take several steps back and start all over.  This isn't just a dream that a spooky kid from a small town had 12 years ago anymore.  This is an actual business that not only affect myself, it affects my family, friends, clients, and fans.  If I can pick up steam I can hire employees, which creates jobs, which helps the economy.  If the in-take continues to go up I can afford insurance  so that when I start my family in the next couple of years I can take care of them without any outside help.  I can do even more in my charity work.

It's not only about being self sufficient and staying afloat, it's about contributing to society in a positive way.  


What We Need & What You Get
In the next year I’m going to work towards going into production. Initially I will be presenting my fall collection at shows in Atlanta, then in Madison and Minneapolis. The first goal is transporting my work space outside of my home, the second is creating my fall collection.


As a small business owner I have to rely on the resources I have. Currently I work from home with a few interns. As money comes in it goes right back into the projects. This project would be the way for me to get ahead of the project and keep a continuous flow of work going instead of stopping when the hard spots come.
I live in north Minneapolis, an area affected by a huge tornado earlier this summer.  My studio was flooded and I lost about $500-600 in materials and finished product.  The basement has since been repaired, which took a huge bite out of my finances.  Recently my car's transmission also gave out.  My husband will be going to college 3 hours away for the next two years so I will be the primary earner in the house. Once he leaves I will be renting out my home studio to make ends meet and move my work space outside of the house to up productivity.

My F/W 2011 collection, ""Atlantis Kumarinadu"", is inspired by water, Korean and Chinese garments, organic looking fabrics, Belle Epoque and Art Nouveau style and Ozma from the Oz books.  It will be an intricate and sumptuous collection full of decadent details and fairytale styling.

Immediate Goal (~5000):


Getting a small studio (prepay the first 6 months)
Raise materials cost for F/W 2011 “Atlantis Kumarinadu”
•           fabrics
(batiks, sari fabric, cotton, silk, etc)
•           trims
•           accessories
materials
Build larger cutting table and shelves.

Secondary Goals (~2500):
Get an industrial sewing machine
Get new plus sized mannequin and professional fit size mannequin
Replenish materials lost in the flooding

 


As a reward for believing in my fancy vision, I will give goodies to backers.

with the loss of a close friend or relative could be one of the biggest
challenges we face. The death of a spouse, sibling, parent or child can cause a
particularly deep pain. Overcome this loss takes time, but at some stage can
achieve a renewed sense of purpose and direction in life. To overcome this
situation every day, one strategy is to ensure the safety of loved ones.</span></p><div>

<p></p>
<p>The main
function of Lyon device is useful at all times, since you are born until we
die, in any situation, thanks to its system upgrade through external
accessories. Your current limit is the knowledge barrier because it uses
Android as the base system. One of the considerations that have been taken is
that not everyone has access to the latest technology, but that is solved by
leaving open framework (program to create new applications for Lyon device) to
Lyon device development. Making it possible for all companies and individuals,
pioneering technology or not, can freely develop an accessory for the Lyon device, thus
adapting to the requirements of users and the market as such.</p>
<p>Its simple
design makes it elegant, materials of the highest quality, provides the perfect
finishing touch aesthetic that we like in addition to an estimated more than 10

<p>There are several unmet needs in this area of the market:</p>
<p>First: Constant monitoring of vital signs and provide medical care.</p>
<p>Second: Priority care: patients diagnosed with diseases that require continuous monitoring of vital signs; Identify, prevent and / or mitigate risk factors.</p>
<p>Third: The details of the design are very strict, and product validation environments were controlled by the risk associated with products that interact with people.</p>
<p>Fourth, an important goal of remote monitoring is to decrease the number of patients followed in a hospital. It is noninvasive. Benefit patients and their dependents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lyon main function device:</p>
<p>Constantly take your vital signs, for insertion into an algorithm for detecting cardiac or respiratory abnormalities, wherein the device take care of them know the patient is well, or detected a possible anomaly.</p>
<p>By presenting a situation of abnormality as the device is programmed to a previously contracted warn competent medical authority.</p>
<p>When medical unit arrives to check what is happening with a reader-link technology nfc bluetooth authorized, you can get real-time patient data as follows:</p>

así mayor seguridad a las familias.</p>
<p>La
principal función de Lyon device, es ser útil en todo momento, desde que naces
hasta que mueres, en cualquier situación, gracias a su sistema de actualización
mediante accesorios externos. Su límite actual es la barrera de conocimiento
debido a que usa android como sistema base. Una de las consideraciones que se
han tomado es que, no todos tenemos acceso a la tecnología más reciente, pero
eso se soluciona al dejar abierto el framework (programa para crear nuevas
aplicaciones para Lyon device) de desarrollo para Lyon device. Haciendo posible
que todas las compañías y personas, pioneras o no en tecnología, puedan
desarrollar libremente un accesorio para Lyon device, adaptándose así a los
requerimientos de los usuarios y del mercado como tal. </p>
<p>Su diseño
simple, lo hace elegante, sus materiales de la más alta calidad, le proporciona
ese toque estético de acabado perfecto que tanto nos gusta además de tener una

<p>Segunda: Atención prioritaria: pacientes con diagnóstico de enfermedades que requieren continuo monitoreo de los signos vitales; Identificar, evitar y/o atenuar factores de riesgo.</p>
<p>Tercera: Las precisiones del diseño son muy estrictas, y los ambientes de validación del producto fueron controlados, por el riesgo asociado a productos que interactúan con las personas.</p>
<p>Cuarta: un importante objetivo del monitoreo a distancia es disminuir el número de pacientes en seguimiento en un centro hospitalario. No es invasivo. Beneficiaría a los pacientes y a los familiares a su cargo.</p>
<p>Función principal Lyon device:</p>
<p>Tomará constantemente los signos vitales del paciente, para introducirlo
en un algoritmo de detección de anomalías cardiacas o respiratorias, donde el
dispositivo se encargara de hacerle saber al paciente que está bien, o se ha
detectado una posible anomalía.</p>
<p>Al presentarse una situación de anomalía según este programado el
dispositivo se avisara a una autoridad médica competente previamente
contratada.</p>
<p>Cuando llega la unidad médica, a revisar que es lo que está pasando, con
un lector de tecnología de enlace nfc-bluetooth autorizada, podrá obtener en
tiempo real los siguientes datos del paciente:</p>
<p>1.) Signos vitales.</p>
<p>  1.1.) Pulso.</p>
<p>  1.2.) Oximetría.</p>
<p>  1.3.) Hora.</p>

<p>Ahora, imagina este caso, algo que sucede muy a menudo,
imagina algo trágico, algo por lo que nadie quiere pasar, tu esposa, tu mama,
tu hija, cualquier mujer que ames, va conduciendo y desafortunadamente por un
descuido o un fallo mecánico, tiene un accidente, el carro vuelca, logran
sacarla del vehículo, pero su billetera, queda en la silla de copiloto.</p>

Thanks for viewing my project, it will be something big someday, help spread the word on your social networks please.thank you





Lyon, the first customizable Smart WatchCoping
with the loss of a close friend or relative could be one of the biggest
challenges we face. The death of a spouse, sibling, parent or child can cause a
particularly deep pain. Overcome this loss takes time, but at some stage can
achieve a renewed sense of purpose and direction in life. To overcome this
situation every day, one strategy is to ensure the safety of loved ones.
Lyon
device means security for you and your family, How ?, With its sophisticated  communication
nfc-bluethoot, storage system vital data in emergencies, and
current measurement systems vital signs, gives medical staff authorized, all
information in real time as you need.
In
people who require constant monitoring of vital signs, Lyon device is
programmed to to detect any significant changes in vital signs, and immediately
alert the authorized medical personnel, to thus act as quickly as possible to
stabilize the user and provide and greater security for families.

The main
function of Lyon device is useful at all times, since you are born until we
die, in any situation, thanks to its system upgrade through external
accessories. Your current limit is the knowledge barrier because it uses
Android as the base system. One of the considerations that have been taken is
that not everyone has access to the latest technology, but that is solved by
leaving open framework (program to create new applications for Lyon device) to
Lyon device development. Making it possible for all companies and individuals,
pioneering technology or not, can freely develop an accessory for the Lyon device, thus
adapting to the requirements of users and the market as such.
Its simple
design makes it elegant, materials of the highest quality, provides the perfect
finishing touch aesthetic that we like in addition to an estimated more than 10
years lifespan.



There are several unmet needs in this area of the market:
First: Constant monitoring of vital signs and provide medical care.
Second: Priority care: patients diagnosed with diseases that require continuous monitoring of vital signs; Identify, prevent and / or mitigate risk factors.
Third: The details of the design are very strict, and product validation environments were controlled by the risk associated with products that interact with people.
Fourth, an important goal of remote monitoring is to decrease the number of patients followed in a hospital. It is noninvasive. Benefit patients and their dependents.

Lyon main function device:
Constantly take your vital signs, for insertion into an algorithm for detecting cardiac or respiratory abnormalities, wherein the device take care of them know the patient is well, or detected a possible anomaly.
By presenting a situation of abnormality as the device is programmed to a previously contracted warn competent medical authority.
When medical unit arrives to check what is happening with a reader-link technology nfc bluetooth authorized, you can get real-time patient data as follows:
1.) Vital Signs.
1.1.) Pulse.
1.2.) Oximetry.
1.3.) Time.
1.4.) Alarm incidents.
1.5.) Temperature
2.) Medical History.
2.1.) Name, ID, emergency contact, blood type, problems Coagulation if owned, Drug Allergies, Diseases, Drugs that are consuming, treatments to which they are submitting, Surgeries performed, Allergies in general .
2.2.) Medical history depending on the patient available.
How will it work? and When?
In a checkup, the doctor will update the Device Lyon, according to the results, and are saved in the device memory, to go gradually filling all the basic information of the user.

Now, imagine this case, something that happens very often, imagine something tragic, something that nobody wants to go, your wife, your mother, your daughter, any woman you love, you are driving and unfortunately for carelessness or a mechanical failure has an accident, truck overturns, achieve out of the vehicle, but her wallet is in the passenger seat.


Ask yourself these two scenarios:
1) without lyon device.The medical team who arrives at the emergency, have no idea of her identity or emergency contact number, treatments to which this submitting, allergies, clotting problems, if she is consuming drugs or not, must wait for connecting all medical instruments to monitor vital signs. It is a bit slow and arduous process. And with the desire to save a life, many things can happen. And even more with lack of information about her.

2) with lyon device.

Emergency personnel arrive, Lyon touch the device with an authorized reader nfc, and in the display of this reader, all relevant data will appear:


- Pulse.
- Oximetry.
- Time.
- Name, ID, emergency contact, blood type, problems Coagulation if owned, Drug Allergies, Diseases, Drugs that are consuming, treatments to which they are submitting, Surgeries performed, Allergies in general .
they have all the information they need and her signs in real time, with just a touch.


3) Plus its accessories (years old):



3.1)
Persons who require constant monitoring of vital signs, prevention and
monitoring. To imply that the product provides a constant assurance regarding
the health of the user. (50 -....).
3.2) With
the office accessory can be monitored from the wrist: calendar, emails, updates
united people, have access to the cloud, and all android market applications
supported, so that each device is Lyon sole. Without losing the security
provided regarding health. (40-50)





3.3.) With
the accessory undertake, you can see the latest updates regarding trends,
recent business statistics, aid programs employer, job boards and classifieds,
listings of banks with the lowest interest rates, and everything that android
market offers. (30-40).
3.4.) You
will support andriod allowing the use of all applications developed for the
same, serving as entertainment, information, study, job listings, access to
files in the cloud, fitness, social networks, etc. (20-30)
3.5.)
Multimedia. Based on your operating system, device Lyon has many applications
focused on entertainment and leisure, but thanks to an agreement with a company
in Bogota Parquesoft who provide us with resources in this area to change not
left alone here may also have educational software of them free publicity.
(10-20)

3.6.) A
device which will allow issuing alarms prevention when the user is in areas of
concern will be taken, there will also be a device with microphone and speaker

your vital signs.
Lyon Device Sport


A small description

For everyone:









My story:
this is me:



He was my father:


He suffered a disease called ALS
The day he died, a device as lyon had given me one maybe two more days with him, is more a few more minutes to say goodbye, I would be happy with it, but fate is cruel, at first glance looked like a day like any other, but his body, according to medical staff wearing failing for hours, something we could not detect, so that day I started to design what took me a couple of years: Lyon, efficient and economical device useful for these cases, especially for low-income families like mine, I come to you to ask for funds and so to develop my project and maybe someday, my goal that every person in the world carries a Lyon for your safety and peace of your family can be made it is the hardest blow of my life, not to say some last words to my father, because the instruments to monitor their vital signs are very expensive. We lost the course of technology, which initially was to facilitate and make life safer, now just luxury and capitalism. Help me change a little this, contribute a bit to this cause, with your support will do my greatest effort to provide security to the families of the world.

Sobrellevar la pérdida de un amigo cercano o un familiar podría ser uno
de los mayores retos que podemos enfrentar. La muerte de la pareja, un hermano,
un padre o un hijo puede causar un dolor especialmente profundo. Superar esta
pérdida toma tiempo, pero en alguna etapa se puede alcanzar un renovado sentido
de propósito y dirección en la vida. Para superar cada día esta situación, una
estrategia es velar por la seguridad de los seres queridos.  
Lyon
device significa seguridad para ti y tu familia, ¿Cómo?, Gracias a su
comunicación nfc-bluethoot,  su
sofisticado sistema de almacenamiento de datos vitales en casos de emergencia,
y sus sistemas de medición de signos vitales actuales, le brinda al personal
médico autorizado, toda la información en tiempo real que necesite.  
En
personas que requieran monitoreo constante de sus signos vitales, Lyon device está
programado para al detectar cualquier cambio significativo en sus signos
vitales, y alertar inmediatamente al personal médico autorizado, para que de
esta manera actúen lo más rápido posible para estabilizar al usuario y brindar
así mayor seguridad a las familias.
La
principal función de Lyon device, es ser útil en todo momento, desde que naces
hasta que mueres, en cualquier situación, gracias a su sistema de actualización
mediante accesorios externos. Su límite actual es la barrera de conocimiento
debido a que usa android como sistema base. Una de las consideraciones que se
han tomado es que, no todos tenemos acceso a la tecnología más reciente, pero
eso se soluciona al dejar abierto el framework (programa para crear nuevas
aplicaciones para Lyon device) de desarrollo para Lyon device. Haciendo posible
que todas las compañías y personas, pioneras o no en tecnología, puedan
desarrollar libremente un accesorio para Lyon device, adaptándose así a los
requerimientos de los usuarios y del mercado como tal. 
Su diseño
simple, lo hace elegante, sus materiales de la más alta calidad, le proporciona
ese toque estético de acabado perfecto que tanto nos gusta además de tener una
vida útil estimada de mas de 10 años.
Hay varias necesidades por satisfacer en este ámbito del mercado:
Primera: Monitoreo constante de los signos vitales y facilitar la asistencia médica. 
Segunda: Atención prioritaria: pacientes con diagnóstico de enfermedades que requieren continuo monitoreo de los signos vitales; Identificar, evitar y/o atenuar factores de riesgo.
Tercera: Las precisiones del diseño son muy estrictas, y los ambientes de validación del producto fueron controlados, por el riesgo asociado a productos que interactúan con las personas.
Cuarta: un importante objetivo del monitoreo a distancia es disminuir el número de pacientes en seguimiento en un centro hospitalario. No es invasivo. Beneficiaría a los pacientes y a los familiares a su cargo.
Función principal Lyon device:
Tomará constantemente los signos vitales del paciente, para introducirlo
en un algoritmo de detección de anomalías cardiacas o respiratorias, donde el
dispositivo se encargara de hacerle saber al paciente que está bien, o se ha
detectado una posible anomalía.
Al presentarse una situación de anomalía según este programado el
dispositivo se avisara a una autoridad médica competente previamente
contratada.
Cuando llega la unidad médica, a revisar que es lo que está pasando, con
un lector de tecnología de enlace nfc-bluetooth autorizada, podrá obtener en
tiempo real los siguientes datos del paciente:
1.) Signos vitales.
  1.1.) Pulso.
  1.2.) Oximetría.
  1.3.) Hora.
  1.4.) Alarma de
incidentes.
  1.5.) Temperatura
2.) Historial Médico.
  2.1.) Nombre, Identificación,
Contacto de emergencia, Tipo de sangre, problemas de Coagulación si es que se
poseen, Alergias a medicamentos, Enfermedades, Medicamentos que se estén
consumiendo, Tratamientos a los cuales se está sometiendo, Cirugías realizadas,
Alergias en general.
2.2.) Historias
Clínicas por categoría según el paciente disponga.
Como funciona? y cuando?
En un control médico, el doctor, va a actualizar el Lyon
Device, según los resultados, y se van guardando en la memoria del dispositivo,
para ir completando poco a poco toda la información básica del usuario.
Ahora, imagina este caso, algo que sucede muy a menudo,
imagina algo trágico, algo por lo que nadie quiere pasar, tu esposa, tu mama,
tu hija, cualquier mujer que ames, va conduciendo y desafortunadamente por un
descuido o un fallo mecánico, tiene un accidente, el carro vuelca, logran
sacarla del vehículo, pero su billetera, queda en la silla de copiloto.
Plantéate estos dos escenarios:
1) Sin lyon device.
No tienen ni idea de su identidad, ni numero de contacto
de emergencia, tratamientos a los cuales se este sometiendo, alergias,
 problemas de
coagulacion, medicamentos que ella esta consumiendo, deben esperar a conectar
todo el instrumental medico para monitorear sus signos vitales.
Es un proceso algo lento y arduo. Y con el afan de salvar
una vida, pueden suceder muchas cosas. Y mas aun con falta de informacion
acerca de ella.
2) Con lyon device.
Llega el personal de emergencias, tocas el dispositivo Lyon
con un lector de nfc autorizado, y en la pantalla de este lector, aparecerán
todos los datos competentes:
- Pulso.
- Oximetría.
- Tiempo.
- Nombre, ID, contactos de emergencia, tipo de sangre,
problemas de coagulación en caso de propiedad, Alergias a medicamentos,
enfermedades, drogas que consumen, los tratamientos a los que se están
presentando, cirugías realizadas, alergias en general.
Ellos tienen todos los datos que necesitan y sus signos en
tiempo real, con tan solo un toque.
3) Ademas de sus accesorios: (Edad) 3.1.) Personas que
requieren un Monitoreo constante de sus signos vitales: prevención y supervisión. Dar a entender que el producto brinda
una seguridad constante en cuanto a la salud del usuario. (50-....).
3.2.) Con el
accesorio de oficina se podrá monitorear desde la muñeca: la agenda, los
correos, las actualizaciones de estados de las personas, tendrá acceso a la
nube, y a todas las aplicaciones de android market soportadas, para que cada Lyon
device sea único.  Sin perder la seguridad que brinda en cuanto a la salud.
(40-50)

3.3.) Con el accesorio emprender, se podrán ver las últimas
actualizaciones en cuanto a  tendencias,
estadísticas empresariales recientes, programas de ayuda al empresario, bolsas
de empleo y anuncios clasificados, listados de bancos con las tasas más bajas
de intereses, y todo lo que android market ofrece. (30-40).
3.4.) Tendrá
compatibilidad con andriod lo que permite la utilización de todas las
aplicaciones desarrolladas para ese mismo, prestando servicios como
entretenimiento, información de estudio, listas de trabajo, acceso a archivos
en la nube, fitness, redes sociales, etc. (20-30)
3.5.) Multimedia. Partiendo de su sistema operativo, Lyon device cuenta
con innumerables aplicaciones enfocadas al entretenimiento y ocio, pero no se
queda solo acá también puede tener software educativo, gracias a un convenio
con una empresa en parquesoft Bogota quienes nos proveerán de recursos en esta
área a cambio de hacerles publicidad gratuita. 
(10-20)

dispositivo el cual permitirá emitir alarmas de prevención cuando el usuario se
encuentre en zonas de posible riesgo, también habrá un dispositivo con
micrófono y un parlante para que siempre escuches al bebé, y cuando crezca será
un buen recurso para un mayor acompañamiento paternal. (0-10)

We're an independent brand & design studio based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We produce collection of leather bag, briefcase and upscale accessories with the finest quality workmanship & materials.

What we do for people:



Quality: Finest leather & exceptional craftsmanship.


Fair Price: We work directly with our manufacturer to cut out all the middlemen, PR firms, so we’re able to offer our bags at a great value.


Design: Unique is the result from sense of minimalist. Your satisfaction is our final goal. 





Our approach



We have designing our collection, searching for the suitable leather and hardware since last year. Now we have received final prototypes and ready to start production. With your help to meet the minimum order quantity ($25,000) for our custom leather from the tannery and begin production.


We are offering our very first collection at almost 40% discount to our Indiegogo supporters. Please note: Duffel bag, and briefcase come with an adjustable, leather shoulder strap (up to 50 inches).















The Project


Like how other did: with the vision of producing high quality and reasonably priced leather products by cutting out the middleman.  
We aims to create this collection that's in keeping with our design identity; simple understated styling, classic looks, durable yet practical.  





Material / Production


We will deal directly with every supplier ourselves to minimize all the risks could happen like delays in materials and production. With the help of Indiegogo community, we hope we will make this project success.


We will keep you updated about the production; communicate frequently and openly with you, so please support this project with confidence.

Fitness centers have to face such arguments as:




As we know, it is not weird, because weight reduction is a process that involves physical activity that - putting it into simple terms - burning fat and building muscles.



Next comes our favorite question:





Usually, the client says:

If the clients carried a measuring tape, they would
be able to check their measurements and verify that everything is proceeding
successfully as planned. Of course, it is rather inconvenient to carry a
measuring tape around in your pocket or handbag.



For this purpose, we have created the MotivationBelt®, which has on its inner side a scale, booth in centimeters and inches, so that clients may comfortably follow how their waist size is diminishing day after day.












                      


Daily feedback (visual check of the size of their waistline) reminds clients of their objective, namely, their desire to lose weight.

</div></div>","We know your days are full of activities, and that every day is a completely different story. Your activities change, your needs change; and, through time, even you change. Your backpack always comes along with you, but it isn't ready to keep up with your changing needs and tastes.

That's why you need your own TOK.

TOK is a versatile backpack created with a unique assembly system, that allows you to easily add and remove additional components. [Patent pending]                  
TOKs are designed to fit your basic needs:    

               1.  TOK Large Component if you need an extra set of clothes to work out.                2. TOK Small Component if you need to carry your lunch for a long day.






               








After months of research and thousands of sketches, we came up with the best design you could imagine.  It doesn't matter what you do, your TOK will be there with you!

                    

[All the components were carefully designed to be securely attached to the Basic TOK.]








   
Some TOK components can be used individually!




The best thing is that you can mix and match your TOK to make it unique, just like you! You can even change your TOK depending on how you feel everyday!











No more having to buy different backpacks for different activities.
No more changing your whole backpack just because one tiny part of it is ripped.
No more having the same old, boring backpack every single day.
No more carrying a big backpack full of stuff you don’t need










We are seven Costa Rican students that dream of making TOK a reality. We need at least $15.000 to make this project come true. Even a single dollar can make a significant difference!



*Does not include the money that we will invest on your perks.






We know the impact that we can have on education. That’s why getting involved with schools is so important for us, even during our early stages. 

We want our products to help students go through every single activity that they have in a better and easier way. If you help us reach our goals, we will be able to donate TOKs to a local school called Escuela Mauro Fernández.
Education has always been a key for progress here in Costa Rica. We want to start making a difference in education right now. 









Your contribution is greatly appreciated. And you can also help us go viral! 
                                                                                                                                                     


                                                          TOK FACEBOOK PAGE

<h2><strong>What about Vegas Sunglasses?</strong></h2>
<p>Vegas are colored and extravagant sunglasses characterized by a unique composition of images taken from our collections: each pair follows a topic, each pair transmits emotion.</p>
<p>Vagas Sunglasses come from the idea that the a<strong>ccessory makes the difference:</strong> it has to convey our attitude, to <strong>represent our mood</strong>, give off our feelings so, when we define our look we should find the inner meaning of what we wear.  </p>
<p>Vegas Sunglasses is a <strong>high quality, made in Italy, trendy product</strong>  that, despite of the handmade process of creating, keeps an <strong>affordable price</strong>.</p>

<p>We are a group of friends, guys and girls, collectors of vinyl, comics, fashion newspaper clippings, vintage postcard. We always knew that we would have done something with this material .. but what?</p>
<p>One day we thought <em>&lt;&lt; why not share our collection, giving the opportunity to those who want to own a little piece of it ?&gt;&gt;</em></p>
<p>A year ago we went to Italy to visite a dear friend, head of a little workshop in Venice in which he produces beautiful hand made decorated eyeglasses. <br/>We were impressed by that unique team of skilled artisans, working hard and carrying out their work with passion and accuracy in order to create truly unique pieces and we thought that we’d liked to work with them.<br/>Our idea was born from this meeting: properly combining all our clippings it’s possible to synthesize a concept, express a passion for a particular art movement or a musical trend, so we thought that all this could be conveyed not only, as usual, in a common t-shirt, but in a pair of sunglasses.</p>

<h2><strong>The process of creating</strong></h2>
<p>The process of creating of each pair of glasses includes a careful analysis of the repertoire of available images, a continuous research of new sources and a detailed assemblage, following  color and theme’s criteria. After many attempts,  using the best printing and fixing techniques, we have found an almost craftsmanship production process that allows us to obtain an high quality product. The images are chosen one by one with care, put together with skill and knowledge to create a jigsaw portraying our passions, our feelings.</p>

Do you know  ICAF - The International Child Art Foundation? It is a non profit organization whose objectives are to cultivate children’s imagination, reduce violence, and remediate suffering. The ICAF fosters children’s creativity and develops their empathy arranging exhibitions across the U.S. and around the world.

“Believe in what you think, see, imagine and feel.
Use your imagination and look at the world.
Be looking for ideas all the time, anywhere you go.
Look at the world with an open mind.
…
You can be creative but it takes hard work.
Put your mind to whatever you want to do.
Keep practicing.
Set goals; research your thoughts; use your brain.”
 
We share these thoughts. Don’t you?

<h3>Beauty is Pain, No Longer...</h3>
<p>Ask any woman you know, wearing necklaces with long hair can be a *PAIN IN THE NECK*. Some women have come up with their own ways of dealing with this but until now there has never been a product designed to specifically tackle this problem. In 2005 I was disucssing this problem with my friend when the idea struck me. If we are all having this problem, lets find a solution... Life happened and the idea sat in the cobwebs of my brain for years. In 2010 after losing my job as a bank teller, I was ready to begin the journey of sharing my idea with the world. The process started with me making protoypes with a variety of materials and designs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Very quickly I realized I needed help and Kevin, an engineer friend, held my hand and together we refined the design to what it is today. It has now been two years of designing, testing, &amp; redesigning. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Up to this point Calipz has been completely self funded. I've poured my life's saving, imposed on friends and family for investments, and called in every last favor. It's a win-win by helping one woman (that's me) and solves a problem for all women. We're not curing cancer here but this seeminly small problem carries some big burdens. Some necklace clasps are more violent offenders than others but no matter how much hair they claim the results are always the same: painful, hair splitting, and heartbreaking. You want to wear that gorgeous necklace that your boyfriend got you but <em>EVERY</em> time you wear it you're ripping hair out. Grandma gave you her beautiful pendant necklace but from all the times you've pulled hair out the clasp is broken.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Packaging"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://files.calipz.com/v1/Calipz_Pkg_2Open-Web.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Packaging""/></p>
<h3>All In</h3>
<p> I've spent the last two years on a crash course in manufacturing, design, and distribution. Join me in this journey and help your sisters, mothers, wives, and yourselves keep those necklaces in check.</p>
<p>Your contributions will be used to produce our first mass production and packaging. Calipz - Necklasps are made using injection molding; take a large steel (custom) mold, inject silicone into hundreds of cavities, and Voila! Calipz is born.</p>
</div>

<p>Production:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5,000: tooling (big steel mold)</li>
<li>$2,500: labor and materials</li>
<li>$3,700: packaging and custom design (3-packs + shipper of six 3-packs) </li>
<li>$800: operating expenses such as shipping and marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>If the goal is not met you'll still get your Calipz. It may be a prototype (not one of my shrink wrap prortypes - dont worry) and it may arrive in a ziploce bag (not really) but you'll have a unique part of our history. </p>

<p>For the men reading this think of the painstaking effort that you spend picking out just the right necklace to give the woman in your life. You dont's want that time spent in vain. Make sure she can and will wear it without worrying.</p>
<p>Be the first to get in on this emerging trend! We plan to offer silver and gold, glitter, colors, and differnet sizes in the near future. You'll be the first to never again have your hair eaten by your necklace. Guys, be the knight in shingin armor to give the gift of worry free accessories.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">About Us</span><br/>
</h3><p><span>The REVEER team is composed of undergraduate students from the University of Ottawa and we are committed to providing accessories that are ethically made and environmentally friendly. As students and young professionals, we were tired of regularly purchasing an average backpack!  So we came together to create a unique backpack that can be used by the everyday student and young professional.  The REVEER backpack is minimalistic yet stylishly functional!</span></p><div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456947297/lhhyhojmidvyw8iyykbi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>REVEER bags are unique in that they are <b>durable,</b> <b>handmade</b>, <b>ethically sourced</b>, <b>recycled</b> and <b>locally sourced</b>. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Durable</b> because jute has high tensile strength - enough to carry up to 150 pounds of coffee beans! </p></li>
<li><p>Each bag is <b>handmade</b> by talented artisans who take considerable attention to detail, creativity, and care to ensure that it is constructed to last.</p></li>
<li><p>It is <b>ethically sourced</b> as Canadian immigrant women are employed to make these wonderful bags. </p></li>
<li><p>Our bags are made with <b>recycled</b> fabrics, which decreases textile waste in Canada.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, they are <b>locally sourced</b> as all manufacturing and fabrics used for the bags are found at home, in Canada.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to fund and ensure the sustainability of this project, our team needs to raise at least $3000. This money will go towards:</p>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">creating new product lines,</span></li>
<li>and giving more women employment opportunities for a fair and liveable wage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since our whole team comes from families who have immigrated or took refuge in Canada, we wanted to find a way to help these newcomers through our product. We have all grown to love this country, but we have noticed a substantial growing issue: the unemployment rate for newcomers and lack of opportunities for immigrant and refugee women in the Canadian workforce.</p>
<p>REVEER gives these women the opportunity to obtain employable skills and credentials for future development through our online boutique, which is dedicated to hiring unemployed and marginalized immigrant and refugee women to work and acquire skills in the textile and fashion industry.

</div></div>","About Us
The REVEER team is composed of undergraduate students from the University of Ottawa and we are committed to providing accessories that are ethically made and environmentally friendly. As students and young professionals, we were tired of regularly purchasing an average backpack!  So we came together to create a unique backpack that can be used by the everyday student and young professional.  The REVEER backpack is minimalistic yet stylishly functional!



REVEER bags are unique in that they are durable, handmade, ethically sourced, recycled and locally sourced. 

Durable because jute has high tensile strength - enough to carry up to 150 pounds of coffee beans! 
Each bag is handmade by talented artisans who take considerable attention to detail, creativity, and care to ensure that it is constructed to last.
It is ethically sourced as Canadian immigrant women are employed to make these wonderful bags. 
Our bags are made with recycled fabrics, which decreases textile waste in Canada.
Finally, they are locally sourced as all manufacturing and fabrics used for the bags are found at home, in Canada.

What We Need & What You Get
In order to fund and ensure the sustainability of this project, our team needs to raise at least $3000. This money will go towards:


building our inventory,
creating new product lines,
and giving more women employment opportunities for a fair and liveable wage.

If we exceed our goal, this will allow us to employ more women, introduce more product lines, and ultimately collaborate with various organizations in order to find further opportunities for empowerment. 

Perks


We've made giving a bit easier for you! Here are five different options to choose from that come as perks when making contributions:





If we do not reach our entire funding goal, the amount raised will continue to go towards producing the backpacks.
The Impact
Our two primary goals are: 

1) To empower women by creating valuable work experience and providing resources for career advancement.
2) To divert as much textile waste away from landfills as we possibly can! 


Since our whole team comes from families who have immigrated or took refuge in Canada, we wanted to find a way to help these newcomers through our product. We have all grown to love this country, but we have noticed a substantial growing issue: the unemployment rate for newcomers and lack of opportunities for immigrant and refugee women in the Canadian workforce.
REVEER gives these women the opportunity to obtain employable skills and credentials for future development through our online boutique, which is dedicated to hiring unemployed and marginalized immigrant and refugee women to work and acquire skills in the textile and fashion industry. One of our many goals is to ensure these women earn and maintain a sustainable income, living wage, and increase their skills for future employment.
We also wanted to tackle textile waste! 

Our bags are made using recycled coffee bags from local coffee roasters, and as a result- no two REVEER backpacks are exactly the same! 
 
Once we are established in Ottawa, we hope to reach out to other organizations nation-wide in order to help provide additional employment opportunities to empower women, and find additional ways to divert textile waste. 
Special thanks to the Walmart Foundation for their financial contribution that helped us launch our initiative!

I am setting up a store on SnapDeal and I am expecting that this way I will be able to get more customers who believe in my work and judge me on the basis of merits not on my outlook.

This could happen because you have supported me in raising more than 25000 USD (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/chhanv-s-closet-acid-attack-fighter-rupa-s-dream/x/2804909#/story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">see the campaign</a>) and I started learning fashion designing under the mentorship of one of the campaigner of SAA, Atul. At present I stay in Chhanv and sell my designs at SheRoes. This was the first time I have presented my clothes and I am glad to see them being appreciated. Many of my dresses are being loved by the tourists who come to India on a visit Taj Mahal. The increase in demand for my creations at SheRoes is expanding my business in to the commercial market space. Friends who visit us in Agra want to be able to buy products the same day and are not prepared to wait for a long period of time even for a piece of bespoke wear. I continue to receive numerous emails asking for my stockiest and how people can purchase my garments online. I want to fulfill the demand for my product and let the customer access the designs with ease.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439674423/ozochn9sbi3sgoabv0fs.png"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started up this crowd funding campaign in the hopes to help achieve the completion of my first full collection on my own store &amp; also on India’s biggest online store SnapDeal.com. <br/>
</p><p>At the moment I'm delved in the process of creating my biggest and excitedly awaited first full featured collection to be aimed at SnapDeal.Com.

Also, my work will get better visibility and market as Online clothes shopping is a good alternative to actually going into the department store. <br/></p><h2>Why an Online Store is the need of hour?</h2>
<p>Using the Internet as my primary sales channel offers multiple advantages.<br/>
<br/>
1) By going online, suddenly an Agra cafe or a small boutique inside that cafe expands its reach to a national, or even international base of potential buyers. During my last Indiegogo campaign, I realized that web-based sales know no international boundaries.</p>
<p>2) Building a website is cheaper than opening a store, and I can reach customers online anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>3) Shopping is easy and comfortable for customers who can not go to Agra.<br/><br/>
4) It's a social world out there, with friends turning to social media such as Facebook and Twitter to connect with the cause and the community work by our campaigners. Even, we know each other on social media/internet) and the only way to connect with friends like you is ‘having online presence’. My Online store will also give you the chance to browse for diverse designs at the same time, providing you with my wide range of designs to select from.<br/><br/>
5) There are recommendation features on Internet clothes shops and I am hopeful that I will receive more recommendations online. </p>

</p><h1><b>MY STORY</b></h1>
<p>
</p><p>Hi! My name is Rupa, and I’m an 21-year-old acid attack survivor, now turning into an entrepreneur. For me, a dream to be a designer seemed far-fetched at one time. But Instead of hiding my scarred face behind a scarf, I go public and started living for my dream: a fashion designer. I always hung onto my dream but I never knew that one day it would be possible and I would be launching my own label. As a child I wanted to design clothes for young Indian woman, but by the acid attack I was unsure and lost my courage. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439675475/mathyrrnexukisi8trsq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>I was 15, when my stepmother, who was unwilling to pay my marriage expenses, entered the bedroom at night. While I slept she poured acid over my face. The wedding was called off. My father refused to let me provide medical, if I would ever advert his new wife. But I however took the bold step and went to the police. My uncle supported me. My stepmother spent only 18 months in jail &amp; now she is free on parole. The contact to my father was aborted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For six years, I am fighting against pain and social exclusion. So far I had to go through more than 10 surgical operations. Immediately after the attack I moved from my home village to my uncles place in NCR (National Capital Region) and lived in a new family. At present I am a team member of Chhanv Foundation and staying at Chhanv in Agra. Together with the team of “Stop acid attacks” I works for hundreds of other survivors in India.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439686399/tszsjitjlpsrcfsfoibq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I am not alone with horror injuries. Exact figures for India do not exist, because acid attacks, earlier, were not punishable as a separate offense. With acid mostly young girls or women are mutilated and disfigured. Some victims go blind or acid etched up through the bone – with deadly consequences. Reasons for the mutilation are jealousy, insults or revenge. There are already numerous cases of young women, who rejected a marriage proposal and being then mutilated from the man!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440118957/a6xa0obvk7vibelobp7v.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440118979/k4zy4t5dddry2xxshsyj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440119137/mjnopeghmbeas5dpqec2.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440119159/mplcyqqx4yhimhgtyzlg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I created SheRoes Collection as a safe haven to escape to when everyone in the world seemed to have abandoned me. It was there where I sort comfort in creations from my own imagination to give purpose and make sense of the darkness that had unforgivably fallen upon my mental state of wellbeing. Eventually attacked in my teen age and plagued with numerous emotional breakdowns, my confidence was completely lost. I was subjected to harsh cruelty that left me in a very dark place. It was only then at my lowest point when I started searching for a hope in my life. I met some great people who have faced similar violences against them and, later, they have become my inspiration. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439676180/tdnaeofrjblooxjjlfsx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Apart from showing off the clothes, I want to change the way people perceive beauty (Like this <a href=""http://www.hindustantimes.com/photos/punjab/july42015/Article4-1365938.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">experiment</a>). By creating this collection and unleashing it upon the world, it will allow me to lay bare my scars and release all the hatred that has shrouded my life for so long, turning something truly ugly into a work of beautiful artistic expression. I want to tell people to look beyond the surface, to tell them that beauty is really within a person. I’m hoping you’ll help me spread the word about how we can change the world through fashion with these really cool dresses I designed!<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439678684/xeiqnhtyaxup1qsgqbeh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><span><span>First time in India's history when acid attack survivors were the

</p><p>Rupa, Ritu, Neetu., Geeta and Dolly. Five acid attack survivors, five incredible stories of lives shattered, but refusing to break. Of unimaginable pain and an indomitable spirit. All five are proud workers at Sheroes’ Hangout in Agra, the labour of love and commitment of a campaign that has a sole motive: Stop Acid Attacks. </p>
<p><span>At Sheroes, the ideas of beauty and importance of appearance are often the talking point. There is a readers’ cafe, an activism workshop, a designer boutique and an exhibit space, where works crafted by survivors are displayed.

<h2><span>Why I need you support? </span></h2>
<p>
</p><p>I find it a bit important asking for help because I know that my project won't be as successful without it. We have gone through our plans and 3000 USD will help with buying the first round of fabric, buy labels, few machines,  get some of the dresses and accessories made). The money we are raising will help cover our production costs, material costs, travel costs, website set-up costs, design work, marketing, and sales costs. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439679359/vwit1s72p4irlkjxw0ho.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the major issues I’m facing at the moment is time, being able to clear time to make the designs for this collection and giving time for collaborators to craft selected components that I may not otherwise be able to do myself. As I am only one self-employed person who runs my whole business 24/7 I have to stretch out to keep on top of everything else allocating segments of time towards each project. <br/></p><h1>
Budget </h1><p></p>
<p><b>WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE FUNDS?</b> </p>
<p>
</p><p>The funds will first be used towards material for the dresses, production, labels, trade shows, marketing and everything we need to get the production done and the product in the hands of customers. Once we reach our goal, we are going to grow SheRoes Collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ll also be looking to hire a videographer to help create an artistic short fashion video to help bring my creations to life and have as an introduction to the collection before coming out on the catwalks. There will also be photography done too for promotional and advertisement purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve already planned and am looking ahead in researching costs for services and have been given quotes from various collaborators to help give me an idea on how to allocate funding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the key components the funding will be put towards include,</p>
<p>
</p><p></p>
<h4>Operation Expenses: 1500 USD<br/>
</h4><h4>- Extensive fabric resourcing<br/>
</h4><h4>- Studio time, pattern drafting, designing<br/>- Tailoring: Cutting, Sewing and sampling<br/>- Manufacturing and maintenance of product<br/>- Transportation Costs <br/>- Logistics and back-office expenses </h4>

Since last year I've slowly started to venture more into clothing design while dabbling in my artistry talents. At the moment I'm delved in the process of creating my biggest and excitedly awaited first full featured collection to be aimed at SnapDeal.Com. I am setting up a store on SnapDeal and I am expecting that this way I will be able to get more customers who believe in my work and judge me on the basis of merits not on my outlook. Also, my work will get better attention and market as Online clothes shopping is a good alternative to actually going into the department store. At present I run my boutique at SheRoes Hangout in Agra, India where I happily work with my fellow acid attack survivors friends. This could happen because you have supported me in raising more than 25000 USD (see the campaign) and I started learning fashion designing under the mentorship of one of the campaigner of SAA, Atul. At present I stay in Chhanv and sell my designs at SheRoes. This was the first time I have presented my clothes and I am glad to see them being appreciated. Many of my dresses are being loved by the tourists who come to India on a visit Taj Mahal. The increase in demand for my creations at SheRoes is expanding my business in to the commercial market space. Friends who visit us in Agra want to be able to buy products the same day and are not prepared to wait for a long period of time even for a piece of bespoke wear. I continue to receive numerous emails asking for my stockiest and how people can purchase my garments online. I want to fulfill the demand for my product and let the customer access the designs with ease. 

I've started up this crowd funding campaign in the hopes to help achieve the completion of my first full collection on my own store & also on India’s biggest online store SnapDeal.com. 
At the moment I'm delved in the process of creating my biggest and excitedly awaited first full featured collection to be aimed at SnapDeal.Com. I am setting up an online store and reselling at SnapDeal. I am expecting that this way I will be able to acquire more customers who believe in my work and judge me on the basis of competence not on my outward appearance. Also, my work will get better visibility and market as Online clothes shopping is a good alternative to actually going into the department store. Why an Online Store is the need of hour?
Using the Internet as my primary sales channel offers multiple advantages.

1) By going online, suddenly an Agra cafe or a small boutique inside that cafe expands its reach to a national, or even international base of potential buyers. During my last Indiegogo campaign, I realized that web-based sales know no international boundaries.
2) Building a website is cheaper than opening a store, and I can reach customers online anywhere in the world. 
3) Shopping is easy and comfortable for customers who can not go to Agra.
4) It's a social world out there, with friends turning to social media such as Facebook and Twitter to connect with the cause and the community work by our campaigners. Even, we know each other on social media/internet) and the only way to connect with friends like you is ‘having online presence’. My Online store will also give you the chance to browse for diverse designs at the same time, providing you with my wide range of designs to select from.
5) There are recommendation features on Internet clothes shops and I am hopeful that I will receive more recommendations online. 

MY STORY

Hi! My name is Rupa, and I’m an 21-year-old acid attack survivor, now turning into an entrepreneur. For me, a dream to be a designer seemed far-fetched at one time. But Instead of hiding my scarred face behind a scarf, I go public and started living for my dream: a fashion designer. I always hung onto my dream but I never knew that one day it would be possible and I would be launching my own label. As a child I wanted to design clothes for young Indian woman, but by the acid attack I was unsure and lost my courage. I was 15, when my stepmother, who was unwilling to pay my marriage expenses, entered the bedroom at night. While I slept she poured acid over my face. The wedding was called off. My father refused to let me provide medical, if I would ever advert his new wife. But I however took the bold step and went to the police. My uncle supported me. My stepmother spent only 18 months in jail & now she is free on parole. The contact to my father was aborted.

For six years, I am fighting against pain and social exclusion. So far I had to go through more than 10 surgical operations. Immediately after the attack I moved from my home village to my uncles place in NCR (National Capital Region) and lived in a new family. At present I am a team member of Chhanv Foundation and staying at Chhanv in Agra. Together with the team of “Stop acid attacks” I works for hundreds of other survivors in India.I am not alone with horror injuries. Exact figures for India do not exist, because acid attacks, earlier, were not punishable as a separate offense. With acid mostly young girls or women are mutilated and disfigured. Some victims go blind or acid etched up through the bone – with deadly consequences. Reasons for the mutilation are jealousy, insults or revenge. There are already numerous cases of young women, who rejected a marriage proposal and being then mutilated from the man!I created SheRoes Collection as a safe haven to escape to when everyone in the world seemed to have abandoned me. It was there where I sort comfort in creations from my own imagination to give purpose and make sense of the darkness that had unforgivably fallen upon my mental state of wellbeing. Eventually attacked in my teen age and plagued with numerous emotional breakdowns, my confidence was completely lost. I was subjected to harsh cruelty that left me in a very dark place. It was only then at my lowest point when I started searching for a hope in my life. I met some great people who have faced similar violences against them and, later, they have become my inspiration. 
Apart from showing off the clothes, I want to change the way people perceive beauty (Like this experiment). By creating this collection and unleashing it upon the world, it will allow me to lay bare my scars and release all the hatred that has shrouded my life for so long, turning something truly ugly into a work of beautiful artistic expression. I want to tell people to look beyond the surface, to tell them that beauty is really within a person. I’m hoping you’ll help me spread the word about how we can change the world through fashion with these really cool dresses I designed!First time in India's history when acid attack survivors were the 
show models & show stoppers modeling for my designsSheRoes Hangout The Sheroes’ Hangout in Agra, a unique Crowd Funded concept initiated by the SAA campaigners, is a heartwarming story of the significant transformation that is taking place in the lives of these young girls and those responsible for putting it together.

Rupa, Ritu, Neetu., Geeta and Dolly. Five acid attack survivors, five incredible stories of lives shattered, but refusing to break. Of unimaginable pain and an indomitable spirit. All five are proud workers at Sheroes’ Hangout in Agra, the labour of love and commitment of a campaign that has a sole motive: Stop Acid Attacks. 
At Sheroes, the ideas of beauty and importance of appearance are often the talking point. There is a readers’ cafe, an activism workshop, a designer boutique and an exhibit space, where works crafted by survivors are displayed. The cafe serves food and beverages, but the menu card has no price list. You pay as much as you want.
Why I need you support? 

I find it a bit important asking for help because I know that my project won't be as successful without it. We have gone through our plans and 3000 USD will help with buying the first round of fabric, buy labels, few machines,  get some of the dresses and accessories made). The money we are raising will help cover our production costs, material costs, travel costs, website set-up costs, design work, marketing, and sales costs. 

One of the major issues I’m facing at the moment is time, being able to clear time to make the designs for this collection and giving time for collaborators to craft selected components that I may not otherwise be able to do myself. As I am only one self-employed person who runs my whole business 24/7 I have to stretch out to keep on top of everything else allocating segments of time towards each project. 
Budget 
WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE FUNDS? 

The funds will first be used towards material for the dresses, production, labels, trade shows, marketing and everything we need to get the production done and the product in the hands of customers. Once we reach our goal, we are going to grow SheRoes Collection.

I’ll also be looking to hire a videographer to help create an artistic short fashion video to help bring my creations to life and have as an introduction to the collection before coming out on the catwalks. There will also be photography done too for promotional and advertisement purposes.

I’ve already planned and am looking ahead in researching costs for services and have been given quotes from various collaborators to help give me an idea on how to allocate funding.

Some of the key components the funding will be put towards include,


Operation Expenses: 1500 USD
- Extensive fabric resourcing
- Studio time, pattern drafting, designing- Tailoring: Cutting, Sewing and sampling- Manufacturing and maintenance of product- Transportation Costs - Logistics and back-office expenses 

Capital Expenses: 1000 USD

- New equipments and machines- A computer for the billing process- E-commerce development
Contribution Expenses: 500 USD- Printing Ad Materials- Research- Content Writing- Model Photo shoot- Digital Media Marketing
Personnel Expenses: 1000 USD- Executive Director- Counselling Director- Designing Mentor- At least 5 tailors/workmen- E-commerce content developer- Photographers and Models (In-Aid Contributions)








Your help will help us promote the SheRoes Collection Project on SnapDeals.com, on our website,  in stores, in media etc. We already have sold about 500 dresses at cafe SheRoes Hangout and the buyers are super excited about this-  but that means we need the product! For this project to be successful in keeping up the quality of design work that I’m aiming to achieve, I’m looking to raise around 3000 USD or more if I should be seen lucky enough!       I am trying to make my friends happyYou can watch this documentary to see how my friend Ritu changed her mind who had stopped wearing red dresses after the attack. The day she was attacked, Ritu was wearing a red dress. Ritu had bought a red dress on 18th of May for birthday celebration of her niece. “It was a colour I had never worn before.” In the days that followed, the colour became a nightmare for Ritu. “On May 26 last year, campaign celebrated the day by making me wear a red dress designed by Rupa didi,” Ritu says in an interview.

This is our joy! Help us spread joy and sensual happiness to the world through Sen Kouros by donating!  </i><p><i><br/></i></p><p><b>The
Preamble</b></p>
<p>Founder Cyra Jane
Hobson is a lifelong student of sculpture and art who found her passion stone carving in 2009. She has always wanted to become a designer in the adult industry and is always creating couture erotic accoutrements of one kind or another. In 2014, those threads came together when she designed eleven varied and elegant sex toys, each carved of a piece of gifted marble. These became the initial prototypes for production. Shortly afterwards, she hooked up with business partner Linda Cox and the design company Sen Kouros was born. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>The
Sen Kouros</b></p>
<p>Drawn to beauty, we have always sought to
adorn our bodies and our homes with finely crafted materials and textures;
our erotica and erotic devices should be just as stimulating and just as fine. Each kouros is carved from fine Italian marble and hand sanded and sealed with body-safe sealants. <b>Each has a personality and offers temperature play, internal and external massage, rocking g-spot functionality, and solid f*&amp;!ing stimulation.</b> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Philosophically, our
focus at Sen Kouros is on style and arousal, and we use only fine,
natural materials in the creation of our products, carved and finished in the United States and Canada (and maybe someday Italy because <i>that's</i> romantic). We strive to
support our local economies and our culture by partnering with industrial
artisans and fostering creative and healthy work environments for our employees. Our clients' and employees'
health and happiness are our priorities. </p><p>We narrowed the initial prototypes down in focus and testing groups to three designs: The Lustre, The Cold Mistress, and The (____________), (which will be named by one of you)!  Each comes with its own handmade lined microfiber suede bag for storage and travel. </p><p>For care and customer service instructions for your Sen Kouros, please refer to our website (<a href=""http://www.senkouros.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.senkouros.com</a>   - tl;dr for here). </p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1016179/files/20141114192508-SenKouros_1_Lustre.jpg?1416021908"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Isn't It Cold?</b></p><p>If you want it to be! </p><p>Marble and other stones hold temperature exceptionally well. You can prep the stone with warm water or friction if you don't prefer to start with its at rest temperature at ""somewhat cooler than the room."" During play, the kouros will heat up to slightly warmer than your body temperature, then hold and emanate that heat until you set it aside. If you do like it cold, they can go in the freezer or in a cold water bath! </p><b>What We Need</b><p>This
campaign and your support will allow us to bring our dreams to life and into the lives of discerning clients world-wide.  We have poured a lot of sweat, equity and personal time to get this far. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to facilitate production, we need your help to finish building out our design and finishing studio and to pay our production partners and employees with
something more than the passion of our dreams. </p>
<p>
</p><p>$40,000
will cover the tools and materials that we still need to purchase and the necessary funds for fulfillment and the infrastructure to build
this business into a viable company that provides income for
local stone cutters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our dream is that this is the beginning of a long, sustainable artistic relationship between the designer and her clientele. We have so many designs and ideas being thrown on the back burner! </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Your
Reward</b></p>
<p>In addition to the awesome perks we are offering you, supporting
Sen Kouros and helping launch this business successfully gives you an
opportunity to take a small stand against mass production. By
supporting  a small, boutique brand you can help us bring beauty and
sustainability into a market that is in need of more. Finally, a successful Sen Kouros launch means that more artists will
have a venue for their product and an opportunity to earn a living
doing what they love.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1054031/files/20141128114102-SenKouros_3_Unnamed.jpg?1417203662"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>The

She has always wanted to become a designer in the adult industry and is always creating couture erotic accoutrements of one kind or another. In 2014, those threads came together when she designed eleven varied and elegant sex toys, each carved of a piece of gifted marble. These became the initial prototypes for production. Shortly afterwards, she hooked up with business partner Linda Cox and the design company Sen Kouros was born. 

The
Sen Kouros
Drawn to beauty, we have always sought to
adorn our bodies and our homes with finely crafted materials and textures;
our erotica and erotic devices should be just as stimulating and just as fine. Each kouros is carved from fine Italian marble and hand sanded and sealed with body-safe sealants. Each has a personality and offers temperature play, internal and external massage, rocking g-spot functionality, and solid f*&!ing stimulation. 

Philosophically, our
focus at Sen Kouros is on style and arousal, and we use only fine,
natural materials in the creation of our products, carved and finished in the United States and Canada (and maybe someday Italy because that's romantic). We strive to
support our local economies and our culture by partnering with industrial
artisans and fostering creative and healthy work environments for our employees. Our clients' and employees'
health and happiness are our priorities. We narrowed the initial prototypes down in focus and testing groups to three designs: The Lustre, The Cold Mistress, and The (____________), (which will be named by one of you)!  Each comes with its own handmade lined microfiber suede bag for storage and travel. For care and customer service instructions for your Sen Kouros, please refer to our website (www.senkouros.com   - tl;dr for here). 

Isn't It Cold?If you want it to be! Marble and other stones hold temperature exceptionally well. You can prep the stone with warm water or friction if you don't prefer to start with its at rest temperature at ""somewhat cooler than the room."" During play, the kouros will heat up to slightly warmer than your body temperature, then hold and emanate that heat until you set it aside. If you do like it cold, they can go in the freezer or in a cold water bath! What We NeedThis
campaign and your support will allow us to bring our dreams to life and into the lives of discerning clients world-wide.  We have poured a lot of sweat, equity and personal time to get this far. 

In order to facilitate production, we need your help to finish building out our design and finishing studio and to pay our production partners and employees with
something more than the passion of our dreams. 

$40,000
will cover the tools and materials that we still need to purchase and the necessary funds for fulfillment and the infrastructure to build
this business into a viable company that provides income for
local stone cutters.

Our dream is that this is the beginning of a long, sustainable artistic relationship between the designer and her clientele. We have so many designs and ideas being thrown on the back burner! 

Your
Reward
In addition to the awesome perks we are offering you, supporting
Sen Kouros and helping launch this business successfully gives you an
opportunity to take a small stand against mass production. By
supporting  a small, boutique brand you can help us bring beauty and
sustainability into a market that is in need of more. Finally, a successful Sen Kouros launch means that more artists will
have a venue for their product and an opportunity to earn a living
doing what they love.The
Risks
Your
personal risks are small.  We have scaled our business plan
to ensure that every supporter will receive their chosen reward,
regardless of the eventual size of this campaign. The
founders, Cyra Jane Hobson and Linda Cox, have a long and successful
history of bringing new products to market and the project management
expertise necessary to ensure success.

Help
Us Make Some Noise

After all that, we also need more than your cash support. We really need your help in getting
the word out to a larger audience.  Do any of you know industry
influencers?  Luxury reviewers or retailers who might be interested? 
Any media outlets that might be interested in doing a story on the
confluence of luxury and lust? Art and artistry? Send them our campaign! And FinallyThank you! Thank you all! We love you!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

We understand the benefit of having one less device to charge. Revolar Instinct uses a coin cell CR2032 battery, which lasts 6 months to a year, depending on use. When you get below 10% battery life, we'll let you know so you can order a fresh battery (CR2032's are just a couple bucks at your local convenience store).</p><p><i><strong>Are iPads or other tablets compatible with the Revolar Instinct?</strong></i><br/>Revolar Instinct can sync to some Wi-Fi + Cellular tablets, however many tablets aren't compatible at this time. </p><p><i><strong>Can I use my Revolar wearable while traveling internationally?</strong></i><br/>Yes, travel on! As long as you have a data plan and are within a coverage area provided by your smartphone carrier.

I actually just got one for myself as there have been several car jackings lately, and I feel safer knowing I can get help with just a click away. What a great device to have."" - Amazon Customer""This product has exceeded all of my expectations. The product itself is beautiful and lightweight, allowing me to wear it with every outfit. I have the option to keep it hidden in my bra or wear it clipped on to the outside of my pants. The app interface and setup is also really simple and easy for anyone to use."" - Amazon CustomerThe Contact ExperienceContacts don't need the Revolar App to receive alerts, which are sent by text and/or email.Text and email alerts contain a unique link to a map of the user's live location with personalized instructions from the user depending on the alert tier.The Free Revolar AppThis free mobile app allows you to connect Instinct to your smartphone, update your Revolar contact list, customize your alert messages, view your step count, contact Revolar Customer Care, cancel alerts with your PIN, and more.Device CompatibilityInstinct sends alerts by connecting to your synced smartphone via Bluetooth, so it works anywhere in the world where your synced smartphone has data service or WiFi.

*Exclusions apply, some makes/models may be unsupported. Please email hello@revolar.com if you have any questions about your smartphone's compatibility.How Revolar Instinct Works Safety You'll Love WearingWe designed Instinct to be more than just the fastest way to send for help.Instinct helps you stay in touch with positive Check-in messages, move more with step tracking, ditch uncomfortable situations with Ring Me, and get support in non-emergencies with Yellow Alerts. It even chirps to help you find it if it’s misplaced.So why design Instinct with all this power? Because if you love wearing Instinct every day, it will be there when you need it.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat are the dimensions of Revolar Instinct?Revolar Instinct is about the size of a quarter, so you can wear it anywhere.Exact dimensions: 1.3 in x 1.06 in x 0.4 in How water resistant is the Revolar Instinct?Revolar Instinct is IP-68 waterproof. ""IP"" is the international standard for Ingress Protection, and 6 and 8 are the highest ratings for solids (dust) and liquids (water). In short, your Instinct can be submerged in up to 2 meters of water for approximately 30 minutes without an issue. So feel free to take it to the beach, or don't sweat it if it ends up in the wash.Do I need to have my smartphone with me to use Revolar Instinct?Yes, Revolar Instinct connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth® low energy, so you never have to pay an additional monthly fee for discreetly alerting friends and family. Revolar Instinct and your smartphone need to be within Bluetooth range (~30 ft to 50 ft) of each other during use. Does Revolar Instinct drain the battery life of my smartphone?Barely. Revolar Instinct is able to conserve energy by using Bluetooth low energy, which means Instinct uses much less battery life than other types of Bluetooth products.Do I need to charge Revolar Instinct?Nope! We understand the benefit of having one less device to charge. Revolar Instinct uses a coin cell CR2032 battery, which lasts 6 months to a year, depending on use. When you get below 10% battery life, we'll let you know so you can order a fresh battery (CR2032's are just a couple bucks at your local convenience store).Are iPads or other tablets compatible with the Revolar Instinct?Revolar Instinct can sync to some Wi-Fi + Cellular tablets, however many tablets aren't compatible at this time. Can I use my Revolar wearable while traveling internationally?Yes, travel on! As long as you have a data plan and are within a coverage area provided by your smartphone carrier. Bluetooth and data must be enabled while traveling. Review our operating parameters for additional details.Is the Revolar app available in multiple languages?Yes! Currently, English and Spanish languages are supported. Due to the large variety of countries on our list of contributors, we have not yet been able to complete translations of the app for all countries.Are there any ongoing fees?Nope! There is no monthly fee to send alerts or to check in with your loved ones. Standard messaging and data rates may apply.How much is shipping?U.S. shipping is free! You'll see shipping fees outlined in the perk, and after you enter your country during checkout (before payment). For orders outside the U.S., any customs, duties, or taxes are the responsibility of the contributor. Please note that we are unable to mark orders as gifts to get around duties.What if I have more questions?Connect with our team at any time! Send us an email at hello@revolar.com.",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi! my name is Giuseppe, I'm an italian consultant that is working as supplychain consultant in one of the famouse ""big four"" consulting firms.</p>
<p>It's a lot of time that I am thinking to start to work on this project...because.. I would like to solve the problem of a lot of men (mainly) and some women! I want to create CLOTHES POINT!</p>
<p>Clothes Point is a new revolutionary ecommerce site which for the first time sell to you a complete outfitt Ready-to-wear!</p>
<p>It is much more than just an ecommerce! We have partnered with many established brands and high quality new brand. Famouse or not, every brand could help you to compose your perfect look! </p>
<p>Our idea to sell outfit ready to wear eliminates the time spent searching each comination... in particular if you are unable LIKE THE MOST OF THE MEN!</p>
<h3>ECOMMERCE</h3>
<p>Developments to our ecommerce website is that we want to firstly transform. <br/>We created it by ourselves, using a low cost website creation tool, but we really need a profesional that make it for us</p>
<p>We want that users will be able to search their favourite style navigating the website through some criteria like, Favourite fashion blogger, favourite style, ecc... and that the can have a tailored outfit proposal </p>
<h3>Marketing </h3>
<p>A big part of our job as a business, is to make sure we are marketing ourselves regularly. We want to continue to connect with potential users as much as we can to show them what we have to offer. Part of our marketing strategy is to connect where our users will be and that means marketing across various social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, twitter and Tumblr. </p>
<p>We are developing some funny video to promote it, but our resources are not unlimited</p>
<p>In addition other marketing aspects we want to include associations with up and coming Youtubers and celebrities. The effect of forming these associations with these celebrities and youtubers will enable their followers to become aware of Clothes Point and from there sign up to the site in order to stay connected.</p>
<h3>App Development  </h3>
<p>Social media is not only online anymore it is also on apps. This is why we want to use some of the money that we raise from our Kickstarter campaign to develop our very own Clothes Point app. </p>
<p>You are no one without an APP!!!</p>
<p>In addition shopping online is also starting to take the path to apps themselves and so Clothes Point wants to stay ahead of the game and develop our app with our built in ecommerce page. </p>
<h3>So Overall What Are Our Plans For The Future?  </h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a better ecommerce website that suggest you the right outfit for you</li>
<li>Buy Stocks - Some suppliers have a MOQ (minimum order quantity) very high and we can't buy it at the moment</li>
<li>We want to add more established brands </li>
<li>Marketing - We want to make Clothes Point what we think it can be and to make it as big as possible. To do this we want to have effective marketing campaigns to connect with our audience and help build a strong brand that people can trust and believe in. </li>
<li>App development - To stay ahead of the game we want to bring our site as an app. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Challenges we have faced! <br/>We have faced a lot of challenges to get where we are today but continue to overcome each challenge and push forward.</p>
<p>Way back when bwbtcs was just an idea and started to get our site developed we ran in to problems with our web designers and ultimately had to start from scratch all over again. Thank fully we are working with a great team to continue to develop our start day after day and we cannot wait until we can make bwbtcs what it can be.</p>
<p>Another challenge we faced initially was how to go about recruiting established businesses to join our site. This was an easy problem to overcome once we started to show theses business how bwbtcs can help them. And so with completely confident that we can continue to grow the number of businesses on our page giving our users thousands of products to choose from broadening their shopping horizons.</p>

It is much more than just an ecommerce! We have partnered with many established brands and high quality new brand. Famouse or not, every brand could help you to compose your perfect look! 
Our idea to sell outfit ready to wear eliminates the time spent searching each comination... in particular if you are unable LIKE THE MOST OF THE MEN!
ECOMMERCE
Developments to our ecommerce website is that we want to firstly transform. We created it by ourselves, using a low cost website creation tool, but we really need a profesional that make it for us
We want that users will be able to search their favourite style navigating the website through some criteria like, Favourite fashion blogger, favourite style, ecc... and that the can have a tailored outfit proposal 
Marketing 
A big part of our job as a business, is to make sure we are marketing ourselves regularly. We want to continue to connect with potential users as much as we can to show them what we have to offer. Part of our marketing strategy is to connect where our users will be and that means marketing across various social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, twitter and Tumblr. 
We are developing some funny video to promote it, but our resources are not unlimited
In addition other marketing aspects we want to include associations with up and coming Youtubers and celebrities. The effect of forming these associations with these celebrities and youtubers will enable their followers to become aware of Clothes Point and from there sign up to the site in order to stay connected.
App Development  
Social media is not only online anymore it is also on apps. This is why we want to use some of the money that we raise from our Kickstarter campaign to develop our very own Clothes Point app. 
You are no one without an APP!!!
In addition shopping online is also starting to take the path to apps themselves and so Clothes Point wants to stay ahead of the game and develop our app with our built in ecommerce page. 
So Overall What Are Our Plans For The Future?  

Create a better ecommerce website that suggest you the right outfit for you
Buy Stocks - Some suppliers have a MOQ (minimum order quantity) very high and we can't buy it at the moment
We want to add more established brands 
Marketing - We want to make Clothes Point what we think it can be and to make it as big as possible. To do this we want to have effective marketing campaigns to connect with our audience and help build a strong brand that people can trust and believe in. 
App development - To stay ahead of the game we want to bring our site as an app. 

Risks and challenges
Challenges we have faced! We have faced a lot of challenges to get where we are today but continue to overcome each challenge and push forward.
Way back when bwbtcs was just an idea and started to get our site developed we ran in to problems with our web designers and ultimately had to start from scratch all over again. Thank fully we are working with a great team to continue to develop our start day after day and we cannot wait until we can make bwbtcs what it can be.
Another challenge we faced initially was how to go about recruiting established businesses to join our site. This was an easy problem to overcome once we started to show theses business how bwbtcs can help them. And so with completely confident that we can continue to grow the number of businesses on our page giving our users thousands of products to choose from broadening their shopping horizons.",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

Diffuse and intensify yourself
 
So, what is Durée?
Durée is both fashionable and functional bracelet that diffuses, magnifies, intensifies, and lengthens the scent of your fragrance.
For some mysterious reason (actually volatile chemicals from a fragrance evaporates quiet quickly from our skin and clothes), unless we put on a tremendous amount of fragrance (until our nostrils start to hurt), the scent of our favorite perfume or cologne is gone by the time we get to that important meeting or by late afternoon.
Now, though, with a single spray on Durée, you can enjoy the most effective dispersal and a complete rendering of your favorite scent.
 
 How does Durée work?On the inside of Durée runs a thin lining of pure, organic plaster that absorbs the fragrance and evenly diffuses the scent.The traditional advice for perfume application is that it should be dabbed on a pulse point to be effective as possible.Placing Durée, right on the pulse point, enables the body heat generated from the pulse to magnify the scent.  The Design - Durée completes the fashion.Adjectives that describe the design- casual, elegant, sleek, modern, ergonomic, delicate, chic, fashionable, fine, completeAppearance

<p>The Philosopher is designed to be an instrument of time, and it celebrates our ability to think differently. The shape of the case is conical, with a base wider than its face, creating a sharp characteristic two-piece dial that brings us hurtling through time to this moment now. The watch case has an elevated, and clean brushed look because of the way that the lugs tug under it. The asymmetric second hand that appears to continuously slice through time reminds us to learn from the past, act now, and create a better future.</p>

<p>The Infinity is inspired by nature, and our relationship with the environment around us. This design removes complexity to arrive at simplicity, as if it was crafted by evolution itself. The cone shaped case, deep curved dial, and hourly marks that attach to the edge of the face move our imagination into thinking about the infinite space of the universe. While the way the strap slides directly into the case, without lugs, gives the watch a clean, round feel.</p>

Infinity, 40mm, Silver
 
Native, 36mm, Rose Gold
 

 

Our mission is to create classic Scandinavian designs that truly meet the bar set by other famous Scandinavian designers (but without the price-tag).

Who would you want to work with to achieve this? Jakob Wagner, of course. Jakob has worked with Bang & Olufsen, Hay, Muuto, and many more. We're not the only ones who really like his work - he's been handed multiple design awards, with one of his pieces now part of the permanent collection at MoMA, New York.

We are going to play our part in making sustainable change across the globe. Every watch will contribute to a meaningful cause, and the choice is handed over to the owner. All you need is the serial number from the case back, and the unique identification code from the Certificate of Authenticity to make your choice and follow the results.
 

 

 

 

 

 
The Philosopher is designed to be an instrument of time, and it celebrates our ability to think differently. The shape of the case is conical, with a base wider than its face, creating a sharp characteristic two-piece dial that brings us hurtling through time to this moment now. The watch case has an elevated, and clean brushed look because of the way that the lugs tug under it. The asymmetric second hand that appears to continuously slice through time reminds us to learn from the past, act now, and create a better future.

 

 

 

 

The Infinity is inspired by nature, and our relationship with the environment around us. This design removes complexity to arrive at simplicity, as if it was crafted by evolution itself. The cone shaped case, deep curved dial, and hourly marks that attach to the edge of the face move our imagination into thinking about the infinite space of the universe. While the way the strap slides directly into the case, without lugs, gives the watch a clean, round feel.

 

 

 

 

The Native is all about balance. Balance is the secret to the happy life of a Copenhagen local. This timepiece is a classic, completely redefined. Simple, yet sophisticated due to the attention to details. The elevated design is a result of the rounded case. The clean dial, subtle, light grey minute marks, and rounded lugs give the watch a classic, distinctive look. The concept is human-centered, and designed to be worn by anyone, anywhere.

 

 

 

 

 

All of our straps come with a ""quick-release"" function, allowing you to change the look of your watch within a matter of seconds. And best of all, no tools are needed.

<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Background to L for LAZARUS</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>My mother taught me from an early age that although fashion was important, it was even more important to know what suited me, and to develop my own personal style.</p>
<p>With <em>L for LAZARUS</em>, I set out to challenge some fashion industry 'rules' because:</p>
<p>- The industry is based on designers producing entire collections, even if only a few items are <em>really</em> innovative. </p>
<p>- Each season, women rarely buy multiple pieces from the same designer.</p>
<p>- There’s little true fashion innovation, and if it's really innovative, then little of it is truly wearable.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/292738/pictures/full/20120625074415-_MG_2582.jpg?1340635477"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 18px; margin-right: 18px;""/><p>But I love the idea of personal style and wearable innovation.  I did my research and found out that I’m not alone; the women I spoke with told me that they wanted timeless, beautifully-made items that:</p>
<p><em>- Enhance their personal style</em></p>
<p><em>- Work with their current wardrobe for multiple seasons</em></p>
<p><em>- Are as versatile as they are</em></p>
<p><em>- And thus represent value for money.</em></p>
<p>So I set myself the task to create pieces that are stylish, practical, and versatile.</p>
<p><strong>Why I need your help</strong></p>
<p>To date, everything for L for LAZARUS has been self-funded and by calling in favours from my extremely talented friends who include photographers and models.  I currently do everything myself from design and sourcing to production, marketing and sales.</p>
This project is to raise $20,000 to actually manufacture the new <em>L for LAZARUS</em> Fall/Winter collection.  Everything has been designed, sampled, and photographed and I have retailers and webshops who want to take the collection, but as I'm a new brand, most of the deals I have are on a consignment basis.  I have only until the end of this project before I need to place final orders. But with your help, the collection will be available for general purchase this September.    
<p><strong>What the funds will be used for</strong></p>
<p>- Manufacture of the new collection pieces you've seen above</p>
<p>- Artwork &amp; print for labels and hangtags </p>
<p>- An intern to help me out one day a week </p>
<p>- P.R. support to contact bloggers, journalists etc. to help promote the collection</p>
<p>- The Indiegigo fee (4-9% of the total raised)</p>
<p>Any additional funds raised will go towards production of samples for the<em> L for LAZARUS</em> Spring/Summer 2013 collection.   I've got some great new ideas and found some excellent production partners.</p>
<p><strong>Every contribution, no matter how small, is greatly appreciated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And there are also incentives to 'spread the word' about this project, even if you can't contribute financially...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Contribution to postage <strong>NO NEED TO ADD POSTAGE IF YOU LIVE IN AMSTERDAM AND CAN MEET ME IN PERSON TO COLLECT YOUR INCENTIVE!</strong> </strong>Postage is pretty expensive.  For example, it costs over $30 to send some of the collection items to the U.S.A.  But I wanted to keep the cost as transparent as possible and, as I'm trying to raise much needed funds, I'm therefore asking for a contribution towards the postage cost of each item. <strong><br/></strong></p>

</div></div>","Thank you for visiting my project page.  
My name is Nicolette Lazarus, founder and creative director at                    L for LAZARUS, an innovative fashion accessories brand based in Amsterdam. 
L for LAZARUS create unique, stylish yet practical fashion accessories. It's a brand women for who love to follow fashion but, more importantly, have developed an inner confidence and their own personal sence of style.  
It's a brand for women who are comfortable with who they are, and know what they want from fashion accessories: style, quality, versatility, and the ability to transform their look on a daily basis.
In March 2011, I left my career in advertising to set up                L for LAZARUS.  And in October, I successfully launched my first product, the Échapeau, a stylish yet practical hat and scarf combination that can be worn:
- As one stylish piece 
- Or as a classic hat & scarf set 
- Or as individual items.
You can read more about L for LAZARUS by scrolling down. But first, let me present my Fall/Winter 2012 Collection, because the $20,000 I need is to manufacture these great pieces; and because these are the incentives I’m offering in return for your support.
They'll make a great addition to your wardrobe and earn you plenty of kudos when given as a gift!  
In other words, if you like what you see,  use this project to pre-order and help us out in the process!

<p>We were trying to work out a way to help her when we learned about Indiegogo. We figured that we could create an online community that shows people how important cheer (and sport) has been in our lives. We do well in school, we don't do any of the bad stuff some kids do and we train...a lot. So we think we'd be good cheer role models.</p>
<p>Cheer is an elite sport, like hockey, so its expensive. For both of us its $7,000 this year. We're hoping that we can have people follow us on the road to the World Championships in April and have them feel part of this great YEAR OF CHEER!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $7,000 in order to pay for the extra training, choreography, uniforms, practice gear, shoes, travel, travel accommodation etc. But we also feel that if we raise more we want to help out some other kids at our club who have trouble covering the costs too.</p>
<p>We have some really fun perks including a TRIBZSIBZ limited edition t-shirt with our cool logo. (comes with the $75, $100 and $150 perks!!)</p>

<p>I (Layne) have a learning disability that was diagnosed in grade 2 and Shaye was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease this year.

<p>This is what Shaye looked like when she was really sick :(</p>

<p>We want to show people that no matter what challenges you face in life, sport can really help you build self-esteem and know what it means to be involved in something bigger than yourself. </p>

<p>Now that we're 12 and 15 we realize we're fortunate because she has made some pretty major sacrifices for us to do what we love. </p>
<p>We want to pay that forward by helping her and maybe helping some other families too. </p>
<p>Everyone should know what it feels like to work toward their dream. </p>

Hi there! We're Layne and Shaye and we're elite-level cheerleaders living in North Vancouver, Canada. 



We love cheer and we love our mom. Cheer, mom, cheer, mom. CHEER MOM! 
Our mom has supported our passion for cheer for 9 years. She works really hard to make sure that we get to do what we love but its a struggle because she works in non-profit and doesn't make a ton of money.
We were trying to work out a way to help her when we learned about Indiegogo. We figured that we could create an online community that shows people how important cheer (and sport) has been in our lives. We do well in school, we don't do any of the bad stuff some kids do and we train...a lot. So we think we'd be good cheer role models.
