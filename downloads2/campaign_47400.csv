My name is Destiny Ezurs and I am the founder of The Leyef and Art Foundation. First off, I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself and how my dream of owning a charity came to life. Growing up I experienced what no child, nor human for that matter, should have to face. I was born into an abusive, drug infected home and then placed into the foster care system by social services who deemed my living situation inadequate. Unfortunately, what I experienced in the foster system was no better than my previous living situation. At seven years-old I was adopted, but later emancipated myself from my adoptive family when they began to both mentally and verbally abuse me. My childhood was a constant battle, I suffered and I watched children around me suffer, and for that reason I created this charity. Despite the neglect I suffered, I consider myself fortunate because it brought me to where I am today. If it had not been for the childhood I had lived, I may not have created this charity. Since the day I learned what a charity was, I knew it was something I wanted to create. Not so much for myself, but for the suffering children I met in the foster care system. </p><p>Although I lived a life that was more difficult then most, I still managed to successfully start my own business and I continue to live my life as a role model for those that need inspiration. I know I have many things and people to thank for my success. Influential friends whom had healthy thriving homes, gymnastics which taught me discipline and helped me realize my worth and books that helped my mind and imagination grow. As well as a funding program provided by Social Services that supported me through college.</p><p>My charity is bringing these crucial things together to create a system that supports children and young adults being affected by abuse, neglect or have been orphaned.</p><p>Teaming with Dreams in Motion, The Leyef and Art Foundation will be touring public schools to inform children that we are here to help them if they need. It is our plan to inform children of what abuse is, how it can be prevented and how one can heal from such circumstances. They will be given the opportunity to reach out to us through, phone, email or letter to inform of us of how they need our help and support. After assessing a child's needs, they will be asked to read a book from a large list of inspiring books that The Leyef and Art Foundation believes help nourish the mind, esteem and soul. They will then be asked to write a letter explaining their needs and asked to fill out an application that opens communication and helps us understand their situation. I know personally that communication is key to successfully helping anyone in times of need.</p><p>The Leyef and Art Foundation will fund the dreams, passions and god given rights of those affected by neglect or abuse and because of my personal background in fitness, we will focus on making sure these kids are living well, eating healthy and being active. </p><p><br/></p><p></p>As you can see from the video posted we already had our first charity event in May 2013. Unfortunately after all this hard work, the charity broke even because of two things I didn't factor into this when planning this event:<br/>A) The total cost<br/>B) The devastating impact of a low attendance.<div>Even so the show went on and the people who attended LOVED IT. The talent, beauty and pure entertainment was undeniable. People had never seen anything quite like it before. Except for on the television when they were watching The Victorias Secret Fashion Show. I guess most first time charity events are not the best and this is something I was unaware of but learned quickly. All of the performers seen the potential that the show had to create funds for people in need and agreed to perform at the next show. I was encouraged by those that attended to push forward with another show and promised that now that people had caught wind of the charity show and its cause that it would do better its second time round. The guests wanted to know when the next one was and how they could help make sure it happened. And this is exactly how: Donate. <p><br/></p>

<br/><p></p>
<h1>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h1>
<p></p>
<h4><ul>
<li>We need this money to have the 2nd Annual Charity Fashion Show. This is a highly entertaining way of coming together for a good cause. In doing so, it showcases the arts and talents of gifted people in a big way and encourages artists and performers to follow their dreams and passions. This charity creates an event that, before people like you and I, had only wished we could go to. Because lets be honest, we all wish we could go to the Victorias Secret Fashion Show and I believe we all wish we could go in support of a good cause rather than that of a multibillion dollar corporation. We are looking to hold the next event in Calgary, Alberta during the world renowned Calgary Stampede at the Hotel Arts. The Calgary Stampede attendance totals over 1 million guests during its 10 days, averaging at about 150,000 people a day. </li>
<li>We plan on making this event so successful that we can tour Canada and then hopefully make our way world wide. But we need your help in doing so!</li>
<li>I almost gave up on my ability to help the people I always dreamed of helping. After the long hard work of creating the show and not being able to donate a dollar, I wanted to throw in the towel. But I've learned that in business and life, to become successful, often you have to try over and over again. So here I am reaching out to the world to help me, help others.</li>
</ul></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Similar as to what is listed above we will need :</p>
<blockquote>$1500 for advertising<br/><br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>$1500 to create a video for future advertising as well as a place to make honorary mentions of the largest donors and supporters.<br/><br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Up to $1000 for lights, sound system and piano.<br/><br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>$15,000 for the rental of the Hotel Arts Spectrum Ballroom. <br/><br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>$6,400 for additional wings and supplies to make more wings and costumes.($400 per model - 16 models) </blockquote>
<blockquote>$2000 for red carpet ,drapery and stage rentals.</blockquote>
<blockquote>$6,400 for high brand name lingerie that IS NOT MADE IN A SWEATSHOP ($400 per model)(Our local lingerie stores have been in trouble in the past for having fabrics made in places that do not pay or under pay and use child labour.)</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOTE: The lingerie and wings will not need to be purchased again after these purchases and will be used for future shows so that charity profit is increased and expenditure decreased.</blockquote>
<blockquote>$6,000 for food, travel and accommodations for most of the performers and models who are from out of town.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Transportation for models and performers from Edmonton on a Charter Bus discounted from Red Arrow $4,000.</blockquote>
<blockquote>TOTAL of $43,800.00</blockquote>
<blockquote><br/></blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<h3><b>PROFITS</b></h3>
<p>Event will hold 600 guests </p>
<p>Ticket Sales 100 VIP tickets
at $220 = $22,000</p>
<p>General Tickets at 500 tickets at $110 =
$55,000</p>
<p>Calendars ($30 profit) and
Photos sold of models (20$) =raise approx : $10,000  </p>
<p>ESTIMATED FUNDS RAISED = $87,000 +</p>
<p>We will also be accepting generous donations at the door that may bring in X amount of monies.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>This will help our charity get its feet up off the ground and become a recognized and self sufficient cause that has funds to assist in all of the ways it was created for. </p>
<ul>
<li>Once we make this cause and show known worldwide, we will be able to hold these events as often as 2-3 times a year. Large events like this can raise such large amounts of dollars (upwards of a quarter million dollars or more) for children, youth and young adults that have been affected by abuse or neglect of any kind If we have it sell out in venues that hold at least 2200 people.</li>
<li>We have already put in so much work and effort to run the first event now we just need the help and support of you to help awaken others to the good thing that the many performers and models have come together to create. We know we care and we have our hearts and minds in the right place, now we just need assistance worldwide to help catapult this charity event into the first of its kind. We envision creating an event that raises money worldwide through an entertaining show that many people truly enjoy. One that can help showcase the passions of people who follow their dreams regardless of their past.</li>
<li>We will be able to tour schools freely and offer students our assistance. Educate them on abuse and neglect and assist them in in the multiple ways that they need. This means feeding them nutritious food when their own family is unable to, or pay for extracurricular activities when their family cannot etc. We will also be building an office space where the youth can seek help from a counsellor or others like myself who have experienced abuse or neglect and know first hand how to properly deal with situations. </li>
</ul>

<h2><b><i>LAST YEAR'S REVIEWS</i></b></h2>
<p>I had the pleasure of attending The 1<sup>st</sup>
Annual Leyef and Art Charity Fashion Show and to say I was really impressed
would be an understatement. I've never seen anything like this show before and
I really enjoyed myself. The pre-show mixer was very elegant, the décor was
nice and classy and they served several choices of Wines and Hors d'oeuvre that
I quite enjoyed. When the show began I really wasn’t sure what to expect, but
as one act finished and the other began I found myself captivated by it all. I
simply couldn’t wait to see what was next to come and I kept hoping that there
was more. I felt like I was at a glamorous fashion show in Paris or Milan. From
runway models in beautiful outfits to professional dancers and acrobatics, this
show featured a little bit for everyone. I came to watch the show with a certain
expectation in mind and my expectations were not only met but they were
exceeded. I would recommend this show to anyone and everyone. If you enjoy
Glamorous evenings with captivating performances that will keep you excited all
night this one is a must see.</p>

<p>I've attended my fair share of charity events,
enough to know what to expect from them. So I was surprised at the excitement
and diversity I experienced at Destiny's show. From beginning to end it
captured everyone's attention, and was easy to see the imagination and planning
that went into everything. I look forward to attending her second show!</p>

<p>What a show! I have never attended a charity
event with so many different acts going on. One minute I was enjoying a break
dance show, and the next minute I was being stunned by beautiful models. There
was such a wide range of entertainment on stage that anybody would love this
event. I will definitely be attending again.</p>

My name is Destiny Ezurs and I am the founder of The Leyef and Art Foundation. First off, I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself and how my dream of owning a charity came to life. Growing up I experienced what no child, nor human for that matter, should have to face. I was born into an abusive, drug infected home and then placed into the foster care system by social services who deemed my living situation inadequate. Unfortunately, what I experienced in the foster system was no better than my previous living situation.

Despite the neglect I suffered, I consider myself fortunate because it brought me to where I am today. If it had not been for the childhood I had lived, I may not have created this charity.

I know I have many things and people to thank for my success. Influential friends whom had healthy thriving homes, gymnastics which taught me discipline and helped me realize my worth and books that helped my mind and imagination grow. As well as a funding program provided by Social Services that supported me through college.My charity is bringing these crucial things together to create a system that supports children and young adults being affected by abuse, neglect or have been orphaned.Teaming with Dreams in Motion, The Leyef and Art Foundation will be touring public schools to inform children that we are here to help them if they need. It is our plan to inform children of what abuse is, how it can be prevented and how one can heal from such circumstances. They will be given the opportunity to reach out to us through, phone, email or letter to inform of us of how they need our help and support. After assessing a child's needs, they will be asked to read a book from a large list of inspiring books that The Leyef and Art Foundation believes help nourish the mind, esteem and soul. They will then be asked to write a letter explaining their needs and asked to fill out an application that opens communication and helps us understand their situation. I know personally that communication is key to successfully helping anyone in times of need.The Leyef and Art Foundation will fund the dreams, passions and god given rights of those affected by neglect or abuse and because of my personal background in fitness, we will focus on making sure these kids are living well, eating healthy and being active. As you can see from the video posted we already had our first charity event in May 2013. Unfortunately after all this hard work, the charity broke even because of two things I didn't factor into this when planning this event:A) The total costB) The devastating impact of a low attendance.Even so the show went on and the people who attended LOVED IT.

I was encouraged by those that attended to push forward with another show and promised that now that people had caught wind of the charity show and its cause that it would do better its second time round. The guests wanted to know when the next one was and how they could help make sure it happened. And this is exactly how: Donate. 



What We Need & What You Get


We need this money to have the 2nd Annual Charity Fashion Show. This is a highly entertaining way of coming together for a good cause. In doing so, it showcases the arts and talents of gifted people in a big way and encourages artists and performers to follow their dreams and passions. This charity creates an event that, before people like you and I, had only wished we could go to. Because lets be honest, we all wish we could go to the Victorias Secret Fashion Show and I believe we all wish we could go in support of a good cause rather than that of a multibillion dollar corporation. We are looking to hold the next event in Calgary, Alberta during the world renowned Calgary Stampede at the Hotel Arts. The Calgary Stampede attendance totals over 1 million guests during its 10 days, averaging at about 150,000 people a day. 
We plan on making this event so successful that we can tour Canada and then hopefully make our way world wide. But we need your help in doing so!
I almost gave up on my ability to help the people I always dreamed of helping. After the long hard work of creating the show and not being able to donate a dollar, I wanted to throw in the towel. But I've learned that in business and life, to become successful, often you have to try over and over again. So here I am reaching out to the world to help me, help others.


Similar as to what is listed above we will need :
$1500 for advertising

$1500 to create a video for future advertising as well as a place to make honorary mentions of the largest donors and supporters.

Up to $1000 for lights, sound system and piano.

$15,000 for the rental of the Hotel Arts Spectrum Ballroom. 

$6,400 for additional wings and supplies to make more wings and costumes.($400 per model - 16 models) 
$2000 for red carpet ,drapery and stage rentals.
$6,400 for high brand name lingerie that IS NOT MADE IN A SWEATSHOP ($400 per model)(Our local lingerie stores have been in trouble in the past for having fabrics made in places that do not pay or under pay and use child labour.)
NOTE: The lingerie and wings will not need to be purchased again after these purchases and will be used for future shows so that charity profit is increased and expenditure decreased.
$6,000 for food, travel and accommodations for most of the performers and models who are from out of town.
Transportation for models and performers from Edmonton on a Charter Bus discounted from Red Arrow $4,000.
TOTAL of $43,800.00


PROFITS
Event will hold 600 guests 
Ticket Sales 100 VIP tickets
at $220 = $22,000
General Tickets at 500 tickets at $110 =
$55,000
Calendars ($30 profit) and
Photos sold of models (20$) =raise approx : $10,000  
ESTIMATED FUNDS RAISED = $87,000 +
We will also be accepting generous donations at the door that may bring in X amount of monies.
The Impact
This will help our charity get its feet up off the ground and become a recognized and self sufficient cause that has funds to assist in all of the ways it was created for. 

Once we make this cause and show known worldwide, we will be able to hold these events as often as 2-3 times a year. Large events like this can raise such large amounts of dollars (upwards of a quarter million dollars or more) for children, youth and young adults that have been affected by abuse or neglect of any kind If we have it sell out in venues that hold at least 2200 people.
We have already put in so much work and effort to run the first event now we just need the help and support of you to help awaken others to the good thing that the many performers and models have come together to create. We know we care and we have our hearts and minds in the right place, now we just need assistance worldwide to help catapult this charity event into the first of its kind. We envision creating an event that raises money worldwide through an entertaining show that many people truly enjoy. One that can help showcase the passions of people who follow their dreams regardless of their past.
We will be able to tour schools freely and offer students our assistance. Educate them on abuse and neglect and assist them in in the multiple ways that they need. This means feeding them nutritious food when their own family is unable to, or pay for extracurricular activities when their family cannot etc. We will also be building an office space where the youth can seek help from a counsellor or others like myself who have experienced abuse or neglect and know first hand how to properly deal with situations.

Courtney, Roxy and Rosina Backstage at the 1st Annual Show



LAST YEAR'S REVIEWS
I had the pleasure of attending The 1st
Annual Leyef and Art Charity Fashion Show and to say I was really impressed
would be an understatement. I've never seen anything like this show before and
I really enjoyed myself. The pre-show mixer was very elegant, the décor was
nice and classy and they served several choices of Wines and Hors d'oeuvre that
I quite enjoyed. When the show began I really wasn’t sure what to expect, but
as one act finished and the other began I found myself captivated by it all. I
simply couldn’t wait to see what was next to come and I kept hoping that there
was more. I felt like I was at a glamorous fashion show in Paris or Milan. From
runway models in beautiful outfits to professional dancers and acrobatics, this
show featured a little bit for everyone. I came to watch the show with a certain
expectation in mind and my expectations were not only met but they were
exceeded. I would recommend this show to anyone and everyone. If you enjoy
Glamorous evenings with captivating performances that will keep you excited all
night this one is a must see.

I've attended my fair share of charity events,
enough to know what to expect from them. So I was surprised at the excitement
and diversity I experienced at Destiny's show. From beginning to end it
captured everyone's attention, and was easy to see the imagination and planning
that went into everything. I look forward to attending her second show!

What a show! I have never attended a charity
event with so many different acts going on. One minute I was enjoying a break
dance show, and the next minute I was being stunned by beautiful models. There
was such a wide range of entertainment on stage that anybody would love this
event. I will definitely be attending again.

We breathe more than 10,000 liters of air every day. But air not only keeps us alive - it also transports a variety of particles that can be harmful to our health.Have you ever had an allergic reaction to pollen in the air? Infected yourself during flu season? Do you live in a large city, smelling traffic fumes every day?Just like food or water, the quality of the air we breathe daily affects our health and well being. In our ever more crowded environment, air quality has constantly decreased.This is why we created SportsMask, built on the vision to create a world where everyone can breathe clean and healthy air. We believe that people who want to breathe healthy, should have a reliable and fashionable way to do so.Drawbacks of Existing MasksEach of these mask types suffers from the following three issues.Poor face seals: Existing masks don't always achieve an adequate seal on the face, resulting in decreased protection [1]High waste and cost: N95 masks are intended to be changed regularly, which is inconvenient and expensive in many use casesScalability of manufacturing: Face masks cannot be produced fast enough to meet the demands of both the health care system and general publicCotton masks often have leakage problems and filter only twelve percent of pollution particles, Disposable masks have leakage problems and they are uncomfortable to wear.Air Leakage is very common for disposable masks.The Problem9 out of 10 people now breathe air containing high levels of pollution. Updated estimates reveal an alarming death toll of 7 million people every year due to outdoor and house air pollution. Air pollution, dusty neighborhood, contaminated environment... you need to wear a  mask. But do all anti-air pollution air filter masks or face masks ensure the same level of protection?In order for a face mask to be effective, it needs to be well sealed, and dense enough to filter out tiny particles as small as 0.1μm. While large amounts of pollution are visible to the naked eye (eg. smoke), they are still present in harmful quantities when not visible.Introducing SportsMask: Superior Airflow & Breathing Protection Order your Lyfy masks directly on  Lyfy.co! The SportsMask addresses the problems with existing masks and offers clear advantages over competitive options. These benefits include:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<h3>I was just 9 years old when I started learning to sew; first from my mom and aunt, and then by trial and error.  There was no formal instruction available for children my age.  Instead, you needed to wait until highschool or college to learn in structured classes, taught as part of a larger curriculum.  I knew at that early age that I had a passion for this pursuit, so inevitably I turned my early instruction into a career in fashion; attending the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising (FIDM), eventually striking out on my own and designing evening gowns for the Hollywood crowd, bridal gowns, and ultimately becoming a costume designer on feature films.</h3>
<h3>Several years ago, the recession affected the film industry, leaving many crew members in L.A. in need of other pursuits.  My work became a little sparse, and typically involved traveling to other locations for film shoots.  I became engaged and decided to move east with my fiance' with his work.  I found myself in the charming town of Mooresville, NC, a rapidly growing community of about 35,000.  Around that time I was reading the book ""One Month to Live"" by Pastor Kerry Shook, and gave some serious thought to what I would want to do if I only had one month to live.  </h3>
<h3> I realized that I would want to somehow pass on my knowledge and passion for my craft and that this could be my special ministry and contribution.   Because I had no children of my own, and my fiances' children were grown, I began to think of a way to teach the next generation in a studio environment.    With young families, good schools and a vibrant community, this seemed a perfect place to set up a studio and teach sewing and fashion design to children of all ages.  Fashion was becoming very main-stream in the media with shows like ""What Not To Wear"" and particularly the show ""Project Runway"" had many little girls dreaming of becoming fashion designers and, seeing that many of the designers on the show were young, they had better start learning!  This was the birth of the concept of Future Fashion Designers (FFD).  We opened in January 2010.</h3>
<h3>The community is excited that FFD is here, and we have been enthusiastically received. I get calls from all over NC and even other states to see if we have anything available in their location.  The studio is in the downtown area full of history and foot traffic!  A few months after opening, FFD was featured in the popular local Lake Norman Magazine, with one of my students gracing the cover in one of the evening gowns I created.  That article really opened things up.  The studio was new and exciting for the town and we were building and formulating our lesson plans and offerings in anticipation of even more rapid growth following the recession.  This remains our expectation.</h3>
<h3> FFD began with a personal investment, credit cards and a $10,000 loan which had been expended with equipment, advertising, and overhead costs of the startup.  There are many loyal students and families eager to continue classes.  We are seeking creative ways to maintain through these temporary economical challenges.</h3>
<h3>Consideration has been given for turning FFD into a non-profit venture, which will enable us to do more advertising and special projects like fashion shows and other events.  Attaining non-profit status is a lengthy process, and will cost about $800 for the fee just to apply. I think it's a good way to go and exciting to have a educatiuonal non-profit for kids who want to investigate the fashion world.  There are almost no fashion schools for kids and very few sewing schools especially focused on kids who want to learn, surprisingly since the schools don't offer it anymore.  Sewing is becoming a dying art and such a necessary foundation for anyone who wants to have a career in fashion.  Plus, designing and sewing is a great way to build self-esteem in young girls.  They get so elated when they see themselves creating something from nothing.  They think it, design it and then create. it.                                            </h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Learning to sew and learning about fashion design is not only fun for kids but a very useful skill that can lead to a lifelong career.  Currently there are almost no fashion schools for kids and very few sewing schools that are focused on kids who want to learn.  Most curriculum-based schools have eliminated sewing in favor of other classes.  If no family member is availabe to teach, any child who wishes to learn has to seek out instruction elsewhere, and typically misses the opportunity for rapid learning that youth presents.  All of these combine to present a unique and exciting opportunity to fill a much needed niche market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need an additional $10,000 to continue to provide the unique studio space, with a rent of $1000 a month and all the bills that go with it; electricity, phone, liability, part-time instructors, and materials used for the classes.  Most importantly it will help us to do more advertising especially for summer camps which can help us even more if we can get the camps full.  A little more advertising would help considerably as each additional student places FFD in a firmer position to continue.  Also, it will help us to get the non-profit status that will enable us to find grants and community donations to grow and be able to offer even more programs and events like fashion shows and special events for the kids.  We are pursuing the non-profit status and plan to submit in the next few months. The students truly love the studio atmosphere and the space to spread out and create.  I just love their faces when they come in to the studio for the first time, their mouths open in awe and their eyes light up, ""A studio just for them!""....so cute!  Your support will help keep that excitement alive, teach young girls and boys valuable skills and help build our next generation of fashion designers.</p>

<h1><b>THE VISION</b></h1>
<p>Our mission at NoneLikeMe is to create a clothing line that truly embodies what it means to be an individual. </p>
<p><b>But...</b> We also recognize that together we are all part of a bigger picture, so it was important to us that NoneLikeMe be about more than just clothes. </p>
<p>As the project developed, we realized it was important that we serve as a platform for progress &amp; social change. </p>
<p>We took a look at other social entrepreneurship companies like <b>TOMS </b>Shoes who donate one pair of shoes for every pair of shoes purchased or <b>Warby Parker</b> who donate a pair of eyeglasses for every purchase and noticed one major commonality... </p>
<p>They are all offering their products as donations. While we agree that's wonderful, we made the decision to make <b>Cash Donations </b>directly to charitable organizations that are already making a major impact.</p>

<p>2. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help spread the word.</p>
<p>3. A major part of what will make NoneLikeMe a success will be forming solid partnerships with the causes we want to design for &amp; donate to.</p>
<p>4. Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a local design printer and have established a solid relationship, which has given us a lot of confidence in them.</p>

<p></p></span></span></div>","THE VISION
Our mission at NoneLikeMe is to create a clothing line that truly embodies what it means to be an individual. 
But... We also recognize that together we are all part of a bigger picture, so it was important to us that NoneLikeMe be about more than just clothes. 
As the project developed, we realized it was important that we serve as a platform for progress & social change. 
We took a look at other social entrepreneurship companies like TOMS Shoes who donate one pair of shoes for every pair of shoes purchased or Warby Parker who donate a pair of eyeglasses for every purchase and noticed one major commonality... 
They are all offering their products as donations. While we agree that's wonderful, we made the decision to make Cash Donations directly to charitable organizations that are already making a major impact.

And whether or not you decide to make a donation, we appreciate you taking the time to check us out :)


IMPORTANT!!


Many of you have asked how you can get our tees & apparel right now...

All you have to do is click here and make a donation of $25 and you will receive one of our tees as a reward for your donation.


THE CAUSES





Human Rights Watch
The Human Rights Watch is dedicated to defending and protecting all human rights. They give a voice to the oppressed and hold oppressors accountable for their crimes.
For more than 30 years, Human Rights Watch has worked tenaciously to lay the legal and moral groundwork for deep-rooted change and has fought to bring greater justice and security to people around the world.
Invisible Children

Invisible Children believes in the equal and inherent value of all human life. They understand that a worldview bound by borders is outdated and that stopping injustice anywhere is the responsibility of humanity everywhere.
They work tirelessly to rehabilitate children directly affected by the Lords Resistance Army and invest in education and economic recovery programs in the post-conflict region to promote lasting peace.

Ronald McDonald House Charities

The mission of Ronald McDonald House Charities is to create, find and support programs that directly improve the health and well being of children.
RMHC holds a special place in our hearts because in 2011, when our founders younger brother at the age of 13 collapsed at school and went into cardiac arrest as the result of a heart defect, it was the incredible staff of doctors & nurses at Rady Children's Hospital Ronald McDonald House in San Diego that was in part, responsible for saving his life.

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CAUSES...


What's the first cause NoneLikeMe will be donating to?
We've centered our complete first design collection around human rights issues, and will be giving our first donation proceeds to the Human Rights Watch. 
Why the Human Rights Watch??

Because they are one of the world’s leading independent organizations dedicated to defending and protecting human rights for all. 







What makes us different from other clothing for causes brands?

What we feel part of what makes us different is that rather than sticking with just a single cause to design for & donate to, our team decided we wanted to be able to further help as many causes as we possibly could with our clothing. 
Which is why we made the decision to change our partner cause every 6 months. A part of our long term goal is to partner with the organizations we want to design for because as NoneLikeMe grows in awareness and recognition, so will the profound messages of our partner causes. 
How do we pick our causes?
There are so many amazing causes currently making innovative changes in society & making an impact around the world, so it was really hard to pick which one to design for and donate to first. The causes we're seeking to partner with are those that go beyond simply raising awareness, but are actively helping to make changes in the lives of those they come into contact with.



THE CLOTHES


We've only just begun.

Our first collection is still growing, and our wonderful team of designers & creatives are hard at work developing new design concepts for our t-shirts & apparel.





      
While creating our 1st collection, we wanted to make sure of a few very important details:


That our designs always reflect our partner causes in an inspiring, artistic & thought provoking way.

That the fabrics we use are made from high-quality, ethically made certified organic cotton.
Which is why we print our shirts on fabric exclusively from Alternative Apparel.

2. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help spread the word.
3. A major part of what will make NoneLikeMe a success will be forming solid partnerships with the causes we want to design for & donate to.
4. Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a local design printer and have established a solid relationship, which has given us a lot of confidence in them.

Since 2006, Hifi has helped scores of local designers and fashion professionals gain exposure through our events, membership program, and pop-up boutique. We provide resources for students and emerging designers, and collaborate with many key players from Hawaii and the international fashion industry.  Earlier this year, Hifi hosted a <a href=""http://www.hawaiifashion.org/pop-up"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">10-day pop-up fashion incubator event at Ala Moana </a>to test the concept of a permanent fashion incubator. The event was a huge success, with 18 local designers selling their work and over 25 fashion events, classes, and workshops on the calendar.  The event demonstrated how a physical space can bring the community together around fashion and gave us the confidence to move forward with our long-held goal of a permanent fashion incubator space in Honolulu.  </font></p>

The Hawaii Fashion Incubator (Hifi) is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a 501(c)(3) non-profit arts services organization. Since 2006, Hifi has helped scores of local designers and fashion professionals gain exposure through our events, membership program, and pop-up boutique. We provide resources for students and emerging designers, and collaborate with many key players from Hawaii and the international fashion industry.  Earlier this year, Hifi hosted a 10-day pop-up fashion incubator event at Ala Moana to test the concept of a permanent fashion incubator. The event was a huge success, with 18 local designers selling their work and over 25 fashion events, classes, and workshops on the calendar.  The event demonstrated how a physical space can bring the community together around fashion and gave us the confidence to move forward with our long-held goal of a permanent fashion incubator space in Honolulu.  
 
TODAY, WITH YOUR HELP, WE ARE REALIZING THAT DREAM.
 
We just got the keys to what will be Hawaii's first physical Fashion Incubator, at Ward Warehouse Shopping Center in the heart of Honolulu's shopping district. Demolition and construction has begun with a design team from Collaborative Design Workshop, Unleash Studio and Retail Therapy to develop 1,500 square feet into a
dynamic hub for fashion. In the plans: a retail space for local design & fashion events, a studio for classes & shared workspace, a library, photography studio, and more. As a supporter of Hifi, you can be among the first to see
the space in its raw form and weigh in on how we can help you fast track your project and together create a go-to spot
for fashion in Hawaii. 
 
By contributing to our funding campaign (and hopefully becoming a Hifi member), you'll benefit from all Hifi has to offer AND have a hand in writing the next chapter in HI
fashion.

<div style=""text-align: left;"">First of all, GRANI - is people: a  small team of jewelry and design enthusiasts, whose common ideas, interests and desires led to the formation of a small jewelry brand right in the the heart of Russia - Moscow</div>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">Once the idea of creating the first collection was born in March 2016, we asked ourselves two questions, answers to which have became basic principles and philosophy of the brand: </div>
<div> </div>
<div><b>""How can we make our environmental impact during the production?""</b></div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<ul><li style=""text-align: left;"">Precious metal mining can have a negative impact on environment - that is why we do not buy silver from mining companies, we use  100% recycled metals and natural stones only, ECO-friendly packaging materials, such as Italian linen, eco-suede and organic recycled paper products. We have also developed and continue to improve a concept of the most comfortable online-shoping platform, that enables you to try a jewelry on without visiting the store thus eliminating car trips and associated carbon emissions, saving on electricity needed for store provision and saving your personal time that you can now spend for the benefit of nature.</li></ul>

Every packaging material (linen, eco-suede) is also hard to find in a good quality, that is why we order 100% linen and a high-quality eco-suede from Italy - then every pouch and cloth is sewn by hand in our studio</li></ul>

</div></div>","Who We Are
First of all, GRANI - is people: a  small team of jewelry and design enthusiasts, whose common ideas, interests and desires led to the formation of a small jewelry brand right in the the heart of Russia - Moscow
 

www.grani-store.com
 
Once the idea of creating the first collection was born in March 2016, we asked ourselves two questions, answers to which have became basic principles and philosophy of the brand: 
 
""How can we make our environmental impact during the production?""
 

Precious metal mining can have a negative impact on environment - that is why we do not buy silver from mining companies, we use  100% recycled metals and natural stones only, ECO-friendly packaging materials, such as Italian linen, eco-suede and organic recycled paper products. We have also developed and continue to improve a concept of the most comfortable online-shoping platform, that enables you to try a jewelry on without visiting the store thus eliminating car trips and associated carbon emissions, saving on electricity needed for store provision and saving your personal time that you can now spend for the benefit of nature.
 

""What does a woman want from a jewelry?""


Every woman wants to have a unique piece of jewelry created especially for her rather than pay for mass-market products - that is why we design our jewelry in an unusual, but elegant way
 



 

Every woman wants to be sure, that her jewelry is worth it's price - that is why we use only precious recycled metals and natural semi-precious stones. We attach great importance to the quality of our jewelry, that is why every model is produced by hand and thoroughly tested before shipping



 


Every woman wants to choose - that is why we create our each model in two colors: Silver (sterling silver) and Black (ruthenium plated sterling silver - one of the most durable finishing ever)



Finally, every woman wants to try a jewelry on before buying it even from online stores - that is why we have developed an iOS and Android Virtual Fitting Room app that you can download  from App Store or Google Play using links below or by a search request for ""Grani Jewelry""





 



Why Do We Need Your Support?
Despite the fact that the first collection and our Virtual Fitting Room app is ready, we still need support for the following:
materials for further production of the first collection  (wax, silver, stones, packaging materials) - every model is created and processed by hand using recycled precious metals and rare semi-precious stones - as we do not work with mining companies it is quite hard to find a good metal that is worth its price and a good stone even for a small ring. Every packaging material (linen, eco-suede) is also hard to find in a good quality, that is why we order 100% linen and a high-quality eco-suede from Italy - then every pouch and cloth is sewn by hand in our studio

materials for developing and producing the collection of alternative stones - we want you to choose not only from silver colors, but different stones as well

developing more realistic Virtual Fitting Room app that will help bring a virtual process closer to the real one

 
What We Can Offer
We offer a 30% discount for our jewelry for a limited time of the campaign - 30 days and 35% discount for our Valentine's Day perks.
Each piece comes with a hand-sewn 100% Italian pouch and eco-suede cloth.
Every pouch is packed in a safe bubble-envelope for international delivery.
Each perk includes a free international delivery with a postal tracking number.


Just pick a piece and color you are in love with and for rings and bracelets - the size using one of our size charts bellow. Size options for necklaces chains: from 15 to 20 inches.


If you did not find you size in the chat - just specify it in the order!

Risks & Challenges 
The one and only risk that can appear - is order overfulfillment plan. That is why for those bakers, who have backed after us had reached the 7 000$ goal -  the delivery will be slightly increased, still we will try to deliver every piece even earlier!

<p><b>Hi I’m Monica
and I’m a Costume Designer!</b></p>
<p>As
a young child, I taught myself how to sew on an old in-table Singer that my
mother thought was broken. I fixed it and started making all kinds of costumes,
for myself, my Barbie’s, and my friends. I made two out of three of my prom
dresses (yes… I went to prom three times…) one of which I created my own
pattern <i>without</i> the knowledge I later obtained in college. I ended up pursuing
fashion design when I attended the Fashion Institute of Design &amp;
Merchandising, and then followed my Associates degree with a Bachelor of Science
in Business Management. This past year I had a fantastic experience styling the
costumes for a short film called <i>Olivia Martha Ilse</i>, which has successfully
gone on to multiple film festivals here in the US as well as in Europe (Cannes!) </p>
<p>My campaign here on IndieGoGo is simply to
help raise the startup funds needed to construct beautiful, high quality
costumes under the name Boxcar Boutique, LLC, for all the history lovers out
there! This venture is incredibly important to me because creating costumes
that correlate with different times in history is a true passion of mine and
what’s better than doing what you love?! My goal for the first year with your
generous contributions is to create, finish, and sell 10-15 full garments. Your contribution will help me create one-of-a-kind
garments for women who attend historical conferences, are involved in reenactments, and who just like to go all out for Halloween! <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With your help, I also have plans to design
historically inspired gowns for special occasions, such as weddings. I've already acquired two bridal clients!</span></p>
<p><b>Let’s break it down…</b></p>
<p>In order to get the ball rolling, I will need
$20,000 for <u>the <i>first year</i></u>.
This amount includes many things essential to the success and operation of
Boxcar Boutique: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Rent</b> ($4,000)
     I have already put my time and money into acquiring the workshop I’ll be
     building out of, I just need the funds to continue paying the rent!</li>
<li>
<b>Equipment </b>($2000) I have an at-home sewing machine, a cheap-o iron, and a size 4 dress form [on a terrible stand...], however in order to achieve the results I desire for my garments I will need to upgrade to the industry standards! This will cover a new machine, a gravity iron/steamer, and a full body form in a larger size to better serve my market.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Materials</b> ($4,000)
     I will be using high quality fabrics and each garment will need a
     considerable amount of material.</li>
<li>
<b>Notions and embellishments</b> ($1000)
     The gowns of the 18<sup>th</sup> through the early 20<sup>th</sup> century
     are heavily embellished and most require notions such as beads, ribbons, eyelets, hooks,
     busks, boning, Etc.</li>
<li>
<b>Draping/drafting materials</b> ($1000)
     I start all of my pieces from the form, so I need the right materials to
     drape and draft accurate patterns. This means LOTS of muslin, interfacing,
     canvas, paper, and manila. </li>
<li>
<b>Time/labor</b> ($5000)
     I would like to pay myself at least something for the extra time and labor
     that goes into creating such elaborate outfits. This will also make it
     possible <i>to eat</i> if I need to put the sale of my garments back into the
     business (in the case I don’t sell all 15.)</li>
<li>
<b>Website &amp; business cards</b> ($200)
     This is the amount needed to secure a domain name, host the website, as well as
     purchase business cards to get the Boxcar Boutique’s name out there!</li>
<li>
<b>Government fees</b> ($900)
     This is set aside for the fees required to register an LLC with the state

<p></p></div>","Hi I’m Monica
and I’m a Costume Designer!
As
a young child, I taught myself how to sew on an old in-table Singer that my
mother thought was broken. I fixed it and started making all kinds of costumes,
for myself, my Barbie’s, and my friends. I made two out of three of my prom
dresses (yes… I went to prom three times…) one of which I created my own
pattern without the knowledge I later obtained in college. I ended up pursuing
fashion design when I attended the Fashion Institute of Design &
Merchandising, and then followed my Associates degree with a Bachelor of Science
in Business Management. This past year I had a fantastic experience styling the
costumes for a short film called Olivia Martha Ilse, which has successfully
gone on to multiple film festivals here in the US as well as in Europe (Cannes!) 
My campaign here on IndieGoGo is simply to
help raise the startup funds needed to construct beautiful, high quality
costumes under the name Boxcar Boutique, LLC, for all the history lovers out
there! This venture is incredibly important to me because creating costumes
that correlate with different times in history is a true passion of mine and
what’s better than doing what you love?! My goal for the first year with your
generous contributions is to create, finish, and sell 10-15 full garments. Your contribution will help me create one-of-a-kind
garments for women who attend historical conferences, are involved in reenactments, and who just like to go all out for Halloween! With your help, I also have plans to design
historically inspired gowns for special occasions, such as weddings. I've already acquired two bridal clients!
Let’s break it down…
In order to get the ball rolling, I will need
$20,000 for the first year.
This amount includes many things essential to the success and operation of
Boxcar Boutique: 


Rent ($4,000)
     I have already put my time and money into acquiring the workshop I’ll be
     building out of, I just need the funds to continue paying the rent!

Equipment ($2000) I have an at-home sewing machine, a cheap-o iron, and a size 4 dress form [on a terrible stand...], however in order to achieve the results I desire for my garments I will need to upgrade to the industry standards! This will cover a new machine, a gravity iron/steamer, and a full body form in a larger size to better serve my market.


Materials ($4,000)
     I will be using high quality fabrics and each garment will need a
     considerable amount of material.

Notions and embellishments ($1000)
     The gowns of the 18th through the early 20th century
     are heavily embellished and most require notions such as beads, ribbons, eyelets, hooks,
     busks, boning, Etc.

Draping/drafting materials ($1000)
     I start all of my pieces from the form, so I need the right materials to
     drape and draft accurate patterns. This means LOTS of muslin, interfacing,
     canvas, paper, and manila. 

Time/labor ($5000)
     I would like to pay myself at least something for the extra time and labor
     that goes into creating such elaborate outfits. This will also make it
     possible to eat if I need to put the sale of my garments back into the
     business (in the case I don’t sell all 15.)

Website & business cards ($200)
     This is the amount needed to secure a domain name, host the website, as well as
     purchase business cards to get the Boxcar Boutique’s name out there!

Government fees ($900)
     This is set aside for the fees required to register an LLC with the state
     of California. It's an annual fee.

Marketing ($500) I have to get my name out there somehow, and believe it or not, those Facebook campaigns aren't free. I'll also be looking into other means of marketing.

Accounting service ($1000) Let's face it, I'm no accountant. I need to hire a professional! I want to do this right, so I must to pay for the right services!

Miscellaneous ($500).
     For any unexpected costs that may arise. And the do.

These amounts are totals needed for the
whole first year, and I plan on selling each garment for $900-$2000
depending of course on the varying amount of time/labor, detail, and fabrics
used. The level of quality I plan on producing requires many years of practice
and skill and I have 18 years under my belt (""she's so young, how's that possible?"" I know right! It helps when you start as a 6 year old..) 
While I am hoping to fully reach my goal, the fees needed

them, however, I can’t make an 18th
century Polonaise gown without material! I will assure you though, that any
contributions made will be put to use for the advancement of Boxcar Boutique, LLC!
Here’s
what you’ll get!

There will be a semi-wide array of perks for
all my contributors! I am a seamstress so most of my perks are garment related;
for the most part I’ll make you anything you want! I can make doll’s clothes if
you need a child’s gift. I’ll even help out with any odd jobs you might need done

We are And Our Mission</i></b></p>
<p>Beautiful Underneath, LLC is a small in-home lingerie boutique.  Danielle and Kelly bring their product into their customer homes whether for a one-on-one fitting, a small intimate bridal shower, or a party in their home with all of their closest friends.  </p>
<p>Their mission aims to be the premier intimate apparel and swimwear store in Oregon. Customers will enhance their silhouette through accurate fittings for comfort, fit, shape, support and style.  While providing an atmosphere for the customer that is comfortable, personable and enjoyable.  </p>
<p>The desire to open a specialty lingerie boutique was born
as the founders of Beautiful Underneath, Danielle and Kelly, suffered from discomfort in locally ill-fitted bras.  They were amazed at the immediate difference they felt after accurately being fit at the nearest lingerie boutique that was an hours drive from Salem.  They soon were educated on the proper fitting bra and how it can trim the figure visually by five pounds, gives confidence, and for larger women, helps relieve severe back pain and migraines caused by improperly or unsupported breast tissue.  So impacted, the heartbeat of Beautiful Underneath was started as the founders understood the need.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The need is great.  Everyone they talked to in town agreed Salem lacks a lingerie boutique that allows every woman the ability to find what she needs, not just those that fit into ""popular sizes"".  They anxiously await to fill this void by opening the doors of this project to serve the women of the Mid-Willamette Valley with Beautiful Underneath's services and products.  Supporting them today will help open the doors sooner to a mobile fashion truck, which plans to grow into a brick and mortar boutique within a couple of years.  This is where you can come in by supporting Beautiful Underneath as they take their first steps financially and through word of mouth advertising.</span><br/></p>
<p>If you can’t financially support us, can you help us spread

<div>Here is our short story:</div>
<div>It all started some time ago in the buses of Los Angeles, Domo was commuting a lot and noticed working people, students, regular citizens...commuting and just struggling with keeping awake and struggling with how and where to put their heads. So as he was struggling as well.                                                          </div>

<div>

Our Story



Hi Everyone!
We are two open minded, humble and creative ( at least we think that ) friends, we love to travel, imagine, dream and that is why we came up with our idea and eventually our product.
Here is our short story:
It all started some time ago in the buses of Los Angeles, Domo was commuting a lot and noticed working people, students, regular citizens...commuting and just struggling with keeping awake and struggling with how and where to put their heads. So as he was struggling as well.                                                          




He then thought of what he thought was a great the idea. A helmet! Helmet that you will stick up to a window ( same way you stick a towel hanger on bathroom tails ) or velcro it around the pole!


He met Mark and told him the story! The reaction was dreadful! Mark cracked up and started heavily laughing.  He told Domo: ""Are you out of your mind?  Who in the World would buy that?"". They then started cracking up and started throwing jokes how people would just use The Helmet and would just recharge themselves wherever needed, like cell phones.  However the seed stayed in their heads.  On their numerous travels, Mark would usually drive, Domo was a passenger.  That day Domo was wearing a hoodie, and was whining about his helmet, they were talking
       
AND WALLLAAAA!!! THE IDEA WAS BORN!!! Why don't we put some cushions on the side of the hood!  Where?  On the ears! So it subtly dampens the noise down as well!  But we need something more!  What? How? Where?  Why don't we hang more cushions, pillows on the lace of the hood. Why don't we! They went to first arts and crafts store, ripped the hood, filled it up with polyester pillow material, they hanged couple of cushions on the lace of the hood and LOGZ HOODIE WAS BORN!!!    



Where are We now, What We need and What You get 


After uncountable uses and tests of our prototype and after detailed search for the best material, we were just able to complete the production of couple of hundreds high quality fleece LogZ hoodies.  Hoodies are ready for IMMEDIATE delivery ( INCLUDING THIS HOLIDAY SEASON!!!! ) however we would like to get to the next level.  So we are reaching out to You.

We will use Your contributions to fund our future production ( we are in co-operation with very well known garment manufacturer! ), we want to fund more hoodie collections, we want to produce more LogZ products that we already have ideas and sketches, we will introduce LogZ hoodie to schools, colleges, sport teams, travel companies, musicians, actors, every day people, whoever needs sleep, whoever needs that little power nap to recharge and continue with a day....We will include you in our process, we will listen to your suggestions, we will make your travel, commute, chilling in the lounge before tennis match or exam, movie or beach day, watching your kid playing a game on the bleachers with your loved one......a LogZ experience. You will work, play, perform, feel better. 
We want to develop a LogZ brand!
ON THE RIGHT YOU CAN ORDER OUR HOODIES, SELECT ONE OF OUR FEATURED PERKS OR CONTRIBUTE YOUR OWN AMOUNT ACCORDING TO YOUR WISHES AND CAPABILITIES ( ON THE RIGHT ABOVE PERKS)!  THANK YOU!

Features and benefits:

LogZ's unique head and ear cushions give your head and neck extra comfort and in a subtling manner decrease the noises around you.  Patented detachable hanging pillows give you additional comfort and you can position them in the most suitable places for your complete satisfaction.  LogZ hoodie is made of fleece, soft and comfy material that will keep you warm and cozy wherever you are.  There is another little secret cushion on the hoodie. The whole process will develop a unique experience that we call - LOGZING OUT!

Cold Weather.  Perfect for wearing over and under any type of outerwear. ___________________________ WE SHIP WORLDWIDE___________________________ Cashmere & High-Quality Cashmere Cashmere is a natural fiber that comes from the soft undercoat of cashmere goats. Cashmere goats produce this undercoat to be warm in the winter but shed them in the spring. When the fibers are processed and spun into yarns, they can be knit or woven into a luxurious material used for making garments.Cashmere is naturally soft, warm, breathable and light. Unlike synthetic fabrics, cashmere does not trap moisture. Moreover, cashmere is much softer, lighter and more insulating than cotton or wool.   Cashmere fibers are classified into Grades A, B and C, based on the length and width of the fibers. The longest and thinnest fibers produce the highest quality fabric. Etugen Cashmere uses Grade A cashmere in its products.Garments made of lower quality cashmere using inferior technology are cheaper and are prone to excessive stretching and pilling.   Mongolia is the world’s leading supplier of cashmere, supplying 40% of the world’s cashmere. Rural nomadic herders raise cashmere goats across the vast steppes of Mongolia following a thousands-year-old tradition of nomadic animal husbandry.Mongolian cashmere goats produce the finest quality cashmere because they are raised in a unique climate characterized by hot summers and extremely cold winters. Annual temperatures range from 102°F (39°C) to -40°F (-40°C) in Mongolia.___________________________ Cashmere Supply Chain Luxury brands that produce cashmere garments source their cashmere from Mongolia.Unfortunately, most of Mongolia’s cashmere gets exported as raw fibers instead of finished garments. This means Mongolia does not benefit from the value created in the production and sale of cashmere goods  Traditionally, high-quality pure cashmere garments have been very expensive. This is because cashmere passes 6-8 middle men, across 3-5 national borders before reaching end consumers in the form of finished products.Prices are inflated due to supply chain inefficiencies and wasteful spending by brands on expensive storefronts and excessive marketing campaigns.The industry’s practices are unfair to the consumer, who need to pay inflated prices for decent quality products. It is also unfair to the humble Mongolian nomadic herders who supply that cashmere.  Etugen Cashmere brings a solution to these problems by producing finished products within Mongolia, bypassing the middlemen and reaching consumers directly.  ___________________________ Our Philosophy Etugen Cashmere’s definition of quality goes beyond high-quality material and workmanship. Our products are made with a natural biodegradable material, obtained cruelty-free from goats grazing freely across the vast steppes of Mongolia. They are made in a Mongolian manufacturing facility, where we know workers are treated with dignity, provided healthy working conditions and paid living wages.Our brand name Etugen Cashmere originates from the old Mongolian expression Etügen Ekh, meaning Mother Nature. It stands for our commitment to protecting the environment and nurturing life on earth.Love, respect and awe of Mother Nature have been integral parts of nomadic Mongolian culture for thousands of years. As a Mongolian company, we live by those values. As Mentioned By Click to read Italia Innovation's Feature on Etugen Cashmere___________________________ MONGOLIA Mongolia is a Central Asian country located between Russia and China.

Confronted with the consequences of breast cancer up close, I got lucky, breast-conserving surgery, but what if it had been a breast amputation, which options would I have. Google search, a lot. Talking to women, breast cancer survivors,<strong> how external breast prostheses change your live.</strong> What stuck was  the feeling I got then. Like yes there are products, prostheses available but men are they heavy and warm and sweaty and chafing the skin. Lot's of them on the market but <strong>all look-a-likes,</strong> confection made, same materials same techniques so <strong>no real choice for women</strong>!  <strong>This had to change!</strong> New ideas/design, new technologies, new materials, online platform, cosmetic device - why not.</p>

As someone who has worked in the jewelry financing business for 28 years, I've seen many good people who were ready to make a lifetime promise with an engagement or wedding ring get turned away from a store with no other option. For some, receiving credit from any jewelry company is not an option due to their financial credit history. To me, it was unacceptable and heartbreaking to see these people unable to get the ring they desired for their loved one because of inadequate responsible financing options.



Zephyr Diamond is a start-up, online fine jewelry store with a vision to become
the world’s solution for engagement and bridal ring credit financing. With the
utilization of our inclusive financing method, we believe this is possible.

You can take them to your local optometrist and have your prescription put in with ease.  We want you to have only the very best, that's why we engrave a subtle reminder to ""Live your Dream"". It's the details that matter, and we think it is the perfect finishing touch.  We have worked really hard on making a high quality pair of glasses, but also a way to protect them. The William Painter hard case is custom built for The Empire. It fits snuggly and doesn't shake around when moving the case.",63.0,2,"4 Campaigns

<p>Unlike some cheaper shields made overseas, the AG Shield has proudly been designed, manufactured, and assembled in the USA. </p>

<h3><strong>It is crafted to be lightweight, durable, and sweat resistant.</strong></h3>

<p>Our ultimate hope is that you will never have to use it. But if you do, you can rest easy knowing that you are protected by a high-quality American-made piece of safety equipment.</p>

<p>The AG Shield is an innovative new breed of personal ballistics protection that has one key role – to save your life.</p>
<p>We have created a <strong>lightweight</strong> <strong>bullet-resistant </strong>shield that can be worn <strong>by everyone, everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>Traditional bulletproof vests are effective, but they tend to be heavy and bulky. This may not be a problem for trained officers, military personnel, and bodyguards, but it’s less practical for your average human.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Made in the USA, the AG Shield is the world’s first fully concealable bulletproof vest that can be worn by everybody.
In addition, it can be used in multiple ways, allowing users to adapt to dangerous situations.
 



 
Unlike some cheaper shields made overseas, the AG Shield has proudly been designed, manufactured, and assembled in the USA. 
 
It is crafted to be lightweight, durable, and sweat resistant.
 
Our ultimate hope is that you will never have to use it. But if you do, you can rest easy knowing that you are protected by a high-quality American-made piece of safety equipment.
Think of the AG Shield like your personal bodyguard – only it doesn’t cost hundreds of dollars per day like a human bodyguard.
Whatever you do, leave nothing to chance.
Back the AG Shield today and help us bring this essential device to market. 
 


The AG Shield is an innovative new breed of personal ballistics protection that has one key role – to save your life.
We have created a lightweight bullet-resistant shield that can be worn by everyone, everywhere.
Traditional bulletproof vests are effective, but they tend to be heavy and bulky. This may not be a problem for trained officers, military personnel, and bodyguards, but it’s less practical for your average human. 


 
Weighing in at just under 4lbs, this vest can be used by all genders and body sizes.
.
 
The lightweight and slimline build make it easy and discreet to carry in a backpack or bag, whether at school, at work, or on the road (and yes, it’s airport-friendly).

 

Each vest comes with two removable shields that can also be used independently. Each shield features a quick-access hand strap on the rear for easier grip as you adapt to dangerous situations.
Store it in your backpack, your locker, your front hallway, or in your car. You never know where danger will strike. 

In moments of terror, preparation is everything. 
 


 
Thanks to the unique design, the AG Shield can be carried in multiple ways, allowing you to adapt to high-stress situations quickly and adeptly:

Harness – The double-sided harness allows you to wear the shield over your body as you would a traditional bulletproof vest, giving you hands-free protection.


Handheld – Each of the two shields features quick-access hand straps securely mounted on the rear, allowing you to rapidly deploy and hold your protection like a traditional shield.

Stowed – With a slimline design, the shield can also be stored discreetly in a backpack for easier transportation and quick access. It also turns a regular backpack into a ballistic shield, for instant protection in school or workplace shootings. 

 

 
With the AG Shield, you can go anywhere with confidence, knowing that science is on your side.
AG Shield is made with Kevlar® by DuPont™ – 
the most respected name in ballistics – and has NIJ Level IIIA certification. 

 
This certification means that it has been independently tested and confirmed to offer the highest level of protection available in soft body armor products. In fact, most personal body armor worn by law enforcement is only rated II or IIA.
To put this in real terms, this anti-ballistic material is resistant to nearly all handgun ammunition including

.22SR,
.22LR
.25,
.32,
.38,
.380,
.357 Magnum,
9mm Full Metal Jacket,
.40 Cal.,
.45cal. and
.44 Magnum

 
It is also stab, slice, and puncture-resistant. 
 
No matter how they come at you, they won’t get through the AG Shield.

</h3><p>On Thursday, June 26th, our Austin City Council, dismissing any and all concerns of rail advocates and the community, voted 7-0 to approve the Project Connect urban rail plan.

More than $400 million in mostly highway intersection projects were bundled with the rail package. Council meets again on August 7, 2014 to consider bond language for the November election.

Austinites have formally endorsed a light rail   alignment in the <b>
Guadalupe-North Lamar </b>corridor. At twice the jobs, twice the ridership, and 17% more people NOW than is estimated to live on the Project Connect route in 2030, <b>Guadalupe-North Lamar is the city's strongest corridor</b>.

This is a product of desperation, of a siege mentality. The acts illustrate how weak and indefensible the Project Connect plan is. The public has been told that there is no plan b in no uncertain terms, ""Rail or Fail."" But, the conduct of council demonstrates that, not only is there a bright future for urban rail after November, that future is just not theirs to control anymore.

<p></p><h3>Why Did We Have to Bring Up Money?</h3><p>We are an opposition campaign.

The materials for our pants are mostly from second hand or charity shops in Riga and Vecumnieki. Some pants are donated to us, from our friends or customers. 


We are proud of our first great fashion show ""Uzins"" in Riga in 27 June 2014. Show was reflected in Latvian media and caused
     great interest in local society.

For
     last couple years we have participated in different markets and festivals. One of festivals we have participated for last three years is
     “Positivus”, the biggest music festival in Baltics.
We have
     actively worked on our publicity these last two years and now information
     and articles about Ulmanpants are published in women
     and business magazines, stories about our products are
     shown on television and they have been topic of different radioprogramms, etc.
     Also Ulmanpants are used to dress TV faces and celebrities.
In spring 2015 we had great photo shot with by great photographer Arturs Kondrats and with great models-famous basketball player and boxer Kaspars Kambala and TV face Marta Selecka.



What is our plan


Our main goal is to expand our production, giving possibility to offer full time job to seamstress.  It is very important
to us to make our product locally, but we are eager to offer our product
internationally!



At
start of  October we will take part
in international design fair Design Isle 2015 in Riga which for the third
time will gather together more than 190 designers from all over the
Baltic States showing good local design.






This year we plan to
develop new product – coat made from blankets. 
In due time we plan to sell
our products in upcycling shops and fashion boutiques in Berlin, Tallinn  and
Oslo. We have already contacted some of possible retailers there. However we plan to expand our production by offering regular collections in  shops. 
Having photo shoots of products, having
promotional activities, and more and more being showed in international
society. Products will end up in our Etsy shop.

<h1>What's with the MVMT?</h1>
<p>Our team sought out to create MVMT because of our passion for watches and desire to cut out the brand inflation and retail markup of popular name brands.  We got frustrated paying hundreds of dollars for name brand watches, knowing they only cost a fraction of the price to make.  We have spent the past year working with leaders in the industry to come up with an affordable, stylish looking watch collection that we know everyone will love.</p>
<p>When designing this watch collection, we made sure of THREE details:</p>

<li>A minimalist look that could be worn in a casual or professional setting.</li>
<li>The highest quality materials.</li>
<li>Offering the watches at a price less than half what our competitor's cost.</li>

In short, this is the conversation; this is a space where people are talking about what fashion is, and what that means to each of us. Toronto Arts and Fashion Week has become respected in Toronto as the place to explore alternative fashion ideas and the media is taking notice.

This is the venue where we need to be raising these questions, increasing the focus on this dialogue, and this is a venue that is providing exactly that same benefit to a large number of very talented and noteworthy alternative fashion artists; people looking to have the same conversation. By supporting Toronto Arts and Fashion Week we bring our backing and message to support the event. </span></span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-family: Century, serif;""><span style=""font-size: large;""> Part of the money we are trying to raise is our admission cost to Toronto Arts and Fashion Week, which is a very reasonable $600.00 for 10 looks.

However, these studios are the face of the future, the face of a positive change.</span></span></p>

How you take part is up to you. At the very least we'd like you to think about what beauty, fashion and clothing means to you. We want you to think about the question of why the media definition of beauty is more valid than your definition. We want you to think about expressing yourself through clothing and why the idea of being yourself is still scary to some people. We want you to think about where your clothing comes from, the ethics of creating the clothing you wear as well as the effect of wearing it.</span></span></p>

So What?
 Hello from Cinched Tight and thank you for considering our funding initiative. We are trying to raise $750 in funds to offset some of the costs of our upcoming appearance at TORONTO ARTS & FASHION WEEK 2013. We are a boutique studio creating Corsets, Latex and Lingerie and we will be bringing a collection to the stage on April 27th 2013 as part of this annual alternative fashion event.
 
 And right about now you are asking yourself, “so what, why is this important?” 
 
 We believe that this is important for three key reasons, and we hope that once we've explained a bit, you'll agree enough to fund us with a small donation, or by sharing the campaign.
 
#1: Clothing is Important
We may not think about it deeply every day (or we might) but clothing really is important. What you wear shapes how others see you, and how you see yourself. In effect what you wear shapes who you appear to be, and how you are treated in this world.
 
 We believe that you need to celebrate your shape. We believe that dignity, freedom of expression, self-esteem and even your safety are directly affected by what you wear, and we believe that we can create clothing that helps improve the conversation we are having about these ideas.


It's still considered acceptable that a woman's safety is tied to her choice of clothing.


It's still commonplace for women with figures that fall outside of the accepted norm to hate, or even harm themselves.


Society seems to agree that beauty is the domain of the young.

 
 These things need to change. We don't believe that we alone can change these ideas, but we do believe that by partnering our designs with an event like Toronto Arts and Fashion Week we can continue pushing these conversations to the front page.
 
#2 We Need A Stage – We Need This Stage
 This conversation needs a venue and the best venue for a conversation involving fashion is a fashion show. We couldn't be more excited to have the unique opportunity to return to Toronto Arts and Fashion Week this year after being recognized by the Toronto Standard as one of the 5 most outrageous moments of 2012. 
 Toronto Arts and Fashion Week, as the name suggests, is a week long event featuring designers, photographers and artists with a focus on fashion. In short, this is the conversation; this is a space where people are talking about what fashion is, and what that means to each of us. Toronto Arts and Fashion Week has become respected in Toronto as the place to explore alternative fashion ideas and the media is taking notice. Last year the event was covered by most, if not all, of the major Canadian media outlets with a fashion editorial desk.
 
 So Toronto Arts and Fashion Week represents a win win for Cinched Tight. This is the venue where we need to be raising these questions, increasing the focus on this dialogue, and this is a venue that is providing exactly that same benefit to a large number of very talented and noteworthy alternative fashion artists; people looking to have the same conversation. By supporting Toronto Arts and Fashion Week we bring our backing and message to support the event. 
 Part of the money we are trying to raise is our admission cost to Toronto Arts and Fashion Week, which is a very reasonable $600.00 for 10 looks. More mainstream events such as L'Oreal Fashion Week charge thousands of dollars, making those events simply unattainable for the forward thinking smaller studios like ourselves. However, these studios are the face of the future, the face of a positive change.
 Our admission fee covers advertising and administration fees for the event as well as fees associated with the fashion show itself. Again, by aligning ourselves with, and supporting, Toronto Arts and Fashion Week we are able to bring our message to a much wider audience while making it possible for many small studios to reach that same audience. Everybody wins.
 
#3 We Can't Do It Alone
This is a conversation that takes many voices. This year we have been honoured to be supported by 10 fantastic models, each of whom bring a unique beauty to the stage, each defying traditional standards. We have created brand new exciting looks for this event and we are in the process of building these looks in our studio. 
 
 And we have the incredible venue of Toronto Arts and Fashion Week.
 
 All we need now is you. We need you to get involved in this conversation. How you take part is up to you. At the very least we'd like you to think about what beauty, fashion and clothing means to you. We want you to think about the question of why the media definition of beauty is more valid than your definition. We want you to think about expressing yourself through clothing and why the idea of being yourself is still scary to some people. We want you to think about where your clothing comes from, the ethics of creating the clothing you wear as well as the effect of wearing it.
 
 And we want you to join the Celebration. Whether you wear something from our studio, or not, find a piece in your wardrobe that makes you feel great and wear it with pride. Celebrate your shape, celebrate the way that makes you feel. Allow yourself to feel great about the way you look today. And if you can do that, if you agree with our message and think it needs to be heard, then we need you to help us make our runway show at Toronto Arts and Fashion Week this year a reality. In fact, if you agree with our message then you need you to help make this show possible. If you choose to support our funding drive this is what you'll be buying into:


You'll help with our costs for fabrics materials and R&D time on the new collection


You'll help cover our admission costs for this event which will cover Hair and Make-up for the night of the event as well as advertising, venue rental and administration fees for the event. Many of these fees also help our fellow artists in the alternative fashion community.


An important message about who we are as a community, what we believe and how we treat each other


The fantastic feeling of helping a cause you believe in, and joining in the celebration.

 
What You Get
Every contribution to our campaign is much needed funding and an essential statement that you agree with our message, that clothing can help shape a compassionate, dignified, safe and beautiful future for all of us. 
 If you can take that last step of funding our event, we want to thank you as much as we can so we have created a series of perks that we hope will say thank you and be rewarding. Please know that the biggest perk you get from funding us is the chance to help us bring change with our mission and the work our studio does to create ethically funded clothing that dares to Celebrate Your Shape.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Robin Shumays and I am the founder and designer of hennaflower. hennaflower is a unique couture party dress line with a fun, flirty ethnic edge. This campaign is so that you can help me relaunch my line and present a new collection at <strong><a href=""https://http//www.afwny.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Africa Fashion Week</a></strong> in NYC in July!</p>
<p>I’ve always been crafty and I've always been someone who liked to make things pretty! My mom taught me to crochet when I was 4 years old and I started knitting when I was 8. By age 10 I started sewing. Back then I didn’t really take it seriously; it was just a way to make clothes for my dolls. I didn’t think about becoming a designer until 2008. I decided to take sewing lessons from a local designer, the very awesome Sumie Tachibana. Sumie is a super encouraging teacher and friend. She organized a fashion show in early 2009 and invited her students to participate and design a piece for the show. I made a beautiful gown made from silk and a gorgeous vintage Indian sari. Having it walk down the runway was one of the greatest thrills of my life at that point. To my surprise, my dress got picked up by several local fashion blogs. I knew then that becoming a dress design was my passion and my calling.</p>
<p>One thing I didn't mention in my video is that I'm a Middle Eastern Dancer. I started dancing in 1997. I've also studied some Indian Dance and singing. Because of that, I’m heavily influenced by Indian, middle eastern and African culture and textiles. I officially ‘launched’ hennaflower in 2010, with a collection that was bollywood meets old Hollywood. Shortly after that I took a break to become a mommy to my sweet daughter Mehrunnisa.</p>
<p>Now I’m back and looking to relaunch hennaflower with a inspired collection that marries Africa and French can-can dancers! Dance is never far behind in my thinking! :)</p>
<p>Your contributions will go towards the entrance fee for the fashion show, fabric and notions to finish the collection, new photos, a new website and promotional materials in preparation for the show. In return, you get some super cool perks noted to the right... --&gt;</p>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, that's ok! Please just spread the word by posting the link to this campaign on your twitter facebook page or mailing list. :)</p>

<h3>Origins of GLOD</h3>

<p><strong>GLOD, is originated from the Danish word glød, meaning glow</strong>. This evocative glow unfolds a vista of infinite inspiration about light to us. Light, as one of the most important elements in Hygge, the Danish way to live well, not only creates an ineffable atmosphere and experience to all of us but also inspires our creations from the very beginning.</p>
<p>We develop the aesthetics of GLOD by capturing the <strong>journey of light</strong>, using curves, points and lines, the contrast between abstract and tangible shapes at the serendipitous glowing moment.</p>
<p>We illuminate the glow of GLOD by embracing the <strong>notion of aura</strong> and mythical <strong>power from galaxy wonders</strong>.</p>
<p>The icon Ø in our logo encapsulates the very essence from glowing light in the Danish spirit of Hygge, meanwhile, as a cosmic symbol, embodies the mythical glow from the nebula.</p>
<p>Here at GLOD, we hope through vivifying our design to <strong>ignite the soul-renewing aura power</strong> inside each wearer.</p>

<p>The <u>radiant beams</u> design sends out melting warmth to awaken the passionate heart, lighting a path for the imagination to traverse between reality and fantasy.</p>
<p>Pieces with dynamic curves epitomize the minimalist aesthetic derived from <u>dancing light</u>, as elvish as aurora, its buoyant hues can only be seen by luck.</p>
<p>Taking flight from <u>glistening flares</u>, pieces convey shimmering movements through circular geometric forms in layers, whimsically connecting optical space in visual illusion to project a sense of romantic modern chic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Collection 2: Be Aura</strong></p>

<p>Each aura color presents a <strong>distinctive healing rhythm</strong> in the dangling charm, like a blazing nebula extending its glow across the galaxy, and bestowing them with youthful energy and splendor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Collection 3: Be Signature</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533109522/tdko2rskqjlrk990myhc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Alighting the intoxicating motions of glow, this collection celebrates <strong>the signature motif Ø</strong> from our logo.</p>
<p>The motif Ø ignites the reverie with the allure of celestial orbit in eclectic circular composition and <strong>lyrical movement</strong>, echoing the curiosity of star atlas and planet axis silhouette in our hearts, lifting the imagination beyond earthly beauty.</p>
<p>The triumphant radiance from within comes to life as the immaculate freshwater pearl juxtaposed at the center, uniting the graceful design to melt the hearts of wearers with futuristic and minimalistic touch.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Design Details</h3>

<p>We love new inspirations every day, so we want to create something special for you. Certain pieces are <strong>designed in a transformable way</strong>, they are more than a simple mix and match, but pieces for you to <strong>create your own aura</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>invincible rotation</strong> of the pieces conjures the perpetual energy of glowing, offering a glimpse into the secret of a mesmerizing transformation to convey a delicate balance between emotionality and rationality.</p>
<p><u><strong>Interplay of Multi-color Tones</strong></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533113699/vulix3tb943tearpxr03.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Jewelry crafting is an art form created by hands, eyes, and most importantly heart at the same time. Every detail in design is brought to life by our artisans with passion and love. Most of our artisans have spent years honing their art.

<p>We understand that price is always a concern for selecting a jewelry. But material cost shouldn’t be the main reason pushing you away from the piece.

<p>We carefully select the most affordable precious metal sterling silver, in its best quality, and plated it with 18K gold to give extra shine and durability. It looks as gorgeous as 18K gold, but cost much less, giving you another reason to make yourself radiant.</p>
<p>Chalcedony is the main material we use in Be Aura collection. It is one of the natural gems known for gentle personality and stable magnetic energy.

<p>Freshwater pearls are one of the most graceful, feminine and sophisticated material in jewelry design. We use it in Be Signature collection as the immaculate shine from it resembles the triumphant radiance we want to create in our design.</p>

</div></div>","Origins of GLOD

GLOD, is originated from the Danish word glød, meaning glow. This evocative glow unfolds a vista of infinite inspiration about light to us. Light, as one of the most important elements in Hygge, the Danish way to live well, not only creates an ineffable atmosphere and experience to all of us but also inspires our creations from the very beginning.
We develop the aesthetics of GLOD by capturing the journey of light, using curves, points and lines, the contrast between abstract and tangible shapes at the serendipitous glowing moment.
We illuminate the glow of GLOD by embracing the notion of aura and mythical power from galaxy wonders.
The icon Ø in our logo encapsulates the very essence from glowing light in the Danish spirit of Hygge, meanwhile, as a cosmic symbol, embodies the mythical glow from the nebula.
Here at GLOD, we hope through vivifying our design to ignite the soul-renewing aura power inside each wearer.
 

Perks















 
Meet the Inspiration
Collection 1: Be Light
Putting a halt to time, pieces are inspired by a serendipitous wander through radiant beams, dancing light, glistening flare, and captures the dreamy moment of glow to the poetically abstract details.
The radiant beams design sends out melting warmth to awaken the passionate heart, lighting a path for the imagination to traverse between reality and fantasy.
Pieces with dynamic curves epitomize the minimalist aesthetic derived from dancing light, as elvish as aurora, its buoyant hues can only be seen by luck.
Taking flight from glistening flares, pieces convey shimmering movements through circular geometric forms in layers, whimsically connecting optical space in visual illusion to project a sense of romantic modern chic.
 
Collection 2: Be Aura

Glowing in the deepest dark, this collection indulges in galaxy wonders to cast an enduring and irresistible spell of fantasy.
Deepening the effusive glow is the 7 aura color gems radiate in the charms. You can stack your own, layer your own and style your own by adding iconic mythical symbols and imaginary points and lines in your star chart.
Each aura color presents a distinctive healing rhythm in the dangling charm, like a blazing nebula extending its glow across the galaxy, and bestowing them with youthful energy and splendor.
 
Collection 3: Be Signature

Alighting the intoxicating motions of glow, this collection celebrates the signature motif Ø from our logo.
The motif Ø ignites the reverie with the allure of celestial orbit in eclectic circular composition and lyrical movement, echoing the curiosity of star atlas and planet axis silhouette in our hearts, lifting the imagination beyond earthly beauty.
The triumphant radiance from within comes to life as the immaculate freshwater pearl juxtaposed at the center, uniting the graceful design to melt the hearts of wearers with futuristic and minimalistic touch.
 
Design Details
Multi Wearing Design

We love new inspirations every day, so we want to create something special for you. Certain pieces are designed in a transformable way, they are more than a simple mix and match, but pieces for you to create your own aura.
Iconic Kinetic and Spin Design

The invincible rotation of the pieces conjures the perpetual energy of glowing, offering a glimpse into the secret of a mesmerizing transformation to convey a delicate balance between emotionality and rationality.
Interplay of Multi-color Tones

Sleek yet vivid, the enthralling resonance between yellow gold, white gold and rose gold resembles the varying shades created by the play of light in a transcendent glow.
 
Craftsmanship & Material

Jewelry crafting is an art form created by hands, eyes, and most importantly heart at the same time. Every detail in design is brought to life by our artisans with passion and love. Most of our artisans have spent years honing their art. They are the magicians to visualize the sketch into a piece with functional wearability in terms of size, weight, softness, smoothness and well fitted. And each piece from GLOD is produced in a sustainable and environmental-friendly way.
We understand that price is always a concern for selecting a jewelry. But material cost shouldn’t be the main reason pushing you away from the piece.

Risks & Challenges


Since the beginning of 2018, we have been working towards the launch. Same as any start-up companies, we face various risks and challenges along the road. We have poured our hearts into every single detail as we believe GLOD will glow.
One of the main challenges is how to actualize our design. Some of the pieces can be worn in multiple ways, some consists of kinetic and spinning parts and some are made of different color tones. All these design details need trial and error, and it took us longer time to modify and produce the best samples.
Another struggle is about the choice of materials. We never want to transfer the high material cost to the price that you are paying, thus we have used a lot of time, finding the best materials in terms of cost, color, and properties etc, to balance and present the design in its best aura.
Partnered with the best resources we have now, we expect the pieces to be ready and arrive in your hands during October – November 2018. If there are unforeseeable circumstances, whatever the case may be, you will hear it from us transparently with a solution.

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>My name is Patricia Freeman, Founder and Head Designer of Denim Blu. With your help,  I'm designing a new collection for women with curvier figures. The collection is named ""BEAUTIFUL YOU"". The Inspiration is the 1920's-30's Era. (The Great Gatspy/Roaring 20's with a modern chic flair of course!</p>
<p>My goal is to launch this trendy and much needed collection for women, show the line in New York at Fashion Week and also donate a percentage of the donations to benefit a charity.   <strong>Our goal is $50,000+</strong> however; we’re setting our “Indiegogo” goal at $25,000 because if we don’t reach our target, Indiegogo will take a much larger service fee.</p>
<p><em>On our 2013 Collection campaigns is to bring awareness to our charity causes in an effort to raise money for awareness and programs to educate the public.<strong> This year the causes we are supporting with our campaign will be TIGERLILY FOUNDATION &amp; UCAP. Our home page is a video of: Maimah Karma, founder of TigerLily, discussing services TigerLily Foundation offers, breast cancer support, education and advocacy  for women ages 15-40.</strong></em></p>
<p><span><strong>During this campaign we will post video, sketches and final product to up date you on our progress. They will be located in this home page and gallery page....Enjoy! (SKETCHES will be located at the GALLERY TAB)<br/></strong></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Denim Blu?</h3>
<p>We see that for women with curvier figures, the choices are very slim as far as clothing choices. It's a market that is untapped and looking for designers such as myself willing to make trendy, beautiful and classy clothing for women of ALL shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>After years of my own weight fluctuation, search for clothing that fit appropriately and hearing women state their desire more clothing choices, I thought maybe alot of other women feel like I do. So, I decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>I then started creating clothing that would fit women of all shapes and sizes appropriately AND it's trendy at the same time. No sagging in funny places and no unusual tightness in other places that should fit.</p>
<p>I've found a way have the samples made but the set back is to financially pay to produce and market the collection. I have all the right interns, factory and other professionals in place and would like to bring ""BEAUTIFUL YOU"" to the world.</p>
<h2>
<strong>With your help we can</strong>:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Give 10% of our campaign fund to charity.</li>
<li>Produce first samples of 20 new looks for the collection</li>
<li>Website and marketing</li>
<li>Event fees and show the collection in New York during fashion week in February 2013</li>
<li>Buy material, supplies, fabric for samples and final production.</li>
<li>Professional Photography and look books for my line (a catalog for buyers if you will)</li>
<li>Purchase necessary machines and dress forms: 1 straight stitch machine, 1 serger, 2 dress forms, a cutting table</li>
<li>Launch event</li>
<li>Hire my interns so that they can be paid employees!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Perks:</strong></h3>
<p>For everyone that contributes to this campaign I will give you something back. The perks range from a hand written note card and autographed illustration. Other rewards include a garment from the collection, special accessories, Denim Blu Tote or T-Shirt and Clutch bag. Everyone will of course receive a giant hug!!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal we will adjust the number of garments we make, for example instead of doing 20 new styles for our collection we will do 15.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><em>With each contribution you will not only help launch our new collection and get a fun sexy reward-you will also help support my mission of giving to charity organizations that support the causes we love....children with disabilities, breast/cervical cancer, disadvantaged and at risk families, heart disease and abuse</em>. <strong>10% of our profits our 2013 campaigns will go to  the TIGERLILY FOUNDATION (Breast Cancer Awareness) and UCAP (United Communities Against Poverty).

</div></div>","Welcome!
My name is Patricia Freeman, Founder and Head Designer of Denim Blu. With your help,  I'm designing a new collection for women with curvier figures. The collection is named ""BEAUTIFUL YOU"". The Inspiration is the 1920's-30's Era. (The Great Gatspy/Roaring 20's with a modern chic flair of course!
My goal is to launch this trendy and much needed collection for women, show the line in New York at Fashion Week and also donate a percentage of the donations to benefit a charity.   Our goal is $50,000+ however; we’re setting our “Indiegogo” goal at $25,000 because if we don’t reach our target, Indiegogo will take a much larger service fee.
On our 2013 Collection campaigns is to bring awareness to our charity causes in an effort to raise money for awareness and programs to educate the public. This year the causes we are supporting with our campaign will be TIGERLILY FOUNDATION & UCAP. Our home page is a video of: Maimah Karma, founder of TigerLily, discussing services TigerLily Foundation offers, breast cancer support, education and advocacy  for women ages 15-40.
During this campaign we will post video, sketches and final product to up date you on our progress. They will be located in this home page and gallery page....Enjoy! (SKETCHES will be located at the GALLERY TAB)


Why Denim Blu?
We see that for women with curvier figures, the choices are very slim as far as clothing choices. It's a market that is untapped and looking for designers such as myself willing to make trendy, beautiful and classy clothing for women of ALL shapes and sizes.
After years of my own weight fluctuation, search for clothing that fit appropriately and hearing women state their desire more clothing choices, I thought maybe alot of other women feel like I do. So, I decided to do something about it.
I then started creating clothing that would fit women of all shapes and sizes appropriately AND it's trendy at the same time. No sagging in funny places and no unusual tightness in other places that should fit.
I've found a way have the samples made but the set back is to financially pay to produce and market the collection. I have all the right interns, factory and other professionals in place and would like to bring ""BEAUTIFUL YOU"" to the world.

With your help we can:

Give 10% of our campaign fund to charity.
Produce first samples of 20 new looks for the collection
Website and marketing
Event fees and show the collection in New York during fashion week in February 2013
Buy material, supplies, fabric for samples and final production.
Professional Photography and look books for my line (a catalog for buyers if you will)
Purchase necessary machines and dress forms: 1 straight stitch machine, 1 serger, 2 dress forms, a cutting table
Launch event
Hire my interns so that they can be paid employees!

The Perks:
For everyone that contributes to this campaign I will give you something back. The perks range from a hand written note card and autographed illustration. Other rewards include a garment from the collection, special accessories, Denim Blu Tote or T-Shirt and Clutch bag. Everyone will of course receive a giant hug!!
If we do not reach our entire goal we will adjust the number of garments we make, for example instead of doing 20 new styles for our collection we will do 15.


The Impact
With each contribution you will not only help launch our new collection and get a fun sexy reward-you will also help support my mission of giving to charity organizations that support the causes we love....children with disabilities, breast/cervical cancer, disadvantaged and at risk families, heart disease and abuse. 10% of our profits our 2013 campaigns will go to  the TIGERLILY FOUNDATION (Breast Cancer Awareness) and UCAP (United Communities Against Poverty).

<h3>Who's this ""Cutman""?</h3>
<p>My name is Chris, but everyone calls me <a href=""http://www.djcutman.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cutman</a>. I DJ chiptunes and video game music, and run a record label called <a href=""http://www.gamechops.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GameChops</a>. We produce, license and distrbute high quality video game remixes! Some of you may know me from PAX, Otakon, or MAGFest.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've already got the art and the printer lined up. We need money to buy blank shirts and start the printing process. We're using IndieGoGo so anyone who has ever wanted a shirt can get one hot off the presses, in whatever size they want!</p>
<h3>All T-Shirts available in Black, White, Red, and Gray!</h3>
<p>Perks include two different shirt designs, as well as Dj CUTMAN stickers and the collectable GameChops albums featured in our <a href=""http://music.gamechops.com/merch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Merch Store</a>! Check out our perks, we've got some awesome stuff and great value!</p>
<h3>If We Exceed Our Goal</h3>
<p>We've got some awesome ideas for additional perks if we exceed our goal. If we exceed our goal, all tiers at <em>$60 and higher</em> will get stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>$600 - Oversized GameChops stickers</li>
<li>$700 - GameChops and Dj CUTMAN Buttons</li>
<li>$800 - Special edition Dj CUTMAN Stickers </li>
<li><strong>$1000 - Special edition Snapback hats</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<h3 class=""_mce_tagged_br"">The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone gets their own made-to-order T-Shirt!</p>
<p>But that's not all. If we raise additional money, we will use it to hire artists to create album art for our releases that are not currently available as a CD. This will both help GameChops grow as a label, and produce a sweet new product that never existed before! The <strong>Album Producer</strong> perk gives a special supporter the ability to choose what album gets printed next!</p>
<p>GameChops is the first record label to focus on licensed, high-quality video game dance music. Supporting us by contributing to this IndieGoGo and wearing our shirts is worth so much. Every little bit helps!</p>

<p></p></div>","At The Gonq press, we will use the innovation of on-demand printers, with their convenience, immediacy, and customizability, and enhance it with the beauty and tradition of letterpress.We propose to lease an on-demand book printer—an all-in-one printing, cutting, and binding unit that produces a perfect, store-quality bound paperback book in a matter of minutes—in order to release curated series of public domain works with beautifully designed letterpress covers from Toronto's own Any Key Press. The machine will also be run as a small press for the public, as well as being used to help organizations that we believe in, such as Story Planet and the Toronto Public Library Foundation.A book's cover doesn't change the quality of the contents, but all of us here at the Gonq feel that, with the sheer number of books in teetering stacks around our respective homes, they also end up making up a huge chunk of your everyday visual landscape.  Why not like looking at them too?(*update: here's a handy-dandy infographic to better understand the Gonq Press!)In Canada, a “work” (in our case, a book) becomes freely available for anyone to use once the creator has been dead for at least 50 years. This means that the works of any writer who died before 1964 are fair game and anyone can create new editions of them or produce copies. Everyone from William Shakespeare to Ernest Hemingway is in the public domain!Rebecca Andoff has been in retail management for nearly a decade, including two years spent in bookstores.  She has spent the last three years developing and refining a detailed business plan for The Algonquin Bookshop and The Gonq Press.  In 2012, Beck started a daily book blog (now on hiatus) dedicated to demystifying and appreciating the literary world—exactly the values that The Algonquin will be built upon.  She is currently the Social Enterprise Manager at Story Planet, a children's literacy charity in Toronto's Bloordale neighbourhood.  Story Planet is a non-profit storymaking centre that offers free workshops for kids and teens, ranging from after school homework help to teen filmmaking.The rest of the Gonq team is made up of a crew of four with extensive experience in graphic design, illustration, social media marketing, small business bookkeeping, and a combined 17+ years in book retail.The Gonq is one piece of the Algonquin Bookshop.  The Algonquin is a new store we aim to open in Toronto later this year featuring a fully licensed cafe and event space. In the last little while a lot of attention has turned to a slew of bookstores closing across town, much to the dismay of readers, but we offer a modern, evolving business model: a store with customer service, ambience, convenience, and community involvement that will set a whole new standard in book retail. The Algonquin will be a cozy, friendly, well-curated shop staffed by experts of all stripes, with damn good coffee, beer, and wine, which also provides options for online shopping and easy home delivery. But the key to its ongoing success will be The Gonq, our on-demand printer. This printer allows us the freedom to not have to pre-pay for and store hundreds of classic titles, but rather produce them as needed—no wasted storage space, no shipping fees, and a significantly reduced initial investment, all of which allows us to bring in a wider range of contemporary titles and interesting gift options.We are asking for $20,000. This is enough to lease and run the machine for over six months, expand the series we produce (including working with more amazing illustrators and designers), and get your books to you.  Any money we raise, and especially the number of people who help fund our campaign, will be a show of support that helps us also get more traditional funding to open the shop.Why isn't this a crowdfunding campaign to open the bookstore?  Because we have such faith in the viability of our business plan, that there's no need to rely on donations.  The Gonq is a creative project, and we very much wanted it to be more like pre-purchasing product you genuinely love, rather than open-ended donation (as much as we appreciate that, too!)If you're interested in making a repayable loan to the bookstore of an amount over $1000, firstly: thanks, pal! Secondly, please contact Beck at Rebecca.Andoff@gmail.com and we can arrange a meeting to go over the business plan in greater detail.We’ll be starting with two series of carefully chosen titles featuring exclusively designed letterpress covers printed by Toronto's Any Key Press:The Blurred Line Between Fiction And Memoir(Note: The are mock-ups. The final product will be paperback; details may vary.)""Write what you know"" is the first rule of fiction, but with these masters it is hard to tell what is really true and what is embellishment. The main question on our minds is, does that really matter?

My Lady Nicotine by J.M. Barrie


A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway


The Egg And I by Betty MacDonald


Down And Out In Paris And London by George Orwell


Walden; or, Life In The Woods by Henry David Thoreau

The Lesser Works(Note: These are mock-ups. The final product will be paperback; details may vary. Grey areas denote embossing.)Each of these authors is known primarily for one or two major works, but this collection shows that even their oft-overlooked books contain strokes of genius.

Who We Are
In the Spring of 2012, and at only 26 years old, entrepreneur Dara Frydman launched Designher Co. out of a passion for all things handmade, beautiful and practical. The stylish studio in Toronto, Canada, offers an antidote to macaroni necklaces with chic DIY classes, camps and parties.
Dara Frydman also owns dara dot designs, a handmade fashion scarf business, which earned her a coveted spot at The One of a Kind Show in Toronto.
She recently became the host of Coral TVs specialty craft show, DIY with Designher Co.
Searching for a way to spread the DIY love, Designher Kit was launched in 2013 to deliver gleaming metallic envelopes filled with inspiration, project supplies, and treasures to the masses.
All this couldn't be possible without the creativity and support of the rest of our team (listed at the bottom of the screen)- thank you!!
What We Need
$3800 | Raw Materials { kit contents, packaging, print material }
$3000 | Website Expansion { design, coding, photography, videography }
$400   | Business and office expenses { fees, 800 phone line, office supplies }
$800   | Staff { administrative assistance, production }
$1000 | Marketing { press kits, AdWords, social media, contests, etc. }
= $9,000
Campaign funds raised in excess of the initial $9,000 will be used towards marketing initiatives, staff increase, warehouse space, and of course top-notch jewelry supplies to help make the kits (even more) Ah-mazing :)
* The first $500 raised in excess of our goal, will go towards teaching Dara to be less awkward on camera. Just kidding. Sort of.

What will you get if you pledge?
Pledge the Designher Kit campaign, and you have access to choose the perk(s) that are best for you! Be the first to receive this amazing kit, as subsequent subscribers may be subject to a waiting list.
In addition to these perks, we will be sending along a blank holiday card, so that you can easily gift your perk to a friend... Or even write yourself a lovely note. Heck, you deserve it :)
DIY Starter Kits will ship by December 1st, 2013 (unless otherwise noted in perk detail).
Once the campaign ends, we will contact you for your preference of gold-toned or silver-toned jewels (or a mix), and any other information we might need to complete your order. Our goal is to ship premier Designher Kits by January 20th 2014.

<p> </p>
<p>Mi nombre es Ricardo Álvarez, soy un fotógrafo con más de 20 años de trabajo principalmente en el área de la creación artística y ocasionalmente como fotógrafo deportivo.</p>
<p>Combino mi pasión por la imagen con el gusto por dar clases, soy, desde hace más de 15 años profesor de lengua y también de fotografía.</p>

<p>A pesar de preferir el formato digital creo firmemente que todo lo que Ansel Adams dice y el cuidado que recomienda en el proceso de la impresión siguen y seguirán siendo válidos y por tanto me gusta seguir sus consejos (obras como The Print sigue siendo un clásico para los fotógrafos) por lo que tener control completo del proceso es importante para conseguir los mejores resultados.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Nicole Katherine is the owner and designer for Nicole Katherine Designs. For over seven years she's been creating apparel <span>inspired by her love for 1940's and 1950's Hollywood
Glamour. Originally her ideas were a melting pot of inspiration from golden era screen sirens, pin up girls,
rockabilly, and that old country western look (think Dale Evans), mixed with her edgy punk rock past. Throughout the past few years her line has evolved from a costumy country western look, to a
sophisticated and flirty line, with vintage silhouettes and the same
sass you find in my personality.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting Nicole Katherine Designs, you'll be doing your part to support job growth in the US and shun the concept of Made In China. You're also saving the world from the faux pas dominated fashion market by supporting an original idea in apparel. Nicole Katherine is anti-fast fashion and celebrates the woman's body by creating apparel suitable for all body types, not hiding the female form under frumpy tshirt knit duds, baby doll blouses and baggy boho style.<br/></p>
<p><br/>Support Nicole Katherine Designs and you'll contribute to the revival of the American dream, and renew hope in prosperity. Nicole Katherine strives to be an inspiration to everyone through her hard work and dedication to her goals. She's a single mom and believes that women can balance both family (plus old fashioned values) and career and still move ahead.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By helping us reach our goal, we'll be able to complete the entire line for Fall/Winter 2011- Spring/Summer 2012. We'll be able to have inventory and eliminate both our wholesale and retail customers' waiting period. This will help us boost customer satisfaction, and increase sales since items will be in stock and available for immediate purchase. In addition, we'll be able to bring down the cost of our garments by about 15-20% since we'll be able to produce more items at once.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our estimated goal also includes advertisement and marketing expenses. We'd like to update the website and make it more fun, interactive and user friendly. Plus, we want to spread the word by creating a catalog to distribute to boutiques throughout Europe, Australia and the Americas. Furthermore, we would like to be featured in a showroom in LA for a certain period of time, as well as in New York. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need $15,000 to complete the full line for Fall/Winter 2011- Spring/Summer 2012. Even if we meet half of our goal this will give us the boost we need to streamline our production and have items created in a timely manner.<br/><br/>By helping Nicole Katherine Designs you'll receive the following:<br/><br/>Donations of $5-$24= Our sincerest of thanks and a credit on our social networking site.<br/><br/>Donations of $25-$75= You'll receive our sincerest of thanks, a credit on our website and social networking site as one of our donors/sponsors and a hair accessory or other item from one of our sponsors.<br/><br/>Donations of $76 and up= A Nicole Katherine Designs tshirt or boy beater (your choice), a credit on our site and social networking site as one of our donors/sponsors, plus we'll add your company's banner and business information (if available) to help you as you've helped us!<br/><br/>In Addition....<br/>Nicole Katherine Designs would like to throw a party during fashion week in September. The location will either be in Missoula, MT or Los Angeles, CA. Depending on where the majority of our sponsors are located. If we have equal sponsors in the Northwest and SoCal region we'll make arrangements to accomodate everyone :) this is TBA.<br/>The party is available for anyone to attend that donated $50 and up. Anyone who donated less than $50 is welcome to attend but will be charged a small cover fee.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Funds are tight? We completely understand! You can also help out by spreading the word to your friends. Or, donate your time when available. You can help us by promoting our line, or donate your talents to assist us with sales, advertising, design room help, ideas, etc. <br/></p>

By supporting Nicole Katherine Designs, you'll be doing your part to support job growth in the US and shun the concept of Made In China. You're also saving the world from the faux pas dominated fashion market by supporting an original idea in apparel. Nicole Katherine is anti-fast fashion and celebrates the woman's body by creating apparel suitable for all body types, not hiding the female form under frumpy tshirt knit duds, baby doll blouses and baggy boho style.
Support Nicole Katherine Designs and you'll contribute to the revival of the American dream, and renew hope in prosperity. Nicole Katherine strives to be an inspiration to everyone through her hard work and dedication to her goals. She's a single mom and believes that women can balance both family (plus old fashioned values) and career and still move ahead.

By helping us reach our goal, we'll be able to complete the entire line for Fall/Winter 2011- Spring/Summer 2012. We'll be able to have inventory and eliminate both our wholesale and retail customers' waiting period. This will help us boost customer satisfaction, and increase sales since items will be in stock and available for immediate purchase. In addition, we'll be able to bring down the cost of our garments by about 15-20% since we'll be able to produce more items at once.

Our estimated goal also includes advertisement and marketing expenses. We'd like to update the website and make it more fun, interactive and user friendly. Plus, we want to spread the word by creating a catalog to distribute to boutiques throughout Europe, Australia and the Americas. Furthermore, we would like to be featured in a showroom in LA for a certain period of time, as well as in New York. 



What We Need & What You GetWe need $15,000 to complete the full line for Fall/Winter 2011- Spring/Summer 2012. Even if we meet half of our goal this will give us the boost we need to streamline our production and have items created in a timely manner.By helping Nicole Katherine Designs you'll receive the following:Donations of $5-$24= Our sincerest of thanks and a credit on our social networking site.Donations of $25-$75= You'll receive our sincerest of thanks, a credit on our website and social networking site as one of our donors/sponsors and a hair accessory or other item from one of our sponsors.Donations of $76 and up= A Nicole Katherine Designs tshirt or boy beater (your choice), a credit on our site and social networking site as one of our donors/sponsors, plus we'll add your company's banner and business information (if available) to help you as you've helped us!In Addition....Nicole Katherine Designs would like to throw a party during fashion week in September. The location will either be in Missoula, MT or Los Angeles, CA. Depending on where the majority of our sponsors are located. If we have equal sponsors in the Northwest and SoCal region we'll make arrangements to accomodate everyone :) this is TBA.The party is available for anyone to attend that donated $50 and up. Anyone who donated less than $50 is welcome to attend but will be charged a small cover fee.

<p><strong>Cycle Co</strong>. is more than a company; it is an idea, and a way of viewing and understanding our ever complex and mysterious world. The word ‘Cycle’ is derived from several ideologies.<br/><br/> First, we believe in a closed loop <strong>cycle</strong> of production where no waste is created through the manufacturing of our products.  <br/><br/>Second, we will reconstitute waste, trash, and debris and convert them into products. <br/><br/>Lastly, we believe that every human being is connected and we are all involved in this <strong>cycle</strong> of human development. Just as we respond to the <strong>cycle</strong> of seasons that alter our way of life, we believe we have to respond to the <strong>cycle</strong> of time. It is time we implement a sustainable <strong>cycle</strong> in the production and consumption of our products, and we hope to set a primary example of how this can be done through intuitive design.</p>

<h3>MOKU - Urushi Wooden Framed Sunglasses</h3>
<p>With 2 and a half years of research and testing, we have finally produced a pair of wooden framed sunglasses with a new aesthetic, shape, and materiality. The Sunglasses come in 2 varnishes. Black Urushi 黒漆 (Left) and Natural Urushi 生漆 (Right).</p>
<p>二年半の研究を積み重ねて完成した漆の木造サングラス。社会にまだ出回っていない素材感と形態。後、自然にやさしく、制作に廃棄物をださない生産さいくるを活用しました。黒漆と生漆：二種類の漆でサングラスを制作いたしました。</p>

<h3>Urushi ＜漆＞</h3>
<span class=""image-caption current"" style="""">Urushi, also known as Japanese Lacquer, is a natural material obtained from the urushi tree. When the trunk of tree is cut, it produces a resin to try to repair the wound. This resin is Urushi. A single tree can only produce a few grams of resin each time it is taped. Because it is so hard to obtain, urushi is considered a very valuable material.</span>

<h3>The Rolly Polly Case<em><br/></em>
</h3>
<p><span class=""image-caption current"" style="""">The case is designed by combining two existing entities. First, a Kakejiku ＜掛け軸＞, a hanging scroll, and second, a rolly polly. When a rolly polly senses danger, it crawls up into a ball protecting itself from the outer world through its hard shell. The case uses the same idea - the case raps around the glasses, protecting the frames from damage.</span></p>

Cycle Co. is more than a company; it is an idea, and a way of viewing and understanding our ever complex and mysterious world. The word ‘Cycle’ is derived from several ideologies. First, we believe in a closed loop cycle of production where no waste is created through the manufacturing of our products.  Second, we will reconstitute waste, trash, and debris and convert them into products. Lastly, we believe that every human being is connected and we are all involved in this cycle of human development. Just as we respond to the cycle of seasons that alter our way of life, we believe we have to respond to the cycle of time. It is time we implement a sustainable cycle in the production and consumption of our products, and we hope to set a primary example of how this can be done through intuitive design.
Today we ask you to help mobilize cycle by investing in our newest invention.

MOKU - Urushi Wooden Framed Sunglasses
With 2 and a half years of research and testing, we have finally produced a pair of wooden framed sunglasses with a new aesthetic, shape, and materiality. The Sunglasses come in 2 varnishes. Black Urushi 黒漆 (Left) and Natural Urushi 生漆 (Right).
二年半の研究を積み重ねて完成した漆の木造サングラス。社会にまだ出回っていない素材感と形態。後、自然にやさしく、制作に廃棄物をださない生産さいくるを活用しました。黒漆と生漆：二種類の漆でサングラスを制作いたしました。

The product is a dialogue between the past and the present - tradtion and innovation.伝統と発明：私たちは古いものと新しいものと両立した世界で生きています。
Urushi ＜漆＞
Urushi, also known as Japanese Lacquer, is a natural material obtained from the urushi tree. When the trunk of tree is cut, it produces a resin to try to repair the wound. This resin is Urushi. A single tree can only produce a few grams of resin each time it is taped. Because it is so hard to obtain, urushi is considered a very valuable material.


漆はウルシの木からとれる天然素材です。幹に傷をつけるとその傷を塞ごうとでてくる樹液が漆です。一本の木から一回に取れる樹液はわずか数グラム。採集にとても難しい漆はとても貴重なものです。

The Sunglasses come in two types of urushi: 生漆 (natural urushi) and 黒漆 (urushi with black pigment).
AIZOME ＜藍染＞
Each sunglasses comes with a small bag made out of an AIZOME ＜藍染め＞ fabric with a WAGARA pattern ＜和柄＞ (Japanese Pattern).
サングラスを守ってあげるための袋は藍染めの生地を使っており、一つ一つ手作りでこだわったつくりになっております。

AIZOME is the Japanese word for Indigo dye. 
The Rolly Polly Case

The case is designed by combining two existing entities. First, a Kakejiku ＜掛け軸＞, a hanging scroll, and second, a rolly polly. When a rolly polly senses danger, it crawls up into a ball protecting itself from the outer world through its hard shell. The case uses the same idea - the case raps around the glasses, protecting the frames from damage.
日本独特の掛け軸の形態と身体を守るために自分を包み込むダンゴムシ：その二つの媒体が融合することによってできたケース。ケースもサングラス本体と同様、漆で仕上げており、竹と綿製のたこ紐を使用したデザインです。

Biomimicry - We look towards nature when we design.
A Personal Touch
We will engrave a name, word, symbol, or logo on to the ear piece of the frames for the first 200 pairs we create through this fund-raising campaign. We can take any image or font and engrave it into the earpiece of your frames.
一番最初にご購入された２００名のお客さんには、お客さん好みの文字、名前、記号またはシンボルを耳当てに彫り込むサービスをさせていただきます。

Maybe for a present, maybe for yourself, or maybe for that special someone.友達に、自分に、または特別なあのひとに．．．
Lens Option
Our investors have three choices in selecting the color of lens they want. LIGHT - MIDIUM - DARK. Lens are UV cut.
レンズも３種類から選んでいただきます。ライト、ミディアム、ダーク。UVカットのレンズを使用しております。

Materiality

Keep it natural
The lens's are made out of recyclable plastic, and the frames are made 100 percent out of wood. The wood we used is called Tilia Japonica, a light wood that grows locally all over Japan.
レンズはリサイクル可能。メガネは１００％木製。木は日本列島に生存するシナノキの合板。地球に優しい「もの」と生産工法：それが一番！

We really care about our planet.

Inspired by the amazing rocker frogs and the simplicity and convenience of a drawstring bag I am happy to present the first Kerorek bag design! A kick-ass drawstring backpack with focus on high quality, usability and attitude!Kerorek was initially an independent project of mine but I have received a lot of support, encouragement and help from my friends and colleagues. Without them and my team I would have never been able to take it this far.And now I'm asking you guys to help us to take the next big step!Thank you!Designer, Milla Niskakoski   Design and MaterialsKerorek takes the classic construction of a drawstring bag to the next level. The effortless closing and opening method, minimalistic design with shoulder paddings and durable and high-quality materials make the KEROREK bag an awesome and convenient everyday bag. The size of the bag is designed to look great whether you are packing it full for a weekend trip or carrying just a few things.Besides the big main compartment, the bag has a small quick-access front pocket and a full size padded slim pocket inside. The inside pocket fits laptops or tablets up to 15 inches.Kerorek bags will be available in two lines: Exclusive leather line and light canvas line. The leather bag will be available in brown genuine goat leather, and the canvas bags will be available in PU-coated white and black canvas.The minimalistic design means you don't get anything unnecessary, but instead a quality bag that is convenient and comfortable while still being surprisingly attractive. Leather White canvas Black canvas  Features

Shoulder pads. Easily adjustable shoulder pads for great comfort. 
​3 compartments. In addition to the big main compartment, the Kerorek bags are equipped with a fast-access front pocket and a padded slim pocket inside the bag.

Adjustable straps. The length of the shoulder straps can be easily adjusted to your size and taste.

Keyring. You can hang items such as water bottles or accessories to the metallic keyring outside the bag.

Zippers. We use only Japanese high quality YKK products so the zippers will last just as long as the materials.
   Stretch goals200 orders - With this many orders, we can exceed the minimum order quantity and have the cotton liner printed with our Kerorek frog pattern.  For less than 200 bags we will use the forest themed stock fabric, which is still pretty cool.400 orders - We will custom make awesome metal zipper pullers with our own design! SizeThe Kerorek bags are sized significantly larger than normal drawstring bags, which makes them great as backpacks. The straps are easily adjustable to fit your size and taste!  Custom liner print design (stretch goal)   The frogsKerorek's totem animal is the Asian Horned frog. These frogs blew my mind with their awesomeness when I saw them while traveling in Malaysia. The unspoken rock'n'roll attitude of the frogs took me back to my teenage years as a colorful metalhead. It reminded me that, as grownups, no matter where and what we end up doing in life, we should not forget the rebellious and free spirit that was once everything to us. It is in that spirit I create the first and all the future designs of Kerorek! Croak'n'Roll! Asian Horned Frogs Kerorek leather patch (Canvas bags will have a rubber patch) The perks! OBS: If you cannot find the right perk for you, feel free to message us! We can bundle together a selection of bags and ship in the same package, saving both trouble and money! The leather bagThe Kerorek leather bag is made of quality goat leather, and each bag will have its own individual texture and character as all leather does. Save $100 from the expected resale price ($249) and get it for our Indiegogo-only discounted pre-sale price $149!    The canvas bagsThe Kerorek canvas bag is made of strong and light drizzle-proof coated canvas from Korea, and instead has a rubber patch to make a proper vegan option. Save $20 off the expected resale price ($69) and get it for our Indiegogo-only discounted pre-sale price $49!   White  Black  NOTICE!

The leopard is a special animal, very independent but with great leadership skills and confidence while always staying in good shape, a certain elegance emanate from it which force respect and impose natural leadership. The Leopard collection was created to inspire those traits, to help you to inspire others while being a great, reliable leader. </p><h3>The Wolf</h3><p>Power, freedom, loyalty, shrewdness, intuition, awareness, and energy.

We created a Wolf collection, to express this combativeness and help men to remember their goals. </p><h3>The Monkey King</h3><p>Intelligence, authority, clarity, honor, intensity, protection and family. The choice of creating a Monkey King collection was directly inspired by the project creator experience in Taiwan and China. The Monkey King legend can be tracked as far as the Song Dynasty (宋朝;Sòng cháo; 960–1279). As the legend feature, he was originally a monkey born from a stone who acquired immense powers and strength through Taoist practices. Very clever, sometimes very playful and tricky, sometimes very wise and honorable, he is an iconic characters of Chinese culture.

Those Red Chinese stones are present in a lot of temples to bring protection, peace and harmony. </p><h3>Oghams</h3><p>Special collection, those bracelets are designed to match with others. It doesn’t mean that they don’t have their own story. Ogham is actually the name of an early medieval alphabet used to write the early Irish language which is the oldest known form of the Goidelic languages. Our brand, Augmios was largely inspired by Ogmios, Celtic god of eloquence known under the name Ogma in Irish mythology. In the legend, the ogham alphabet, which has a runic look, was created by Ogma itself for the profit of the learned. The central piece of our Ogham collection remind of this runic look of the old Ogham alphabet while matching with your other animal bracelets and bringing a bit of mythology and our brand spirit at once. </p><h3>The Stones</h3><p>In popular beliefs, stones have meanings and abilities.

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>NightCap is the first pragmatic solution to the drink-spiking epidemic. NightCap turns your hair scrunchie into a drink cover to create a simple and convenient solution. Just wear your NightCap in your hair or on your wrist. When you want to use it, simply remove it, pull the cover out of the pocket and place it over your drink. There is a built in straw hole so you can drink with peace of mind.</li>
<li>NightCap was invented by 16-year-old Shirah Benarde from West Palm Beach, Florida. The company is run by her and her brother, Michael, a senior at Florida State University.</li>
<li>Drink spiking has become an epidemic around the world and with your contributions we can finally introduce a product that will help put an end to it. </li>
<li>Your contributions will help significantly reduce alcohol- and drug-induced sexual assault and robberies.</li>
<li>NightCap makes a defiant statement showing that you are aware of the threat and acts as a deterrent to potential predators.</li>
<li>There are endless design possibilities with NightCap. Not only is it going to save lives, but it provides a new way for women to express themselves through their drink. Trendy designs, funny quotes, and school logos are all in the works. We're also looking to wholesale NightCap to companies with their branding on them. This will be an exceptional marketing opportunity for bars, clubs, music festivals, and liquor brands.</li>

</ul></div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Short Summary

NightCap is the first pragmatic solution to the drink-spiking epidemic. NightCap turns your hair scrunchie into a drink cover to create a simple and convenient solution. Just wear your NightCap in your hair or on your wrist. When you want to use it, simply remove it, pull the cover out of the pocket and place it over your drink. There is a built in straw hole so you can drink with peace of mind.
NightCap was invented by 16-year-old Shirah Benarde from West Palm Beach, Florida. The company is run by her and her brother, Michael, a senior at Florida State University.
Drink spiking has become an epidemic around the world and with your contributions we can finally introduce a product that will help put an end to it. 
Your contributions will help significantly reduce alcohol- and drug-induced sexual assault and robberies.
NightCap makes a defiant statement showing that you are aware of the threat and acts as a deterrent to potential predators.
There are endless design possibilities with NightCap. Not only is it going to save lives, but it provides a new way for women to express themselves through their drink. Trendy designs, funny quotes, and school logos are all in the works. We're also looking to wholesale NightCap to companies with their branding on them. This will be an exceptional marketing opportunity for bars, clubs, music festivals, and liquor brands.
We want to get NightCap in the hands of as many women as possible. This is why we're looking into licensing it to popular women's clothing and lifestyle brands that can add their own designs and help bring NightCap mainstream.

It will provide you a better sleep and a healthier life. Now we’re back on Indiegogo, with a new version of Barner that we are convinced you will fall in love with! 
 
 Your new Barners won’t just help you sleep better and improve your health; now they come with an evolved Blue light blocking lens for better protection, and a great & colorful design to keep your cool style wherever you go! Barner Eyewear is the perfect combination between health and style. Screens are part of our daily life now and this is why we think computer glasses should be a no brainer tool to use on a daily basis. That's the reason why we put lot of effort into creating stylish and comfortable eyewear which at the same time has the best protection for your eyes. We live totally surrounded by screens, spending almost 9 hours a day, on average, in front of digital devices. All these digital devices are emitting blue light that may be detrimental and our eyes are not prepared for the overexposure that we are suffering these days.  Because of that overexposure in front of screens, a new Digital Sickness called Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS)  is emerging.  

Typical image you will see in an office after long hours in front of screensCVS affects 90% of people spending more than 3 hours per day in front of screens and some of the symptoms are:  
Eyestrain, dry eyes, red eyes, eye fatigue 
Headaches, neck pain 
Double vision, vertigo/dizziness, difficulty refocusing the eyes
Reduction of melatonin production 
Change of sleeping cycles (circadian rhythms) 
 This is why we’ve created Barner, the ultimate computer glasses. 
 
 
 
 Barner's lenses, have a coating specially developed for people who spend a lot of their time indoors and are exposed to blue-violet light from LEDs as well as smartphone, TV, tablet or computer screens. As technology evolves, so does our special Blue Light Blocking Lenses.  
 This new collection’s lenses block 40% of the Blue Light on the 430nm - 450nm spectrum and 100% of the Blue Light at 410nm. You will be protected in any kind situation. 
 
 We bring you 3 different models inspired by the coolest neighbourhoods of Paris, London and Madrid. You have 6 different colours to choose from each model making a total of 18 different designs available on Indiegogo. 
 
 
In order to choose the perfect model, we would advise you take some glasses that suit you perfectly, measure them and get the closest in terms of sizing in our available range

  Having the ""Chamberí"" frame design on Indiegogo has been a last minute decision and mainly brought forward because it has been super popular among all backers. Because of this, for now, the only thing we have to share with you of the Chamberí design is a 3D printed prototype and a photshop edition with all the pantone colours we are going to manufacture (see on the .gifs above).Unfortunately we won't be able to receive the samples before finishing the campaign, so we won't be able to provide pictures with models wearing them. Apologies about that.In order to choose the perfect model, we would advise you take some glasses that suit you perfectly, measure them and get the closest in terms of sizing in our available range
 
 
 
 
 
 
Once you finish working with your laptop, you just need to attach the clip-on to your Barners and transform them into the coolest sunglasses. With this accessory you will now be able to use your Barners in front of the screens but also on the street, relaxing at your favorite beach or breathing some fresh air in the mountains. 
 
 
Be sure to pledge on any of the rewards with the solar clip-on and you will get this amazing accessory for €20 or less. We think every product start with its own packaging, this is why we have developed a package with amazing quality, great design and filled with great surprises. 
 

1st stretch goal, Blue Palace color, unlocked!! 

2nd stretch goal, ""Chamberí"" design frame, unlocked!
 
3rd Stretch Goal, Honey color available for all frame designs unlocked! Last year we did our first kickstarter campaign and we successfully delivered all the goods to every single backer. In total we sent 965 orders to 62 different countries.

Edu has been working in the digital space for many years. He built his first start-up 7 years ago and has also been working in companies like Samsung and Google for the previous 4 years before starting this amazing entrepreneurship adventure.

<p>828 represents August 28th, a significant date in Black History/American History. The events that occurred on this date emphasize some of the challenges and triumphs in the fight for equality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is still a persistent unfair division in this country that goes back generations. With The 828 Movement, we choose to 1) recognize and remember the past efforts, 2) respect the present pursuits for equality and 3) create hope for a brighter future.</p>
<p>By backing our campaign you are allowing us to call attention to continued challenges and struggles in certain areas across our nation (i.e., urban areas that are statistically disregarded and diluted), but also offer a solution to implement change.</p>

<h3>Have you ever wanted to become your own designer?!</h3>
<h3>And, have the power to personalize your clothing just the way you want it?</h3>
<h3><strong>Well, now you can!<br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Rose Athena offers the solution for women to<strong> help them shop for dresses exactly the way they want them.

<p>Rose Athena was born out of the frustration we faced when we went dress shopping. We spent countless hours searching for dresses that would fit our personal styles. In the end, we settled for dresses that were not to our liking. When we spoke with our friends, we realized that we were not alone in facing this dilemma.</p>
<p>Women have difficulty shopping for dresses because we cannot easily find what we are looking for in terms of design. We may find some likeable components, such as the neckline or color of a dress, but may not like the entire dress.</p>
<p>On Rose Athena, you have the opportunity to design your dress just the way you want it.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Over 2500 different dress designs can be created!</em></strong></h3>
<p>You have the opportunity to select from 7 different styling options such as neckline, sleeve length, waistline, backline, hemline, fabric and color, as shown below:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.3ders.org/articles/20130518-ic3d-printers-launches-crowd-funding-campaign-to-make-better-3d-printing-material.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3Ders.org</a></p>

<h3>Who are we and what are we doing?</h3>
<p>We are Michael Cao and Larry Knopp.  Michael Cao has been in the automotive industry for about 10 years as a product design engineer specializing in interiors. Throughout that time, he's also used various commercial 3D printers to prove out concepts for plastic parts. For the past 2 years, he's dabbled with desktop 3D printers and has built and tuned about three dozen Repraps, Makerbots, and others.  </p>
<p>Larry Knopp also has a mechanical engineering backgroud, is an IT systems expert and enjoys teaching.  He has spent nearly everyday experimenting with desktop 3D printing for about 2 years.  Larry loves to spend his free time contributing to 3D printer forums and groups and has helped hundreds of people start printing on their own.</p>
<p>Together, we've gone through A LOT of filament from various producers and are frankly tired of poor quality in the form of loose diameter tolerances, DEBRIS in filament, low quality raw plastic base and paying overseas shipping in some cases. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic3dprinters.com/images/IGG/MVI_0073.MOV.Still001%201.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What exactly are the problems?</h3>
<p><strong>Diameter</strong>: Most desktop 3D printers, such as Repraps, Makerbots, (and even the 3Doodlers) drive plastic rod that's usually 3mm or 1.75mm in diameter through a tiny hole (and, in some cases, a tube, such as in Bowden systems) to then get melted.  While typical ""extruders"" can handle slight variances, most systems will jam and cause filament stripping if the size is too large or too small.</p>
<p><strong>Debris</strong>:  Nearly all producers of 3D printing filament primarily produce the product for the plastic welding industry. Plastic welders take 3mm filament and push it out of a 3mm nozzle.  Any debris in the filament doesn't get detected, therefore the manufacturers only need a certain low level of quality control. The nozzle on most 3D printers is only about 0.25mm-0.5mm in diameter!  Any tiny piece of sawdust or cardboard shaving will cause clogging (which will pretty much ruin your weekend).</p>
<p><strong>Plastic source:</strong>  Not all ABS is created equal. ABS is an engineered plastic.  Therefore, thousands of different formulations have been created to cater to various product needs. Some are designed to be very hard for things like safety hard hats, while others are designed to be more flexible and support fine detail like for automotive interiors.  ABS that works great for one industry doesn't necessarily extrude well in 3D printers.</p>
<p><strong>Moisture:</strong> ABS and PLA, which are the two most common materials for 3D printing, are slightly hygroscopic meaning they absorb moisture.  When the material that's about to be extruded in a 3D printer contains moisture, it will essentially boil in the hot-end then create a little bubble that pops out of the nozzle.  This is not only bad for surface appearance, but will cause poor layer bonding which can be disastrous for structural parts.</p>
<p><img alt=""pic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic3dprinters.com/images/IGG/00052.MTS.Still001.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How exactly will we address the problems?</h3>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for $20,000 to help cover some of the cost for equipment, raw materials in bulk, factory space and hiring skilled local operators. In return, not only do you get high quality, lower cost, home-grown filament, you'll be helping us bring this filament to the entire 3D printing community!</p>
<p>Your contributions will go towards an industrial size plastic extrusion production line (big!), several tons of virgin ABS pellets (heavy!), supplies such as spools, labels and bags, factory space, and most importantly, a skilled operator (brave!).</p>

<h3>What will we be making and why?</h3>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> At this time, we're going to only produce ABS filament.  We personally enjoy printing with ABS for its extruding characteristics (less oozing), mechanical properties (less brittle and squeaky), chemical properties (acetone-fusing smaller parts to make big ones), and post-processing ease (acetone vapor washes are just fantastic).  Our central Ohio 3D printing community also seems to favor ABS.  We understand that PLA is also a very popular material along with the growing use of Nylon.  So, we will not rule out producing this material in the future, perhaps with a second extruder to guarantee material purity.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> We mainly use 3mm diameter filament for its ease of handling and toughness against stripping vs. 1.75mm.  From our experience in the 3D printing world, it seems that the split between 3mm and 1.75mm filament users is pretty close to 50%.  Therefore, we plan to start extruding 3mm filament first, followed shortly by 1.75mm size.</p>
<p><strong>Color:</strong> We will be offering our standard palette of colors.  This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural</li>
<li>Black</li>
<li>Red</li>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Orange</li>
<li>Green</li>

<h3>Perks:</h3>
<p>We've designed the perks to cater to these categories of printers:</p>
<p><strong>The casual printer:  </strong>makes their own prototypes, toys, and other gadgets to impress their co-workers and also to keep their spouse from getting upset at all the time they spend 3D printing.</p>
<p><strong>The frequent printer:</strong> gets requests to print things from everyone they know, from the dentist to the moms of their buddies.  His peers are usually jealous that he owns a 3D printer.</p>
<p><strong>The start-up:  </strong>This guy got a printer and started making some cash selling Reprap kits.  Knows the difficulty in finding a good low-cost filament supplier, but wants to buy wholesale for his own printing and to re-sell on his site.  Dreams of quitting corporate America.</p>
<p><strong>The hackerspace:</strong>  a group of local guys who hang out regularly to make stuff and geek-out together.  They enjoy helping each other form theories about the existance of ""Z-banding.""  Loves group buys.</p>
<p><strong>The printing libraries:  </strong>Now, this is a cool concept that's starting to pop up all over the country.  Libraries (the ones full of 2D printed objects...) are starting to obtain 3D printers and train up librarians to print things for people.  Just awesome.</p>

Who are we and what are we doing?
We are Michael Cao and Larry Knopp.  Michael Cao has been in the automotive industry for about 10 years as a product design engineer specializing in interiors. Throughout that time, he's also used various commercial 3D printers to prove out concepts for plastic parts. For the past 2 years, he's dabbled with desktop 3D printers and has built and tuned about three dozen Repraps, Makerbots, and others.  
Larry Knopp also has a mechanical engineering backgroud, is an IT systems expert and enjoys teaching.  He has spent nearly everyday experimenting with desktop 3D printing for about 2 years.  Larry loves to spend his free time contributing to 3D printer forums and groups and has helped hundreds of people start printing on their own.
Together, we've gone through A LOT of filament from various producers and are frankly tired of poor quality in the form of loose diameter tolerances, DEBRIS in filament, low quality raw plastic base and paying overseas shipping in some cases. 

What exactly are the problems?
Diameter: Most desktop 3D printers, such as Repraps, Makerbots, (and even the 3Doodlers) drive plastic rod that's usually 3mm or 1.75mm in diameter through a tiny hole (and, in some cases, a tube, such as in Bowden systems) to then get melted.  While typical ""extruders"" can handle slight variances, most systems will jam and cause filament stripping if the size is too large or too small.
Debris:  Nearly all producers of 3D printing filament primarily produce the product for the plastic welding industry. Plastic welders take 3mm filament and push it out of a 3mm nozzle.  Any debris in the filament doesn't get detected, therefore the manufacturers only need a certain low level of quality control. The nozzle on most 3D printers is only about 0.25mm-0.5mm in diameter!  Any tiny piece of sawdust or cardboard shaving will cause clogging (which will pretty much ruin your weekend).
Plastic source:  Not all ABS is created equal. ABS is an engineered plastic.  Therefore, thousands of different formulations have been created to cater to various product needs. Some are designed to be very hard for things like safety hard hats, while others are designed to be more flexible and support fine detail like for automotive interiors.  ABS that works great for one industry doesn't necessarily extrude well in 3D printers.
Moisture: ABS and PLA, which are the two most common materials for 3D printing, are slightly hygroscopic meaning they absorb moisture.  When the material that's about to be extruded in a 3D printer contains moisture, it will essentially boil in the hot-end then create a little bubble that pops out of the nozzle.  This is not only bad for surface appearance, but will cause poor layer bonding which can be disastrous for structural parts.



How exactly will we address the problems?
Diameter: We will implement a 2-way laser gauge.  This is a non-contact measuring method that will check the diameter from two different angles (90 degrees apart).  This will also ensure that the roundness is within spec.
Debris: Cleanliness is perhaps our main focus.  This is in no small part due to our fair share of unclogging hot-ends.  We're designing custom in-house systems to tightly control the logistics of the raw pellets.  We're also creating methods to ensure that the raw pellets coming into the factory get cleaned before entering any equipment.
Plastic source: For the past 2 years, we've used plastic filament from over a dozen sources in various printers and even pushed it through a few different types of hot-ends.  We've narrowed down the type of raw plastic that just works.
Moisture: To ensure the raw plastic material is free from H2O, every single pellet will travel through a drying system before entering the filament extruder.  To make sure moisture doesn't get into the product after we make it, each spool of filament will get vacuum sealed with a packet of dessicant.

What We Need & What You Get
We're asking for $20,000 to help cover some of the cost for equipment, raw materials in bulk, factory space and hiring skilled local operators. In return, not only do you get high quality, lower cost, home-grown filament, you'll be helping us bring this filament to the entire 3D printing community!
Your contributions will go towards an industrial size plastic extrusion production line (big!), several tons of virgin ABS pellets (heavy!), supplies such as spools, labels and bags, factory space, and most importantly, a skilled operator (brave!).

What will we be making and why?
Type: At this time, we're going to only produce ABS filament.  We personally enjoy printing with ABS for its extruding characteristics (less oozing), mechanical properties (less brittle and squeaky), chemical properties (acetone-fusing smaller parts to make big ones), and post-processing ease (acetone vapor washes are just fantastic).  Our central Ohio 3D printing community also seems to favor ABS.  We understand that PLA is also a very popular material along with the growing use of Nylon.  So, we will not rule out producing this material in the future, perhaps with a second extruder to guarantee material purity.

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">HELLO and thank you for your time in reading this~</span></h4><h4>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My name is Micqa and my clothing/design label is Wysterium Wear, formerly Wisp~her Wear as I now work in Men's, Women's and Children's.   I </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">produce and design costumes, custom pieces, everyday wear, accessories, home decor, reconstruction</span><span style=""font-weight: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">, alterations</span><span style=""font-weight: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">, tailoring, and pretty much anything to do with sewing or textiles.  </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; background-color: initial;"">I have been doing this work for 18 years and have come to a point where I don't have the time to replicate these pieces anymore.  Over the many years, I have had more orders than I can fulfill on my own.     </span>
</h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This campaign idea began when my suitcase was stolen out of my vehicle in San Francisco after a local vending event.  They broke the window and took my beautiful victorian suitcase which had my handmade, one-of-a-kind designed and detailed pieces in it.  This was about 8 years worth of my laborious work.  (10 of those pieces were bought from Buffalo Exchange on Haight street even though I had called to warn them about it prior to)  It was a huge loss in many ways, which cost me alot of time and money.  (many of the items shown in pictures below were in that suitcase)</span></h4><h4>
<span style=""font-weight: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Therefore, this strange way of seeking recovery is new to me, yet it would allow me to work on new designs while marketing the many others I have already done.  Outsourcing will allow me to promote my work and others in the form of fashion shows, photo-shoots and movie productions. Currently, there are three magnificent stores on the west coast that desire to carry Wysterium Wear clothing. </span>
</h4><h4>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I have produced and directed 3 fashion shows and designed for many other ones.  My pieces were used in a film by Paul Festa called ""The Glitter Emergency"".  I have accomplished many successful photoshoots in working with outstandingly talented fashion industry members from various places.  I have 1 design which was entered into the San Francisco De Young museum, and  3 new magazine publications... Cloud Orchid, Dark Beauty and Gothic Beauty.   Please check them out. </span>
</h4><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">               </span></h4>
<p><strong>I am asking for this amount in hopes that I can find a company who can cohesively work with this for the amount of items I wish to reproduce.         </strong></p><p><strong>If this all manifests, I would then be able to take the necessary steps in building~ to have many designs available for on-line shopping and various boutiques.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If I don't reach my goal, I will then invest any other amount into finding a company to at least fulfill the perks i have listed here~ and any remainder  (if any) would go to starting over from the loss and the continuation to make new pieces.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I believe my clothing has something to offer everyone.  It is a story with many characters.  I can make anything to suit yours with varying color, sizes, fabric and artistic touch.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>I thank you all in advance.  </strong></p><p><strong>Even if you are not able to contribute, I am happy to know if my work is appreciated.  I would please ask if you could pass on the word to all of your friends, family and loved ones.</strong></p>

<p></p></div>","HELLO and thank you for your time in reading this~
My name is Micqa and my clothing/design label is Wysterium Wear, formerly Wisp~her Wear as I now work in Men's, Women's and Children's.   I produce and design costumes, custom pieces, everyday wear, accessories, home decor, reconstruction, alterations, tailoring, and pretty much anything to do with sewing or textiles.  I have been doing this work for 18 years and have come to a point where I don't have the time to replicate these pieces anymore.  Over the many years, I have had more orders than I can fulfill on my own.     
This campaign idea began when my suitcase was stolen out of my vehicle in San Francisco after a local vending event.  They broke the window and took my beautiful victorian suitcase which had my handmade, one-of-a-kind designed and detailed pieces in it.  This was about 8 years worth of my laborious work.  (10 of those pieces were bought from Buffalo Exchange on Haight street even though I had called to warn them about it prior to)  It was a huge loss in many ways, which cost me alot of time and money.  (many of the items shown in pictures below were in that suitcase)
Therefore, this strange way of seeking recovery is new to me, yet it would allow me to work on new designs while marketing the many others I have already done.  Outsourcing will allow me to promote my work and others in the form of fashion shows, photo-shoots and movie productions. Currently, there are three magnificent stores on the west coast that desire to carry Wysterium Wear clothing. 

I have produced and directed 3 fashion shows and designed for many other ones.  My pieces were used in a film by Paul Festa called ""The Glitter Emergency"".  I have accomplished many successful photoshoots in working with outstandingly talented fashion industry members from various places.  I have 1 design which was entered into the San Francisco De Young museum, and  3 new magazine publications... Cloud Orchid, Dark Beauty and Gothic Beauty.   Please check them out. 
               
I am asking for this amount in hopes that I can find a company who can cohesively work with this for the amount of items I wish to reproduce.         If this all manifests, I would then be able to take the necessary steps in building~ to have many designs available for on-line shopping and various boutiques.
If I don't reach my goal, I will then invest any other amount into finding a company to at least fulfill the perks i have listed here~ and any remainder  (if any) would go to starting over from the loss and the continuation to make new pieces.


I believe my clothing has something to offer everyone.  It is a story with many characters.  I can make anything to suit yours with varying color, sizes, fabric and artistic touch.  
I thank you all in advance.  Even if you are not able to contribute, I am happy to know if my work is appreciated.  I would please ask if you could pass on the word to all of your friends, family and loved ones.
You can visit me on Facebook, (please click like if you do) & Model Mayhem.My website is www.wysteriumwear.com.  It is currently under construction.   :)
Thanks again! 
Sincerely
Micqa~

Since development work of the product is complete, work can begin on tooling and production once this crowdfunding campaign is over (mid-September) and funds received from IndieGoGo (1-2 weeks thereafter).  Once received it will immediately go towards the deposit on the tooling.  Tooling has been estimated to be 4-6 weeks and production at 2 weeks. Fulfillment of the perks will be during the first half of December, if everything else goes as planned.





The TIHK will proudly be Made in the USA and support American workers.









As with bringing any product to market, there may be unforeseen challenges that occur while bringing the TIHK towards the proverbial product development finish line.  Our team has many years of bringing products to market, particularly in the shooting, hunting and outdoor market. The biggest risk is schedule creep due to issues that arise while tooling the product. We've done extensive sourcing and qualification to ensure that those risks can be mitigated if they occur.

If you are interested in TIHK wholesale, we encourage you to look at our Retail Starter Kit perk as a way to evaluate the product in your selling environment.  Once we have finished fulfilling all project perks (including the Retail Starter Kits) we will transition to developing distribution of the product through multiple channels with standard keystone pricing. If you are interested in future wholesale options please fill out our interest form.
The TIHK is to only be used to counter illegal detainment and in accordance with all local, state and federal laws by trained law enforcement, military and security professionals. Improper use by civilians is not endorsed or encouraged. Use of the product is at your own personal risk and discretion. 



What material is the TIHK made of?  The exact material is not finalized at this point but will be during the course of the campaign. We are evaluating various die-casting allows such as zinc, magnesium and aluminum but also high-strength reinforced polymers. The final material will most certainly be resistant to corrosion and be as lightweight as possible (currently between 1/3 to 1 gram depending on material).
What color will the TIHK be? The TIHK will have a dark, low-visibility finish to ensure no unwanted attention is drawn to it.


What is the legality of the TIHK? We encourage civilians to investigate the law in their own jurisdiction. It is typically not against the law to own or possess a handcuff key as a civilian, however, using such an implement to evade law enforcement is certainly unlawful. Let us be clear: This product is not designed to be used to evade law enforcement.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Stacey K. Clarke, and I love who I am. I grew up in a beautiful city where I heard that beauty meant my physical worth to a man. After bouts of one sided relationships, disordered eating, depression, and being obsessed with how I looked, God pulled me out and showed me that I am made in His image with His attributes! He called me Beautiful, and it stuck!</p>
<p>Lily Inc. is here to show women that their beauty (inside that flows to the outside) is powerful, purposeful, and unique. There is no such thing as a standard they have to fit.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With a background in campus ministry, fundraising, and business administration, I am excited to involve you in Lily Inc.'s first major round of fundraising to get things off the ground! </span></p>

<p>We are raising $10,000 for this first major round of seed money. This money will be primarily used to support me while I work with Redeemer Presbyterian's Entrepreneurial Initiative and other wise advisors to create and carry out a viable business plan. The plan includes opening the online store, the physical store, and a conjoined cafe. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I believe God could provide all I need without my help. But I also believe it is His delight to involve us just so He can bless us! By contributing, you will sow into the lives of women as well as into ushering in a new mindset for a generation. God will surely bless your heart to give, both now and in eternity. And as a thank you from me, you'll also get a 20% off coupon for Lily's future launch.</span></p>
<p>And what will happen if we do not raise the full amount? Lily will get to keep whatever funds are raised, but we really need that $10K! So please sow a financial seed, knowing that a woman knowing what she's worth is what it's all about!</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span></p>
<p>We have a generation of young women who are numb to their value. Giving their beauty to men who manipulate them, hardening their hearts for fear of being used, thinking that they have to straighten, curl, dye skin, and MAN up. Tragic given the beauty and power that is inside us.</p>
<p>Opening an encouraging company in the center of an industry that tells them they are less-than is like putting TNT into an immovable mountain. Major impact! Bam.</p>
<p>To date, I have raised a small amount of funding to simply begin advertising Lily Inc. so people know it exists. These funds have been used to get graphic design help and to cover the Business Plan competition fees. This next round will enable me to really make Lily Inc. come alive!</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>THE PAST </strong></p>
<p>We had the idea, A GREAT IDEA!  Empowering and igniting the masses to get involved in spreading awareness for many causes that affect a broad spectrum of individuals. By offering a product that will allow supporters to make a cause driven fashion statement! The BONUS - IT'S FUN &amp; IT'S STYLISH! INVITING ALL TO FLIP YOUR FLOP FOR A CAUSE!                                                              </p>
<p><strong>THE PRESENT</strong></p>
<p>We are six months into the life of Healthy Souls Apparel and we have experienced an unfathomable momentum and overwhelming support on our mission and vision . The word of our brand and awareness spread so quickly, and soon even though we received  feedback that our product was extremely comfortable the next logical discussion was on how to improve our product even more and to make it even better based on supporters feedback. </p>
<p>We didn’t want our product to just represent these causes, but we wanted to offer the most durable, high quality product that would be manufactured with environmentally responsible materials. We didn’t want to be a part of the problem, but rather a part of the solution. We realized that our approach to  manufacturing was creating a lot of waste and product materials were being imported. So we decided to do something to change all of that.</p>
<p><strong>THE FUTURE</strong></p>
<p>We have now partnered with a manufactuer that is not only environmentally responsible, but they will make all of our products using 100% recyclable materials and they will do it all HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. It's Healthy Souls dream to be a catalyst to how business is done and products are offered. Impact from the beginning, change lives along the way, be environmentally friendly, and YET have it all produced and manufactured in the USA. </p>
<p><strong>This is where you come in! </strong></p>
<p>We are now in the process of moving forward to bring all of this into reality and releasing our new 2013 line of flip flops with our new supplier.  It is the vision of Healthy Souls to offer a flip flop high in quality, durability, 100% recyclable materials and made in USA all the while spreading awareness. </p>
<p>It is your support that will fund all start up costs with new manufacturer, costs for setting new machines, product design and product samples and materials for the 2013 launch.</p>

<h2><strong><em>The Story of the Doggie Doo All</em></strong></h2>
<h3>Hello fellow dog lovers!</h3>
<p>WOOF, WOOF, WOOF!!!</p>
<p>We're Laura Vorreyer and Lawrence Jordan, aka Team Doo All, and WE LOVE DOGS!</p>
<p>Laura has been a professional dog walker and pet sitter in the Los Angeles area for the last 10 years. She completely enjoys working with dogs.  Honestly, the only part she dislikes is picking up after them and really, who likes that?</p>
<p>Lawrence is a film editor by trade, having worked in Hollywood for over 20 years. He has also has a background in marketing, creating web properties, and working with social media since its earliest beginnings. </p>
<p> <img alt=""Laura, Larry and Doggies"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.doggiedooall.com/images/lldogs.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Doggie Doo All Partners""/></p>
<h3>
<strong>AN A-HA! MOMENT</strong> </h3>
<p>It's pretty simple, really.</p>
<p>Out on a dog walk one day, Laura realized what was missing from the standard leash attachement which dispenses only a poop pick up bag was something she could clean her hands with. As a mom she had been using sanitizing wipes for years and loved their ease and convienience. So she went out to purchase an attachment which included a bag AND a wipe, but to her surprise, nothing like it existed. She began thinking, ""Why don't I develop this myself?""</p>
<p>So she began to work on developing the Doggie Doo All. As a single Mom and on the budget of a dog walker, she wasn't getting very far.

The Story of the Doggie Doo All
Hello fellow dog lovers!
WOOF, WOOF, WOOF!!!
We're Laura Vorreyer and Lawrence Jordan, aka Team Doo All, and WE LOVE DOGS!
Laura has been a professional dog walker and pet sitter in the Los Angeles area for the last 10 years. She completely enjoys working with dogs.  Honestly, the only part she dislikes is picking up after them and really, who likes that?
Lawrence is a film editor by trade, having worked in Hollywood for over 20 years. He has also has a background in marketing, creating web properties, and working with social media since its earliest beginnings. 
 

AN A-HA! MOMENT 
It's pretty simple, really.
Out on a dog walk one day, Laura realized what was missing from the standard leash attachement which dispenses only a poop pick up bag was something she could clean her hands with. As a mom she had been using sanitizing wipes for years and loved their ease and convienience. So she went out to purchase an attachment which included a bag AND a wipe, but to her surprise, nothing like it existed. She began thinking, ""Why don't I develop this myself?""
So she began to work on developing the Doggie Doo All. As a single Mom and on the budget of a dog walker, she wasn't getting very far. It was quite frustrating knowing that she had a really great idea but no way to bring it to market without funding.  She was determined to move forward an inch everyday and figure out a way to bring her product to the marketplace.  She began to work on market research and prototypes and joined inventor groups.  Still, she was frustrated, it seemed that without a miracle, she wouldn't ever see the Doggie Doo All come to life.  
In 2012 Laura met Lawrence and they fell in love. It just so happened that he also shared her passion for the product and they decided to partner and bring the Doggie Doo All to market together.

AND THE DOGGIE DOO ALL WAS BORN!
The Doggie Doo All is a CONVENIENT, lightweight, easy to use, refillable leash attachment which dispenses a poop picking up bag AND a hand sanitizing wipe. Nothing like it exists in the market place and we have a patent on it.
The wipe can be used in so many ways besides wiping your hands.  Like, wiping your dog, your shoe, your shirt...really any thing you want to clean quickly.

<p><strong>Introducing A Mindful Clothing Swap, With Proceeds Going To Women In Need </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are so excited to share a new project that truly inspires us.  We are producing an event that will connect like-minded women in Vancouver through fun, community contribution and a love of having something new to wear.   Lots of women have a ton of great clothing sitting in the back of their closets, which never get worn.  At the same time, there are many women living in the Downtown Eastside that don’t have access to the necessary clothing for life.<br/> Meanwhile, the clothes remain sitting in the back of our closets... </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been hosting swaps for the last 7 years.  It started with a handful of friends and grew into a small community.  Attendees purge their closets by pulling out items that they haven't worn in a while and know that it's time that they parted ways.  These pieces get pooled with the others and are arranged by apparel categories.  On “the go” everyone choses the new garments they would like to take home.  This is the fun part… free clothes!  Not everything is taken and we fill bins of unclaimed apparel to give away, often to half way homes.  We can only imagine what we could contribute, with hundreds of attendees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The format for this February’s event will be:  Swappers will drop off a bag of clothes and apparel items prior to the event so they can be categorized and racked.  Additionally, each guest will be asked to give one business or business casual outfit to be allocated to our agency partners serving women in the Downtown Eastside.  By event day, we will have collected a bag of apparel for the swapping portion of the night and an outfit for women in need from each guest.  Upon arrival at the SWAP<ins cite=""mailto:Brooke%20Van%20Hatten"" datetime=""2013-01-10T18:36""> </ins>on February 12<sup>th</sup>, contributors will receive a bag to fill for themselves and if they wish to acquire more items, a second bag can be purchased for $20.  We are committed that there will be lots of great clothes available to swap as well as hundreds of outfits, apparel items and cash proceeds delivered to our agency partners.   </p>

<p><strong>SWAP</strong> is gearing up to be one of the biggest Clothing Swaps Vancouver has ever seen, taking place at the Old Boneta Space 1 W Cordova St on Tuesday February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2013 at 6pm.  Our goal is to have 200 women attend, swap and have fun while amassing hundreds of outfits for women in need.  We are working with: The Downtown Eastside Women’s Center, Crabtree Corner and WISH.  We are focusing our production on three components:</p>
<p>1)      <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Acquiring outfits for women entering or re-entering the work force</span>.  A selection of those outfits will be unveiled and celebrated during our fashion show.</p>
<p>2)      <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Creating a compassionate awareness around women in need.</span>  Guest speakers representing our agency partners will speak at the event about their organization, the women in their communities and be on hand to answer any questions.  A “Host Your Own Swap” postcard will be given to each guest to encourage future, mindful swaps.</p>

</h3></div>","WHAT IS NEMESIS?
Nemesis is the first of Zenit Miniatures games, set in the fantastic world of Miter, where creatures, heroes, alchemists and mysterious beings dwell, where its towns grow, develop, fight and sometimes disappear without trace.
 
                                ARMIES
ORPHANS   
Little bugs. Little children. Nobody knows. The only truth is they don't want anybody in their forests, disturbing their games.

 
ROCAVIVAS   
They have been living in the deep jungle, and under it, for centuries, never worried about the rest of Miter. But the rest of Miter is now interested in them. In fact, interested in their wealth. Naive, soon they'll learn to fear those ""little women"".

NOT ALIVE    
They can move, they can think... but they are not alive. Experts of the ancient science of Serifans, live is the only mistery they are interested on. And will find it. No matter if they have to vivisect every creature in Miter.

 
THOUSAND FACES CULT    
Barbarians, monsters and beasts. In the volcanic islands of the Interior Sea, there is no place for weakness. Every newborn must survive to the implantation of the rocks. Every child must survive to the proofs asigned by their strict parents. Every adult must become a warrior.

 
KINGDOM OF GOD     
It is said there is a god. Only one god. It is said Queen Joana hears his words. And in their duty to show the truth to every people in Miter, they will be capable of destroying it all.

<p>Hexoskin Smart is a sensor-embedded smart shirt that monitors and records your <b>heart rate, breathing, and movement</b> whether you're awake or asleep. It provides valuable insights on intensity and recovery, calories burned, fatigue level, and sleep quality. Hexoskin connects to your favorite Bluetooth Smart compatible apps and devices (Hexoskin supports the BLE HR profile). All of your data is stored securely, allowing you to see how your physical fitness is evolving over time.</p>
<p>Hexoskin Smart is a great alternative to bulky heart rate monitors that can quickly get uncomfortable in many situations. Our shirt is made out of fabric imported from Italy, is extremely comfortable, durable, odor-resistant, and even safe to use in contact sports.</p>

<p>You probably know more about your car's health than about your own. That’s crazy! We're on a mission to change this. We want every human being on Earth to be able to collect and share their health data anywhere, anytime. This is why we created the Hexoskin smart shirt.

<p>Your Hexoskin Smart device starts collecting high quality data as soon as it’s plugged into your shirt. All of this data is securely synced to the cloud so that you can review it on your dashboard, download it, and even share it with others, such as your coaches, your healthcare professional, and even your loved ones.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/GLQpFOC7NyE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div><br/>Alex Sy praises the precision of Hexoskin's data and the fact that he can share his data with his coach.<p></p>
<p>To see your data in real time, you can simply pair your Hexoskin to a Bluetooth Smart compatible device, such as your smartphone, tablet, GPS sports watch, or bike computer. While the Hexoskin app will display your full cardiac, breathing, and movement data, 3rd-party apps like Strava and Runkeeper will mostly use Hexoskin Smart as a Heart Rate Monitor (HRM), displaying and recording your heart rate. We recommend that you keep using the app that you’re most comfortable with.</p>

<p>Your data is collected by the sensors embedded in the shirt and sent to the small Hexoskin Smart device that sits discreetly in your side pocket. This device records all your raw data, whether or not you have your phone nearby. When you have a phone or tablet in range, the Hexoskin Smart device will stream your data in real-time to your phone’s display.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0284/7802/files/Hexoskin-Indiegogo-Page-Images-Screens.jpg?5866089663885107140"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>If your phone is connected to the internet by Wifi or a data plan, your data is also sent to our servers, where it is securely stored.

<p><b>2006</b> - The brainchild of our two co-founders, Pierre-Alexandre Fournier and Jean-François Roy, Hexoskin started as an idea over 10 years ago. Since 2006, our team has been conducting extensive Research &amp; Development to bring you the World’s Leading Smart Shirt.</p>
<p><b>2011</b> - Our big break came when we were awarded with our first contract from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) to provide a smart shirt for astronauts living aboard the International Space Station. This contract jump-started an ongoing relationship between the CSA and Hexoskin for the continued development of technology in order to prepare for human space exploration. It also opened doors for contracts with other reputable organizations such as NASA, and other government agencies.</p>
<p><b>2013</b> - Our first commercial smart shirt, Hexoskin Classic, went into production following a successful launch through our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, backed by government agencies, professional sports associations, wearable technology enthusiasts, casual athletes, and more from across the globe!</p>
<p>Since then, we've shipped thousands of Hexoskin shirts and devices around the world to athletes, coaches, researchers, mad scientists, miners, astronauts, adventurers, and people like you and me who would like to know how our body performs and recovers in different situations and environments.</p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div>","Hexoskin Smart is a sensor-embedded smart shirt that monitors and records your heart rate, breathing, and movement whether you're awake or asleep. It provides valuable insights on intensity and recovery, calories burned, fatigue level, and sleep quality. Hexoskin connects to your favorite Bluetooth Smart compatible apps and devices (Hexoskin supports the BLE HR profile). All of your data is stored securely, allowing you to see how your physical fitness is evolving over time.
Hexoskin Smart is a great alternative to bulky heart rate monitors that can quickly get uncomfortable in many situations. Our shirt is made out of fabric imported from Italy, is extremely comfortable, durable, odor-resistant, and even safe to use in contact sports.

Hexoskin Smart connects natively to a wide range of GPS sports watches, allowing you to leave your phone at home.


Yes, we're back! As you may remember, we brought you the World’s First Biometric Smart Shirt in 2013, with an amazing response here on Indiegogo that saw us reach 166% of our goal! We’re now bringing you Hexoskin Smart, the World’s First Biometric Smart Shirt compatible with your favorite fitness tracking apps like Strava, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Endomondo, and MapMyRun.  We appreciated your support in 2013 so much that we decided that you should be the first to benefit from the discounted launch price of our newest technology: Hexoskin Smart.

To help you know more about your health
You probably know more about your car's health than about your own. That’s crazy! We're on a mission to change this. We want every human being on Earth to be able to collect and share their health data anywhere, anytime. This is why we created the Hexoskin smart shirt. Join us in helping shape the future of smart clothing, and revolutionizing the way people take care of their health. Claim your perk now!

Your Hexoskin Smart device starts collecting high quality data as soon as it’s plugged into your shirt. All of this data is securely synced to the cloud so that you can review it on your dashboard, download it, and even share it with others, such as your coaches, your healthcare professional, and even your loved ones.Alex Sy praises the precision of Hexoskin's data and the fact that he can share his data with his coach.
To see your data in real time, you can simply pair your Hexoskin to a Bluetooth Smart compatible device, such as your smartphone, tablet, GPS sports watch, or bike computer. While the Hexoskin app will display your full cardiac, breathing, and movement data, 3rd-party apps like Strava and Runkeeper will mostly use Hexoskin Smart as a Heart Rate Monitor (HRM), displaying and recording your heart rate. We recommend that you keep using the app that you’re most comfortable with.
Data Flow

Your data is collected by the sensors embedded in the shirt and sent to the small Hexoskin Smart device that sits discreetly in your side pocket. This device records all your raw data, whether or not you have your phone nearby. When you have a phone or tablet in range, the Hexoskin Smart device will stream your data in real-time to your phone’s display.If your phone is connected to the internet by Wifi or a data plan, your data is also sent to our servers, where it is securely stored. This allows you to review your data whenever you want.


We've worked all year long to design new hardware that now includes a Bluetooth Smart chip. This new technology opens up Hexoskin to be used with your favorite 3rd party apps, devices, and platforms, allowing you to use world's most comfortable and accurate wearable heart rate monitor without changing your habits.

Hexoskin compatible apps
Seamlessly integrate your Hexoskin data into your favorite fitness apps such as Runkeeper, Strava, Endomondo, MapMyRun, Runtastic, etc.

“We are pleased that Hexoskin smart clothing is now compatible with Strava,” remarked David Lorsch, VP Strategy & Business Development at Strava. “When paired with Strava, Hexoskin Smart will help our users better understand their athletic performance and recovery.”

Hexoskin compatible devices
Don’t want to bring your smartphone on your next run or ride? No problem! If your bike computer or sports watch is compatible with Bluetooth Smart heart rate monitors, then you're good to go with your Hexoskin Smart shirt and device, without any other device!

Compatible devices include the Tomtom Runner, the Suunto Ambit3, the Wahoo line of bike computers, and more!

New York Times

""For runners who don't want to be encumbered by smartbands and chest straps, Hexoskin is a body metric system with several sensors woven into a shirt that measure heart rate, breathing, steps, pace and calories.""

Sports Illustrated

""These shirts are designed to give athletes the same sort of data they could get from a performance lab—for example, heart rate recovery and lung capacity—but in more natural environments and without needing to be hooked up to a machine.""

Yahoo

""The Hexoskin tank top can do anything a wrist-worn wearable is capable of with the added benefit of spot-on lung capacity readings, measured by its breathing sensors.""

WIRED

""Well, wearables are about to explode into an array of novel, single-function devices. They will suit discrete situations rather than peeling off multiple functions from your phone—it’s use-case engineering. Think of activity-specific clothing, like Hexoskin, that monitors workouts.""

Huffington Post

""T-shirts and trousers that will be able to measure our health parameters in the most convenient way. Keep an eye on: Hexoskin.""

Digital Trends

""Hexoskin is a great product, capable of accurately tracking an array of biometric data.""

Live Science

""With this shirt, there's no need to strap on a fitness tracker.""

Bike Rumor

""When a heart rate monitor just won’t cut it, there is a new crop of “smart shirts.” More than simply a heart rate monitor, Hexoskin’s Smart Shirts use built in sensor technology to monitor Heart Rate Variability (HRV), breathing rate, minute ventilation, Heart Rate Recovery, Cadence, even an estimated Vo2 max and more.""


Here are a few screenshots of what the activity reports within the Hexoskin app look like. Some activities, like Running, Cycling, and Sleeping have specific reports.
Running
Are all runs created equal? We know the answer is no, but what makes a good run, and how does one run compare to your others? By using the Running Activity in your Hexoskin app, you’ll get answers to these questions and more. On top of being able to view your running route drawn on a map, distance ran, and pace, you can see the calories burned during your run, your heart rate (HR,) your HR zones and how long you were in each zone, and your breathing volume. Remember: the more you breathe, the faster and further you can run.

</div></div>","Introducing Wander

Why the word Wander?

When we think of the word 'wander', we think of freedom to express ourselves and our feelings which we now refer to as #letthelovewander


People are often concerned with how they are perceived which limits their true desire to be happy.


Our goal is to have Wander build a community that is synonymous with kindness and positivity.

Material

We make all our bracelets with semi-precious gemstones. 



The reason we started with gemstone is because each gemstone has specific spiritual properties that promote energy healing and positivity which coincides perfectly with our #letthelovewander mission.


All our products include 14k Gold Filled beads, 14k Rose Gold Filled beads, .925 Sterling Silver beads, Rhodium plated beads, and CZ Diamond beads.


Craftsmanship

We've spent the last year sourcing the highest quality semi-precious gemstones from all around the world to offer you unparalleled quality.

We've studied ancient jewelry making techniques to handcraft each Wander product to stand the test of time. 


Fair Pricing

By selling directly to you online we are able to cut our costs and return that money back to you by offering you our premium accessories starting at 75% less than our luxury brand counterparts.










Our #letthelovewander mission

We started Wander Jewelry because of our desire to help connect and encourage people to be more thoughtful and caring to those around them.

Jewelry has always been a symbol of affection so Wander offers you a perfect opportunity to not only wear something stylish for every occasion, but to also pay it forward with a special act of kindness every single time you purchase a Wander product.


We've always loved accessories, but finding affordable high quality pieces that last has always been a struggle.


Accessories with the same level of quality as Wander typically retail starting at $300-$400 and go up into the $1000s for each product. 

We want to change that. 

We want to help change the world one person, one message at a time so we have lowered our prices to have an even greater impact by having more people involved in our mission.





   What We Need & What You Get

Your contributions will allow us to turn our dream into reality. Your initial pledges will go towards funding the supplies for our first large production order. 

By being one of the first to purchase our accessories you are getting a reduced price as a show of our appreciation for helping us on our journey to spread our #letthelovewander mission.

As much as we love your pledges, we'd also love it if you can share our campaign with your friends and social networks to help us reach as many people as possible. 
Something as simple as clicking the social share buttons at the top left of the page and promoting our campaign on your networks can really go along way in getting our accessories exposure and helping us try to make the world a better place. 









How do I select a specific style after I've paid for my pledge?

Once you've paid and filled out all your information we'll email you within 24-48 hours with a reference number and directions to our website so you can select the exact product and size you want.


Once on the website you will be able to select between Men's and Women's styles.





How do I giveaway a free bracelet?

Once you've made your payment you have to think of someone that you'd like to give the bracelet to. 


We want you to really take the time and say why that person means a lot to you so that when they read it they are truly happy and touched.


You'll have to upload any image to your Instagram account and tag that person so they can see that you wrote something special about them.

You also have to tag us @wanderjewelry so that we know exactly who to contact regarding the free bracelet. If you do not tag us we will not be aware of your post and will not be able to find the person to give them their free bracelet.

Since our accessories won't ship for 6-8 weeks following the end of the campaign you can get started uploading images right now without wearing our products and we will deliver the free giveaway bracelets at the same time we ship all your pledges.



Sizes

You can pick your size after you've made your purchase. You'll be able to do this when you are selecting your specific style bracelet.



    Please Note

Delivery Times

Since our products are made by hand it will take 6-8 weeks following the completion of our campaign before we start shipping your products.

If we experience a higher than expected sales volume, shipping can possibly be delayed. We will keep you updated if the situation arises.

Duties

If you live outside the US you will be responsible for any duty/ VAT charges.

Customs

Some countries have slower customs processes than others so if your packages are held up and shipment is delayed we apologize, but unfortunately it does happen at times.

<b><br/></b><p><b>How it all began:</b><br/><br/>We always loves  Arduino because Arduino is powerful and flexible, Arduino IDE and libraries can be used from miniature to mega scale projects.  Some projects just don't want the power of a full fledged ATmega328.  If you need to make a thermostat relay controller or a simple start up timer for your appliances.  ATmega's is big for that, the ATtiny is more than enough for the task.</p>
<p> If we need to program ATtiny chips we need breadboard with jumper wires with proper pin diagrams  valuable time connecting the breadboard to arduino board with jumpers. and we need to do that every project.</p>
<p> The problem is that trying to program a bare ATtiny looks like the picture below.  Also you need to remove the chip from your connected circuit each time you want to upload a new sketch disturbing the jumpers and troubleshooting when programing next time..</p>

These room-by-room video guides of essential projects, products, and techniques will set the bar for Home Safety.Once funding is obtained, the Institute will produce videos that will be geared directly for use in the homes of Alzheimer’s patients and their caregivers.  Videos will start with “How to Assess Your Home’s Safety and Accessibility” and then highlight specific areas and products that can be used throughout the home as the patient’s Alzheimer’s Disease progress. As Alzheimer’s patients' needs change, so do the home safety needs of the caregiver.The videos will be about lighting, kitchen design, bathroom design, and flooring ..to name a few. By adjusting these areas in your home, your seniors will be able to remain in their living quarters. These downloadable videos will be free of charge and user friendly. They can help prevent a number of common accidents that may occur around the house. We are asking you for your donation to help raise the money necessary to film this content.

<p>To date, we have invested in Citrus ties so as

</div></div>","Citrus ties believes in the implementation of ideas
emanating from the individual and reaching the crowd. For this reason, we are
starting a campaign to raise funding from the public, by means of which we want
to cover some of the costs required for the development of our project, namely,
the purchase of raw materials for the next collection, the creation of a
website and e-shop, and the establishment of a showroom to display citrus ties.

Purchase of new materials

For the selection of the fabric which will be
used to sew each citrus tie, we do research in various shops and warehouses.
Each fabric is selected based on its uniqueness and quality. Apart from the cost
of raw materials, this research also entails transportation expenses -
sometimes even outside Attica.




Website and e-shop development


Upon completion of the campaign, we would like
to create our website and e-shop in order to display our citrus ties collection. www.citrusties.com 
Establishment of showroom
For all those who would like to meet us, or come
to see and try our ties, we would like to establish a showroom where they will
be able to do so.

Development of women's collection - head- and neck scarves 

If we surpass our initial goal, we will have
the opportunity to develop our women’s collection of head- and neck scarves, using
equally unique fabrics.








At Citrus ties we like to plan our next steps.
Planning enables us to set realistic goals in the development of our venture and
control the level of their achievement.  
To date, we have invested in Citrus ties so as
to produce the current collection *(autumn - winter 2014-2015).
This investment is broken down in sewing
machines, raw materials (textiles and metal elements) and packaging
construction. The investment which has been made so far will hopefully be
recouped from future sales.
By means of the financial campaign, we would
like to cover first its expenditure and then the cost of the raw materials of
the upcoming collection (spring - summer 2015), as well as to start developing the
women’s collection of head- and neck scarves, made of unique fabrics.
The amount that we aim to collect will be
allocated as follows: 
a. Purchase of raw materials (30%) 
b. Creation of a website and store (15%) 
c. Establishment of a showroom (30%) 
d. Campaign expenses (15 ~ 20%) 
Campaign expenses include the cost of IndieGoGo
platform (5-9%) and the cost to run the campaign - photoshooting, video,
reciprocal cost (about 10%). 
All these bring us to the amount of 10,000€.
If we manage to surpass this goal and reach 15,000€,

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Repurpose – What are we doing here?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The results relied upon for this campaign will allow Rewondered to replenish resources and receive revenue, in order to reveal new product lines and wedding designs using repurposed materials, reclaim supplies that are in storage, reconnect with customers and fans in person, redesign formal wear and wedding dresses, and rediscover new markets.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Rewondered – What is Rewondered?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><a href=""http://www.rewondered.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rewondered</a> is a one-woman handmade fashion business specializing in items for anyone who wants to express their style in a distinctive and unconventional fashion.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">When I decided to start my own business, I wanted it to express my creativity, as well as do some small part to save the world (I'm not a superhero in real life, but I play one online). I started designing jewelry using a variety of new and used materials, old broken pieces, found objects, leftover craft supplies, and anything else I thought was interesting. I try to reuse and recycle as much as possible, thus keeping perfectly good objects out of the landfills. I love taking something that could be considered “junk” and “rewondering” it into something... well, wonderful.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I have been planning to expand my product lines for some time, but Rewondered took a bit of a back seat when I relocated to New Hampshire last summer. However, I now have a studio restored and I'm ready to start reinvigorating my business. I'm getting remarried in August, and plan to make as much of the attire and decorations for the wedding as possible, so these designs will also be incorporated into my new product lines. In addition, I'm planning to start a line of “rewondered” wedding and prom dresses. I would love to create one-of-a-kind pieces for other brides and special occasions. A once-in-a-lifetime day deserves a once-in-a-lifetime dress!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Request – How Can You Help?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">My campaign here on Indiegogo respectfully requests your assistance in helping me get these product lines made and available for sale. I think everyone deserves to express their own distinctive style however they wish, and it's my goal to provide them with products that can help them do so. I love doing custom work, and particularly look forward to helping brides bring their vision of their perfect wedding to life.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">There are several phases to my plans for Rewondered, and this campaign's goal is to raise money for the first phase, at least. Additional funds raised will allow me to implement additional phases. All money raised will go toward Rewondered's expansion plans and operating expenses. If I don't reach my fund-raising goal, I'll implement as much as I can and any leftover monies will pay for things like listing fees and supplies.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Reveal – Phase 1</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I'll be adding pictures to the gallery here of my new designs as I get them made, with a goal of one new item for each day of the campaign.  Here are just a few of the new product ideas I'm working on: earrings, bracelets, corset jewelry, corsets and waist cinchers, shrugs and jackets, skirts, tutus and petticoats, bustles and overskirts, vests, jabots and neckties, fabric and paper flowers, brooch bouquets, boutonnieres, framed text-based art prints, veils, fascinators, wedding favors, decorations, key chains, photo booth props, “flair” (buttons or pins), and various bags. Posting 500 new products on Etsy will cost me $100 for listing fees and one year of my online store subscription is about $240. I will need ink for my printer, labels, cardstock, and plastic bags to create tags and packaging, as well as mailing supplies. I'm estimating another $160 for these. Total Reveal phase: $500.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Reclaim – Phase 2</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">When I moved to New Hampshire, most of my supplies were put into storage in Ohio. This includes tons of old jewelry and beads, scrapbooking paper and embellishments, clothing (including some formal dresses), fabric, miscellaneous craft supplies, and some furniture that I could use in my studio. Phase 2 is reclaiming these supplies and moving them from Ohio to New Hampshire. I am estimating this will cost around $500. Total Reclaim phase: $500. Total of Reveal + Reclaim phases: $1000.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Reconnect – Phase 3</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The next phase is connecting to my customers in person. My goal is to have a table or booth at at least one convention, festival, or fair each month. I would love to return to Ba-Con, which is at the end of June. I am estimating that vending fees and travel will cost approximately $350. I am planning on appearing once a month (June-October) at the Concord Arts Market. This will cost me $200, plus I will be required to have a 10x10 canopy with 25-pound weights for each leg, which I found on Amazon for $188. I'll be looking for things I can buy used and/or repurpose for displays, such as garment racks, wire cubes, jewelry displays, hangers, and mannequins. I'm not sure exactly what I need until I figure out what products I want to take to the shows, so I'll estimate $262 just to bring me to an even $1000 for this phase. Total Reconnect phase: $1000. Total of Reveal + Reclaim + Reconnect phases: $2000.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Redesign – Phase 4</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">This is where I implement the Rewondered Wedding Dress product line. Three adjustable dress forms (small, medium, and large), will give me the ability to customize to a wide range of sizes. These will cost around $300. A portable washing machine that I can use to dye fabrics will cost about $100. I'll need a supply of wedding dresses I can alter, so a $500 shopping spree at various thrift stores should net me 5-10 dresses to start with. I'll also need additional material, trims and embellishments, thread, zippers, etc. so I'm adding another $500 for supplies. Total of Redesign phase: $1400. Total of Reveal + Reclaim + Reconnect + Redesign phases: $3400.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Rediscover – Phase 5</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">While all of the above will help me get my name out there, I'll still need to do some advertising. I want to become a Lifetime Member of OffbeatBride.com ($50) and get listed as a vendor for one year ($345). I've received some good traffic from Facebook and Google ads, so I'd like to try spending $100 a month on each for six months ($1200). Total of Rediscover phase: $1595. Total of Reveal + Reclaim + Reconnect + Redesign + Rediscover phases: $4995</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Repercussions – What will fully funding this campaign accomplish?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">What this will do for me is get my business off its training wheels and riding down the big hill without fear. My dream is to run Rewondered full-time and actually make a living at it.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">What this will do for my customers is get them something uniquely “them” at an affordable price. Those who own my necklaces often get complimented on them. And those who get one of my Rewondered Wedding Dresses can be confident that they are getting a truly unique dress, custom designed to their taste and style, and they're not breaking the budget to get it!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">What this will do for the world is keep more items out of landfills. I will also be offering designs to various charities that I believe in, which they can auction off for their cause, as well as creating special signature pieces where the proceeds will go to a specific charity.  Eventually, when I no longer need to reinvest every penny into my own business, I plan to invest in other people who are trying to start a one-person handmade business on their own.  My ultimate goal is to give back everything I earn through this campaign, and more, to others like me.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">What this will do for you....</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Rewards – What's in it for you?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Ah yes, the perks! First of all, everyone who contributes at least <strong>$5</strong> will have my Regard and receive a special thank you tweet from @Rewondered on <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/rewondered"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> or a thank you post on Rewondered's <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/rewondered"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook Page</a>, as well as their name listed on a special thank you page on my <a href=""http://www.rewondered.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Then we get into the items I will custom make for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a <strong>$20</strong> contribution, you can choose a <strong>necklace</strong> or a<strong> bracelet</strong>, custom made for you with up to 20 charms or beaded sections, or a <strong>Rewondered upcycled bag</strong>.</li>
<li>For a <strong>$25</strong> contribution, I will send you an <strong>autographed 8x10</strong> from my photo shoot last December (see the gallery for options), and a <strong>2-minute recording</strong> of me reading from one of the erotica stories by <a href=""http://www.teresanoelleroberts.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Teresa Noelle Roberts</a>.</li>
<li>For a <strong>$50</strong> contribution, you can choose between a custom made <strong>Rewondered skirt </strong>or <strong>floor-length tutu</strong>, or a <strong>75-piece photo booth prop package</strong>, consisting of new, repurposed and handmade items.</li>
<li>For a <strong>$100</strong> contribution, you can choose either <strong>two bouquets</strong> or <strong>two centerpieces </strong>(or one of each), custom made from a variety of materials such as fabric, paper, brooches, beads, wire, or whatever else your imagination can think up.  I'll work with you to make something truly ""you""-nique.</li>
<li>For a <strong>$500</strong> contribution, you will be one of the first to get a customized <strong>Rewondered Wedding Dress</strong> (or other formal attire) or a customized <strong>Cosplay Outfit</strong> or costume of your choice.</li>
<li>For a <strong>$4995</strong> contribution (and thus funding all 5 phases) I will <strong>Rewonder your entire wedding</strong>. This includes ensembles for the wedding party, such as dresses, jackets, vests, veils or fascinators, headbands or other hair accessories, jabots or neckties, and jewelry. It also includes bouquets, boutonnieres, centerpieces and other decorations, wedding favors, invitations, and programs. I am restricting this to ONE person, with a wedding party of no more than ten people (any combination of brides, grooms, attendants, parents, officiants, etc. In other words, your choice of up to ten people total), a guest list of no more than 200, and a wedding date of no earlier than October 2012 (so I actually have time to work with it in addition to my own wedding in August). You also must agree to provide pictures of your wedding and allow me to use them for promotional purposes (so be sure to discuss that with your photographer, or get some really good candids).  I will also be posting on my blog about my progress on what I'm making for your wedding.  Here is your chance for a handmade wedding, using as many repurposed materials as possible, for a bargain price!</li>
<li>For a <strong>$10,000</strong> contribution (and more than doubling my fundraising goal, not only will I <strong>Rewonder your entire wedding</strong> as above, but I'll also be your <strong>wedding planner, day-of coordinator, and deejay</strong>.  I'll work with you online via email and instant messagers, and over the phone, then travel anywhere in the 48 contiguous United States one week before your wedding for fittings, helping with last minute details, and setting up decorations. This is restricted to ONE person, with a wedding party of no more than 10 people, a guest list of no more than 200, and a wedding date in 2013 (except August) or later.  Same rules about photos and promotion apply.  Since I'll be there, I'll be taking some of my own photos as well, and will share them with you.  The additional funds over my goal will pay for my travel and lodging for your wedding, allow me to move everything now in storage to New Hampshire, purchase additional items to rewonder and more supplies, and do more advertising.</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Redistribute – How else can you help?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">One great way to help is to spread the word about my campaign to everyone you know through Facebook, Twitter, email, or however else you want to communicate.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Another is to contribute your unwanted jewelry, craft and sewing supplies, fabric, trims and embellishments, clothing, wedding and prom dresses, costume pieces, curtains, blankets, home decorations, and any other items you think might be useful to me. I don't care if it's broken, ripped, or out of style! Do you have a 10x10 canopy you're not using? Something that will make a good display piece? Adjustable dress forms, portable washing machine, sewing machine, or serger? Things I could use to make the perks I've mentioned? If you live within a 2-3 hours drive of Hillsborough, NH or along the route between there and Columbus, OH, I can arrange to pick things up. Otherwise, talk to me about arrangements for shipping.</p>

Rewondered – What is Rewondered?
Rewondered is a one-woman handmade fashion business specializing in items for anyone who wants to express their style in a distinctive and unconventional fashion.
When I decided to start my own business, I wanted it to express my creativity, as well as do some small part to save the world (I'm not a superhero in real life, but I play one online).

For a $20 contribution, you can choose a necklace or a bracelet, custom made for you with up to 20 charms or beaded sections, or a Rewondered upcycled bag.
For a $25 contribution, I will send you an autographed 8x10 from my photo shoot last December (see the gallery for options), and a 2-minute recording of me reading from one of the erotica stories by Teresa Noelle Roberts.
For a $50 contribution, you can choose between a custom made Rewondered skirt or floor-length tutu, or a 75-piece photo booth prop package, consisting of new, repurposed and handmade items.
For a $100 contribution, you can choose either two bouquets or two centerpieces (or one of each), custom made from a variety of materials such as fabric, paper, brooches, beads, wire, or whatever else your imagination can think up.  I'll work with you to make something truly ""you""-nique.
For a $500 contribution, you will be one of the first to get a customized Rewondered Wedding Dress (or other formal attire) or a customized Cosplay Outfit or costume of your choice.
For a $4995 contribution (and thus funding all 5 phases) I will Rewonder your entire wedding. This includes ensembles for the wedding party, such as dresses, jackets, vests, veils or fascinators, headbands or other hair accessories, jabots or neckties, and jewelry. It also includes bouquets, boutonnieres, centerpieces and other decorations, wedding favors, invitations, and programs. I am restricting this to ONE person, with a wedding party of no more than ten people (any combination of brides, grooms, attendants, parents, officiants, etc. In other words, your choice of up to ten people total), a guest list of no more than 200, and a wedding date of no earlier than October 2012 (so I actually have time to work with it in addition to my own wedding in August). You also must agree to provide pictures of your wedding and allow me to use them for promotional purposes (so be sure to discuss that with your photographer, or get some really good candids).  I will also be posting on my blog about my progress on what I'm making for your wedding.  Here is your chance for a handmade wedding, using as many repurposed materials as possible, for a bargain price!
For a $10,000 contribution (and more than doubling my fundraising goal, not only will I Rewonder your entire wedding as above, but I'll also be your wedding planner, day-of coordinator, and deejay.  I'll work with you online via email and instant messagers, and over the phone, then travel anywhere in the 48 contiguous United States one week before your wedding for fittings, helping with last minute details, and setting up decorations. This is restricted to ONE person, with a wedding party of no more than 10 people, a guest list of no more than 200, and a wedding date in 2013 (except August) or later.  Same rules about photos and promotion apply.  Since I'll be there, I'll be taking some of my own photos as well, and will share them with you.  The additional funds over my goal will pay for my travel and lodging for your wedding, allow me to move everything now in storage to New Hampshire, purchase additional items to rewonder and more supplies, and do more advertising.
Redistribute – How else can you help?
One great way to help is to spread the word about my campaign to everyone you know through Facebook, Twitter, email, or however else you want to communicate.
Another is to contribute your unwanted jewelry, craft and sewing supplies, fabric, trims and embellishments, clothing, wedding and prom dresses, costume pieces, curtains, blankets, home decorations, and any other items you think might be useful to me. I don't care if it's broken, ripped, or out of style! Do you have a 10x10 canopy you're not using? Something that will make a good display piece? Adjustable dress forms, portable washing machine, sewing machine, or serger? Things I could use to make the perks I've mentioned? If you live within a 2-3 hours drive of Hillsborough, NH or along the route between there and Columbus, OH, I can arrange to pick things up. Otherwise, talk to me about arrangements for shipping.
You can also check out the products I currently have for sale in my Etsy shop and online store. Feel free to pin the stuff you like on Pinterest or share it on Facebook or Twitter! Also check out my website, like my Facebook page, follow me on Twitter and Pinterest, and subscribe to my blog.
And don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!
Thank you for taking a look at my campaign, and thank you for your contribution (monetary or otherwise).  I very much appreciate it!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sawasdee ka. My name is Nut. I am the founder and designer of PHIORY. From the brand's motto; versatile beauty, my dream is to make leather handbags that are not only beautiful but are functional as well. Q is my latest model that is created with the L-Hub or Lifestyle Hub concept in mind. It is to design a bag that serves women with urban lifestyle well.</p>
<p>It took almost 7 months in developing this from just an idea to the perfect bag. Many samples were made in order to find a proper technique, design and material. Most importantly, after the production of each sample, I have used them in my daily life to find what needed to be improved and also to test how sturdy each bag was.</p>
<p>Now is the time to introduce my handbag to the world and I would love to have your support to make this comes true.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have selected high quality leather and accessories in the making of Q. The cost of making this bag is considerably high and since I am the sole entrepreneur, I do not have a lot of capital to produce this bag commercially. If you love my bag and would love to support me, pre-ordering the bag will give me a chance to put this bag into a full production line and to be able to produce a good quality leather bag that is totally worth your spending.</p>
<p>Besides a special 15% off the original retail price from pre-ordering Q, you will also be part of the charitable campaign that I am currently participating in. For each bag, I will be deducting another 15%, taken from my profit, from the pre-ordering price and donate this sum to build an accident and emergency building for Maharaj Nakhonrajsima Hospital in Thailand on your behalf. Not only you will get a great beautiful handbag to use at a special price, you will be able to help those in need at the same time. Isn't it wonderful? :D</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The shading of the leather might be slightly different for each batch of production.</p>
<p>The risk of this project would be to receive your goods a little behind schedule, however I will try to prepare an early stage production while this campaign is running, so I hope to get the products shipped to you within the planned schedule, which is by the early of August.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>We set out to challenge the established pricing model of today, where traditional luxury brands markup their prices up to 800%. Their business model includes distributors, agents, up-street retail locations and excessive marketing. As all these middlemen need their margin, the apparel ends up overpriced and silly expensive.</p>
<p>We decided to change that. </p>

</div>","No harsh chemicals or nanotechnology, those were our guidelines. We wanted to make a line of beautiful knitwear with outstanding natural performance. The Intelligent Everyday Sweater keeps the you cool as your body temperature rises, while the hollow fiber structures provide light-weight insulation when the temperature drops. 





 





Sweaty after that intense commute to work? Anyone? We’re from Stockholm, Sweden - a place where the weather and temperature always are topics of discussion. Cold winters and warm summers. Blasting office AC:s and bursting elements.   For the last year we have been working to create an everyday garment that can keep us comfortable in these changing conditions.  





To make this vision a reality we knew that we had to team up with the best knitwear manufacturer out there. In the small town of Reggio Emilia, outside Parma we found Mauro and his team of skilled artisans. 





 





The Intelligent Sweaters are lightweight and knitted in 12 gauge. This makes them a great mid layer alternative. Throw it under a coat or your favourite blazer for a refined look. 





 










 










 










 





We set out to challenge the established pricing model of today, where traditional luxury brands markup their prices up to 800%. Their business model includes distributors, agents, up-street retail locations and excessive marketing. As all these middlemen need their margin, the apparel ends up overpriced and silly expensive.
We decided to change that. 





We believe that the this traditional model has to be updated and improved. By teaming up directly with our manufacturers, cutting out the middlemen and selling our products directly to you, we can now offer this luxury line of knitwear at factory direct prices.





 










 





 






 





 





 





 





 





 





In May earlier this year we launched our first Kickstarter campaign. Since then we have been blown away with the response from you guys and we knew that we had to come back. This time we wanted to set the bar even higher!

<p><b>Creating a safe and joyful cycling experience</b> is the reason we created LIVALL smart riding equipment. We want the world to get to know the vast possibilities of cycling, and show that it can be more fun than one can imagine. Also, by drawing more attention to cycling, we want to promote <b>a healthy and low-carbon life style</b>.</p>
<p>In order to put our product
into <b>mass production </b>and to let more people get to know our product, we need
funds. Our target customers are —just like Indiegogo’s users— open to innovation, they care about the quality
of their life and others’,
and value the natural environment. <b>Indiegogo is one of the most influential
crowdfunding platforms,</b> and it already helped to make a lot of dreams come
true. We hope it can help us to achieve our common goal as well.</p>

""Cycling Across the U.S."" 

-Starting from June 3rd
-Ended in Los Angeles on August 7th.
The “Cycling Across U.S.” team is sponsored by
LIVALL and led by Mr. Feibao Jin, who earlier climbed 7 summits and walked from
the South to the North Pole in 19 months. The team departed on June 3rd in
Plymouth and plans to arrive in LA on August 7th.
They have arrived in Santa Monica, the end of Route 66 recently with their LIVALL gear!















Creating a safe and joyful cycling experience is the reason we created LIVALL smart riding equipment. We want the world to get to know the vast possibilities of cycling, and show that it can be more fun than one can imagine. Also, by drawing more attention to cycling, we want to promote a healthy and low-carbon life style.
In order to put our product
into mass production and to let more people get to know our product, we need
funds. Our target customers are —just like Indiegogo’s users— open to innovation, they care about the quality
of their life and others’,
and value the natural environment. Indiegogo is one of the most influential
crowdfunding platforms, and it already helped to make a lot of dreams come
true. We hope it can help us to achieve our common goal as well.

<p>Outerwear is the last critical barrier separating us from the outside but yet, jackets haven't evolved even with all the technological innovations and discoveries. Rather than looking at traditional methods such as layering or just different levels of heated wires, our team at Flexwarm was determined to create an intelligent line of clothing starting with the jacket with technology that adapts to you.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Our Answer</h3>
<p>Over the last 5-years, our team has been researching a new technology based on thin-film techniques we call Flexwarm. In the last few years, we have made developed patented breakthroughs that have allowed us to embed smart sensors and a completely unique flexible heating layer that is both extremely thin (0.5 mm) and completely safe. Utilizing Flexwarm, we have created the Flexwarm Jacket and Vest that will change everything about wearable technology!</p>

Outerwear is the last critical barrier separating us from the outside but yet, jackets haven't evolved even with all the technological innovations and discoveries. Rather than looking at traditional methods such as layering or just different levels of heated wires, our team at Flexwarm was determined to create an intelligent line of clothing starting with the jacket with technology that adapts to you.




Our Answer
Over the last 5-years, our team has been researching a new technology based on thin-film techniques we call Flexwarm. In the last few years, we have made developed patented breakthroughs that have allowed us to embed smart sensors and a completely unique flexible heating layer that is both extremely thin (0.5 mm) and completely safe. Utilizing Flexwarm, we have created the Flexwarm Jacket and Vest that will change everything about wearable technology!







What People Say About Flexwarm







50% More Battery Life
Compared to traditional Carbon Fiber heating technologies, Flexwarm is 50%+ more energy efficient. This means, the same battery can keep you warm all day max. for 13 hours* with Flexwarm vs. 8 hours with Carbon Fiber technologies.


*battery claims depend on heat level settings and bluetooth connectivities and many other factors; actual results will vary. 


The First Climate Control Jacket
Flexwarm uses 2 integrated sensors to measure the temperature inside the jacket, and the temperature outside the jacket. Just set your perfect temperature from the iOS or Android App, and your jacket will automatically adjust the heating levels to maintain a constant internal temperature. Flexwarm is a smart jacket that adapts to you.



Control Your Jacket Through The App
Flexwarm is the first jacket to be controlled through your iOS or Android smart device. Control the temperature of each individual region accurate to 1 degree. This is just the beginning of the revolution starting with the Jacket. Imagine a future where smart wearable clothing can be controlled from your smart watch!





Use Your Own Battery Pack
Due to the increased efficiency of the Flexwarm technology, we are the only smart jacket to feature comprehensive 4-region panels without a proprietary 12V battery. Flexwarm uses your everyday typical 5V USB battery pack. This means if you lose your battery, your can easily replace the battery with one from a local electronics store.

More Heat Area
Flexwarm patented technology evenly distributes heating areas as compared to traditional carbon fiber heating wires which are thick and sparse. This means no cold spots and less warm up time.





As Seen On



Flexwarm is the next generation in smart wearable technology



How Does Flexwarm Compare?
Flexwarm is a pioneer in intelligent wearable technology that is both smarter and more energy efficient than any of the available products. Be a part of the revolution today!














Keeping Your Hands Warm
Integrated into each sleeve are built-in gloves to keep hands warm both indoor and outdoor. The perfect solution for your freezing office!







Sensors Detect the Perfect Temperature


 What really sets Flexwarm apart from just another heated jacket is the climate control feature. Heating elements automatically adapt depending on the exterior and interior temperature so your personal temperature remain perfect, no matter the weather.






Fully adjustable temperature across 4 controllable regions including front chest, back, and hands.




Set your ideal temperature with just a push of a button or through an app with distributed heat up to 149F. 





(Our lab test standard is IEC 60335-2-17)




Setting up is Easy

We believe when parents are faced with the choice between the EZ-On BaBeez ""onesie"" and the traditional ""onesie"", they will always choose our ""onesie"" because of the additional features and benefits.</p><p>However, the reality is, there are always risks with every new business or venture.  Besides the function and utility of the EZ-On BaBeez ""onesies"", people are attracted to their aesthetics, styling, fabrics, and prints that make their babies more comfortable and stylish. It's all about making babies comfortable and making parents feel good about what their babies are wearing. It's a more comfortable and stylish ""onesie"" with greater convenience.</p><p>We are also faced with the challenge of getting into retail stores who will carry our products and successfully increase awareness of our “onesie’s” features and benefits over the traditional ""onesie"". <br/>Finally, we face the challenge competing on cost with traditional ""onesie"" brands and retailers who purchase very large quantities of comparable quality “onesies” at a significantly lower cost. As we are able to order larger quantities we will be competitively priced while providing a better product overall.</p><p>That being said, we have all worked on the launch of new concepts in retail apparel and the creation of successful new retail brands, giving us the experience necessary to succeed in this endeavor.</p><p>With the uniqueness of our “onesie” and its benefits, we believe we can successfully develop products parents will love for their children, and formulate strategies to produce them at a price everyone can afford.</p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>You can make a difference in the world.

These and more will soon be available in many baby boutique stores and online stores.Our EZ-On BaBeez ""onesies"" are made of the softest and most comfortable fabrics.  Our fabrics are made of super fine, soft and stretchy jersey knit material.  They are comprised of 95% Cotton, 5 % Spandex or in 100% Cotton 1x1 rib knit.  All our ""Onesies' are constructed with our unique features, using a soft, scratch-free velcro at the front opening, and a wet resistant liner. Available in sizes: Newborn, O-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-9 months, 9-12 months, and 12-18 months. Machine Washable.  Made in USA or Imported.     
The ImpactThe EZ-On BaBeez ""onesie"" will change the lives of many people and babies around the world. We plan to continue to increase our contributions to children's causes as our assortment of children's products and sales continue to grow.You can feel proud that you are a part of making this world a happier, better place.Your support is the catalyst that will help us transform our mission and vision into a reality.Again, a portion of our profit will go to Children’s causes everywhere including children's hospitals and research.Risks & ChallengesOur innovative redesign of the ""onesie"" has an excellent chance of success in the baby apparel market. We believe when parents are faced with the choice between the EZ-On BaBeez ""onesie"" and the traditional ""onesie"", they will always choose our ""onesie"" because of the additional features and benefits.However, the reality is, there are always risks with every new business or venture.  Besides the function and utility of the EZ-On BaBeez ""onesies"", people are attracted to their aesthetics, styling, fabrics, and prints that make their babies more comfortable and stylish. It's all about making babies comfortable and making parents feel good about what their babies are wearing. It's a more comfortable and stylish ""onesie"" with greater convenience.We are also faced with the challenge of getting into retail stores who will carry our products and successfully increase awareness of our “onesie’s” features and benefits over the traditional ""onesie"". Finally, we face the challenge competing on cost with traditional ""onesie"" brands and retailers who purchase very large quantities of comparable quality “onesies” at a significantly lower cost. As we are able to order larger quantities we will be competitively priced while providing a better product overall.That being said, we have all worked on the launch of new concepts in retail apparel and the creation of successful new retail brands, giving us the experience necessary to succeed in this endeavor.With the uniqueness of our “onesie” and its benefits, we believe we can successfully develop products parents will love for their children, and formulate strategies to produce them at a price everyone can afford.Other Ways You Can HelpYou can make a difference in the world. Today, we all strive to make a difference, even when we are unable to do so financially. Please share our campaign with your friends and family and on social media to educate and bring awareness of our baby apparel solutions. Moms, dads, grandparents and baby caregivers will breathe a sigh of relief when they can change diapers faster and more easily. Your efforts will be greatly appreciated by us, our customers, and those who strive to cure children's diseases and illnesses worldwide.Let's leave the world better than we found it… Thank you for your support!",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<b>Champagne Solera</b> - Rated 95
 <br/>
<br/>Solera is made blending all vintages between 1982 and 2011 in oak
barrel with young wines ageing with older wine. Only 0,03% of the Champagne 
production is made under this very unique technique, which provides full flavor and 
complexity to this wine.

 <br/>
<br/>Châteauneuf-du-Pape 2011: This cuvée comes from old vines cultivated under

style, and also lower alcohol level than the other typical Châteauneuf.

the St Emilion plateau, where it is surrounded by Grand Cru Classés.

Funding part of our winemakers’ costs and our unique packaging requires a significant investment for future productions.
We already have the date secured for our first 12 wine barrels and the first bottles are ready to be sent.
<br/>
<br/><b>With every 10k USD donated, we can secure enough bottles with a single winemaker</b> to get listed by distributors
and retailers in a given state.
If we get enough support, we will launch in at least three states and establish a collection between 8 to 25 wines.
<br/>
<br/>We need ambassadors who appreciate what we are doing and could <b>relay our story to their friends</b>
and close networks.

Selected Wines









Champagne Solera - Rated 95
 
Solera is made blending all vintages between 1982 and 2011 in oak
barrel with young wines ageing with older wine. Only 0,03% of the Champagne 
production is made under this very unique technique, which provides full flavor and 
complexity to this wine.
 More...







Châteauneuf-du-Pape 2011 - Rated 94
 
Châteauneuf-du-Pape 2011: This cuvée comes from old vines cultivated under 
biodynamic technique. The organic growing grants this wine a fresher and more complex 
style, and also lower alcohol level than the other typical Châteauneuf.
 More...







Saint Emilion Grand Cru 2012 - Rated 92
 
This cuvée is made 100% of Merlot, which is unusual
and provides more roundness and freshness to the wine. It comes from a single parcel on 
the St Emilion plateau, where it is surrounded by Grand Cru Classés.
 More...







Chassagne Montrachet 1er Cru Morgeot 2011 - Rated 92
 
Probably the most powerful
Chardonnay from Burgundy together with The Montrachet Grand Cru. Concentrated, 
round, voluptuous, words are missing to describe the opulence of this cuvée.

We are a Franco-American team stationed in Paris, Chicago, NYC, and San Francisco
who share a passion for good wine and have a strong and legitimate track record with respect to both wine and entrepreneurship.


Our ambition is to share the finest wines from the most revered terroirs in France, not yet widely explored in the United States.






Funding part of our winemakers’ costs and our unique packaging requires a significant investment for future productions.
We already have the date secured for our first 12 wine barrels and the first bottles are ready to be sent.

With every 10k USD donated, we can secure enough bottles with a single winemaker to get listed by distributors
and retailers in a given state.
If we get enough support, we will launch in at least three states and establish a collection between 8 to 25 wines.

We need ambassadors who appreciate what we are doing and could relay our story to their friends
and close networks.







You will play a crucial role in shaping the wines we choose.
We have built a unique system to make tasting notes approachable to all.
With your feedback forms, we can create a palate profile unique to you and choose our future collection
based on your tastes.

We will grant you access to our Blason club, where we will provide you with articles,
wine courses, quizzes, games for you to learn about the wine universe and embark on a discovery journey
through French terroirs and their unique stories.

<h1><b>What kind of wood is the watch made from ? </b></h1>
<p><b>Sandalwood</b> is the name of a class of fragrant woods from trees in the genus <i>Santalum</i>.
 The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and unlike many other 
aromatic woods they retain their fragrance for decades. As well as using
 the harvested and cut wood, essential oils are also extracted from the 
woods for use. </p>
<p>This is not just any kind of wood, in the East, it's considered to be an attractive, and special kind of wood. </p>
<p>Sandalwood comes from the Sandal Tree, known scientifically as Santalaceae 
          Santalum Album and in Sanskrit as chandana. In English it is called 
          White Sandalwood or Yellow Sandalwood depending on the age of the 
          tree. An evergreen tree that grows only in the southern areas of India, 
          Indonesia and somewhat in Australia.</p>
<p>The hard, yellow, outer wood is mostly used for carving statues and 
          decorative articles such as combs, beads and boxes.</p>

</div>","Perfect Fitting Chinos, Performance Fabric.

We always make trade-offs when we buy chinos. Maybe we love the fabric, but hate the fit. Or we love the fit, but hate the design. 
Well, at Woodies we don't like compromises. 
We promise a perfect fit, and our new performance fabric will have you looking sharp, staying cool and looking fresh. 
*Now available in Women's sizing as well!
Meet The Ultimate Performance Chinos.





 







Stain Repellent: We use patented technology in 
our fabric so that your chinos 
repel some of the toughest 
stains. Spilt coffee? No problem.

Smart Stretch: Our chinos are woven with 5% stretch, ensuring that your 
chinos are flexible and keep up 
with your busy life.

Quick Dry: Are you an active commuter? Are you going to work after some morning reps? These chinos keep you cool and dry.

Easy Care: Our unique blend of natural 
and synthetic fibers holds 
up well throughout 
your busy day.   






Subtle Details Matter Most
These chinos are built to last. We've reinforced the crotch seam, bar tacked points of stress, and used premium hardware, like YKK zippers. 
We obsess over the small details, and you'll love them. 
  





 





 
No Small, Medium or Large, Just You. 
We use advanced sizing algorithms to calculate measurements based off as little as your height, weight and average shirt size (no tape measure required!). 
We've made clothes for guys that are 4 ft to 7 ft, from 100 lbs to 400 lbs and everything in between. 





Like to keep it old school? Grab a tape measure and watch our easy to follow instructional videos. 





We guarantee the fit of your clothing. If something is off, we'll send you a complimentary remake. Read more about our guarantee here.  





Custom made, to your taste.
Flat front or pleats? Plain pockets or flap? Cuff or regular hem? Totally up to you! You have the ability to customize your own performance chinos. 





 In addition to styling, choose your desired fit, extra slim, slim or regular. 





Lastly, you'll be able to choose whether or not you'd like a crease.

<h3>Company and Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>Combat Flip Flops is a veteran-owned company founded by two Army Rangers and a civilian construction worker.  We make products in war zones or post war zones.  With the profits, we fund education for Afghan women.  You may have seen us in the news or on Shark Tank, but simply put--we make meaningful change in difficult areas.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlP8Zig_ksM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>This shoe was set to launch in October 2017, but the event and our ability to help accelerated the release and triggered this Indiegogo Campaign.  This is going to be gritty and raw.  If you want to fund a campaign with pretty videos, this isn't it.  If you want a cool product and ensure every penny helps those in need, here you go.</p>
<p>Our fellow Americans are hurting and we can help.  Based on our experience, the help tends to reduce greatly when the water recedes.  That's when the real work begins.  Victims will return to their homes and begin the long, slow process of putting their lives back together.  Long days with heavy labor.  Food and a clean place to sleep is the least we could do to help.  Profits will be used to fund meals, mattresses, pillows, and clean sheets.  </p>
<p>With your donation, you'll get a rad pair of shoes and $11.50* will be donated to relief efforts.  The scale and magnitude is simply dependent upon how much you're willing to participate.</p>
<p>*Donation based on current pricing.  Donation amount will be updated and posted with full transparancy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>$20,000 - This funds tooling, materials, and labor at the minimum volume required to start footwear production in Bogota Colombia.   We'll fill in the details as this campaign gets going.  We're a footwear company. Been doing this for years.  This is what it costs.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>You get a cool slip-on shoe.  This shoe is so fresh we haven't even named it yet.  </p>
<p>Rubber outsole with a canvas upper in our favorite colors: Red, White, and Blue.  Men's sizes 7-15 and Women's sizes 5-11.  </p>
<p>It's a shoe.  It's Red, White, and Blue.  And 100% of the profits are donated to help Hurricane Harvey Victims.  </p>
<h3>If We Don't Reach Our Goal</h3>
<p>Never underestimate the power of patriotism.  We're doing this.  If by some random act of God this doesn't go through, 100% will go to the same charities and we'll likely lose faith in humanity.  Let's not go there.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We were going to launch these shoes commercially next month, but we know these can be used for the greater good.  Here is what you will make happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>$11.50* from every shoe will be donated to Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts<ul>
<li>Food - People need to eat while they rebuild their lives.</li>
<li>Mattresses, Pillows, and Sheets:  Nobody should have to sleep on a moldy, damaged mattress.  Let's get them a clean, comfortable place to recover after a long day of work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The shoes will be made by a family-owned business in Bogota, Colombia--helping kickstart an economy recovering from decades of conflict.</li>
<li>You'll support a Veteran-owned business in the mission to help fellow Americans in Houston.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Journey</h3>
<p>We're doing this live.  Our president, Andy, left for Bogota on 30 Aug at 9pm.  He'll be doing live streams to show you what you're getting, who's making it, and why it's important to help. Stay tuned.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>How do I Select My Size?</strong>  Please select a Men's or Women's shoe.  We will send out a Google form to campaign backers that will enable sizing to be selected.</p>
<p><strong>Kids Sizes?</strong>  As of 4 September, we have the question in with your manufacturer.  We estimate this will cost another $500 in tooling expenses (per size). <u><i> If you'd want to buy shoes for your children, please comment and we'll do the analysis</i></u>.  This campaign is meant to raise funds for Harvey Victims--it needs to make sense financially so that we're not taking away from those in need.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Did You Invent a Time Machine?  2014 Delivery for Men's Shoes?</strong>  No.  We did not invent a time machine.  We made an obvious miss checking the date and we're working it to get correct.  Men's a Women's shoes deliver in December 2017.  Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a sizing chart? </strong> See sizing chart above.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Wide Sizes? </strong> At this time, we are going with a standard width shoe.  The challenge the cost of cutting new outsole molds for the wide sizes.  If we overfund and the demand for the wide sizes makes sense, we'll do it.  Otherwise, we need to focus on moving the product that makes the most sense for the purpose of the campaign--raising funds to help Hurricane Harvey survivors.  </p>

Wide Sizes?  At this time, we are going with a standard width shoe.  The challenge the cost of cutting new outsole molds for the wide sizes.  If we overfund and the demand for the wide sizes makes sense, we'll do it.  Otherwise, we need to focus on moving the product that makes the most sense for the purpose of the campaign--raising funds to help Hurricane Harvey survivors.",1.0,1,"2 Campaigns

Then, when the body temperature rises up, it is starting to get too hot inside our clothes making our body producing sweat (especially when performing a sport) sometimes excessively. While sweating, all the layers begin to absorb that sweat which is not a problem when moving to keep the body at a certain temperature but when we stop, then the real problem comes into play. With all the sweat released, we are starting to feel the cold which makes the remaining of our activity uncomfortable and forces us to start moving again.</p><h2>THE SOLUTION</h2><p>With the ThermoSmart™ jacket, while you are active the jacket will not produce any heat because your body already produces it. But as soon as you stop, the system starts heating you up to keep you WARM and DRY.</p><p>Plus, the thermal sensors inside the jacket are making sure each part of your upper body is staying warm, then as soon as a thermal sensor reads a temperature inferior to the one you set, this specific part in the jacket will heat up automatically.</p><p>Imagine having a thermostat, like in your house, in your jacket and each heating element is an independent room.

 Our quality testing standards are ISO 2859-1 (ANSI/ASQC Z1.4-2003), and we thoroughly inspect all components 100% before proceeding to assembly in our very own factory in Pforzheim. Movements are subject to accuracy testing machine with allowable tolerance (+/-0.1ms), and Dials are assembled under an electronic alignment machine. We strive to produce as much as possible ourselves even if it costs us more or takes longer.
 


 

 

 Every purchase of the Ultramatic or Tornado, or purchase of any two or more (2+ pcs) watches ships with this premium collector's box made of wood, a carrying bag and warranty card.

All purchases of one (1pc) The Capital come in a premium slim box and a warranty card.

We guarantee the quality of our products to be 100% free of defects. If something is defective within two years of your purchase, we will replace your watch free of charge.
