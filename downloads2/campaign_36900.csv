<p>Alla metà del secolo scorso una felice intuizione del Duca Luigi Silvestro Camerini e in seguito della Duchessa Adria Scaglia diede il via ad una nuova dimensione botanica nella leggendaria baia di San Montano: la vegetazione spontanea dove si allineava fra le altre  la famosa<i> Ipomoea imperati </i>(pianta estinta in natura e qui ritrovata dall'Orto botanico di Napoli)<i> </i> fu con grande maestria integrata con specie provenienti da altre regioni del pianeta (dalle <i>cycadales </i>di provenienza tropicale alle <i>Genista tyrrhena</i>** di origini mediterranee). In seguito ad uno studio sul DNA si è potuto accertare che il ceppo di provenienza di questa Genista è quello endemizzato in origine sull'isola di Ponza. <br/>Questo nuovo profilo botanico fu arricchito nel tempo e divenne parte integrante di una nuova dimensione della baia: Il Parco termale Negombo, oggi inserito nel circuito dei Grandi Giardini Italiani, e costantemente seguito ed arricchito dal paesaggista Ermanno Casasco.</p>

<p>Dopo più di 50 anni con un patrimonio vegetale, in buono equilibrio con le particolari condizioni pedo-climatiche della baia, il luogo è divenuto meta irrinunciabile di un turismo sempre più sensibile a valori botanici e paesaggistici.

<p>Le emozioni, i ricordi di un momento particolare, possono essere rivissuti dando continuità alla componente botanica attraverso i semi raccolti dalle piante del parco stesso. Infatti mettere a dimora questi semi, seguirne lo sviluppo e ricreare una flora delle “piante del Negombo” rinsalderebbe il legame che si stabilisce tra il luogo e i suoi fruitori.</p>
<p>L’esperienza “piante del Negombo” si può estendere ovviamente in un ideale viaggio di ritorno ai luoghi di origine delle piante tra coloro che pur non avendo ancora avuto la fortuna di conoscere il parco ne adotteranno i semi.

<p>Il progetto prevede di raccogliere con attenzione da persone competenti, durante la giusta stagione, una buona quantità di semi di diversissime specie significative (da quelle più rare a quelle più comuni ma tipiche della nostra macchia vegetativa) e farli confluire in una “Banca Negombiana dei Semi” con etichette, nomi botanici, indicazioni di germinabilità, zona climatica consigliata, informazioni sulla rapidità di crescita, stagionalità, altezze, esposizione.</p>
<p>Saranno privilegiate quelle essenze che già dalla prima stagione danno risultati soddisfacenti. Come anche il metro di giudizio non sarà semplicemente quello della rarità ma si privilegeranno gli accostamenti e la riscoperta di piante comuni,  facili da crescere e troppo sottovalutate nel tempo.</p>
<p>Riteniamo importante ribadire che non si tratta di una semplice distribuzione di semi; quello che proponiamo è una esperienza, una emozione: quella sperimentata al Negombo. Fondamentali sono gli accostamenti e i ""mix"", le miscellanee di colori e forme che, ci piace pensare, si trovano solo da noi.</p>
<p>Da qui il nome del progetto: I semi della felicità. L'idea è nata proprio dalla ""reazione"" del pubblico che quotidianamente ci attraversa, ci visita e sovente esclama: ""ma questa cosa non posso riprodurla da me?""</p>

<p>Ovviamente i semi verranno distribuiti con criterio agli interessati (i nostri sostenitori), dando i giusti consigli affinché si garantisca al meglio la riuscita dell’impresa, come per esempio analizzando la zona climatica di destinazione e dando consigli sul terriccio da adoperare.</p>
<p>Contiamo di iniziare la consegna dei semi già dalla fine della campagna crowdfunding fino a maggio per le fioriture stagionali e infine proseguire nei mesi successivi con le specie annuali, biennali e perenni.</p>
<p>Saremo quindi in controtendenza con la normale procedura del crowdfunding che prevede l'inizio della produzione solo dopo aver raggiunto il traguardo e distribuisce le sue ricompense mesi dopo. </p>

<h1>Seeds of Happiness</h1>
<p>We are offering an unusual collection of seeds from the Negombo Park, Ischia, which will bring new life to your balcony, terrace or garden.  We hope you will support us.</p>
<h2>A brief history</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1203009/files/20150207041520-crowdfunding_12.jpg?1423311320"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;""/>
<p>In 1946, Duke Luigi Silvestro Camerini (and later Duchess Adria Scaglia) had the stimulating idea that an extended botanic dimension could be added to the legendary bay of San Montano.  So the natural vegetation of the bay, including the famous Ipomoea Imperati (a plant  previously considered extinct but discovered there by the Botanical Gardens of Naples) was skillfully integrated with species from other regions , for example, Cycadales from the tropics and the Genista Tyrrhena** whose origin from the nearby Island of Ponza was finally established through a dna test. 
This botanical dimension of the Negombo thermal park, now on the circuit of the Great Italian Gardens (Grandi Giardini Italiani ), has been continued and enhanced in recent years under the supervision of the famous landscape designer, Ermanno Casasco.</p>
<h2>Our goals</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1203015/files/20150207042621-baia_spiaggia-1_a7b4b224__3_.jpg?1423311981"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;""/>
<p>After over 50 years’ stewardship of this botanic heritage growing in natural equilibrium with the pedoclimactic conditions of the bay, the thermal park has become a magnet  for tourists sensitive to the landscape and to the biodiversity of the plants.  These now frequently naturalized in the park make up an essential element of the “cultural” experience of guests on the island of Ischia.</p>
<p>Our hope is that through the seeds collected from the plants in the park, the  emotions and memories of a particular time can be revived and resonate in your gardens. In fact, by giving you the opportunity to plant these seeds yourselves,  we hope you will re-create a personal flora of the “flowers of Negombo” and thereby consolidate the bond between you and us.</p>
<p>The “Seeds of Happiness” experience can also obviously be extended to those who have not yet had the opportunity to know the park, but would like to.  You can travel on an ideal journey to the places  where the seeds have come from.  In both cases your balcony, garden, and terrace will become a corner of Negombo.</p>
<h2>Ipomea del Negombo</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1203017/files/20150207042657-giardini_c3e59a66.jpg?1423312017"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;""/>
<p>Our sensitivity to botanic issues has moreover been reinforced since 2002 by the annual marketplace (Ipomea) of rare and unusual plants  from specialized nurseries all over Italy organized at Negombo. This has helped us raise public awareness of botanical issues, and given us the opportunity to stage scientific events by major Italian universities with the aim of promoting environmental sensibility. This year the dates scheduled for Ipomea are from 22nd. to 24th. May 2015.</p>
<h2>What We Want to Create</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1203022/files/20150207042842-giardini-baia-spiagggia-001_14df2f9e.jpg?1423312122"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;""/>
<p>The “Seeds of Happiness” project will collect a range of seeds of diverse but significant species (from the most rare to the most common which are typical of our vegetation zone) and place them in a Negombo Seed Bank (“Banca Negombiana dei Semi”) duly labelled with their botanic names, indications of sprouting period, recommended climate conditions, and information of the speed of growth, season, height, and exposure to the sun.  </p>
<p>We will first select the species that will immediately give satisfactory results even in the first year. The criteria behind this choice will on some occasions be rarity, on others the rediscovery of undervalued common plants.  What counts particularly is  that the plants go well together.</p>
<p>This project does not aim at being a mere distribution of seeds, but at evoking an experience, and an emotion like the ones you experienced in Negombo.   To achieve this, the combination of seeds is fundamental just as the miscellany of colors and mixture of shapes  at Negombo is unavailable anywhere else.</p>
<p>The idea for this project came to us from the “reactions” of the public who daily go through our gates and exclaim “Could I reproduce an atmosphere like this in my place?”  With this project we hope you will be able to do just that and we hope the seeds will give you happiness. </p>
<h2>Distribution of the Seeds</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1203032/files/20150207043345-piscina-templare-giardini-2008_898f2cf0.jpg?1423312425"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;""/>
<p>Obviously the seeds will be distributed with great care to the people who support this project. Advice will be given on how to obtain the best results, depending on the climate zone and the soil conditions of the destination. </p>
<p>We shall begin delivery of the seeds  at the end of the crowdfunding campaign and will continue for the seasonal blooms until May and for the annuals, biennials and perennials in the following months.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of the usual crowdfunding campaigns where production is started after reaching the set goals and the rewards are distributed many months later. </p>
<p>If the goals are exceeded, additional bonuses will be given for each supporter.</p>
<p>Thank you, and may these seeds bring you pleasure!</p>

Our sensitivity to botanic issues has moreover been reinforced since 2002 by the annual marketplace (Ipomea) of rare and unusual plants  from specialized nurseries all over Italy organized at Negombo. This has helped us raise public awareness of botanical issues, and given us the opportunity to stage scientific events by major Italian universities with the aim of promoting environmental sensibility. This year the dates scheduled for Ipomea are from 22nd. to 24th. May 2015.
What We Want to Create

The “Seeds of Happiness” project will collect a range of seeds of diverse but significant species (from the most rare to the most common which are typical of our vegetation zone) and place them in a Negombo Seed Bank (“Banca Negombiana dei Semi”) duly labelled with their botanic names, indications of sprouting period, recommended climate conditions, and information of the speed of growth, season, height, and exposure to the sun.  
We will first select the species that will immediately give satisfactory results even in the first year. The criteria behind this choice will on some occasions be rarity, on others the rediscovery of undervalued common plants.  What counts particularly is  that the plants go well together.
This project does not aim at being a mere distribution of seeds, but at evoking an experience, and an emotion like the ones you experienced in Negombo.   To achieve this, the combination of seeds is fundamental just as the miscellany of colors and mixture of shapes  at Negombo is unavailable anywhere else.
The idea for this project came to us from the “reactions” of the public who daily go through our gates and exclaim “Could I reproduce an atmosphere like this in my place?”  With this project we hope you will be able to do just that and we hope the seeds will give you happiness. 
Distribution of the Seeds

Obviously the seeds will be distributed with great care to the people who support this project. Advice will be given on how to obtain the best results, depending on the climate zone and the soil conditions of the destination. 
We shall begin delivery of the seeds  at the end of the crowdfunding campaign and will continue for the seasonal blooms until May and for the annuals, biennials and perennials in the following months.
This is the opposite of the usual crowdfunding campaigns where production is started after reaching the set goals and the rewards are distributed many months later. 
If the goals are exceeded, additional bonuses will be given for each supporter.
Thank you, and may these seeds bring you pleasure!

Other ways to help
There are many ways you can contribute to this project: talk to your friends, share this page on the social networks, click “I like this” and share the Negombo Facebook posts. Remember  also to click “I like this” for our videos on YouTube and e-mail this page to your friends by clicking on the button under the title.
One perk
For all our supporters who are on Ischia on 22nd., 23rd. and 24th. May 2015 free admission will be offered to the 13th edition of “Ipomea del Negombo” - the marketplace of rare and unusual plants of the Mediterranean.  Just get your credentials checked at our offices.

How the raised funds will be used
We are setting our goal at 7000€

630€ are for Indiegogo costs and transactions
1000€ are for the “seed gatherers” in the calendar year
700€ for the awareness-promotion campaign and other communication costs
450€ for the production of the fabric bags to hold the seeds
420€ for the cleaning, storage, selection and conservation of the seeds
500€ for postage (free in Italy)
1000€ for office expenses including sending  gardening tips
300€ for the printing of flyers, brochures and posters
600€ for the rewards
1400€ for the creation of a website, blog and facebook page, and for the twitter and youtube accounts that will follow the project through to the early planting and sprouting phase.  This will create a direct link with the supporters and set the ground to make  the “Negombo seed bank” an annual initiative that continues over time.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>To thank your
contributions, we prepared some perks including a full DVD kit with a personal devotement, a Shark Savers Germany bottle opener, movie posters and postcards. Very generous donors will get a full package!</p><b>Why This Is Important<br/></b><p>There are many reasons why protecting sharks is important. As apex
predators, sharks play a key role in maintaining marine ecosystem health. In fact, there
are a number of places where the killing of sharks caused serious problems to the marine environment and human communities. The extinction
of sharks would have very negative consequences for the global food security, livelihood
of millions of fishers, and thereby for the well being of hundreds of millions
of people.

</p><p>Due to
overfishing, many shark species are endangered and so far there is not enough
support to protect them. Shark attacks are extremely rare events, but media
hypes keep the bad reputation of these animals alive. Creating awareness to correct
the false image of sharks and explaining their importance is therefore crucial
for their conservation. </p>
<p>Along my
career, I worked in a couple of shark projects where I had the chance to get to
know their beauty, experience their threats and raise awareness of the public.
In most cases, I could see how the fear and aversion of sharks from people
changed into curiosity and fascination. I am sure that this movie has the
strength to trigger this exact change and helps reducing the threat on these
animals. </p><b>Challenges</b><p>The objective to reduce
threats on sharks including overfishing and fatal shark attack mitigation
programs is a challenge that involves the change in consumers habits, the
creation of alternative incomes for fishers, the improvement of shark
reputation and many other initiatives. In short, it is a very complex task that
needs the effort of many people all over the world. Through the movie we will
contribute to the very important step to raise peoples' awareness. To maximize
the outreach of the project, we translated the movie and the question selection
into English, German, Spanish and Portuguese and plan to add translations into
languages spoken in countries where shark conservation is of special concern.

</p><p>Even though the shark
culling was stopped in Western Australia, there are other countries and other Australian
states where the killing of sharks for alleged public safety is still conducted.
Our work will especially focus on these places. I will be working in Australia
in the next years and plan to distribute the movie in places
where it is mostly needed. </p><b>How Else You Can Help Us<br/></b><p>Besides

Wahrscheinlich gibt es kaum ein Thema, dass mich mehr in den Bann zieht wie die unglaubliche Geschichte der Haie. Seit 5 Jahren arbeite ich bereits als Wissenschaftlicher Vorstand des gemeinnützlichen Vereines Shark Savers Germany und widme meine Freizeit der Verbesserung dieser wunderschönen Tiere.</p><p>Im Laufe eines Jahres und mit Hilfe von vielen helfenden Händen, habe ich den Dokumentarfilm <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh_IoG3gapk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'A golden state for sharks?'</a> produziert. Der Film erzählt die Geschichte eines Programmes in Westaustralien, dass Haie gezielt tötete um Badegäste zu schützen. Doch recht schnell wurde klar, dass derartige Programme nicht nur bedrohte Tierarten tötet, sondern auch keinen Einfluss auf die Sicherheit von Menschen hat. Auf der ganzen Welt kamen Menschen zusammen um für die Rechte von Haien zu protestieren. Also startete ich eine Reise um nach alternativen Strategien zu suchen, die ein friedliches Zusammenleben von Hai und Mensch ermöglichen.</p><p>Deine Unterstützung wird uns dabei helfen den entstandenen Film zu bewerben und zu verbreiten. Unser Ziel ist es das öffentliche Bewusstsein für diese missverstandenen und bedrohten Tiere zu bessern. Denn der schlechte Ruf, den Haie haben, ist eine der größten Hürden um Menschen zu überzeugen aktiv für ihren Schutz zu werden. Schau dir unseren Film an, lerne mehr darüber warum Haie so wichtig für unsere Meere und uns Menschen sind und hilf uns unser Spendenziel zu erreichen!  <br/></p><p><b>Was du davon hast</b></p><p>Unser Film wurde erstmalig im Mai 2015 auf einem Tauchevent in Deutschland ausgestrahlt. Eine Deutsche und eine Englische Version gibt es im Internet. Ich war komplett überrumpelt von dem positiven Feedback und der konstruktiven Diskussion, den der Film ausgelöst hat. Aufgrund vieler Nachfragen der Zuschauer, haben wir in Zusammenarbeit mit Lehrern einen Fragenkatalog erstellt, der sowohl auf privaten Events als auch für den Schulunterricht als Diskussionsgrundlage genutzt werden kann.  <br/></p><p>Den Film selbst haben wir komplett umsonst produziert. Doch nun benötigen wir finanzielle Mittel um DVDs und den Fragenkatalog zu produzieren und den Film zu verbreiten. Wir werden:</p><p>- Den Fragenkatalog drucken lassen</p><p>- DVDs brennen und die Hüllen produzieren (Hüllen werden aus recycletem Material gemacht)<br/></p><p> Hierfür brauchen wir in etwa 1.200 Euro.</p><p>Wir haben ein paar nette Perks vorbereitet, um uns bei dir für deine Spende zu bedanken. Unter anderem gibt es ein komplettes DVD-Set mit persönlicher Widmung, Filmplakate, Shark Savers Germany Flaschenöffner und Postkarten. Sehr großzügige Spender bekommen das komplette Paket!</p><p><b>Warum unser Projekt wichtig ist</b></p><p>Es gibt viele gute Gründe warum Haie schützenswert sind. Als große Jäger spiele Haie eine zentrale Rolle für die Gesundheit der Meere. Tatsächlich hat die Überfischung von Haien bereits in einigen Orten ernste Konsequenzen für die Umwelt inklusive der Menschen gehabt. Das Aussterben der Haie würde schwerwiegende Probleme für die Nahrungssicherstellung, das Einkommen von Millionen Fischern und das Wohlbefinden von hunderten Millionen Menschen mit sich bringen. <br/></p><p>Aufgrund von starker Überfischung sind viele Haiarten vom Aussterben bedroht und bekommen bisher nicht genug Unterstützung um sie zu schützen. Haiattacken sind auf der anderen Seite extrem seltene Vorfälle. Doch Medien halten mit ihren Schlagzeilen den schlechten Ruf der Haie aufrecht. Diesen Ruf richtig zu stellen und die Bedeutung von Haien bewusst zu machen ist daher ein sehr wichtiger Schritt für ihren Schutz.</p><p>Während meiner Karriere habe ich bereits in einigen Haiprojekten gearbeitet und hatte die Gelegenheit mit ihre Schönheit und ihrer Bedrohung kennenzulernen und diese Erfahrungen mit der Öffentlichkeit zu teilen. In den meisten Fällen konnte ich sehen wie die Angst und Abneigung gegen Haie in Neugierde und Faszination umgeschlagen sind. Ich bin mir sicher, dass unser Film die Stärke hat eben diesen Unterschied zu machen.</p><p><b>Unsere Herausforderungen</b></p><p>Das Ziel die Bedrohung der Haie zu verringern ist eine große Herausforderung, die von viele Faktoren abhängt. Die Gewohnheiten von Konsumenten müssen sich ändern, alternative Einnahmequellen für Fischer müssen geschaffen werden, der Ruf der Haie muss verbessert werden, und und und. Kurz gesagt, es ist eine sehr komplexes Aufgabe, die der Arbeit von vielen Initiativen auf der ganzen Welt bedarf. Unsere Dokumentation wird zu einem sehr wichtigen Schritt beitragen: das Bewusstsein der Menschen für dieses Thema zu verbessern. Um möglichst viele Menschen zu erreichen wurde der Film auf Englisch und Deutsch produziert und erhielt Spanische Untertitel. Wir planen außerdem Übersetzungen in Sprachen wo der Haischutz von besonderer Bedeutung ist. <br/></p><p>Obwohl das Haitötungsprogramm in Westaustralien beendet wurde gibt es eine Reihe anderer Staaten, wo derartige Programme immer noch aktiv sind. Unsere Arbeit soll ich besonders auf diese Orte spezialisieren. Ich persönlich werde in den nächsten Jahren in Australien leben und dafür Sorge tragen, dass der Film dorthin gelangt wo es am meisten gebraucht wird.</p><p><b>Wie du uns sonst noch helfen kannst</b></p><p>Neben einer finanziellen Spende, gibt es noch weitere Wege wie du uns helfen kannst.

contributions, we prepared some perks including a full DVD kit with a personal devotement, a Shark Savers Germany bottle opener, movie posters and postcards. Very generous donors will get a full package!Why This Is ImportantThere are many reasons why protecting sharks is important. As apex
predators, sharks play a key role in maintaining marine ecosystem health. In fact, there
are a number of places where the killing of sharks caused serious problems to the marine environment and human communities. The extinction
of sharks would have very negative consequences for the global food security, livelihood
of millions of fishers, and thereby for the well being of hundreds of millions
of people.

Due to
overfishing, many shark species are endangered and so far there is not enough
support to protect them. Shark attacks are extremely rare events, but media
hypes keep the bad reputation of these animals alive. Creating awareness to correct
the false image of sharks and explaining their importance is therefore crucial
for their conservation. 
Along my
career, I worked in a couple of shark projects where I had the chance to get to
know their beauty, experience their threats and raise awareness of the public.
In most cases, I could see how the fear and aversion of sharks from people
changed into curiosity and fascination. I am sure that this movie has the
strength to trigger this exact change and helps reducing the threat on these
animals. ChallengesThe objective to reduce
threats on sharks including overfishing and fatal shark attack mitigation
programs is a challenge that involves the change in consumers habits, the
creation of alternative incomes for fishers, the improvement of shark
reputation and many other initiatives. In short, it is a very complex task that
needs the effort of many people all over the world. Through the movie we will
contribute to the very important step to raise peoples' awareness. To maximize
the outreach of the project, we translated the movie and the question selection
into English, German, Spanish and Portuguese and plan to add translations into
languages spoken in countries where shark conservation is of special concern.

Even though the shark
culling was stopped in Western Australia, there are other countries and other Australian
states where the killing of sharks for alleged public safety is still conducted.
Our work will especially focus on these places. I will be working in Australia
in the next years and plan to distribute the movie in places
where it is mostly needed. How Else You Can Help UsBesides
financial support, there are many other ways to help us achieving our goals.

Your help is highly appreciated!DEUTSCHDas ProjektAls Meeresbiologin versuche ich stets mich den wichtigen Problemen im Bereich des Meeresschutzes zu widmen. Wahrscheinlich gibt es kaum ein Thema, dass mich mehr in den Bann zieht wie die unglaubliche Geschichte der Haie. Seit 5 Jahren arbeite ich bereits als Wissenschaftlicher Vorstand des gemeinnützlichen Vereines Shark Savers Germany und widme meine Freizeit der Verbesserung dieser wunderschönen Tiere.Im Laufe eines Jahres und mit Hilfe von vielen helfenden Händen, habe ich den Dokumentarfilm 'A golden state for sharks?' produziert. Der Film erzählt die Geschichte eines Programmes in Westaustralien, dass Haie gezielt tötete um Badegäste zu schützen. Doch recht schnell wurde klar, dass derartige Programme nicht nur bedrohte Tierarten tötet, sondern auch keinen Einfluss auf die Sicherheit von Menschen hat. Auf der ganzen Welt kamen Menschen zusammen um für die Rechte von Haien zu protestieren. Also startete ich eine Reise um nach alternativen Strategien zu suchen, die ein friedliches Zusammenleben von Hai und Mensch ermöglichen.Deine Unterstützung wird uns dabei helfen den entstandenen Film zu bewerben und zu verbreiten. Unser Ziel ist es das öffentliche Bewusstsein für diese missverstandenen und bedrohten Tiere zu bessern. Denn der schlechte Ruf, den Haie haben, ist eine der größten Hürden um Menschen zu überzeugen aktiv für ihren Schutz zu werden. Schau dir unseren Film an, lerne mehr darüber warum Haie so wichtig für unsere Meere und uns Menschen sind und hilf uns unser Spendenziel zu erreichen!  Was du davon hastUnser Film wurde erstmalig im Mai 2015 auf einem Tauchevent in Deutschland ausgestrahlt. Eine Deutsche und eine Englische Version gibt es im Internet. Ich war komplett überrumpelt von dem positiven Feedback und der konstruktiven Diskussion, den der Film ausgelöst hat. Aufgrund vieler Nachfragen der Zuschauer, haben wir in Zusammenarbeit mit Lehrern einen Fragenkatalog erstellt, der sowohl auf privaten Events als auch für den Schulunterricht als Diskussionsgrundlage genutzt werden kann.  Den Film selbst haben wir komplett umsonst produziert. Doch nun benötigen wir finanzielle Mittel um DVDs und den Fragenkatalog zu produzieren und den Film zu verbreiten. Wir werden:- Den Fragenkatalog drucken lassen- DVDs brennen und die Hüllen produzieren (Hüllen werden aus recycletem Material gemacht) Hierfür brauchen wir in etwa 1.200 Euro.Wir haben ein paar nette Perks vorbereitet, um uns bei dir für deine Spende zu bedanken. Unter anderem gibt es ein komplettes DVD-Set mit persönlicher Widmung, Filmplakate, Shark Savers Germany Flaschenöffner und Postkarten. Sehr großzügige Spender bekommen das komplette Paket!Warum unser Projekt wichtig istEs gibt viele gute Gründe warum Haie schützenswert sind. Als große Jäger spiele Haie eine zentrale Rolle für die Gesundheit der Meere. Tatsächlich hat die Überfischung von Haien bereits in einigen Orten ernste Konsequenzen für die Umwelt inklusive der Menschen gehabt. Das Aussterben der Haie würde schwerwiegende Probleme für die Nahrungssicherstellung, das Einkommen von Millionen Fischern und das Wohlbefinden von hunderten Millionen Menschen mit sich bringen. Aufgrund von starker Überfischung sind viele Haiarten vom Aussterben bedroht und bekommen bisher nicht genug Unterstützung um sie zu schützen. Haiattacken sind auf der anderen Seite extrem seltene Vorfälle. Doch Medien halten mit ihren Schlagzeilen den schlechten Ruf der Haie aufrecht. Diesen Ruf richtig zu stellen und die Bedeutung von Haien bewusst zu machen ist daher ein sehr wichtiger Schritt für ihren Schutz.Während meiner Karriere habe ich bereits in einigen Haiprojekten gearbeitet und hatte die Gelegenheit mit ihre Schönheit und ihrer Bedrohung kennenzulernen und diese Erfahrungen mit der Öffentlichkeit zu teilen. In den meisten Fällen konnte ich sehen wie die Angst und Abneigung gegen Haie in Neugierde und Faszination umgeschlagen sind. Ich bin mir sicher, dass unser Film die Stärke hat eben diesen Unterschied zu machen.Unsere HerausforderungenDas Ziel die Bedrohung der Haie zu verringern ist eine große Herausforderung, die von viele Faktoren abhängt. Die Gewohnheiten von Konsumenten müssen sich ändern, alternative Einnahmequellen für Fischer müssen geschaffen werden, der Ruf der Haie muss verbessert werden, und und und. Kurz gesagt, es ist eine sehr komplexes Aufgabe, die der Arbeit von vielen Initiativen auf der ganzen Welt bedarf. Unsere Dokumentation wird zu einem sehr wichtigen Schritt beitragen: das Bewusstsein der Menschen für dieses Thema zu verbessern. Um möglichst viele Menschen zu erreichen wurde der Film auf Englisch und Deutsch produziert und erhielt Spanische Untertitel. Wir planen außerdem Übersetzungen in Sprachen wo der Haischutz von besonderer Bedeutung ist. Obwohl das Haitötungsprogramm in Westaustralien beendet wurde gibt es eine Reihe anderer Staaten, wo derartige Programme immer noch aktiv sind. Unsere Arbeit soll ich besonders auf diese Orte spezialisieren. Ich persönlich werde in den nächsten Jahren in Australien leben und dafür Sorge tragen, dass der Film dorthin gelangt wo es am meisten gebraucht wird.Wie du uns sonst noch helfen kannstNeben einer finanziellen Spende, gibt es noch weitere Wege wie du uns helfen kannst. Hier sind einige Beispiele:- Teile unsere Kampagne mit deinen Freunden und deiner Familie (das Indiegogo tool ist sehr nützlich)- Schau dir unseren Film an und verbreite ihn in Sozialen Medien wie Facebook und Twitter.  Den kompletten Film gibt es hier:A Golden State for Sharks?- Sprich mit deinen Freunden und deiner Familie darüber, was du gelernt hast.- Werde selber als Voluntär bei Shark Savers Germany aktiv. Wir brauchen immer fleißige Helfer, Übersetzer und neue Kontakte. Du kannst dich ganz nach deinen Interessen einbringen.Vielen Dank für dein Interesse.

All we need from you is $200k to cover the down payment on the land purchase because our funding campaign does not begin until after the contract has been signed.</p>
<p>However . . . help this campaign go viral (over $1MM raised), and we will be able to fast track the opening of this park AND will donate half of what we raise to open parks just like it all across the country. In fact, since we will only need $3MM total to completely develop our site (including purchase of land), we will donate 100% of all funds raised above that to help open more parks like this one.

For everybody else, we will be providing  design plans (includes a short video) for a bunch of really cool energy saving, sustainable, low cost projects that you can implement at home. These project ideas include an all new greenhouse design, an all new raised bed design, a fast-track solar soil sterilizer, a non electric attic cooler, and much more.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We will be creating habitat, raising awareness, providing educational and research opportunities  for Monarch Butterfly conservation, honey bees, native bee conservation,  native plants, and pollinators in general.  We will also have an area set up where we will demonstrate numerous different designs for solar ovens, solar heaters, solar dryers, bio-sand water filters, and much more. The park will be totally sustainable, and self supporting, acting as the ""Poster Project"" for radical resourcefulness. All fertilizer, compost, mulch, and energy will be generated on site (although we will also collect leaves, wood chips, etc. from off site too). Our ultimate goal is to take the entire park entirely off grid . . . electric, heating, waste, and water. We will be demonstrating radical water conservation methods utilizing large scale rainwater harvest and retention. In fact we have no plans to dig wells, wanting to demonstrate what can be done without relying on groundwater.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Funding:</p>
<p>We are seeking $200k to place a down payment on the land where L3PO will be built. We will then implement our innovative local sponsor program to pay off the land in five years, and develop the site in one year.  If we raise $1MM we will be able to purchase the land outright, and expedite the development of the site. We will donate 50% of dollar raised (less campaign fees) above $1MM (up to $5MM) to help open pollinator parks like this one all across the country. Once we have raised $3MM for our project (and able to donate $2MM for others like it) we will donate 100% of everything we raise(less campaign fees)!  Read more about this on our web site at <a href=""http://www.l3po.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.l3po.org</a>.  In the event that we were not able to raise enough money to make the down payment on the property ($200k), we will use all funds raised to create extensive pollinator habitat at Roxbury Park{ <a href=""http://www.roxburypark.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.roxburypark.org</a> },  which sits adjacent to the future site of L3PO. Ken Carman, the visonary behind L3PO, is the caretaker/naturalist for Roxbury Park, which is featured this month in South Carolina Wildlife Magazine. The bottom line is that if enough people show even the smallest level of support, this will happen . . . and more parks like it will be built in other locations.  Once the park is fully open, it will be entirely self sustaining by relying on revenue from admission passes, camping fees, and merchandise sales(plants, seeds, gift shop, etc.)</p>
<p>All funds raised above what we will need to develop and open this site($3MM) will be donated to the National Pollinator Garden Network (NPGN) <a href=""http://millionpollinatorgardens.org/partners/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://millionpollinatorgardens.org/partners/</a> provided they agree to distribute the funds as promised in this campaign.</p>
<p>Going Off Grid:</p>
<p>The greatest challenge we will face in going entirely off grid (electric, heat, water, waste) will be approval from local authorities on ordinance compliance. We will start with the easiest, and continue to move in that direction until we have totally succeeded, or until everyone knows that we made every relentless effort we possibly could and could not overcome situations beyond our control. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Your willingness to share our project with friends, family, co-workers, and everyone else in your network is critical to our success. Help us take this campaign global, and we will donate funds to help open parks just like this one . . . maybe even in your community. This includes ""liking"" our page on Facebook (and then ""sharing"" posts), as well as posting on Twitter, Pintrest, and any other social media outlet you are connected to. Remember that on Facebook, a share is worth a thousand likes, and pushes us higher in the interest indicators that Facebook uses to determine how many people see a post.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
<p>Toxic
fumes produced by idling buses, not only accumulate outside the bus but they
also penetrate inside the bus. Levels of Particular Mater (PM) inside a school
bus can be 5-10 times the levels of that outside of the bus. </p><p>The California Air Resources Board (CARB)
found that school bus trips can increase children’s daily exposure to black
carbon, up to 34 percent compared to regular passenger cars. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433753874/uafcwwz5bbdsjxtoogus.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 595.216783216783px; height: 328px;""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">     </span></p><p>School buses can have a usable life of some 20 to 30 years, unfortunately legislation
of emission standards only apply to newly built vehicles. The existing fleet will continue polluting
for decades to come.  Retrofit programs offer the most economical course of action in combating air pollution. </p><p><br/></p><h3 style=""letter-spacing: normal; color: rgb(42, 42, 42);"">Simple Solution</h3>
<p>Eliminating
unnecessary idling is a simple and cost-effective method in reducing children’s exposure
to toxic air pollutants, especially Particulate Matter (PM).  </p><p>Anti-idling
campaigns are helping, but these programs rely heavily on driver education, not
the application of anti-idle devices.</p>
<p>RDS
Technologies’ R&amp;D Department have designed a special, retrofit hydraulic
hybrid system for the Clean-Air Am-Can Project.  This new hybrid system
incorporates <i><b>an autonomous anti-idle system.</b> </i><b> </b>As expected, eliminating 100%
of toxic exhaust pollutants while the bus is stationary. </p>
<p>The combination
of a hybrid system fitted with an anti-idle device has a cumulative effect producing an additional and significant reduction in fuel consumption and toxic
exhaust emissions. </p><p><br/></p>
<h3>The Product</h3>
<p>For the
purchase price of one new electric hybrid bus, we can convert six buses from the
existing fleet, into fully functioning hydraulic hybrid vehicles.   </p>
<p>The <i><b>HRDS</b></i> Am-Can hybrid
system (featuring anti-idle), produces up to a 40% reduction in fuel
consumption, but more importantly it significantly reduces those toxic exhaust

<p>A 100% reduction in toxic emissions occurs, while the bus is stationary at traffic lights and bus stops. The anti-idle system automatically shuts down the engine when stationary.  Depressing the gas-pedal instantly restarts the bus engine.</p>

<p>PS</p>
<p>Below is additional information on air pollution and the effects it has on agriculture.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Effects of Air Pollution</h3>
<p>Its common
knowledge that exhaust emissions from the transport sector contribute
largely to urban air pollution.  In recent times ""air pollution""
has become a global epidemic and responsible for the deaths of millions of
people.  </p>
<p>Air pollution creates acid rain that's particularly damaging
to ecosystems which includes, soil, lakes, streams, forests, plants and
animals.  Acid rain is also a serious threat to our drinking water held in
reservoirs and dams.</p>
<p>Not so
well known is the adverse effect on plants and food production.  Air
pollution filters out sunlight, hindering photosynthesises in plants, which
severely effects a plant's ability to absorb carbon dioxide.  No doubt,
this will have a negative impact on the effectiveness of tree planting
initiatives in combating greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Food Crops
Affected </h3>
<p>Symptoms
of damage to plants resulting from exposure to air pollution range from slow
growth to leaf browning, followed by premature leaf drop resulting in the death
of the plant.  Some of the more susceptible crops to air pollution are
listed below:</p>
<p>Tomato,
watermelon, squash, potato, string beans, snap beans, pinto beans, tobacco,
soybeans, cantaloupe, muskmelon, alfalfa, beets, sunflower, carrots, sweet
corn, gourds, green peas, turnips, grapes, peaches and strawberries. </p>
<p>The wine
industry could also be adversely effected in the near future.  Not only in
crop yield but the very essence of its flavours may become tainted.</p>
<p>Air
pollution, in particular ground level ozone, can effect crop yields of wheat
and rice.  One report from India quoted a 50% reduction in crop
production.  This will have a devastating effect on the region as they are
a major grain producer and may destabilise the nation’s food security.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Bees</h3>
<p>A recent
study conducted by The University of South Hampton found that diesel
exhaust fumes change the profile of flora odour.  They say these profile
changes may effect honeybees foraging efficiency and ultimately could affect the
pollination of plants.  Without pollination, crops will fail and create
another threat to food security.  <b><i>No Bees - No Food - No Us.</i></b></p>
<blockquote style=""text-align: center;""><b>AIR POLLUTION <em>IS </em>THE WORLD'S LARGEST SINGLE
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RISK</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>List of 6 Criteria Pollutants</b></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b><h4>Particulate Matter</h4></b><p>Particulate matter (PM), also known as particle pollution, is a mixture of extremely small particles found in the air, including dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. Two kinds of particulate matter are identified as being harmful to human health: fine particles (PM2.5), which are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller and typically found in smoke or haze; or inhalable coarse particles (PM10), which are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers in diameter and can be found near roadways and dusty industries. Particulate matter is derived from many different sources, including residential combustion activities and vehicle exhaust. Particulate matter is regulated as one of the six “criteria” pollutants under the federal CAA. Exposure to particulate matter has been linked to a variety of health problems, particularly within the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b><h4>Nitrogen Dioxide</h4></b><p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is part of a group of highly reactive gases known as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and is harmful to human health and the environment. Nitrogen dioxide is emitted from many sources when fuel is burned at high temperatures, including industrial, commercial and residential combustion, motor vehicles, and electric utilities. For this reason, individuals who spend time on or near major roadways are at higher risk for short-term exposure. Nitrogen dioxide is regulated as one of the six “criteria” pollutants under the federal CAA and is harmful to human health, particularly the respiratory system.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Carbon Monoxide</h4>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that is regulated under the federal CAA as one of the six “criteria” pollutants. Carbon monoxide is primarily emitted from combustion processes and the majority of emissions come from mobile sources, especially in urban areas. It is considered very dangerous and harmful to human health and the environment because it can reduce the amount of oxygen delivered to the body’s organs, like the heart and the brain. At very high levels, it can lead to death. People with several types of heart disease may be more severely affected by short-term carbon monoxide exposure.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Ozone</h4>
<p>Ozone (O3), or “ground-level ozone”, is one of the six major pollutants identified by scientists as being harmful to both humans and the environment. Ground-level ozone, which is regulated by the federal CAA, is emitted by a chemical reaction between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Major contributors of NOx and VOCs that lead to the creation of ozone include motor vehicle exhaust from cars, trucks, off-road vehicles, agricultural and construction vehicles, industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents. Ground-level ozone can inflame and damage lungs, increase the frequency of asthma attacks, and make the lungs more susceptible to infection.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Sulfur Dioxide</h4>
<p>Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is part of a group of highly reactive gases known as oxides of sulfur (SOx) and is primarily derived from fossil fuel combustion at power plants and other industrial facilities. Other sources of SO2 include industrial processes like extracting metal from ore and the burning of high sulfur fuels. Sulfur dioxide is one of the six “criteria” air pollutants regulated under the federal CAA. Sulfur dioxide is considered to be harmful to human health and has been linked with many adverse health effects, particularly within the respiratory system.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Lead</h4>
<p>Lead (Pb) is a metal that is both naturally occurring and found in manufactured products, and is also one of the six “criteria” pollutants regulated under the federal CAA. Sources of lead include smelters, mining operations, waste incinerators, battery recycling, and the production of lead shot and fishing sinkers. Lead is also released by burning coal, oil, or solid waste. Lead-based paint may also be present in older homes. It is toxic to both humans and animals, with small children being at the highest risk for lead poisoning.</p>

</div></div>","The featured video was created by the  Environmental Defense Fund  (EDF). 
The Clean Air Am-Can campaign is specifically targeting the toxic exhaust emissions that’s produced by North America's iconic yellow school buses. 

The  Am-Can project includes both America and Canada, as both countries utilize the same platform in bus design, hence the project name.

There are half a million school-buses transporting  26 million students in the US (numbers for Canada are unavailable). As revealed in the above video, school children are exposed to unhealthy levels of toxic air pollutants on a daily basis. 
That's 26 Million Reasons to Campaign for Clean Air
Diesel exhaust is known to cause or exacerbate many respiratory diseases including Asthma, which affects 6.3 million American school children. Asthma is the most common long-term childhood disease in America.  








Researchers at Zuyd University in The
    Netherlands, have found that after just 30 minutes of exposure, diesel
    exhaust fumes affects brain activity. The EEG data suggested that the brain
    displayed a stress response, indicative of changed information processing
    in the brain cortex, which continued to increase even after the subjects
    had left the exposure chamber.  Particles depositing in tissue and oxidative stress has
    also been implicated in degenerative brain diseases such as Parkinson's and
    Alzheimer's disease.





Projects Objective
The Am-Can objective
is to initiate a new course of
action in combating toxic air pollutants produced by North Americas school buses.  This new course being the retrofitting of the existing fleet of buses, with an aftermarket ""hydraulic hybrid system"".Over the
last decade there has been
a number of programs designed to combat exhaust emissions, such as the ""clean school bus"" and the on-going anti-idle campaigns. Unfortunately
the mass adoption of these past clean-air initiatives is failing
to be realized. Funding issues are preventing replacement of older buses and retrofitting of buses with emission reducing devices.Unlike other emission reduction methods, our product produces an economic benefit, which pays for itself within a few years with continued significant reduction in operating costs for the life of the bus.  This fact should be incentive enough, to guarantee a positive outcome for our clean air project.

Identifying the Problem
Toxic
fumes produced by idling buses, not only accumulate outside the bus but they
also penetrate inside the bus. Levels of Particular Mater (PM) inside a school
bus can be 5-10 times the levels of that outside of the bus. The California Air Resources Board (CARB)
found that school bus trips can increase children’s daily exposure to black
carbon, up to 34 percent compared to regular passenger cars.      School buses can have a usable life of some 20 to 30 years, unfortunately legislation
of emission standards only apply to newly built vehicles. The existing fleet will continue polluting
for decades to come.  Retrofit programs offer the most economical course of action in combating air pollution. Simple Solution
Eliminating
unnecessary idling is a simple and cost-effective method in reducing children’s exposure
to toxic air pollutants, especially Particulate Matter (PM).  Anti-idling
campaigns are helping, but these programs rely heavily on driver education, not
the application of anti-idle devices.
RDS
Technologies’ R&D Department have designed a special, retrofit hydraulic
hybrid system for the Clean-Air Am-Can Project.  This new hybrid system
incorporates an autonomous anti-idle system.  As expected, eliminating 100%
of toxic exhaust pollutants while the bus is stationary. 
The combination
of a hybrid system fitted with an anti-idle device has a cumulative effect producing an additional and significant reduction in fuel consumption and toxic
exhaust emissions. 
The Product
For the
purchase price of one new electric hybrid bus, we can convert six buses from the
existing fleet, into fully functioning hydraulic hybrid vehicles.   
The HRDS Am-Can hybrid
system (featuring anti-idle), produces up to a 40% reduction in fuel
consumption, but more importantly it significantly reduces those toxic exhaust
emissions.
A 100% reduction in toxic emissions occurs, while the bus is stationary at traffic lights and bus stops. The anti-idle system automatically shuts down the engine when stationary.  Depressing the gas-pedal instantly restarts the bus engine.
Pictured below is the HRDS hydraulic hybrid system.  See the video at the bottom of this page for explanation and technical details.  No batteries required.   1.  Hydraulic pump/motor:  2. Gearbox: 
3. accumulators.
Alternative Fuels  

The adoption of alternative fuels significantly reduces particular matter and other criteria pollutants. The combustion of alternative fuels still creates toxic emissions, but at a reduced level when compared to diesel buses. This includes, CNG, LPG, bio-fuels and ethanol based fuels. The Hydraulic Regenerative Drive System (HRDS) can
be fitted to any vehicle regardless of fuel type. The conversion significantly reduces fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, resulting in an economic benefit of up to a 40% reduction in fuel costs. The fitment of the HRDS hybrid system to alternative fueled vehicles, produces the cleanest and greenest outcome. 
New Vehicles
The HRDS hydraulic hybrid system can also be fitted to new vehicles. An electric-hybrid system carries a 100% premium on a new school buses purchase price. The HRDS hybrid system is a more affordable 30% premium. To complement our retrofit hybrid projects we plan to produce a complete turnkey hydraulic hybrid bus, in both a diesel/hybrid and a CNG/hybrid configuration. This is achieved by purchasing a suitable vehicle from one of the 6 recognized bus manufacturers, which is then converted and sold on as a new vehicle. The end product produces the most affordable hybrid bus on the market.The Project With more than 35,000 school buses in service,Texan authorities face a daunting task in cleaning up the tailpipe emissions of their school buses. The Am-Can project  presents an alternative or additional option, which supports clean bus programs.Austin Texas is our base of operation for the North American clean air project. Localized vehicle service centers will be enlisted to install and service the HRDS hybrid systems for the project buses. A small fleet of buses will be purchased and converted into fully functioning hybrid vehicles. On completion of shake down trials, the converted buses will be made available to transport operators for evaluation, at no cost. The Am-Can Project is designed to help promote and fast-track the adoption of hybrid school buses in North America. The outcome of this pilot project is to be used to develop a compelling case, in favor of vehicle hybridization and support the commercialization of the Am-Can project.
What We Need  
Without
adequate funding the “Clean Air Am-Can” project will not proceed, which is why
we are seeking contributions. The budget to launch this project is 2
million dollars (USD). Targeted budget will be spent on;
·  Purchasing or
hiring suitable buses
·  Installation of
hybrid conversions
·  Monitoring fuel
consumption and exhaust emissions of these buses
·  Maintenance and
servicing of the hybrid buses
·  Purchase fuel, oil,
tyres etc.
·  Staff wages, travel
expenses and associated administrative costs.
If we
fail to reach our funding target, any monies raised will be used to advance the
project in other ways.  This may be achieved using a scaled down hybrid
project.       If this option is not possible, monies will be utilized to raise
additional capital, using more traditional capital raising methods.
The
scale of our project is only limited by the amount of available funds.In the
event of receiving surplus funds, these will be used to expand the Clean Air
projects.  Resulting in a larger number of cities and states participating in the
project.  With additional funds the scope of the project may even spill
over to neighbouring countries in Latin America.
What You Get
The obvious and most important environmental and health  benefit is cleaner air. Contributors
to this project are an integral part of the Clean Air Am-Can campaign. You will
be credited with being a key player, in combating air pollution and improving
the well-being of those affected by air pollution. 
The
potential market for our product is enormous.  Once the pilot project is
completed the commercialization of the project will begin.  As expected
this will require additional capital, to ramp up production. 
The
best option in raising capital, is to float the company.  As a reward,
crowd funding contributors will be treated as a preferred client, in the
Initial Public Offering (IPO) of company shares.
Risks & Challenges
Risks for the project are negligible. As we are proposing a pilot-project not a commercial venture, there is no
financial risk.  The hybrid system has proven improved fuel economy of up to
40% for urban commercial vehicles and as a result the project will also produce
a significant reduction in toxic exhaust emissions.  
The
outcome of the project will be used in supporting feasibility studies to
promote and fast track the adoption of hybrid vehicles.
Challenges for the Am-Can Project will be
the logistics, we are based in Australia. The logistic will be addressed by
setting up a base of operation in the US. We will seek out local partners, to
assist with installation and service of the hybrid system. A manufacturing plant for our product may be required in North
America to meet future demand.  The biggest challenge for the pilot
project is capital raising, which is why we are crowd funding.

PS
Below is additional information on air pollution and the effects it has on agriculture.

Effects of Air Pollution
Its common
knowledge that exhaust emissions from the transport sector contribute
largely to urban air pollution.  In recent times ""air pollution""
has become a global epidemic and responsible for the deaths of millions of
people.  
Air pollution creates acid rain that's particularly damaging
to ecosystems which includes, soil, lakes, streams, forests, plants and
animals.  Acid rain is also a serious threat to our drinking water held in
reservoirs and dams.
Not so
well known is the adverse effect on plants and food production.  Air
pollution filters out sunlight, hindering photosynthesises in plants, which
severely effects a plant's ability to absorb carbon dioxide.  No doubt,
this will have a negative impact on the effectiveness of tree planting
initiatives in combating greenhouse gas emissions.

Food Crops
Affected 
Symptoms
of damage to plants resulting from exposure to air pollution range from slow
growth to leaf browning, followed by premature leaf drop resulting in the death
of the plant.  Some of the more susceptible crops to air pollution are
listed below:
Tomato,
watermelon, squash, potato, string beans, snap beans, pinto beans, tobacco,
soybeans, cantaloupe, muskmelon, alfalfa, beets, sunflower, carrots, sweet
corn, gourds, green peas, turnips, grapes, peaches and strawberries. 
The wine
industry could also be adversely effected in the near future.  Not only in
crop yield but the very essence of its flavours may become tainted.
Air
pollution, in particular ground level ozone, can effect crop yields of wheat
and rice.  One report from India quoted a 50% reduction in crop
production.  This will have a devastating effect on the region as they are
a major grain producer and may destabilise the nation’s food security.

Bees
A recent
study conducted by The University of South Hampton found that diesel
exhaust fumes change the profile of flora odour.  They say these profile
changes may effect honeybees foraging efficiency and ultimately could affect the
pollination of plants.  Without pollination, crops will fail and create
another threat to food security.  No Bees - No Food - No Us.
AIR POLLUTION IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST SINGLE
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RISK
List of 6 Criteria Pollutants

Particulate MatterParticulate matter (PM), also known as particle pollution, is a mixture of extremely small particles found in the air, including dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. Two kinds of particulate matter are identified as being harmful to human health: fine particles (PM2.5), which are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller and typically found in smoke or haze; or inhalable coarse particles (PM10), which are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers in diameter and can be found near roadways and dusty industries. Particulate matter is derived from many different sources, including residential combustion activities and vehicle exhaust. Particulate matter is regulated as one of the six “criteria” pollutants under the federal CAA. Exposure to particulate matter has been linked to a variety of health problems, particularly within the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.


Nitrogen DioxideNitrogen dioxide (NO2) is part of a group of highly reactive gases known as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and is harmful to human health and the environment. Nitrogen dioxide is emitted from many sources when fuel is burned at high temperatures, including industrial, commercial and residential combustion, motor vehicles, and electric utilities. For this reason, individuals who spend time on or near major roadways are at higher risk for short-term exposure. Nitrogen dioxide is regulated as one of the six “criteria” pollutants under the federal CAA and is harmful to human health, particularly the respiratory system.


Carbon Monoxide
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that is regulated under the federal CAA as one of the six “criteria” pollutants. Carbon monoxide is primarily emitted from combustion processes and the majority of emissions come from mobile sources, especially in urban areas. It is considered very dangerous and harmful to human health and the environment because it can reduce the amount of oxygen delivered to the body’s organs, like the heart and the brain. At very high levels, it can lead to death. People with several types of heart disease may be more severely affected by short-term carbon monoxide exposure.

Ozone
Ozone (O3), or “ground-level ozone”, is one of the six major pollutants identified by scientists as being harmful to both humans and the environment. Ground-level ozone, which is regulated by the federal CAA, is emitted by a chemical reaction between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Major contributors of NOx and VOCs that lead to the creation of ozone include motor vehicle exhaust from cars, trucks, off-road vehicles, agricultural and construction vehicles, industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents. Ground-level ozone can inflame and damage lungs, increase the frequency of asthma attacks, and make the lungs more susceptible to infection.

Sulfur Dioxide
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is part of a group of highly reactive gases known as oxides of sulfur (SOx) and is primarily derived from fossil fuel combustion at power plants and other industrial facilities. Other sources of SO2 include industrial processes like extracting metal from ore and the burning of high sulfur fuels. Sulfur dioxide is one of the six “criteria” air pollutants regulated under the federal CAA. Sulfur dioxide is considered to be harmful to human health and has been linked with many adverse health effects, particularly within the respiratory system.


Lead
Lead (Pb) is a metal that is both naturally occurring and found in manufactured products, and is also one of the six “criteria” pollutants regulated under the federal CAA. Sources of lead include smelters, mining operations, waste incinerators, battery recycling, and the production of lead shot and fishing sinkers. Lead is also released by burning coal, oil, or solid waste. Lead-based paint may also be present in older homes. It is toxic to both humans and animals, with small children being at the highest risk for lead poisoning.

Let us give you some more details about the project:
A team of engineers, all certified passive house designers, with the support of the Hellenic Passive House Institute, will implement the pilot project Passivistas: thehouseproject concerning the Energy Upgrade of a residence in Athens according to the Passivhaus standard  as a tool of continuous and open Education, and Awareness.

The pilot project is the retrofit  of a typical 125m2 one family house of the 60s, in order to minimize (if not eliminate entirely) the need for conventional heating or air conditioning. The selected property is located in the Municipality of Papagou. It consists of ground floor dwelling area E = 98,5M2 and independent semi-basement area space E = 30,5M2. The building is angular projection, with the north-east and south-east facing the road, while being 1.000 meters from the exit of the Attiki Ring road and 1500 meters from the Metro Station of National Defence. Is a full house with garden, structured in a proper spatial planning and the living space of the ground floor has a living room, kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms.The way of design and step-by-step implementation, and the subsequent monitoring and metering pilot project Passivistas: thehouseproject will promote collaborative processes among executives of HPHI, certified passive building designers, engineers and technicians from all sectors and commercial and technical department of companies manufacturing and marketing passive house components. It will offer to every citizen through open public data all the information required on how to drastically save energy in his house, while improving quality of life and contributing substantially to the fight against global warming.

During the implementation phases of energy upgrading work, the aim of the pilot project is to act as a  education- hub for technicians and engineers of all disciplines working in the field of energy renovation of buildings, the ongoing project will implement the following lines of action:· Technical presentations for engineers from all materials which will be applied to the project.

· Cooperation with the local authorities  and organizing visits and in situ presentation for  citizens on issues in energy upgrading of private property.

After completion of the pilot project Passivistas: thehouseproject the house will  act as media  and collaborative process  hub aimed  to prove in practice the ability to upgrade the energy consumption of  residential buildings in Greece, so they do not need conventional heating or air conditioning, while drastically reducing energy costs and improve the quality of life in them.

Save the world!Here's a little something I wrote for you:That Rob Thomas song always bothered meWe're just sitting here waiting for the world to changeMaybe that's what was happening just before now.WARRIORS! for the people! and the planet!I have an announcement to makeThis is DRASTICNO TIME LEFT to be elasticOur sea life is dyingOur deserts expandingRainforests dwindlinghanging on a tiny branch over the cliffWe are speeding, racing towards a MEGA populationIf we are going to keep the life we lovegiving thanks for trees, seas, delicious whirled peasWe WILL get smaller, we WIll buy smaller, we WILL live smallerwe WILL drive smaller or not at allwe WILL BE SO SMALL that the mark we make hereWILL BE NEXT TO NONE.We must turn this around so thatOur great grandchildrenwill be able to live life as we have, or betternotin the most extreme weather and natural disaster that has hit this planet EVERnotwith the human race headed for extinctionOVER CONSUMPTION CONSUMPTION CONSUMPTIONWhat do I need to do for everyone to pay attention?We already know the most important vote we cast is done everyday by how we spend our money...So do we want to fund NEW DESERTS, OIL SPILLS, AND RAPE?Or do we want to invest in love, creation of community, and abolishing FEAR and HATE?Are you thinking, This girl is crazy?because I am thinking most of us are LAZY!Can not we see our own ability?YOU ARE POWERFUL!MAKE YOUR LIFE MEANINGFUL!And I'm sad to bring it down to this, but I feel like we're used to thistreatmentMust I show my tits or say FUCKfor people to WAKE UP?Maybe if I win a football gameor acquire a lot of fameI'm sorry I don't have a cute baby animal to do a trick for youI'm sorry I don't have a fat juicy oiled up ass for you to gawk atI'm sorry I didn't hit #1 with a psychologically manufactured pop songWhat if, instead, I could start a trend just by lovingI have all my limbs and most of my brains, and I'm still young enoughto do a whole bunch... Let us make this world move in a wiser directionMy heart is poundingbecause I am foundinga business based on loveWe are no longer waiting for the world to changeIt is changing, you're on board. How will you show it?Welcome to the age of aquariuswhere we begin to CARRY USLove,Alyssa***********************************************************************Original Story:Hi, we are the DeRonne Family!  We need a place and the tools to build our Protein/Energy Bar business.  We will give back through personally connecting our community and working towards becoming a B Corp.  Read on to hear the whole story!We have a vision, and we have a lot of determination!  We want to save the world! We want to save the planet from deforestation and we want to save our water from contamination.  It's hard to figure out where to start.  It seems like everyone is confused about finding a solution.  We feel like some of the problems we face today come from mass production of livestock, and the lack of home edible gardening and farming.  Imagine how our lives would change if we all started producing our own food, and taking part in our communities again.  Instead of fighting the old, we're building the new!One way we can start making a huge impact is by incorporating insects into our diets.  Insects!  Entomophagy to be exact.  Entomophagy is the practice of eating insects.  Now, hold on.  80% of the world already eats insects.  As a matter of fact, we all used to eat insects.We have been creating delicious healthy snacks and treats with cricket powder...flavors like Orange Carrot, Ginger Vanilla, and Blueberry Maca! Alyssa has carefully designed each mostly-organic, gluten-free protein bar for exquisite taste and specific health benefits.  For instance, most of the bars contain Himalayan pink sea salt which is said to regulate water content in the body, promote healthy ph balance in cells, maintain blood sugar levels, and reduce the signs of aging.  If you scroll down you can learn about each bar and it's benefits.  
Our livestock industry is destroying our world, and if we replaced cattle and swine with insects for consumption (even just a little bit) then we could start rebuilding our forests, and giving land back to the people and animals we've stolen it from.  We need to do this because we owe it to the planet, animals, and people.
As a bonus, crickets are much healthier and easier to digest than cattle or swine.  They pack a ton of B12, Magnesium, Calcium, Iron, and Potassium, not to mention a higher Protein dose per serving than beef or pork with less fat and calories!  They don't even carry the bacteria that cattle, swine, or poultry can.


Let's work together.  You help us, we help you! These protein bars are made with ingredients like oats, coconut, and dates!
We need to buy a small building/kitchen to continue with the business.  If we have our own space to work in we will be able to produce the cricket bars on a larger scale and meet the growing demands so that more people can enjoy the products.   The building will be used both for production and for the LaViewEye organization.
How we plan to help revolutionize business:
Finally, we want to become a B (Be the change!) Corporation.  It's capitalism with a conscious!  Here are some words from the B Corp website:

Did you know that in 15 days there were over 10 instances of injured marine wildlife on the Eastern Aegean Islands in Greece? This is not an unusual occurrence. Unfortunately, in the summer months these instances become more frequent. With over 25000 touristic vessels and 30 million tourists travelling through the area, the number of collisions with boats increases, and the larger human presence causes a massive shock for the wildlife. 





This poor turtle was found entangled in fishing line and the damage caused resulted in the total loss of her front right flipper.
Currently there is no facility within the Aegean that will care for and rehabilitate marine animals in their natural environment, which would allow a smoother transition back into the wild.  

This campaign aims to raise a start-up fund for a new, in sea, rehabilitation centre situated on the west of Lipsi Island in the Bay of Vroulia. 
The isolated bay and building have been kindly provided to Archipelagos by the Municipality of Lipsi where the local community has been fully supportive of this pioneering initiative. With your support we can fund the beginnings of a new rehabilitation centre for many endangered animals in need.

    The Impact



The image above shows the consequences of illegal dynamite fishing and it's impact on the population of endangered monk seals in the area. Unfortunately this is not an isolated event. 

This project is important as it will create the only natural marine rehabilitation centre of it's type in the Aegean Sea. With this new facility we would be able to rehabilitate the animals in a natural but controlled environment. The bay will also serve as a fisheries hatchery. It will be able to replenish fish stocks in the area and keep them sustainable for local fishermen, as well as encouraging the marine animals to feed for themselves as part of their transition back into the wild.

Who we are?




First of all let us tell you a story


My name is David and my wife’s name is Linda, it has been 5 years since we met and now newlyweds. I arrived in the Seychelles in 2010 for tourism but I was far from imagining meeting the woman of my life. We decided to drop everything and settle there.
As having done my studies in agriculture the idea of creating a farm germinated in our head. Our beginnings were difficult because of lack of access to funds so we had to use our savings to start the business. Our first task was to clear the area with a large vegetation on the land. 






We then started to plant different kind of crops such as tomatoes sweet potatoes to sell on the local market and in parallel a compost production due to a request for access to organic fertilizers.





During a cleaning expedition we had the pleasure to come across a colony of wild bees, and then it strike us. We have always respected and appreciated this animal but now it all came clear in our mind that it will be our future.





While doing my researches we continued in our path to produce authentic and traditional, so we launched our jam and fresh juice with fruits from our farm, the delights of Rosine.




We also developed innovative growing techniques with a nice record for a local pumpkin of 5Kg.



And the launching of our compost in their little bags.





As you can see it is not ideas that we lack.


What is our project?
Our project starts simply from the alarming decline of bees in the world, I can give you  reference list of misfortunes that bees are facing all over the world and especially in the USA, France , Europe ... The whole world is affected by this disease.
The Seychelles still enjoy unspoiled nature due to its small area and lack of mass industrialization and intensive agriculture. Here everything is still traditional but with a very active economy through tourism and fisheries.
Seychelles is this little piece of paradise still existing on earth with
Its International Carnival of Victoria








The Coco de mer a unique fruit that grows only in Seychelles, this is not a joke







Its musicians playing tunes from a distant era







The Moutia a local dance bringing us back to the Pirates days with lively rhythms




And a so generous and well preserved nature by the country





Here bees are not touched by this great sickness affecting the industrialized countries. Producing honey in this sanctuary is also setting up a king of bee's bank if they were to disappear  from the world. Of course we cannot ensure a global restoration, but it's these small islands like ours that could one day save those little sentinels who every day make certain the pollination of plants and then food on your table.
Contributing towards our project is to give a chance to the Bees, it is also participating in a sustainable program with a strong environmental impact. In addition to that it's a chance to book a quality and crystal clear honey, with no chemicals directly at your home and sustain a dynamic and growing local economy.

Now let's talk business

Here is the list of materials needed to start our Bee Farm:

     Hives Langstroth Frame Hoffman 1000$
2kg
     Wax 50$
Packaging

That makes a total of 2495 $, allowing us to directly start the activity, we shall populate our hives with our bees already present on the farm and other swarms that we have booked with some colleagues. In our 5 years projection we aim a population of a 100 hives.
If we do not reach our goal, every dollar you have given us will serve to finance the basic equipment such as bee keeper suits plus smoker and if ever we exceed our goal, it will used to buy better equipment and / or buy other hives.
After getting the funds, every steps will be posted on our facebook page, letting you the possibility to follow us through the procedure.
We are targeting two types of market. First one the local market with the local people as well as 5 stars hotels and second one the exportation promoted by our geographic location, ""Seychelles Honey"" available on our online store.
We are aware that it is a lot of work, but we are young and have ambition. Even if you think with 5$ you cannot change the world, imagine with 10 000 people, were to take that step?

All of this requires that first step, donations to tighten up the houses, so they can be preserved without further damage, and to make it possible to begin bringing in income by renting shop space and residences.
 
  The Project In keeping with the historical nature of the village, our plan is to make the village a place of education and learning of the traditional, rural way of life. As with any rural village, we desire to have a mix of residences, skilled craftsmen, and retail sales. Our plan may become a model for how other historical villages can be preserved.       Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and tell everyone with interest in Yellow Dog Village about this campaign.

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about our mission, we hope you find it as interesting and important as we do. We will be conducting research on the Khumbu Glacier in Nepal this autumn and as part of this we want to engage, train, and inspire local students and researchers that would not otherwise have such opportunities. We believe this will help <b>improve preparedness and resilience in Nepal</b> to the environmental changes that the coming decades will bring. <br/></p>
<p>We are a team of glaciologists, remote sensors, and water resource researchers,  based at the University of Leeds studying the response of Himalayan glaciers to climate change. We do this using remote sensing techniques on <b>satellite imagery</b>, and through <b>fieldwork</b> on the <b>Khumbu Glacier</b> over the past decade (the glacier that is home to Everest Base Camp). This allows us to observe how fast the glaciers are moving, how glacial lakes form on and around glaciers, and how glaciers are melting in response to a changing climate.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432111015/doicd1ep1truv79mfutu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We know that the surface of glaciers can lower by several meters each year - i.e. the <b>ice is melting</b>, but the processes behind this are not yet fully understood. The thick layer of debris that covers many of the glaciers should insulate the ice beneath and therefore reduce the melt rate. However, this isn't the case on a glacier scale for many glaciers in the region. <b>Our fieldwork with your support will help us to better understand how Everest's glaciers are changing and how this will affect communities in Nepal and across the Himalaya.</b>  This will be published in high-impact peer-reviewed journals.<br/></p>
<p> Our goal is to develop effective ways of communicating our research that will enhance local decision making by engaging with the University of Kathmandu, and to increase public awareness of the importance of shrinking glaciers. Specifically how they will affect <b>local communities</b> and the millions of people that are dependent on melt water for irrigation and sanitation. While melting glaciers may seem like a short-term benefit (more water), glaciers are disappearing, and this changes how much and when the downstream communities receive water. You may have heard of a project to <b>build</b> <b>artificial glaciers</b> to store water and release it gradually to try and mitigate the effects of a changing climate. We urgently need to understand how these high altitude river basins will change to promote sustainable practices and development in Nepal and across the Himalaya.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>On the Khumbu Glacier:</h3>
<p>We will:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor the thermal properties of lakes that form on the surface of the glacier to understand how they promote melt of the underlying ice.</li>
<li>Deploy an OpenROV underwater exploration robot to get a unique perspective of the lake environment and help derive lake bathymetry so we can assess volume change over time.</li>
<li>Derive 3d digital elevation models using Structure-from-Motion technology to assess glacier surface change over time. This technology uses photos from any camera (even a smartphone) taken at different locations, to construct a 3d model. See an example from our pilot study below...<br/>

<p>Bees are under intense pressure from disease, monocrop agriculture and pesticides. Let's give them a helping hand with this urban beehive project in <b>Hamilton, Ontario</b>. With Toronto proclaiming itself as Canada's first Bee City. <b>Hamilton need to step up and show them how it is done. </b>With the colours of the Ticats beeing a perfect match for our honey producing friends it is only fitting that Hamilton becomes host to some residents who are as industrious as the rest of the city.<br/></p>

Bees are under intense pressure from disease, monocrop agriculture and pesticides. Let's give them a helping hand with this urban beehive project in Hamilton, Ontario. With Toronto proclaiming itself as Canada's first Bee City. Hamilton need to step up and show them how it is done. With the colours of the Ticats beeing a perfect match for our honey producing friends it is only fitting that Hamilton becomes host to some residents who are as industrious as the rest of the city.
Campaign Team

My name is Duane Hewitt and I have lived in Hamilton more than fifteen years off and on since I first came here as an undergraduate at McMaster University. I returned to Hamilton in 2005  and have since witnessed the revival of the Ambitious City reborn like a phoenix from the ashes of the steel mills with health care and entrepreneurs leading the way. 
I am a scientist and have been concerned for some time about the pressures facing pollinators. I have even put my money where my mouth is for this cause. In 2013 I supported the Indiegogo campaign  by the Ontario Beekeepers Association to Protect the Bees. Last year I purchased a beehive from the AKER urban farming Indiegogo campaign but unfortunately it was too late in the season for me to start the hive. This year I am able to start that hive but I would like to do more and with your help I can!
This year I am able to start that hive but I would like to do more and with your help we can! On June 4th a queen bee and her entourage coming to the AKER top bar hive. This campaign has the goal to support the expansion of this urban beehive project from one to four hives.


My name is Ashley Cooney. I have lived in Hamilton for my whole life, with the exception of while I was attending the University of Waterloo. I am very involved in the rescue community helping save the lives and be a voice for cats, dogs, and wildlife. I was first introduced to the plight of the bees by Duane and it seemed only natural that I should help them survive as well. Every life, no matter how big or small, long or short, matters. 
The Plight of the Bumble(Honey) Bee
So how can we help save the bees? The two most basic ways are to stop harming bees and start promoting good bee health. In order to do this, we need to move away from monoculture farming and the use of pesticides Ironically urban environments currently offer more hospitable environments than rural locations due to pesticide use and industrial farming.
 Your contribution to our campaign will allow us to
procure, set up, and maintain up to four (depending on your support!) bee hives
from local suppliers. These hives will house thousands of honey bees in the Westdale area of Hamilton near a Community Garden, which is surrounded by a
very suitable habitat for bees to forage. If sufficient funds are raised we
will install a pollinator garden to further support our bee colony. These bees
will be monitored by local beekeepers to ensure they are happy and healthy.

Stretch Goals
1) Bee Cam
If we achieve sufficient support we would like to participate in the Eyes on Hives project which has a camera which monitors the health of the hive by tracking activity. Backers will have an opportunity to watch the bees.
2) Custom Pollinator Garden
3) TBD

<br/><h2><b>The
Hidden Treasure of Laos</b></h2>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<p>
</p>
<p>Most people
have no idea that the jewel-green jungle-clad mountains of the landlocked
country of Laos are home to an astonishing level of natural biodiversity, a
treasure trove of beautiful, useful and mysterious plants. </p>
<p>In fact,
Laos has one of the <b>highest levels of biodiversity</b> in the world, but much
of this rich natural bounty hasn’t been identified, catalogued, or studied
yet.  Many species have yet to be even discovered.
</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466651990/BY4A9834_vwb49k.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 550.5px;height: 367px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>The Danger</b></h4>
<p>Now, with development, people are moving and building towns, planting crops and developing the country. This is wonderful for the people who will have a better life - but also a powerful threat to these plants and the traditions that surround them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466652089/DJI_0025_luvrqp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 559.5770392749245px;height: 315px;""/></p>
<br/>
<h4><b>The
Knowledge</b></h4>
<p>The mosaic
of ethnic groups that inhabit this rugged landscape have developed a deep understanding
of the uses - medicinal, culinary and spiritual - of these plants, but the
elders are the only keepers of this knowledge and little is written down.  <b>All could be lost within one generation !<br/></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>Time for
Action</b></h4>
<p>Now is the time
to make sure that this precious natural heritage is not lost. Preservation and
education are the answers.</p>
<p><b>The good
news is that an extraordinary project is already under way</b> to find, catalogue,
propagate and study this wealth of plants and to understand their
ethno-botanical history and future uses.</p>
<p>Pha Tad Ke
Botanical Garden, the first ever in Laos, will open to the public soon after
many years of research and hard work, and we need all the help we can get to
make sure it happens.</p>
<p>Soon
visitors will be able to stroll the paths among the medicinal gardens and walk along the spectacular limestone habitat.  The sheer beauty of hundreds and
hundreds of plants will be revealed in a stunning setting on the Mekong River in Luang Prabang,
the World-Heritage-listed former capital. </p>
<p>There will
be beautiful food and handicrafts, but, even more important to the future of
Laos and the planet, are the extensive educational and cultural programs, the
future research facility, the herbarium and many more features to come.</p>
<p>You can help
make sure that the careless development that has
ruined so many places does not happen here in this tiny natural paradise.
People need to understand the need for saving biodiversity by preserving
species, and for stopping climate change through education.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><b>How are we protecting traditional knowledge?</b></h2>
<p><b>Scientific
Research </b>- Pha Tad Ke is actively collecting and cataloguing plant species in Lao. We study plant identification, domestic and wild propagation, and preserve plant resources for future reference. Hopefully with proper funding we can expand our research projects.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466652198/leuat_khouay_bay_gnay...._rh9rrr.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 372px;height: 279px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>Cataloguing </b>- Working alongside village elders traditional knowledge can be documented. Recording the species and their uses saves the knowledge from disappearing. Classifying new species lets the world know of their existence!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466652227/P1070996_gebpif.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 377.4814814814815px;height: 252px;""/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Education -</b> Spreading the knowledge is one of the fastest ways to protect it!  The knowledge of PTK Botanical is spread through our ethno-botanic garden, </span>children's<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> garden, community workshops, and publications.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Publications </b>- Making the information available and protecting knowledge through the written word is an education tactic for long term conservation.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Conservation -</b> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To protect bio-diversity is to protect the knowledge of plants. For the last seven years we have worked on protecting bio-diversity with a mix of scientific research, cataloguing, education, publications, and ex-situ conservation.  As we generate more income we will expand our conservation efforts on a larger scale. </span></p>
<h2><b>WHAT WE ARE FUNDING</b></h2>
<p>We will be funding the building of our ethno-botanic garden.  Ethno-botany is the scientific term for the study of the relationships that exist between people and plants.</p>
<p><b>Our Garden will have ten sub-themed gardens:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Medicinal plants for skin problems</li>
<li>Medicinal plants for digestive health </li>
<li>Medicinal plants for women's health <br/>
</li>
<li>Medicinal plants to treat fractures<br/>
</li>
<li>Plants for the spirits and their numerous ceremonies and festivals<br/>
</li>
<li>Plants for dying used in traditional cotton and silk weaving<br/>
</li>
<li>Fiber plants used for weaving and basketry or to make paper</li>
<li>Plants used in everyday life by the Hmong ethnic group<br/>
</li>
<li>Medicinal plants for elephants</li>
<li>Poisonous plants </li>
</ul>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>This will include money for:</b></span><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Plantings and plant conservation<br/>
</li>
<li>Educational signage</li>
<li>Research on unknown plants from the wild</li>
</ul>
<p><b>This garden is an essential part of preserving traditional knowledge for two reasons:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><i>It keeps traditional knowledge alive by sharing it with the people that visit the garden.</i></li>
<li>
<i>We open to the public in November.  This garden will be the center piece to our garden.  Creating a sustainable revenue stream by opening our garden to the public is crucial in funding all of our projects including scientific research, cataloguing, education, and publications to keep traditional knowledge alive. </i><br/>

<h4><b>Globally</b></h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The knowledge of medicinal plants is priceless for health (not just in Laos but all over the world)</b> - a<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">dvancements in biotech, pharmaceuticals, and human healthcare industries are based off the medicinal properties of plants.  </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b> Lessons on fighting climate change and sustainability can be learned from traditional knowledge</b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Minimizes risk for a community instead of maximizing profits </b>- By keeping traditional knowledge alive it keeps rural communities strong.  It creates a strong foundation to withstand development that could threaten a community's culture. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h4><b>Locally</b></h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Traditional knowledge is tried and tested over long periods of time and well adapted to a specific location</b> - what works in one area of the world doesn't always work in another. <b> Diversity is key!  </b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Directing Luang Prabang tourism in a sustainable direction </b>- with tourism rapidly increasing it's important to create visitor attractions that nurture local customs and ecosystems. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>If traditional knowledge is lost, the information on how to live off the land is lost. </b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Protecting knowledge for future generations.</b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Conserving plants that are threatened </b>- by keeping the knowledge alive we are keeping the plant behind the knowledge alive, literally, in our garden. We would also eventually like to extend conservation efforts outside of our garden. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Benefit the national economy </b>- all of our proceeds go directly back into the company and company projects.  This means all money coming in stays directly in Laos.  <br/>

The
Hidden Treasure of Laos




Most people
have no idea that the jewel-green jungle-clad mountains of the landlocked
country of Laos are home to an astonishing level of natural biodiversity, a
treasure trove of beautiful, useful and mysterious plants. 
In fact,
Laos has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world, but much
of this rich natural bounty hasn’t been identified, catalogued, or studied
yet.  Many species have yet to be even discovered.





The Danger
Now, with development, people are moving and building towns, planting crops and developing the country. This is wonderful for the people who will have a better life - but also a powerful threat to these plants and the traditions that surround them.


The
Knowledge
The mosaic
of ethnic groups that inhabit this rugged landscape have developed a deep understanding
of the uses - medicinal, culinary and spiritual - of these plants, but the
elders are the only keepers of this knowledge and little is written down.  All could be lost within one generation !

Time for
Action
Now is the time
to make sure that this precious natural heritage is not lost. Preservation and
education are the answers.
The good
news is that an extraordinary project is already under way to find, catalogue,
propagate and study this wealth of plants and to understand their
ethno-botanical history and future uses.
Pha Tad Ke
Botanical Garden, the first ever in Laos, will open to the public soon after
many years of research and hard work, and we need all the help we can get to
make sure it happens.
Soon
visitors will be able to stroll the paths among the medicinal gardens and walk along the spectacular limestone habitat.  The sheer beauty of hundreds and
hundreds of plants will be revealed in a stunning setting on the Mekong River in Luang Prabang,
the World-Heritage-listed former capital. 
There will
be beautiful food and handicrafts, but, even more important to the future of
Laos and the planet, are the extensive educational and cultural programs, the
future research facility, the herbarium and many more features to come.
You can help
make sure that the careless development that has
ruined so many places does not happen here in this tiny natural paradise.
People need to understand the need for saving biodiversity by preserving
species, and for stopping climate change through education.



How are we protecting traditional knowledge?
Scientific
Research - Pha Tad Ke is actively collecting and cataloguing plant species in Lao. We study plant identification, domestic and wild propagation, and preserve plant resources for future reference. Hopefully with proper funding we can expand our research projects.  



Cataloguing - Working alongside village elders traditional knowledge can be documented. Recording the species and their uses saves the knowledge from disappearing. Classifying new species lets the world know of their existence!



Education - Spreading the knowledge is one of the fastest ways to protect it!  The knowledge of PTK Botanical is spread through our ethno-botanic garden, children's garden, community workshops, and publications.
Publications - Making the information available and protecting knowledge through the written word is an education tactic for long term conservation. Pha Tad Ke publishes its findings in children's books, manuals, and teacher manuals.  These books are available for download in Laos or English for free from our website, pha-tad-ke.com



Conservation - To protect bio-diversity is to protect the knowledge of plants. For the last seven years we have worked on protecting bio-diversity with a mix of scientific research, cataloguing, education, publications, and ex-situ conservation.  As we generate more income we will expand our conservation efforts on a larger scale. 
WHAT WE ARE FUNDING
We will be funding the building of our ethno-botanic garden.  Ethno-botany is the scientific term for the study of the relationships that exist between people and plants.
Our Garden will have ten sub-themed gardens:


Medicinal plants for skin problems
Medicinal plants for digestive health 
Medicinal plants for women's health 

Medicinal plants to treat fractures

Plants for the spirits and their numerous ceremonies and festivals

Plants for dying used in traditional cotton and silk weaving

Fiber plants used for weaving and basketry or to make paper
Plants used in everyday life by the Hmong ethnic group

Medicinal plants for elephants
Poisonous plants 


This will include money for:



Plantings and plant conservation

Educational signage
Research on unknown plants from the wild

This garden is an essential part of preserving traditional knowledge for two reasons:


It keeps traditional knowledge alive by sharing it with the people that visit the garden.

We open to the public in November.  This garden will be the center piece to our garden.  Creating a sustainable revenue stream by opening our garden to the public is crucial in funding all of our projects including scientific research, cataloguing, education, and publications to keep traditional knowledge alive. 



THIS MATTERS!


Globally



The knowledge of medicinal plants is priceless for health (not just in Laos but all over the world) - advancements in biotech, pharmaceuticals, and human healthcare industries are based off the medicinal properties of plants.  


 Lessons on fighting climate change and sustainability can be learned from traditional knowledge


Minimizes risk for a community instead of maximizing profits - By keeping traditional knowledge alive it keeps rural communities strong.  It creates a strong foundation to withstand development that could threaten a community's culture. 



Locally



Traditional knowledge is tried and tested over long periods of time and well adapted to a specific location - what works in one area of the world doesn't always work in another.  Diversity is key!  


Directing Luang Prabang tourism in a sustainable direction - with tourism rapidly increasing it's important to create visitor attractions that nurture local customs and ecosystems. 


If traditional knowledge is lost, the information on how to live off the land is lost. 


Protecting knowledge for future generations.


Conserving plants that are threatened - by keeping the knowledge alive we are keeping the plant behind the knowledge alive, literally, in our garden. We would also eventually like to extend conservation efforts outside of our garden. 


Benefit the national economy - all of our proceeds go directly back into the company and company projects.  This means all money coming in stays directly in Laos.  




OUR PERKS 
We would LOVE to send you goody bags through the mail.  Unfortunately the mail system is very expensive from Laos.  We are instead pre-selling excursion tickets at a discounted price.  We really want you to come join us in our journey. If you can't, you will still receive an online picture portfolio and you can support our good cause! Pha Tad Ke is affiliated with the Luang Prabang Fund for Culture and Conservation, an American 501(c)3 non-profit organisation. All Contributions made to Pha Tad Ke through the crowdfunding campaign are through the LPFCC and are tax deductible in the US.

Plants are all around us...

According to the monk's book of discipline, robes are naturally dyed and woven.  Different sect around the world have different colors dependent on the natural dyes available to them.  Here in Laos we have a beautiful orange.

<h3>Bears Ears National Monument: Monument under Threat</h3>
<div>On December 28, 2016, President Obama, using the Antiquities Act, created Bears Ears National Monument in Southeastern Utah, which is already under threat of disappearing. In an unprecedented move, the legislature of Utah is asking to have the monument overturned (articles <a href=""http://fox13now.com/2017/02/03/senate-clashes-over-resolution-to-rescind-bears-ears-national-monument/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://utahpoliticalcapitol.com/2017/02/03/bears-ears-resolution-fast-tracked-for-signing-by-governor/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, and <a href=""http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865672545/Utah-Legislature-votes-to-shed-Bears-Ears-monument-designation.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). <i>Bears Ears National Monument: Monument under Threat</i> will document the Bears Ears National Monument and what <i>we</i> the American people potentially stand to lose. This is no small undertaking as the monument covers 1.35-million acres, which is broken into a number of distinct areas, and time limited. The map below provides a glimpse into the enormity of this new monument.</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485485372/qicp5covdh5pzdzzsypo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Embarking April 2017, I will dedicate the remainder of 2017 to the creation of <i>Bears Ears National Monument: Monument under Threat</i>. Even with the amount of time dedicated to this project, the fieldwork schedule is going to be extremely hectic; large portions of the monument are only accessible by foot. As an accomplished backpacker, hauling 15+ pounds of camera gear into the backcountry is not an issue, but it does make for very long days. While the book’s shot list and shooting schedule are still under development, with new items added every few days, you can see the most up to date shot-list and shooting plans here: <a href=""http://olderadventurer.com/2017/02/shot-list-for-bears-ears-national-monument-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shot List for Bears Ears National Monument Project</a>. </p>
<p>There is a strong sense of urgency in documenting this national monument because on February 3, 2017, the governor of Utah signed a state law calling on President Trump to undo Bears Ears National Monument (see, <a href=""http://fox13now.com/2017/02/03/senate-clashes-over-resolution-to-rescind-bears-ears-national-monument/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Governor signs resolution to rescind Bears Ears National Monument</a>). No national monument of this size has ever been undone and there currently is not any law President Trump can use to revoke a national monument, but that doesn’t mean they won’t try. It will take an act of Congress to undo Bears Ears National Monument, but given that one of the stated goals of the GOP platform is getting rid of public lands, it is only a matter of time before it happens; hence the urgency of this project. (See the GOP Platform section <a href=""https://www.gop.com/platform/americas-natural-resources/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">America's Natural Resources: Agriculture, Energy, and the Environment</a>, subsection <i>Environmental Progress</i>, paragraph seven)</p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484689486/orjjiqm8lifr0kqvky8o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The goals of <i>Bears Ears National Monument: Monument under Threat </i>project is multifold and goes far beyond this crowdfunding campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>To employ photography to document the beauty to be found in Bears Ears National Monument</li>
<li>Creating a photographic collection and making these images publicly accessible online.</li>
<li>Building an online community through use of digital platforms where interested parties can follow the project and participate.</li>
<li>Producing a photo-book documenting Bears Ears National Monument, through both photography and the written word.</li>
<li>Producing a 2018 calendar highlighting the best images from the project</li>
<li>A gallery showing. Sometime in the first half of 2018, <i>Bears Ears National Monument: Monument under Threat </i>will host a gallery showing, highlighting the best pieces from the project.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486566448/bxw1czabf93w3owgeyuo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Having always been a supporter of <i>our</i> public lands, a nature photographer and writer, and given the current political environment, I feel it is extremely important we stand up for our public lands right now more than ever. This photobook is about more than just preserving what <i>may</i> be the fleeting life of a new national monument; Bears Ears National Monument is simply the latest battleground of the war on our public lands and I want to document what we stand to lose. I want to be able to show those in power, “this is what we stand to lose and this is what we are protecting.”</p>
<p>I am also doing this because I love photography, writing, nature, and documenting the beauty of the world around us. More importantly, I enjoy sharing the beauty I find in the world with others, through both my photography and my writing. What better way to do all the things I love than to put together a project that calls on all these things! Hence, that is how the idea for <i>Bears Ears National Monument: Monument under Threat</i> was born.</p>
<h2>What you will help create</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486565488/q6snpq44ue70e7cvnd1v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://olderadventurer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Blog</strong></a>: A minimum of twice a week I will post on the website on the project. Blog post topics will touch on a variety of subjects: adventures in backpacking, camping, off-roading, adventures, or creative collaborations.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong>: I want to create enriching content on all forms of social media so fans can keep in touch with me throughout the entire project. Find and follow me on: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/olderadventurer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/isabellesaintpierre/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/IsabelleStPier2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Photo Book</strong>: the ultimate goal of this project is publishing an 80-page, 10 x 8 inches (25x20 cm) full-color softcover photography book with a mixture of full-page and smaller collections of the landscapes found in Bears Ears National Monument. The estimated delivery date for the book is the first to second week of December 2017, making it a great holiday gift idea!</p>
<p><strong>Calendar</strong>: a full-color calendar for 2018 highlighting the 13 best images from the project and it will be available the first to second week of December 2017.</p>
<h2>Budget</h2>
<p>Undertaking a project of this depth and magnitude and dedicating 2017 to this project requires serious investment. Putting in my time, energy, expertise, and personal financial resources, I have committed myself to this project's success. I am, however, in need of some assistance. To achieve the project's outcomes, <i>Bears Ears National Monument: Monument under Threat </i>project needs to raise $6,000 to fund this project. The funds will be dedicated to the following categories:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486520985/gitppnqysufrdph5jqkp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The biggest portion of the budget is going towards travel at 77%, which should not be surprising given the 1.35 million acres the monument covers (for comparison, the state of Delaware is 1.25 million acres). As they say, nothing is free and 8% of monies raised will go to crowdfunding and associated fees (5% to Indiegogo and 3% to credit card processing fees). The remaining 15% will be used for the production of the goodies you picked when backing this project.</p>
<h2>Project Risks</h2>

<p>All projects entail a certain amount of risk, but the key is identifying those risks and having contingency plans for those risks. <i>Bears Ears National Monument: Monument under Threat </i>has a number of risks associated with it, as any major project does.</p>
<h3>Mechanical problems could interrupt the project</h3>
<p>Any project that is dependent upon a vehicle of any kind could potentially have to deal with a mechanical breakdown, fire, theft, or simply getting stuck. Many areas of Bears Ears National Monument only have dirt roads, limited services, and some require a high-clearance vehicle, so getting stuck can be a real issue.</p>
<p>To help mitigate these potential risks, the project has roadside assistance and other necessities are carried to help get out of most of the situations which may arise.</p>
<h3>Equipment issues could interrupt the expedition</h3>
<p>Any number pieces of equipment could fail or be stolen, either of which would cause an interruption to the project. To help mitigate these possible problems, the projects cameras and computer equipment are insured for both breakage and theft.</p>
<h3>A plethora of things could happen</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484693592/x9aixgmhckslzdk4pmip.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are tons of little things that could happen which could have an impact on the project. Heck, I could lock the keys in the van in the middle of nowhere, with no cell phone service, and the closest service being 60-miles away. Yes, I like hiking and do it frequently, but a 60-mile hike to get someone to unlock the van is not something I would want to do.</p>
<p>The key is to not let the little problems mushroom into bigger ones, keeping a clear head, and meeting each challenge as they come. It helps to look at these things as just part of the journey; it is our reaction to adversity that matters most.</p>
<h3>Failing to reach the funding goal</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484694048/jhrgnd5gru42has8vfvk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Not reaching my funding goal is a real possibility, however not reaching the funding goal does not mean the end of the project; it simply means scaling it back. This <i>could </i>mean shortening the length of time in the field, skipping some of the lesser-known locations, and other areas that can be trimmed.</p>

Have a look below.It will be a big and beautiful cartographic paper map, paying tribute to the city we love. It is also the start of a dialogue about the importance of nature in the urban environment. Visualising the green - and the blue - you can use the map to explore the many ways in which the urban green can be used: imagine an outdoor classroom, a working space or an allotment. The Green Map of Amsterdam will be something that any person who cares about urban nature would like to have: a map every school in Amsterdam can use to make kids more interested in the urban green, a map which can inspire companies and every person working and living here to lead a healthier lifestyle, a map any visitor or expat can use to literally draw his or her own journey into the urban green. Just like the map of London, the map of Amsterdam will be a large-format, folded paper map – printed by the best cartographic press in Europe. The green map of Amsterdam will be a beautiful, unique and custom drawn map to highlight places to explore: i.e. parks, green roofs, the canals, places to work, relax and sport outdoors, city farms for children and much more. The reverse side of the map will be used to provide more information and key facts about the city. In order to do this we will reach out to the other initiatives which are involved in making Amsterdam a healthier and greener city.

<p>·When was the last time you stopped to consider how your life, your choices, your actions impact the world around?  Not just for now, but for generations to come.</p>
<p>It was about 8 years ago that I stopped to consider the amount of TV I was watching, the lifestyle I was living  and the various type of noise that was around me.</p>

<p>To be aware and open on the Journey of life is very important. That’s how we accumulate knowledge, learn new things and discover new things that we would normally not find; if it were closed or ignored.  We live in a vibrant and dynamic world, full of life and color.

<p>Today, with our busy environment and the vast amounts of distraction around us such as toys, electronics and other type noise in our environment. It can be difficult to connect to ourselves. It can be difficult to connect to others, to connect with them, to get to know them and cultivate relationships that we all need.</p>
<p>It is so important to be aware of who we are, to connect to ourselves and learn to grow and change. Important to connect to a community and be part of a family; to share our experiences, our knowledge and belong to something. And it’s important that we  connect to our environment. We are as much a part of the environment as it is a part of us, it works interdependently, it is sacred and lots of gifts to offer.</p>
<p>These documentaries helped me to see my interactions and connections in a different light.  They showed me opportunities to nurture myself, my relationships and the planet.</p>

Pedimos
apoyo para conmemorar el Día Mundial de los Océanos 2016, Tejiendo Mares de Solidaridad.
La Fundación Biodiversidad del Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentación y Medio
Ambiente, nos ha otorgado una ayuda que recibiremos si logramos ejecutar con
éxito la totalidad del proyecto.

Desde
los centros y residencias de mayores y personas con enfermedad mental donde
actuamos queremos tejer dos grandes mantas azules que representarán dos océanos
gigantes con sus amenazas y sus beneficios. Cubriremos dos edificios
emblemáticos de las ciudades de Madrid y Valencia. Asimismo, jóvenes de centros
educativos investigarán sobre las amenazas y beneficios que nos reportan los
océanos para representarlos en las mantas tejidas, además aprenderán a tejer y
a confeccionar las mantas uniendo cuadrados. Una vez pase el evento, el 8 de
junio, el gran océano tejido se desmantelará y se convertirá en mantas para
familias sin recursos.
¿Quiénes somos?
 Somos una
Asociación sin ánimo de lucro que se dedica a tejer mantas en residencias y
centros de mayores y/o de personas con enfermedad mental destinadas a familias
sin recursos y centros de refugiados. Nuestro objetivo es que las personas mayores
y personas con enfermedad mental participen en proyectos de la comunidad y dar
abrigo a personas necesitadas. Nuestra causa va a ser la protección de los
océanos.  El impacto 
Se trata de un proyecto social,
donde se implica la actividad de personas mayores y de personas con enfermedad
mental en acciones de la Comunidad, se produce además un intercambio
generacional. 
Es un proyecto ambiental, donde todos estos colectivos (mayores,
personas con enfermedad mental y jóvenes) se unen para sensibilizar sobre la
protección de los océanos. 
Es un proyecto solidario, donde se espera dar abrigo
a más de 2.000 familias sin recursos. 

Se trata de apoyar la protección de los océanos.
Se trata de aportar nuestro ""punto"" de solidaridad
Se trata de ser creativo e intentar hacer cosas positivas para proteger
Se trata de tomar conciencia de los problemas que hay a nuestro alrededor
   Riesgos y desafíos  
Tejemos
por un océano saludable para un planeta saludable. Unimos los esfuerzos de
personas mayores, personas con enfermedad mental, jóvenes, distintos organismos
e instituciones para concienciar sobre la protección de los océanos, de una
manera creativa y solidaria.

<b>Overall Philosophy</b>: Museum exhibits would be permanent, and include a 
big picture, planet wide approach to climate issues.  A strong emphasis 
would be placed on topics that affect all of civilization, such as 
agriculture, disruption of water supplies, disease, sea level rise, and 
climate refugees.  The museums would not house collections or conduct 
research, focusing instead on education. <br/></p>
<b>How much money is needed now? </b>We are asking for $10,000 to establish our legal, nonprofit status, research existing exhibits and school programs, and promote the concept among local educators, community leaders and philanthropists.  If our goal is not reached, we will continue to promote the concept and seek additional funds. <br/><br/>I have directed a nonprofit and managed its finances for twenty years without going over budget while forging a positive relationship between government and other stakeholders.

We want this project to change lives, not just record one album and then move on...….it’s activist in its ambition, offering portals for new ways of seeing, being, and creating that doesn't cost the earth. The first half of the funding is for the building of the studio and the recording of the Kuki and the Bard album.;... the second half is for a bursary to enable other young musicians that couldn't otherwise afford it to come and record using the power of nature....
We’ll be using… For the build. straw bales, earthbags, pallets, trees from our woodland, recycled windows and doors, hempcrete, gravel for foundations, roofing beams, telegraph poles, sheeps wool insulation, For the sound, monitors, headphones, mixing desk, interface with converters and pre-amps, microphones, headphone splitters, cables, audio computer and software, solar panels, wind turbine, sine wave inverter, batteries and of course a fusebox to keep it safe !!!....With food and accomodation for volunteers the whole build has been budgeted at £20,000
 
We will be making this studio available for use by youth organisations and individuals working with young people from different backgrounds and of different needs. For this we need to raise a bursary for young musicians to come and use the recording studio, including transport, accomodation and food . This we’ve budgeted at a further £20,000
There's also of course the cost of the perks for this campaign and the indiegogo commission.

to a new survey more than 50% of kids in Europe today play outside less than
once a week.<b>Twenty
eight percent of them haven't been on a country walk in the last year, 21% have
never been to a farm and 20% have never climbed a tree. </b>Another one states that “just five

figures may be a little lower for Bulgarian kids, the lack of outdoor time is a
worldwide problem.</p>

Bulgaria. <b>We offer you a connection with wildlife and farm life through the

mountain. The animals have been saved from certain situations to come to us and

hard-working and always looking for new opportunities. Some of us are part of
Balkani from the beginning, while others became doctors of science, professors and public figures. 
We have worked hard to create lasting professional relationships with
institutions, Nature Park Directorates, other NGOs, civil groups and
universities. 
Our organization runs two information education centres that give
visitors the chance to get one step closer to nature. As its name suggests the Wetlands Conservation Centre “Dragoman Marsh” is
located near the Dragoman marsh and the Chepan hill – one of the most valuable
nature territories near Sofia and a unique combination of wetlands and karst
hills with impressive plant and animal species. The second one is the Large
Carnivore Education Centre that we are currently gathering funds for. (For more
information, please read the information above.)

<p>The Valdez Ice Climbing Festival is an annual event supported by the American Alpine Club and Access Fund. It helps us support our mission which is to care for and build trails as well as provide outdoor rec education through clinics and workshops! Come Send it with us in 2022!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need love from the community which also shows our grantors that the clinics, workshops, and trail work we provide are valuable to residents and visitors!</li>
<li>In exchange for your show of support, we want to give you the best experience ever! Let us help you plan your trip - whether you're full on dirt bag or diva, we got you covered.</li>
<li>Your funds go to supporting humans and the wild lands around us. We definitely are into supporting people's dreams - so to all the outside explorers, adventurers, those who are taking and took the time to learn ice climbing and safety proficiency, We Support You! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, some of our instructors and event participants come from outside Valdez. That Means it is Up To Us to maintain the trails which makes routes available not only for climbers, but fat bikers, hikers, and other outdoor enthusiasts. This takes fuel, tools, manpower, and sometimes large equipment. But this is just what we love to do! </li>
<li>Winter Maintenance: we have community members that go out and pack snow and test routes. Of course, sometimes volunteers are unavailable. Either way we supply fuel or reimburse for time or other supplies that might be required. Often the winter will create some damage (and sometimes we have to respond to vandals), which will require additional repairs and maintenance. Also, to access some of our trails and camping areas we have to hire people to plow snow. All in all, it can be a lot!</li>
<li>Spring Maintenance: When the green starts growing back, we've got to send people out to trim branches, work the dirt, and make sure there are no hazards as well as clean up from the thaw (that said, we love our dog owners!). Also, since spring still means snow, sometimes we still need to plow snow. We also have port-a-potties, garbage and cabin/ campground areas that need cleaning and revitalizing. We support a campground host to help us out during the summer months as well.</li>
<li>Your support goes a long way, let me tell you. And we are grateful! We want visitors and residents alike to fully enjoy and respect this incredible wild land. Reach out anytime for questions, comments, feedback, or to plan your next visit.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>2020 certainly provided some challenges for us. We created a COVID mitigation plan and stuck with it. Part of that plan was getting feedback from the participants of our near sold out event - and we are more than pleased to report no incidents.</li>
<li>Traditionally we have received support from the city and other grantors. This is never a guarantee. Fees alone will not prove a sustainable event which is why we reach out, hold fund raisers, and find other sponsors! We can only hope Black Diamond, HyperLite, Petzl, The Prospector, The Fat Mermaid, The North Face and other businesses will continue to be a part of this fantastic event.</li>

<p>Li’s vision stretches beyond permaculture designs and sustainable living. We aim at reestablishing the connection between the culture and habitats we currently live in and the ones we previously cherished before we moved into an excessive and demanding lifestyle.</p>
<p>The more we observe that fact, the more we realize that nature does not tolerate excess. Our nature as beings reached a point where it has traded abundance for excess. Infinite growth is destructive, sustainability is balance.</p>
<p>We receive by giving, first the luxury of a retreat to raw nature, to learning different concepts (in local communities, schools, researchers. summer campers, practitioners, nature lovers, and curious observers) from organic planting, to harvesting, to eco building, to social responsibility ; A space for workshops/talks, hands-on experience where people can shape ideas, knowledge &amp; skills.</p>
<p>Workshops raise curiosity, results create initiative in others, and more results create a trend and then a momentum.</p>
<p>We are neither a venture nor a venue, we are somehow collaborators of change, and we are learning that along the way, all channels tend to have an impact directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>The project started with a series of workshops hosted by local and international people, starting with vermin-compost toilets to a cob oven, wood working and finally the building of an earth bag dome hobbit house</p>
<p>The idea was to teach others the process of building one’s own house with minimum cost from limited resources they can acquire from their own land. Smart and simple systems can be installed (passive solar, gray water, rocket mass heater  ...) that would allow them to benefit more from nature's abundance as an alternative to investing money and thus time to pay unnecessary bills. </p>
<p>Our vision aims at making a difference while interacting with nature, by substituting nature’s exploitation with nature’s appreciation.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<li>The funding will be going to mostly buying the material and finishing our second phase of our earth bag hobbit house which consists of plastering, insulating, burying and planting the roof. From the inside, the funding will help us close the house with windows , doors &amp; skylights  </li>
<li>The rest of the house will be built through workshops to teach people and further propagate the knowledge. Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited</li>
<li>With each donation, you will get a free access to our workshops, a 3 day stay &amp;  a free organic basket that consists of fruits, veggies, eggs &amp; organic products such as deodorant. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>From strong believers to trendy followers, our service to the greater good has been planned to reach the knowledge and mutual contribution part way before the commodification aspect.</p>
<p>We are heading there, and we will get where we are going faster with the help of any contribution. Those who see it growing will start it on their own, and it’s a responsible start and a chance for change.</p>

<h3>What is Carbon Deed?</h3>
<p>We are a Finnish forest startup on the mission to allow all of us a more sustainable way of life by offering a way to compensate for your CO₂ emissions with ease. We provide permanent carbon removal (also known as carbon farming) services to individuals and companies by growing forest efficiently. </p>
<p>Be aware, we are not an industrial foresting company and we do not grow our forests for economic purposes. Our target is to maximize CO₂ absorption of forests, while also cultivating biodiversity and natural life. This means we only plant trees to unused land and will grow the trees for as long as possible.</p>
<p>For the time being forests are the only globally recognized feasible method of carbon removal at a large scale. Forests are not only very efficient at capturing CO₂, but the results are also measurable and verifiable. </p>
<p>Finland has the highest forest to land ratio in the world, and also the biggest forest companies, thus it is an ideal place for founding a forest-technology start-up. Prior to founding Carbon Deed we’ve received support from some of the most knowledgeable forestation experts in the world (e.g. University of Helsinki and the Forestation administrative of Finland). We have fine-tuned our approach based on these discussions and validated our Carbon farming business plan. The amount of support and the involvement of experts will expand as we progress with Carbon Deed. </p>
<p>Our process is very simple and we do all of this ourselves: ​<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569079195/hzqoyt7ysxmpl6hiihnl.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>We buy unused land in Finland, for example old farm land. We plant it with trees and make sure they grow as fast as possible. Each tree is given a unique tree identifier (UTI) by which all trees are linked to contributors. When the trees start growing, we measure their CO₂ absorption. </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Goal of the Indiegogo campaign:</strong></p>
<p>To plant the first trees and reach a broader audience with Carbon Deed, we are looking for an initial 20,000 EUR. </p>
<p>We have set up a limited liability company for purchasing the land area. We have a ready-made plan for planting the trees – we will take action immediately after the Indiegogo campaign ends.</p>
<p>We also have first-hand experience of planting trees in Finland – we’ve done it ourselves. </p>
<p><strong>How we would spend the funding:</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our initial ask of 20,000 EUR is planned to be spent as follows: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Estimated 13,000 - 17,000 for purchase of the required land area (depending on what exact land areas are for sale at the time)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">All the remaining funds will go to the purchase of trees in the total amount of bought carbon dioxide removal</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In case of exceeding our funding goal, we will simply purchase more land and more trees</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">NOTE: the 20,000 EUR does not include any personnel costs. For the time being we are all employed and thus able to work with 0 personnel costs. As Carbon Deed grows, the amount of administrative work is of course going to grow with it, and in the long-term we plan to employ ourselves and others in the enterprise. </span></p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>In addition to removing the CO₂ on your behalf, you will get a Carbon Deed Certificate of CO₂ removal equal to the amount you have contributed to the campaign. The CO₂ emission calculations are based on average OECD per capita figures, which shows that average citizen living in a OECD country has yearly CO₂ emissions of 10.9 tons.</p>
<p>Our Indiegogo campaign has four different packages:</p>
<ol>
<li>13 € - remove 1 tonne of CO₂ from the atmosphere by planting one tree ( 1 month of OECD average citizen's emissions)</li>
<li>38 € - remove 3 tonnes of CO₂ from the atmosphere by planting three trees (3 months of OECD average citizen's emissions)</li>
<li>154 € - remove 12 tonnes of CO₂ from the atmosphere by planting twelve trees (12 months of OECD average citizen's emissions) </li>
<li>13,952 € - remove 1200 tonnes of CO₂ from the atmosphere by planting twelvehundred trees (equal to a lifetime's emissions) </li>
</ol>
<p>All IndieGoGo supporters also get their names under our website’s hall of fame “People that made Carbon Deed possible.""</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every second, more than 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere. This amounts to 36,000 000 000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Reducing carbon emissions is crucial to mitigate the effects of our changing climate. As we can't suddenly stop producing emissions, the value of carbon farming is to neutralize our emissions. This is done by removing CO₂ from the atmosphere and binding it to newly planted forest.</p>
<p>One tree absorbs 1 ton of carbon over its cautious lifetime estimate of 40 years. This means that planting as few as 5-20 new trees every year can neutralize your personal CO2 emissions, depending on how much you emit per year. </p>
<p>We periodically examine our forests to ensure optimal CO₂ absorption. Our forests are insured against natural disasters. If a tree needs to be harvested we make sure it is used in long-term causes, such as building material.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As our business is based on growing forests, there always exists a risk of a natural disaster that has the potential to destroy part of our forest or seeds planted. Our approach to risk mitigation in case of a natural disaster is three-fold: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Location</strong> we plant our seeds and grow the forest in Finland, where natural disasters are very uncommon. Our forests are covered by Finnish forest regulation which has proven to be a historically successful form of pre-emptive protection. </li>
<li>
<strong>Forest insurance</strong> all our forests are insured against natural disasters by an insurance partner. In case of a natural disaster that would wipe out our forest, we will receive compensation amounting to the amount of CO₂ currently removed the atmosphere. This compensation will go directly to re-forestation and a forest preservation program to minimize the effects of CO₂ emitted back to the atmosphere.</li>
<li>
<strong>Over compensation</strong> for each ten trees planted, we will plant an additional tree. In effect this extra tree ton is a hedge against natural disaster. In practice, this means that even if 10% of the forest we have planted burnt down, which is highly unlikely in Finland, the CO2 removal you have paid for has still been removed.</li>
</ol>
<p>An existential risk for our business is that we do not have enough time to remove CO₂. That is why we need to act sooner rather than later, planting as much forest as possible to reduce the CO₂ levels in the atmosphere. Do your Carbon Deed and join us today!</p>

<p>
<span>The risk is that the US and/or Jamaican government 
agencies, such as the FDA would make the importation of Almonds  more 
challenging. The challenge to us is to cross every T and dot every I, </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">when 
it comes to Organic Certifications and required testing. However, this is not 
rocket science and having our COO, Allen F McSherry over-seeing our Regulatory 
Affairs department will be a great asset. Mr. McSherry is a licensed Pharmacist 
in five US states and very familiar with the scientific aspects of our project. 
Additionally, the government of Jamaica is working with our company to ensure 
that this new industry comes to fruition, as everyone is in agreement that we’re 
talking about a Super-food here that can only have positive results with Jamaica 
sharing their almonds with other countries.</span></p>

and pasteurization equipment to the collection of almond’s work-flow from local 
farmers.</span></p>
<p>
<span>It’s important to point out that perhaps the most 
important emphasis of this journey, as stated in </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">our 
Mission Statement, is “our emphasis will be to maintain the farming of Jamaican 
organic almonds while utilizing as many processes as possible to ensure the 
utilization of local farmers for a higher quality of life in the country of 
Jamaica”.</span></p>

actual export process when we’re ready to bring our first load of product to

The 
Impact / A Brand New Industry

Jamaica has a rare opportunity to export a commodity 
for the very first time. Jamaican 
Almonds, LLC is committed to the following aspects of pioneering this brand new 
industry:



	As stated in our Mission Statement, we are committed to maintaining the 
	manual process of the collection of almonds, thereby providing 
	long-term economic progress and sustainable employment for the farmers of 
	Jamaica.





	The Environmental Footprint of Jamaica is extremely important to 
	maintain through protection and ecological balance. One example of this is 
	to advise farmers to seed new crops according to recommended agricultural 
	methods that will discourage the utilization of “shakers” from being 
	implemented for the removal of nuts from trees. This process is used in 
	other industrialized countries, which involve mammoth sized vehicles with 
	“tweezer-like” claws that shake the nuts off the trees, thereby eliminating 
	the need for manual labor. Another example is when time approaches to plant 
	new tree seedlings for continuous and future crops, it is done with 
	environmental protection standards in mind and not resort to the less than 
	acceptable “orchard-style”planting, which wastes far too much land and 
	produces a lessor quality of almonds.






	From the beginning we have maintained the concept of “dotting every I 
	and crossing every T”, as we take the responsibility of pioneering this new 
	industry very seriously. We have included the most upstanding individuals in

The first and most important is cleaning up the environment by  phyto-remedaiting or bio-filtration of eutrophic water by using land based seaweed farms before it reaches the environment, or phyto-remediate a eutrophicated watershed before it grows and collectively creates ocean acidification.</p><p>Seaweed as a raw material can be used as a sustainable food supply. The raw materials of seaweed can be used for bio-plastic, bio-fuels and a myriad of other uses.</p><p>It was these two reasons for the driving forces that caused me to become dedicated into developing this new economic &amp; ecological paradigm that presently does not exist – yet!</p><p>We would like to use this technology to remediate-clean up more eutrophic sites as they come available through our seaweed consulting-remediation services/contracts/partnerships.</p><p><strong>Our Short Term Goal is;</strong></p><p>To realistically achieve these goals of remediating as many eutrophic sites as possible. Sea Plants Solutions presently has two sites to expand at and plenty of growing markets to fulfill BUT <strong><i>we do not have the  funding to bring these two pieces of the project together</i>.</strong></p><p><strong>We need funding to build the first THREE (Prototypes) 53’ modular SSTC-Systems </strong>to grow SIX of the NINE species grown by this method so far.</p><p><strong>In addition we also need the funding for the FIRST YEAR’S operational  costs.</strong></p><p>If we are able to achieve our goal these <strong>THREE 53’ Modulars will be able to collectively phyto-remediate roughly 110,000 gpd of eutrophic source water!</strong></p><p>We also seek funding for a small modular organic certified carrageenan lab using our proprietary method.</p><p><strong>Our long term goal is:</strong></p><p>To have sustainable prototypes and to be ready to pursue other locations while creating a new revenue sources.</p><ul><li><strong><span><span>We would like to create new sustainable economic and ecological paradigms from the SSTC-System.  This can be achieved by whether a SSTC-System is used as a modular integrated into a restricted site space or greenhouses for large remediation projects to clean the aquatic environments like estuaries, watersheds, lagoons, bays, marina's or larger bodies of water.</span></span></strong></li></ul><p><span><span>We hope people see the future as we do.  </span></span></p><p><strong>We want to start a “Seaweed Seed Stock Bank”</strong> for various other species that would be used in our seaweed consulting business of custom designs of SSTC-Systems to tackle any particular eutrophic - remediation job available, using species that are in commercial demand.</p><p><strong>The various sized turn-key modular SSTC-Systems would be furnished with a hybridized seed stock that would ensure full production &amp; remediating capabilities one month from set up time at any particular site.</strong></p><p>The Modular sizes we will work with will be 20’, 24’, 40’, &amp; 53’.</p><p>Since seaweed has different remediation, growth rates &amp; various affinities for different compounds. <strong>Generally speaking, a 20’ Modular SSTC-System can remediate at least 7,200 gallons-per-day eutrophic water and produce at least 1,000 pounds/month.  A 53’ Modular SSTC-System can remediate at least 24,000 gallons-per-day of eutrophic water and produce at least 2,400 pounds/month.</strong></p><p><strong>Some examples of sites that can utilize our SSTC-System are:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Aquaculture farms; - Land based &amp; floating fin-fish and shellfish farms and hatcheries-- both private and state operated facilities.</li>
<li>Hypoxia or acidification zones in eutrophic (concentrated nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Carbon Dioxide, which causes acidic conditions) watersheds, lagoons or bays compromised by a variety of industries &amp; agriculture found in those areas.</li>
<li>Re-circulated systems (aquaculture, polyculture/mariponics, aquariums; live seafood facilities).                                                                                                                                                    </li>
<li> Any remediation company that requires industry or agricultural clean up processes of affected sites.</li>

In 2009 to 2011 he put together and managed a 2,400 square foot greenhouse farm located on Sequim Bay, WA.  It was here that he started the first land based, sustainable sea vegetables farm for human consumption in the UnitedStates.                                                                                                                    </p><p>In 2009 Mr. Visi won Washington State’s Clallam County Entrepreneur Challenge Contest for the most innovative “green” business plan involving a SSTC-System farm using a large greenhouse. A $5,000 grant was the prize.  These funds were used to continue the research in the “Full Environmental Controlled” cultivation methodology of many other species of seaweed.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479478022/tgmborwiyyunzyngjhah.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Karaca</strong><strong>n Salkuci</strong> was born in Germany and is a multilingual person who has lived in the United    States since 1961.  She is a retired counselor, psychology teacher, retired faculty member of  several universities, research scientist, movement meditation instructor and is trained in animal psychology.</p><p>She has worked extensively with Tim Visi at developing the SSTC-System farm at the Sequim Bay, Washington location where she was directly involved with cultivar development, proprietary carrageenan extraction, protocol development and photographic documentation of the systems and processes.</p><p><strong><span><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></span></strong></p><ul>

<li><strong>The rest of the amount is for donation gifts &amp; our responsibilities to Indiegogo.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The breakdown of funding of the $610,000.00 are as follows;</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>$210,000.00 </strong>of this amount will allow us to re-fit/build three 53’ shipping containers to be turned into Modular SSTC-Systems.  Buy all the materials to build the specialized tanks that have been re-designed since the greenhouse; and equipment needed to build the system.  This includes the labor to build it; and the collection &amp; preparation of the seaweed biomass for production of six cultivars in six specialized tanks. </li>
<li> <strong>$25,000.00 for a 24' shipping container refurbished into a carrageenan lab.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong> $375,000.00</strong> <strong>for monthly operating costs for all three Modular’s for the first year</strong>.  By this time; we will be well on our way to attaining our goals. This will allow us to hire up to six people; who I will need to train as “Artisan Seaweed Growers” to operate the system &amp; maintain the biomass management in Modular SSTC-Systems.</li>
</ul><p>To re-start the entire detailed oriented process again; and reach full production level and remediation capabilities. We project it will take about ~ 9 months from initial start-up time to build the system.  Shortly after this; we can start pursuing more sites and associations with businesses that may wish to address their environmental impact on our waters.</p><p>It takes about 3 to 4 months to go through the Hybridization Period each plant of each species selected to grow to achieve the ""sustainable stage"" of the plants life cycle. </p><p>A Modular SSTC-System can be operated at a modest cost because it is a micro-cosm (synergistic environmental controlled growing system).

<p>Some folks might not have the economic ability to become monetary involved, but what I have found out over the years is that once people understand what I am trying to do they become active in their own way by reading on the internet or speaking to others.</p>
<p>Once we achieve the proper funding for the first three 53’ Modulars, we would be positioned to start expanding into other sites after the first year.  More sites mean more water that is cleaned; a chance to create an economic sustainability in areas where employment is scarce. </p>
<p>Sites for these Modular’s could be placed almost anywhere, be it rural or a metropolis. </p>

(www.seaplantssolutions.com).  I have been in the marine science field for about 28 years with 13 years as a NMFS Marine Fisheries Observer (domestic and foreign). Since 2002 I one of the handful of individuals in North America pioneering sustainable land based intensive seaweed cultivation systems-farms.I believe we all can make a difference in so many ways by offering alternative monetary gains for businesses as they actively clean up the environment. There are 50,000 proprietary products sold in the world today that require compounds that are found NOWHERE else in nature except seaweed.Over the last 10 yrs or so the US has been importing 200,000 metric tons of seaweed biomass to supply a thriving $2.5-Billion economy in this country.A few years ago I developed a land based seaweed system  from a large greenhouse that re-mediates or cleans up the environment.  I called this system a SSTC-Systems - (Synergistic Sustainable Tumble Culture-Systems)SSTC-Systems are proprietary land-based sustainable and fully environmental controlled. These seaweed growing systems produce high quality biomass for nutritious food & other high grade commodities. By aggressively phyto-remediating - or using plants to filter, eutrophic water – or water saturated with concentrated carbon dioxide, nitrogen and phosphorus, which is food for plants AND one of the “root causes” that impacts and creates widespread areas of eutrophication zones- otherwise known as ocean acidification.In 2013; SSTC-Systems were re-designed into more versatile configurations of modular SSTC-Systems refurbished from shipping containers, which is what this campaign is all about.Eutrophic water is concentrated with organic compounds like carbon dioxide, nitrogen & phosphorus and causes low oxygen concentration of the water and changes the natural water chemistry by causing pH to drop to an acidic condition.SSTC-Systems can reverse these  eutrophic – acidic conditions by phyto-remediating, removing or reducing this “eutrophic brew” as food while simultaneously increasing the oxygen concentration of the water and balancing the pH thereby returning the water chemistry back to normal. This happens 365 days/year without seasonal fluctuations as it is in nature.

We have, for almost a decade, grown sustainable commercial growing of 143-metric tons of seaweed on land.  Our research and development into phyto-remediation abilities of various species of seaweed has led to an understanding of how they can be used in various aquatic (freshwater, estuarine and saltwater) environments.
Our system has cleaned over 198-million gallons of eutrophic water from point source discharge (first above photo @ NOAA/NMFS Fisheries Research Lab in Manchester, WA) and 8-million gallons from no-point multi-discharge-eutrophic watershed and several micro-habitats (second above photo & below photos @ Sequim Bay, WA).
Our system can remediate-clean-remove thousands of gallons of eutrophic water from the environment on a daily basis; 365-days per year; while producing organic certifiable biomass.  This occurs with NO seasonal growth or remediation fluctuations as it would occur in nature.

This results in exemption status to all federal, state (our home in Washington) and county codes/regulations. Our website show the phyto-remediation capabilities of each tank. It also contains information on SGC Ratio (Seaweed Growth Co-efficient) of seaweed that addresses nutrients/seaweed biomass balancing for flow-through water circulation or re-circulated systems like mariponics.In 2009 I was joined by Karacan Salkuci whose decades of scientific research assisted in cultivar development, a method for carrageenan extraction and the development of essential protocols.This allowed me to finalize my research in 2011 into the development of a fully controlled growing system that added to and complimented the 2005 achievement of sustainable seaweed growing & harvesting techniques at Manchester, WA. In 2013 I re-designed the SSTC-System into a more versatile configuration by refurbishing used shipping containers into  Modular SSTC-Systems.  Even though they have a smaller footprint; they still can remediate several thousands of gallons of eutrophic water/day.Since seaweed has different remediation rates, growth rates and affinities for different nutrients. Generally speaking a 20’ Modular can remediate at least 7,200 gallons-per-day while a 53’ Modular can remediate at least 24,000 gallons per day -- 365-days/year!Our self contained modular systems can virtually be placed almost anywhere space is available to remediate a particular site and depending upon site specifics, can be used as an integrated system or stand-alone system.On May of 2013 Washington Fish Growers Associations (www.wfga.net) liked our SSTC-System design and published an article about Sea Plants Solutions on their website. In July 2013 my business proposal-using refurbished shipping containers into Modular SSTC-Systems and was accepted as one out of nine participants in the Bio-Marine International Aquaculture Entrepreneur Challenge in Nova Scotia.  Due to the lack of funding I had to unfortunately decline the invitation.Some Examples of  Sea Vegetables Grown by This MethodWe sustainably grew nine commercially important species with high growth rates (35% - 45% - depending on species).Briefly Describe Your Campaign and Why it's Important to YouI founded Sea Plants Solutions in 2012 for several important reasons. The first and most important is cleaning up the environment by  phyto-remedaiting or bio-filtration of eutrophic water by using land based seaweed farms before it reaches the environment, or phyto-remediate a eutrophicated watershed before it grows and collectively creates ocean acidification.Seaweed as a raw material can be used as a sustainable food supply. The raw materials of seaweed can be used for bio-plastic, bio-fuels and a myriad of other uses.It was these two reasons for the driving forces that caused me to become dedicated into developing this new economic & ecological paradigm that presently does not exist – yet!We would like to use this technology to remediate-clean up more eutrophic sites as they come available through our seaweed consulting-remediation services/contracts/partnerships.Our Short Term Goal is;To realistically achieve these goals of remediating as many eutrophic sites as possible. Sea Plants Solutions presently has two sites to expand at and plenty of growing markets to fulfill BUT we do not have the  funding to bring these two pieces of the project together.We need funding to build the first THREE (Prototypes) 53’ modular SSTC-Systems to grow SIX of the NINE species grown by this method so far.In addition we also need the funding for the FIRST YEAR’S operational  costs.If we are able to achieve our goal these THREE 53’ Modulars will be able to collectively phyto-remediate roughly 110,000 gpd of eutrophic source water!We also seek funding for a small modular organic certified carrageenan lab using our proprietary method.Our long term goal is:To have sustainable prototypes and to be ready to pursue other locations while creating a new revenue sources.We would like to create new sustainable economic and ecological paradigms from the SSTC-System.  This can be achieved by whether a SSTC-System is used as a modular integrated into a restricted site space or greenhouses for large remediation projects to clean the aquatic environments like estuaries, watersheds, lagoons, bays, marina's or larger bodies of water.We hope people see the future as we do.  We want to start a “Seaweed Seed Stock Bank” for various other species that would be used in our seaweed consulting business of custom designs of SSTC-Systems to tackle any particular eutrophic - remediation job available, using species that are in commercial demand.The various sized turn-key modular SSTC-Systems would be furnished with a hybridized seed stock that would ensure full production & remediating capabilities one month from set up time at any particular site.The Modular sizes we will work with will be 20’, 24’, 40’, & 53’.Since seaweed has different remediation, growth rates & various affinities for different compounds. Generally speaking, a 20’ Modular SSTC-System can remediate at least 7,200 gallons-per-day eutrophic water and produce at least 1,000 pounds/month.  A 53’ Modular SSTC-System can remediate at least 24,000 gallons-per-day of eutrophic water and produce at least 2,400 pounds/month.Some examples of sites that can utilize our SSTC-System are:
Aquaculture farms; - Land based & floating fin-fish and shellfish farms and hatcheries-- both private and state operated facilities.
Hypoxia or acidification zones in eutrophic (concentrated nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Carbon Dioxide, which causes acidic conditions) watersheds, lagoons or bays compromised by a variety of industries & agriculture found in those areas.
Re-circulated systems (aquaculture, polyculture/mariponics, aquariums; live seafood facilities).                                                                                                                                                    
 Any remediation company that requires industry or agricultural clean up processes of affected sites.
Any industry that produces greenhouse gases and organic waste streams.
About UsTim Visi’s career began in 1987 as a fisheries technician on a research project in the Bahamas involving ocean cage rearing of tilapia.  His next adventure took him to almost the other side of the world, to Seattle, WA to become a NMFS Marine Fisheries Biologist (Observer) for the next 12 years.                                                Starting in 2002 to 2008; Tim Visi became one of the few individuals in North America who pioneered intensive & sustainable land based seaweed systems.  He was asked to join a Sea Grant project at the (NOAA / NMFS) NW Fisheries Research Lab in Manchester, WA.  It was here that he eventually oversaw the project and proved from his research that seaweed could be grown sustainable and intensively while remediating aquaculture fish farm effluent or nutrient streams-- which if left untreated would eventually add to the eutrophication (acidification) of the environment.                                                                                        Here he grew an average of 23 metric tons per year on a 4,800  square foot farm while phyto-remediating 31.2 million gallons of finfish effluent per year.  In 2007; his research was critiqued by his peers at NOAA/NMFS.                                                                                                                                             He was also on the cover of the June 2007 Aquaculture Europe magazine and gave a short presentation to international aquaculture scientists visiting the Manchester NOAA/NMFS facility. From 2007 to 2008; he advised several Puget Sound bio-fuel companies on species selection and growing techniques of seaweed & marine microalgae (Diatoms) for various commodities derived from the biomass generated from such growing systems, as well as; growing strains/cultivar of marine microalgae.                                                                                                             In 2008, Tim Visi left NOAA/NMFS to continue the research & development on his own. In 2009 to 2011 he put together and managed a 2,400 square foot greenhouse farm located on Sequim Bay, WA.  It was here that he started the first land based, sustainable sea vegetables farm for human consumption in the UnitedStates.                                                                                                                    In 2009 Mr. Visi won Washington State’s Clallam County Entrepreneur Challenge Contest for the most innovative “green” business plan involving a SSTC-System farm using a large greenhouse. A $5,000 grant was the prize.  These funds were used to continue the research in the “Full Environmental Controlled” cultivation methodology of many other species of seaweed.Karacan Salkuci was born in Germany and is a multilingual person who has lived in the United    States since 1961.  She is a retired counselor, psychology teacher, retired faculty member of  several universities, research scientist, movement meditation instructor and is trained in animal psychology.She has worked extensively with Tim Visi at developing the SSTC-System farm at the Sequim Bay, Washington location where she was directly involved with cultivar development, proprietary carrageenan extraction, protocol development and photographic documentation of the systems and processes.What We Need & What You Get
The TOTAL amount we are asking for is $709,000.00
The amount we need is $610,000.00 
The rest of the amount is for donation gifts & our responsibilities to Indiegogo.
The breakdown of funding of the $610,000.00 are as follows;

$210,000.00 of this amount will allow us to re-fit/build three 53’ shipping containers to be turned into Modular SSTC-Systems.  Buy all the materials to build the specialized tanks that have been re-designed since the greenhouse; and equipment needed to build the system.  This includes the labor to build it; and the collection & preparation of the seaweed biomass for production of six cultivars in six specialized tanks. 
 $25,000.00 for a 24' shipping container refurbished into a carrageenan lab.


 $375,000.00 for monthly operating costs for all three Modular’s for the first year.  By this time; we will be well on our way to attaining our goals. This will allow us to hire up to six people; who I will need to train as “Artisan Seaweed Growers” to operate the system & maintain the biomass management in Modular SSTC-Systems.
To re-start the entire detailed oriented process again; and reach full production level and remediation capabilities. We project it will take about ~ 9 months from initial start-up time to build the system.  Shortly after this; we can start pursuing more sites and associations with businesses that may wish to address their environmental impact on our waters.It takes about 3 to 4 months to go through the Hybridization Period each plant of each species selected to grow to achieve the ""sustainable stage"" of the plants life cycle. A Modular SSTC-System can be operated at a modest cost because it is a micro-cosm (synergistic environmental controlled growing system). It is much easier and safer to harvest and maintain the land based SSTC-System than it would a system in the open ocean.The money we are asking for will help us continue where we left off back in Sequim Bay in 2011.IF we do not reach our goal; we can still make it work with smaller Modular; ALTHOUGH; IT WILL TAKE LONGER to reach our long term goal of establishing more sites as explained elswewhere in this campaign.As for What You GetWe are using a few interesting ideas we came up with, that we felt was unique and I hope people will like.We decided to use our new logo for our donation gifts.For higher-dollar donations we decided to create our own cast mold and design a medium size clear resin plaque/paperweight that will have a ""thank you"" in your name along with the kelp photo above and samples of the seaweed species we would be growing. The donation  breakdowns are as follows;

Donations for the $10 level will get a shout-out and thank you on our Sea Plants Solutions Facebook page.  It will be at our Facebook page where everyone would be able to see our updates & progress with the project too!

Donations for the $25 level; receives a Frisbee with this logo on it.

Donations for the $50 level; receives a sturdy Grocery Tote (colors to choose from) with  our logo.

Donations for the $80 level are ONLY for North America residents due to high worldwide shipping costs.  Donations at this level receives a 11 oz; Coffee Mug with this logo on it.     

Donations for the $100 level; receives a T-shirt (colors to choose from) with our logo.

Donations for the $200 level is offered ONLY to THIRTY people to participate in the seaweed collection with us; at a privately owned place to collect that is reachable ONLY by boat. Over the many years we have been at this; most of the time we have gone there to look and collect; we've had some awesome close up encounters with a variety of marine life.

Donations for the $250 level receives a seaweed cookbook, and a 6” X 9” clear resin plaque that will have a ""thank you"" in your name along with the kelp photo above  & samples of the seaweed species we would be growing.

Donations for the $500 level; receives ONE dried pound of organic-quality sea vegetables of your choice, a 6” X 9” clear resin plaque that will have a ""thank you"" in your name along with the kelp photo above  & samples of the seaweed species we would be growing, and a T-shirt with our logo on it.

Donations for the $1,000 level receives THREE dried pounds variety pack of 1/2 Lb samples of organic -quality sea vegetables we would be growing, a seaweed cookbook, a desktop resin plague with thanks in your name and the sea vegetables we are growing, and a T-shirt.

Donations for the $5,000 level; receives SIX dried one-pound packs of organic-quality sea vegetables, a desktop resin plague with thanks in your name and the sea vegetables we are growing, a seaweed medicinal book, a T-shirt, 11 ounce coffee mug, & a grocery tote bag; all with our logo on it.                      

The Impact
Obviously the greatest impact this project can have AND is the REASON why I kept at it all these years of waiting for the right time to launch this campaign is the reduction or reversal of ocean & estuarine acidification of the environment that we are presently witnessing.
We also accomplish an alternative way to create a responsible revenue source by helping to achieve multiply products; food and bio-energy.  There is no waste or negative impact from our system as all biomass is utilized and all water cleaned as it passes through our high growth tumble culture system.  We can achieve ZERO or negative carbon footprint by utilizing alternative energy sources like solar, wind powered generator. The seaweed can be used as feed stock for bio-ethanol & bio-methane. Other Ways You Can Help
Some folks might not have the economic ability to become monetary involved, but what I have found out over the years is that once people understand what I am trying to do they become active in their own way by reading on the internet or speaking to others.
Once we achieve the proper funding for the first three 53’ Modulars, we would be positioned to start expanding into other sites after the first year.  More sites mean more water that is cleaned; a chance to create an economic sustainability in areas where employment is scarce. 
Sites for these Modular’s could be placed almost anywhere, be it rural or a metropolis. 
It’s up to us (the people) to make the change towards a more sustainable economic & ecological paradigm.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

In 2015 ne-am unit cu Administratia Parcului Natural Apuseni sa incercam ceva diferit: sa atragem sprijinul tinerilor din Oradea, Cluj si Alba. Impreuna organizam PadisFest in august, un festival-campanie care va aduce concerte intre brazi si la Cetatile Ponorului, teatru pe stanci, arta culinara, tiroliana, escalada, concursuri de bicicleta, targ de produse traditionale si cate si mai cate. Vom avea dezbateri cu investitori, oameni din comunitati si turisti. 

Cu ajutorul vostru vom avea posibilitatea sa atragem cat mai multa atentie a presei pentru festivalul-campanie, sa oferim un exemplu de infrastructura turistica curata la festival si sa invitam niste artisti care sa va relaxeze intre brazi si sa va faca sa visati la o lume mai verde. 

Ce avem nevoieAvem nevoie de 2000 de euro pentru inchiriere de scena, plata artistilor, mobilizarea presei, inchirierea de toalete ecologice, asigurarea salubrizarii si promovarea dinamica a festivalului. Dintre acestia, vrem sa strangem 1000 din contributiile voastre, mana de la mana, iar 1000 din partea unor sponsori. Pe langa acesti bani, am castigat deja o finantare de 26110 lei de la Fundatia pentru Parteneriat Miercurea-Ciuc si MOL Romania prin programul Spatii Verzi, componenta Arii Naturale Protejate. 
Cum ne puteti ajuta?
Furnica - pentru 5 euro va daruim un zambet. Stim ca furnica duce graunte mari in spate, si furnica de la furnica construim un musuroi mare. 
Albina - pentru 10 euro va daruim o sacosa de panza PadisFest. Sa va transportati mierea cu ea.
Scoica - pentru 20 de euro va daruim o sacosa de panza PadisFest si va scriem numele in piatra, sa il gaseasca oamenii de stiinta peste sute de ani ca o scoica-fosila.
Fluturele - pentru 30 de euro va daruim o sacosa de panza PadisFest, va scriem numele in piatra si va daruim si un tricou PadisFest, sa zburati cu culorile Padisului  prin lume. 
Maimuta - pentru 50 de euro va daruim o sacosa, numele scris in piatra, un tricou si 5 intrari gratuite la tiroliana si escalada de la Padis in timpul festivalului.
Gorila - pentru 200 de euro va daruim o sacosa, numele scris in piatra, un tricou, o lampa frontala si 20 de intrari gratuite la viitorul parc de aventura Scorbura Motului pe Valea Ariesului.
Elefantul - pentru 500 va daruim o sacosa, numele scris in piatra, un tricou si un weekend surpriza in Muntii Apuseni. 

Impactul
 PadisFest 2015 e doar inceputul. Vrem sa organizam acest festival anual, sa crestem mari, iar in restul anului sa continuam campania pentru un turism responsabil in Padis. Primul target: sa cerem constuirea unui camping decent la Padis, pentru ca noi toti sa mergem in weekenduri cu placere acolo.

</p><p>Based on Environmental Protection
Agency estimates ,Tulsa County's population of 600,000 people will
produce approximately 12  million pounds  of electronic waste per
year. The EPA also estimates less than 30% of this of this gets
recycled. This means over 8 million pounds of ewaste are making it
into the landfills each year. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unacceptable. This is a waste
of recyclable resources as well as creating an environmental toxic
time bomb. Electronics are made of both easily recyclable materials
and substances that are toxic in the environment. It is essential for
future generations that this material gets diverted from landfills.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Electronic Synergy Foundation  (ESF) is
a non-profit (501c3) electronic recycling company. We were formed to
help combat this problem. Our mission is to leverage the recycling of
electronic waste (ewaste) for the community benefits of environmental
stewardship (keeping ewaste out of landfills) and charitable works
(donating usable electronics to other non-profit organizations).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We accomplish this by holding ewaste
collection events in Tulsa and surrounding areas. The way it works is
as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We choose a centralized location in the
targeted community (a park, shopping center, civic organization's
parking lot,) etc. We bring out a big truck (rental) and invite
donors to bring their unwanted electronics. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We load the donations onto the truck,
haul it to our warehouse, and sort through it.  As a general rule 90%
of what we receive has no use left (mostly old televisions). The
computers intended for re-use get refurbished (repairs + data
destruction). 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The unusable electronics get sorted and
aggregated into truckload quantities and sent to ECS Refining a
R2/E-Steward electronic recycling facility in Dallas Texas.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not charge recycling fees, as we
believe they are a barrier to recycling. We have heard ""I won't
pay to dispose of this TV, I'll just put it in a dumpster instead""
more times than we care to count.  Instead we fund ourselves through
donations of money and the revenue we generate from our recycling
efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What We Need</b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put it simply, we need money:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rental Trucks cost money, We've sought
sponsorships from the major truck rental companies, They were not
interested. On average it can cost $100 or more a day to use a rental
truck. (rental + mileage + fuel) 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event Insurance (average of $100 per
event) required by many venues</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wages:  It would be great if we had
volunteers to handle the workload of collecting and processing this
stuff, but while i'm waiting for them to volunteer, we need workers
willing to brave the weather and handle the load. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Infrastructure Support:  Warehouse
Rent, Pallets, Shrink-wrap, etc. all cost money.

<p>
</p><p>We will spend the money on holding
longer and more frequent collection events in Tulsa and surrounding
counties.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marketing (the more people know about
an event, the greater likelihood of participation) via radio in Tulsa
and mass mail marketing in the rural areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup collection sites and partnership
programs. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any leftover funds will be used to
upgrade our collection and processing infrastructure (ie:  purchase
forklift, truck, etc) 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that every dollar not
consumed by our collection efforts or overhead  will be used to
support our charitable works (donated electronics and IT support to
other non-profit organizations)</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What We've Done So Far</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean-out of a rural public school

<p>Our upcoming film, ""Adventure: Alaska,"" will show and teach kids about the popular places in Alaska and highlight the wildlife, nature, culture and adventure the state provides while showing the needs that Alaska has due to climate change. We as a team have realized how much kids really miss out by never being outside anymore, and how our world is disintegrating before kids even realize how beautiful it is. Our goal is to change kids' perspectives on what the world is going to look like in the future by showing them how they can help keep our world from dying now, we also want to show kids that they can be heroes too by showing them projects on our video blog that can help the environment.</p>

<p>In Summer of 2016, Miranda and Tanner will spend three months in Alaska filming all of their adventures while recording the facts about animal habitats and how we can help protect them and learn more about them, plus all the cool things that kids can enjoy outdoors. We hope that you will contribute to this cause in an effort to not only show kids and adults alike the greatness of the vast and amazing world beyond, but to pass on our passion to you and to them as well.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Join Us On Our Adventure</h3>
<p>All contributions will go toward camping gear and weather gear (living in Texas doesn't really require any cold gear) in addition to gas, food, safety supplies, additional film gear, tours/adventures, kayak and ATV rentals, lodging and campsites, in addition to a vehicle built for trails and road-tripping while still being as safe as we can. Our team will be working hard to meet this goal and we greatly appreciate your interest in this project and welcome you to our supporting family! </p>

We have a few perks to offer: our film production decal for your car (or really anything you'd like to stick it to), t-shirts with our </span>company<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> logo or our film title on them, donations to the Alaska Conservation Foundation, and an opportunity to be on location with us!</span></p>

</div>Independent film-making is becoming more and more popular, but filming documentaries, whether independent or not, is still not quite as popular to watch as we wish it was. We hope to help the world discover how great watching documentaries is and how much you can learn from them. Your contribution can help make this impact!<div>
<br/><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>No matter what this documentary is happening! In every leap of faith there is a risk of failure. If we don't raise up all of the money by summer 2016 then we will use the money to go up to Alaska and do more research then go in summer 2017.</p>
<p>My (Director) theory is that you only truly fail if you don't keep trying; the rest are just obstacles along the way. Yes, this endeavor is a leap of faith without the backing of a motion picture company but it is not impossible! <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I was raised by parents who believe in and fight for causes and do not back down in the face of challenges. My dad grew up in Alaska for a lot of his childhood and that was the beginning of my inspiration. My dad was a Marine, who fought in Desert Storm, turned police officer, 20 years and counting. My mom was a police officer turned counselor (yes, they met in the Police Academy and have been married ever since). So, I am stubborn, I do not quit even when my path gets tough, and I always hold true to my beliefs...because of my parents and others who helped me become who I am today. I am counting on these characteristics to overcome hurdles that gets in my way, from gear malfunction to weather to sheer mistakes!</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Call To Action!</h3> <p></p>
<p>Some of you can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Please spread the word about our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, E-mail, Instagram, etc. I appreciate any donations or publicity, even a ""good luck"" will go a long way! Thanks again! </p>

In Summer of 2016, Miranda and Tanner will spend three months in Alaska filming all of their adventures while recording the facts about animal habitats and how we can help protect them and learn more about them, plus all the cool things that kids can enjoy outdoors. We hope that you will contribute to this cause in an effort to not only show kids and adults alike the greatness of the vast and amazing world beyond, but to pass on our passion to you and to them as well.

Join Us On Our Adventure
All contributions will go toward camping gear and weather gear (living in Texas doesn't really require any cold gear) in addition to gas, food, safety supplies, additional film gear, tours/adventures, kayak and ATV rentals, lodging and campsites, in addition to a vehicle built for trails and road-tripping while still being as safe as we can. Our team will be working hard to meet this goal and we greatly appreciate your interest in this project and welcome you to our supporting family! 
                       So you might ask what you get for your contribution other than the knowledge that you are promoting a love of the outdoors in our current and future generations. We have a few perks to offer: our film production decal for your car (or really anything you'd like to stick it to), t-shirts with our company logo or our film title on them, donations to the Alaska Conservation Foundation, and an opportunity to be on location with us!


   
All donations are greatly appreciated and we thank everyone who has ever donated to Indiegogo, which provides people with amazing opportunities to reach their goals with your help. Thank you again for any support!
   The Impact 
Independent film-making is becoming more and more popular, but filming documentaries, whether independent or not, is still not quite as popular to watch as we wish it was. We hope to help the world discover how great watching documentaries is and how much you can learn from them. Your contribution can help make this impact!

Risks & Challenges

No matter what this documentary is happening! In every leap of faith there is a risk of failure. If we don't raise up all of the money by summer 2016 then we will use the money to go up to Alaska and do more research then go in summer 2017.
My (Director) theory is that you only truly fail if you don't keep trying; the rest are just obstacles along the way. Yes, this endeavor is a leap of faith without the backing of a motion picture company but it is not impossible! I was raised by parents who believe in and fight for causes and do not back down in the face of challenges. My dad grew up in Alaska for a lot of his childhood and that was the beginning of my inspiration. My dad was a Marine, who fought in Desert Storm, turned police officer, 20 years and counting. My mom was a police officer turned counselor (yes, they met in the Police Academy and have been married ever since). So, I am stubborn, I do not quit even when my path gets tough, and I always hold true to my beliefs...because of my parents and others who helped me become who I am today. I am counting on these characteristics to overcome hurdles that gets in my way, from gear malfunction to weather to sheer mistakes!   Call To Action! 
Some of you can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Please spread the word about our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, E-mail, Instagram, etc. I appreciate any donations or publicity, even a ""good luck"" will go a long way! Thanks again!

We’re not solving a bite-sized problem. We’re educating individuals on how doing business for the base of the pyramid is possible and how the world does not need another design of a solar lamp, rather distribution and financing for consumers in need. We are raising money to fund our pay-as-you go pilot including inventory purchase & warehousing, staff salaries, agent recruitment & training, in-country expansion, & some exciting BoP marketing campaigns.
There’s no reason that more people should lack electric light today than did before Edison invented the lightbulb 130 years ago. Affordable solar exists to let individuals leapfrog grid electricity, just as cell phones leapfrogged landlines in emerging markets. No longer are you waiting for telephone lines to be laid out for you house; no longer are you waiting for electricity lines to be laid out to your community. The power is in your hands. None this will happen without serious, dedicated work to providing creative distribution and financing tactics for those in need. The future is here; what will you make of it? EXTRASPerksIn addition to the impact you’ll be creating, we’re hoping to give you a taste of Nicaragua, too, with fun perks (hauled all the way from a market in Matagalpa, through the Miami airport for hours, lost in transit, found in Boston, and then driven across the country to San Francisco! Talk about a distribution challenge worth solving…)

 We aim to increase the deployment of solar energy through sharing good data and through communication. The Australian Solar Map is already a great resource for sharing information about the uptake of solar in Australia and is widely referenced in industry news. With your help we can do more...
We've got big plans for more from the Australian Solar Map including....



Mapping by electorate will help inform discussion and policy debate around support for solar. 


For most capital city CBD's it is already possible to map your rooftop for how much energy you can generate from solar panels using the Solar Potential Tool. We want to extend this to much greater areas.


We want to work with the Solar Schools program to include their data in the Australian Solar Map. 

We're interested in integrating weather data so that we can start to forecast future PV generation
and we are working with our members to develop new applications

This is only the beginning. We'd love to hear your ideas too. Join us in developing this amazing tool. 

    Who are we...?

The Australian PV Institute (APVI) is a not-for-profit, member-based association of companies, agencies, individuals and academics who are passionate about solar energy research, technology, manufacturing, systems, policies, programs and projects. 


Our objective is to: Support the increased development and use of PV via research, analysis and information. 

Participation in APVI activities is on the basis of subscriptions or sponsorship of research and events, like this one.  Benefits of membership include regular events and newsletters, networking, and the opportunity to meet and work with local and international PV experts on submissions, reports and research projects.
The Australian Solar Map was developed by the very clever Dr Anna Bruce, with the support of ARENA and a number of other APVI members.  
And we're very excited that the Australian Solar Map was nominated and has now been shortlisted for the Energy Globe Awards.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Short Summary Fins Attached believes that everything it does helps to protect the marine environment:  Fins Attached is a 501(c)(3) non-profit founded in 2010. Protection of the ocean's apex predators in critical for marine ecosystem balance. Your help will help to ensure the survival of this newly discovered Pacific sharpnose shark nursery.  The survival of the oceans means the survival of all living things on earth.   Project Needs The ability to track these juvenile sharks to maturity and consequently track them once they leave the nursery will be vital to their survival:  Phase one of the project will tag the sharks with internal acoustic transmitters. In order to monitor the sharks, underwater listening stations will be deployed to pick up the transmissions from the tags. Each tag costs approximately $400 and each listening station $1500. Discovering new shark nursery areas is a rare event. Now that it has been found, the key is to preserve it. Your funding will help create a no-take zone while these juvenile sharks are still around. Know the season will be important. Once the funding goal is reached the tags and listening stations will be purchased for deployment.    The Impact 
Conducting research, promote conservation, and providing education for the protection of the marine ecosystem is one of the most important things are generation can do. That is the mission of Fins Attached.
We believe in the preservation of our world's precious resources and that through the protection of the oceans apex predators, marine ecosystem balance can be maintained for the benefit of all living things on earth:

 Nothing is more valuable to the health of our environment than the health of our oceans. Become a part of the solution!
If these baby sharks are not protected, the fishermen will make them dissappear very quickly! Fins Attached and it's scientist and collaborators have a long history of over 20 years of conducting research and affecting change for the benefit of all humankind. Fins Attached is a 100% volunteer organization and as such all funds raised, 100% will be used to fund this project.    Risks & Challenges  When dealing with nature there are always challenges. However, our experience allows us to overcome many of these challenges. Dealing with governments to affect change is also challenging.  Fins Attached has a track record of convincing government to protect shark species, including at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Fins Attached is working with their field scientist, a Mexican native, on this project.

<p>We are a
waste oil recycling company, specialising in the collection and treatment of
waste oil products. We are set on changing the way people think about recycling
and waste products. People are becoming increasingly aware of the need to
recycle glass and paper products, but there is little known about the proper
treatment of waste oil. The shocking truth is that 1 gallon of waste oil can
contaminate 1 million gallons of water. Waste oil can be successfully recycled
and reused; by recycling waste oils we are able to drastically reduce the
carbon emissions and energy consumed to originally distil fuel.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431076095/qtykcmagjlyo8ilftej6.png"" src="""" style=""width: 380.495626822157px; height: 421px;""/></p>
<p>South
Africa generates 120 million litres of used motor oil each year. This used
motor oil is incredibly hazardous; it contains many toxic chemicals, including
cancer causing carcinogens. When disposed of incorrectly, this waste oil can
find its way into our water sources, polluting the natural environment and
leading to potentially lethal consequences for both human and animal life.</p>
<p>We
collect waste motor oil to recycle because waste oil isn’t worn out, it’s just
filthy. This used oil can be recycled and reused as fuel oil. By recycling and
reusing waste oil we are reducing the need for crude oil extraction
and the environmental ramifications associated with it. It takes
42 gallons of crude oil, but only 2 gallons of used oil to produce 1 gallon
of new, high quality lubricating oil.  By recycling just 2 gallons of used
oil, it is possible to generate enough electricity to run the average household
for almost 24 hours!</p>
<p>Another big collection source is waste oil from Marine
vessels. All big marine vessels run on a fuel called HFO which, in the
consumption process, results in a waste oil product called ‘sludge’. ‘Sludge’
is a dirty blend of emulsified oil and water. Marpol (the Maritime Pollution
Protocol) banned the discharge of sludge into the sea in 1983, which kept the
oceans cleaner, but resulted in landfills filling up quicker. Since sludge consists
of 50% oil, we realized that there was massive potential energy contained in
the product and began to acquire sludge from vessels. Once the oil is separated
from the water and cleaned of impurities, we are able to sell the resulting
product on as industrial heating fuel.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We have obtained all necessary
licenses and accreditation to operate our waste oil collection business and
have already seen ourselves making an impact within our community.</p>
<p>We reward our customers for
bringing in their waste oil for collection. By paying people for their waste
oil, we like to think we are helping people help themselves (financially) and
their communities (by having a cleaner community) as well as the greater
environment (by encouraging the concept of recycling and reusing, less harmful
waste oil is able to pollute our natural environment and find its way into our
water systems, preventing harm to humans and animals alike).</p>
<p>We need funding to aid in the
expansion of our business. This money will go towards building effluent plants
to treat the waste oil, social upliftment and educating communities.</p>
Reaching our funding goal will enable us to boost our corporate social responsibility program so we can keep on giving back to society and the environment. The nature of our business is based on recycling, the more successful our business is, the more we are aiding in environmental conservation. </div><div>Reaching our funding goal has the potential for incredible things, such as;</div><div>-Creating jobs and reducing the unemployment rate in South Africa</div><div>-Sending 1000 underprivileged children to school for a year</div><div>-Planting 5000 trees</div><div>-Cleaning up our beaches</div><div>-Supplying much needed grass lawns to underprivileged areas</div><div>-Putting a smile on the faces of thousands of children<br/><p><br/></p>

their face. The photo will have a location and the name of the child as well as
your name on it. Our aim is to make a wall of smiles, every 2500 strong smile-wall will be compiled and shared on our project Facebook page. Once each wall is done a digital copy will also be sent to the donor.  All smile walls will be kept on the Facebook page to track overall progress. For every Six smile walls, we will create one Smile Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame would be randomly named after one of its contributors. <br/></p>
<p><b>$10- Get involved at grass roots.</b></p>
<p>Help the children play. For every 100 Grass Roots perks taken up, we will
plant grass at a school or a park in a low income community in your honor . A plaque with all donor names and the location of the initiative will be put up at the site where it happens. A digital copy of the plaque will be sent to the donor.<br/></p>
<p><b>$50- Happy seas</b></p>
<p>Help keep our world beautiful. We

The project proposes to plant palm trees along both sides of Highway 1, as well as some additional trees at the island's entrance. The placement of the cabbage palms along Grand Isle's main thoroughfare will replace lost vegetation, create habitat for wildlife and make the island a more attractive place to live and visit. It will be a new signature feature of the island, serving as a visible sign of its recovery and rebirth for years to come.  

   What We Need to Succeed
 Our fundraising goal is $15,000, which covers the cost of purchasing 75 cabbage palm trees, 10- to 12-foot tall, as well as delivery and planting of the trees.
The trees will be planted this Spring so you will soon be able to see what a difference you have made in Grand Isle.   The Impact The palm trees will replace lost vegetation, create habitat for wildlife and beautify the landscape. Their resistance to wind and drought means that these trees will stand for years to come.

</h4>
<h4>
<b><br/></b><b>We will create a solar driven ""eSUN-TRIKE"" in 3 phases.<br/></b><b>• The first phase is to get our “feet on the ground“. This will be the simplest of all the steps as we have no current competition in Nicaragua at this time. </b>
</h4>
<h4>
<b><br/></b><b>The main brand in circulation in Central America and Nicaragua, was banned in Nicaragua. It is said that this was for technical reasons, due to vehicles catching fire. Since the ban, the vehicles in circulation are truly the ""last ones"" and as new ones of the banned brand are prohibited from entry, the used rickshaws are gaining heavily in value instead of losing value. <br/></b><b>This is making taxi rides for the country`s poorest ever more expensive. The competitor branded vehicles are few and far between, as they frequently overheat and have a bad reputation among buyers. <br/></b><b>The price of three wheel rickshaws in Nicaragua has shot up into unimaginable heights. 6-12 K (thousand) U.S. dollars is now a frequently asked price range for a USED Rickshaw in Nicaragua.   With prices rising, this situation is putting a lot of rickshaw drivers in the country out of work. It's a sellers market and this presents us with a good time to enter the market.<br/></b><b>It is a sellers market and therefore an opportune moment to enter.We have managed to obtain the import licence for our TRIKES  and believe that by using  a market penetrating strategy of significantly lower prices than the current ones, coupled with the fact that there is no competition, we are certain that our market entrance will succeed. Once having doing so, even in this first simple step, we calculate that we will have made profit margin of 500 USD per vehicle before taxes, while costing the buyers around one third of current prices. We plan to import one 40 foot container of normal gasoline- propelled semi-assembled three wheelers that will be delivered to the Chorintho port of Nicaragua.</b>
</h4>
<h4>
<b><br/></b><b>Once in Nicaragua, the vehicles will be assembled completely, (attachment of tyres, soft top, headlights as well as the unique paint job or “TIER DESIGN“ giving them their unmistakable look. <br/></b><b>A guarded company-owned strip of land (Approx. 500 square metres in Nindiri, near the Capital Managua, will be used as assembly and storage location of the then fully assembled vehicles.<br/></b><b>The sales personnel will receive (for Nicaraguan standards) extremely high commission payments for sales, motivating them to move swiftly and with iron determination. The sales of the vehicles should go quite fast and we forecast the import, assembly and sale of all 40-50 units to be completed in a total of three (3) months by focusing on B2B sales to established retailers. We will continue the import and sale of gasoline driven TRIKES until the mass production of the solar ""eSUN TRIKES"" is ready in Nicaragua.</b>
</h4>
<h4>
<b><br/></b><b>•  The second phase- is to use our now established “TIER - eSUN TRIKES“ brand in order to begin construction of an assembly plant directly in Nicaragua.<br/></b><b>This will enable us to apply for subsidies with the German “GIZ“(Gesellschaft fuer internationale Zusammenarbeit) or Society for international cooperation).  Germany and Nicaragua have excellent relations and Nicaragua is a main focus of their international development work. As long as the German mother (TIER KONZEPZ UG) holds the Nicaraguan subsidiary ( VM INVERSIONES Limitada ), we have excellent chances to receive the necessary machinery for full assembly from Germany, paid, or partly paid for by subsidies by the European Union and/or Germany. With the construction of the ""Nicaraguan Canal"" now already being under way and labour costs being the lowest on the continent, we believe that Nicaragua is the by far best place for construction and exportation of the ""eSUN-TRIKES. </b><b> This then completes the second phase.</b>
</h4>
<h4>
<b><br/></b><b>• The third phase brings us to the actual aim of this crowd- funding campaign. In this third phase, we begin the construction of our solar-propelled fully independently running three wheelers that will change the lives of many.</b>
</h4>
<h4>
<b><br/></b><b>As it is not yet technologically possible for the vehicle to be powered entirely by the energy produced by on board solar panels, we will solve the issue by selling ""HOME POWER STATIONS"" that are made up of large panels that come with five batteries and are delivered to the buyers home and set up by are staff. <br/></b>The user simply has to exchange the battery in the morning before using his taxi for work. The battery we shall be using for this, is patented (patent pending) and partly owned by our Director, Mr. John Maschewsky. With this battery in one hand and ever improving solar panel technology and our own engineers in the other, we aim to create the fully operational autonomous self-charging solar taxi in under two (2) years. That is a realistic time scale. Anyone who claims that it can be done faster, is either misinformed or just plain dishonest. The same can be said about those who claim the whole idea is just a ""dream"" and cannot be done.<br/><i>FACT: </i>According to ""SolarCity"", the newest panels were measured as having a 22.04% module-level efficiency by ""Renewable Energy Test Center"", a third-party certification provider.<br/>The new panels produce 30% to 40% more power over the current models, but they cost the same to manufacture -about .55 cents per watt, according to Bass. The panels, which are 1.61 meters or 1.81 meters in size, depending on the model, will have a capacity of 355 watts each.</h4>
<h4>
<br/>Back to the project. The German company ""TIER"" holds the trademark rights to date and will grant ""TIER NICARAGUA"" the licence to produce the TRIKES. The construction of the vehicles will then be handled by the subsiduary while the parts will be delivered by ""Motori Visconti  Ltd."" of Hong Kong. <br/>The gasoline version of our three wheelers has been tested extensively in the tropical climate of Bangladesh under the brand`s previous name of „Aurago“. After initial problems with overheating, we managed to solve all mechanical issues after our Team successfully redesigned the engine. It has been a huge effort and we have needed to set up a global network that we have been busy building over the past few years. </h4>
<h4>
<br/>-We are now set up to start, but we need your help.- </h4>
<h4>
<br/>Should our campaign succeed, we will deliver a new tool to the poorest people in the world. A three wheel rickshaw Mototaxi that can be put into charging mode while the driver waits for passengers and never needs to be charged or filled up with environmentally damaging fossil fuels. We will create jobs in Germany and Nicaragua, while enabling many others all across the third world to help themselves and get out of poverty by using our innovative product.<br/>The risk is that we fail to generate enough money through the sales of our gasoline driven three wheelers and therefore cannot set up the R&amp;D in the U.S. in time to meet our target of completing the Solar Taxi. It all depends. It depends on you.<br/>Please help us if you can and help make the TIER  ""eSUN-TRIKE"" available to people soon.  </h4>

<p></p>
<p><b>Unsere ""TIER eSUN-TRIKES"" haben das Ziel, die ärmsten Menschen dieser Welt dabei zu unterstützen sich selbst zu helfen, indem sie die weltweit ersten selbstaufladbaren Solar- Rikschas nutzen.</b></p>
<p><b>Wir sind bestrebt dieses Ziel, aufgeteilt in drei Phasen, innerhalb von zwei (2) Jahren zu erreichen und damit einen wichtigen Beitrag dazu zu leisten,  viele Menschen aus der Armut zu holen und zwar auf der Grundlage einer gewinnorientierten Unternehmung.</b></p>
<p><b>Aber was genau steckt hinter der Firma ""TIER""?</b></p>
<p><b>Unsere Firma ist ein Branding/ Marketing- und Vertriebsunternehmen mit Sitz in Berlin, Deutschland.</b></p>
<p><b>Wir haben bereits ein schnell wachsendes Netzwerk von Partnerunternehmen geschaffen, von denen jeder ein bestimmtes Produkt der Marke ""TIER"" in einem bestimmten Land vertreibt.</b></p>
<p><b>In den meisten Fällen konzipieren wir ein Projekt oder ein bestimmtes Produkt und suchen uns für die Herstellung einen Produzenten, der uns bzw. unseren Kunden beliefert.</b></p>
<p><b>Das Ziel dieser ""eSUN-TRIKES"" Kampagne ist es, ein voll funktionsfähiges, selbstladendes Solar-Dreirad Rikscha Fahrzeug zu fertigen.</b></p>
<p><b>Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, haben wir den folgenden Business-Plan unter folgendem Aspekt erstellt: </b></p>
<p><b>Wie können wir ein solarbetriebenes Fahrzeug ""eSUN-TRIKES"" erbauen und für unsere Kunden nutzbar und gewinnbringend herstellen ?</b></p>
<p><b>Zu Beginn ist Folgendes zu sagen:</b></p>
<p><b>Deutschland und Nicaragua haben ausgezeichnete Beziehungen und Nicaragua ist ein Schwerpunkt ihrer internationalen Entwicklungsarbeit. Solange die deutsche Muttergesellschaft die nicaraguanische Tochtergesellschaft hält, haben wir gute Chancen, die für den Zusammenbau notwendigen Maschinen mittels Kredite durch genannte Gesellschaften zu finanzieren. Ein Beispiel dafür ist die „GIZ“ (Gesellschaft für internationale Zusammenarbeit). Soweit notwendig,  ist es uns möglich Beihilfen über die „GIZ“ anzu-wenden. </b></p>
<p><b>1. Phase:</b></p>
<p><b>In der ersten Phase geht es darum, in den Markt einzutreten und unsere ""Füße auf dem Boden"" zu bekommen. Eine Marktanalyse haben wir bereits getätigt und dabei festgetellt, dass wir mittelfristig der einzig operierende Anbieter auf dem  nicarguanischen Markt sein werden. Der Vorteil hierbei ist, dass das System der Bevölkerung dort bereits bekannt und vertraut ist. Mit dem Bau des ""Nicaraguakanals"", der jetzt bereits in Gange ist und den niedrigsten Personalkosten auf dem Kontinent, glauben wir, dass Nicaragua der mit Abstand beste Ort für den Bau und den Export der""eSUN-TRIKES""ist.</b></p>
<p><b>Die Marke, welche derzeit in Mittelamerika überhaupt und in Nicaragua speziell am weitesten verbreitet ist, wurde in Nicaragua vor etwa einem halben Jahr verboten.</b></p>
<p><b>Es wurde angegeben, dass dies aufgrund vermehrter technischer Defekte geschah, da die Batterien der Fahrzeuge auffällig oft in Brand gerieten. </b></p>
<p><b>Seit dem Verbot, sind die Fahrzeuge, die sich noch im Umlauf befinden, wirklich die ""letzten ihrer Art"" die verfügbar sind. Da neue Modelle der verbotenen Marke von dem Import und der weiteren Marktteilnahme ausgeschlossen sind, werden die verwendeten Rikschas „symbolisch“ stark an Wert gewinnen. Letztenendes wird es aber zu einem Problem kommen, da z. B.  für erforderliche Reparaturen Ersatzteile nur schwer zu beschaffen sein werden. Dieses, auf Dauer durch den Ausfall der Fahrzeuge entstehende Vakuum werden wir durch unseren Markteintritt verändern.</b></p>
<p><b>Bis dahin aber werden  Taxifahrten für die Ärmsten im Land immer teurer. Die noch verbleibenden Anbieter anderer Marken Dreiradfahrzeuge sind dünn gesät und da diese Modelle anfällig sind, bsp. die Motoren häufig überhitzen, haben Sie bei den Fahrern derer einen schlechten Ruf. </b></p>
<p><b>Die Preise für dreirädrige Rikschas in Nicaragua sind mittlerweile in ungeahnte Höhen geschossen. 6.000 - 12.000 US-Dollar ist die häufig zu findene Preisspanne für ein gebrauchtes Rikscha in Nicaragua. Mit weiterhin steigenden Preisen wird diese Situation immer schwieriger. Es drückt die Rikscha-Fahrer in dem betreffenden Land aus der Arbeit, da es sich mit mehr lohnt, die Unternehmung profitabel zu führen, wenn die Anschaffungs-kosten für ein Fahrzeug immer höher werden. Es bringt die Leute zurück in die Armut, wenn ihnen dadurch die Lebensgrundlage zum Geldverdienen genommen wird. Dem wollen wir, unter Mithilfe dieser Kampagne, entgegenwirken.</b></p>
<p><b>Es ist ein Verkäufermarkt und daher ein günstiger Zeitpunkt um einzutreten. Folgende Kriterien ermutigen uns dazu: </b></p>
<p><b>Gültiger Besitz einer Einfuhrlizenz für die ""eSUN-TRIKES"" in Nicaragua</b></p>
<p><b>Durchdringen des Marktes mit der Strategie, hier durch deutlich niedrige Anschaffungskosten der Fahrzeuge</b></p>
<p><b>Ausschalten des Wettbewerbs mittels niedriger Preise, Innovation und Technologie</b></p>
<p><b>Nach unseren Berechnungen werden wir eine Gewinnmarge i. H. v. 500,00 US-Dollar pro Fahrzeug vor Steuern erzielen. </b></p>
<p><b>In Nicaragua eintreffend, werden die Fahrzeuge komplett montiert, d. h. Befestigung der Reifen, Softtop, Scheinwerfer, u.s.w.. Abgeschlossen wird der Prozess mit der einzigartigen Lackierung und dem Logo""TIER DESIGN"", mit dem sie ihnen ihren unverwechselbaren Look bekommen und im Strassenbild des Landes sofort auffallen.</b></p>
<p><b>Ein bewachtes, firmeneigenes Gelände (500 qm) in Nindiri, nahe der Hauptstadt Managua, wird vorerst als Montage- und Lagerungsort dienen, so dass dort die Endmontage vollzogen werden kann.</b></p>
<p><b>Parallel dazu werden wir mit Aufbau eines Vertriebssystems beginnen. Die Vertriebsmitarbeiter werden (für nicaraguanische Verhältnisse) sehr ansprechende Provisionszahlungen für den Verkauf erhalten, nicht zuletzt um sie zu motivieren, schnell und mit Entschlossenheit an den Verkauf der Fahrzeuge zu gehen. Der Verkauf der Fahrzeuge sollte in Anbetracht der geschilderten Marktsituation recht schnell vonstatten gehen und wir prognostizieren, dass die Einfuhr, die Montage und der Vertrieb aller 40-50-Einheiten in insgesamt drei (3) Monaten durch die Konzentration auf den B2B-Vertrieb mit Händlern abgeschlossen werden kann. Wir werden die Einfuhr und den Verkauf von benzin- angetriebenen Trikes, bis die Massenproduktion der solarbetriebenen ""eSUN-TRIKES"" bereit steht, weiterhin in Nicaragua, parallel dazu, betreiben. </b></p>
<p><b>2. Phase:</b></p>
<p><b>In der zweiten Phase werden unsere inzwischen etablierten Dreiräder mit der Solartechnologie ausgestattet. Dazu werden die Fahreuge mit den Solarpanels versehen und die Käufer der Fahrzeuge erhalten die notwendigen Batterien, unsere „HOME POWER-STATIONS“.</b></p>
<p><b>Da es technisch noch nicht möglich ist, Fahrzeuge vollständig durch die von Onboard-Solarzellen erzeugten Energie zu betreiben, werden wir das Problem durch die Verbindung von ""HOME POWERSTATIONS"" umgehen, die aus großen Panelen und 8 Batterien bestehen und mit dem Fahrzeugverkauf dem Kunden geliefert werden. Diese Speicher können problemlos im Hause unserer Kunden eingerichtet werden.</b></p>
<p><b>Der Benutzer muss lediglich die Batterie zu Beginn der Arbeit tauschen.</b></p>
<p><b>Die Batterie welche wir hierfuer verwenden, ist patentiertierte Technologie (Patent angemeldet), welche sich teilweise im Besitz von unserem Direktor, John Maschewsky befindet. Im Zusammenspiel mit diesem Akku in einer Hand und immer besserer Solar-Panel-Technologie in der anderen, unseren eigenen Ingenieuren und Architekten wollen wir das volle betriebsautonome Selbstladesolartaxi in weniger als zwei (2) Jahren erstellen. Das ist ein realistisches umsetzbares Zeitfenster. </b></p>
<p><b>Laut ""Solarcity"" schnitten die neuesten Solarpanele bei Tests hinsichtlich der Effizienz durch das anerkannte ""Renewable Energy Test Center"" 22,04% besser ab, als die zum Vergleich getesteten Vorgängermodelle.</b></p>
<p><b>Die neuen Platten erbringen 30% bis 40% mehr Leistung als die aktuellen Modelle, bei gleichen Anschaffungskosten. Die Platten sind 1,61 m oder 1,81 m groß und je nach Modell erbringen sie eine Leistung von bis zu 355 Watt.</b></p>
<p><b>3. Phase:</b></p>
<p><b>In der 3. Phase ist es das Ziel, die selbstladenden Solar-Dreirad Taxis oder""eSUN-TRIKES“ in Nicaragua zu produzieren und weltweit zu exportieren.</b></p>
<p><b>Das deutsche Unternehmen ""TIER“ hält die Markenrechte und gestattet der Tochterfirma ""TIER NICARAGUA"" die Dreiräder unter Lizenz herzustellen. Die Konstruktion der Fahrzeuge wird dann durch das Tochterunternehmen gehandhabt, während die Teile für den Zusammenbau von der ""Motori Visconti Ltd."" in Hongkong geliefert werden. </b></p>
<p><b>Die Benzin-Version unserer Dreiräder wurde ausgiebig im tropischen Klima von Bangladesch unter dem früheren Namen ""Aurago"" getestet. Nach anfänglichen Problemen mit Überhitzung der Motoren, gelang es uns, alle technischen Probleme zu lösen, indem unser damaliges Team den Motor erfolgreich überarbeitete. Es war ein großer Aufwand, doch es ist allen Beteiligten gelungen. </b></p>
<p><b>Sollte unsere Kampagne erfolgreich sein, werden wir den ärmsten Menschen der Welt ein neues Werkzeug liefern und zwar ohne die Umwelt zu belasten:</b></p>
<p><b>Das erste voll betriebsautonome Selbstladesolartaxi weltweit. </b></p>
<p><b>Bitte helfen Sie uns, wenn Sie helfen können, das TIER ""eSUN-TRIKE"" zu verwirklichen.</b></p>

Wir sind bestrebt dieses Ziel, aufgeteilt in drei Phasen, innerhalb von zwei (2) Jahren zu erreichen und damit einen wichtigen Beitrag dazu zu leisten,  viele Menschen aus der Armut zu holen und zwar auf der Grundlage einer gewinnorientierten Unternehmung.
Aber was genau steckt hinter der Firma ""TIER""?
Unsere Firma ist ein Branding/ Marketing- und Vertriebsunternehmen mit Sitz in Berlin, Deutschland.
Wir haben bereits ein schnell wachsendes Netzwerk von Partnerunternehmen geschaffen, von denen jeder ein bestimmtes Produkt der Marke ""TIER"" in einem bestimmten Land vertreibt.
In den meisten Fällen konzipieren wir ein Projekt oder ein bestimmtes Produkt und suchen uns für die Herstellung einen Produzenten, der uns bzw. unseren Kunden beliefert.
Das Ziel dieser ""eSUN-TRIKES"" Kampagne ist es, ein voll funktionsfähiges, selbstladendes Solar-Dreirad Rikscha Fahrzeug zu fertigen.
Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, haben wir den folgenden Business-Plan unter folgendem Aspekt erstellt: 
Wie können wir ein solarbetriebenes Fahrzeug ""eSUN-TRIKES"" erbauen und für unsere Kunden nutzbar und gewinnbringend herstellen ?
Zu Beginn ist Folgendes zu sagen:
Deutschland und Nicaragua haben ausgezeichnete Beziehungen und Nicaragua ist ein Schwerpunkt ihrer internationalen Entwicklungsarbeit. Solange die deutsche Muttergesellschaft die nicaraguanische Tochtergesellschaft hält, haben wir gute Chancen, die für den Zusammenbau notwendigen Maschinen mittels Kredite durch genannte Gesellschaften zu finanzieren. Ein Beispiel dafür ist die „GIZ“ (Gesellschaft für internationale Zusammenarbeit). Soweit notwendig,  ist es uns möglich Beihilfen über die „GIZ“ anzu-wenden. 
1. Phase:
In der ersten Phase geht es darum, in den Markt einzutreten und unsere ""Füße auf dem Boden"" zu bekommen. Eine Marktanalyse haben wir bereits getätigt und dabei festgetellt, dass wir mittelfristig der einzig operierende Anbieter auf dem  nicarguanischen Markt sein werden. Der Vorteil hierbei ist, dass das System der Bevölkerung dort bereits bekannt und vertraut ist. Mit dem Bau des ""Nicaraguakanals"", der jetzt bereits in Gange ist und den niedrigsten Personalkosten auf dem Kontinent, glauben wir, dass Nicaragua der mit Abstand beste Ort für den Bau und den Export der""eSUN-TRIKES""ist.
Die Marke, welche derzeit in Mittelamerika überhaupt und in Nicaragua speziell am weitesten verbreitet ist, wurde in Nicaragua vor etwa einem halben Jahr verboten.
Es wurde angegeben, dass dies aufgrund vermehrter technischer Defekte geschah, da die Batterien der Fahrzeuge auffällig oft in Brand gerieten. 
Seit dem Verbot, sind die Fahrzeuge, die sich noch im Umlauf befinden, wirklich die ""letzten ihrer Art"" die verfügbar sind. Da neue Modelle der verbotenen Marke von dem Import und der weiteren Marktteilnahme ausgeschlossen sind, werden die verwendeten Rikschas „symbolisch“ stark an Wert gewinnen. Letztenendes wird es aber zu einem Problem kommen, da z. B.  für erforderliche Reparaturen Ersatzteile nur schwer zu beschaffen sein werden. Dieses, auf Dauer durch den Ausfall der Fahrzeuge entstehende Vakuum werden wir durch unseren Markteintritt verändern.
Bis dahin aber werden  Taxifahrten für die Ärmsten im Land immer teurer. Die noch verbleibenden Anbieter anderer Marken Dreiradfahrzeuge sind dünn gesät und da diese Modelle anfällig sind, bsp. die Motoren häufig überhitzen, haben Sie bei den Fahrern derer einen schlechten Ruf. 
Die Preise für dreirädrige Rikschas in Nicaragua sind mittlerweile in ungeahnte Höhen geschossen. 6.000 - 12.000 US-Dollar ist die häufig zu findene Preisspanne für ein gebrauchtes Rikscha in Nicaragua. Mit weiterhin steigenden Preisen wird diese Situation immer schwieriger. Es drückt die Rikscha-Fahrer in dem betreffenden Land aus der Arbeit, da es sich mit mehr lohnt, die Unternehmung profitabel zu führen, wenn die Anschaffungs-kosten für ein Fahrzeug immer höher werden. Es bringt die Leute zurück in die Armut, wenn ihnen dadurch die Lebensgrundlage zum Geldverdienen genommen wird. Dem wollen wir, unter Mithilfe dieser Kampagne, entgegenwirken.
Es ist ein Verkäufermarkt und daher ein günstiger Zeitpunkt um einzutreten. Folgende Kriterien ermutigen uns dazu: 
Gültiger Besitz einer Einfuhrlizenz für die ""eSUN-TRIKES"" in Nicaragua
Durchdringen des Marktes mit der Strategie, hier durch deutlich niedrige Anschaffungskosten der Fahrzeuge
Ausschalten des Wettbewerbs mittels niedriger Preise, Innovation und Technologie
Nach unseren Berechnungen werden wir eine Gewinnmarge i. H. v. 500,00 US-Dollar pro Fahrzeug vor Steuern erzielen. 
In Nicaragua eintreffend, werden die Fahrzeuge komplett montiert, d. h. Befestigung der Reifen, Softtop, Scheinwerfer, u.s.w.. Abgeschlossen wird der Prozess mit der einzigartigen Lackierung und dem Logo""TIER DESIGN"", mit dem sie ihnen ihren unverwechselbaren Look bekommen und im Strassenbild des Landes sofort auffallen.
Ein bewachtes, firmeneigenes Gelände (500 qm) in Nindiri, nahe der Hauptstadt Managua, wird vorerst als Montage- und Lagerungsort dienen, so dass dort die Endmontage vollzogen werden kann.
Parallel dazu werden wir mit Aufbau eines Vertriebssystems beginnen. Die Vertriebsmitarbeiter werden (für nicaraguanische Verhältnisse) sehr ansprechende Provisionszahlungen für den Verkauf erhalten, nicht zuletzt um sie zu motivieren, schnell und mit Entschlossenheit an den Verkauf der Fahrzeuge zu gehen. Der Verkauf der Fahrzeuge sollte in Anbetracht der geschilderten Marktsituation recht schnell vonstatten gehen und wir prognostizieren, dass die Einfuhr, die Montage und der Vertrieb aller 40-50-Einheiten in insgesamt drei (3) Monaten durch die Konzentration auf den B2B-Vertrieb mit Händlern abgeschlossen werden kann. Wir werden die Einfuhr und den Verkauf von benzin- angetriebenen Trikes, bis die Massenproduktion der solarbetriebenen ""eSUN-TRIKES"" bereit steht, weiterhin in Nicaragua, parallel dazu, betreiben. 
2. Phase:
In der zweiten Phase werden unsere inzwischen etablierten Dreiräder mit der Solartechnologie ausgestattet. Dazu werden die Fahreuge mit den Solarpanels versehen und die Käufer der Fahrzeuge erhalten die notwendigen Batterien, unsere „HOME POWER-STATIONS“.
Da es technisch noch nicht möglich ist, Fahrzeuge vollständig durch die von Onboard-Solarzellen erzeugten Energie zu betreiben, werden wir das Problem durch die Verbindung von ""HOME POWERSTATIONS"" umgehen, die aus großen Panelen und 8 Batterien bestehen und mit dem Fahrzeugverkauf dem Kunden geliefert werden. Diese Speicher können problemlos im Hause unserer Kunden eingerichtet werden.
Der Benutzer muss lediglich die Batterie zu Beginn der Arbeit tauschen.
Die Batterie welche wir hierfuer verwenden, ist patentiertierte Technologie (Patent angemeldet), welche sich teilweise im Besitz von unserem Direktor, John Maschewsky befindet. Im Zusammenspiel mit diesem Akku in einer Hand und immer besserer Solar-Panel-Technologie in der anderen, unseren eigenen Ingenieuren und Architekten wollen wir das volle betriebsautonome Selbstladesolartaxi in weniger als zwei (2) Jahren erstellen. Das ist ein realistisches umsetzbares Zeitfenster. 
Laut ""Solarcity"" schnitten die neuesten Solarpanele bei Tests hinsichtlich der Effizienz durch das anerkannte ""Renewable Energy Test Center"" 22,04% besser ab, als die zum Vergleich getesteten Vorgängermodelle.
Die neuen Platten erbringen 30% bis 40% mehr Leistung als die aktuellen Modelle, bei gleichen Anschaffungskosten. Die Platten sind 1,61 m oder 1,81 m groß und je nach Modell erbringen sie eine Leistung von bis zu 355 Watt.
3. Phase:
In der 3. Phase ist es das Ziel, die selbstladenden Solar-Dreirad Taxis oder""eSUN-TRIKES“ in Nicaragua zu produzieren und weltweit zu exportieren.
Das deutsche Unternehmen ""TIER“ hält die Markenrechte und gestattet der Tochterfirma ""TIER NICARAGUA"" die Dreiräder unter Lizenz herzustellen. Die Konstruktion der Fahrzeuge wird dann durch das Tochterunternehmen gehandhabt, während die Teile für den Zusammenbau von der ""Motori Visconti Ltd."" in Hongkong geliefert werden. 
Die Benzin-Version unserer Dreiräder wurde ausgiebig im tropischen Klima von Bangladesch unter dem früheren Namen ""Aurago"" getestet. Nach anfänglichen Problemen mit Überhitzung der Motoren, gelang es uns, alle technischen Probleme zu lösen, indem unser damaliges Team den Motor erfolgreich überarbeitete. Es war ein großer Aufwand, doch es ist allen Beteiligten gelungen. 
Sollte unsere Kampagne erfolgreich sein, werden wir den ärmsten Menschen der Welt ein neues Werkzeug liefern und zwar ohne die Umwelt zu belasten:
Das erste voll betriebsautonome Selbstladesolartaxi weltweit. 
Bitte helfen Sie uns, wenn Sie helfen können, das TIER ""eSUN-TRIKE"" zu verwirklichen.

<div><ul>
<li>Huge cost savings on electricity</li>
<li>Create a greener future for our planet</li>
<li>Utilizes a free, safe, clean, renewable resource</li>
<li>A conscious business with a conscience</li>
</ul></div>
<div>We have the solution to maximizing efficiency in creating solar power. Our <b>commercial dual axis tracking frame</b> is the only roof top tracking frame that will be commercially available in North America.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In contrast to existing fixed frame systems, <b>Energycostsaver Inc.'s</b> solar solutions<b> </b>has a unique moving frame that tracks and maximizes the sun's energy throughout the day and seasonally so that the solar panels are always facing the Sun. This means 40% more efficiency than fixed solar panels. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are now ready to take the next step to commercialize our system and are looking for like-minded people to assist.<br/>
</div>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>The Opportunity</b></h2>
<p>Besides reducing carbon emissions and realizing tremendous financial savings, solar energy is a clean, reliable power with little maintenance and is a free resource/fuel.  Solar energy could conceivably represent 20% of the new electricity supplied in the next 20 years in Canada.  Ten megawatts supplied by a solar farm could service 2500 to 3000 homes but requires 4 to 5 acres of land per megawatt to produce.  </p>
<p>There are three primary markets for which our systems will be ideally suited:  </p>
<p>1. Flat roofs found on most warehouses, schools, shopping centres, auto dealerships and big box stores;</p>
<p>2. Solar farms on or off-the-grid, to service First Nation Reserves, northern oil installations and large farming operations;</p>
<p>3. Mobile systems for temporary locations, small farms and acreages.</p>
<p>We are working with First Nations communities to assist in the assembly and installation of our first solar system in Alberta.  Our system will be able to employ trainees from all education and skill levels, and some who may be otherwise unemployable.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Alderville First Nations Solar Farm </b>is the first to be developed and owned by a First Nations community. Typical of new and innovative technologies, there was a steep learning curve and many obstacles to be overcome. The issues were resolved and <b>Chief Marsden</b> is very happy with the result and has been kind enough to offer to share information with us. The Alderville First Nations Solar Farm was a huge undertaking and demonstrates the vision of the Chief and Council who have created a legacy that will benefit their people for generations to come.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We currently have <b>letters of intent </b>from several First Nation communities in Alberta to install solar fields on their tribal lands.  Our agreement calls for the training and the active involvement of First Nations in the assembly and installation of the solar fields.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are requesting $35,000 CDN to complete our <b>commercial dual axis tracking frame</b> patent application, to copyright our trade mark and have a prototype built for testing prior to large scale manufacturing.  </p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Why Support Us?

Huge cost savings on electricity
Create a greener future for our planet
Utilizes a free, safe, clean, renewable resource
A conscious business with a conscience

We have the solution to maximizing efficiency in creating solar power. Our commercial dual axis tracking frame is the only roof top tracking frame that will be commercially available in North America.  

In contrast to existing fixed frame systems, Energycostsaver Inc.'s solar solutions has a unique moving frame that tracks and maximizes the sun's energy throughout the day and seasonally so that the solar panels are always facing the Sun. This means 40% more efficiency than fixed solar panels. 

We are now ready to take the next step to commercialize our system and are looking for like-minded people to assist.




The Opportunity
Besides reducing carbon emissions and realizing tremendous financial savings, solar energy is a clean, reliable power with little maintenance and is a free resource/fuel.  Solar energy could conceivably represent 20% of the new electricity supplied in the next 20 years in Canada.  Ten megawatts supplied by a solar farm could service 2500 to 3000 homes but requires 4 to 5 acres of land per megawatt to produce.  
There are three primary markets for which our systems will be ideally suited:  
1. Flat roofs found on most warehouses, schools, shopping centres, auto dealerships and big box stores;
2. Solar farms on or off-the-grid, to service First Nation Reserves, northern oil installations and large farming operations;
3. Mobile systems for temporary locations, small farms and acreages.
We are working with First Nations communities to assist in the assembly and installation of our first solar system in Alberta.  Our system will be able to employ trainees from all education and skill levels, and some who may be otherwise unemployable.  

The Alderville First Nations Solar Farm is the first to be developed and owned by a First Nations community. Typical of new and innovative technologies, there was a steep learning curve and many obstacles to be overcome. The issues were resolved and Chief Marsden is very happy with the result and has been kind enough to offer to share information with us. The Alderville First Nations Solar Farm was a huge undertaking and demonstrates the vision of the Chief and Council who have created a legacy that will benefit their people for generations to come.

We currently have letters of intent from several First Nation communities in Alberta to install solar fields on their tribal lands.  Our agreement calls for the training and the active involvement of First Nations in the assembly and installation of the solar fields.
   What We Need & What You Get We are requesting $35,000 CDN to complete our commercial dual axis tracking frame patent application, to copyright our trade mark and have a prototype built for testing prior to large scale manufacturing.  

In exchange for every $25, $50 or $100 you generously donate, you will receive an Energycostsaver Inc. Preferred Share certificate which will bear interest at 5% with principal and interest repayable in two years from the date of the successful raising of the required funds.

    The Impact The Green Revolution has just started and we, and our partners, will be in the forefront with innovative solar solutions.

Over 50% of Alberta's electricity is generated from coal fired power plants, all of which are being phased out.  All of the new plants to be built in Alberta will be using natural gas. Alberta's power generation is at capacity and unable to meet the expected doubling of demand over the next 20 years.  To meet demand, billions of dollars will need to be spent on new power generation, resulting in huge increases in the cost of electricity.  Our commercial dual axis solar tracking system will mitigate this essential and costly operating expense.  Our system will provide lower power bills and eliminate any future rate increases.
Solar power is the perfect Private/Public Partnership vehicle, providing tax incentives and long-term stable income for investors, and low cost power for the user.  Governments have thousands of roof tops that could be used to generate electricity at no cost to the government, and give investors attractive investment returns.


    Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to support Energycostsaver Inc. financially, please know that you can help us in other ways too.  Please share information about our desire to develop practical solar solutions that harness the sun's power in a clean environmental manner as well as helping to train and employ communities to support their own energy needs.

<p>The
environmental and climate crisis has been an increasingly constant concern
in many places around the world. From the young and elderly, women and
men, to institutions, companies and governments, all have expressed concern
about the environmental costs that have been provoked due to unrestrained
economic growth and rampant consumption.</p>
<p></p>In
this reality the United Nations proposed a new economic model, the “<a href=""http://www.greenup-unep.org/green-economy/what-is-green-economy.htm?lng=en#.V0x-DaPLfbw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Green Economy</a>”, beginning in the 1990s. The plan was designed to assist governments
in ""greening"" their economies by reshaping and refocusing policies,
investments and spending towards an emerging range of sectors. These areas
include “clean” technologies, renewable energies, hydroelectric dams, wind
farms, renewed water services, green transportation, eco friendly waste
management, building green cities, agriculture and promoting sustainable
forests.<br/><p></p>

<p></p>On the other hand, there are a plurality of original peoples, indigenous and
farmworkers, in many parts of the world who believe in other world views, and
whose connection with nature and the land has been historic and
constant. Yet over the course of the last two or even three decades,
specifically in Latin America, these indigenous peoples have been displaced or
evicted from their ancestral lands to make way for megaprojects under the guise
of ‘sustainable development and conservation of the environment. In many cases,
these people have been criminalized, even charged under anti-terror laws, as
they seek to have a voice and resist this particular kind of “development”. In
Latin America rate of murders of environmental activists, mostly indigenous,
have increased. These individuals have struggled to stop clean energy
megaprojects, industrial agriculture, deforestation, mining, among others. murders
of activists.

link between the Green Economy and human rights violations against indigenous
peoples, farmworkers, minorities, small-scalle producers, and placing emphasis
on the role of women.</p>

</p>
<p>The
book will be made available in print as well as in a digital format. The
electronic version will be accompanied by an interactive and dynamic map, which
will allow for the user to locate in each of the countries and regions of
Mexico and Central America, the major projects of the Green Economy model. The
map will also provide visual and textual elements that identify and locate the
major transnational companies as well as their financing, and the groups of

<p>La crisis ambiental y climática ha sido una preocupación constate en

<p>Es en ese sentido que, las Naciones Unidas
propusieron un nuevo modelo económico, la Economía Verde, cuya implementación
fue intensificada desde la década de 1990, diseñada para asistir a los
gobiernos en el ""reverdecimiento"" de sus economías mediante la
reestructuración y la reorientación de sus políticas, inversiones y gastos
hacia una gama de sectores, tales como las tecnologías limpias, las energías renovables,
como hidreletricas y parques eólicos, los servicios de agua, el transporte
verde, el tratamiento de los desechos, la edificación de ciudades verdes y la
agricultura, los bosques sostenibles

<p>Por otra parte, están los pueblos,
principalmente indígenas y campesinos, quienes desde siempre han tenido un
vinculo espiritual con la naturaleza. Pero desde las últimas dos décadas, principalmente
en países de Latinoamérica, han sido desplazados de sus territorios ancestrales
para dar paso a los megaproyectos de Desarrollo Sustentable o en nombre de la
conservación de la naturaleza. En muchos casos, se les ha criminalizado hasta
con leyes antiterroristas por intentar detener este tipo de desarrollo. En
Latinoamérica ha aumentado el índice de asesinatos de activistas ambientales,
en su mayoría indígenas, que han luchado por detener megaproyectos de energías
limpias, la agricultura industrial, la deforestación, la minería, entre otros. <br/></p>

<span>§<span>  </span></span>Mapas y documentos</li></ul>
<h4>Esta material estará libre para las
comunidades indígenas y campesinas, organizaciones no gubernamentales sin fines
de lucro, así como para medios libres e independientes. </h4>
<p>2. Producción de un libro-reportaje a
partir de investigaciones y de entrevistas hechas en el recorrido, con el
objetivo de relacionar la economía verde y las violaciones de derechos humanos
hacia los pueblos indígenas, campesinos, negros, pescadores artesanales, con
especial atención al papel de las mujeres.</p>
<p>Este libro será impreso y producido en
un formato multimedia. La versión electrónica será acompañada por un mapa
interactivo y dinámico, que permita ubicar en cada uno de los países de México
y Centroamérica los principales proyectos de este modelo de economía verde. </p>
<p>Así mismo, en dicho mapa podremos
ubicar el nombre de las empresas y las principales líneas transnacionales de
financiamiento. Ubicaremos los principales pueblos indígenas o campesinos que
están siendo afectados y, geográficamente, podemos identificar los lugares a
donde han sido asesinados los activistas ambientales y lideres indígenas. </p>
<p>Nuestro compromiso es profundizar la
investigación y llegar a los lugares donde los medios comerciales o masivos no
llegan.</p>

The
environmental and climate crisis has been an increasingly constant concern
in many places around the world. From the young and elderly, women and
men, to institutions, companies and governments, all have expressed concern
about the environmental costs that have been provoked due to unrestrained
economic growth and rampant consumption.
In
this reality the United Nations proposed a new economic model, the “Green Economy”, beginning in the 1990s. The plan was designed to assist governments
in ""greening"" their economies by reshaping and refocusing policies,
investments and spending towards an emerging range of sectors. These areas
include “clean” technologies, renewable energies, hydroelectric dams, wind
farms, renewed water services, green transportation, eco friendly waste
management, building green cities, agriculture and promoting sustainable
forests.

On the other hand, there are a plurality of original peoples, indigenous and
farmworkers, in many parts of the world who believe in other world views, and
whose connection with nature and the land has been historic and
constant. Yet over the course of the last two or even three decades,
specifically in Latin America, these indigenous peoples have been displaced or
evicted from their ancestral lands to make way for megaprojects under the guise
of ‘sustainable development and conservation of the environment. In many cases,
these people have been criminalized, even charged under anti-terror laws, as
they seek to have a voice and resist this particular kind of “development”. In
Latin America rate of murders of environmental activists, mostly indigenous,
have increased. These individuals have struggled to stop clean energy
megaprojects, industrial agriculture, deforestation, mining, among others. murders
of activists.




Many
of the people being killed in these struggles are not only protecting their
local land and water. By keeping carbon in the ground, and defending ecological
farming practices, they are showing the rest of us how to prevent catastrophic
climate change.

Our
project is to rigorously investigate the real impact of this new model of the
Green Economy. Likewise, we seek to expose different alternatives that are
being created from below in response to environmental and the climate change
crisis.





Goals:


1. Creating a Green Economy watch dog organization, essentially a website or
digital platform where the following materials will document and make public
the relationship between the Green Economy and Human Rights violations:
 Interviews, expert analysis, articles and reports made during the period in
which we will tour and document Mexico-Central America
 
Multimedia, Photographs, video reports

Maps and documents

This material will be directed towards and made free and accessible for
the indigenous and farmworking communities, their leadership organizations,
NGOs, non-profits and independent media.



2.
Production and final publication of a book-report derived from research and
interviews conducted in the course of the trip, with the aim of observing the
link between the Green Economy and human rights violations against indigenous
peoples, farmworkers, minorities, small-scalle producers, and placing emphasis
on the role of women.


The
book will be made available in print as well as in a digital format. The
electronic version will be accompanied by an interactive and dynamic map, which
will allow for the user to locate in each of the countries and regions of
Mexico and Central America, the major projects of the Green Economy model. The
map will also provide visual and textual elements that identify and locate the
major transnational companies as well as their financing, and the groups of
people who are directly and indirectly negatively impacted by the actions of
these companies.
Our commitment is to deepen our research and reach the
places where the commercial or mass media fail to reach.

We
kindly request that you be part of this project, give it a push, and support
not only independent and ethical journalism, but to better our understanding of
the dramatic changes to our environment, the people most affected, and to
emphasize ground-up democratic solutions.

La crisis ambiental y climática ha sido una preocupación constate en
las diversas geografías del planeta. Desde jóvenes y ancianos, mujeres y hombres,
hasta instituciones, empresas y gobiernos han mostrado su preocupación sobre
los costos ambientales que ha provocado el crecimiento económico y el consumo
desenfrenado.  
Es en ese sentido que, las Naciones Unidas
propusieron un nuevo modelo económico, la Economía Verde, cuya implementación
fue intensificada desde la década de 1990, diseñada para asistir a los
gobiernos en el ""reverdecimiento"" de sus economías mediante la
reestructuración y la reorientación de sus políticas, inversiones y gastos
hacia una gama de sectores, tales como las tecnologías limpias, las energías renovables,
como hidreletricas y parques eólicos, los servicios de agua, el transporte
verde, el tratamiento de los desechos, la edificación de ciudades verdes y la
agricultura, los bosques sostenibles
 y las redes de Áreas Protegidas para venta de creditos de carbono -también conocidos como permisos de contaminación.  


Por otra parte, están los pueblos,
principalmente indígenas y campesinos, quienes desde siempre han tenido un
vinculo espiritual con la naturaleza. Pero desde las últimas dos décadas, principalmente
en países de Latinoamérica, han sido desplazados de sus territorios ancestrales
para dar paso a los megaproyectos de Desarrollo Sustentable o en nombre de la
conservación de la naturaleza. En muchos casos, se les ha criminalizado hasta
con leyes antiterroristas por intentar detener este tipo de desarrollo. En
Latinoamérica ha aumentado el índice de asesinatos de activistas ambientales,
en su mayoría indígenas, que han luchado por detener megaproyectos de energías
limpias, la agricultura industrial, la deforestación, la minería, entre otros. 


Muchos de los muertos en estas luchas no
sólo han protegido su tierra ancestral y el agua. Al mantener el carbono en el
suelo y defender las prácticas de agricultura ecológica han mostrado al resto
del planeta una alternativa real y concreta para contrarrestar la catástrofe
climática, la cual ya se ha comenzado agudizar en diversas geografías.
Nuestro siguiente proyecto consiste en
investigar con rigurosidad el impacto real de este nuevo modelo de economía
verde. Así mismo, buscamos retomar otras alternativas como respuesta a la
crisis ambiental y climática. 

Pedimos que seas parte de este
proyecto, con tus donaciones podremos realizar parte del viaje a México y Centroamérica.
En este recorrido visitaremos los principales lugares afectados y
criminalizados.

Objetivos:


1. Creación de un Observatorio de la
Economía Verde, una plataforma web donde se concentrarán los siguientes materiales
que evidenciarán las relaciones entre Economía Verde y violaciones de Derechos
Humanos:

§  Entrevistas, análisis, artículos y reportajes realizados durante
el recorrido por México-Centroamérica

§  Videos y foto-galería

§  Mapas y documentos
Esta material estará libre para las
comunidades indígenas y campesinas, organizaciones no gubernamentales sin fines
de lucro, así como para medios libres e independientes. 
2. Producción de un libro-reportaje a
partir de investigaciones y de entrevistas hechas en el recorrido, con el
objetivo de relacionar la economía verde y las violaciones de derechos humanos
hacia los pueblos indígenas, campesinos, negros, pescadores artesanales, con
especial atención al papel de las mujeres.
Este libro será impreso y producido en
un formato multimedia. La versión electrónica será acompañada por un mapa
interactivo y dinámico, que permita ubicar en cada uno de los países de México
y Centroamérica los principales proyectos de este modelo de economía verde. 
Así mismo, en dicho mapa podremos
ubicar el nombre de las empresas y las principales líneas transnacionales de
financiamiento. Ubicaremos los principales pueblos indígenas o campesinos que
están siendo afectados y, geográficamente, podemos identificar los lugares a
donde han sido asesinados los activistas ambientales y lideres indígenas. 
Nuestro compromiso es profundizar la
investigación y llegar a los lugares donde los medios comerciales o masivos no
llegan.

<p>Tell your Mom you love her by saving a butterfly</p>
<p><br/>Pelee Island Bird Observatory (PIBO) is raising $1000 to plant milkweed and indigenous wildflowers for nectar on its land on Pelee Island. These funds will create habitat for Monarchs to feed and or lay their eggs as they start the annual migration to Mexico.</p>
<p><br/>Surplus funds will be applied to PIBO's educational outreach program to students in Essex County/Windsor area.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Work plan:</strong>  (1) Providing a quality habitat for Monarch Butterflies by planting and maintaining various species of Milkweed and other nectar plants for all life stages of the Monarch.  (2) To educate others about the threats to Monarch butterflies and possibly to connect with the Monarch Trail in Leamington. (3) By growing wildflowers that are carefully selected to match Pelee Island’s unique ecosystem, we hope to provide a healthy stop over site for the Monarchs to rest and refuel for their flight over Lake Erie.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Benefits</strong>: A long-term healthy habitat with a variety of native plant species means that Monarch Butterflies will be supported in all their life stages.  Through this program, we will educate others about the threats to Monarch butterflies and possibly to connect with the Monarch Trail in Leamington to create a connection between the mainland and the island. By growing wildflowers that are carefully selected to match Pelee Island’s unique ecosystem, we hope to provide a healthy stop over site for the Monarchs to rest and refuel to continue their migration over Lake Erie. Of course, not only Monarch butterflies will benefit from our efforts, but also other species of butterflies that rely on native plants will also find refuge.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Why us and what we can do?</strong> PIBO owns a small piece of property on McCormick Road on Pelee Island. Zoned agricultural, it can be used for conservation purposes and public use. Originally intended for an educational centre/staff housing, the plot is an ideal spot for a conservation initiative such as a Monarch Butterfly garden, as it is located adjacent to Fish Point Nature Reserve, a designated IBA (Important Bird Area) location.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Who we are:</strong> Pelee Island Bird Observatory is a non-profit charitable organisation devoted to the study and conservation of birds. Our mandate includes long-term migration monitoring as a member of the Canadian Migration Monitoring Network; long –term studies of Pelee’s breeding bird communities; to serve as an educational centre for the public and local schools and to highlight the importance of Pelee’s unique natural heritage. It is because of this last point that this new initiative was formed.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Why Monarchs?</strong> Each fall, North American Monarchs travel from their summer breeding grounds to overwintering locations travelling between 2-5,000 kms. Monarchs, like other butterflies and moths, undergo complete metamorphosis, meaning they have an egg, larva, pupa and adult stage. The egg and caterpillar stages occur only on species of milkweed (genus Asclepias) whereas adults survive by drawing nectar from a variety of flowering plants. As is the case with migratory birds, monarchs use Pelee Island as a stopover site. Moreover, the staff of PIBO have been conducting a Monarch migration count for over a decade. As with the general trend elsewhere, we have noticed a considerable reduction in their numbers over the years.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Threats to Monarchs:</strong> The major risks in Canada include: The use of pesticides and herbicides; the loss of native plant species; the propagation of non-native plant species and the escape of these species into natural areas; Development, mainly urban sprawl; Damage to Milkweed from ground level ozone (smog) and drought. (David Suzuki Foundation)</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Site Preparation:</strong> Recently a flora and fauna survey was performed on the site, and unfortunately some invasive species were discovered. Phragmites, garlic mustard and English ivy were found growing in the plot. These invasive species will need to be removed as soon as possible.

Pelee Island Bird Observatory (PIBO) is raising $1000 to plant milkweed and indigenous wildflowers for nectar on its land on Pelee Island. These funds will create habitat for Monarchs to feed and or lay their eggs as they start the annual migration to Mexico.
Surplus funds will be applied to PIBO's educational outreach program to students in Essex County/Windsor area.
Work plan:  (1) Providing a quality habitat for Monarch Butterflies by planting and maintaining various species of Milkweed and other nectar plants for all life stages of the Monarch.  (2) To educate others about the threats to Monarch butterflies and possibly to connect with the Monarch Trail in Leamington. (3) By growing wildflowers that are carefully selected to match Pelee Island’s unique ecosystem, we hope to provide a healthy stop over site for the Monarchs to rest and refuel for their flight over Lake Erie.
Benefits: A long-term healthy habitat with a variety of native plant species means that Monarch Butterflies will be supported in all their life stages.  Through this program, we will educate others about the threats to Monarch butterflies and possibly to connect with the Monarch Trail in Leamington to create a connection between the mainland and the island. By growing wildflowers that are carefully selected to match Pelee Island’s unique ecosystem, we hope to provide a healthy stop over site for the Monarchs to rest and refuel to continue their migration over Lake Erie. Of course, not only Monarch butterflies will benefit from our efforts, but also other species of butterflies that rely on native plants will also find refuge.
Why us and what we can do? PIBO owns a small piece of property on McCormick Road on Pelee Island. Zoned agricultural, it can be used for conservation purposes and public use. Originally intended for an educational centre/staff housing, the plot is an ideal spot for a conservation initiative such as a Monarch Butterfly garden, as it is located adjacent to Fish Point Nature Reserve, a designated IBA (Important Bird Area) location.
Who we are: Pelee Island Bird Observatory is a non-profit charitable organisation devoted to the study and conservation of birds. Our mandate includes long-term migration monitoring as a member of the Canadian Migration Monitoring Network; long –term studies of Pelee’s breeding bird communities; to serve as an educational centre for the public and local schools and to highlight the importance of Pelee’s unique natural heritage. It is because of this last point that this new initiative was formed.
Why Monarchs? Each fall, North American Monarchs travel from their summer breeding grounds to overwintering locations travelling between 2-5,000 kms. Monarchs, like other butterflies and moths, undergo complete metamorphosis, meaning they have an egg, larva, pupa and adult stage. The egg and caterpillar stages occur only on species of milkweed (genus Asclepias) whereas adults survive by drawing nectar from a variety of flowering plants. As is the case with migratory birds, monarchs use Pelee Island as a stopover site. Moreover, the staff of PIBO have been conducting a Monarch migration count for over a decade. As with the general trend elsewhere, we have noticed a considerable reduction in their numbers over the years.
Threats to Monarchs: The major risks in Canada include: The use of pesticides and herbicides; the loss of native plant species; the propagation of non-native plant species and the escape of these species into natural areas; Development, mainly urban sprawl; Damage to Milkweed from ground level ozone (smog) and drought. (David Suzuki Foundation)

 
Site Preparation: Recently a flora and fauna survey was performed on the site, and unfortunately some invasive species were discovered. Phragmites, garlic mustard and English ivy were found growing in the plot. These invasive species will need to be removed as soon as possible. The garlic mustard is located mostly in one area of the site, and a pulling is planned for the end of May. The Ontario Invasive Plant Council suggests that the removal of Garlic Mustard be done in early spring before the plants have set seed. They also suggest simultaneously planting the native plants, such as Milkweed as the seed bank will be depleted and this will stimulate germination and increase the likelihood of removal success.PIBO has researched some potential sources for Milkweed seeds and plants.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We are a group of doers. When in 2003 Rick received a call from a farmer about a 766 hectare forest that was about to turn ashes, he acted. He took his money and purchased the whole piece. He's not a billionaire or a Hollywood actor. Just a guy that loves nature and hates waste.</p>
<p>17 years since then. Two world economic downturns, lost apartment and even a sold refrigerator away, Rick is still keeping the forest standing, paying property taxes and sustaining local community - people that chose not to sell their land to soy farmers but keep their living the way it has always been. (watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDXjRsmx7JQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Big Tree Story trailer</a> - a project of a documentary that was going to tell the story of Rick's company, his 3D program and environmental effort).</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<p>Then, we created Big Tree Adventure Tours. Because so many people have visited that forewst and then asked ""Why don't you ever take tourists here"". Big Tree Adventure Tours became one of the ways to fund this forest when times were hard. Today, our tours are among the best offered in the whole Amazon. And they are the perks we're offering you for supporting this initiative.</p>

<p><strong>The Amazon is not only about the jungle, wildlife and indigenous culture. Santarem was the epicenter of economic development through the rubber boom, cocoa and mor for over 200 years. We are fascinated by the hidden stories of this place and share them through our tours. The Rubber Path cruise features most of them - from archaeological sights with 6000-year-old artefacts to american-made houses turning into brazilian villages like Belterra (on the photo).</strong></p>
<p>Today we want to take more action. On March 29th, 2020, we rode out there and saw huge machines harvesting soy. Nothing wrong about it, except where they were doing this was once standing a millennial forest. There must be another way to feed people, empower communities and NOT to destroy Amazon Rain Forest.</p>
<p>And there is. Eco-tourism, sustainable logging, collecting organic materials, family non-toxic agriculture - it all can put together environmental and economic sustainability.</p>
<p>For over 30 years Rick lead the project of his life - using leftover or otherwise burnt hardwoods from the amazon rain forest to make timber frames. He created the 3D project - Dying, Dead and Down - the idea of harvesting only fallen and dead trees for wood. He supported organic plantations around São Benedito - the village that borders with his land. Before 2003 this village was full of people that had a hard yet happy life in the nature: collecting Brazil Nuts, Cumaru seeds and Breu Sap, planting manioc and fishing. A big farmer came in and people sold their land moving to the city. a couple of years later they would have no money and no land. And the forest? Well, in 2010, a journalist from New York, Andrew Blackwell, published the book ""Visit Sunny Chernobyl"" where he called the land Rick had purchased before the farmers ""An island of forest in the ocean of soy"". </p>
<p>So, we got tired of helplessly watching the devastation. We want to preserve and expand the rain forest. We want to buy nearby properties, conserve, replant, teach people how to make organic plantations and find a good use for them. We want to study this forest that has more mysteries than we ever imagined. We want canopy platforms, walks, river expeditions. We want the forest to stand and people around it to be happy. That's why we need your help.</p>

<p>This campaign is launched to help us fund 2 achievements:</p>
<p>1) make a full study of the 766 hectares of the forest: tree species, plants, wildlife and river fauna. That includes hiring biologists, environmental engineers, people to clear the river path, install trail cameras and build canopy platforms. And, yes, this forest will be open for visits - it will actually become the biggest outdoor adventure park in the world with the lowest impact on the nature. From getting to tree tops to tubing in a narrow creek in the middle of the jungle - you'll be able to enjoy it all.</p>
<p>2) secure the property. For 17 years Rick Paid and Zero Impact Brazil have been paying property taxes, surveys, local employees that keep hunters, loggers and forest fires away with ZERO governmental support. And Rick wants to make sure that after he's gone, there's a conservation program rolling that guarantees the preservation and expansion of this forest. When we say expansion, we mean that we are ready to purchase more land around 766 to preserve and replant rain forest. Hollywood stars could do it, but they don't. So, we'll do.</p>

<p><strong>El poder está en la comunidad</strong></p>
<p>De esta manera decidimos darle el poder a las personas que apoyan iniciativas a favor de un mundo mejor, y podremos empujar todos para difundir el mensaje eco-friendly a medida que crecemos junto con nuestra audiencia.</p>
<p><strong>Empezar por el principio</strong></p>
<p>Aunque hemos recibido varias propuestas de inversión de parte de grandes personas que comparten nuestra visión del mundo, en esta etapa debemos validar nuestro servicio, salir al mercado y construir comunidad. Y por supuesto, también mantener nuestro espíritu libre mientras armamos las bases de nuestra marca.</p>
<p><strong>Rondas de inversión a futuro</strong></p>
<p>Dicho lo anterior, en caso de que te interese invertir en VEKO, nos encantaría saber de tí y tu visión, y estar en contacto para futuras conversaciones. Prepararemos informes ejecutivos especiales para darte visibilidad del negocio.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622635774/ayreszgilkx4abbb2nwo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>CONTRIBUYE</strong> si tienes nuestra misma preocupación por la sostenibilidad. Hay un gran número de nuevas empresas sostenibles que son altamente dependientes de pequeñas contribuciones. Cuando sea posible, el hecho de aportar cantidades asequibles de dinero en este tipo de proyectos es vital para poner nuevos negocios al servicio de un futuro mejor para todos. </p>
<p><strong>COMPARTE</strong> con tus círculos sociales. Tus contactos eco-friendly se alegrarán de conocer VEKO. Difundir el mensaje y compartir iniciativas con impacto es también una gran ayuda. Estemos orgullosos de ser agentes de cambio!</p>
<p><strong>Con tu apoyo</strong>, nos ayudas a asegurar la base necesaria para facilitar los primeros pasos financieros y poder enfocar en la calidad de nuestro servicio y en la viabilidad de nuestro negocio. ¡Sería mucho más difícil sin tu ayuda!</p>

<p>La mayoría del presupuesto objetivo es para financiar el <strong>lanzamiento</strong> del servicio de video, planeado <strong>entre Octubre y Diciembre de 2021</strong>. Los costos principales implican soporte tecnológico, campañas de marketing y generación de contenido.</p>
<p>Además, hay una serie de costos asociados al armado de esta campaña en IndieGoGo (comisiones, tarifas financieras y costos de las recompensas). También reservamos fondos para seguir trabajando en el diseño de identidad corporativa (algunos costos ya fueron incurridos) y para financiar un soporte legal inicial relacionado con la gestión de derechos de autor.</p>
<p><strong>A continuación puedes ver el desglose.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622654714/xig3vxifmf1wmnk0efzw.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>¿Tendremos más costos?</strong></p>
<p>Efectivamente, ya que este crowdfunding es realizado solo para financiar el lanzamiento de VEKO. Posteriormente, incurriremos in costos operativos mensuales, soporte tecnológico y legal adicional, tarifas de hosting, impuestos y otros. Sin embargo, como estamos comprometidos con VEKO y con el mensaje a favor de la sostenibilidad, financieremos dichos costos con fondos personales mientras trabajamos en generar ingresos.</p>
<p><strong>¿Qué tecnología utilizaremos?</strong></p>
<p>Nuestra evaluación tecnológica aún está en proceso. Sin embargo, podemos anticipar que utilizaremos los servicios de marcas punteras en negocios relacionados con videos, como por ejemplo Uscreen, Vimeo, IBM o Bright Cove. Esto implica que vamos a terciarizar el desarrollo de código y los servicios de analytics e inteligencia artificial. De esta forma podremos operar enfocados en nuestra marca, comunidad y contenido.</p>
<p><strong>¿Haremos un lanzamiento a nivel global?</strong></p>
<p>Más allá del espíritu global de VEKO, enfocaremos esfuerzos iniciales en la promoción de la plataforma en España y Argentina, ya que contamos con un buen entendimiento de estas culturas y sus respectivos mercados de video. De esta forma también asentaremos la base para futuras campañas en otros países hispano-parlantes.</p>
<p>Dicho eso, el contenido estará disponible para la audiencia global, ofreciendo subtítulos en inglés inicialmente. Iremos paso a paso siguiendo el principio de ""menos es más"" mientras vamos obteniendo experiencias para el desarrollo de un modelo eficiente .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622635843/ik1wtnzkab33cpbnd5po.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nuestro aprendizaje sobre el mercado de videos nos ha llevado a entender que el elemento más importante en esta etapa es la construcción de comunidad, por lo cual dedicaremos tiempo y esfuerzos a ello, y con su crecimiento podremos ofrecer contenido que requiera pagos específicos por parte de los usuarios (nuevos lanzamientos, masterclasses, eventos en vivo). Ese modelo se llama ""Freemium"" y funciona bien con una audiencia de tamaño <strong>MEDIUM</strong>. Esperamos encontrarnos en ese punto en 4-8 meses luego de salir al mercado, y estimamos permanecer Freemium por un largo período mientras seguimos desarrollando nuestro modelo, posicionando nuestra marca y preparándonos para crecer hacia un tamaño <strong>LARGE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A continuación detallamos más. </strong>Imaginemos juntos un increíble sendero hacia una comunidad <strong>XL</strong>!</p>

<p><br/><strong>Changemakers to Rule</strong></p>
<p>This way we decide to give the power to an amazing community that would be pushing and spreading the eco-friendly message as we growth together along with our audience.</p>
<p><strong>Start from the Beginning</strong></p>
<p>Although we have received more than a couple investment proposals from great people who share our vision, now is time to validate our service, go to market and to build community. And of course, to remain free-spirit while we assemble our brand.</p>
<p><strong>Fundraising to be Continued</strong></p>
<p>That being said, in case you are interested on investments, we will love to hear from you and your vision, and stay connected for future conversations. We will prepare a special executive summary for you to get some visibility of the business.</p>

<p><br/><strong>CONTRIBUTE</strong> if you are concerned about sustainability. There is a new generation of responsible startups that are highly dependent on the support of low-scale contributions. When possible, putting affordable amounts of money on these kind of initiatives is key to put businesses at the service of a better future for everyone. </p>
<p><strong>SHARE</strong> with your social circles. Your eco-friendly contacts will be glad to hear about us. Spreading the message and sharing meaningful initiatives is a huge way to help as well. Let's be proud of been changemakers!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>The majority of the targeted budget is to fund the <strong>release</strong> of the streaming service, which is planned to take place <strong>between October and December 2021</strong>. The core costs of it involves tech support, marketing campaigns and content provision.</p>
<p>Besides, there are a series of costs associated with setting this crowdfunding (comissions, financial fees and rewards costs). We are also allocating some funds for branding design (some costs already incurred) and initial legal support around copyright licensing.</p>
<p><strong>Check more details below.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do we have more costs?</strong></p>
<p>Yes indeed, since this crowdfunding is designed only for the setup and release of VEKO Stream. So afterwards, we will incur in monthly operative costs, more technology support, hosting fees, taxes and others. However, as we have an eco-friendly heart fueling this project, we are committed to fund these additional costs with personal savings whilst we work to generate revenues.</p>
<p><strong>What's the technology we are using?</strong></p>
<p>Our technology asessment is still in progress. However, we can anticipate that we will use the machinery provided by leading video services companies like Uscreen, Vimeo, IBM or Bright Cove. Meaning that we will outsource coding, analytics and artificial intelligence. That way we will be able to operate focused on our brand, community and content.</p>
<p><strong>Are we launching globally?</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the worldwide nature of VEKO, we will focus our initial efforts in promoting the platform in Spain and Argentina, as we have an understanding of these cultures and video marketplaces. This way we are also assembling the base for further landing in other spanish-speaker countries.</p>
<p>That being said, the content will be available for the worldwide audience, offering subtitles in english at the beginning. Keep in mind the importance of going step by step! We will stick to the “less is more promise” while shaping our model.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><br/>After a continuous learning process about this marketplace, we have learnt that the most important starting element will be audience growth, so we will dedicate time and efforts to it, and as it grows, we will be able to offer premium content that would require specific payment from users (new releases, masterclasses, live events). That's called the Freemium Model and it fits well with a <strong>MEDIUM</strong> size audience. We expect to land there in a 4-8 months timeline after going to market, and we expect to stay Freemium for a long time while we traction our model, gain our position in the marketplace and prepare to level-up to <strong>LARGE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Check more details below.</strong> And let’s imagine together an amazing path to a <strong>XL</strong> community!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Challenges &amp; Risks</strong></p>
<p>Our major challenges are to build a <strong>strong community</strong> and to continuously feed VEKO with <strong>quality content</strong>. There's where our main focus will be, staying in the ground along with our audience and listen to their needs. Plus, developing long term partnership with video creators and making sure to protect their work and copyrights.</p>
<p>The major risk is a fast cash burning scenario, specially in the marketing front. However, as this is a niche business, the passionate changemakers within our growing audience will be vital to reduce marketing costs, so we will make sure they are proud to raise the voice and help us keep growing to assure viability,</p>
<p>In parallel, as we have identified a wide range of financial aid channels promoting sustainability, we will make sure to have our best and updated elevator pitch prepared for submissions. Plus, we plan to go for a fundraising round in a 8-12 months timeline.</p>

VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL
ENGLISH VERSION DOWN BELOW
 
Estamos atravesando una excitante jornada para crear la primera versión de VEKO, la plataforma en donde las personas que quieren ver un mundo mejor encontrarán la claridad necesaria para poder llevar a cabo un estilo de vida responsable y compasivo. Imaginemos que maravilloso será contar con una plataforma del estilo Netflix  para un nicho de público preocupado por la ecología.
Veamos cómo ha surgido esta idea identificando algunos problemas debido a la inmensa cantidad de videos de todo tipo que existen actualmente.
 

 

Con tu contribución, ayudas a resolver este tipo de dificultades relacionadas con el exceso de videos que existen actualmente. Cada vez más el público eco-friendly necesita contenido específico, facilidades para encontrar personas afines y sensación de comunidad.
 



 
VEKO Stream está siendo diseñada para una audiencia específica con especial cuidado por el planeta, los animales y los seres humanos. Hay un movimiento creciente del cual formaremos parte ofreciendo contenido relevante para transformar hábitos. Un catálogo de videos con categorías claras y formatos modernos para una mejor alineación con tus intereses y estados de ánimo.
A continuación te mostramos nuestras características más destacadas! 
 

Al igual que tú, nosotros también estamos atravesando cambios y continuamente mirando variedad de videos relacionados con sostenibilidad, así que trabajaremos duro para seleccionar el mejor contenido y transmitirlo en nuestra plataforma.
 

Tendremos una categorización nunca vista antes. Ofreceremos una novedosa experiencia para el usuario más allá de las típicas categorías genéricas ""Naturaleza"" y ""Medio Ambiente"" utilizadas en las plataformas masivas actuales.
 

Ya sea que te encuentres en el transporte público, en una fila esperando, o en el sillón de casa, tendremos diversos formatos y tipos de historias para tu mejor conveniencia y el estado de ánimo del momento.
 

¡Correcto! Nunca nos olvidaríamos de incluir algo de diversión. Mientras estamos comprometidos con un futuro mejor, disfrutaremos en comunidad cuando las temáticas que más nos interesan sean destacadas y se viralizen.
 

Aunque sea tentador desarrollar una estética propia, seguiremos el estilo de mayor éxito en varias plataformas actuales, que facilitará el sentido de familiarización y comprensión por parte de nuestros usuarios. Echemos un vistazo a algunos ejemplos de cómo se vería!

El poder está en la comunidad
De esta manera decidimos darle el poder a las personas que apoyan iniciativas a favor de un mundo mejor, y podremos empujar todos para difundir el mensaje eco-friendly a medida que crecemos junto con nuestra audiencia.
Empezar por el principio
Aunque hemos recibido varias propuestas de inversión de parte de grandes personas que comparten nuestra visión del mundo, en esta etapa debemos validar nuestro servicio, salir al mercado y construir comunidad. Y por supuesto, también mantener nuestro espíritu libre mientras armamos las bases de nuestra marca.
Rondas de inversión a futuro
Dicho lo anterior, en caso de que te interese invertir en VEKO, nos encantaría saber de tí y tu visión, y estar en contacto para futuras conversaciones. Prepararemos informes ejecutivos especiales para darte visibilidad del negocio.
 

CONTRIBUYE si tienes nuestra misma preocupación por la sostenibilidad. Hay un gran número de nuevas empresas sostenibles que son altamente dependientes de pequeñas contribuciones. Cuando sea posible, el hecho de aportar cantidades asequibles de dinero en este tipo de proyectos es vital para poner nuevos negocios al servicio de un futuro mejor para todos. 
COMPARTE con tus círculos sociales. Tus contactos eco-friendly se alegrarán de conocer VEKO. Difundir el mensaje y compartir iniciativas con impacto es también una gran ayuda. Estemos orgullosos de ser agentes de cambio!
Con tu apoyo, nos ayudas a asegurar la base necesaria para facilitar los primeros pasos financieros y poder enfocar en la calidad de nuestro servicio y en la viabilidad de nuestro negocio. ¡Sería mucho más difícil sin tu ayuda!
 

La mayoría del presupuesto objetivo es para financiar el lanzamiento del servicio de video, planeado entre Octubre y Diciembre de 2021. Los costos principales implican soporte tecnológico, campañas de marketing y generación de contenido.
Además, hay una serie de costos asociados al armado de esta campaña en IndieGoGo (comisiones, tarifas financieras y costos de las recompensas). También reservamos fondos para seguir trabajando en el diseño de identidad corporativa (algunos costos ya fueron incurridos) y para financiar un soporte legal inicial relacionado con la gestión de derechos de autor.
A continuación puedes ver el desglose.

¿Tendremos más costos?
Efectivamente, ya que este crowdfunding es realizado solo para financiar el lanzamiento de VEKO. Posteriormente, incurriremos in costos operativos mensuales, soporte tecnológico y legal adicional, tarifas de hosting, impuestos y otros. Sin embargo, como estamos comprometidos con VEKO y con el mensaje a favor de la sostenibilidad, financieremos dichos costos con fondos personales mientras trabajamos en generar ingresos.
¿Qué tecnología utilizaremos?
Nuestra evaluación tecnológica aún está en proceso. Sin embargo, podemos anticipar que utilizaremos los servicios de marcas punteras en negocios relacionados con videos, como por ejemplo Uscreen, Vimeo, IBM o Bright Cove. Esto implica que vamos a terciarizar el desarrollo de código y los servicios de analytics e inteligencia artificial. De esta forma podremos operar enfocados en nuestra marca, comunidad y contenido.
¿Haremos un lanzamiento a nivel global?
Más allá del espíritu global de VEKO, enfocaremos esfuerzos iniciales en la promoción de la plataforma en España y Argentina, ya que contamos con un buen entendimiento de estas culturas y sus respectivos mercados de video. De esta forma también asentaremos la base para futuras campañas en otros países hispano-parlantes.
Dicho eso, el contenido estará disponible para la audiencia global, ofreciendo subtítulos en inglés inicialmente. Iremos paso a paso siguiendo el principio de ""menos es más"" mientras vamos obteniendo experiencias para el desarrollo de un modelo eficiente .
 

Nuestro aprendizaje sobre el mercado de videos nos ha llevado a entender que el elemento más importante en esta etapa es la construcción de comunidad, por lo cual dedicaremos tiempo y esfuerzos a ello, y con su crecimiento podremos ofrecer contenido que requiera pagos específicos por parte de los usuarios (nuevos lanzamientos, masterclasses, eventos en vivo). Ese modelo se llama ""Freemium"" y funciona bien con una audiencia de tamaño MEDIUM. Esperamos encontrarnos en ese punto en 4-8 meses luego de salir al mercado, y estimamos permanecer Freemium por un largo período mientras seguimos desarrollando nuestro modelo, posicionando nuestra marca y preparándonos para crecer hacia un tamaño LARGE.
A continuación detallamos más. Imaginemos juntos un increíble sendero hacia una comunidad XL!

 






 
ENGLISH VERSION BELOW
 
We are in an exciting journey to pilot VEKO, the platform where changemakers will find the clarity needed to shape the future of a responsible and compassionate lifestyle. Just imagine how great would be to have a Netflix-style platform for a niche of environmental concerned audience.
Let's start from the beginning by mentioning some problems within the overcrowded video space in present times.
 

 

With your support, you help to address these kind of matters related with the current superabundance of videos everywhere. There is a need for the eco-friendly audience to be provided with more specific content as well as to be surrounded by a network of like minded people.
 

 

 

VEKO Stream is being designed for a cater audience with special care about the planet, the animals and the human beings. There is a movement going on and we will be part of it by offering relevant content to transform habits, with clear categories and diverse formats to facilitate a better matching with interests and mood.
Check below our highlighted features! 
 

As we are also going through changes, we continuously watch a variety of videos around environment topics, so we will work hard to curate superb stuff to be showcased in our platform.
 

Never-seen-before category listing. We will offer a deep dive experience beyond the usual  ""Nature"" and ""Environment"" grouping which ends up being very generic.
 

Whenever you are in the metro, in the waiting line, or chilling at home, we will have multiple formats and types of storytelling for your best convenience and mood matching.
 

Yeahp! We wouldn't forget to have some fun too. While we commit with a better future, let's enjoy together when environmental topics stand out in modern and trendy formats.
 

Although is tempting to create our own look & feel, at the beginning our esthetic will follow the most proven model which bring familiarity to users. Let's take a glimp to some examples!
 
Example 1

Example 3


Like it so far?!Let's keep asking questions...
 

 

 

Changemakers to Rule
This way we decide to give the power to an amazing community that would be pushing and spreading the eco-friendly message as we growth together along with our audience.
Start from the Beginning
Although we have received more than a couple investment proposals from great people who share our vision, now is time to validate our service, go to market and to build community. And of course, to remain free-spirit while we assemble our brand.
Fundraising to be Continued
That being said, in case you are interested on investments, we will love to hear from you and your vision, and stay connected for future conversations. We will prepare a special executive summary for you to get some visibility of the business.
 

CONTRIBUTE if you are concerned about sustainability. There is a new generation of responsible startups that are highly dependent on the support of low-scale contributions. When possible, putting affordable amounts of money on these kind of initiatives is key to put businesses at the service of a better future for everyone. 
SHARE with your social circles. Your eco-friendly contacts will be glad to hear about us. Spreading the message and sharing meaningful initiatives is a huge way to help as well. Let's be proud of been changemakers!
With your support, you assure the base we need to reduce struggling and to focus on service quality and business viability. Would be much more difficult without your help!
 

 
The majority of the targeted budget is to fund the release of the streaming service, which is planned to take place between October and December 2021. The core costs of it involves tech support, marketing campaigns and content provision.
Besides, there are a series of costs associated with setting this crowdfunding (comissions, financial fees and rewards costs). We are also allocating some funds for branding design (some costs already incurred) and initial legal support around copyright licensing.
Check more details below.

 
Do we have more costs?
Yes indeed, since this crowdfunding is designed only for the setup and release of VEKO Stream. So afterwards, we will incur in monthly operative costs, more technology support, hosting fees, taxes and others. However, as we have an eco-friendly heart fueling this project, we are committed to fund these additional costs with personal savings whilst we work to generate revenues.
What's the technology we are using?
Our technology asessment is still in progress. However, we can anticipate that we will use the machinery provided by leading video services companies like Uscreen, Vimeo, IBM or Bright Cove. Meaning that we will outsource coding, analytics and artificial intelligence. That way we will be able to operate focused on our brand, community and content.
Are we launching globally?
Regardless of the worldwide nature of VEKO, we will focus our initial efforts in promoting the platform in Spain and Argentina, as we have an understanding of these cultures and video marketplaces. This way we are also assembling the base for further landing in other spanish-speaker countries.
That being said, the content will be available for the worldwide audience, offering subtitles in english at the beginning. Keep in mind the importance of going step by step! We will stick to the “less is more promise” while shaping our model.
 

After a continuous learning process about this marketplace, we have learnt that the most important starting element will be audience growth, so we will dedicate time and efforts to it, and as it grows, we will be able to offer premium content that would require specific payment from users (new releases, masterclasses, live events). That's called the Freemium Model and it fits well with a MEDIUM size audience. We expect to land there in a 4-8 months timeline after going to market, and we expect to stay Freemium for a long time while we traction our model, gain our position in the marketplace and prepare to level-up to LARGE.
Check more details below. And let’s imagine together an amazing path to a XL community!

 
Challenges & Risks
Our major challenges are to build a strong community and to continuously feed VEKO with quality content. There's where our main focus will be, staying in the ground along with our audience and listen to their needs. Plus, developing long term partnership with video creators and making sure to protect their work and copyrights.
The major risk is a fast cash burning scenario, specially in the marketing front. However, as this is a niche business, the passionate changemakers within our growing audience will be vital to reduce marketing costs, so we will make sure they are proud to raise the voice and help us keep growing to assure viability,
In parallel, as we have identified a wide range of financial aid channels promoting sustainability, we will make sure to have our best and updated elevator pitch prepared for submissions. Plus, we plan to go for a fundraising round in a 8-12 months timeline.

In traditional Amazonian wisdom, the human being is part of the jungle, of the earth and its elements. The human being is not the owner of nature, not someone with the authority to make decisions about the delicate balance of life without first asking permission from the nature spirits.</p><p>It was known in ancient times that whenever someone in the tribe or the community suffered from disease or ill health, it was because that delicate balance between human and nature was broken, and the only way to recover the health was to regain balance and harmony through sacred rituals.</p><p>After centuries in which civilization has advanced, the sacred balance is now forgotten and despised. Humans live in cities without coming into contact with the natural world. Modern life is full of pollutants and stress, fed by negative elements that affect health, schedules and jobs, leaving many human beings without a sense of healthy life. Humankind is enslaved by technology, and is consumed with spiritual emptiness.  Throughout our evolution, we have created many modern components that now contribute to our state of imbalance with nature.</p><p>Because of our Amazonian cultural heritage, we believe everything that exists is part of a spiritual energy network. Everything has consciousness and its own character on different levels. Everything has a sacred spirit: water, seas, rivers, trees, birds, rocks ….and the human being. Our bodies are also part of nature. When the balance is broken between humanity and the rest of nature, little by little the natural balance of our bodies breaks down in response to this imbalance and we get sick.</p><p>At Eyawasije Center, we have the intention and the fervent desire to recover this balance. We seek to do this through traditional practice and the responsible, trustworthy and ritualized management of plant teachers and medicines of the Amazon rainforest, in keeping with the teachings received from our ancestors. We call our center the Eyawasije Healing and Reconnection Center because we believe that healing comes when we connect with our natural state of being, far away from all the noise of modern life, feeling our bodies and the flow of our hearts in unison with the earth. Our space offers you the opportunity to recover mental silence, to listen to one’s own voice, to the voice of the forest, and the voice of the Divine.</p><h3><strong>Our space is your space</strong></h3><p>The space we create at Eyawasije Center is dedicated to the ritualized practice of ancestral Amazonian plant medicines, ecological and organic agriculture, inner silence, and protection of the Amazonian environment. The vision of healing that we offer does not come about through spontaneous miracles; it requires the hard work necessary for integration and recovery. At the same time, we are confident in the possibility of long-term healing that can result from changes to one’s life and consciousness. We see healing as a joint work where the will and active contribution of the patient play a very important role. We create a space for transformation where silence, seclusion from everyday life, the master plants, physical work, and a more spiritual vision of life itself operate in collaboration with the desire for healing of the people who decide to seek alternative solutions.</p><p>The idea is that, while at the Center, patients can relearn ways to create a healthy living space that can then be transported back into daily life. For this purpose, we offer different modalities that we hope will be adapted to what is needed for each participant in the journey towards healing and restoring lost balance. These modalities include:</p><p>- Silent retreats and agricultural work on our farm.</p><p>- Detox regime with Noni extract.</p><p>- Ritual ceremonies with the sacred plant teacher, Ayahuasca.</p><p>- Mild dietas with various Amazonian master and medicinal plants.</p><p>- Soursop or graviola leaf diet, support for anticancer therapies.</p><p>- Purges with detoxifying plants.</p><p>- Treatment with the sacred tobacco plant.</p><p>- Energy cleanses.</p><p>- Plant and flower baths.</p><p>- Strong dietas with master plants.</p><div>

</div><h3> </h3><h3>Where</h3><p>The center is located in a rural area called La Tormenta, in the Madre de Dios region, where the Amazon forest struggles every day for the effects of illegal mining, drug trafficking and deforestation.</p><p>The total area is 3 hectares:</p><p>Half a hectare is a secondary forest, in which the structures of the center will be built as eco-sustainable constructions that will respect the traditional architecture of the region. The other two hectares and a half of primary forest will be protected.</p><h3>About Us</h3><p>The Eyawasije project is born from the collaboration of the NGO Etnopharmakon and the Eyawasije team.</p><p><strong>Etnopharmakon</strong>: A NGO active for years in the protection and research in the field of Amazonian medicinal plants, also through the creation of a educational botanical garden (Amarumayo, created thanks to a Crowdfunding of 2014) and the organization of seminars on medicinal plants use, respecting the local knowledge and tradition.</p><p><strong>Eyawasije</strong> Team: Made up by curanderos, traditional medicine experts, botanical species’ cultivation and identification experts.</p><p>The reference person is the healer Carlo Marco Schenone Infante, with an experience of 18 years in the field of traditional Amazon medicine. Partner of Ethnopharmakon, he previously worked in Takiwasi center and he was trained by the Colombian master Taita Adonias Quintero of the Inga community.</p><h3>WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY BUILT AND WHAT WE NEED</h3><p>So far have we invested around $ 20,000 that we used to purchase the land, we started to plant some botanical species, we built the common and staff house (common rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, etc ...) and we started to build the Maloca.</p><p><strong>TO DO LIST:</strong></p><p>- To look for and buying the land. <strong>DONE</strong></p><p>- To build the main house with common areas: kitchen, dining room, recreation room, bathrooms, bedrooms for the staff. <strong>DONE</strong></p><p>- Maloca: the traditional space used for rituals and healing practices. <strong>UNDER  CONSTRUCTION</strong></p><p>- The house to receive the guests: 5 double bedrooms with private bathroom, common area with hammocks. <strong>TO DO</strong></p><p>- 5 Tambos: small huts used for the retreat treatment with medicinal plants, called dietas. These treatments are very delicate and require an isolated and relaxing space, ideal to reflect during the process undertaken with the dedicated master plant. <strong>TO DO</strong></p><p>- Water tower for the drinking water supply in the center. <strong>TO DO</strong></p><h3>HOW CAN YOU HELP US</h3><p>With a donation: being an independent non-profit organization we know that every dollar received can make the difference.</p><p>Spread the word through your social channels and talk about the campaign with your friends.</p><h3>YOUR DONATIONS WILL SERVE FOR</h3><p>- Protect an area of primary primary jungle allow the study and research in the field of traditional Amazonian medicine</p><p>- Create an educational and conservative botanical garden</p><p>- Create a space dedicated to the cure of people and to personal growth</p><p>- Creating a space of cultural exchange open to everyone</p><p>If we do not reach our goal the funds collected will be used to start the projects in order of priority.</p><p>If we exceed our goal the funds will be reinvested to expand the botanical garden and to develop the production of phytoreapeutic remedies (tinctures, extracts, creams, etc ...)</p><p><strong>The time to act is now!</strong></p><p><strong>Feel free to use the Indiegogo's tool to share this campaign where you can.

This requirement is in place so that each case can be evaluated on an individual basis. Once evaluation is complete, we can accept the patient’s participation and recommend treatments that best suits your needs.</p><p>We believe that our medicines and our treatments are very effective as long as people understand that all indications and requirements in our treatments must be followed exactly. Patients must also understand that what we offer is access to long-term processes of change and healing, not miraculous, instant solutions. Similarly, patients must arrive with a faithful commitment to finish what they start, the commitment to follow the indications given by the vegetalistas (traditional doctors), the commitment to enter a zone that is free from wifi and connection with the outside life, and the commitment to work with the land, according to the specific treatments. We believe that the collaboration of therapists familiar with working with plants is a key component to help the integration of the strong experiences that we will undergo in our processes in the center. All processes and treatments are accompanied by healthy and organic food, and we make every effort to get all local and farmers’ food that is dedicated to organic agriculture.</p><h3> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ESPANOL</strong></h2><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Recuperando la salud en el centro Eyawasije</strong></h3><p>A través de los siglos nuestros ancestros de la selva reconocieron que la raíz de toda enfermedad que afectaba a sus tribus, tenia su origen en un desequilibrio entre el ser humano y la naturaleza que lo rodea.</p><p>En la sabiduría tradicional amazónica, el ser humano es parte de la selva, de la tierra y sus elementos. El ser humano esta muy lejos de ser el dueño o quien decide sin pedir permiso sobre algo que ocurra en el delicado equilibrio de vida.</p><p>Se supo entonces que siempre que alguien en la tribu o toda la comunidad sufría de enfermedades, es porque se rompió ese delicado equilibrio, y la única forma de recuperar la salud era, a través de rituales sagrados, recuperar el balance y harmonía.</p><p>Después de siglos en que el ser humano ha avanzado en el tiempo, ese sagrado equilibrio está muy olvidado y menospreciado, ciudades sin contacto con lo natural, contaminantes y llenas de stress, alimentación con elementos muy negativos para la salud, horarios y trabajos sin un sentido de vida sana, tecnología esclavizante, nula vida espiritual, etc. Tantos males que hemos generado en nuestra evolución creando un desequilibrio con la naturaleza.</p><p>Nosotros creemos por herencia cultural que todo lo que existe es parte de una red energética-espiritual, todo tiene conciencia y carácter en diferentes niveles, todo tiene un espíritu sagrado, agua, mares, ríos, arboles, aves, rocas…. Y el ser humano. Al quebrarse el equilibrio con la naturaleza externa, poco a poco el equilibrio natural de nuestros cuerpos, que también son parte de la naturaleza, también se quiebra y es donde enfermamos.</p><p>En centro Eyawasije tenemos la conciencia y el deseo ferviente de recuperar este equilibrio a través de la práctica tradicional, el manejo responsable, fidedigno y ritualizado de plantas maestras y medicinales de la selva amazónica, en congruencia con las enseñanzas recibidas de nuestros antepasados.  </p><p>Por esto hemos llamado centro de sanación y reconexión a Eyawasije, pues creemos que no existe sanación sino nos conectamos en primer lugar con nuestro estado natural del ser, lejos de toda la bulla de la vida moderna, sintiendo nuestros cuerpos y el fluir de nuestros corazones al unisonó con la tierra, selva, riachuelo, etc. Nuestro espacio les ofrece la oportunidad de recuperar el silencio mental para escuchar la voz propia, la del bosque, la de lo divino.</p><h3><strong>Nuestro espacio, tu espacio</strong></h3><p>El espacio que creamos está dedicado a la practica ritualizada de la medicina ancestral amazónica, a la agricultura ecológica y orgánica, al silencio y a la protección del bosque amazónico circundante. La visión de sanación que ofrecemos no viene por un arte milagroso instantáneo, ni en una visión inmediata sin esfuerzo de recuperación, apostamos en los milagros que vienen del cambio de vida y de la conciencia, es un trabajo conjunto donde la voluntad y el aporte activo del paciente juega un rol muy importante. Creamos un espacio de transformación donde el silencio, el retiro de la vida cotidiana, las plantas maestras y medicinales, el trabajo físico, y una visión mas espiritual de la vida misma, juegan a favor de la voluntad de sanación de las personas que decidan por una forma alternativa de encontrar soluciones a sus dolencias.</p><p>La idea es que los pacientes reaprendan a crear un espacio de vida sana con nosotros para poder llevarlo a su espacio de vida cotidiana. </p><p>Para este efecto tenemos diversas modalidades que esperamos se adecuen a lo necesitado por los pacientes, que por si mismas o en conjunto puedan ayudar a recuperar el equilibrio perdido. </p><p>- Retiro détox con extracto de Noni.</p><p>- Sesiones rituales con la planta sagrada Ayahuasca.</p><p>- Dietas ligeras con diversas plantas maestras y medicinales amazónicas.</p><p>- Dieta de hojas de guanábana o graviola, como refuerzo para terapias antitumorales.</p><p>- Purgas con plantas desintoxicantes.</p><p>- Tratamiento con la planta sagrada del tabaco.</p><p>- Limpias energéticas.</p><p>- Baños con plantas.</p><p>- Seminarios de ayahuasca.</p><p>- Dietas fuertes con plantas maestras.</p><p> </p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

L’essere umano è lontano dall’essere il proprietario o colui che decide senza chiedere il permesso riguardo qualcosa che regge il delicato equilibrio della vita.</p><p>Era quindi risaputo che ogni volta che qualcuno nella tribù o comunità soffriva di malattie, era proprio perché quel delicato equilibrio si era rotto, e l’unico modo per recuperare la salute era attraverso rituali sacri, per ritrovare equilibrio e armonia.</p><p>Dopo secoli della nostra “evoluzione”, l’equilibrio sacro è molto trascurato e sottovalutato, città senza contatto con la natura, produttrici di sostanze inquinanti e piena di stress, cibo con elementi molto negativi per la salute, orari di lavoro poco compatibili con una vita sana, tecnologia schiavizzante, vita spirituale inesistente, ecc. Tanti mali che abbiamo generato attraverso il nostro sviluppo creando uno squilibrio con la natura.</p><p>Abbiamo ereditato culturalmente la credenza che tutto ciò che esiste è parte di una rete spirituale-energetica, ogni cosa ha coscienza e carattere a diversi livelli, tutto possiede uno spirito sacro, acqua, mari, fiumi, alberi, uccelli, rocce …. E l’essere umano. Rompendo l’equilibrio con la natura esterna, a poco a poco anche l’equilibrio naturale dei nostri corpi, che sono anche parte della natura, si rompe ed é perciò che ci ammaliamo.</p><p>Nel centro Eyawasije abbiamo la consapevolezza ed il fervente desiderio di ritrovare questo equilibrio attraverso la pratica tradizionale, l’uso responsabile, affidabile e ritualizzato di piante medicinali della foresta amazzonica, in linea con gli insegnamenti ricevuti dai nostri antenati.</p><p>Per questo motivo lo abbiamo chiamato Centro di guarigione e riconnessione Eyawasije, proprio perché crediamo che non puo esserci guarigione senza una riconnessione con la nostra essenza, lontano dal trambusto della vita moderna, permettendo il fluire dei nostri cuori all’unisono con la terra, la selva, i torrenti, ecc. Il nostro spazio ti offre l’opportunità di recuperare il silenzio mentale per ascoltare la propia voce interna, quella della foresta, la voce divina.</p><h3><strong>Il nostro spazio, il tuo spazio</strong></h3><p>Lo spazio che creiamo è dedicato alla pratica ritualizzata della medicina ancestrale amazzonica, all’agricoltura ecologica e biologica, al silenzio e alla protezione della foresta amazzonica circostante. <br/>La visione di guarigione che offriamo non avviene istantaneamente come per miracolo o senza alcuno sforzo, ma crediamo fermamente nei miracoli che provengono dal cambiamento radicale della vita e della coscienza dell’individuo, che deriva da uno sforzo congiunto in cui la volontà e la partecipazione attiva del paziente ricopre un ruolo molto importante. Creiamo uno spazio per la trasformazione in cui il silenzio, il ritiro dalla vita quotidiana, le piante maestre e medicinali, il lavoro fisico e una visione più spirituale della vita stessa, giocano a favore della volontà di guarigione delle persone che optano per un modo differente di trovare soluzioni alle sue patologie.</p><p>L’idea è che i pazienti imparino a creare uno spazio di vita sano con noi per essere in grado di portarlo poi nel loro spazio quotidiano.<br/>A tale scopo abbiamo varie modalità che speriamo possano essere adattate a ciò che necessitano i nostri pazienti, le quali, singolarmente o combinate, possano aiutare a recuperare l’equilibrio perduto.</p><p>- Ritiro del silenzio e lavoro agricolo nel nostro terreno.</p><p>- Ritiro di disintossicazione con estratto di Noni.</p><p>- Sessioni rituali con la pianta sacra dell’Ayahuasca.</p><p>- Diete leggere con varie piante amazzoniche e medicinali.</p><p>- Dieta con foglie di Guanabana come coadiuvante per terapie antitumorali.</p><p>- Purghe con piante disintossicanti.</p><p>- Trattamento con la pianta sacra del tabacco.</p><p>- Pulizia energetica.</p><p>- Bagni con piante.</p><p>- Diete forti con piante maestre.</p><p> </p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

In traditional Amazonian wisdom, the human being is part of the jungle, of the earth and its elements. The human being is not the owner of nature, not someone with the authority to make decisions about the delicate balance of life without first asking permission from the nature spirits.It was known in ancient times that whenever someone in the tribe or the community suffered from disease or ill health, it was because that delicate balance between human and nature was broken, and the only way to recover the health was to regain balance and harmony through sacred rituals.After centuries in which civilization has advanced, the sacred balance is now forgotten and despised. Humans live in cities without coming into contact with the natural world. Modern life is full of pollutants and stress, fed by negative elements that affect health, schedules and jobs, leaving many human beings without a sense of healthy life. Humankind is enslaved by technology, and is consumed with spiritual emptiness.  Throughout our evolution, we have created many modern components that now contribute to our state of imbalance with nature.Because of our Amazonian cultural heritage, we believe everything that exists is part of a spiritual energy network. Everything has consciousness and its own character on different levels. Everything has a sacred spirit: water, seas, rivers, trees, birds, rocks ….and the human being. Our bodies are also part of nature. When the balance is broken between humanity and the rest of nature, little by little the natural balance of our bodies breaks down in response to this imbalance and we get sick.At Eyawasije Center, we have the intention and the fervent desire to recover this balance. We seek to do this through traditional practice and the responsible, trustworthy and ritualized management of plant teachers and medicines of the Amazon rainforest, in keeping with the teachings received from our ancestors. We call our center the Eyawasije Healing and Reconnection Center because we believe that healing comes when we connect with our natural state of being, far away from all the noise of modern life, feeling our bodies and the flow of our hearts in unison with the earth. Our space offers you the opportunity to recover mental silence, to listen to one’s own voice, to the voice of the forest, and the voice of the Divine.Our space is your spaceThe space we create at Eyawasije Center is dedicated to the ritualized practice of ancestral Amazonian plant medicines, ecological and organic agriculture, inner silence, and protection of the Amazonian environment. The vision of healing that we offer does not come about through spontaneous miracles; it requires the hard work necessary for integration and recovery. At the same time, we are confident in the possibility of long-term healing that can result from changes to one’s life and consciousness. We see healing as a joint work where the will and active contribution of the patient play a very important role. We create a space for transformation where silence, seclusion from everyday life, the master plants, physical work, and a more spiritual vision of life itself operate in collaboration with the desire for healing of the people who decide to seek alternative solutions.The idea is that, while at the Center, patients can relearn ways to create a healthy living space that can then be transported back into daily life. For this purpose, we offer different modalities that we hope will be adapted to what is needed for each participant in the journey towards healing and restoring lost balance. These modalities include:- Silent retreats and agricultural work on our farm.- Detox regime with Noni extract.- Ritual ceremonies with the sacred plant teacher, Ayahuasca.- Mild dietas with various Amazonian master and medicinal plants.- Soursop or graviola leaf diet, support for anticancer therapies.- Purges with detoxifying plants.- Treatment with the sacred tobacco plant.- Energy cleanses.- Plant and flower baths.- Strong dietas with master plants.

 WhereThe center is located in a rural area called La Tormenta, in the Madre de Dios region, where the Amazon forest struggles every day for the effects of illegal mining, drug trafficking and deforestation.The total area is 3 hectares:Half a hectare is a secondary forest, in which the structures of the center will be built as eco-sustainable constructions that will respect the traditional architecture of the region. The other two hectares and a half of primary forest will be protected.About UsThe Eyawasije project is born from the collaboration of the NGO Etnopharmakon and the Eyawasije team.Etnopharmakon: A NGO active for years in the protection and research in the field of Amazonian medicinal plants, also through the creation of a educational botanical garden (Amarumayo, created thanks to a Crowdfunding of 2014) and the organization of seminars on medicinal plants use, respecting the local knowledge and tradition.Eyawasije Team: Made up by curanderos, traditional medicine experts, botanical species’ cultivation and identification experts.The reference person is the healer Carlo Marco Schenone Infante, with an experience of 18 years in the field of traditional Amazon medicine. Partner of Ethnopharmakon, he previously worked in Takiwasi center and he was trained by the Colombian master Taita Adonias Quintero of the Inga community.WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY BUILT AND WHAT WE NEEDSo far have we invested around $ 20,000 that we used to purchase the land, we started to plant some botanical species, we built the common and staff house (common rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, etc ...) and we started to build the Maloca.TO DO LIST:- To look for and buying the land. DONE- To build the main house with common areas: kitchen, dining room, recreation room, bathrooms, bedrooms for the staff. DONE- Maloca: the traditional space used for rituals and healing practices. UNDER  CONSTRUCTION- The house to receive the guests: 5 double bedrooms with private bathroom, common area with hammocks. TO DO- 5 Tambos: small huts used for the retreat treatment with medicinal plants, called dietas. These treatments are very delicate and require an isolated and relaxing space, ideal to reflect during the process undertaken with the dedicated master plant. TO DO- Water tower for the drinking water supply in the center.

Share it with everyone you know.Hashtag your communications about the campaign with #eyawasijeFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK / OUR WEBImportantBefore patients are accepted for any treatment at Eyawasije Center, patients must present a clinical history and medical background information. This requirement is in place so that each case can be evaluated on an individual basis. Once evaluation is complete, we can accept the patient’s participation and recommend treatments that best suits your needs.We believe that our medicines and our treatments are very effective as long as people understand that all indications and requirements in our treatments must be followed exactly. Patients must also understand that what we offer is access to long-term processes of change and healing, not miraculous, instant solutions. Similarly, patients must arrive with a faithful commitment to finish what they start, the commitment to follow the indications given by the vegetalistas (traditional doctors), the commitment to enter a zone that is free from wifi and connection with the outside life, and the commitment to work with the land, according to the specific treatments. We believe that the collaboration of therapists familiar with working with plants is a key component to help the integration of the strong experiences that we will undergo in our processes in the center. All processes and treatments are accompanied by healthy and organic food, and we make every effort to get all local and farmers’ food that is dedicated to organic agriculture.  ESPANOL Recuperando la salud en el centro EyawasijeA través de los siglos nuestros ancestros de la selva reconocieron que la raíz de toda enfermedad que afectaba a sus tribus, tenia su origen en un desequilibrio entre el ser humano y la naturaleza que lo rodea.En la sabiduría tradicional amazónica, el ser humano es parte de la selva, de la tierra y sus elementos. El ser humano esta muy lejos de ser el dueño o quien decide sin pedir permiso sobre algo que ocurra en el delicado equilibrio de vida.Se supo entonces que siempre que alguien en la tribu o toda la comunidad sufría de enfermedades, es porque se rompió ese delicado equilibrio, y la única forma de recuperar la salud era, a través de rituales sagrados, recuperar el balance y harmonía.Después de siglos en que el ser humano ha avanzado en el tiempo, ese sagrado equilibrio está muy olvidado y menospreciado, ciudades sin contacto con lo natural, contaminantes y llenas de stress, alimentación con elementos muy negativos para la salud, horarios y trabajos sin un sentido de vida sana, tecnología esclavizante, nula vida espiritual, etc. Tantos males que hemos generado en nuestra evolución creando un desequilibrio con la naturaleza.Nosotros creemos por herencia cultural que todo lo que existe es parte de una red energética-espiritual, todo tiene conciencia y carácter en diferentes niveles, todo tiene un espíritu sagrado, agua, mares, ríos, arboles, aves, rocas…. Y el ser humano. Al quebrarse el equilibrio con la naturaleza externa, poco a poco el equilibrio natural de nuestros cuerpos, que también son parte de la naturaleza, también se quiebra y es donde enfermamos.En centro Eyawasije tenemos la conciencia y el deseo ferviente de recuperar este equilibrio a través de la práctica tradicional, el manejo responsable, fidedigno y ritualizado de plantas maestras y medicinales de la selva amazónica, en congruencia con las enseñanzas recibidas de nuestros antepasados.  Por esto hemos llamado centro de sanación y reconexión a Eyawasije, pues creemos que no existe sanación sino nos conectamos en primer lugar con nuestro estado natural del ser, lejos de toda la bulla de la vida moderna, sintiendo nuestros cuerpos y el fluir de nuestros corazones al unisonó con la tierra, selva, riachuelo, etc. Nuestro espacio les ofrece la oportunidad de recuperar el silencio mental para escuchar la voz propia, la del bosque, la de lo divino.Nuestro espacio, tu espacioEl espacio que creamos está dedicado a la practica ritualizada de la medicina ancestral amazónica, a la agricultura ecológica y orgánica, al silencio y a la protección del bosque amazónico circundante. La visión de sanación que ofrecemos no viene por un arte milagroso instantáneo, ni en una visión inmediata sin esfuerzo de recuperación, apostamos en los milagros que vienen del cambio de vida y de la conciencia, es un trabajo conjunto donde la voluntad y el aporte activo del paciente juega un rol muy importante. Creamos un espacio de transformación donde el silencio, el retiro de la vida cotidiana, las plantas maestras y medicinales, el trabajo físico, y una visión mas espiritual de la vida misma, juegan a favor de la voluntad de sanación de las personas que decidan por una forma alternativa de encontrar soluciones a sus dolencias.La idea es que los pacientes reaprendan a crear un espacio de vida sana con nosotros para poder llevarlo a su espacio de vida cotidiana. Para este efecto tenemos diversas modalidades que esperamos se adecuen a lo necesitado por los pacientes, que por si mismas o en conjunto puedan ayudar a recuperar el equilibrio perdido. - Retiro détox con extracto de Noni.- Sesiones rituales con la planta sagrada Ayahuasca.- Dietas ligeras con diversas plantas maestras y medicinales amazónicas.- Dieta de hojas de guanábana o graviola, como refuerzo para terapias antitumorales.- Purgas con plantas desintoxicantes.- Tratamiento con la planta sagrada del tabaco.- Limpias energéticas.- Baños con plantas.- Seminarios de ayahuasca.- Dietas fuertes con plantas maestras. 

 
 ImportanteCabe resaltar que antes de aceptar pacientes para cualquier tratamiento, los pacientes deben presentar sus historias clínicas, así con previa evaluación de sus casos podamos aceptar su participación y recomendar los tratamientos que más se ajusten a sus necesidades.Creemos que nuestra medicina es muy efectiva siempre y cuando, las personas entiendan que se deben seguir todas las indicaciones y requerimientos que nuestros tratamientos necesitan, y entender que lo que ofrecemos son procesos de cambio y sanación no soluciones milagrosas. Así mismo el compromiso fiel de terminar lo que se comience, el compromiso de seguir las indicaciones dadas por los médicos vegetalistas, el compromiso de entrar en una zona libre de wifi y conexión con la vida exterior, el compromiso de trabajar con la tierra, de acuerdo a las posibilidades dentro de los tratamientos específicos. Creemos que la colaboración de terapeutas familiarizados con el trabajo con plantas, para ayudar a la integración de las fuertes experiencias que viviremos en nuestros procesos en el centro, es un eje importante.Todo proceso es acompañado por alimentación sana y orgánica, tratando de conseguir todos los alimentos  locales y de agricultores que se dediquen a la agricultura orgánica.DONDEEl centro está situado en la Amazonía peruana, en la zona rural La Tormenta, cerca de la ciudad de Puerto Maldonado, capital de la región de Madre de Dios, un lugar que sufre diariamente a causa de la enorme difusión de la minería ilegal, del narcotráfico y de la deforestación.El área total es de 3 hectáreas, media hectárea de bosque secundario en la que se realizarán las estructuras del centro, construcciones ecosostenibles que respetarán la forma con la que siempre se ha construido en la selva, y las otras dos hectáreas y media de selva primaria serán protegidas y cuidadas.QUIENES SOMOSEl proyecto EYAWASIJE nace de la colaboración de la ONG Etnopharmakon y del equipo de EYAWASIJE.Etnopharmakon: ong activa desde hace años en la protección, valorización e investigación en el campo de las plantas medicinales amazónicas, también a través de la creación de un jardín botánico didáctico (Amarumayo, creado gracias a un crowdfunding en el 2014) y la organización en Perú y España de laboratorios y de seminarios con plantas medicinales en el respeto de los conocimientos y de las tradiciones locales.Equipo EYAWASIJE: compuesto por curanderos, expertos de medicina tradicional expertos de cultivo y reconocimiento de especies botánicas.

L’essere umano è lontano dall’essere il proprietario o colui che decide senza chiedere il permesso riguardo qualcosa che regge il delicato equilibrio della vita.Era quindi risaputo che ogni volta che qualcuno nella tribù o comunità soffriva di malattie, era proprio perché quel delicato equilibrio si era rotto, e l’unico modo per recuperare la salute era attraverso rituali sacri, per ritrovare equilibrio e armonia.Dopo secoli della nostra “evoluzione”, l’equilibrio sacro è molto trascurato e sottovalutato, città senza contatto con la natura, produttrici di sostanze inquinanti e piena di stress, cibo con elementi molto negativi per la salute, orari di lavoro poco compatibili con una vita sana, tecnologia schiavizzante, vita spirituale inesistente, ecc. Tanti mali che abbiamo generato attraverso il nostro sviluppo creando uno squilibrio con la natura.Abbiamo ereditato culturalmente la credenza che tutto ciò che esiste è parte di una rete spirituale-energetica, ogni cosa ha coscienza e carattere a diversi livelli, tutto possiede uno spirito sacro, acqua, mari, fiumi, alberi, uccelli, rocce …. E l’essere umano. Rompendo l’equilibrio con la natura esterna, a poco a poco anche l’equilibrio naturale dei nostri corpi, che sono anche parte della natura, si rompe ed é perciò che ci ammaliamo.Nel centro Eyawasije abbiamo la consapevolezza ed il fervente desiderio di ritrovare questo equilibrio attraverso la pratica tradizionale, l’uso responsabile, affidabile e ritualizzato di piante medicinali della foresta amazzonica, in linea con gli insegnamenti ricevuti dai nostri antenati.Per questo motivo lo abbiamo chiamato Centro di guarigione e riconnessione Eyawasije, proprio perché crediamo che non puo esserci guarigione senza una riconnessione con la nostra essenza, lontano dal trambusto della vita moderna, permettendo il fluire dei nostri cuori all’unisono con la terra, la selva, i torrenti, ecc. Il nostro spazio ti offre l’opportunità di recuperare il silenzio mentale per ascoltare la propia voce interna, quella della foresta, la voce divina.Il nostro spazio, il tuo spazioLo spazio che creiamo è dedicato alla pratica ritualizzata della medicina ancestrale amazzonica, all’agricoltura ecologica e biologica, al silenzio e alla protezione della foresta amazzonica circostante. La visione di guarigione che offriamo non avviene istantaneamente come per miracolo o senza alcuno sforzo, ma crediamo fermamente nei miracoli che provengono dal cambiamento radicale della vita e della coscienza dell’individuo, che deriva da uno sforzo congiunto in cui la volontà e la partecipazione attiva del paziente ricopre un ruolo molto importante. Creiamo uno spazio per la trasformazione in cui il silenzio, il ritiro dalla vita quotidiana, le piante maestre e medicinali, il lavoro fisico e una visione più spirituale della vita stessa, giocano a favore della volontà di guarigione delle persone che optano per un modo differente di trovare soluzioni alle sue patologie.L’idea è che i pazienti imparino a creare uno spazio di vita sano con noi per essere in grado di portarlo poi nel loro spazio quotidiano.A tale scopo abbiamo varie modalità che speriamo possano essere adattate a ciò che necessitano i nostri pazienti, le quali, singolarmente o combinate, possano aiutare a recuperare l’equilibrio perduto.- Ritiro del silenzio e lavoro agricolo nel nostro terreno.- Ritiro di disintossicazione con estratto di Noni.- Sessioni rituali con la pianta sacra dell’Ayahuasca.- Diete leggere con varie piante amazzoniche e medicinali.- Dieta con foglie di Guanabana come coadiuvante per terapie antitumorali.- Purghe con piante disintossicanti.- Trattamento con la pianta sacra del tabacco.- Pulizia energetica.- Bagni con piante.- Diete forti con piante maestre. 

 
 ImportanteÈ da notare che prima di accettare i pazienti per qualsiasi trattamento, essi dovranno presentare le loro storie mediche, e solo dopo una valutazione preliminare dei loro casi potremo accettare la loro partecipazione e raccomandare i trattamenti che meglio si adattano alle loro esigenze.Crediamo che la nostra medicina sia molto efficace solo quando le persone accettano di seguire tutte le indicazioni e rispettare le esigenze di cui i nostri trattamenti necessitano, e capiscano che ciò che offriamo sono processi di cambiamento e guarigione, non processi miracolosi.Allo stesso modo è necessario un sincero impegno a finire ciò che si è iniziato, l’impegno a seguire le indicazioni fornite dai medici vegetalisti, l’impegno ad entrare in una zona priva di wifi e connessione con la vita esteriore, l’impegno a lavorare la terra. Ovviamente secondo le possibilità previste dai trattamenti specifici.Crediamo che la collaborazione di terapeuti che hanno familiarità con l’uso delle piante, per aiutare a integrare le forti esperienze che si sperimentano nei nostri processi, sia un asse importante del nostro lavoro.Tutto il processo è accompagnato da cibo sano, cercando di ottenere tutti gli alimenti a livello locale e da agricoltori che si dedicano ad un tipo di agricoltura biológica e rispettosa del medioambiente.DOVEIl centro è situato nell’amazzonia peruviana, nella zona rurale La Tormenta, vicino alla città di Puerto Maldonado, capoluogo della regione Madre de Dios, un luogo che soffre quotidianamente a causa dell’enorme diffusione di miniere illegali, del narcotraffico, della deforestazione.L’area totale è di 3 ettari, mezzo ettaro di bosco secondario in cui verranno realizzate le strutture del centro, costruzioni ecosostenibili alla maniera in cui si è sempre costruito nella selva, i restanti due ettari e mezzo di foresta primaria vergine che verrà protetta e tutelata.CHI SIAMOIl progetto EYAWASIJE nasce dalla collaborazione della ONG Etnopharmakon e dall’equipe EYAWASIJE.Etnopharmakon: ong attiva da anni nella tutela , valorizzazione e ricerca nel campo delle piante medicinali amazzoniche anche attraverso la creazione di un giardino botanico didattico (Amarumayo, creato grazie ad un crowdfunding nel 2014) e l’organizzazione in Perù e in Spagna di laboratori e di seminari con piante medicinali, nel rispetto delle conoscenze e tradizioni locali.Equipe EYAWASIJE: composta da curanderos, esperti di medicina tradizionale, esperti di coltivazione e riconoscimento di specie botaniche. La figura di riferimento è il curandero Carlo Marcio Schenone Infante, con un’esperienza di 18 anni nel campo della medicina tradizionale amazzonica, già collaboratore di Etnopharmakon e formatosi presso il centro Takiwasi e presso il maestro colombiano Taita Adonias Quintero della comunità Inga.QUANTO SIAMO SERIFino ad ora abbiamo investito circa 20.000 dollari con i quali abbiamo comprato la terra, iniziato a piantare alcune specie botaniche, costruito la casa comune e per lo staff (sale comuni, dormitori, cucina, etc), iniziato a costruire la maloca.COSA ABBIAMO GIA' REALIZZATO E COSA CI MANCA- Ricerca e acquisto della terra. FATTO- Costruzione casa principale con aree comuni: cucina, sala da pranzo, sala svago, bagni, dormitori per lo staff. FATTO- Maloca, costruzione tradizionale di forma circolare, utilizzata per rituali e pratiche di cura. IN COSTRUZIONE- Casa per l’accoglienza degli ospiti: 5 stanze doppie ognuna con un bagno privato, area comune con amache. DA FARE- 5 Tambos: piccole capanne utilizzate per trattamenti di ritiro con piante medicinali, chiamate diete. Questi trattamenti sono molto delicati e richiedono uno spazio isolato e tranquillo, ideale per riflettere durante il processo intrapreso con la pianta maestra dedicata. DA FARE- Torre dell’acqua per poter usufruire di acqua potabile all’interno del centro. DA FARECOME PUOI AIUTARCICon una donazione: essendo un’associazione no profit indipendente sappiamo che ogni singolo dollaro ricevuto in donazione può fare la differenza.Diffondendo la voce ai tuoi amici attraverso i canali social e a voceLE TUE DONAZIONI SERVIRANNO PER- Proteggere un pezzo di foresta primaria vergine- Permettere lo studio e la ricerca nell’ambito della medicina tradizionale amazzonica- Creare un giardino etnobotanico didattico e conservativo- Creare uno spazio dedito alla cura delle persone e alla crescita personale- Creare uno spazio di interscambio culturale aperto a tuttiSe non raggiungeremo l’obbiettivo i fondi raccolti verranno utilizzati per iniziare i lavori in ordine di priorità.Se supereremo l’obbiettivo i fondi in più verranno reinvestiti per ampliare il giardino botanico e per sviluppare la produzione di rimedi fitoterapici (tinture, estratti, creme, etc)Ogni giorno vediamo devastare la foresta, combattendo contro taglialegna e minatori illegali. La deforestazione e l’inquinamento delle fonti acquifere sono dei problemi reali.

Our mission is to unify, empower, and amplify the voices that are creating the just society we want for us and our future generations.We run initiatives such as the Good Brand Awards, to reward organisations that don’t do ‘business as usual’, recognising their efforts to build a new economic model based on social and environmental respect.The Reconciliation Candle campaign is aimed at supporting the work of organisations, entrepreneurs and initiatives creating positive change, whether working on personal, environmental or social transformation, at a local or global scale.Why do we need this?Shining the light on stories that restore dignity and hope.We are surrounded by so many stories of violence, economic crises, inequality, persecution, leadership crises, and scepticism that can make us feel the world is a ruthless and unsafe place. This negative overload polarises our views, driving us farther and farther apart. However, there is another side of the coin: the incredible work of many who are bringing about societal transformation, and bringing borders. Yet, we hardly hear these stories of hope, and celebrate our triumphs against all odds.We believe in promoting and celebrating the restorative stories of love, forgiveness, and common vision that bring people together.By supporting the campaign, you help in giving visibility to stories that don't get covered due to budget restrictions or conflict of interests, but which are essential to restore our faith in the future of humanity. We know that many of you share this belief, and we very much hope you will join us. What you are supportingWe believe that promoting a reconciliation mindset is key to overcome crisis. We are looking to raise £8,000 to sponsor pro-bono coverage of positive stories. To make it simple for everyone to support this initiative, we have produced a limited edition of beautifully crafted signature candles.The funds will go to develop a dedicated section on our website to feature successful reconciliation stories collected from around the world. Beyond creating awareness, we also want to inspire everyone to write their own success story, find out about opportunities to use their talent, or get involved with initiatives, social enterprises and causes they believe in.About our limited edition candlesOur luxury scented candles are handmade in Italy by a small family-owned business based on sustainability values. They are 100% vegan, use unleaded cotton wicks, and natural fragrances. The candles are made using an ancient formula and purely vegetable waxes, respecting the local artisan tradition and zero-carbon production. Other ways you can helpSupporting this campaign will help us give voice to those less heard, but also make everyone aware of opportunities to engage. We are a platform for all. Be part of it.

Our ManifestoNow that people are the most important thing for people,Now that we know that the greatest risk is not to risk,Now that we don’t need to be asleep to dream,Now it’s time to start again.Our StorySublime started in March 2004 as a group of 30 media people gathered to discuss what a contemporary magazine should be all about. In a year’s time, the group devoted to Sublime grew to 300 influencers from around the world, making Sublime the first magazine movement with such wide collaboration and following before its launch.Urban, entertaining, informative, and thought-provoking, Sublime captures the spirit of our time, championing the values of a new economic paradigm based on sustainable entrepreneurship, community, and interdependence.As independent publishers, we have over 15-year’s experience in tackling entrepreneurial challenges.

</div></div>","Hello! We are DYCLE – Diaper Cycle, a non profit initiative to support parents who want to dispose of baby diapers in a sustainable way. We turn diapers into black soil and nutrients
for millions of trees that will provide fruit and nuts back to the community for many years to come. 
What is Diaper Cycle? DYCLE creates black soil out of baby diapers helping to close the nutrients and materials cycle for diapers. We do this by collecting used compostable diapers and mixing them with charcoal and kitchen waste. As a diaper is full of baby waste, it contains excellent nutrients and degrades into hygienic and fertile black earth.

DYCLE has already successfully tested the diapers collection and composting process with a pilot project in May 2015, and a week's supply of diapers from 20 babies is almost fully degraded as of November 2015.


What do we want to do with the funds?

The funds are being raised to establish our operations in Berlin. Meanwhile, spreading our network to 5 other cities is in the plans for 2016. The largest part of the budget will go to compostable diapers for our first community of parents and to upscaling our operations.
Should you contribute if you are not in Berlin? 
Yes. After the first community is established in Berlin, we will teach people in other locations how to do it, and so the movement grows.

Every gift wrapped with  <a href=""http:www.wraptcollective.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wrapt Collective </a>materials helps to preserve and regenerate forests, and keep Santa afloat. <br/><br/>To give back to the environment, Wrapt Collective wrapping paper and gift tags are printed on 100% recycled paper, the ribbon and sticky tape are 100% biodegradable, plus 50% of profits go to reforestation. If enough people wrap this way, we could eventually have more trees planted than cut down every Christmas!<br/>

<p>Our aim is to transform Christmas one gift at a time, from the most wasteful time of year, into the most environmentally prosperous holiday (and save Santa from the sharks in the process). <br/></p>
<p>Not every gift bought this year will be sustainable, but every gift wrapped can be! <br/></p>

<b>What's going on at the North Pole?</b><br/>
</h3>Santa and his elves are in a bit of a tizz because the Arctic sea ice that surrounds the North Pole has decreased by 14% since the 1970's and <a href=""http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/what_we_do/climate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WWF </a>predicts that it may disappear in summer within the next generation. Which means, Santa and his elves may find themselves in a spot of bother and in need of some floaties!<br/>
<br/><h3><b>Why Christmas?</b></h3>Christmas is when we are our most generous but also our most wasteful.<br/><ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://getpocketbook.com/blog/christmas-shopping-infographic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">60% </a>of Australians spend more than they earn at Christmas. <br/>

<li>Globally it is estimated that around 23 million trees are cut down each Christmas to produce greeting cards and gift wrap.</li>
<li>But over 60% choose not to purchase more sustainable products because they are 'too expensive'.</li>

<b>What can I do?</b>
</h3>
<p>The average Australian spends <a href=""https://getpocketbook.com/blog/christmas-shopping-infographic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">$374 </a>on
 Christmas gifts each year, equating to a National total of $8 billion! 
We're hoping to attract at least a small portion of this to help our 
Christmas spending have a more positive impact without giving up gift 
wrapping. 
</p>
<p>We've set our campaign goal on $100,000 and Santa's helpers will be 
delivering perks regardless of how much we raise. But if you help us 
smash our goal (and Santa) out of the water, everyone who contributed 
will get an extra special gift!</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>
<b>Why can't I just buy it from <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/12-days-to-save-santa/www.wraptcollective.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wrapt Collective </a>directly?</b> <br/>
</h3>
<p>This is our first ever Wrapt Collective Christmas, and we wanted to make sure we only produce what we need. By pre-ordering your gift wrap, you're helping ensure we actually have profits to contribute to forest conservation and not wasting paper!</p>
<br/><h3><b>Our aim</b></h3>To save Santa from drowning &amp; help transform Christmas from the most wasteful time of year into the most environmentally generous holiday. <br/><br/>We wanted to use the much-loved tradition of gift wrapping to really make an impact. If everyone makes one small change to their Christmas shopping this year and chooses to wrap their gifts more sustainably, we could really start to have a positive effect on the environment. Eventually we hope that this will inspire other businesses to invest in more sustainable products.<br/><br/>Our main challenge this Christmas, is to reach our $100,000 goal to ensure we can continue Wrapt Collective's efforts throughout the year, covering Birthdays, Weddings, Christenings and just because presents. <br/><br/>50% of any profits remaining after the perks have been distributed will go to the Carbon Neutral Charitable Fund, with the other 50% going back into the business to  create new designs for a wider range of occasions, expansion of range (e.g into wine bags), and product innovation. <br/><br/><h3><b>Impact</b></h3>The money we spend at Christmas has a big impact! It's up to us to choose whether it's positive or negative. <b><br/><br/></b>At the moment, more trees are cut down than planted at Christmas. If enough people start wrapping their gifts using Wrapt Collective's 100% post-consumer waste recycled paper, with 50% of profits going to reforestation, we could eventually have more trees planted
 than cut down every Christmas<b>!<br/><br/></b>Help us transform Christmas from the most wasteful season into the most environmentally generous holiday (and avoid killing Santa in the process) by wrapping your gifts this Christmas in Wrapt Collective designs. <br/><br/>With no new trees cut down to produce Wrapt Collective paper and 50% of 
profits going to the Carbon Neutral Charitable fund to plant new 
Australian native trees and shrubs and conserve existing forests. <br/><br/>While we can't guarantee that wrapping your gifts with Wrapt Collective alone will save Santa, at least you'll be able to sleep easy knowing you weren't the one who accidentally killed him!<br/><br/><h3><b>In the Workshop...</b></h3>

</div></div>","The rising global temperature is melting the ice that surrounds the North Pole, and WWF predicts that if things don't start to cool down, it may disappear within the next generation, rendering Santa homeless and at risk of drowning! So the time has come to give back to Santa and make sure he can continue
 to call the North Pole home! To help save Santa, Wrapt Collective has created an easy way to wrap your gifts more sustainably this Christmas. Every gift wrapped with  Wrapt Collective materials helps to preserve and regenerate forests, and keep Santa afloat. To give back to the environment, Wrapt Collective wrapping paper and gift tags are printed on 100% recycled paper, the ribbon and sticky tape are 100% biodegradable, plus 50% of profits go to reforestation. If enough people wrap this way, we could eventually have more trees planted than cut down every Christmas!

Our aim is to transform Christmas one gift at a time, from the most wasteful time of year, into the most environmentally prosperous holiday (and save Santa from the sharks in the process). 
Not every gift bought this year will be sustainable, but every gift wrapped can be! 


Introducing...






Potato Print DesignsAll designs are hand crafted from Australian potatoes. 


100% Recycled Paper
Our potato print designs are reproduced on 100% post consumer waste recycled paper using soy based ink. Our printing partner, along with our paper are also FSC certified and Carbon Neutral. 


100% BiodegradableAll our wrapping materials including the wrapping paper, gift tags, curling ribbon and sticky tape are biodegradable. So you can just pop everything in the compost after the fun of unwrapping is over. Or, of course, reuse the paper on another gift. 
50% of profits go to forest conservation
We have partnered with the Carbon Neutral Charitable Fund to donate 50% of our operation profits after tax to forest conservation. This means we not only fund the planting of trees, but we make sure they're looked after! 
Packaging 
We are committed to making our business as environmentally friendly as possible, so our gift tag ties are made from biodegradable hemp and we ship our wrapping in recycled envelopes, boxes and tubes where possible. 



What's going on at the North Pole?
Santa and his elves are in a bit of a tizz because the Arctic sea ice that surrounds the North Pole has decreased by 14% since the 1970's and WWF predicts that it may disappear in summer within the next generation. Which means, Santa and his elves may find themselves in a spot of bother and in need of some floaties!
Why Christmas?Christmas is when we are our most generous but also our most wasteful.

60% of Australians spend more than they earn at Christmas. 

Globally it is estimated that around 23 million trees are cut down each Christmas to produce greeting cards and gift wrap.
But over 60% choose not to purchase more sustainable products because they are 'too expensive'.

What's in it for you?
Design testedThere's no way you can make a present wrapped in Wrapt Collective look bad! We've made sure all our designs look fabo together so you can mix and match till your heart's content. Plus the ribbon and paper are super easy to work with and we have tips on YouTube for inspiration. AffordableUnderstanding that the biggest barrier to purchasing sustainable products is price, we've done our best to make the Wrapt Collective range as affordable as possible, and included ways for everyone to get involved. Only with your support will we be able to reach the scale required to make our range even more affordable. Why not team up with your friends and family to get the best deal on a bulk perk! ShippingThe perks will be shipped during the first week of December to ensure arrival before Christmas. Wrapping

Curling Ribbon5/8"", 100% cotton Comes in three candy stripe designs: Red & White, Green & White, & Dark Green & Light GreenDyed using soy based dyes, the ribbon not only great to work with and very versatile, but is also biodegradable.Envirotape10x12mm, biodegradableThe tape that holds everything together, all your environmentally friendly efforts may come undone the sticky tape has to be removed from the paper before it can be recycled. 100% biodegradable, this tape allows you to pop all the Christmas unwrapping straight in the compost!
What can I do?

The average Australian spends $374 on
 Christmas gifts each year, equating to a National total of $8 billion! 
We're hoping to attract at least a small portion of this to help our 
Christmas spending have a more positive impact without giving up gift 
wrapping. 

We've set our campaign goal on $100,000 and Santa's helpers will be 
delivering perks regardless of how much we raise. But if you help us 
smash our goal (and Santa) out of the water, everyone who contributed 
will get an extra special gift!


Why can't I just buy it from Wrapt Collective directly? 

This is our first ever Wrapt Collective Christmas, and we wanted to make sure we only produce what we need. By pre-ordering your gift wrap, you're helping ensure we actually have profits to contribute to forest conservation and not wasting paper!
Our aimTo save Santa from drowning & help transform Christmas from the most wasteful time of year into the most environmentally generous holiday. We wanted to use the much-loved tradition of gift wrapping to really make an impact. If everyone makes one small change to their Christmas shopping this year and chooses to wrap their gifts more sustainably, we could really start to have a positive effect on the environment. Eventually we hope that this will inspire other businesses to invest in more sustainable products.Our main challenge this Christmas, is to reach our $100,000 goal to ensure we can continue Wrapt Collective's efforts throughout the year, covering Birthdays, Weddings, Christenings and just because presents. 50% of any profits remaining after the perks have been distributed will go to the Carbon Neutral Charitable Fund, with the other 50% going back into the business to  create new designs for a wider range of occasions, expansion of range (e.g into wine bags), and product innovation. ImpactThe money we spend at Christmas has a big impact! It's up to us to choose whether it's positive or negative. At the moment, more trees are cut down than planted at Christmas. If enough people start wrapping their gifts using Wrapt Collective's 100% post-consumer waste recycled paper, with 50% of profits going to reforestation, we could eventually have more trees planted
 than cut down every Christmas!Help us transform Christmas from the most wasteful season into the most environmentally generous holiday (and avoid killing Santa in the process) by wrapping your gifts this Christmas in Wrapt Collective designs. With no new trees cut down to produce Wrapt Collective paper and 50% of 
profits going to the Carbon Neutral Charitable fund to plant new 
Australian native trees and shrubs and conserve existing forests. While we can't guarantee that wrapping your gifts with Wrapt Collective alone will save Santa, at least you'll be able to sleep easy knowing you weren't the one who accidentally killed him!In the Workshop...


It's a bit quiet in the Wrapt Collective workshop at this time of year as Santa needs most of his helpers at the North Pole. We're hoping to hire some more helpers as a result of this campaign. Stephanta is one pretty capable little helper though, she's earned a marketing and accounting hat, which she switches between frequently. Mac also helps out where he can, but let's be honest, he's more moral support more than anything else.

Please note: Just like Global Warming, Santa may or may
not exist. But one thing’s for sure, you definitely don’t want to be the one  accidentally responsible for killing the guy, and surely it can't hurt to spend your money funding tree planting instead of tree felling!

<p><b>English</b> (Spanish translation at the bottom):</p><p>Our campaign aims to protect and document our local river, El Rio de Aguas by raising public awareness of its amazing wildlife and limited underground water resources.The ancient fossil water aquifer located in the Sorbas-Tabernas basin (Andalucia, Spain) that feeds our river has been over exploited to a point that it is about to disappear. The flow rate of the river has decreased from 40 litres per second to 10 litres per second, a drop in flow of 75%. As a result this unique river ecosystem is now facing Ecocide.<br/></p>

<h4>Our
Project</h4>
<p>
Our
project aims to document as many of the current species as possible,
starting with the ones most in danger of extinction, while also
documenting all the green areas on the river through a combination of
aerial filming, landscape photography and underwater filming. We hope
to inspire more people to actively get involved in the conservation
of this unique river, its water resources and surrounding national
park. Our photos and videos were recently featured on Spanish RTVE's
documentary ""El Ultimo Oasis"":

<p><span>But our financial resources are limited and here is where we need your help. Our project started in November 2014 and so far, the results have been beyond our expectations in terms of biodiversity: we have documented over 100 species, including over a dozen protected species and many rare species. We have also started an archive of river locations to include all the areas that still have water within the river basin. All together we have gathered a database of over 20,000 photos of both wildlife and landscapes. Some of these photos will be included in our upcoming pocket guide on ""Protected, endemic and rare species of Rio de Aguas"". Other photos are already exhibited in local markets and town halls:</span><br/></p>

<p>
La
amenaza más seria a la que se enfrenta nuestro río es la creciente
extracción de agua subterránea para regadío industrial. Se han
concedido permisos para extraer agua del acuífero que alimenta
nuestro río, destinada a regar 6000 hectáreas de plantaciones de

En
2010 un acuerdo entre la Junta de Andalucía y la Comisión Europea
estipulaba que para el 2015 la sobre-explotación se habría reducido
en un 200% respecto de las mediciones de agua que en 2010 mostraban
un exceso en la explotación de un 330%. Esta directiva no solo ha
sido totalmente ignorada, sino que además estimamos que con las
nuevas plantaciones la sobre-explotación está ahora en un 500%. A
día de hoy, Medio Ambiente y la Junta de Andalucía se mantienen
indiferentes y no responden a nuestras demandas de información
acerca de las condiciones del acuífero, además de estar evitando
responder al incumplimiento de los acuerdos de la C.E. de 2010. La

El

santuario para las especies locales y una hábitat temporal para
especies migratorias. La presencia de agua ha dado como resultado una
franja verde, que acoge a un gran número de plantas y especies de
insectos. Esta abundancia de plantas e insectos atrae especies que
normalmente son raras de ver en esta parte de España, como lo son
las tortugas mediterráneas y las tortugas galápago, innumerables
especies de pájaros, grandes herbívoros y omnívoros (como la cabra
montesa del sur de España,tejones

</div></div>","English (Spanish translation at the bottom):Our campaign aims to protect and document our local river, El Rio de Aguas by raising public awareness of its amazing wildlife and limited underground water resources.The ancient fossil water aquifer located in the Sorbas-Tabernas basin (Andalucia, Spain) that feeds our river has been over exploited to a point that it is about to disappear. The flow rate of the river has decreased from 40 litres per second to 10 litres per second, a drop in flow of 75%. As a result this unique river ecosystem is now facing Ecocide.

Our
Project

Our
project aims to document as many of the current species as possible,
starting with the ones most in danger of extinction, while also
documenting all the green areas on the river through a combination of
aerial filming, landscape photography and underwater filming. We hope
to inspire more people to actively get involved in the conservation
of this unique river, its water resources and surrounding national
park. Our photos and videos were recently featured on Spanish RTVE's
documentary ""El Ultimo Oasis"":
 http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/el-escarabajo-verde/escarabajo-verde-ultimo-oasis/3383219/


But our financial resources are limited and here is where we need your help. Our project started in November 2014 and so far, the results have been beyond our expectations in terms of biodiversity: we have documented over 100 species, including over a dozen protected species and many rare species. We have also started an archive of river locations to include all the areas that still have water within the river basin. All together we have gathered a database of over 20,000 photos of both wildlife and landscapes. Some of these photos will be included in our upcoming pocket guide on ""Protected, endemic and rare species of Rio de Aguas"". Other photos are already exhibited in local markets and town halls:


Our river is in danger of extinction!
The most serious threat to our river is the increased pumping of underground water for industrial irrigation. 6000 hectares of olive plantations have been given permissions to extract water from the aquifer that feeds our river. These trees are planted at a density of 1,800 trees per hectare, using approximately 5,000 tons of water per year per hectare. Over 2 million trees have already been planted.
In 2010 an agreement between Junta De Andalucia and the European Commission stipulated that by 2015 the over exploitation would be reduced by 200%, as the withdrawals of water in 2010 were already exceeding available resources by 330%. Not only has this directive been totally ignored, but we estimate that with the new plantations, the over exploitation is now at 500%. To this day Medio Ambiente and Junta de Andalucia remain indifferent and unresponsive to our requests for information relating to the condition of the aquifer, as well as evading responsibility for their non-compliance with their 2010 EC agreements. Intensive planting is continuing and extraction of water is increasing despite all signs of this resource depleting.

Why is Rio de Aguas unique?
El Rio de Aguas is the last oasis of abundant life in the fragile ecosystems of Paraje Natural Karst en Yesos of Sorbas and one of the few rivers in South of Spain that still flows all year round. 
The river is a remarkable example of a oasis effect in the only semi-arid zone in Western Europe with an average rainfall of around 200 mm of water/year, that's both a sanctuary for local species and a refuelling temporary home for migratory species. The presence of water has resulted in a corridor of green vegetation, that supports a large number of plant and insect species. This abundance of plants and insects attracts species that are normally rare in this part of Spain, such as endangered Mediterranean tortoises and pond turtles, countless species of birds, big herbivores and omnivores such as the Southern Spanish Ibex, badgers, wild boar and ultimately carnivores such as foxes, stone martens, genets, eagles, vultures and owls.
Parque Natural Karst en Yesos de Sorbas is Spain's most important karst landscape composed of gypsum (yeso), and one of the best examples of its kind in the world.

The park has only around 5% of Spain's total gypsum territory, but it harbors about  50% of its gypsophyte plant species, several of which are now at risk  of extinction.
Our budgetWith your donations we hope to have a permanent presence on the river, as follows:- a £2000 budget will buy more wildlife monitoring cameras, pay for printing of some campaign materials and ensure that we can continue running our project until the end of spring 2016- a £3000 budget will buy 10 extra monitoring cameras, cover our costs for printing and organizing additional exhibitions of our photos and videos locally, and keep our project running until the summer of 2016- a £4000 budget will buy us all the equipment needed such as monitoring cameras, lenses, gps devices, allow for printing and exhibiting photos, assist with talks and campaigns on the river, finalize our pocket guide on ""Protected, endemic and rare species of Rio de Aguas""  and keep the project running until the end of 2016.

Bonjour à tous,
Cured Vine est un projet scientifique mené par une équipe d'étudiants bordelais.

 
Bien sûr, ne vous en faites pas, nous allons tout faire pour rendre ce projet le plus compréhensible possible auprès de tous ! Ce projet est tout ce qu’il y a de plus sérieux et s’inscrit dans le cadre d’une compétition étudiante internationale : l’iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines). Comme son nom l’indique est une compétition de biologie de synthèse (on reviendra sur ce principe plus tard) organisée par la fondation iGEM qui rassemble cette année plusieurs centaines d’équipes à travers le monde. 


Comme chaque équipe participante, nous allons utiliser les outils de la biologie de synthèse pour imaginer et créer de nouveaux systèmes biologiques avec des propriétés étonnantes. La biologie de synthèse, c’est un des domaines qui connait le plus de croissance dans le secteur de la biologie et des biotechnologies. Cette discipline regroupe l’ensemble des techniques utilisées par les généticiens, les biologistes moléculaires et autres scientifiques qui permettent de concevoir des organismes vivants avec des caractéristiques inédites. 


Oui bon euh ... ça serait drôle en effet, mais ce n'est rien de tout ça. Ce que nous allons utiliser pour créer notre système biologique est un être vivant bien plus petit, même invisible à l’œil nu et pourtant présent dans chacun de nous. Il s'agit d'Escherichia coli et de Saccharomyces Cerevisae, qui sont respectivement une bactérie et une levure bien connue des scientifiques. 


Bien évidemment ! Vous ne le savez surement pas mais les bactéries sont utiles pour plein de choses. Ce sont même elles aujourd’hui qui produisent une partie des biocarburants ou certains de nos médicaments. Ce que nous allons leur faire fabriquer, c'est un traitement préventif pour la vigne et contre le Mildiou.Le Mildiou est une maladie dangereuse pour la vigne dont le seul traitement existant est le sulfate de cuivre. Cette petite poudre bleu est très efficace mais un fois qu'elle s'infiltre dans les sols elle pollue beaucoup et est mauvaise pour notre environnement.
L'iGEM Bordeaux propose une solution écologique qui s'appelle le Curdlan. Nous allons faire produire à notre bactérie et notre levure cette molécule qui n'est autre qu'un enchainement de pleins de glucoses à la suite. L'efficacité du Curdlan sur la vigne est déjà prouvé. En effet, une fois déposé sur ses feuilles, le Curdlan permet à la plante d'améliorer ses défenses immunitaires et de mieux se battre contre le Mildiou.

<div>If we don't make our goal, the funds we do collect will go to direct services.  These services will continue as long as we have funding.  All of your donations will go to help kids.  We pay no rent (our ranch is donated) or utilities (because we are strictly solar powered).  This means your funds really do go to the kids and horses.</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>At risk youth can be our next moms, dads, leaders, executives, artists, mathematicians, and policy makers.  But only if they have a chance to develop the sense of worth and confidence that lets them express their talents and heart.  This program offers direct healing experiences that develop these qualities.  It also invites the kids to return as mentors so they have an ongoing place of belonging.  They also learn the art of giving back.  Finally, they give a gift that few of us would have the courage to give....love and training for an unwanted horse....a devoted companion for the forever owner....a sense of self respect, bravery, compassion, and worth for themselves.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Not every kid makes nor does every horse.  Some quit.  Some cannot be rehabilitated.  But if even one makes it...one is rehabilitated...one finds a sense of belonging so living makes sense, it is worth it.  </p>

If we don't make our goal, the funds we do collect will go to direct services.  These services will continue as long as we have funding.  All of your donations will go to help kids.  We pay no rent (our ranch is donated) or utilities (because we are strictly solar powered).  This means your funds really do go to the kids and horses.   The Impact At risk youth can be our next moms, dads, leaders, executives, artists, mathematicians, and policy makers.  But only if they have a chance to develop the sense of worth and confidence that lets them express their talents and heart.  This program offers direct healing experiences that develop these qualities.  It also invites the kids to return as mentors so they have an ongoing place of belonging.  They also learn the art of giving back.  Finally, they give a gift that few of us would have the courage to give....love and training for an unwanted horse....a devoted companion for the forever owner....a sense of self respect, bravery, compassion, and worth for themselves.  
    Risks & Challenges Not every kid makes nor does every horse.  Some quit.  Some cannot be rehabilitated.  But if even one makes it...one is rehabilitated...one finds a sense of belonging so living makes sense, it is worth it.  
    Other Ways You Can Help We realize not everyone has money to give.  But you can help us by sharing this link with your friends and family.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><b>A simple solution to growing better plants</b></h2>As any gardener and nursery worker will tell you plants grown
in a pot have to be maintained to prevent them from becoming pot bound. Without
remedial action a pot bound plant is likely to become unhealthy and may even
die. Dealing with a pot bound plant is something that nurseries and keen pot
gardeners work hard to avoid because it means additional work to fix, and then
the plant may still die. 

<p>Typically pot plants will be re-potted, potentially several
times, to prevent the plant from becoming bound. Plant pots that have been
developed to reduce the likelihood of a plant becoming root bound have been
around for a while. I have developed a pot technology that goes a bit further
than these and may provide significant benefits. </p>

The
Gro-B-Lo is a re-usable plastic pot insert has the potential to greatly extend
the time that a plant may be kept in a pot thereby reducing the effort required
to maintain the plant and, as a bonus, results in bigger, stronger, healthier pot
plants that use water and fertiliser more efficiently. If the pot plant is
being grown on for planting out, when it is planted out the plant is less likely
to develop root shock, is less likely to die and is generally more robust. This
is likely to be related to improved root architecture and increased root
length.<br/><br/>
<p>The Gro-B-Lo is very simple, it forces the plant roots to grow
around the spiral training surface in the defined space. This results in
longer roots with an improved root architecture which utilises the soil matrix
more efficiently. In growing plants in pots, a ratio of above and below ground plant
mass that is close to 1:1 is something that the gardener is trying to achieve
and the Gro-B-Lo frequently comes closer to achieving this. That in itself was quite
a pleasing discovery but I have also found that plants grown using the Gro-B-Lo
appear to grow faster, have a greater stem circumference and stem length and a greater root length. The plants are just more robust. This was bought home to
me very firmly on a day following a 40<sup>o</sup>C day here in Tasmania –
something that is very uncommon. All of my control plants died, but every one
of the Gro-B-Lo plants survived and bounced back quickly.</p>

Now,
following personal investigations and preliminary trials of the Gro-B-Lo carried
out at commercial and teaching plant nurseries, I passionately believe that
this is a product that will not only reduce costs in plant maintenance but will
produce better pot plants for nurseries and the home gardener. <br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>I have taken out an interim patent on the device but I
need your help to meet the costs of patents in Australia, European Union, United
States, China, Japan, Brazil, Canada and India and if the campaign goes well
enough in South Africa and Kenya. Th  e target of $70,000 covers the costs of the patents
and lawyers and some set up costs. <br/><br/>We are not ready yet to produce the Gro-B-Lo but all donations will be rewarded in some way and certainly all are very much appreciated. <br/>
<p>All donators go on a

<p style="""">a portion of some donations to Gro-B-Lo can be passed on to a wildlife charity Cattle for Wildlife. <em>Cattle for
Wildlife </em>is a pilot
project of a larger program trialling a new approach to wildlife conservation. It
is based on the innovative approach of promoting the protection of endangered
wildlife by local communities, which in turn earn the proceeds from cattle

</h2>That the Gro-B-Lo works there is little doubt and I firmly believe that Gro-B-Lo has real potential to reduce the time and effort required to manage plants in pots. That is not just my opinion it is shared by nursery and garden professionals we have involved in the research and development. Any nursery that saves itself even one re-potting or pot maintenance event can make big savings. One of the most common comments we receive from people we are describing the Gro-B-Lo to is ""<i>Why has this not been done before.</i>""  <br/><br/>Another area that is unexpected but really seems to be something that needs to be looked at more is that I am using less water to produce plants that are bigger, better and stronger. I believe it is a consequence of both the Gro-B-Lo itself - e.g. it appears to reduce evaporative loss of water from the pot, and that the root architecture is such that much more of the soil matrix is accessed and utilised.<br/><br/>The Gro-B-Lo device and idea has received support from many within the plant industry and business leaders:<br/><br/><i>""<b>I have known Mark

<p>We are just two friends that have a dream to see the world and help our planet.</p>
<p>Our names are Ryan Dempsey and Seth Ruggiero and we have decided to spend about one year on our bicycles. Starting in June of 2016, we will begin our journey from Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska to Ushuaia, Argentina, the southernmost city in the world!  That's approximately 19,000 miles and 17 countries! Our route will run along the Pacific Ocean while roughly following the PanAmerican Highway system.</p>
<p></p>Along the way we will raise money to support a revolutionary non-profit organization, The Ocean Cleanup, which has developed ""the world's first feasible method to rid the oceans of plastic.""</div><div></div><div><br/></div>Although we have been saving money and already have purchased much of our necessary gear, we need extra help. Your donation will help with our day-to-day expenses (mostly food and a few untimely bicycle repairs). The remaining sum of money we raise will go directly to The Ocean Cleanup. Click <a href=""http://www.theoceancleanup.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to check out their website.<div>
<br/><div>
<div>
<p>We will have five or six consecutive two-month-long campaigns throughout the duration of our trip (IndieGogo only allows a maximum of 60 days to campaign). Every 2 months we hope to raise over $5,000. We truly hope to raise over $30,000 by the conclusion of our trip, most of which will be donated to The Ocean Cleanup. It's more than possible. </p>
<p>From our total funds raised on this site, we anticipate spending (in addition to our own funds) about $3,000 apiece during our year-long tour. If we can reach our goal of $5,000 per 2-month campaign, we will raise over $30,000 and donate nearly $25,000 to The Ocean Cleanup! In addition to raising money for The Ocean Cleanup, we will also personally remove one grocery bag of trash from a local waterway for each $100 raised before we depart on our journey.</p>
<p></p>If you don't want to promote our journey, at the very least educate yourselves about the terrible conditions our oceans are currently in. The world needs our help.

</div></div>","Our Goal
We are just two friends that have a dream to see the world and help our planet.
Our names are Ryan Dempsey and Seth Ruggiero and we have decided to spend about one year on our bicycles. Starting in June of 2016, we will begin our journey from Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska to Ushuaia, Argentina, the southernmost city in the world!  That's approximately 19,000 miles and 17 countries! Our route will run along the Pacific Ocean while roughly following the PanAmerican Highway system.
Along the way we will raise money to support a revolutionary non-profit organization, The Ocean Cleanup, which has developed ""the world's first feasible method to rid the oceans of plastic.""Although we have been saving money and already have purchased much of our necessary gear, we need extra help. Your donation will help with our day-to-day expenses (mostly food and a few untimely bicycle repairs). The remaining sum of money we raise will go directly to The Ocean Cleanup. Click here to check out their website.


We will have five or six consecutive two-month-long campaigns throughout the duration of our trip (IndieGogo only allows a maximum of 60 days to campaign). Every 2 months we hope to raise over $5,000. We truly hope to raise over $30,000 by the conclusion of our trip, most of which will be donated to The Ocean Cleanup. It's more than possible. 
From our total funds raised on this site, we anticipate spending (in addition to our own funds) about $3,000 apiece during our year-long tour. If we can reach our goal of $5,000 per 2-month campaign, we will raise over $30,000 and donate nearly $25,000 to The Ocean Cleanup! In addition to raising money for The Ocean Cleanup, we will also personally remove one grocery bag of trash from a local waterway for each $100 raised before we depart on our journey.
If you don't want to promote our journey, at the very least educate yourselves about the terrible conditions our oceans are currently in. The world needs our help. Read this article posted by The Geological Society of America about how this all affects humans, animals, and the earth.

  Climate change is important to everyone on our planet. There are two ways to solve the rising CO2 levels. Holistic land management and agriculture. Nothing else looks large enough to make an impact.

<p>California State is currently
undergoing a major drought. Recently, the State imposed water restrictions,
which would not have been necessary if my water-conservation toilet invention
had been funded and put on the market back when I first brought my project to
the State of California.</p>
<p>All toilets in the world today use
the original suction method, first invented over 200 years ago. In 2006, my
company, New Age Hygienic Systems, began development on a new model of toilet
which preserves water resources and flushes quickly and hygienically. By taking
advantage of nanotechnology and working with the molecular property of water
for the transport of solids through pipelines and sewage systems, we created a
toilet requiring very little water per flush, yet flushes so thoroughly that
its bowl is sanitized after each use. </p>
<p>New Age Hygienic Systems, Inc. has a
complete, production-ready prototype set up, and has a manufacturer ready to
start upon receipt of funding.</p>

undergoing a major drought. Recently, the State imposed water restrictions,
which would not have been necessary if my water-conservation toilet invention
had been funded and put on the market back when I first brought my project to
the State of California.
All toilets in the world today use
the original suction method, first invented over 200 years ago. In 2006, my
company, New Age Hygienic Systems, began development on a new model of toilet
which preserves water resources and flushes quickly and hygienically. By taking
advantage of nanotechnology and working with the molecular property of water
for the transport of solids through pipelines and sewage systems, we created a
toilet requiring very little water per flush, yet flushes so thoroughly that
its bowl is sanitized after each use. 
New Age Hygienic Systems, Inc. has a

start upon receipt of funding.

<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>The Karakoram Anomaly Project will
investigate one of the least understood natural hazards on the planet, glacial
lake outburst floods.</p><p>Glacial lake outburst floods are caused when
an ice or moraine dam containing a glacial lake bursts catastrophically. The
resulting torrent of water, ice and rock rushes downstream, much like a
tsunami. The
Karakoram has suffered more than 30 of these devastating outbursts in the
last 20 years, and it is believed that 80,000 people in the region are
currently at risk.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p>Glacial lake outburst floods are
not a new phenomenon. However, with current environmental change, their probability has risen in most mountain ranges. Glacial lakes are
particularly dangerous in the Karakoram as they occur at low elevations and
close to settlements. In some cases, potential outbursts allow only 10 to 40
minutes to trigger an alarm for the threatened population to evacuate to
safety. </p>
<p>It is a key time to understand
glacial lake outburst floods in the Karakoram, because of a phenomenon termed
the Karakoram anomaly. The Karakoram anomaly is one of the biggest mysteries of
glacial science. It describes the observation of growing glaciers in the
Karakoram, in contrast to shrinking glaciers in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“<i>The
Karakoram Anomaly describes the expansion of glaciers in central Karakoram in

Hi, I’m Oliver Forster. I am an environmental
geoscientist, sustainability consultant and mountaineering enthusiast. Scientific study has
taken me across the world, from the glaciers and volcanoes of Iceland to
Jamaica’s coral reefs, to the jagged peaks of the Himalayas. In the Himalayas,
I studied the role of glacial lake outburst floods in the 2010 ‘Cloudburst’
event – the extreme convective storm that devastated the people and region of Ladakh. In addition to hard science, I have hands on
experience of environmental and sustainability issues in business. I am passionate about exploring and
conserving the natural world for the benefit of future generations.


I am a professional
photographer and adventurer, inspired by the beauty of extreme environments and
the wild places of our planet. My passion lies in exploring and photographing
the remote regions of the world and sharing these adventures with others. To
express my vision I create large format, fine art photographs, multi-media
installations and photographic essays. I also aim to contribute to the
understanding of our environment by collaborating with scientists by using photographic
techniques to support scientific research.I have received awards in
several international competitions including Travel and Landscape Photographer
of The Year. My interest in nature photography has taken me to remote lands
such as the Arctic Circle, Mesoamerican barrier reef, and Himalayas where I
climbed the 5th highest mountain in
the world, Makalu (8463m).


I am a technical-creative
problem solver, and a lover of the wild and remote places of this planet. I
work as a photographer, cinematographer and a product designer. I have directed
and shot international advertising campaigns, remote alpine and rafting
expeditions, short and feature length films, and all manner of work in between.
As an alpinist, I started making many journeys to the Southern Alps of New
Zealand, followed by the European Alps and the Scottish Highlands. I have
partnered with various bodies and companies including Australian Geographic,
Sea to Summit and all of Australia and New Zealand’s prominent alpine clubs for
these expeditions. I have a real passion for teaching, and have worked casually
as an outdoor education instructor.

What we need and what you get

Delivering the project requires a massive logistical, physical and financial effort.
We need your help to make the project happen.
We need £12,000 to purchase
research equipment, organise the community workshops, sustain the team and local porters and craft a video documentary and photographic essays to share
our story with the world. 
We have designed unique perks to reward your kind
support. Check them out below!











Where are the funds going?

The raised funds will be used
towards the fulfilment of The Karakoram Anomaly Project's goals, including:
 - Supporting the logistics of this
complex expedition, including payment of a team of 30 collaborators and
porters in Pakistan 
 - Organising and running two community educational workshops 
 - Editing multimedia material and crafting a 45 min video documentary and several high
quality photographic essays, including time-lapse and repeat photography series. 


The project involves exploring
remote regions of Central Karakoram and travelling to high altitudes. There are
physical risks associated with this project. However, our team has a wealth of experience in the activities The Karakoram Anomaly project will involve. 
We have completed a full risk assessment and crisis management
plan, which has been reviewed by the University of Edinburgh Expeditions
Committee. The risk assessment includes an evaluation of physical, biological,
chemical, and man made hazards and also takes into consideration personal and
third party safety. We've also completed an environmental impact assessment, and endeavour to keep our environmental impact to a minimum. 
All team members will have travel and medical insurance for the full length of The Karakoram Anomaly Project covering activities associated with trekking and mountaineering.
In case of an emergency we will use our satellite phone to call the Pakistani
Army for helicopter rescue. Our insurance covers such emergency procedures. All
members have first aid training.
In a nutshell our risk assessment will follow the acronym:
 C - Clarify the hazards and risks
 R - Reassess and revise it where
necessary
  I - Involve all participants in
the process
 S - State it simply in writing
  I - If it’s too risky – don’t do
it!
 S - Share knowledge and experience

It was recently highlighted in articles published by the <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/07/23/highway_sand_runoff_is_blamed_for_a_new_island_in_charles_river/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Boston Globe</a> in 2011 and <a href=""http://news.wgbh.org/2016/04/21/local-news/charles-river-cleaning-after-mother-nature-and-climate-change"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WGBH</a> in 2016.  In recent years, sediment deposits have caused several incidents that have resulted in damage to watercraft and personal injury.  While the sediment appears to be a larger problem where major tributaries - Laundry Brook, Hyde Brook, Faneuil Brook, Muddy River, Stony Brook - empty into the Charles, once the sediment is in the river, it can spread to other areas, causing further problems especially where it is already shallow.  This problem is not limited to the areas upstream of the BU Bridge.  A significant bar upriver of the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge is shallow enough and large enough to be a navigation hazard to both sailboats and motorboats.  There are also the extraordinary events such as the water main breaks in Weston in May 2010 and near the Anderson Bridge in August 2015, both of which caused large amounts of sediment to be moved.</p><p>It has been difficult to marshal the resources to remediate areas impacted by sedimentation since much of the knowledge about the shallows and bars has been anecdotal, coming from the daily experiences of the boaters on the river but not backed up by quantitative data. To address this issue, the <a href=""http://www.CharlesRiverAllianceofBoaters.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charles River Alliance of Boaters</a> (CRAB) has developed a partnership with the <a href=""http://seagrant.mit.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MIT Sea Grant College Program</a> to create a chart of the river depth between Science Park and the Watertown Dam, and to monitor changes in the river bottom in the future. Based upon some feasibility studies done in late 2015, more detailed and extensive measurements were undertaken in 2016. To date, most of the river between Newton Yacht Club and the New Charles River Dam has been surveyed for depth (see image below) and relative hardness of the river bottom.

<li>
<b>Depth Measurements:</b><br/>Inexpensive fish-finders have been used to record the depth, time, and GPS position. While the depth is measured by the delay in the sonar echo, the relative hardness of the river bottom can be inferred from the strength of the sonar echo. The section of river between the BU Bridge and Community Rowing has been measured by driving sonar tracks at various distances from the shoreline. This has been done at the same time as we retrieve data from the depth data loggers (see below).<br/> </li>
<li>
<b>Influence of Daily Water Releases:</b><br/>As part of flood control measures, water from the river is released into Boston Harbor at low tide and held in the river at high tide, slowly accumulating. This causes the water level in the river to change over several inches during the course of a day. A USGS <a href=""http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ma/nwis/uv/?site_no=01104705&amp;PARAmeter_cd=00065,00060"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gauge</a> at the First Street Bridge in Cambridge records the variation in the height of the watersheet. While this gauge is a good measure of the watersheet downstream of the BU Bridge, there are no gauges further upriver and the variation in the height of the watersheet is not well understood.<br/>We have installed three gauges and data loggers at the Riverside Boat Club, Herter Park, and Community Rowing. These additional gauges have provided insight into how the height of the watersheet varies along the length of the river. Due to the lack of rainfall over the 2016 summer, the section of the river below the Watertown Dam has acted as a lake with the height of the watersheet varying almost uniformly along it entire length. If there had been more rainfall, it was expected that the height of the watersheet would have been different along the length of the river. We plan to keep the additional gauges installed for a few years and will continue to monitor how the height of the watersheet changes during periods of significant rainfall.<br/>In order to more accurately determine the depth of the river, all raw depth measurements have been adjusted to account for the variation in the height of the watersheet.<br/> </li>

</div><p><b>About Our Project</b></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.savecambodianmarinelife.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Save Cambodian Marine
Life</span></a> is a non-profit
organization (NGO) based on Koh Rong Samloem, a small island off the coast of
Sihanoukville. Two of us started this project because we have a huge passion
for marine conservation and see a great need for it in this developing country.
I’m James. I’m a New Zealander who has lived here for almost 5 years. Pierre is
Cambodian born and is passionate about protecting his country’s natural resources
and educating fellow local people. Being Khmer and part of this cause is a
great asset as we hope other Cambodians will see this and want to take part to
protect their beautiful country. Our goals of this funding project are:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>To create artificial Electro Reef systems that help regenerate
reefs damaged by destructive fishing methods and anchor damage.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>To educate the local community about their reefs and how
important they are to a healthy ocean eco-system.</p><p>We had an article written about us in the Phnom Penh post which you can read here: <a href=""http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/electricity-broken-tanks-and-exploded-cars"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/electricity-broken-tanks-and-exploded-cars</a></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It is vitally important that we help the local
reefs around these islands, because without them, the fish population will
diminish even further and the local fishing families will have less food. A
recent study of 200 Khmer families living on these islands showed that 17% of
them were not getting enough seafood to feed their families.</span><br/></p>
<p>The diving industry in Cambodia is also
growing which brings tourism to the local villages and its people. If there are
no healthy reefs or interesting artificial reefs for divers to look at, they
will stop coming, and everyone will lose out.</p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>Here’s where our funds will be spent:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Training local people and staff in how to build, maintain and
monitor Electro Reef structures - $3000</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Cost to build the new artificial Electro Reef structure -$4000 </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Titanium anode - $5000</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Other materials such epoxy resin, plastic tubing, wiring,
renewable energy source (solar power) and safety equipment - approximately
$2000.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>SCUBA diving manpower to help install the artificial reef with
diving equipment and boats - approximately $1000.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our final goal of $15,000
any funds raised will be used to create more natural artificial coral frames to
add to our already well-established coral nursery. From this coral nursery,
once the coral fragments are strong enough and healthy, we transplant them back
directly on to the natural reef where they once were.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Cambodia has never seen coral farming or
Electro Artificial reefs before. We have installed one lotus flower already on
a different island, which is still in the very early stages. We did this
without the help of Biorock, but this time we would like to bring in the
experts to help train us and ensure that our methods are correct. By doing this
we will also gain the support of another amazing non-profit organization who we
will work with on future projects together.</p>
<p>Your kind donations will make a massive impact
first and foremost to our local communities, but also to the diving industry in
general in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Our natural coral farms have had tremendous
success and excellent growth rates. Our Electro Reef systems should be able to
increase coral growth rates by 3-5 times.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The biggest risks that we face will be
accidental damage to our new artificial Electro Reef from boat anchors. We can
easily avoid this by marking out the area with bright marker buoys.</p>
<p>Another risk we face is utilizing solar panels
on the surface of the sea. We need to make sure that they are well anchored and
attached so they can’t be stolen or damaged by storms.</p>
<p>The structure will be placed quite close to
the local village where Save Cambodian Marine Life is based. That way we can
easily monitor it and visit it on a regular basis to ensure all the connections
are still intact.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

</div></div>","About Our Project
Save Cambodian Marine
Life is a non-profit
organization (NGO) based on Koh Rong Samloem, a small island off the coast of
Sihanoukville. Two of us started this project because we have a huge passion
for marine conservation and see a great need for it in this developing country.
I’m James. I’m a New Zealander who has lived here for almost 5 years. Pierre is
Cambodian born and is passionate about protecting his country’s natural resources
and educating fellow local people. Being Khmer and part of this cause is a
great asset as we hope other Cambodians will see this and want to take part to
protect their beautiful country. Our goals of this funding project are:
· 
To create artificial Electro Reef systems that help regenerate
reefs damaged by destructive fishing methods and anchor damage.
· 
To educate the local community about their reefs and how
important they are to a healthy ocean eco-system.We had an article written about us in the Phnom Penh post which you can read here: http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/electricity-broken-tanks-and-exploded-carsIt is vitally important that we help the local
reefs around these islands, because without them, the fish population will
diminish even further and the local fishing families will have less food. A
recent study of 200 Khmer families living on these islands showed that 17% of
them were not getting enough seafood to feed their families.
The diving industry in Cambodia is also
growing which brings tourism to the local villages and its people. If there are
no healthy reefs or interesting artificial reefs for divers to look at, they
will stop coming, and everyone will lose out.
What We Need 
Here’s where our funds will be spent:
· 
Training local people and staff in how to build, maintain and
monitor Electro Reef structures - $3000
· 
Cost to build the new artificial Electro Reef structure -$4000 
· 
Titanium anode - $5000
· 
Other materials such epoxy resin, plastic tubing, wiring,
renewable energy source (solar power) and safety equipment - approximately
$2000.
· 
SCUBA diving manpower to help install the artificial reef with
diving equipment and boats - approximately $1000.
If we do not reach our final goal of $15,000
any funds raised will be used to create more natural artificial coral frames to
add to our already well-established coral nursery. From this coral nursery,
once the coral fragments are strong enough and healthy, we transplant them back
directly on to the natural reef where they once were.
The Impact
Cambodia has never seen coral farming or
Electro Artificial reefs before. We have installed one lotus flower already on
a different island, which is still in the very early stages. We did this
without the help of Biorock, but this time we would like to bring in the
experts to help train us and ensure that our methods are correct. By doing this
we will also gain the support of another amazing non-profit organization who we
will work with on future projects together.
Your kind donations will make a massive impact
first and foremost to our local communities, but also to the diving industry in
general in Cambodia.
Our natural coral farms have had tremendous
success and excellent growth rates. Our Electro Reef systems should be able to
increase coral growth rates by 3-5 times.
Risks & Challenges
The biggest risks that we face will be
accidental damage to our new artificial Electro Reef from boat anchors. We can
easily avoid this by marking out the area with bright marker buoys.
Another risk we face is utilizing solar panels
on the surface of the sea. We need to make sure that they are well anchored and
attached so they can’t be stolen or damaged by storms.
The structure will be placed quite close to
the local village where Save Cambodian Marine Life is based. That way we can
easily monitor it and visit it on a regular basis to ensure all the connections
are still intact.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to help us with a fiscal
donation we understand. But if you believe in our project and the good work
that we are doing, please share and spread the word of our cause. The Indiegogo
sharing tools make it easy for you to share. We appreciate any help that we can

</p><p>Most of us at
least know the major challenges: air, soil and water pollution; nutrient-weak
food; over-expending of energy transporting food over long distances, and climate
changes. But it takes time to create food sources on our own properties, and not
everyone knows where to begin. And in our windy, cold-climate region we have a
short growing season—<u>only 2-1/2 to 3 months</u>. </p><p>
</p><p>To be successful, we must have a transformational shift in how we produce food. The intelligent
design and management of growing systems to support nature’s work is essential.
Creating sustainable ecosystems will help us, and the most successful change
comes from the bottom up. At PPI we are working to create a template for
natural food resilience in cold-climate regions. Using plant guilds, polycultures,
food forests and other permaculture methods, we are continuously amazed at what
you can <i>really grow</i> – increasing our
local food supply with a great abundance of food to be shared. <span>Planting in polycultures and food forests for many levels
of diversity allows us to create sustainable foodscapes for seven generations
into the future.</span></p><p>

</p><p>The
Rolling High Tunnel (RHT) Greenhouse will help us solve the challenges of our growing

</p><p>This
greenhouse is an important educational tool for PPI to share knowledge with
farmers, gardeners and students. It will allow us to grow a variety of
plantsmore effectively and efficiently by extending the growing season
on both ends. We plan to create a propagation environment for annuals and hardy
perennials to use in our classes and our <i><u>Paradise

local nurseries.</p><p>
</p><p>Because
local nurseries do not supply them, we lack access to good selections of

Many of the plants we would like to teach about, grow and use in local gardens
are expensive, and we realize that often people don’t have the funds to
purchase these for their yards. Some have to be specially ordered, because they
aren’t being propagated locally. That’s why we decided to grow and propagate
them at PPI. Mimicking nature’s diversity, bringing back some native species,
and planting for our climate will allow us to create foodscapes capable of
producing abundance for many generations to come. </p><p>
</p><p>A
specific educational objective is to demonstrate a sustainable, closed-loop food production
cycle: grow / harvest food / harvest seeds / plant seeds / grow again. We will also
offer classes on how to prepare the plants for use in nutritious meals, shakes,
and natural remedies.<span> And, since children enjoy the

from start to establishment or harvest. Let’s use vegetable crops as an
example. Start an early crop of lettuce in Position 1. Then, as spring weather
warms, raise the ends. Next, move into Position 2 for tomato transplants. In Position
3, fully expose hot-weather sun-loving herbs and vegetables while cucumbers and

</p><p>We
are focusing
on plants that work together in polycultures to support each other’s growth—clover,
hairy vetch, and lupine to fix nitrogen in the soil,
and dynamic accumulators such as comfrey, borage and yarrow. Planting
polycultures creates optimal conditions for plant diversity, adding what they
need, while monocultures (planting large areas with one crop) can take away.
Through considering each plant’s needs and the grouping it is placed in, we can
grow happy companions that support each other for higher yields, encourage
beneficial insects, and set the stage for nature to do the bulk of the work.

We at Paradise
Permaculture Institute (PPI) are a diverse group of professionals, amateurs,
and volunteers working to bring a wealth of edible plant species, growing and propagating
techniques, and season extension methods to gardeners, nurseries, our
supporters, and our communities.  We do
this by providing experiences, education, and demonstration sites to support
SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION. This
is our passion and maybe it’s yours too--or can be!
Our immediate
goal is to purchase a Rolling High Tunnel Greenhouse, which will enable
us to operate on a larger scale and supply many varieties of plants to fulfill
the growing needs of our programs, classes and demonstration sites. We will use
it to research, test, develop, and demonstrate methods to perpetuate growing
systems that mimic nature. These methods will produce food in foodscapes that
are abundant in cold climates and less labor-intensive…and will still produce abundance with climate
changes.
Because
of the work necessary to level and prepare the site, complete the greenhouse, prepare
beds, and get the project rolling, we are eager to begin soon. We hope to have
it in operation by August 22 of this year.DONATION QUICK-LINK: HIT THE ""BACK IT"" BUTTON ON THIS PAGE, OR CLICK HERE TO CONTRIBUTE. OR TO LEARN MORE FIRST, WE WELCOME YOU TO READ ON!  The transformation challenges facing our communities
Most of us at
least know the major challenges: air, soil and water pollution; nutrient-weak
food; over-expending of energy transporting food over long distances, and climate
changes. But it takes time to create food sources on our own properties, and not
everyone knows where to begin. And in our windy, cold-climate region we have a
short growing season—only 2-1/2 to 3 months. 
To be successful, we must have a transformational shift in how we produce food. The intelligent
design and management of growing systems to support nature’s work is essential.
Creating sustainable ecosystems will help us, and the most successful change
comes from the bottom up. At PPI we are working to create a template for
natural food resilience in cold-climate regions. Using plant guilds, polycultures,
food forests and other permaculture methods, we are continuously amazed at what
you can really grow – increasing our
local food supply with a great abundance of food to be shared. Planting in polycultures and food forests for many levels
of diversity allows us to create sustainable foodscapes for seven generations
into the future.
How we will use the Rolling High
Tunnel Greenhouse
The
Rolling High Tunnel (RHT) Greenhouse will help us solve the challenges of our growing
season. With
its capability and capacity, we can accelerate and expand our research. What we
learn will help others in our communities and anywhere else in the world with
similar climate and conditions. We are all in this together!A Rolling High Tunnel Greenhouse. 
This
greenhouse is an important educational tool for PPI to share knowledge with
farmers, gardeners and students. It will allow us to grow a variety of
plantsmore effectively and efficiently by extending the growing season
on both ends. We plan to create a propagation environment for annuals and hardy
perennials to use in our classes and our Paradise
Transition Gardens, and then share our results with the community and
local nurseries.
Because
local nurseries do not supply them, we lack access to good selections of
perennial edible species, native plants, and plants compatible with our climate.
Many of the plants we would like to teach about, grow and use in local gardens
are expensive, and we realize that often people don’t have the funds to
purchase these for their yards. Some have to be specially ordered, because they
aren’t being propagated locally. That’s why we decided to grow and propagate
them at PPI. Mimicking nature’s diversity, bringing back some native species,
and planting for our climate will allow us to create foodscapes capable of
producing abundance for many generations to come. 
A
specific educational objective is to demonstrate a sustainable, closed-loop food production
cycle: grow / harvest food / harvest seeds / plant seeds / grow again. We will also
offer classes on how to prepare the plants for use in nutritious meals, shakes,
and natural remedies. And, since children enjoy the
hands-on experience of smelling and touching the plants, we will provide
various community educational opportunities for them to be involved in
planting and harvesting.A RHT is a unique mobile greenhouse that can move on a track into 3 or more positions. The RHT features a high dome for maximum

There is no ""away."" Whatever we create, consume, and waste remains with us.  We have a choice about whether our ""waste"" has either detrimental or beneficial effects. To solve some of the world's most challenging environmental problems, we need solutions that see waste as a resource. We believe this change in perspective coupled with a systems approach to water, energy, and waste can have enormous beneficial impacts for people and the planet.   Our team spent nearly every waking moment of the last 6 years of our lives, approximately 394,200 hours, dedicated to developing our waste treatment technology.  We've had numerous successes and exceeded our expectations.  We figured out how to transform raw sewage into energy-positive clean water and carbon-negative, water-positive green fuels. In the process of growing biomass and turning it into fuel, we discovered something much more valuable. We can purify wastewater without wasting energy.We are excited about the viability of our technology and the benefits it can bring to a world where millions of children are killed every year by dirty water. However, our primary investor, a large Japanese corporation who initially funded our small startup, isn’t interested in wastewater.  They are no longer willing to provide funding to us as our interests no longer align.The truth is, we are in a tight spot. 
We have until Jan 31st (we received an extension from the previous Jan 17th date) to raise enough money to buy back our company and continue operating.  If we do not raise enough capital, our technology and IP will be shelved indefinitely, its benefits never brought to light. 
To our knowledge, there is no other process that can provide the benefits we can and do so at a profit. 
                    


We are in a position to invite people like you to help us continue developing our waste treatment system and deploy it at a commercial scale to bring its benefits to communities. 
Let's harness the power of the crowd to support existing technology and is so critically needed on this planet. We hope that you are inspired by our work and that you see the benefits it can provide.

  
WE KNOW IT WORKS!
In Alabama's Mobile Bay we successfully built and tested a demonstration facility that takes a community’s raw sewage into one end, and outputs carbon-negative fuel, clean water, and fertilizers from the other end.  Unlike most water treatment strategies our system generates energy while producing clean water. A community using this method could get energy back while treating their water.



Learn more about the science behind the system here.

STILL NOT CONVINCED?

Our planet is in need of help, and our cities are the places for transformation.  Did you know that some municipalities in the United States use up to 30-40% of total energy for water systems ( EPA)?  The clear message here is, we need more energy-friendly water production.  


On the flip side, we use about 40% of all water for fossil fuel energy production (DOE).  Negative implications of this practice include competition for water supplies among agricultural uses and human consumption. Additionally, warmed water coming out of thermoelectric plants has adverse impacts on local aquatic habitats. We need more water-friendly energy production.


The water-energy nexus is ripe for innovation to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and change the planet's future trajectory to a more stable climate. 

Algae Systems is a valid solution for a more resourceful water-energy nexus. You have the power to help us create a more sustainable world for future generations.


Algae Systems disrupts traditional wastewater treatment with a more resourceful, systems approach. Our technology pushes wastewater treatment and energy production into new territory that is far more beneficial for humans and other living systems than current practice.

create a product that would not only aid our family but reduce emissions each
day, one vehicle at a time, in order to help all those with breathing
problems.  AND WE HAVE CREATED THAT PRODUCT!</span></p>
<p>We
now have a new opportunity to help clean the air in Mexico <i>one power plant at a time</i>! 
The Mexican government is actively looking for environmentally friendly
products to improve air quality all across Mexico:</p>

<p> We
have been invited to demonstrate our products by the head of the Mexican Federal
Electricity Commission, (CFE ).<span>  Mexico uses
diesel fuel to operate over 600 power plants throughout the country.  The
Mexican government runs the CFE and has committed billions of dollars to reduce air pollution overall and
specifically reduce smoke and emissions caused by the power plants through out
Mexico.  They are extremely interested in purchasing our products and
would like a demonstration of our products with the expectation that we can
significantly improve air quality resulting in a better quality of life for the
people of Mexico.</span></p>
<p>We
believe our Unique EQ Product would reduce smoke and emissions coming from each
power plant by a minimum of 30%.<span>  This will
provide a huge impact on the air quality for the Mexican people.</span></p>
<p>Globally,
4.3 million deaths were attributable to household air pollution (HAP) in 2012,
almost all in low and middle income (LMI) countries according to: Public
Health, Social and Environmental Determinants of Health Department, World
Health Organization. </p>
<p><i>25
March 2014 | Geneva -</i> In new estimates released today, WHO
reports that in 2012 around 7 million people died - one in eight of total
global deaths – as a result of air pollution exposure. This finding more than
doubles previous estimates and confirms that air pollution is now the world’s
largest single environmental health risk. Reducing air pollution could save
millions of lives.</p>
<p>“The
risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or
understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,” says Dr Maria Neira,
Director of WHO’s Department for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants
of Health. “Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air
pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the
air we all breathe.”</p>

<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>EQ
is seeking $250,000 to do a complete demonstration showing how effective our product works.<span>  The demonstration will take place in
one or more power plants in Mexico.  This demonstration will allow us to
prove to the CFE that by using our products, they will not only save money
on fuel costs, but also save lives by lowering the amount of smoke and harmful
emissions that power plants put out each day.  </span></p>
<p>The
money raises will be used for travel to and from Mexico, for equipment development and deployment, and for
set up and monitoring of the demonstration.  We will also pay a 3<sup>rd</sup>
party (LAPEM) to verify our demonstration so the CFE knows that the test is
accurate and completely transparent.  The demonstration will take
approximately 30 days, and 5 staff members will be assigned for the
demonstration.  </p>
<p>We
are providing premiums and perks to our contributors.<span>  They range from our automotive product, EQ Mileage Booster in
a 12 pack, to a tour of one of the power plants in Mexico, along with
accommodations and a whale watching tour.</span></p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Using
our unique EQ products in power plants in Mexico and other countries will
have a global impact. By lowering emissions
in these facilities by at least 30%, we will be improving air quality and the
environment, giving all living things a better, healthier life.  Based on the current projections, 7 million people
lose their lives each year due to pollution. We have the opportunity to save over 2 million
of those people each year by simply reducing the amount of smoke and emissions
from Power Plants around the world.   Leaving the planet a cleaner, safer
place for our children and those that come long after we are gone is our goal
at EnergyQuest.  EQ is only one way to help with the massive problem of creating
a cleaner, safer environment.  So if helping EQ is not your thing, please
find something that is unique and needs your support to help make Planet Earth
a better place to live.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Our
biggest challenge is convincing people and organizations that they should be
concerned about the environmental crisis that we have created over the last
century.  Massive pollution and global warming affects everyone, and it’s
time everyone pitched in.  Marketing our product to individuals who can
only change one vehicle at a time has been difficult, but marketing and selling our product to a
Government agency, CFE, that has thousands of power plants across Mexico is an achievement that will make a difference globally. </p>
<p>During
the last election in Mexico, the CFE and Mexican Government officials were
elected by the Green Party, which seeks to improve the quality of life for
those in Mexico.  It also doesn’t hurt that by using our EQ additive in
the fuel that operates the power plants, there will be a substantial financial
savings to the CFE and the Government.  By using our unique EQ product, the
CFE will use less fuel and have less maintenance issues on their equipment,
which brings them even greater savings.  </p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>

quality is safe enough to allow them to go outside.  So we set out to
create a product that would not only aid our family but reduce emissions each
day, one vehicle at a time, in order to help all those with breathing
problems.  AND WE HAVE CREATED THAT PRODUCT!
We
now have a new opportunity to help clean the air in Mexico one power plant at a time! 
The Mexican government is actively looking for environmentally friendly
products to improve air quality all across Mexico:
Mexico News: Government to Invest $32B to Slash
Greenhouse Gases Emissions

 We
have been invited to demonstrate our products by the head of the Mexican Federal
Electricity Commission, (CFE ).  Mexico uses
diesel fuel to operate over 600 power plants throughout the country.  The
Mexican government runs the CFE and has committed billions of dollars to reduce air pollution overall and
specifically reduce smoke and emissions caused by the power plants through out
Mexico.  They are extremely interested in purchasing our products and
would like a demonstration of our products with the expectation that we can
significantly improve air quality resulting in a better quality of life for the
people of Mexico.
We
believe our Unique EQ Product would reduce smoke and emissions coming from each
power plant by a minimum of 30%.  This will
provide a huge impact on the air quality for the Mexican people.
Globally,
4.3 million deaths were attributable to household air pollution (HAP) in 2012,
almost all in low and middle income (LMI) countries according to: Public
Health, Social and Environmental Determinants of Health Department, World
Health Organization. 
25
March 2014 | Geneva - In new estimates released today, WHO
reports that in 2012 around 7 million people died - one in eight of total
global deaths – as a result of air pollution exposure. This finding more than
doubles previous estimates and confirms that air pollution is now the world’s
largest single environmental health risk. Reducing air pollution could save
millions of lives.
“The
risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or
understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,” says Dr Maria Neira,
Director of WHO’s Department for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants
of Health. “Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air
pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the
air we all breathe.”
These short videos from reputable sources
around the world explain that we truly have a world wide problem coming from
Power Plants.  Please take a look at just a few of the 1000's of videos that
can be found on the internet :

What
We Need & What You Get
EQ
is seeking $250,000 to do a complete demonstration showing how effective our product works.  The demonstration will take place in
one or more power plants in Mexico.  This demonstration will allow us to
prove to the CFE that by using our products, they will not only save money
on fuel costs, but also save lives by lowering the amount of smoke and harmful
emissions that power plants put out each day.  
The
money raises will be used for travel to and from Mexico, for equipment development and deployment, and for
set up and monitoring of the demonstration.  We will also pay a 3rd
party (LAPEM) to verify our demonstration so the CFE knows that the test is
accurate and completely transparent.  The demonstration will take
approximately 30 days, and 5 staff members will be assigned for the
demonstration.  
We
are providing premiums and perks to our contributors.  They range from our automotive product, EQ Mileage Booster in
a 12 pack, to a tour of one of the power plants in Mexico, along with
accommodations and a whale watching tour.
The
Impact
Using
our unique EQ products in power plants in Mexico and other countries will
have a global impact. By lowering emissions
in these facilities by at least 30%, we will be improving air quality and the
environment, giving all living things a better, healthier life.  Based on the current projections, 7 million people
lose their lives each year due to pollution. We have the opportunity to save over 2 million
of those people each year by simply reducing the amount of smoke and emissions
from Power Plants around the world.   Leaving the planet a cleaner, safer
place for our children and those that come long after we are gone is our goal
at EnergyQuest.  EQ is only one way to help with the massive problem of creating
a cleaner, safer environment.  So if helping EQ is not your thing, please
find something that is unique and needs your support to help make Planet Earth
a better place to live.
Risks
& Challenges
Our
biggest challenge is convincing people and organizations that they should be
concerned about the environmental crisis that we have created over the last
century.  Massive pollution and global warming affects everyone, and it’s
time everyone pitched in.  Marketing our product to individuals who can
only change one vehicle at a time has been difficult, but marketing and selling our product to a
Government agency, CFE, that has thousands of power plants across Mexico is an achievement that will make a difference globally. 
During
the last election in Mexico, the CFE and Mexican Government officials were
elected by the Green Party, which seeks to improve the quality of life for
those in Mexico.  It also doesn’t hurt that by using our EQ additive in
the fuel that operates the power plants, there will be a substantial financial
savings to the CFE and the Government.  By using our unique EQ product, the
CFE will use less fuel and have less maintenance issues on their equipment,
which brings them even greater savings.

<p>Since the early years of this

<p>Neonicotinoids, or “neonics” for
short, are a group of synthetic neurotoxin pesticides. Since the introduction
of neonics as chemical pesticides, bee populations have plummeted. In spite of the myriad scientific studies tying
neonics to bee decline, they are still present in the majority of plants sold
in the United States, as well as many seeds and planting soils.<br/>
<br/>
And this catastrophic loss of bees has severe implications not only in terms of
biodiversity, but also for us. Neonicotinoids have been tied to birth defects
and neurological disorders, as well as water pollution and loss of food
security. Bees pollinate over $20 billion of U.S. crops every year (which means
that you can thank a bee for every third bite of food that you take). If we keep
losing bees, both human and animal food supply is at serious risk. No bees, no
food.</p>
<p>Bees are like the storied canary in
the coal mine; their death tells us that our shared environment has become
toxic. But unlike the miners who fled the mine when their canaries died, we
cannot flee, for we—like the bees—live in this mine: it is our global
environment.<br/><br/></p>

households to pledge to not use neonicotinoid pesticides, or plants which have

<h4>Working with School Groups: </h4>
<p>The youth are our future, and it is of the utmost importance that they realize their vital place in the mission to save the bees. Recently we've done work with several student groups including the Fairview High School Net
Zero Environmental Group in Boulder. These amazing students have spoken at Boulder City Council
and other city-wide events with Bee Safe Boulder, and are remarkable activists for the environment and bees. On Earth Day, we also had the opportunity to send volunteers and
bee-safe materials to elementary schools around Boulder County. We're excited
to expand our educational mission and get more youth involved!</p>

<h4><b>Outreach:</b></h4>There are now eight official Bee Safe Neighborhoods and

County and other parts of the United States. One of the most impressive things-
all of this was completed in the past year.<br/><p></p>

<h3><b>Collaboration</b></h3>
Bee Safe Boulder works with businesses, schools, and other government and

<p><b></b></p>
<h4><b>Retailers &amp; Businesses:</b></h4>Bee Safe Boulder has secured pledges from local
retailers, landscapers, and lawn care and tree companies to not sell
contaminated plants, bulbs, trees, turf, and topical garden products that
contain neonics, or, if they must sell these products, to label anything that
does contain them.<br/>
<br/>
We have also contacted nurseries and other growers up the wholesale supply line
to secure neonic-free plants for our pledged companies. 33 companies so far
have pledged and are making this transition! Local Colorado growers have jumped
on the bandwagon in response to consumer demand; we are changing how businesses
think about the environment, and about their ability and responsibility to make
important change.<p></p>

powerful means to bring about change. We learned that neighbors talking to
neighbors leads to the kind of communication and education that can bring about
real change. 

Education

Working with School Groups: 
The youth are our future, and it is of the utmost importance that they realize their vital place in the mission to save the bees. Recently we've done work with several student groups including the Fairview High School Net
Zero Environmental Group in Boulder. These amazing students have spoken at Boulder City Council
and other city-wide events with Bee Safe Boulder, and are remarkable activists for the environment and bees. On Earth Day, we also had the opportunity to send volunteers and
bee-safe materials to elementary schools around Boulder County. We're excited
to expand our educational mission and get more youth involved!


Outreach:There are now eight official Bee Safe Neighborhoods and
smaller Bee Safe Communities. Around 50 neighborhoods are in process in Boulder
County and other parts of the United States. One of the most impressive things-
all of this was completed in the past year.

Collaboration
Bee Safe Boulder works with businesses, schools, and other government and
private organizations.

Retailers & Businesses:Bee Safe Boulder has secured pledges from local
retailers, landscapers, and lawn care and tree companies to not sell
contaminated plants, bulbs, trees, turf, and topical garden products that
contain neonics, or, if they must sell these products, to label anything that
does contain them.

We have also contacted nurseries and other growers up the wholesale supply line
to secure neonic-free plants for our pledged companies. 33 companies so far
have pledged and are making this transition! Local Colorado growers have jumped
on the bandwagon in response to consumer demand; we are changing how businesses
think about the environment, and about their ability and responsibility to make
important change.
We are empowering citizens to change
their neighborhoods and their cities too! Here is a sticker from a local
business:


After BSB informed them of the dangers of neonics, McGuckin Hardware put these labels on all plants containing neonicotinoids. 

City Government:We asked our local Boulder City Council to pass a
Resolution banning the use of neonics on city property: to become a ""Bee
Safe City."" They enthusiastically took up the challenge, and on May 5,
2015, coinciding with the launch of this campaign, Resolution #1159,
""A Resolution Concerning the Use of Neonicontinoid Pesticides in the City
of Boulder,"" was passed by a unanimous vote city council.



BSB Co-Founder Molly Greacen speaking at City County as Resolution #1159 is passedVolunteers:We have over 100 volunteers in Boulder County who are
working restlessly to create Bee Safe neighborhoods, reach out to garden supply
retailers, and otherwise keep this organization successful and buzzing.

Advisory Board:Bee Safe Boulder collaborated with an advisory
board made up of a variety of educated and productive members. We are working
diligently to be inclusive, organized, energetic, and intelligent about how to
tackle the various obstacles that we meet on our journey to a bee-safe city.


Partners:BSB also partners with a variety of both local and
national organizations, including Boulder Rights of Nature, Beyond Pesticides,
the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, Beyond Toxics, the Xerces Society, and
both the Boulder County and Colorado Beekeepers Associations, to work toward
elimination in of neonics and other pesticide use.
What We Need:
Bee Safe Boulder needs to raise
$25,000, one dollar for each species of bee, in order to hire a part-time
community and volunteer organizer, who can help us continue our critical work
with local businesses in Boulder County, continue our outreach efforts, and
fund special projects, such as those mentioned below. With your help, we will
make not only Boulder, but the whole nation bee safe.





Closing:

Bee Safe Boulder has created a
national conversation about changing pesticide use on lawns and gardens in this
country.  We have established a new path to a bright future, but we cannot
do it alone anymore.
Donate today to make the movement
move and #beethechange.
