<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>I have been writing more or less my whole life, whether about my dreams of walking on another planet's surface or my own take on the adventures of my childhood heroes (as seen on Star Trek, Doctor Who or old Superman comics). As I grew older my interest in original stories grew (due to some urging from primary school teachers) and I began working on concepts for a novel in Grade 9. </p>
<p>""The Last Seven Days"" has been constantly evolving and changing since then. At first it was a comical superhero romp called ""The Diamond Dogs"" (the David Bowie references didn't end there) starring three teenagers on a quest to save the world. Since then it has evolved into a much more complex tale, for a time taking the form of a 100'000 word-long two part novel named ""Nucleus"", which was ultimately split in half to form ""The Last Seven Days"" and it's prospective follow-up, which is currently unnamed. </p>
<p>""The Last Seven Days"" is about 80'000 words long. It details the friendships of the four teenagers as well as the increasingly hostile situations they face, and focuses on themes of trust, friendship and morality. </p>
<h2>What Is Needed? </h2>
<p>The world of publishing is a somewhat daunting one, and because of this I have opted for self publishing, which presents itself with its own challenges. The world of self-publishing is not a cheap one, which makes a lot of sense really given the number of things that need attending to before the book reaches the shelves (or e-book stores for that matter). This being said, there are many expenses that need covering to get this book out into the open, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing costs for both hardcover and paperback editions</li>
<li>Distribution to stores, both online and in-store</li>
<li>Copyright registration</li>
<li>Editor's fee</li>
<li>Cover design fee</li>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Firstly, if you cannot help, please don't fret. I know exactly what it is like to be short on funds. I've been there since maybe 1990. And this campaign explicitly betrays the hollow state of my coffers. But if you cannot help, I do ask that you pass on this campaign to someone you know who can help or might just be interested in reading my story.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Second, I'm doing this as a 28-day funder, because monies can be delayed getting to me for up to 15 days after the campaign end and I'm on a very tight schedule -- I have to leave for Ireland on July 9 in order for this all to come together. <b>And since I'm doing this as a fixed campaign, not a flexible one, I won't receive a dime unless this is fully funded - if it doesn't hit, you get your pledge back, in full.</b><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've been invited to read fiction in Bantry, Ireland at the <a href=""http://www.westcorkmusic.ie/literaryfestival/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">West Cork Literary Festival</a>, which, in part, will occasion the launch of a book from <a href=""http://www.fishpublishing.com/2015-short-long-lists.php#wff15"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fish Publishing</a> in which I will be published. My story, as one of the top 10 from 1285 global entries (yep, less than 1% were winners) will be put into good 'ole paper form alongside dozens of other writers who also placed in the various contests that Fish holds each year in fiction and poetry.

</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've set up perks off to the right as specific incentives for this campaign, but you have the ability to contribute any other amount you'd like just for the heck of it.

If you think the perks would be interesting to someone you know, buy one as a gift for a writer friend or family member.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">What follows is the whole lowdown on why I've set up this crowdfunder. It's unlike me to do this because I find it difficult to ask for assistance when there are plenty of other people and causes to reward. But this opportunity is, without question, one of the most important things that has (nearly) happened to me. Will you help me get rid of the nearly?</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<h3>1. My story</h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've always wanted a mentor, a fiction writer of some acclaim who would take me under his or her wing to guide me on the creative journey I've taken as my life's calling. This is something that really no longer occurs and hasn't in traditional terms for many many decades, at least within the realm of fiction writing. So, I write in a vacuum and read a great deal to find mentors on my bookshelves. I'm hoping that as you read a bit about what I am trying to do with this campaign to ask for your hard-earned money that you each become a virtual mentor to me through your generosity. Nothing would mean more than to know that the people who support me now do so because they believe there is a wispy possibility that my stories have staying power.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've been writing for a long time -- I remember penning stories when I was about ten years old. So, that makes it nearly 37 years that I have been trying to craft fiction that someone will read and find a bit of value in. I'll keep doing it till the day I die because I find great joy in it and a way for me to engage with the world that truly feels worthwhile.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've had my share of minor successes --- two dozen small publications in the last ten years, but it is only recently that the tide is slowly turning my way. </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A summary of recent high points with my writing that have given me some much needed hope to press on.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">First - The story that placed in the Fish Publishing contest, as I wrote about above.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Second - </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Last year I placed in a contest held by a journal called </span><a href=""https://www.sixfold.org/FicWinter14/Sutz.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">Sixfold</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. This is a contest in which fellow entrants read and judge your story for advancement through three rounds. So, if your story went through to the 3rd round, it was read by around 60 writers cumulatively. My story, Permaville, is one that I entered into two times in Sixfold (they hold the contest three or four times  year) and honed it with each previous failure. Fortunately, I received ongoing commentary throughout the year that helped illuminate the story's strengths and weaknesses. On this last successful round, I receive the type of comments and feedback that writers dream of when crafting a story in their writing caves. Many of the comments on the story echoed a feeling I'd long held about the piece -- that it could likely be turned into a novel. So, that is what I've been concentrating on for the best part of the last half year. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I'm on my way with it and think it will take another six months or so to have a working, complete manuscript that might be salable both as a novel and as a possible movie. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Part of my trip to Cork will be doling out hardcopy manuscripts of 50 pages of the novel to agents and editors who will be present at the festival. It will provide me a good chance to take advantage of both a captive and kindred audience. Who knows what could happen if the right person takes a liking to my story?</span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Third - <span style=""background-color: initial;"">This year I won the inaugural contest for writers that the Tempe Public Library sponsored. My category was Adult Fiction and I won for a story called Spare Parts (read it <a href=""http://www.tempe.gov/home/showdocument?id=32061"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>). The video at the beginning of this page is me reading in front of a 100+ people who attended the reading on April 1. Fortunately, my cousin Michael happened to be in town with his wife and kids on a vacation. He's a professional documentary filmmaker and offered to tape my reading. He's very good at what he does and I was so thankful to have this event now permanently recorded.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>Winning this contest was a total surprise and gave me the kind of energy I cannot recall ever receiving during my life as a writer. I took a chance to submit a short story that I loved and had worked hard on but wasn't really sure had any legs. The honor of being chosen by local peers is immeasurable. The two leaders of this effort - Jill Brenner, Adult Services Librarian at the Tempe Public Library and Jeanne Hanrahan, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Liaison, University Academic Success Programs Administration at ASU - put in a herculean effort to ensure that this first-ever event was a rousing success.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I was honored to learn that I am part of a community of writers that is passionate, devoted, and runs from high-school age to retirees. Tempe has some serious writing talent.</span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>2. How much is it going to cost? The breakdown</h3>
<div>The straight poop on how much money it will take to make this trip possible and not return with the kind of throat-clenching stress that makes me wonder why on earth I ever went in the first place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Airfaire from Phoenix to Shannon - $1700</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Bus fares from Shannon to Bantry and back; and public transport while in Bantry for the week - $200</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hotel or Airbnb - $1000 for 8 nights (not sure which yet, but pricing is equivalent)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sustenance - $250</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Indiegogo Expenses (transfer fees, wire fees, their cut) - $500</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mobile phone premium charges while overseas - $100 (as much texting as possible, as little calling)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Two Guinnesses per day, with proper tips (it's Ireland, folks) - $100</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Miscellaneous incidentals (I haven't a clue yet, but they always arise, don't they?) - $500</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Approximately 1/2 of the wages I'll miss while gone for half a month - (this will partially help me avoid the above-mentioned throat-clenching stress)- $650</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Total - $5000</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If it pans out beyond my expectations, each $500 that I hit above the goal will allow me to devote a minimum of 40 hours per week exclusively to finishing the manuscript of my novel, which ultimately would help me take a real stab at securing an agent (maybe the one I met in Bantry) and making a real go at being a working creative writer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Also, though I'm not going nuts here and figuring tax implications into this, next year this money I raise will be counted as income and be taxed similarly as my current freelance work. So, next year I'll be paying in the vicinity of $1,000 to $2,000 in taxes on this. There is no way around this and no way for me to avoid it, but I'm not going to outthink the process and try to figure taxes into the funds I'm seeking. I consider this opportunity worthy of the tax burden next year.</div>

</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I work as a freelance writer, primarily composing resumes for people in a variety of industries. I also work as an editor and take on any job that comes my way involving improved written communication. I work as a contract worker, so pay all taxes out of my own pocket. This includes a hefty self-employment tax each year. For every dollar I earn, at the end of the taxes and incidentals, I keep about 65 cents. So, it is a tight living. And especially when this living is unsteady. In the last year alone, I've gone three sets of 2-4 weeks with zero income because of lack of work. It gets dry sometimes.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I live frugally - not much, if anything, is left at the end of each month with school loans and monthly living expenses and credit card debt and car insurance and fixits (when the car works) and medical expenses out of pocket (I can't yet afford to pay insurance premiums - dental yes, but medical is a few hundred extra per month). The most luxurious thing I do lately is coffee out - this is primarily for me to reengage with human beings after writing resumes and my own fiction for upwards of 12 hours a day, seven days a week.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Thank you</h3> <p>I really appreciate the time you've taken to read the story of my campaign.</p>
<p>If you're going to become a contributor, welcome aboard.</p>
<p>If not, cheers for reading this and for passing it on to someone you know who may be interested in helping out.</p>
<p><br/></p></div>","The quick summary

Firstly, if you cannot help, please don't fret. I know exactly what it is like to be short on funds. I've been there since maybe 1990. And this campaign explicitly betrays the hollow state of my coffers. But if you cannot help, I do ask that you pass on this campaign to someone you know who can help or might just be interested in reading my story.


Second, I'm doing this as a 28-day funder, because monies can be delayed getting to me for up to 15 days after the campaign end and I'm on a very tight schedule -- I have to leave for Ireland on July 9 in order for this all to come together. And since I'm doing this as a fixed campaign, not a flexible one, I won't receive a dime unless this is fully funded - if it doesn't hit, you get your pledge back, in full.


I've been invited to read fiction in Bantry, Ireland at the West Cork Literary Festival, which, in part, will occasion the launch of a book from Fish Publishing in which I will be published. My story, as one of the top 10 from 1285 global entries (yep, less than 1% were winners) will be put into good 'ole paper form alongside dozens of other writers who also placed in the various contests that Fish holds each year in fiction and poetry. They were nice enough to invite me, along with the other finalists, but it is up to me to spring for the trip. During this festival, many agents and publishers and writers and book lovers are in attendance and I'm hoping to take the manuscript of the novel I'm working on (read below) and pass it on to a few parties who might fall in love with it. 


I've set up perks off to the right as specific incentives for this campaign, but you have the ability to contribute any other amount you'd like just for the heck of it. Want to send me a million bucks? Go for it. I'll contact you after I pick myself up off the floor. If you think the perks would be interesting to someone you know, buy one as a gift for a writer friend or family member.


What follows is the whole lowdown on why I've set up this crowdfunder. It's unlike me to do this because I find it difficult to ask for assistance when there are plenty of other people and causes to reward. But this opportunity is, without question, one of the most important things that has (nearly) happened to me. Will you help me get rid of the nearly?


1. My story

I've always wanted a mentor, a fiction writer of some acclaim who would take me under his or her wing to guide me on the creative journey I've taken as my life's calling. This is something that really no longer occurs and hasn't in traditional terms for many many decades, at least within the realm of fiction writing. So, I write in a vacuum and read a great deal to find mentors on my bookshelves. I'm hoping that as you read a bit about what I am trying to do with this campaign to ask for your hard-earned money that you each become a virtual mentor to me through your generosity. Nothing would mean more than to know that the people who support me now do so because they believe there is a wispy possibility that my stories have staying power.


I've been writing for a long time -- I remember penning stories when I was about ten years old. So, that makes it nearly 37 years that I have been trying to craft fiction that someone will read and find a bit of value in. I'll keep doing it till the day I die because I find great joy in it and a way for me to engage with the world that truly feels worthwhile.

I've had my share of minor successes --- two dozen small publications in the last ten years, but it is only recently that the tide is slowly turning my way. 

A summary of recent high points with my writing that have given me some much needed hope to press on.

First - The story that placed in the Fish Publishing contest, as I wrote about above.


Second - Last year I placed in a contest held by a journal called Sixfold. This is a contest in which fellow entrants read and judge your story for advancement through three rounds. So, if your story went through to the 3rd round, it was read by around 60 writers cumulatively. My story, Permaville, is one that I entered into two times in Sixfold (they hold the contest three or four times  year) and honed it with each previous failure. Fortunately, I received ongoing commentary throughout the year that helped illuminate the story's strengths and weaknesses. On this last successful round, I receive the type of comments and feedback that writers dream of when crafting a story in their writing caves. Many of the comments on the story echoed a feeling I'd long held about the piece -- that it could likely be turned into a novel. So, that is what I've been concentrating on for the best part of the last half year. I'm on my way with it and think it will take another six months or so to have a working, complete manuscript that might be salable both as a novel and as a possible movie. Part of my trip to Cork will be doling out hardcopy manuscripts of 50 pages of the novel to agents and editors who will be present at the festival. It will provide me a good chance to take advantage of both a captive and kindred audience. Who knows what could happen if the right person takes a liking to my story?


Third - This year I won the inaugural contest for writers that the Tempe Public Library sponsored. My category was Adult Fiction and I won for a story called Spare Parts (read it here). The video at the beginning of this page is me reading in front of a 100+ people who attended the reading on April 1. Fortunately, my cousin Michael happened to be in town with his wife and kids on a vacation. He's a professional documentary filmmaker and offered to tape my reading. He's very good at what he does and I was so thankful to have this event now permanently recorded.


Winning this contest was a total surprise and gave me the kind of energy I cannot recall ever receiving during my life as a writer. I took a chance to submit a short story that I loved and had worked hard on but wasn't really sure had any legs. The honor of being chosen by local peers is immeasurable. The two leaders of this effort - Jill Brenner, Adult Services Librarian at the Tempe Public Library and Jeanne Hanrahan, Liaison, University Academic Success Programs Administration at ASU - put in a herculean effort to ensure that this first-ever event was a rousing success.


I was honored to learn that I am part of a community of writers that is passionate, devoted, and runs from high-school age to retirees. Tempe has some serious writing talent.

2. How much is it going to cost? The breakdown
The straight poop on how much money it will take to make this trip possible and not return with the kind of throat-clenching stress that makes me wonder why on earth I ever went in the first place.

Airfaire from Phoenix to Shannon - $1700

Bus fares from Shannon to Bantry and back; and public transport while in Bantry for the week - $200

Hotel or Airbnb - $1000 for 8 nights (not sure which yet, but pricing is equivalent)

Sustenance - $250

Indiegogo Expenses (transfer fees, wire fees, their cut) - $500

Mobile phone premium charges while overseas - $100 (as much texting as possible, as little calling)

Two Guinnesses per day, with proper tips (it's Ireland, folks) - $100

Miscellaneous incidentals (I haven't a clue yet, but they always arise, don't they?) - $500

Approximately 1/2 of the wages I'll miss while gone for half a month - (this will partially help me avoid the above-mentioned throat-clenching stress)- $650

Total - $5000

If it pans out beyond my expectations, each $500 that I hit above the goal will allow me to devote a minimum of 40 hours per week exclusively to finishing the manuscript of my novel, which ultimately would help me take a real stab at securing an agent (maybe the one I met in Bantry) and making a real go at being a working creative writer.

Also, though I'm not going nuts here and figuring tax implications into this, next year this money I raise will be counted as income and be taxed similarly as my current freelance work. So, next year I'll be paying in the vicinity of $1,000 to $2,000 in taxes on this. There is no way around this and no way for me to avoid it, but I'm not going to outthink the process and try to figure taxes into the funds I'm seeking. I consider this opportunity worthy of the tax burden next year.


3. What I do now (aka, Why I need your help)



I work as a freelance writer, primarily composing resumes for people in a variety of industries. I also work as an editor and take on any job that comes my way involving improved written communication. I work as a contract worker, so pay all taxes out of my own pocket. This includes a hefty self-employment tax each year. For every dollar I earn, at the end of the taxes and incidentals, I keep about 65 cents. So, it is a tight living. And especially when this living is unsteady. In the last year alone, I've gone three sets of 2-4 weeks with zero income because of lack of work. It gets dry sometimes.


I live frugally - not much, if anything, is left at the end of each month with school loans and monthly living expenses and credit card debt and car insurance and fixits (when the car works) and medical expenses out of pocket (I can't yet afford to pay insurance premiums - dental yes, but medical is a few hundred extra per month). The most luxurious thing I do lately is coffee out - this is primarily for me to reengage with human beings after writing resumes and my own fiction for upwards of 12 hours a day, seven days a week.

Thank you I really appreciate the time you've taken to read the story of my campaign.
If you're going to become a contributor, welcome aboard.
If not, cheers for reading this and for passing it on to someone you know who may be interested in helping out.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Risks, Challenges & Rewards
 
We need to raise enough funding to get Don't Eat the Cat Food! published and distributed. We've chosen to publish through WestBow Press, a self-publishing arm of HarperCollins Christian Publishing (which owns Thomas Nelson and Zondervan). To publish, market and distribute will take at least $5,000. 

All gifts will be tithed upon. At least 10 percent of the gross proceeds from the project will go to a wonderful organization called But God Ministries, supporting work in Haiti.
Some have asked what will happen if we don't raise the goal. The answer is nothing. In the event that we don't raise the full amount needed, your contribution will be refunded, and we will figure out another way to publish the book.
Here is our budget (assuming we raise $5,000):

Tithe: $500.00. This represents our commitment to give back a portion of what we have been given. 10% of all receipts will be given to But God Ministries, helping care for people in Haiti.

Crowdfunding Expenses: $450.00. Indiegogo (consistent with most other crowdfunding sites) charges a fee of 5%, plus variable fees which probably add up to about 4%, for a total of 9%. (This is a loose estimate.)

Publication: $1,999.00 (plus tax). Westbow Press will be doing the actual publication, from editing to design of the book itself, as well as marketing and getting the book to distribution points.

Taxes: $1,000.00. Uncle Sam will get his share. Amounts donated to a crowdfunding campaign are taxable. The actual amount will vary, but we're setting aside 20% to be on the safe side.


Order fulfillment, marketing, and support: $1,051.00. That money will be used to buy and ship books, fulfill our perk obligations and get the word out about the book.

Anything left from $5,000 goal will be placed into an account to defray project-related expenses.

<p>FAQ
</p>
<p><b>What about shipping?
</b></p>
<p>Shipping is always tricky as rates differ and
change over time but we estimate that it
will cost 10 USD within the US and Europe
(UK, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Austria,
Germany, Netherlands and Belgium) and 15
USD to the rest of the World. We can’t
know yet if the oil price is stable, but we’ll
look forward to archive the best rates for
you.
</p>
<p><b>What you are mean with havoc
recovered documents?
</b></p>
<p>These documents are recovered or printed
copies of any kind of digital communication
from the past of the project. Those will be
inserted as an inlay in the book. Later on
you can use it as a communication
template for any kind of business --from
the craftsmen up to the ministries. You will
find documents for inquire subsidies and
how you can grant the copyrights (for e.g.
your package design) from Apple, Google,
Samsung, Chevrolet, Segway, Mercedes
Benz and many more without paying any

Kill the Game Changer is an illustrated
book with unveiled images and unlocked
documents of my project RAWLEMON --that
have been wildfire across the internet in the
last few years-- to establish transparent
solar power robots in the field of energy. 






WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK AND THIS
CAMPAIGN AWESOME?

A few things about the REMATCH:

IF YOU LIKE OUR PLANET:

My friend and my hidden friends: it is as
awesome at it looks as a sci-fi novel, but
it's a running never-ending story in real
time on a key market and to tackle climate
change. Now you're playing the character
of the most important investor --in the field
of energy-- for the welfare of the citizen.
Also unlike a supporter for micro financing -
- you get to fight CRACKERS and HACKERS.
With ALGORITHMS over social media
networks. Be the loveliest HACKER on the
PLANET and save together a patent that
can change the world! 








IF YOU HATE OUR PLANET BUT STILL YOU
HAVE TO LIVE ON HIM:

You won't hate him anymore. Honest! This
is a great documentary --guiding you step
by step straight towards the SUN-- in a
friendly illustrated format. If you ever have
wondering what people's motivations were
in the play of ENERGY, you will totally
understand why OIL, COAL, NUCLEAR, GAS
is the greatest resource to be the most
powerful GAMER on the planet. But I'll warn
you: ENERGY GAMER are soft players with
stunning hardware effects. So if you want
to see the secret path of the GAME, you can
enter as a GHOST (Ghosts don't die!
Shakespeare wrote this and Ryan North did
an amazing update on this) on your own
adventure.









IF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN PLANETARY
AT ALL BUT LIKE FUNNY JOKES:

Then I can assure you this book is still
totally awesome and chock full of those
things you like. I've selected some
comments out of thousands that are taking
crazy directions with the story. You can
love or hate it. This book is written full of
inventions to play with GIANTS and
TECHNOLOGIES at day and night, and you
can enter at this point as the NUCLEAR
POPE. 







IF YOU DON'T LIKE BOOKS AT ALL BUT
CAMPAIGN SPECIALS:

Then you can do something very special
within the duration of this CAMPAIGN. Your
JOB is to find the POPE and to offer him my
PATENT RIGHTS as a GIFT. I will be
amazed to give him the rights to tackle the
CLIMATE CHANGE tomorrow.












TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE BOOK!

The book itself is already written up to the
end of milestone ONE. 40,000 words of
stunning industrial comedy and havoc
recovered documents that I lovingly crafted
together myself over the past year.
Milestone one covers round about half time
of the whole story and finish in New York
City at the 23th level at Wall Street with an
important MESSAGE -- that opens book two
with milestone TWO. And soon, thanks to
your help this book one will be available in
an edited and professional polished version
-- ready to be sent to the printers.










We are going to decide how amazing this
book is going to be and how we polish book
TWO. As it is a never-ending story, the
more money we raise, the better the books
will be. Digital, Paperbacks and hardcovers
are given, but we'll also be adding pictures
and documents. And not just any pictures
and documents: Unveiled pictures from the
project and powerful documents of powerful
people and organization’s. Look at all these
amazing people from book ONE:

hunting lodge at Lintalee in <span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedburgh"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>Jedburgh</span></b></a></span>
forest.
Arundel thought it would be
a good idea to send a force of several thousand axe-wielding men-at-arms to
dismantle the new hunting lodge.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the time James Douglas had barely fifty mounted men at his
disposal, along with several companies of archers drawn from the nearby Douglas
lands. An ambush was clearly in order and as Arundel's force
approached Douglas ordered his men to lash together the trees and thickets on
either side of a narrow point on the road.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The army of woodcutters advanced into the ambush, which
Douglas triggered by leading his knights on a charge at the English vanguard.
There may have been relatively few mounted Scottish knights, but funnelling
them into a road and charging at full speed resulted in a pile driving effect.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>The English vanguard couldn’t back up or escape to either
side and the Scottish knights’ momentum placed a formidable bottleneck in the
only available road. As a result, Douglas' archers simply set about pouring
arrows into the largely immobilised English column.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, three hundred of the English troops had taken a different
route and stumbled upon Douglas' generously provisioned but unoccupied lodge.
Believing themselves safe in the knowledge that Douglas would either be defeated
or at the very least delayed at length, the English soldiers settled down to
enjoy a meal. </p>
<p>It wasn't a meal they had time to savour, as Douglas had
identified Sir Thomas Richmond as the commander of the English forces on the
ground during the Scots’ initial charge.</p>
<p>As the two forces clashed, Douglas leapt straight from
his own horse on to Sir Thomas with a dagger at the ready.</p>
<p>Having stabbed the unfortunate Sir Thomas to death with the
dagger, Douglas then claimed the English knight's fur hat as a trophy - which
probably helped to further demoralise the already struggling English force.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Consequently, the battle was over almost as soon as it had
started and Douglas went straight back to his lodge. Few, if any, of the band
of feasting English soldiers survived his return.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The feedback on the trial text was consistently good. which comes across as an encouragement to add key features and characters skipped at the first attempt. In particular, the one text revised to two texts uses more intense images, adds quotes from original documents, covers the early rebellion more fully and includes more personal stories.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The work involved is all known territory. I've 20+ years of concurrent experience in Secondary/ Higher Education and as a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy I'm trained to get the job done.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A solo project - apart from help with editing and proofing - relies on my availability. That is in place and other than unavoidable, exceptional circumstances I'll be sticking to agreed targets.

This title combines short comments on events from Scotland's early history with matching images. The content identifies many key events from the earliest prehistory through to the Middle Ages. Taken together the images and comments deliver a colourful 'route map' connecting up major or dramatic events or incidents. (There's a lot of artwork, but Alba necessarily collects from across the titles).Primeval Scotland (36+ pages, 12+ illustrations)
Fuller commentary and images start to flesh out the story of early Scotland. Climate change, a huge meteor strike and any amount of volcanic activity feature large. While the inhabitants at various stages include sea scorpions, Skye's Jurassic dinosaurs and - those top-of-the line ambush predators - Sabretooth Tigers.


Ancient Scotland (36+ pages, 12+ illustrations)



Ancient Scotland continues from and follows the same approach as Primeval Scotland. As our distant ancestors arrive from Europe they begin by forming societies adapted to survive. However, as permanent hearths and homes appeared a sophisticated Neolithic civilisation developed - from roughly 6500 years ago. 
Much of what these early 'Scots' made and exported is quite familiar, at least in name, from sites such as Orkney's Ness of Brodgar and, later, Callanish.
The Road to Bannockburn (60+ pages, 10+ illustrations)


The first of two colour illustrated titles on the First Scottish War of Independence goes into greater detail than the shorter titles above. Sections of the text were tried-out online as a testing ground for accessible content, resulting in adding revised text, new text and original documents to offer a broad account of the conflict.
The rebellion of De Moray and Wallace is covered in the first title; along with the years between Wallace's capture and the defining battle at Bannockburn.
The Defence of the Realm (60+ pages, 10+ illustrations)

The years after Bannockburn brought further conflict and this title looks at how the conflict was contained and what was done to consolidate Scotland's position. As with the first of the pair, the e-book includes colour illustrations, links to Wikipedia to map key locations and suggestions for further reading.I'll add a slice of sample text from Defence of the Realm here:""Douglas was about to celebrate the completion of a new
hunting lodge at Lintalee in Jedburgh
forest.
Arundel thought it would be
a good idea to send a force of several thousand axe-wielding men-at-arms to
dismantle the new hunting lodge.
At the time James Douglas had barely fifty mounted men at his
disposal, along with several companies of archers drawn from the nearby Douglas
lands. An ambush was clearly in order and as Arundel's force
approached Douglas ordered his men to lash together the trees and thickets on
either side of a narrow point on the road.
The army of woodcutters advanced into the ambush, which
Douglas triggered by leading his knights on a charge at the English vanguard.
There may have been relatively few mounted Scottish knights, but funnelling
them into a road and charging at full speed resulted in a pile driving effect.


The English vanguard couldn’t back up or escape to either
side and the Scottish knights’ momentum placed a formidable bottleneck in the
only available road. As a result, Douglas' archers simply set about pouring
arrows into the largely immobilised English column.
Meanwhile, three hundred of the English troops had taken a different
route and stumbled upon Douglas' generously provisioned but unoccupied lodge.
Believing themselves safe in the knowledge that Douglas would either be defeated
or at the very least delayed at length, the English soldiers settled down to
enjoy a meal. 
It wasn't a meal they had time to savour, as Douglas had
identified Sir Thomas Richmond as the commander of the English forces on the
ground during the Scots’ initial charge.
As the two forces clashed, Douglas leapt straight from
his own horse on to Sir Thomas with a dagger at the ready.
Having stabbed the unfortunate Sir Thomas to death with the
dagger, Douglas then claimed the English knight's fur hat as a trophy - which
probably helped to further demoralise the already struggling English force.
Consequently, the battle was over almost as soon as it had
started and Douglas went straight back to his lodge. Few, if any, of the band
of feasting English soldiers survived his return.""
The feedback on the trial text was consistently good. which comes across as an encouragement to add key features and characters skipped at the first attempt. In particular, the one text revised to two texts uses more intense images, adds quotes from original documents, covers the early rebellion more fully and includes more personal stories. Sample feedback at the time.


Caledonia (60+ pages, 10+ illustrations)



While sticking to the illustrated, accessible approach the project's most discursive title ranges across a series of controversial or much debated topics. These date from early to relatively modern times and reconsider people and events such as the enigmatic Beaker People, the war against the Romans and much more recently the Massacre of Glencoe. You can quickly review the evidence and make up your own mind about which scenarios seem most credible.The Complete Caledonia (The Lot)
You're clearly a history enthusiast and you'd like all the content rolled into one epic e-title. That's a one of a kind copy with a cover chosen from the available artwork. Plus a title page showing your name and a Scottish symbol/ icon of choice from a set. Only you will receive the personal copy and hold access to your copy thereafter. I'll be making a handful of uniques for myself and immediate family, but will not be releasing your personal version.
  
Risks & Challenges What happens if the project doesn't meet its goal. On returning to 
Scottish history after a long break I was pleasantly surprised by how 
much more archeologists have uncovered and been made aware of how 
misinformation thrives on the Internet. The work needs done from my 
point of view and that's why I've selected the flexible funding option.
So,
 if resources are short I'll just have to dig a bit deeper and curb my 
habit of adding an extra this and that along the way. Basically, if you 
support the project I deliver the agreed content I'm committed to 
delivering to a high standard.
The work involved is all known territory. I've 20+ years of concurrent experience in Secondary/ Higher Education and as a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy I'm trained to get the job done.
A solo project - apart from help with editing and proofing - relies on my availability. That is in place and other than unavoidable, exceptional circumstances I'll be sticking to agreed targets. I'm building a fair amount of leeway into the delivery date to begin with, but I fully intend to be sending out the first titles very soon after the 60 days of this crowdfund.
  Other Ways You Can Help If you're unable to chip in on the cash front I'd appreciate a share or a mention to your mates. Nothing like a bit of passing round to generate a little extra interest.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story:</h3>
<p>I
began the first draft of my first novel, <i>Angels of War</i> (a New Adult
Techno-thriller centered on American college kids during societal collapse and
war), in the summer of 2009 during my junior year of college and completed it
before summer’s end. After it was over, I felt empty. I developed a constant
yearning to write more, to build on the world that I created. So the following
fall semester, I planned out the sequel. By Christmas I finished it. That
following spring, I wrote and completed the third book of the series. Back
then, it was just for fun. Sure, I edited it, and tweaked the story here
and there, but I never intended to publish. It wasn’t until I graduated
and started working a chemistry job I hated that I realized what I really
wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be an author.</p>
<p>After a year, I lost my job. Finally armed with free time,
I put the job hunt on pause and began taking the steps to get
published––converting my story to manuscript format, writing
query letters, etc. It took nearly a year of
living off my savings to complete two painstaking rewrites and several rounds
of editing to get <i>Angels of War</i> to its final draft. While I queried it, I combined my love of zombies, and my microbiology and neurobiology knowledge to start a completely new book series called <i>Undying </i>(a New Adult zombie novel).<br/></p>
<p>A few months ago, while querying both novels, I got in contact with a literary agent who represented one of my favorite zombie
series, <i>The Remaining</i>. He informed me that, due to oversaturation of the apocalyptic
genre (specifically the zombie genre), major publishing presses weren’t
picking up anything in that category unless it did well as a self-published
book on Amazon first (which is how the author of <i>The Remaining</i> landed his deal).
As someone adamant about controlling my own life, I am even more resolved
to keep creative control over my stories in my hands––something you lose with
traditional publishing. Also, the idea of higher royalties sounded enticing. Taking his advice, I began learning what it’d take to self-publish. So
here I am, crowdfunding the one thing in life that I am truly passionate about.</p>

<p>The Contest and Other Stories is a Young Adult / New Adult collection of nineteen spellbinding magical realism, paranormal, dark fantasy, slipstream, alternate history, and fabulist tales inspired by the works of international artists, and connected by a novella set in mid-twentieth-century New York City. Five stories are previously published in anthologies and journals. The lead story, “Night Café,” won the quarterly New Short Fiction Award at Jerry Jazz Musician (2012).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">THE STORY BEHIND THE STORIES</p>
<p>Written by authors Joe DiBuduo and Kate Robinson (and edited by Starstone Lit), this connected collection of Young Adult and New Adult speculative fiction inspired by artwork will be released in Summer 2017 by Tootie-Do Press. The publication requires extra funding due to  professional production costs for color inserts of well-known (and some not so well-known) paintings by international artists that inspired each story, and expenses related to the enhanced color ebook publication. The volume will be available in full-color hardcover, full-color softcover, BW interior softcover, and in color and BW e-book formats.</p>

<p>Separately, they've authored a variety of adult, young adult, middle-grade, and children’s fiction, nonfiction, and poetry in online and print journals and anthologies, including publications with Kearney Street Press, Southport Press, Rainstorm Press, Blood Bound Books, Elastic Press, Jerry Jazz Musician, Kaleidoscope, Literary Mama, Long Story Short, Raven Chronicles, The Whirlwind Review, June Cotner anthologies, Western Press Books, and others.</p>
<p>Joe DiBuduo is a retired housepainter with a wild bucket list. He also fills his front yard with giant sculptures, and earned a certificate in creative writing from Yavapai College in Prescott, Arizona (2009). Bookwise, he's the author of two mixed genre paranormal novels, The Mountain Will Cover You  &amp; Cryonic Man: A Paranormal Affair (JD Books, 2016 and Tootie-Do Press, 2015); a connected collection of short stories: Story Time @ The Chicagoua Cafe (JD Books 2016), a historically relevant memoir, Death by Electric Chair &amp; Other Boyhood Pursuits (Jaded Ibis Productions, 2015), a popular nonfiction narrative, A Penis Manologue: One Man's Response to The Vagina Monologues (JD Books, 2009, 2013), Out of This World Sci-fi Poetry (JD Books, 2010), two children's e-books, and miscellaneous collections of quirky flash fiction and “flash fiction poetry.”</p>
<p>Kate earned an MA in Creative Writing from Aberystwyth University, Wales (2010) and is the wordwhacking specialist at Starstone Lit Services and Tootie-Do Press near Los Angeles. Bookwise, she’s the author of a metaphysical sci-fi novel, Heart of Desire: 11.11.11 Redux (Tootie-Do Press, 2014), and two history books for middle-graders, The National Mall and Lewis and Clark: Exploring the American West (Enslow, Inc., 2005 and 2010). Loop, her MA program fantasy novella created from dreams shortlisted in the Texas Review Press Novella competition in 2010, and was recently revised and updated while she enjoyed the lake district at the Arteles Creative Center during the November 2016 Silence Awareness Existence residency in Finland. Her work in progress includes a memoir, a collection of nature essays, a poetry collection, retold folktales, and picture book fiction. She's also dreaming up quirky sequels to her metaphysical sci-fi novel and dream novella, which she would love to write in a galaxy far away, but will settle for the sweet redwood glade she recently moved to.</p>

The Contest and Other Stories is a Young Adult / New Adult collection of nineteen spellbinding magical realism, paranormal, dark fantasy, slipstream, alternate history, and fabulist tales inspired by the works of international artists, and connected by a novella set in mid-twentieth-century New York City. Five stories are previously published in anthologies and journals. The lead story, “Night Café,” won the quarterly New Short Fiction Award at Jerry Jazz Musician (2012).
THE STORY BEHIND THE STORIES
Written by authors Joe DiBuduo and Kate Robinson (and edited by Starstone Lit), this connected collection of Young Adult and New Adult speculative fiction inspired by artwork will be released in Summer 2017 by Tootie-Do Press. The publication requires extra funding due to  professional production costs for color inserts of well-known (and some not so well-known) paintings by international artists that inspired each story, and expenses related to the enhanced color ebook publication. The volume will be available in full-color hardcover, full-color softcover, BW interior softcover, and in color and BW e-book formats.
THE CONNECTING NOVELLA / BOOK PITCH
Peter John Rizzo,  a 1960 graduate of Yale University’s journalism program and an emerging creative writer, inherits Classic Art Exposé, an established but floundering art journal, from his uncle, John Rizzo.
Peter Rizzo, Pete’s father, is a banker who despises his late brother, scornful of his career in the Arts and Humanities, and jealous of his sibling’s influential relationship with his wife and son.
Jason, Uncle John’s devoted but unorthodox editorial assistant, and two local English student interns, sisters Shirley and Evie, help Pete start a monthly short story contest with artwork prompts, hoping to increase Classic Art Exposé’s readership and settle its debt.
As the four friends publish the winning short stories in the monthly journal over the following eighteen months, Pete must battle his father’s attempts to ruin his business and his reputation, and in the process, he discovers a sordid family secret.

REVIEWS
""'Yellow House' - featured in Say Goodnight to the Bad Guy [now titled 'A Twisted Garden' ] - by Joe DiBuduo and Kate Robinson - Historical horror with a new spin on a complex artist. I was intrigued the way the writers tied the painting to the story."" 
~ Chantal Boudreau, (Author, Nova Scotia), 2011
~*~
""I love the atmosphere and narration in the story Night Café... vivid and gripping... The frame narrative [The Contest] is a lot more compelling than I had initially expected. Not only does it have slight hints of beat literature to it (eg: reefer, sleeping in offices, etc.), but the story idea about an art magazine is a really interesting one too.""
~ UK millennial reader, 2017
AUTHOR BIOS
On a dull, cold day in February 2011,  authors Joe DiBuduo and Kate Robinson decided to have fun with some story collaborations. Joe sports the vivid imagination and Kate wields the detail toolbox and the word-whacking polish.
Separately, they've authored a variety of adult, young adult, middle-grade, and children’s fiction, nonfiction, and poetry in online and print journals and anthologies, including publications with Kearney Street Press, Southport Press, Rainstorm Press, Blood Bound Books, Elastic Press, Jerry Jazz Musician, Kaleidoscope, Literary Mama, Long Story Short, Raven Chronicles, The Whirlwind Review, June Cotner anthologies, Western Press Books, and others.
Joe DiBuduo is a retired housepainter with a wild bucket list. He also fills his front yard with giant sculptures, and earned a certificate in creative writing from Yavapai College in Prescott, Arizona (2009). Bookwise, he's the author of two mixed genre paranormal novels, The Mountain Will Cover You  & Cryonic Man: A Paranormal Affair (JD Books, 2016 and Tootie-Do Press, 2015); a connected collection of short stories: Story Time @ The Chicagoua Cafe (JD Books 2016), a historically relevant memoir, Death by Electric Chair & Other Boyhood Pursuits (Jaded Ibis Productions, 2015), a popular nonfiction narrative, A Penis Manologue: One Man's Response to The Vagina Monologues (JD Books, 2009, 2013), Out of This World Sci-fi Poetry (JD Books, 2010), two children's e-books, and miscellaneous collections of quirky flash fiction and “flash fiction poetry.”
Kate earned an MA in Creative Writing from Aberystwyth University, Wales (2010) and is the wordwhacking specialist at Starstone Lit Services and Tootie-Do Press near Los Angeles. Bookwise, she’s the author of a metaphysical sci-fi novel, Heart of Desire: 11.11.11 Redux (Tootie-Do Press, 2014), and two history books for middle-graders, The National Mall and Lewis and Clark: Exploring the American West (Enslow, Inc., 2005 and 2010). Loop, her MA program fantasy novella created from dreams shortlisted in the Texas Review Press Novella competition in 2010, and was recently revised and updated while she enjoyed the lake district at the Arteles Creative Center during the November 2016 Silence Awareness Existence residency in Finland. Her work in progress includes a memoir, a collection of nature essays, a poetry collection, retold folktales, and picture book fiction. She's also dreaming up quirky sequels to her metaphysical sci-fi novel and dream novella, which she would love to write in a galaxy far away, but will settle for the sweet redwood glade she recently moved to.
THE PRESS

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am a long-time Star Wars fan.  I saw the original in the theaters way back in 1977.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Disney purchased the property from George Lucas, I was skeptical.  But I saw the trailer for Episode VII and was cautiously optimistic.  I went to see The Force Awakens.  I walked in anticipating the next Star Wars film.  I walked out not caring if I ever saw another.  What’s interesting to me now, however, is not the franchise itself.   But rather, all of the drama that surrounds it instead.  It’s clear to thinking people that the Golden Goose that was the Star Wars franchise is now being cooked.  I find the story of how the Star Wars franchise is in the process of imploding to be absolutely fascinating.  I’ve attempted to express my opinions on blogs, discussion forums, and comments sections.  However, because those venues are more often controlled by progressives, opinions contrary to their own are expectedly deleted and/or marked for spam.  So I’ve opened a blog as a way to publish contrary and perhaps unpopular opinions that are not allowed to be expressed in various online safe spaces.  That blog will provide the foundational research for this book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to popular demand, I have opened a campaign to transform my blog into a book.  This campaign will fund the 6 to 9 months needed to collate and organize the pre-existing research as it exists on my blog, into a cohesive and coherent narrative.  Additional research and investigation will also take place during this time period.   Research to determine image usage and fair rights will also be ascertained.  During this time, my blog will also continue to chronicle events until The Rise of Skywalker leaves theaters.  The funds will also cover the IndieGoGo and Stripe percentages, cost of publication, shipping, packaging, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The narrative of the book will be organized according to The Phases of the Geeker gate, which is really the most important finding to come out of all of this.  It can then serve as a tool for others seeking to fight Geeker Gates in their own hobbies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, since Disney is notorious for their lawsuits, and Disney Star Wars is a knock-off version of genuine Star Wars anyway, I will be recreating certain images with photographs of knock-off Star Wars Action Figures, such as Ideal's STAR Team and others.</p>

<h4>Re-claiming Sexual Self Pleasure from the clutches of cultural shame (and late night television jokes) is an act of deep revolution. </h4>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> It is the doorway to deeper erotic connection with self and other.  How we “do ourselves” can show us so much about who we are sexually, where our joy lives, how to access it and how to become better and better lovers. Our culture consistently encourages us to be disconnected from our bodies; to either repress our sexuality or look to our partners to ""give"" us pleasure and our sense of sexual self-worth. Conscious Self-Pleasure is the first frontier for re-claiming the grand and unique imprint of ourselves as erotic beings.</span><br/>

</h3>

Self Pleasure: 


Sex Positive Term for a Wide Range of Sexual Self Loving and Erotically Empowered Acts.

The Self Pleasure Project: 

Getting Real about What is Perfectly Natural and Healthy. Real People, Real Stories. Real Pleasure.


      ""I am inviting people to share their stories and relationship (the good and the challenging) with this most fundamental of human activities. My hope in doing this is to normalize the normal, to inspire permission and self acceptance of pleasure for its own sake and to show the beauty of people taking pleasure into their own hands"" ~Victor Warring, SPP Creator


The end result will be a coffee table sized book filled with gorgeous images and authentic stories of Self Pleasure...        and a multi media presentation. 

The process of making this book involves people who are taking pleasure into their own hands---and sharing it with the Self Pleasure Project through in depth interviews and photo sessions. These Self Pleasure Activists are bravely owning their self pleasure and giving others permission to do the same.

Why Self Pleasure? Isn't that a private thing? Isn't that what you do when you can't get ""real sex""? Or something you give up once you get ""real sex""?


Because YOU are your primary sex partner. 

Your First Lover.

Re-claiming Sexual Self Pleasure from the clutches of cultural shame (and late night television jokes) is an act of deep revolution. 

 It is the doorway to deeper erotic connection with self and other.  How we “do ourselves” can show us so much about who we are sexually, where our joy lives, how to access it and how to become better and better lovers. Our culture consistently encourages us to be disconnected from our bodies; to either repress our sexuality or look to our partners to ""give"" us pleasure and our sense of sexual self-worth. Conscious Self-Pleasure is the first frontier for re-claiming the grand and unique imprint of ourselves as erotic beings.



Self Pleasure is you engaging with your most primary and life long sex partner...you! 



How to Join the 
Self Pleasure Revolution!!!

Risks & Challenges

 We would like to say with certainty that there are not any risks involved with this project, after all it's self pleasure.  Who could be hurt by a practice that encourages delight and joy in oneself?  One of our self pleasure loving friends said, ""it's really hard to be mean to myself or others when I am touching myself with love, affection, and joy."" The irony is that many would argue otherwise.  There is a whole plethora of dominant culture mythology about just how BAD self pleasure is.  
So, we cannot guarantee that your neighbor or another mother at your kid's school won't glare you down for supporting the open and healthy pursuit of pleasure for it's own sake.  We can say, that we think, despite cultural resistance, having more simple body based pleasure in our work and car filled lives CANNOT really be such a bad thing, despite what many of us were told.  
We encourage you to come out of the closet.  
And if you want to give anonymously and give us a whisper of support, we honor that too.

<h4><b><h4>A Truly Environmental Friendly Kids Field Guide<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> “Good for kids… Good for the environment!”</b>
</h4></b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Being an outdoor enthusiast and conservationist, when I decided to create the Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide, I not only wanted to get our children interested in discovering the outdoors, I also wanted to incorporate conservation into the book's development. While researching the differences between virgin paper vs. recycled paper, I came across stone paper. I was amazed at what I found, and that I hadn't heard of it before. Based on what I discovered, I made the decision to print t<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">he ""Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide"" entirely on stone paper. That’s right, it will be printed on paper made from stone, not trees! </span></p>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I selected stone
paper, which is basically made from pulverized cast-off marble or limestone because of how good it is for the environment. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Although it is
critically important to recycle all paper, stone paper requires less
energy to produce than virgin or recycled paper and there is NO water waste.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Not only is it ECCO </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">friendly,</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> stone paper is durable, waterproof, kid tough and 100% recyclable.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why The Campaign?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The
Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide is intended to bring the world of North American animals, birds, fish and waterfowl along with some of Africa's favorite animals to kid’s fingertips. But I can't do it without your help.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I need to raise $10,500 to cover the costs of the photography and illustrations being used to identify the animals in the field guide.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In order to go to press or print, I must </span>acquire<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> legal permission from all the photographers and illustrators to use </span>their copyrighted images and artwork. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Meaning, I must pay the photographers and illustrators for the rights to use their photos and illustrations in the Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide. </span><br/></p>
<p>Full-color photographs and illustrations are essential to correctly identify the variety of animals, birds, fish and waterfowl species. Basically, there is no Field Guide without the images, and I have over 200.</p>
<p>After contacting some of the photographers, I have found that the cost for 1 image can range from $20 to $250 depending on the photographer.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So, I am asking for your support and
in exchange I am offering a variety of perks. Everything from the Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide's revolutionary eBook, to hiking essentials.</p>
<p>Once I reach this goal, I can now go to press or should I say, have the hard bound book printed. So my stretch goal will be to raise the funds needed to print the hard bound book on the ECCO friendly stone paper. </p>
<p>If I meet my stretch goal, as a thank you for your support, every contributor to <b><i>this</i></b> campaign will also receive a hard copy of the Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide, no matter what your contribution amount.</p>

My name is Janet Mattingly and I LOVE the outdoors! By trade, I am a graphic designer, market researcher and award winning photographer, but when the economy crashed, many of my clients closed their doors for good. That put me in the position of needing to find a more steady form of income. I didn't want to just get a job, I wanted to do something that I enjoyed which lead me to getting a job at  a nation chain of outdoor sporting goods store.  


As the Promotions and Events"" coordinator, over the past five years I have worked with literally thousands of kids and adults, teaching them about the outdoors and exploring all it has to offer them through seminars, classes and workshops. In doing this, I am sad to say, that I have seen first hand how little our children today know about, or are connected to, the wonders and beauty of the world that surrounds them. 


I found every time I taught a class that had anything to do with animals, birds or even fishing classes, the kids eyes' would light up and the hands would go flying with questions, even the parents joined in, having questions of their own. It was wonderful to see everyone opening up and wanting to learn more than I had time to teach in my classes. 
With all the questions that were being asked, I went to the book section of our store to find a book that I could reference if I didn't know the answer to a question. What I found was, we didn't have a single animal identification book or field guide in our entire store. 
Even after searching online for a kids basic field guide that could be taken on a hike camping trip, park or even the zoo, I came away empty handed. I found everything but. There were books on insects, trees, plants and tons on birds. I couldn't find any that covered birds, animals and fish found across North America. That is why I created the""Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide"".


The Ultimate Kids Field Guide For Exploring The Great Outdoors


A Truly Environmental Friendly Kids Field Guide “Good for kids… Good for the environment!”


Being an outdoor enthusiast and conservationist, when I decided to create the Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide, I not only wanted to get our children interested in discovering the outdoors, I also wanted to incorporate conservation into the book's development. While researching the differences between virgin paper vs. recycled paper, I came across stone paper. I was amazed at what I found, and that I hadn't heard of it before. Based on what I discovered, I made the decision to print the ""Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide"" entirely on stone paper. That’s right, it will be printed on paper made from stone, not trees! 

I selected stone
paper, which is basically made from pulverized cast-off marble or limestone because of how good it is for the environment. 
Although it is
critically important to recycle all paper, stone paper requires less
energy to produce than virgin or recycled paper and there is NO water waste.
Not only is it ECCO friendly, stone paper is durable, waterproof, kid tough and 100% recyclable. To learn more, visit www.fieldguide4kids.com or click link at bottom of page.
 My Reasoning Is Simple. 




One Ton Of Virgin Paper:
On average, creates 16,000 gallons of contaminated waste water and uses approximately 11,134 kWh of energy to produce. This is equivalent to 10 months of energy used by an average household.  

One Ton Of Recycled Paper:

On average, creates 9,000 gallons of contaminated waste water and uses approximately 7,034 kWh of energy to produce. This is equivalent to 5 months of energy used by an average household.  


One Ton Of Stone Paper:

On average, creates 0 gallons of contaminated waste water and uses approximately 752 kWh of energy to produce. This is equivalent to less than 1 month of energy used by an average household and we are saving trees! 




Why The Campaign?
The
Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide is intended to bring the world of North American animals, birds, fish and waterfowl along with some of Africa's favorite animals to kid’s fingertips. But I can't do it without your help.
I need to raise $10,500 to cover the costs of the photography and illustrations being used to identify the animals in the field guide.
In order to go to press or print, I must acquire legal permission from all the photographers and illustrators to use their copyrighted images and artwork.  Meaning, I must pay the photographers and illustrators for the rights to use their photos and illustrations in the Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide. 
Full-color photographs and illustrations are essential to correctly identify the variety of animals, birds, fish and waterfowl species. Basically, there is no Field Guide without the images, and I have over 200.
After contacting some of the photographers, I have found that the cost for 1 image can range from $20 to $250 depending on the photographer.


So, I am asking for your support and
in exchange I am offering a variety of perks. Everything from the Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide's revolutionary eBook, to hiking essentials.
Once I reach this goal, I can now go to press or should I say, have the hard bound book printed. So my stretch goal will be to raise the funds needed to print the hard bound book on the ECCO friendly stone paper. 
If I meet my stretch goal, as a thank you for your support, every contributor to this campaign will also receive a hard copy of the Kid's Great Outdoors Field Guide, no matter what your contribution amount.

<h3>A Brief About Me</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Anshuman and I am a Technologist, a Leadership expert and a First-Time-Author.</p>
<p>With over 12.5 years of experience in this IT world, I have got the opportunity to work with a lot of great people, explore multiple technologies and wear multiple hats in my career.</p>
<p>Now I am focused in giving back to the society. I help organizations, technologists, managers and young entrepreneurs to achieve their goals, by unleashing their true potentials.</p>
<h3>A Brief About The Bad Manager</h3>
<p>“The Bad Manager” is the story of Aiden. A young man from Goa, who knew no failure. He was a star performer throughout his life. However, he fell prey to office politics and earned the title of “The Bad Manager”, when he was at the peak of his career. As the story unfolds, we will learn how he bounces back and set an example for others.</p>
<p>Apart from being a good-read, “The Bad Manager” also teaches a lot of life lessons, plenty of productivity hacks and exemplary leadership skills. The story also demonstrates a practical example of the RHHHK methodology, with the intention of helping organizations, technologists, managers and young entrepreneurs to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>It has taken me years to gain the confidence to write my first story and I hope to see it all the way through to publication. For reference, I’ve added the prologue of the book below so you may be able to judge the quality of the book. Please note that I’m still in the editing process so there may be spelling and grammatical errors.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>The money raised for this project will be utilized in the following manner:</p>

You try to explain to your boss about this situation, but she says it is your fault, as you were not paying attention to the requirements while the client was explaining. In such a scenario, what would you do? Would you like to just keep pushing yourself and try to meet the expectations of the client? Or would you like to resolve the conflicts, so that you can deliver a good product? I always opt for the latter.</p>

<h3>Alayna’s story</h3>
<p>Alayna is 15 years old and is a Special Needs child on the Autism Spectrum.  She is exceptionally talented, and she spends her free time reading, drawing cartoons, singing, and playing the violin.  She is always coming up with new characters and story lines for those personalities.  She never ceases to amaze me with the depth of her characters’ backstories.  Alayna loves music and her favorite violinist is Lyndsey Sterling.  In fact, when she’s not drawing or reading, she’s listening to Sterling and mimicking her style with her ‘air violin’.  She is currently in her third year of orchestra and hopes to be as good as her idol someday.  Alayna has a passion for helping children, especially those who might feel disconnected or stigmatized by their peers or by society.  Being a Special Needs child, she has a unique understanding of the children around her and she utilizes that understanding in developing her characters. </p>

<p>My name is Stephanie, and I am the mother of three amazing children.  And yes, I know every mother thinks their children are amazing, but mine really are. (OK, so I’m a little bias.)  I am a writer and public speaker, and while I can sketch a little here or there, the true artistic talent lies in my children.  As the mother of three children with three different personalities, it’s a juggle but one in which I take the most pride.  Each one has his/her own strengths and styles, and I truly love watching them grow and develop.  As the mother of a Special Needs child, I have learned so much. The most profound quote I’ve ever read on Autism was, “We’re not here to fit into your box.  We’re here to show you there is no box.” This book is the brainchild of Alayna and myself, and it was inspired by the children of cancer research.  I have the pleasure of personally knowing some rather remarkable superheroes, and it’s they who inspired me to write and Alayna to draw.</p>
<h2>About the Book</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511916692/aafo1jl0orusm9wlwpmn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Vikki Victorious is the first of its kind.  Vikki is a superhero, who just happens to be a cancer survivor.  It is her ultimate battle with cancer that provides her mission to help other children who are fighting their very own, very real battle.  It is for this reason that 5 percent of all profits made from the sale of this book will benefit children of cancer research and their families.  </p>
<p>This book is the first of a series. This book, and the others that will follow, will not only provide hope and inspiration to a specific audience that is often overlooked, but it will also allow Alayna the opportunity to reach out to other children, like herself, and make a positive impact in their lives. </p>

The most profound quote I’ve ever read on Autism was, “We’re not here to fit into your box.  We’re here to show you there is no box.” This book is the brainchild of Alayna and myself, and it was inspired by the children of cancer research.  I have the pleasure of personally knowing some rather remarkable superheroes, and it’s they who inspired me to write and Alayna to draw.
About the Book

Vikki Victorious is the first of its kind.  Vikki is a superhero, who just happens to be a cancer survivor.  It is her ultimate battle with cancer that provides her mission to help other children who are fighting their very own, very real battle.  It is for this reason that 5 percent of all profits made from the sale of this book will benefit children of cancer research and their families.  
This book is the first of a series. This book, and the others that will follow, will not only provide hope and inspiration to a specific audience that is often overlooked, but it will also allow Alayna the opportunity to reach out to other children, like herself, and make a positive impact in their lives. 

Your support in this project makes all this possible, and that is why we need you.
What We Need 
Your support is needed for publication costs (printing, licensing and associated legal fees), and it is estimated to be about $8,000.

On a Personal Note
I really want to thank you for expressing an interest in this project.  It has been such an amazing journey watching my daughter blossom into the talent that she has become.  Seeing her make a difference in the lives of other children who have had obstacles thrust before them at such a tender age is truly remarkable and quite honestly, inspiring.  Like other children with Autism, she faces many challenges, but she does with a sweet smile and a loving heart.  I truly appreciate your support in this endeavor.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>For the first-timer and/or inexperienced author, the self-publishing route can often turn into a time-consuming and very expensive maze - resulting in more failures than successes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Three-Legged Elephant Publishing's</strong> goal is to be the bridge between that first-time writer with a raw manuscript in hand - and an author with a professionally-polished book for sale.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Malcolm Boyd.  I am the published author of the Mann Walker crime fiction trilogy, and the children’s book ‘My First Train.’  My own first attempt at being published quickly turned into a nightmare:</p>
<p>·       My book is selling, but where was the money?</p>
<p>·       My publisher is saying THIS, but doing THAT </p>
<p>·       The constant infighting with my Editor, who was changing <strong>my </strong>manuscript into <strong>their</strong> personal vision of my story. </p>
<p>·       Why isn’t my book in bookstores?</p>
<p>The number of self-published authors is rising rapidly, and I personally have mentored numerous first-time authors who otherwise would have ended up like me: broken down on the side of Publishing Road.</p>
<p>According to trade magazine, Publishers Weekly, “Self-publishing continues to expand, with ISBN registrations jumping 21% from 2014 to 2015 (the most recent data available), according to the bibliographic solutions company Bowker.”</p>
<p>But even for self-published authors who choose to put their collective noses to the grindstone, too many are left to second-guessing and wishing they had ‘fixed this’ or ‘changed that’ - after the fact.  Signing a ‘one size fits all’ contract is how most first-time authors’ budgets are exhausted. </p>
<p>However, every author has different needs.   </p>
<p><strong>Three-Legged Elephant Publishing (TLEP)</strong> knows this, and we have tailored an author’s contract to those individual areas of concentration.  We work WITH the first-time author to make sure we stay on point. </p>
<p>TLEP is not only a good idea: it’s NEEDED.</p>
<p>Robin Cutler, director of the self-publishing arm of Ingram Book Company, the world’s largest distributor, stated: “…indie authors who had previously focused on digital are looking to publish in print and other formats. “Getting their titles into brick-and-mortar bookstores as well as into libraries continues as a goal for many indie authors this year and into next year.”</p>
<p>Successful indie authors see themselves as entrepreneurs who are running a business.   Successful authors have to focus on their business – their books - and manage the ups and downs.  And that is the truth!</p>
<p>I had to become an entrepreneur, not only to get my own books published - printed and sold - it also became my personal goal to share my knowledge with other newbie authors!</p>
<p>Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can be a printed author in a matter of days, and an eBook author in a matter of minutes. BUT - without a concerted marketing strategy, which most self-published authors have neither the expertise nor the resources to generate, these books are more than likely to be lost in the crowd, and a financial loss for the author.</p>
<p>THREE-LEGGED ELEPHANT PUBLISHING has chosen a system to give every writer the chance to have their work evaluated. This puts the emphasis back on talent, and allows writers the opportunity to have their books edited and designed at the highest level. Our marketing department will then deliver a fully-integrated campaign tailored to each book.</p>
<p>If you support this campaign I can (ALMOST) GUARANTEE YOU FOUR THINGS:</p>
<p>1.     You will sleep better at night.</p>
<p>2.     You will live longer.</p>
<p>3.     Your blessings will be returned.</p>

<h3>A New Book from the Guy Who Knows A Guy</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Whitehouse, and I am known by many in Southeast Connecticut as <a href=""http://www.theguywhoknowsaguy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Guy Who Knows A Guy</a>. The moniker comes from the name of my first book, detailing the skills and strategies I employed in going from a newbie knowing no one in 2014 to a well connected guy in 2017.</p>
<p>Aiming for release in March 2020, I am now writing <u>The Four Foundations of Building Business</u>, a one stop, easy to read resource for people in business to learn the key skills they need to succeed.</p>
<p>After writing my first book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0728NWLBV/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1496279452&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+guy+who+knows+a+guy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Guy Who Knows A Guy</a>, I spoke to many business owners and discovered that there is a core set of soft skills that every person in business needs, and I could not find a simple, approachable go to guide to get the basics of those four areas.</p>
<h3>The Four Foundations</h3>
<p>Marketing, Sales, Networking, and Problem Solving are four foundations upon which the success of any organization is built. Many resources focus on technical issues like accounting and budgeting and logistics, but any technical issue can be effectively outsourced. While consultants and teams can assist in the execution of these four foundations, leaders must be proficient in all four areas to have success.</p>
<p>Over the last twenty years, I have worked with numerous for-profit and non-profit organizations in a variety of leadership roles. Some of these organizations benefited from leadership who were proficient in all four foundations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many leaders have gaps in one or more foundations. They are hard working and highly competent people, but they have simply not had an easily accessible way to fillthose skill gaps. This book will be an easily approachable, easy to read resource for people in all levels of business to achieve awareness and basic proficiency in these four key foundations.</p>
<p>Many businesses fail because the owners and key people lack proficiency in one or more of these key areas. This is a tragedy because so many of these owners are excellent in their chosen field, but they simply lack education. My goal is to create a simple, go to resource that the overwhelmed person in business can read and put right to work, giving them vital information and possibly saving their business.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Be A Part Of My New Book</h3>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to give you the chance to be involved in the process of this book.

<h3>The Impact</h3>

In the last 10 years I have helped many people develop their own nutrition plan to get healthier according to their individual dietary and health needs. With most clients I work very closely with their primary care doctor to make sure I am giving them the proper recommendations.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is your family's story?</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">(And who will remember it in fifty years?)</h3>
<p>     This fundraiser is for ""Hidden Appalachia: Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 3"", the final volume of a three-book series that we created to preserve the hidden history of Coeburn, Virginia. Volume 1 was published and delivered earlier this year, while Volume 2 is in the works with a scheduled November delivery. The content of the first two books came largely from public materials, but this one will be different. Volume 3 is to be a collection of family stories and photos which will be shared with us by the members of Coeburn families themselves. So, much of the material in this book will never have been seen by the public before.</p>
<p>     This is your chance to write down your own family's story and see it published for posterity! Your kids, grandkids, and even your great-grandkids will all be able to read about your family in the book.</p>
<p>     But what if you're not a writer? Well, don't let that scare you, because we are here to help. We will provide guidelines, templates, and advice for your stories, editing to correct any problems with the text, and even photo retouching to make those less-than-perfect family images look great in print. But if you feel that you absolutely cannot write, then I bet you still have a relative or friend who can. So make that phone call to Aunt Mary who does family genealogy, or Cousin Jim who plans all the reunions, or maybe even that talented grand-child who really has a knack for words, and words, and words...<br/><br/>     It really doesn't matter who writes it down, so long as it gets written.</p>
<p>     Once this project is completed, each contributor will receive their own copy of the book as a perk. And to make sure the book will be available for future generations, several copies of ""Hidden Appalachia: Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 3"" will be donated to local and university libraries. Plus, it will be made available through print-on-demand (i.e. each book is printed as you order it) starting in 2023.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>Book Design</h3>
<p>     ""Hidden Appalachia: Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 3"" will be a soft-cover 6"" x 9"" book, similar to the first two volumes in the series. However, we expect this book will be much longer, maybe 200-500 pages, depending on how many families participate.</p>
<p>     For each contributor a minimum of one page will be set aside for their family story. This is enough space to print approximately 400 words of text, or 300 words plus a quarter-page photo, or 200 words with a half-page photo. And if one page is not big enough to tell all of your family story, then you can easily sign up for additional pages, either now or later.</p>
<p>     Your family story can be about almost anything you want. It can be a genealogy / family tree, a narrative of your family's overall Coeburn experience, an original story or poem from your family, or even a tribute to that special grand-parent or grand-child.</p>
<p>     So what do YOU want people to remember about your family?</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>Hasn't This Been Done Before?</h3>
<p>     Yes, sort of. In 1994 the Coeburn Kiwanis Club published a marvelous book called, ""Coeburn, Virginia Area History - Celebrating the Centennial of the Town of Coeburn."" This was an 850 page hardcover book with scads of Coeburn history, including the biographical sketches and photos of 216 Coeburn families. Unfortunately, this book is now out of print, and it is difficult to even find a used copy without spending $400 on eBay.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>So How Will This Work?</h3>
<p>     (1) At the end of the fundraiser each contributor will receive an information packet by email which will include submission guidelines, writing samples and templates, release forms, and other useful and necessary stuff.</p>
<p>     (2) You (or another family writer) will then write your story, choose and scan your photos, and forward everything to us with completed releases by email and/or postal mail. The deadline for your submissions will be 31 January 2022. This may seem like a long way off, but it's really not. And if you want to send your submissions in early then that will be great too. However, this schedule is intended to afford you some time to confer with distant family members during any upcoming reunions or holiday gatherings, and maybe learn more about your family's story.</p>
<p>     (3) Once we receive your submissions we will polish up the text and photos as necessary, format it for printing, and then send you a page proof for approval. If you like it, then great. But if anything needs to be changed before it's published, then all you have to do is ask. We will make the necessary corrections and then send you another page proof for approval.</p>
<p>     (4) Starting in February 2022 we will compile all the submissions into book format. This should be finished by the end of April 2022, then we will send the book to the printer to await a proof copy. If the proof copy looks perfect then we can promptly order up a big batch of books.</p>
<p>     (5) After we receive the printed books they will be mailed out to each contributor, as a perk, in July 2022.</p>
<p>     (6) Once you receive your own book, the one you helped create, you can sit back and be happy to know that you helped save the hidden history of Coeburn, Virginia, our fascinating Appalachian hometown!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>What We Need From You</h3>
<p>     To make this project work, we will need the support of many people who, like us, feel a special connection to Coeburn, Virginia. We not only need your financial support, but also your participation and encouragement with this project. We absolutely cannot make this book without you!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>     People who cannot contribute to the fundraiser can still help out by sharing the campaign on Facebook with their family members, friends, co-workers, and anyone else who might be interested in Coeburn history. You can do this by simply clicking on the Facebook icon at the top of the page.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>About The Authors</h3>
<p>     Dee Ratliff Kenady grew up in the forests of the Cumberland Plateau, living the rare life of a free mountain child. As an adult she has worked hard to share her journey in print, publishing many poems, stories, and books that are well-rooted in her Appalachian life experience. Dee's knowledge and insight about the ""old ways"" has been invaluable in framing this project in a meaningful context.</p>
<p>     Wade Kenady is originally from Caney Ridge, just inside Dickenson County. He began his education in the two-room Rugby School and later attended schools at Clintwood and Coeburn. As an amateur historian he has studied local stories and Appalachian culture for over a decade. Wade still has kinfolk living in the Coeburn area, and consider it to be his memorable hometown.</p>

     (3) Once we receive your submissions we will polish up the text and photos as necessary, format it for printing, and then send you a page proof for approval. If you like it, then great. But if anything needs to be changed before it's published, then all you have to do is ask. We will make the necessary corrections and then send you another page proof for approval.
     (4) Starting in February 2022 we will compile all the submissions into book format. This should be finished by the end of April 2022, then we will send the book to the printer to await a proof copy. If the proof copy looks perfect then we can promptly order up a big batch of books.
     (5) After we receive the printed books they will be mailed out to each contributor, as a perk, in July 2022.
     (6) Once you receive your own book, the one you helped create, you can sit back and be happy to know that you helped save the hidden history of Coeburn, Virginia, our fascinating Appalachian hometown!

What We Need From You
     To make this project work, we will need the support of many people who, like us, feel a special connection to Coeburn, Virginia. We not only need your financial support, but also your participation and encouragement with this project. We absolutely cannot make this book without you!

Other Ways You Can Help
     People who cannot contribute to the fundraiser can still help out by sharing the campaign on Facebook with their family members, friends, co-workers, and anyone else who might be interested in Coeburn history. You can do this by simply clicking on the Facebook icon at the top of the page.

learn to read and write and speak foreign languages, to aid in the advancement
of themselves.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434295215/c2ix9wxsgohnlpsl6ktm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>               <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">This is a monastic school where

education and with a lack of human rights. He understood the importance of
education and began his studies at a gratis school. He then became an essential
guide for the young people. He has always wanted to help Burmese children with
good education, and for them to understand human rights and democracy in Burma.
This is why he continues to supports this monastery from the western world, where human rights and freedom from fear aid him in his quest. T<span>his school will continue to benefit from the proceeds of

For example, the Buddhist monks and the Burmese government will feel angry with what I wrote in this book? Even though I had been living in a monastery since I was 3 years old. Also, I have the proof for that?</p><p></p><p>Answer (Steve): Well I can’t speak for their side. In the west, we will see you more as a person, a human being.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Question (Steve): In your book, I found you were quite hard, and possibly   aggressive towards the police and military services. In the west we look on these services for protection, but in Burma your accounts are not so?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Answer (Ashin):      I don’t think the aggressive words used in this book against the military and police are offensive to them. Now, I will explain to you who the military and police are in Burma. They have had poor education at that time in Burma. Now, I do not know exactly. but there are not a lot of changes. I have been in France for 6 years. Since I was 3 years old, my parents left me in a monastery. Time to time I visited to the village of my parents. Around the village there were soldiers and police. Sometimes I had the conversations with them. Through talking with them I found out they had not had a good education. In Burma there are two ways you can become a soldier, the first way is, when you finish your high school level, you will receive the papers and can enroll in the DSA Defense Services Academy School and become an officer. Normally if you finish your examination like the BAC in France, the students have learned about the human rights and team work and to think about what their rights are and what is their responsibility. But, the education system in Burma is not like in Europe, many children, students, are not honest with their exams and because of good contacts, they can enter into DSA Defense Services Academy School with a low education. Because of this they are not able to decide what is right or what is wrong, or what is good or what is bad. But being an officer means having power, can be someone important, be the president in Burma. Even my master, he wanted me to be an officer in the military, to become president or someone important in Burma, that’s why many people would like to attend the military university to become an officer. They don’t really know what their responsibility is. They want to be an officer in military just for the power, the second type is that they join the military at very young ages, 13, 14, 15 years old. Most soldiers are around 20/25 years old. So many soldiers are uneducated kids, there are recruiters who try to get kids to join the army. These children are from poor uneducated families and hang out on the streets. Because of this I think they will not take offence of my words in this book, also they know this is true and a reality of their life and also they do not like their lives in military. I have to describe them like this because this is the way it is in Burma. When I describe them like this, for western people it comes across as harsh because here in Europe there are military and police to protect you. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Question (Steve): Why did you entitle your book “Revolution of the Monks?” </p><p></p><p> Answer (Ashin).  Firstly, I chose the title ‘Revolution of the Monks’ because this protest gave me an idea to write this book, secondly, it implies about change, personal and psychological change within a monk, it is about how I changed my way of thinking, traditions and my monk lifestyle. So it is because of these two reasons that I titled this novel. This is not a biography as it only relates to the time of the protests in Burma. After reading this book you now have an understanding of the personal revolution of monks, many that had left Burma, like me, to lead normal lives in other countries. For example, I am not a monk anymore. Many monks in Burma do not want to be monks anymore but they are afraid to be poor in civil lives. So they are still monks. Me, I have made a change or you could say a revolution of my monk life. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Question (Steve): My last question is, why did you decide to write this book, what was your goal, or incentive?</p><p> </p><p>Answer (Ashin):  Well, after the revolution of the monks I moved to the frontier. I had many struggles and rested in a town at the Thai/Burma border called Maesot. There I met some monks, who were also in the revolution. They were not writers or artists. They live a normal monks life.  me, I am a writer, even though I did not publish anything in Burma, I loved to write poetry, novels and articles, Like my books ‘The Eight Path Ways for Life’ it is a philosophy book in English and ‘A Visit to a Meditation Centre with a Spanish woman’ this is also long novel which I had written in Burma before the revolution.  I had 2 reasons to write this book. Firstly as I am a writer, I cannot live without writing during 9, 10 months at the border.  Secondly, when we arrived at the border, many journalists came and ask a lot of questions to the monks and people. I heard some monks talk about their personal emotions regarding this revolution. But, they did not remember any more about the revolution in detail. Me, I have noted the dates and the situation about our revolution as soon as I arrived at the border. I knew exactly how the revolution was started, why? Because there were small community among me and my colleague monks and Moe Nyein , this is not his real name, he was a young boy. We did not see each other all the time but we knew what each other were doing. That’s why finally I found out who U Gambira is, he became famous, very famous after the revolution of the monks. What I want to say is that many monks gave interviews but they could not give the background behind the revolution, or many details. Me, I was not very famous, but it was me which was working at the back. But I hid from the media, I did not want to be famous and also I did not want to be in the media, because I lived close to Shwedagone Pagoda. In this area, all the police and people knew me before starting the revolution because I was with the tourists many times on the street. And also I did not think that one day I could be at the border. I wanted to have a good life in Burma but our country was very poor because of the military government. That’s why me and other my colleague monks exploded our emotions at that time. I was an organizer from behind the revolution. I gave many suggestions to the other monk leaders, so it’s only me who knows all the details regarding the revolution. The people who were involved did not know all the details on how the revolution started.  But they made many interviews afterwards because they were famous, they are close to the media, they are politicians. So I decided to write about this revolution or everybody will forget our revolution and get wrong information. Even Wikipedia, they could only write down the limited information which they had from the people, who were in the revolution, but nobody knows the details.  In the book I mix my personal life and the revolution. I am sure that all western people like Buddhist philosophy, Even if they don’t know the living style of monks in Burma. I don’t think they will look down on Buddhism and on other monks because of this book. But some of them will look down on me a little for sure. But, I don’t care for this because I am not a monk anymore in Europe. I liked my life in the monastery because I lived in a monastery for 22 years and the monastery has stayed in my heart, and also I have many gratitude to the monastery. I just want to tell the reality in this book. So I would like to say that I write this book, not to attack, I was a freeman when I wrote it, and I’m not standing at the side of politicians who are against the military government or at the side of the monks either.  I don’t want to tell lies about the revolution.</p><p>My incentive of this book is, after reading this book, everybody will keep it in their library and this book is very very very useful for everybody.  This book, for example is for the philosophers and sociology students, politicians and diplomat and all people who are interested in Burmese culture and Buddhism. I think everybody will get something from this book and also they will have a better understanding of Burma and Buddhism, that’s what I want to give to the people with this book. </p><p></p><p> Thank you to all involved in the project of revolution of the monks (Ashin)</p></div>","Revolution of the Monks

based on the Saffron Revolution of the Burmese Monks which took place in Burma
(Myanmar), September 2007. Ashin Yevata was one of the monk leaders in the
protest just before the Tibetan unrest in 2008. Burma
had been under military dictatorship for 60 years. These are his accounts
during the Saffron revolution for the liberty of the Burmese people, and also
his personal revolution. 
The Story

            REVOLUTION OF THE MONKS is a personal journey of a Buddhist Monk through the protests in Myanmar (Burma) 2007. The book describes events of the protests against dictatorship, personal relationships and thoughts and feelings of a practicing monk.As a Former Burmese Buddhist Monk, he decided to write about his role in the Revolution of the Monks and share an insight into his personal life during the Revolution of 2007, Political and Military participation in the protests, and their personal and cultural differences.   This book was written in Thailand 2008 while waiting to enter Europe, his goal was to record information on the Revolution so this piece of history was not lost.It has been six years in the making with translations from Burmese to English, French, Spanish and German.Why We Need Your Help            The purpose of this book is to raise donations to realize his dream of
running a free, gratis, Wellbeing Center. The doors will be open to all. Why do
this? Ashin would like to make exchanges with students, free from constraints
of money, this provides good morality and honest participations, this also
ensures the less fortunate among us have the opportunity to attend the center. Another benefit will be a
school already opened by Ashin in Burma, where young monks and local children
learn to read and write and speak foreign languages, to aid in the advancement
of themselves.               This is a monastic school where
Ashin taught English language to the candidates, monks and novices who don’t
have parent at gratis monastic school.
 If you would like to meet the
students in Yangon, you can join us on our visit or go to directly yourself to
(Kaytumadi monastery, Mayangone Township Yangon, Myanmar)Our slogan is “help others by
helping ourselves”.
            Ashin was a poor monastic boy.
This is where he met many young monks and novices growing up without good
education and with a lack of human rights. He understood the importance of
education and began his studies at a gratis school. He then became an essential
guide for the young people. He has always wanted to help Burmese children with
good education, and for them to understand human rights and democracy in Burma.
This is why he continues to supports this monastery from the western world, where human rights and freedom from fear aid him in his quest. This school will continue to benefit from the proceeds of
this book.           There is a detailed description on Center LASANDAR which explains in full the concept of the center. Please free to visit the website for further information. For the moment, Lasandar remains open through subscriptions. This keeps the center running until donations through the book are received. All students of Lasandar will be able to donate with exchanges to continually improve its services and upkeep. In the future we hope to open a further free relaxation center in Burma or Asia for internships or training and retirement, and well-being in exotic countries, to make partnerships with monks, and also with Asian and European instructors.             This Novel will be dispatched to you in e-book format for a donation of 10 dollars when it has reached its target of 8500 contributions.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Mark and I'm a young boy from Europe, Czech republic. Maybe my age is low, but my ambitions and visions are pointing to the stars. I didn't have an easy life, my childhood was full of fear and watching my parents as the worst examples in how to live right. They never believed in my big dreams and ambitions, it was always too unreal to imagine for them, that something like this could be possible. Last year they divorced and I started with investing to myself - I have read many of books about personal growth, I visited lot of seminars and I started to meet people with the same meaning like me. Now I've got  very special and unique know-how and I really want to share it with the others.</p>
<h3>My campaign?<br/> </h3>
<p>This campaign is very important for me. I feel it like an obligation - to share my knowledge about personal growing with whole world, because people are blind, people don't see these opportunities around them and maybe they even don't want to see it. That's the reason why they will never chase their dreams and goals and why they will be sad and unsatisfied forever. I want to change it and help them with building completely different mindset - different style of thinking. I want them to think big, to dream big. Because with this mindset is everything possible.</p>
<p>My book should be about - you can achieve anything you set your mind to - in any age, in any place, whoever you are, however hard times did you have. You can do it. Do you have any dreams? So follow them and chase them. No matter if you're 16 years old or 100.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I chose the flexible funding, because there is no special amount that I dramatically need for chase my dream. Any amount of money, any help of you will help me and the whole world and I appreciate every dollar from you.<br/>Money from this fund will be used for publishing, translating to other languages, printingthe book and so on, but also money which will left (if this crowdfunding is going to be successful), I'm going to invest them. Each dollar will be invested the best way - to my own business and to stocks. It may sounds crazy, but to be honest - I want to be absolutely opened to you - My project is on the beggining and I need money for things like publishing and giving to my book the physical form, but also I need money to ""buy some time"" to be absolutely focused only to my project. Money that will left I'm going to invest them, because it will help me to become a real millionaire from a student.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution can help me but even the whole world. I'm persuaded  that my book can leave here very big legacy. My book is going to be valuable for you and the rest of the world from one special reason - My know-how is a big combination from the most famous people from the wordl like Thomas Edison, Napoleon Hill, Jack Canfield, Brian Tracy, Robin Sharma, Grant Cardone and people that their books and their knowledge changed the world. I'm not going to copy them, I'm going to write about my personal and very successful experience with knowledge from these people - and I want o show the world that anyone can do it, anyone can achieve it - in any age,.... I see my big value in my low age, because when people will see a young man writing about his personal results with this mindset, I hope that they will think about changing their mindsets too. If a 20 years old boy did it, whoever can do it.<br/><br/>If you help me, you can help the world by touching millions of lives and also I'm sure that if you buy my book one day, you will be satisfied and blessed, that you helped me with this fung a long time ago.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course that it's a big challenge for a young boy. To be honest, for me it's a biggest challenge in my life. But that's the reason why I'm doing it.  I love beating challenges, it's my passion. There may be lot of haters who won't trust me, but I'm not a person who cares about haters, I care about people who want to teach something more or who want to help, I care about people who are opened to my know-how. Any challenge is too big for me. Finishing this project is my deal and I'm going to finish it at any cost.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help Me</h3>
<p>Dear people, if my campaign wasn't enough attractive for you and you don't want to help me or you're not able to help me, you can help me just for example with saying to your friends or anyone else about this project. Let they know about me and maybe they wilb be exited to help me!<br/><br/>Thank you so much!</p>
</div></div>","Who am I?
My name is Mark and I'm a young boy from Europe, Czech republic. Maybe my age is low, but my ambitions and visions are pointing to the stars. I didn't have an easy life, my childhood was full of fear and watching my parents as the worst examples in how to live right. They never believed in my big dreams and ambitions, it was always too unreal to imagine for them, that something like this could be possible. Last year they divorced and I started with investing to myself - I have read many of books about personal growth, I visited lot of seminars and I started to meet people with the same meaning like me. Now I've got  very special and unique know-how and I really want to share it with the others.
My campaign? 
This campaign is very important for me. I feel it like an obligation - to share my knowledge about personal growing with whole world, because people are blind, people don't see these opportunities around them and maybe they even don't want to see it. That's the reason why they will never chase their dreams and goals and why they will be sad and unsatisfied forever. I want to change it and help them with building completely different mindset - different style of thinking. I want them to think big, to dream big. Because with this mindset is everything possible.
My book should be about - you can achieve anything you set your mind to - in any age, in any place, whoever you are, however hard times did you have. You can do it. Do you have any dreams? So follow them and chase them. No matter if you're 16 years old or 100.

What I Need & What You Get
I chose the flexible funding, because there is no special amount that I dramatically need for chase my dream. Any amount of money, any help of you will help me and the whole world and I appreciate every dollar from you.Money from this fund will be used for publishing, translating to other languages, printingthe book and so on, but also money which will left (if this crowdfunding is going to be successful), I'm going to invest them. Each dollar will be invested the best way - to my own business and to stocks. It may sounds crazy, but to be honest - I want to be absolutely opened to you - My project is on the beggining and I need money for things like publishing and giving to my book the physical form, but also I need money to ""buy some time"" to be absolutely focused only to my project. Money that will left I'm going to invest them, because it will help me to become a real millionaire from a student.

The Impact
Your contribution can help me but even the whole world. I'm persuaded  that my book can leave here very big legacy. My book is going to be valuable for you and the rest of the world from one special reason - My know-how is a big combination from the most famous people from the wordl like Thomas Edison, Napoleon Hill, Jack Canfield, Brian Tracy, Robin Sharma, Grant Cardone and people that their books and their knowledge changed the world. I'm not going to copy them, I'm going to write about my personal and very successful experience with knowledge from these people - and I want o show the world that anyone can do it, anyone can achieve it - in any age,.... I see my big value in my low age, because when people will see a young man writing about his personal results with this mindset, I hope that they will think about changing their mindsets too. If a 20 years old boy did it, whoever can do it.If you help me, you can help the world by touching millions of lives and also I'm sure that if you buy my book one day, you will be satisfied and blessed, that you helped me with this fung a long time ago.

Risks & Challenges
Of course that it's a big challenge for a young boy. To be honest, for me it's a biggest challenge in my life. But that's the reason why I'm doing it.  I love beating challenges, it's my passion. There may be lot of haters who won't trust me, but I'm not a person who cares about haters, I care about people who want to teach something more or who want to help, I care about people who are opened to my know-how. Any challenge is too big for me. Finishing this project is my deal and I'm going to finish it at any cost.

</p><p>My name is John Bunce, and I am a doctoral candidate in psychology
at the University of California, Merced. In the wake of the recent tragedy at
Umpqua Community College in Oregon, I was watching a segment by the Late
Show with Stephen Colbert that discussed the roles of Honesty and Pretending in
the modern political discourse. Particularly moving were Mr. Colbert’s thoughts
concerning the national reaction to these horrific events; he accurately called
attention to how we consistently respond to mass shootings by expressing shock
and sadness, then we do nothing and act surprised when it happens again. </p>
<p>The time has come to change our collective response by taking
decisive steps to pass responsible and enforceable firearm regulations.  This is why, with the support of a diverse
collection of like-minded colleagues, I am seeking your support to establish
the Firearms Undoubtedly Need Regulation Association (FUNRA), a political
action committee for taking a direct stand against the powerful gun-rights
lobby and advocating for sensible firearm regulation policy.  While this task may seem insurmountable,
pretending that another mass shooting won’t happen is just plain insane. I can
no longer reconcile my inaction with my conscience. Something must be done. Please
help us take a stand to make this country safer for our children and all
Americans.</p>
<p><b>What We Need
&amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We are seeking funding in the amount of $15,000. This money
would be used to create essential organizational infrastructure (e.g., to register
with the appropriate government agencies, to build a website), to directly
support pro-reform candidates in competitive races at the national and state
level, and to develop a direct counter campaign that challenges the many groups obstructing
the implementation of sensible reform, such as universal background checks. To spread
FUNRA’s message, we will utilize multiple modes of advertising, including:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Video </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Direct mail </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Social media</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Email</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Media engagement</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Event coordination </p>
<p>Several perks are planned to reward early FUNRA supporters. A
contribution of $25.00 achieves Silver Status and FUNRA’s first bumper sticker.
Donations of $100 are classified as Gold Status, and the contributor receives a
FUNRA t-shirt and bumper sticker.</p>
<p>This is an all-or-nothing campaign, so if we fail to reach our
goal, supporters will get their contributions back. We believe this funding
represents the crucial amount necessary to ensure our ability to make a
meaningful impact. We are committed to using at least 70% of all contributions
to directly engage in campaigning for the gun regulation during the 2016
election cycle.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Stop being a pretender, and help us establish the Firearms
Undoubtedly Need Regulation Association to take a stand against needless gun
violence. As a first step, FUNRA will work to pass legislation implementing
universal background checks on the purchase of firearms nationwide. We believe
closing the gun show and private sale loopholes will keep firearms out of the
hands of those that might use them to harm others. After establishing the
essential organizational infrastructure, FUNRA will begin a targeted digital
media campaign in support of candidates who have committed to firearm law
reform. After completing this stated goal, FUNRA will continue its mission to
support the passage of sensible gun regulation by supporting tested measures
that reduce violence, address mental health concerns, and ensure the safety of
all citizens.  The founding members of
FUNRA have backgrounds in psychology, social services, community activism, public
health, statistics, and video production, providing the organization with a
diverse toolkit to face the challenges posed by gun violence in our society. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p>The real risk lies in doing nothing, and the challenges those in
support of ending the violence face are very clear. The issue of firearm
regulation evokes passionate responses from people on both sides of the debate,
and the firearms industry and others heavily fund the gun-rights lobby.  However, there is common ground. Millions of
Americans support universal background checks, mandatory storage restrictions,
and tighter regulation of gun dealers. FUNRA will seek progress in these areas.
We believe that, by targeting areas of agreement, we can affect actual legislative
change. The people of this country cannot continue to allow politicians on both
sides of the aisle to block regulations supported by the majority of Americans.

You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Contributing is not the only way you can support the creation of
the Firearms Undoubtedly Need Regulation Association. Please take a moment to spread
the word about FUNRA by sharing our campaign with your friends and contacts.

<p>We are organizers in the current movement for the Liberation of all Black people with a sense of optimism around the possibilities of political education and story sharing - if we can just get those stories and those ideas out there. </p>
<p>In January of 2019 LEFT OUT Magazine was conceptualized by activists, writers and organizers activated by and embedded in the Black Live Matter Movement - the latest explosion of Black Struggle in the last 50 years. It was our participation within this struggle for Black liberation, and in broader struggles for greater labor rights, within the electoral arena, and against the ravages of capitalism, that brought us in closer to a younger and diverse array of working class and poor Black people. The founders of LEFT OUT recognize that these Black folks in particular are seeking to narrate their own struggle for themselves, but have few platforms set up for serious debate and discussion. Left Out Magazine seeks to provide the space for the voices of a new generation of Leftist working class Black people, anti-racist activists and Black political thinkers.</p>
<p><strong>OUR PROGRESS</strong></p>
<p>In the past 4 months we have set up our editorial board, brought on a videographer and web designer, and continue to receive contributions from writers, poets, and political satirists, and academics, and activists engaged in struggle on the ground in their respective locales.</p>
<p>We have been humbled and heartened by the contributions we have gotten from supporters so far.  We are equally motivated by words of support and recognition of the importance of independent left Black publications and journalism in the current global political state of affairs.</p>
<p>So, we're happy to report that we are currently in pre-production for our first interview with plans for two additional video productions.  We have also started development of our website.  On December 3rd we will be launching our second phase of fundraising with fundraisers in cities across the country for Giving Tuesday.  So keep spreading the word, and keep an eye out for us!  </p>
<p>Left OUT magazine seeks to create more space for a new generation of Black working class and poor leftists, antiracist activists, political thinkers, and intellectuals.  By providing a space for the stories, experiences, and political and cultural analysis of Black working class people to marry with anti-racist, Black Leftist political thought on paper and online literature, we can challenge each other in our communities and challenge the status quo. Black people define culture socially and politically and LEFT OUT will be a tool for us to claim that space. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>To fund the publication of our magazine - which is the cost of production, shipping, and most importantly paying our contributing writers, videographer and website development - we are raising $3,000 starting this Giving Tuesday through February 2020.   </p>
<p>Anyone who donates will receive the first issue of LEFT OUT and their name in the acknowledgements section of the publication. Want to contribute, but not necessarily interested in receiving a copy of the magazine? Reach out to us about donating your issue or subscription. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>

</div></div>","We are organizers in the current movement for the Liberation of all Black people with a sense of optimism around the possibilities of political education and story sharing - if we can just get those stories and those ideas out there. 
In January of 2019 LEFT OUT Magazine was conceptualized by activists, writers and organizers activated by and embedded in the Black Live Matter Movement - the latest explosion of Black Struggle in the last 50 years. It was our participation within this struggle for Black liberation, and in broader struggles for greater labor rights, within the electoral arena, and against the ravages of capitalism, that brought us in closer to a younger and diverse array of working class and poor Black people. The founders of LEFT OUT recognize that these Black folks in particular are seeking to narrate their own struggle for themselves, but have few platforms set up for serious debate and discussion. Left Out Magazine seeks to provide the space for the voices of a new generation of Leftist working class Black people, anti-racist activists and Black political thinkers.
OUR PROGRESS
In the past 4 months we have set up our editorial board, brought on a videographer and web designer, and continue to receive contributions from writers, poets, and political satirists, and academics, and activists engaged in struggle on the ground in their respective locales.
We have been humbled and heartened by the contributions we have gotten from supporters so far.  We are equally motivated by words of support and recognition of the importance of independent left Black publications and journalism in the current global political state of affairs.
So, we're happy to report that we are currently in pre-production for our first interview with plans for two additional video productions.  We have also started development of our website.  On December 3rd we will be launching our second phase of fundraising with fundraisers in cities across the country for Giving Tuesday.  So keep spreading the word, and keep an eye out for us!  
Left OUT magazine seeks to create more space for a new generation of Black working class and poor leftists, antiracist activists, political thinkers, and intellectuals.  By providing a space for the stories, experiences, and political and cultural analysis of Black working class people to marry with anti-racist, Black Leftist political thought on paper and online literature, we can challenge each other in our communities and challenge the status quo. Black people define culture socially and politically and LEFT OUT will be a tool for us to claim that space. 
What We Need & What You Get
To fund the publication of our magazine - which is the cost of production, shipping, and most importantly paying our contributing writers, videographer and website development - we are raising $3,000 starting this Giving Tuesday through February 2020.   
Anyone who donates will receive the first issue of LEFT OUT and their name in the acknowledgements section of the publication. Want to contribute, but not necessarily interested in receiving a copy of the magazine? Reach out to us about donating your issue or subscription. 
The Impact
For us, LEFT OUT Magazine follows a long line of Black left publications (like ""The Crisis"", and ""The Crusader""). LEFT OUT  attempts to provide more independent space for the an array of Black working class and poor people to find one another, debate, and converse in order to advance the struggle for Black Liberation and the liberation of the entire working class and poor from capitalism.  From the ideas shared by poets, writers, and academics to reporting the stories of everyday experiences and struggles of working and poor Black people LEFT OUT Magazine seeks to be a bridge between ideas and struggle, influencing the conversations between Black people and contribute to grass roots struggle.

<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong></p>
<p>Most books on starting a business or on entrepreneurship are dry. At best, they're exciting if you're fascinated (as I am) about how people become successful. This book is different. It's about adventure, both inside and outside the entrepreneurial world. </p>
<p>There's none of the airy theorizing that characterizes most business books. Instead, you get step-by-step actionable advice for every stage of building your business. Keshav's observation of successes and failures and philosophy is that everything is a learning experience, even if you're not sure where you're headed. </p>
<p><strong>Why It's Worth Reading: </strong><br/>Three reasons.</p>
<p>First, the book provides an insider's view of serial entrepreneurship and the adaptation of the mind required for the transition to occur. Stop rushing into entrepreneurship born from half-baked ideas, misguided theories, and other forms of self-delusion based on motivational speakers. </p>
<p>Second, while this book is positioned as advice for people considering a shift into the entrepreneurial world, it's also a manifesto for a new way of thinking about the environment juxtaposing concepts with common familiar themes such as parenting, marriage, growing up and funerals.</p>
<p>Third, it is fun, at the author's expense.</p>
<p><strong>Best Quotes: </strong></p>
<p>""Entrepreneurship is a marathon of marathons""</p>
<p>""It's a trap""</p>
<p>""The pain of regret is many times more than the pain of failure""</p>
<p><strong>The themes:</strong></p>
<p>1.      When does one bootstrap a business? a.k.a. Stories from the “Thrift“</p>
<p>2.      How does one transition from a corporate career into the entrepreneurial world? a.k.a. Stories from the “Shift”</p>
<p>3.      How dealing with business partners is the same as Marriage? a.k.a. Stories from the “Rift“</p>
<p>4.      When does one start a business? a.k.a. Stories from the “Lift“</p>
<p>5.      When does one bury a business? a.k.a. Stories from the “Crypt“</p>
<p>6.      How building and running businesses is SIMILAR to Parenting? a.k.a. Stories from the “Pffffft“</p>
<p>7.      Mental health issues that entrepreneurs face in light of the challenges and how the Dad jokes get worse? (Evident from the Dad jokes)</p>
<p><strong>More about the author:</strong></p>
<p>Chennakeshav (Keshav) Adya is a versatile and resourceful business and technology professional with 20+ years of international corporate and entrepreneurial experience in building firms across sectors from a concept and leading global teams of 200+ spanning corporate finance advisory, international growth, M&amp;A, technology delivery and fund-raising. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">My Story. Why did I write the book?</h2>
<p><strong>What is the scariest thing that can happen to you after getting married?</strong> – Once upon a time you get aware that you are unhappy because you’ve really made a<strong> mistake</strong>.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it’s just a passing thought that you will hurriedly brush off convincing yourself that everything is OK. But, then you start thinking: the<strong> love </strong>you had in the beginning <strong>has gone</strong>, and the only one <strong>person</strong> you could spend all your time with is <strong>no longer interesting</strong>.</p>
<p>And, even the <strong>sex is no good anymore,</strong> your fantasies remain only fantasies. Once you wanted diversity and tried to change something, but you yielded and left those desires untold.</p>
<p>After several years you suddenly realize that <strong>your dreams are still dreams</strong>, and you are no longer the same as you used to be.</p>
<p>This realization makes you think: what’s next? – Give up everything and start all over again or allow yourself to make your dreams come true… with someone else.</p>
<p>Both options are frightening. <strong>You want to be truly happy</strong>, but you don’t want to ruin safe relationships with your partner. Because you’ve been together for such a long time. If you get a <strong>divorce</strong>, is there any guarantee that the <strong>next relationship</strong> won’t end in the same way?</p>
<p>Calm down, you are not the only one. <strong>Over 50% of married women feel exactly the same.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why a lot of families often fight, experience depressions, betrayals, and divorces – all those things that a happy woman shouldn’t pass through.</p>
<p><strong>What about your dreams?</strong></p>
<p>In childhood we usually have tremendous dreams, but when we get older, we happen to wake up and realize that life is quite different. It is filled with notorious daily chores instead of bright colors.</p>
<p>For example, have you ever dreamt about opening your own company, become a prima ballerina, travel around the world, or live in a house at the seaside? I have.</p>
<p><strong>Dreams may change, but the question is if we make them come true or just keep dreaming?</strong></p>
<p>In fact, all my life before getting married was filled with dreams and ambitions. I wanted a lot of things. But gradually, dreams became only dreams separated by a thick wall from the reality.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever wished, just once, to start all over?</strong> <strong>With another person and in another place? Have you ever thought as I did that you married too early, and your life is not the kind of life you dreamt of? Have you ever felt that the passion in your relationship died, you got only common daily life instead, and there is nothing more between you two than just a habit mistakenly called love?</strong></p>
<p>My life used to be routine, it was like in many other families: home – work – home, walking, going to the cinema, visiting friends on the weekends, and sex twice a week.</p>
<p>I was always taught to be a carrying and wise wife and to take care of the house. But nobody has ever told me that to achieve all those things you should keep silent and suffer as much as possible.</p>
<p>That time I didn’t know that sex is very important, and that your partner should be both a good handyman and a good lover that can light up your fire at any time. That diversity should be everywhere in your kitchen and in your bed.</p>
<p>Just imagine, even before you’ve decided to say no to all your dreams, lock up all your desires and forget about them once and for all, it happens as if someone has heard you yelling for help, and <strong>a person, who changes everything, appears in your life</strong>.  </p>
<p>When something like that happened to me, my life was split into two worlds, two realities, and <strong>I had to make my choice</strong>. To stay with someone reliable and tested with years, support, family, friends. Where everything is familiar. Or to jump into the abyss, hoping to grow wings while falling…</p>
<p>  You are sure this man will make you different, and you will be yourself and real. <strong>You can make all your dreams come true, and you don’t have to be scared of failures, as you always have another try any time. He will support you. He will be with you.</strong></p>
<p>You get aware that you will be able to overcome your fears and family’s pressure by realizing your dreams and wished. You have this right! You deserve much more than you have now!</p>
<p>Why have I decided to share this story with the whole world? It wasn’t easy. <strong>The society judges everyone who doesn’t follow its rules. </strong>At first, I shared it with my closest friends, and they shared it with theirs, presenting this story as an example that everything is possible in this life, it is never too late to start all over again. One of them dared to move abroad, another one to break up relations being like a cage for her.</p>
<p>My story tells you <strong>how to find courage to leave the comfort zone</strong>, <strong>how to get strong enough to make an important step</strong>. This is a story about <strong>passion</strong> that never fades away but burns brighter with each year. The story showing how a grey and dull life can turn into life of your dreams. Your age and status do not matter, it is not important where you live, what you do and how you look like. A clean slate is the same for anyone.</p>
<p>I dreamt about writing a book, but everyone used to tell me that I am just a journalist, and it was impossible. But here I am, I’ve written a book. Exactly about the things restraining me and many other married women that I know.</p>
<p>I met my love and like-minded person, with whom I managed to realize myself in all the spheres, despite the fact that I married the wrong man in the beginning.</p>
<p>I kept good relationship with friends, family and even with my ex-husband. By the way, he was also able to build a new happy relationship taking into account the mistakes of the past. Both his and my lives changed for the good.</p>
<p>Today I’ve stopped envying people who make their dreams come true, because now I know everything really depends on me.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to know more about keeping the flame burning in the relationship and avoid cheating,</strong> <strong>how to stay desirable for your partner, how to get everything you have ever dreamt of and find courage to go against the rules, help me make my book available in the English language as well.</strong></p>
<p>A mysterious stranger that came into my life wasn’t just good luck, it was my desire and readiness to get changed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, everything depends only on you.</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<p>Passion is the key ingredient to make everything in life meaningful. It’s a fundamental part of love, family, hobbies, work and dreams. There’s nothing you can successfully achieve without passion – and that’s the key ingredient of ‘In a Free Fall. Manipulator’. That’s why it has been changing the lives of so many women. The two interconnected books, which readers can choose in which order to read, tell a story of repressed passions that were released by the spark of a man who has greatly impacted my life, encouraging me to overcome my fears and doubts and reclaim the command of my destiny.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">About the novel “In a free fall. Manipulator”</h2>
<p>Originally written in Russian, many women have seen themselves in Christine, the book’s main character. Christine once wanted to be a famous journalist and write about the most beautiful places in the world, but she ended up selling lifeless diamonds in a trading center. Her dreams of fame were limited to a not very popular blog, and, while she hated routine, she got married at 24 to a life where each and every one of her dreams was sacrificed for the sake of the home and the family. As much as she didn’t like it, she coped with being patronized and controlled, she accepted jealousy, and she got used to live a life where her true self was crushed every day.</p>
<p>That was until she met the one man that was going to make her shatter all that rotten stability that she fought so hard to maintain… while hating it. And so she did. Enamored by his inspiring confidence, ambition and daring ways, she fell in love with a man who didn’t care about rules or conventions. She found a lover that fulfilled every desire that she could ever have, and who was the living example of the kind of liberty that Christine had always wanted to live by.</p>
<p>The choice wasn’t easy, though. Should a stable, robust and family-driven relationship take priority over an adventurous chain-breaking relationship with a man that truly wanted to see Christine being happy and free on her own terms? What would friends and family members think? How would one husband react? How would this new love behave, once she took that step? How would she transition from a repressed soul into a free spirit?</p>
<p> </p>

<p><i>Lada Goldin! THANK YOU for this very useful and wonderful publication. Each woman should remember that nobody has TWO LIVES. It is THIS LIFE that YOU have to live AS YOU THINK it should be, without thinking about what other people could say. It is NEVER late to start AGAIN!!!</i></p>

<p><i>Unfortunately, your story came to an end… It filled me with pleasure and happiness, as I became aware that dreams are something so important in my life. It does not matter what other people think and say about them, whether they approve or disprove me for them… now I know I have to value every second and situation of my life. Well, we all understand that, but we rarely do it. I would like to follow this rule in my life and never forget it! Your story gave me warmth and showed light at the end of the tunnel. I was so absorbed in reading that heartfelt joy or fear, always wishing to know what was coming next. Frankly speaking, my heart stopped beating when I was reading about some situations… actually, I was still in this emotional state long after I stopped reading. The book is fabulous, you described everything with so many details, and it was wonderful! BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO! It goes without saying, I will read your book again!))). I am looking forward to your new story! By all means inform me about your new publication!</i></p>

</div></div>","My Story. Why did I write the book?
What is the scariest thing that can happen to you after getting married? – Once upon a time you get aware that you are unhappy because you’ve really made a mistake.
Perhaps, it’s just a passing thought that you will hurriedly brush off convincing yourself that everything is OK. But, then you start thinking: the love you had in the beginning has gone, and the only one person you could spend all your time with is no longer interesting.
And, even the sex is no good anymore, your fantasies remain only fantasies. Once you wanted diversity and tried to change something, but you yielded and left those desires untold.
After several years you suddenly realize that your dreams are still dreams, and you are no longer the same as you used to be.
This realization makes you think: what’s next? – Give up everything and start all over again or allow yourself to make your dreams come true… with someone else.
Both options are frightening. You want to be truly happy, but you don’t want to ruin safe relationships with your partner. Because you’ve been together for such a long time. If you get a divorce, is there any guarantee that the next relationship won’t end in the same way?
Calm down, you are not the only one. Over 50% of married women feel exactly the same.
That’s why a lot of families often fight, experience depressions, betrayals, and divorces – all those things that a happy woman shouldn’t pass through.
What about your dreams?
In childhood we usually have tremendous dreams, but when we get older, we happen to wake up and realize that life is quite different. It is filled with notorious daily chores instead of bright colors.
For example, have you ever dreamt about opening your own company, become a prima ballerina, travel around the world, or live in a house at the seaside? I have.
Dreams may change, but the question is if we make them come true or just keep dreaming?
In fact, all my life before getting married was filled with dreams and ambitions. I wanted a lot of things. But gradually, dreams became only dreams separated by a thick wall from the reality.
Have you ever wished, just once, to start all over? With another person and in another place? Have you ever thought as I did that you married too early, and your life is not the kind of life you dreamt of? Have you ever felt that the passion in your relationship died, you got only common daily life instead, and there is nothing more between you two than just a habit mistakenly called love?
My life used to be routine, it was like in many other families: home – work – home, walking, going to the cinema, visiting friends on the weekends, and sex twice a week.
I was always taught to be a carrying and wise wife and to take care of the house. But nobody has ever told me that to achieve all those things you should keep silent and suffer as much as possible.
That time I didn’t know that sex is very important, and that your partner should be both a good handyman and a good lover that can light up your fire at any time. That diversity should be everywhere in your kitchen and in your bed.
Just imagine, even before you’ve decided to say no to all your dreams, lock up all your desires and forget about them once and for all, it happens as if someone has heard you yelling for help, and a person, who changes everything, appears in your life.  
When something like that happened to me, my life was split into two worlds, two realities, and I had to make my choice. To stay with someone reliable and tested with years, support, family, friends. Where everything is familiar. Or to jump into the abyss, hoping to grow wings while falling…
  You are sure this man will make you different, and you will be yourself and real. You can make all your dreams come true, and you don’t have to be scared of failures, as you always have another try any time. He will support you. He will be with you.
You get aware that you will be able to overcome your fears and family’s pressure by realizing your dreams and wished. You have this right! You deserve much more than you have now!
Why have I decided to share this story with the whole world? It wasn’t easy. The society judges everyone who doesn’t follow its rules. At first, I shared it with my closest friends, and they shared it with theirs, presenting this story as an example that everything is possible in this life, it is never too late to start all over again. One of them dared to move abroad, another one to break up relations being like a cage for her.
My story tells you how to find courage to leave the comfort zone, how to get strong enough to make an important step. This is a story about passion that never fades away but burns brighter with each year. The story showing how a grey and dull life can turn into life of your dreams. Your age and status do not matter, it is not important where you live, what you do and how you look like. A clean slate is the same for anyone.
I dreamt about writing a book, but everyone used to tell me that I am just a journalist, and it was impossible. But here I am, I’ve written a book. Exactly about the things restraining me and many other married women that I know.
I met my love and like-minded person, with whom I managed to realize myself in all the spheres, despite the fact that I married the wrong man in the beginning.
I kept good relationship with friends, family and even with my ex-husband. By the way, he was also able to build a new happy relationship taking into account the mistakes of the past. Both his and my lives changed for the good.
Today I’ve stopped envying people who make their dreams come true, because now I know everything really depends on me.
If you want to know more about keeping the flame burning in the relationship and avoid cheating, how to stay desirable for your partner, how to get everything you have ever dreamt of and find courage to go against the rules, help me make my book available in the English language as well.
A mysterious stranger that came into my life wasn’t just good luck, it was my desire and readiness to get changed.
Ultimately, everything depends only on you.
 


Passion is the key ingredient to make everything in life meaningful. It’s a fundamental part of love, family, hobbies, work and dreams. There’s nothing you can successfully achieve without passion – and that’s the key ingredient of ‘In a Free Fall. Manipulator’. That’s why it has been changing the lives of so many women. The two interconnected books, which readers can choose in which order to read, tell a story of repressed passions that were released by the spark of a man who has greatly impacted my life, encouraging me to overcome my fears and doubts and reclaim the command of my destiny.
About the novel “In a free fall. Manipulator”
Originally written in Russian, many women have seen themselves in Christine, the book’s main character. Christine once wanted to be a famous journalist and write about the most beautiful places in the world, but she ended up selling lifeless diamonds in a trading center. Her dreams of fame were limited to a not very popular blog, and, while she hated routine, she got married at 24 to a life where each and every one of her dreams was sacrificed for the sake of the home and the family. As much as she didn’t like it, she coped with being patronized and controlled, she accepted jealousy, and she got used to live a life where her true self was crushed every day.
That was until she met the one man that was going to make her shatter all that rotten stability that she fought so hard to maintain… while hating it. And so she did. Enamored by his inspiring confidence, ambition and daring ways, she fell in love with a man who didn’t care about rules or conventions. She found a lover that fulfilled every desire that she could ever have, and who was the living example of the kind of liberty that Christine had always wanted to live by.
The choice wasn’t easy, though. Should a stable, robust and family-driven relationship take priority over an adventurous chain-breaking relationship with a man that truly wanted to see Christine being happy and free on her own terms? What would friends and family members think? How would one husband react? How would this new love behave, once she took that step? How would she transition from a repressed soul into a free spirit?
 

I’m sure that, just like I once felt, you need the right dose of motivation to live the life you were meant to live. You know that life as you’ve lived it this far is nothing like what you dreamed for you, but you also know that the fear of change is beyond intimidating. More than reading self-help messages that no one ever really puts in practice, you feel that you need real-life examples that can prompt you into creating meaningful change. You know that this will give you the kind of confidence and encouragement that no vague idea can.
What are the benefits of the book?
So these are all reasons for you to read this book. It will help you to visualize how you could make this kind of change in your life. It will help you to understand the peculiarities of male and female logics, and how the thought process differs so strikingly in both genders. It will help you to be certain that your thoughts, doubts and wishes are correct, and that you have every right to act upon them.
The reason why I am sure that ‘In a Free Fall. Manipulation’ will help you is because hundreds of women have told me so. They read it in Russian, in the book’s original version, and they told me how much it changed their lives. They told me that I had to have it published in English, so that more women’s lives could be changed. 

And that’s exactly what I am inviting you to do – help me change your life while also helping other women to change theirs. That’s why I am seeking to raise $67,000 to:
Where will funds go?

We have all the contacts for printing, distribution, delivery, and all the other elements necessary to make this a successful project, but we are turning to crowdsourcing the funds for this to mitigate our risk and evaluate interest in an independently published story book. If this works, there will be more!As such, we'll say it one more time: this project is either fully funded (which strictly covers our production costs) or it won't move forward. Out of fairness to all involved, any funds collected will be returned to the funders if we don't hit our goal.This itself is a bit risky on the ""other side of the coin"", because we believe this book deserves to be published but we are currently entirely dependent on meeting our fund raising goal.Let's do this!! Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't afford to contribute to the project but believe in Lefty and his message of joie de vivre, even if you smell like spoiled onions and stinky cheese, please feel free to share our campaign link on social media or with your friends and acquaintances! We would love to get a feeling for how much interest there is in the community at large is, so even if you can't contribute by all means... feel free to leave us an encouraging comment! And of course you can always pick up a copy once we've gone to print.Mostly we need help with getting the word out that there's an awesome project in the works... anything you can do to share it in the world would be appreciated!Thank you for reading and we'll see you on the flip side!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Deniz and I am a curious sociologist. Being a sociologist is one of my dreams and I am practising it willingly now. I conducted lots of Projects until now, especially on my favourite subjects; cinema, cinema and women, women silence on the cinema, old people, aging, youth, children and the relationship between children and elder people.</p>
<p>I wrote two books depending on my researches. First one is about an oral history research which I conducted for 4 years. I studied elder people with the Project. It drew my way for the second book. My second book is a fairytale book for children. This one is very important for me because I studied with elder people and children aged 4-7 together. It was an amazing and useful research for me. Thanks to it I learned lots of things and especially new and original tales from the elder people. That's why I decided to continue my research about the relationship between children and elder people. </p>
<p>Here is my first fairytale book: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505139803/x3eg3api8gmwmjkm7kpk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>Culture changes types of relationships and it worths to investigate. Every culture creates its own tales and the way of telling them to the next generations. I believe that the way of telling sth. or oral customs are the most important and simplest  way of tranferring the knowledge and experience. Thanks to my Project, Ubuntu, I intend to maintain these customs through listening fairy tales from the elder people. I did it in my country Turkey at first, and I will continue in various parts of the World. My next station will be United States of America. </p>
<p><strong>What 'UBUNTU' means?</strong></p>
<p>When I was thinking about how can I describe you the perspective of 'Ubuntu', I remembered a story. Here is the story and also the meaning of 'Ubuntu': </p>
<p><i>An antropologist proposed a game to the kids in an African tribe. He put a basket full of fruit near a tree and told the kids that who ever got there first won the sweet fruits. When he told them to run they they all took each others hands and ran together, then sat together enjoying their treats. When he asked them why they had run like that as one could have had all the fruits for himself they said: ""UBUNTU, how can one of us be happy if all the other ones are sad?""</i></p>
<p>UBUNTU means 'I am because we are'.  </p>
<p>I will proposed these type of games for the children and grandparents, and these times will be our UBUNTU sessions. </p>
<p><strong>How will the Project come true? </strong></p>
<p>Briefly, there are 3 main phases of the Project. </p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Conducting different meeting point with the elder people and children aged 4-7. (It can be at home, at school or at a nursing home.)</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Practising the Ubuntu sessions (In these sessions we all experience the motto 'I am because we are'). </p>
<p>I will observe the relationship between grandfathers-grandmothers and grandkids;</p>
<p>- How they play,</p>
<p>- How they communicate,</p>
<p>- Which subjects they talk.</p>
<p>I will ask for listening fairy tales with grandkids, and after that we will talk about it together.</p>
<p>- How the kids find the fairy tale,</p>
<p>- Listening a fairy tale is funny or boring,</p>
<p>- How they all analyze the relationship between each other and so on. </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Writing the aimed fairy tale book. (I will arrange the fairy tale that I heard from the elder people, the real story of them and the relationship between them. After that I will narrate my own fairy tales.) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Deniz and I am a curious sociologist. Being a sociologist is one of my dreams and I am practising it willingly now. I conducted lots of Projects until now, especially on my favourite subjects; cinema, cinema and women, women silence on the cinema, old people, aging, youth, children and the relationship between children and elder people.
I wrote two books depending on my researches. First one is about an oral history research which I conducted for 4 years. I studied elder people with the Project. It drew my way for the second book. My second book is a fairytale book for children. This one is very important for me because I studied with elder people and children aged 4-7 together. It was an amazing and useful research for me. Thanks to it I learned lots of things and especially new and original tales from the elder people. That's why I decided to continue my research about the relationship between children and elder people. 
Here is my first fairytale book: 
 
Culture changes types of relationships and it worths to investigate. Every culture creates its own tales and the way of telling them to the next generations. I believe that the way of telling sth. or oral customs are the most important and simplest  way of tranferring the knowledge and experience. Thanks to my Project, Ubuntu, I intend to maintain these customs through listening fairy tales from the elder people. I did it in my country Turkey at first, and I will continue in various parts of the World. My next station will be United States of America. 
What 'UBUNTU' means?
When I was thinking about how can I describe you the perspective of 'Ubuntu', I remembered a story. Here is the story and also the meaning of 'Ubuntu': 
An antropologist proposed a game to the kids in an African tribe. He put a basket full of fruit near a tree and told the kids that who ever got there first won the sweet fruits. When he told them to run they they all took each others hands and ran together, then sat together enjoying their treats. When he asked them why they had run like that as one could have had all the fruits for himself they said: ""UBUNTU, how can one of us be happy if all the other ones are sad?""
UBUNTU means 'I am because we are'.  
I will proposed these type of games for the children and grandparents, and these times will be our UBUNTU sessions. 
How will the Project come true? 
Briefly, there are 3 main phases of the Project. 
1. Conducting different meeting point with the elder people and children aged 4-7. (It can be at home, at school or at a nursing home.)
2. Practising the Ubuntu sessions (In these sessions we all experience the motto 'I am because we are'). 
I will observe the relationship between grandfathers-grandmothers and grandkids;
- How they play,
- How they communicate,
- Which subjects they talk.
I will ask for listening fairy tales with grandkids, and after that we will talk about it together.
- How the kids find the fairy tale,
- Listening a fairy tale is funny or boring,
- How they all analyze the relationship between each other and so on. 
3. Writing the aimed fairy tale book. (I will arrange the fairy tale that I heard from the elder people, the real story of them and the relationship between them. After that I will narrate my own fairy tales.) 

What We Need & What You Get
Arranging  minimum 50 interviews is the main goal of the Project. The score of the interviews broaden diversity o the fairytales. 
It will continue 9 months. The interviews will be conducted in the first 6 months. Analyzing the interviews and writing the book will be at the last 3 months. 
All meeting's will be photographed, and they will be shared throughout the Project. So I will update followers frequently. These photographs will be also used in the book. 
The name of the book can be chosen with the contributors.
 
Where will the money go?
All the funding generated from this campaign will go directly towards the travel requirements, editing, proofreading, rewards, supplies and support staff to complete the project. The most pressing financial needs are meeting the enormous burden of travelling and transcribing the interview content. I live in İstanbul, and I need to travel and live in the USA for 6 months. It is hard for me to cover all of the expenses.

<h3>The Cause:</h3>
<p>Enable our daughters to discover the truth about themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>who they are</li>
<li>how God defines and determines their worth and value</li>
<li>walk out the destiny God has purposed for each one of them</li>
<li>understand the proper definition of truth, love, and beauty</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Purpose:</h3>
<p>Bring the life transforming truth of God to our girls in a non-threatening, easy to read, thought provoking format. Each chapter exposes a specific lie, prompts them to search their hearts, journal, and motivates them to take action. Each step sets them free of the lies, misconceptions and faulty thought patterns that have enslaved us. I expect, and fervently pray, this new found freedom will serve as a catalyst, fueling their passion to become everything God purposed them to be. As the truth soaks into the hearts and minds of our girls, they will have the confidence to walk into this deceptive world  armed and empowered to influence rather than be influenced and leave their indelible mark in this world.</p>
<p>Sadly the majority of our girls lack the confidence, self esteem and courage they need to accept and believe in themselves. Having worked as a youth leader, I saw first hand how most strive to fit into the world's definition of beauty, success, and confidence.  My suspisions proved true when I surveyed girls for this book. The girls surveyed all attended church, youth groups, retreats, and/or christian schools. Most of them did not know:</p>
<ul>
<li>How God defines them and what that means for them</li>
<li>Why they are valuable and what determines that</li>
<li>Feel beautiful and confident</li>
<li>Understand that they have a purpose and destiny </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the majority do not believe in absolutes. These are girls growing up in Christian environments across denominational lines, imagine those with little or no exposure to truth?!?! </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Give rise to a generation of confident and empowered women influencing the world instead of the world influencing them.</p>
<p>By defining and describing love, truth, beauty, the voice of God, the voice of the Enemy and the voices of society, family, friends/peers, religion, media (music, books, magazines, TV, and movies) and social media we provide our girls with a solid foundation they can build upon. </p>
<p>Imagine if every youth group in the whole world set out to spend a few weeks studying with our girls these life transforming truths. I see chains breaking off, walls tumbling down, spiritual eyes being opened, hearts being mended, the brokenhearted restored, the lost found, the weak strengthened and empowered, the rejected accepted, the hurting comforted, and the captive set free. We would see revival. </p>
<p>However, this will only happen if we teach our girls truth. Without truth they cannot recognize the lies, deceptions and misconceptions they have accepted as truth and is wreaking havoc in their lives.</p>
<p>How do I know this will work? Because I am living proof that God's word is alive, active, powerful and will not return void or empty. The truth of who I am, what that means to me and for me is giving me the courage I need to face whatever comes my way. I know that I know, that my failures, past mistakes, people's opinions, weaknesses, successes, accomplishments and triumphs do not define me. God does!!! Grasping that truth is life transforming and liberating. I want my girls to know this and live it out! I want all women to know it and live it out! I want to invade the enemy's territory and take back what he has stolen from us. Do you want that for your daughters? I do!!! Therefore, with God's help and anointing, I will do everything in my power to get the truth out. Will you help me?</p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
</div><div>
<p>I say we because I cannot do this on my own. My biggest obstacle is the finances. No surprise right, or I wouldn't be here. However, I don't just need or want money. Shocked?!?! Curious?!?!</p>
<p>Good, allow me to explain.</p>
<p>I've heard many stories about how promising ventures with healthy budgets have failed miserably due to inexperience. I don't want to be one of them. I've also heard how great projects have never come to fruition due to the lack of finances. I don't want that to happen to me. I'm not naive, I know I can't do it all, nor do I want to. So here's what I really want:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prayer: I don't want anything God doesn't want for me. Therefore, I sincerely covet your prayers. More than anything, I want this book to transform lives. Who cares if I sell hundreds of thousands of copies and lives are not changed for the better. I am not interested in being entertaining, sounding intelligent or as if I have it all together - because I don't, I'm still a work in progress. I am not interested in becoming famous and rich (Lord knows that is the last thing I want.) What I really and truly want is to see a generation transformed, armed, and empowered to invade the enemy's territory to take our promised land. This cannot be accomplished in my own strength. I need God, which means I need your prayers so that I stay focused and in tune to what the Holy Spirit tells me. Please cover this project, my life and family in your prayers because if God is not going with me, I'm not going. I don't want to meet my creator and have him say to me that my book was a financial success but a spiritual failure. I want to hear him say it was a spiritual success and show me how it transformed the lives of many.</li>
<li>
<u><strong>Experts:</strong></u><strong> </strong>I am looking for people who are willing to use their talents and expertise in networking, marketing, social media, publishing, graphic design, videography, photography, sales, public relations and advertising  to help me out. Imagine how your services can be an invaluable help to this project. Using your talents to impact the lives of so many in this world will not only be rewarding in this life but in the next to come. Not all of us are called to go, but we are all called to send and sending does not always mean giving money.</li>
<li>
<u><strong>Money:</strong></u> If someone steps up to the plate in each of the above categories, I don't think I'll need any money. Seriously, as that's what the money will be going towards. However, If I need to fill those shoes, with God's grace and help, I'm up for the challenge. My goal will be to raise at least $10,000. </li>
</ol>
<p>The money raised will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>professional book editing (as you may have noticed, my grammar can use the help ;-)</li>
<li>a graphic designer to take my word document and create the book's layout as a PDF document to the printer's specification and layout the design cover according to the printer's specifications. </li>
<li>a social media expert to produce and ensure the success of quality and engaging posts geared specifically towards parents, youth leaders and our girls on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, and Facebook.</li>
<li>marketing - I would like to hire a book publicist who can coordinate interviews (both print and broadcast) and handle public relations. I will need the help of someone who knows how to contact the right people and bring attention to the book using proven channels. This will deplete a significant part of the budget if no one steps up.</li>
<li>advertising - most of this will go towards sponsoring ads in social media, rather than traditional advertising. However, some will go towards banner ads on christian sites</li>
<li>a website</li>
<li>a photographer </li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><u><i><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong></i></u> At the risk of sounding ignorant, I don't believe there is any risk. Allow me to explain. I say this because in the Fall of 2015 I published my first book, Journey to Faith - Through the Eyes of the Wise Men. I successfully brought that project to completion. I had never navigated the waters of self publishing before and would not allow my budget of $1,200 to deter me. With God's help I sold over 1,000 copies with no money for marketing, advertising, social media etc. My budget, if we can even call it that, allowed me to create a website through Wix (journeytofaithbook.com), under employ a very talented artist and graphic designer and pay for fees (ISBN numbers, copyrights, printing charges, etc.) </p>
<p>Although to many this may be considered a failure, I see it as a successful stepping stone. Finding an agent for a seasonal children's story is impossible. The season is short and the market too small, they are not interested. When that door closed, I walked into self publishing. Although the odds were stacked against me,  I hadn't heard of crowdfunding and all I had was $1,200, I went ahead and published my book. After all was said and done, my Facebook page had more than 400 likes, my Goodreads profile had a 4.71 out of 5 book rating, and I sold approximately 1,000 copies of Journey to Faith, all while actually making a profit. Imagine what we can accomplish together now that I am more experienced and with your financial backing!</p>
<p><u><i><strong>Challenges:</strong></i></u><i><strong> </strong></i>I believe the greatest challenge is finances. However, not raising the money will not prevent me from completing this project it will only slow down my time table. It will take me a lot longer to get the word out as I will again have no budget for marketing, advertising or social media. However, having walked this road before only serves to make me more confident that, with God's help, I will accomplish the desire he has hidden in my heart. Since this is not a seasonal book, my efforts will not lose momentum and will ultimately produce a snowball effect. Please do not confuse my confidence with arrogance. I just know I have a struck a nerve with this subject and that God's word is liberating. The passion burning in my soul is fueled by the redemptive work God has done in my life. Therefore, nothing is going to stop me from getting this message out. Whatever happens, I am confident that he is in control. As long as he is, my time and effort will not be wasted  and should you partner with me, neither will yours --- ultimately, that is what matters most.</p>

I had never navigated the waters of self publishing before and would not allow my budget of $1,200 to deter me. With God's help I sold over 1,000 copies with no money for marketing, advertising, social media etc. My budget, if we can even call it that, allowed me to create a website through Wix (journeytofaithbook.com), under employ a very talented artist and graphic designer and pay for fees (ISBN numbers, copyrights, printing charges, etc.) 
Although to many this may be considered a failure, I see it as a successful stepping stone. Finding an agent for a seasonal children's story is impossible. The season is short and the market too small, they are not interested. When that door closed, I walked into self publishing. Although the odds were stacked against me,  I hadn't heard of crowdfunding and all I had was $1,200, I went ahead and published my book. After all was said and done, my Facebook page had more than 400 likes, my Goodreads profile had a 4.71 out of 5 book rating, and I sold approximately 1,000 copies of Journey to Faith, all while actually making a profit. Imagine what we can accomplish together now that I am more experienced and with your financial backing!
Challenges: I believe the greatest challenge is finances. However, not raising the money will not prevent me from completing this project it will only slow down my time table. It will take me a lot longer to get the word out as I will again have no budget for marketing, advertising or social media. However, having walked this road before only serves to make me more confident that, with God's help, I will accomplish the desire he has hidden in my heart. Since this is not a seasonal book, my efforts will not lose momentum and will ultimately produce a snowball effect. Please do not confuse my confidence with arrogance. I just know I have a struck a nerve with this subject and that God's word is liberating. The passion burning in my soul is fueled by the redemptive work God has done in my life. Therefore, nothing is going to stop me from getting this message out. Whatever happens, I am confident that he is in control. As long as he is, my time and effort will not be wasted  and should you partner with me, neither will yours --- ultimately, that is what matters most.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>THE WRITER</h3>
<p>I am a science-fiction/fantasy writer from Cluj-Napoca, located in Transylvania, Romania. I am married and have 4 children. Even though I have started writing during my childhood a few novellas and short stories, this is the first full-length novel I intend to publish. To me writing has always had a cathartic effect; the images, stories and characters live within me, my life goes on simultaneously with that of my characters; I can feel their will, their motivations and desires as they flow through me and make me live a parallel life alongside them. The worlds in which my characters exist is every bit as real as the world in which we live.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>THE NOVEL</h3>
<p>The „Black Pigeon” novel was initially imagined as an initiation journey, both for the writer and those behind the characters and of course the readers. In unconventional fashion, the novel has 7 of its characters guided by real people, who act as avatars in the world of Black Pigeon. Being an interactive novel, each of the 7 characters can partially influence the story, with the author only controlling the overall storyline and the secondary characters. The characters „grow” as the action unfolds and can transform and evolve in order to meet the challenges which lay ahead. The novel is also a consecration journey for myself, a necessary and welcome metanoia, as Sagrada Familia was for Gaudi. Similar to the genius architect, I envision the abstract form of the novel, its basic structure made from interfering forces which can converge or divide. Its final structure will be a journey of discovery, growth and metamorphosis for all involved, myself included.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is the novel actually about?</h3>
<p>If we are to boil down the story, it is about a small group of friends who in the year 2223 are part of a little known organization, known as The Protectors of Igfon. The story revolves around them and around the adventures they go through in an attempt to solve seemingly impossible mysteries. One of these mysteries is The Black Pigeon, a woman possessing special paranormal abilities and whose aura awakens in those around her a sharp feeling of guilt and remorse, reminding them of their own sins and mistakes. The most serious effect is manifested in those who spend too much time around her, as they risk going insane or committing suicide. The small group, the generic party if you will, tries to uncover why such an entity is present on Earth and how they could go about stopping the negative effects she has to those around her. As the novel starts out in an easily-understandable fashion, I have decided to keep the cryptic and intricate stories towards the end in a not too sudden but constant crescendo, until such time that all the secrets are revealed in a more-or-less explicit fashion.</p>

<h3>Why am I writing this novel?</h3>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the field of futurology, by those who have the gift of presenting a possible future and a science-fiction novel is the perfect opportunity to dabble in the multitude of  possibilities. The future presented in this novel is an amplified one, as during the 200 years which have passed, the problems of today’s world have multiplied and become more serious. The world of The Black Pigeon is the scene of intense fighting between various organizations, each with a strong desire for power and control over the population, in both the real and virtual worlds. In this world, common sense is all but extinct and greed and exacerbated sexuality are common. It is a world which becomes more diluted with each passing day, becoming a sick mix of many small people who consider themselves to be outstanding. In many regards, today’s world is gradually shifting towards the one presented in The Black Pigeon. On the surface it appears interesting and appealing, but once you enter you discover it is faded and lacking the strength of sacred essences.</p>

<p>The second reason for writing this novel is the combination of science-fiction and fantasy, which beyond the obvious contrast, represents a challenge in itself. The science-fiction portion of The Black Pigeon stems from the environment and technology of the world and the fantasy portion is based on the link between the ancestral past and the highly technological future. Behind this revolution of the human ontological status are The Protectors of the Igfon (Igfon was the name of a sacred forest in the Apuseni Mountains, as attested in official records from the 9th and 10th centuries). They are the ones who are capable of establishing an essential connection between the sacred past and the technological present, being the keepers of ancient wisdom, hidden in myths and forgotten rituals kept only in small regions of ancient Dacia. One of these regions, known as Codru Moma (or The Woods of the Mother – Woods of the Mother of the Forest – an ancestral dendrological entity who supposedly rules the forests) is the home of the witches (chosen women, who are said to have been marked at birth by the forest entities and therefore gifted with special powers) and of the solomonari. The witches are the guardians of the feminine mysteries of birth and transformation, the ones who can tame the wilderness and make the world sacred. The „solomonari” are masters of the elements and holders of an enormous power through which they can command the elemental powers of nature, can heal or foresee the future. With the help of the Protectors of the Igfon this forgotten ancestral knowledge is integrated into the highly technological future, healing it and restoring its long-lost sacred meaning, which is in fact the basis of life itself.</p>

<p>This is what I wish from my novel – to bring a little ancestral magic in today`s world. I am not talking about spectacular magic, but about something much more tangible, something fundamental, rooted in a philosphical/religios/magical system possessing both mystical and practical traits.

I believe there is still a plethora of profound concepts that we no longer know and which can be restored and given back to humanity as to achieve an improved relationship between man and nature, as well as its own being. Ironically, modern man knows more about the non-European sacred aspects and mythology than about those which were the foundation of the Renaissance, Illuminism and modern culture.  There are numerous Eastern European folk tales which talk of myths, stories, songs, charms and proverbs which are completely unknown to modern man and could significantly enrich today’s world which finds itself at a lack of identity and purpose.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>City of Thieves - Fighting Fantasy Collector's Book</strong></u></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>YOU have played Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson’s Fighting Fantasy books before, but never like this!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Games Collector brings Ian Livingstone’s ‘City of Thieves’ Fighting Fantasy book vividly to life in this sumptuously presented limited edition hardback. Experience the adventure as it leaps off the page, thanks to the hand-crafted interactive features in this special edition of a gamebook classic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This limited hardback edition of ‘City of Thieves’ from The Games Collector will become a treasured and much sought-after addition to the world of Fighting Fantasy. It adds a new dimension to the Fighting Fantasy experience with the inclusion of interactive cardboard components. Decide your next action by opening envelopes or lifting flaps to uncover jewels, gold and other treasures needed to complete the adventure and defeat the villainous Zanbar Bone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488990222/re8wptidihcq4bepjvqm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>What is this new Limited Edition?</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The original ‘City of Thieves’ gamebook was published in 1983 as a standard paperback with black &amp; white interior illustrations. This new limited never-to-be-repeated edition from The Games Collector is presented in a larger, hardback format for the first time, and is full-colour, featuring entirely new illustrations. Also, for the first time in a Fighting Fantasy book, it includes physical envelopes and flaps to open, revealing the items, maps and letters you need to discover as you explore Port Blacksand. This offering comes with the full endorsement of Ian Livingstone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Bound and printed to the highest quality by a long-established and highly reputable UK firm, each Games Collector Edition book is hand-crafted (excluding the Hero edition). The pages are hand-stitched together rather than glued, allowing the opened book to lie flat without needing to be held. The additional items are individually fixed to the inside pages.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The prototype for this edition was created and illustrated by the Brazilian artist and designer Daielyn Cris Bertelli. Using her design for this limited edition, City of Thieves has never looked so good, and is available in two languages - English and Portuguese.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Please select the correct language version when pledging.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>What is Fighting Fantasy?</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Created by Ian Livingstone &amp; Steve Jackson, the Fighting Fantasy series of adventure gamebooks debuted in 1982 and has sold over 18 million copies worldwide. What started with ‘The Warlock of Firetop Mountain’ eventually spawned over 60 gamebooks, as well as board games and video games. As the 35th anniversary of Fighting Fantasy approaches, the legacy continues. This collector’s edition of City of Thieves is being published as part of a year-long celebration of the series which includes a brand new gamebook written by Ian Livingstone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Fighting Fantasy gamebooks are exactly that – part game and part book. These are books in which YOU, the reader, are the Hero. Armed with a pencil and dice, YOU choose which paths to follow, which items to take, and which creatures to battle! However - as in real life - sometimes fate will decide for you. Read a passage from the story and then decide whether to turn left or right, talk to that little old man or fight him. Test you LUCK to see if you can steal the pouch from around the sleeping pirate's neck - or will he wake up? Do you have the STAMINA to fight the Serpent Queen? Do you have the SKILL needed to hit an assassin with your throwing knife? Will you survive?</p>

</div></div>","City of Thieves - Fighting Fantasy Collector's Book
 
YOU have played Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson’s Fighting Fantasy books before, but never like this!
The Games Collector brings Ian Livingstone’s ‘City of Thieves’ Fighting Fantasy book vividly to life in this sumptuously presented limited edition hardback. Experience the adventure as it leaps off the page, thanks to the hand-crafted interactive features in this special edition of a gamebook classic.
This limited hardback edition of ‘City of Thieves’ from The Games Collector will become a treasured and much sought-after addition to the world of Fighting Fantasy. It adds a new dimension to the Fighting Fantasy experience with the inclusion of interactive cardboard components. Decide your next action by opening envelopes or lifting flaps to uncover jewels, gold and other treasures needed to complete the adventure and defeat the villainous Zanbar Bone.

What is this new Limited Edition?
The original ‘City of Thieves’ gamebook was published in 1983 as a standard paperback with black & white interior illustrations. This new limited never-to-be-repeated edition from The Games Collector is presented in a larger, hardback format for the first time, and is full-colour, featuring entirely new illustrations. Also, for the first time in a Fighting Fantasy book, it includes physical envelopes and flaps to open, revealing the items, maps and letters you need to discover as you explore Port Blacksand. This offering comes with the full endorsement of Ian Livingstone.
Bound and printed to the highest quality by a long-established and highly reputable UK firm, each Games Collector Edition book is hand-crafted (excluding the Hero edition). The pages are hand-stitched together rather than glued, allowing the opened book to lie flat without needing to be held. The additional items are individually fixed to the inside pages.
The prototype for this edition was created and illustrated by the Brazilian artist and designer Daielyn Cris Bertelli. Using her design for this limited edition, City of Thieves has never looked so good, and is available in two languages - English and Portuguese.
Please select the correct language version when pledging.
 
What is Fighting Fantasy?
Created by Ian Livingstone & Steve Jackson, the Fighting Fantasy series of adventure gamebooks debuted in 1982 and has sold over 18 million copies worldwide. What started with ‘The Warlock of Firetop Mountain’ eventually spawned over 60 gamebooks, as well as board games and video games. As the 35th anniversary of Fighting Fantasy approaches, the legacy continues. This collector’s edition of City of Thieves is being published as part of a year-long celebration of the series which includes a brand new gamebook written by Ian Livingstone.
Fighting Fantasy gamebooks are exactly that – part game and part book. These are books in which YOU, the reader, are the Hero. Armed with a pencil and dice, YOU choose which paths to follow, which items to take, and which creatures to battle! However - as in real life - sometimes fate will decide for you. Read a passage from the story and then decide whether to turn left or right, talk to that little old man or fight him. Test you LUCK to see if you can steal the pouch from around the sleeping pirate's neck - or will he wake up? Do you have the STAMINA to fight the Serpent Queen? Do you have the SKILL needed to hit an assassin with your throwing knife? Will you survive?


 

City of Thieves
‘City of Thieves’ is one of the most popular Fighting Fantasy books ever published, and is considered a classic. Written by Ian Livingstone, it was the fifth book in the series and originally published in 1983. YOU can now experience City of Thieves, and visit the notorious Port Blacksand with this high-quality limited edition hardback from The Games Collector.
Terror stalks the night as Zanbar Bone and his bloodthirsty Moon Dogs hold the prosperous town of Silverton to ransom. YOU are an adventurer, and the merchants of Silverton turn to you in their hour of need. Your mission takes you along the dark, twisting streets of Port Blacksand where thieves, vagabonds and creatures of the night lie in wait. And beyond lies the most fearsome adventure of all – the tower stronghold of the infamous Zanbar Bone!

The Hero edition features a printed hardback cover with the iconic Iain McCaig cover artwork of course, glued rather than hand-stitched pages as per the other editions, but more importantly still containing the all-important collector’s edition 'new art elements' for fans of Fighting Fantasy.

It was written by a French merchant three hundred years earlier. Though it was short I was instantly drawn into its powerful drama. It was accompanied by his wife’s account and related their plight during the oppression of French Protestants known as Huguenots who were persecuted, imprisoned and executed unless they gave up their faith. But the merchant refused, and so did his wife. Their persecution by the French King, Louis XIV, led to an exodus and the world’s first 'refugees'. It also triggered a European war which spread to the New World where many Huguenots found refuge. It was such a remarkable story that I decided that one day, after many years of research; I would turn those memoirs into a novel, and then a trilogy. They became Jeanne and Jacob Delpech.</p><p>This campaign is all about raising the funds to finish book 2, <strong>Voyage of Malice</strong>, to get it into your hands. The manuscript is finished, I just need to get it properly edited and proofread. Then I need to finance the interior and exterior designs of the eBook and paperback.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495147899/irozhk4glhu53awac6jo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>  </p><p>I was living in Montauban where the story begins, and was able to do all the research I needed, given that the town centre hadn't changed much in three hundred years. Nevertheless, my work as a scriptwriter took up most of my time and though I had written up the broad lines of the plan, it wasn't until 20 years later that I decided to knuckle down and write the first novel. I had consequently been carrying around the story of Jacob and Jeanne with me all those years which enabled it to mature, and also gave me a good pretext to holiday in the various locations where the book takes place. I visited all the locations in <i>Merchants of Virtue</i>, how cool is that? During my travels I was also able to speak to all kinds of amazing and knowledgeable people from local historians, museum directors to the Huguenot secretary of the consistory of Geneva. And though this is a work of fiction, I have paid particular attention to keep the details historically correct. <i>Merchants of Virtue</i> was published last Christmas as an eBook and has been in print since late April.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495152484/eo4ayovfuwejphossgiz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Now that this first book is released and picking up rave reviews the time has come to publish the second book. <strong>Voyage of Malice</strong> takes us through the streets of Geneva to the straits of the Caribbean. It's the continuing story of Jeanne Delpech who resorts to spinning yarn and weaving for her livelihood, and of her husband who is sent to an island prison from which he escapes only to end up on a buccaneer ship.</p><p><strong>Voyage of Malice</strong> is already written but still needs editing and proofreading. It will be published both as an eBook and as a paperback so the book's interior and exterior need to be designed as well.</p><p>The late 17th century was a time of change both in Europe and the New World—and the Huguenots were at the very the heart of that change which ignited wars between world powers. Those who managed to flee persecution took with them their technical expertise as merchants, silk weavers, clock makers, doctors and lawyers to Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, England and the Americas where they found refuge.

It was written by a French merchant three hundred years earlier. Though it was short I was instantly drawn into its powerful drama. It was accompanied by his wife’s account and related their plight during the oppression of French Protestants known as Huguenots who were persecuted, imprisoned and executed unless they gave up their faith. But the merchant refused, and so did his wife. Their persecution by the French King, Louis XIV, led to an exodus and the world’s first 'refugees'. It also triggered a European war which spread to the New World where many Huguenots found refuge. It was such a remarkable story that I decided that one day, after many years of research; I would turn those memoirs into a novel, and then a trilogy. They became Jeanne and Jacob Delpech.This campaign is all about raising the funds to finish book 2, Voyage of Malice, to get it into your hands. The manuscript is finished, I just need to get it properly edited and proofread. Then I need to finance the interior and exterior designs of the eBook and paperback.  I was living in Montauban where the story begins, and was able to do all the research I needed, given that the town centre hadn't changed much in three hundred years. Nevertheless, my work as a scriptwriter took up most of my time and though I had written up the broad lines of the plan, it wasn't until 20 years later that I decided to knuckle down and write the first novel. I had consequently been carrying around the story of Jacob and Jeanne with me all those years which enabled it to mature, and also gave me a good pretext to holiday in the various locations where the book takes place. I visited all the locations in Merchants of Virtue, how cool is that? During my travels I was also able to speak to all kinds of amazing and knowledgeable people from local historians, museum directors to the Huguenot secretary of the consistory of Geneva. And though this is a work of fiction, I have paid particular attention to keep the details historically correct. Merchants of Virtue was published last Christmas as an eBook and has been in print since late April.Now that this first book is released and picking up rave reviews the time has come to publish the second book. Voyage of Malice takes us through the streets of Geneva to the straits of the Caribbean. It's the continuing story of Jeanne Delpech who resorts to spinning yarn and weaving for her livelihood, and of her husband who is sent to an island prison from which he escapes only to end up on a buccaneer ship.Voyage of Malice is already written but still needs editing and proofreading. It will be published both as an eBook and as a paperback so the book's interior and exterior need to be designed as well.The late 17th century was a time of change both in Europe and the New World—and the Huguenots were at the very the heart of that change which ignited wars between world powers. Those who managed to flee persecution took with them their technical expertise as merchants, silk weavers, clock makers, doctors and lawyers to Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, England and the Americas where they found refuge. These were the world's first 'refugees'.Even today their heritage and notion of tolerance has brought us great men and women in many fields from President Roosevelt to Judy Garland and from Sir Laurence Olivier to Keith Richards. But most of all this is a story about the destiny of a family who strive to keep their faith in adversity and against all the odds—in a world where religion was hijacked by men of power.The late seventeenth century has often been neglected by historians and writers of fiction, and the plight of the Huguenots has been pushed to one side for the pomp and glory of Louis XIV, the king who persecuted them. That being said, I want this book to be as entertaining as it is informative in a way that will keep readers on the edge of their seats, and keep the spirit of the world's first refugees alive. By helping me get this book to market now, you'll be part of their story, and help let their memory live on.I’m Paul Monk, an award-winning author, scriptwriter and playwright.

Nunca leerás un libro sobre relaciones que te empuje tanto a ser mejor persona con aquellos a los que amas”.</p><p> </p><p>--A.V.

Una relación poliamorosa es una relación romántica que implica a más de dos personas.</p><p><b>¿O sea, como los <i>swingers</i>?</b></p><p>No exactamente. Los <i>swingers</i> tienen un enfoque distinto: se centran en el sexo casual, aunque también pueden entablar amistades y formar vínculos más profundos. En cambio, el poliamor se centra en las relaciones profundas, aunque a menudo el sexo también es divertido.</p><p><b>Ya lo pillo: tienes una querida.</b></p><p>No, eso también es diferente. El término técnico para eso es ""infidelidad"".</p><p><b>Lo mismo me da, que me da lo mismo.</b></p><p>No. Lo que define a una relación poliamorosa es que todas las personas implicadas conocen la existencia del resto de participantes en la relación y están de acuerdo con ello.</p><p>Si estás casado y tienes una novia sin que tu mujer lo sepa, o si tu mujer lo sospecha pero no está segura, o si tu mujer lo sabe pero no le gusta, no eres poliamoroso, eres infiel. De la misma manera, si estás tirándote al fontanero mientras tu marido está fuera de la ciudad, no eres poliamorosa, eres infiel.</p><p>Lo que define al poliamor es el consentimiento informado de todas las personas involucradas. Sin él, no es poliamor. Si no puedes invitar a tu amante a la cena de Navidad con el resto de tu familia porque no quieres que nadie sepa lo que estás haciendo, probablemente no es poliamor.</p><p>Puedes encontrar más en <a href=""http://externos.poliamormadrid.org/posts/preguntas-frecuentes-poliamor-I.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Poliamor Madrid.</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p style=""clear: both;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430704991/znhylwuszgtizlbgeszj.png"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;width: 358.086px;height: 83px;background-color: initial;""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Cuando Franklin y Eve publicaron <i>More Than Two</i> en 2014, crearon la editorial independiente Thorntree Press en Portland (Oregón, EE.

Estamos tremendamente agradecidos por tu apoyo.Desafortunadamente, como quizás ya sepas, la campaña no ha conseguido alcanzar la meta propuesta. De hecho, se quedó a bastante distancia, por lo que la cantidad recaudada no nos hubiera permitido publicar el libro. Por ello, dado que no habríamos podido cumplir con las recompensas prometidas, Indiegogo ya ha devuelto vuestras aportaciones.Aún seguimos queriendo que este proyecto salga adelante y estamos buscando maneras de conseguirlo. En cuanto hayamos decidido el camino a seguir, nos pondremos en contacto contigo para informarte de cómo puedes apoyar la traducción y disfrutar del libro en español por adelantado.Una vez más, gracias por creer en este proyecto.Update 16 June 2016 We want to thank you with all our hearts for supporting the campaign to translate More Than Two: A Practical Guide to Ethical Polyamory into Spanish. We are tremendously grateful for your support. Unfortunately, as you probably know by now, the campaign did not reach its goal. In fact, it fell far short. The amount we were able to raise would not have even come close to allowing us to publish the book—and so, since we wouldn’t be able to meet our promises to you, Indiegogo has refunded your contributions.We still want to see this project happen, and we’re looking at ways now to do that. We’ll be in touch once we’ve decided on our way forward, with information on how you can support the translation and get early access to the book in Spanish.Thank you again for believing in this project.La práctica del poliamor El poliamor consiste en amar a más de una persona de forma consensuada, responsable y ética, con el conocimiento de todas las personas implicadas. Conlleva un vínculo emocional, por lo que no es comparable con el intercambio de parejas o swinging. El poliamor requiere confianza, integridad, comunicación y valor.El libro More Than Two se publicó en el año 2014 y pronto se convirtió en un referente del poliamor, ya que se centra en exclusiva en este tipo de relaciones y ofrece multitud de casos prácticos y consejos útiles para su buen funcionamiento.El objetivo de esta campaña es traducir y editar el libro en español, ya que no existe ninguna referencia escrita en nuestro idioma que trate el tema de manera tan amplia. Basado en décadas de experiencia en relaciones poliamorosas, More Than Two ofrece las herramientas necesarias para el autoconocimiento, la toma de decisiones íntegras y éticas y la mejora de la comunicación en las relaciones personales, sean del tipo que sean. ¿Quiénes somos? Somos un grupo de activistas de poliamor en España quienes apoyamos esta campaña con el objetivo de disponer de esta guía que consideramos básica y necesaria para la comunidad, así como para cualquier persona que quiera mantener relaciones éticas, responsables y felices. Estamos colaborando con Franklin Veaux y Eve Rickert para conseguir, a través del crowfunding, traducir y editar el libro en nuestro idioma, ya que existen muy pocos recursos escritos en español, y consideramos que las experiencias y consejos que nos ofrecen son de gran valor para el buen desarrollo de las relaciones poliamorosas.Franklin Veaux es un escritor y activista poliamoroso cuya web y blog acerca del poliamor han sido un valioso recurso para la comunidad desde hace cerca de 20 años. Esta web es una de las más visitadas sobre el tema, aparece en segundo lugar al buscar en Google la palabra “polyamory” y recibe miles de emails de lectores agradecidos. Eve Rickert es escritora y editora profesional. En relaciones poliamorosas desde hace más de diez años, es activista y fundadora de varios movimientos poliamorosos en Canadá. Karen Moan es periodista y autora del libro The Moan Club, una novela basada en una historia de poliamor. Realiza su labor como activista en la Asociación poliamor Madrid desde su fundación hace dos años.Nuestro equipo de producción está repartido por el Mediterráneo y lo conforman E., Begoña y Yeray. E. cuenta con la experiencia en traducción necesaria para asegurar que nuestro mensaje llegue perfectamente. Begoña, como correctora con diez años de experiencia en el sector de la traducción, irá a la caza y captura de faltas de ortografía y frases de gramática poco elegante. Por último Yeray, como maquetador, se encargará de dar al libro ese aspecto bonito y agradable que tanto invita a leer. Los tres, como profesionales de estas tareas, cuentan con sobrada experiencia y pasión por el proyecto para crear un libro fantástico. ¿Cómo funciona el crowdfunding? ¿En qué consiste una campaña de crowdfunding? A través de la misma se comparte la financiación de un proyecto entre las personas que desean apoyarlo. En el caso de este libro, la totalidad de lo recaudado se destinará a la traducción, revisión y corrección (40%), impresión y envío de recompensas (50%), publicidad y producción (5%) y diseño (5%). Cada aportación, por pequeña que sea, ¡cuenta!, ya que muestra el interés colectivo por conseguir el objetivo de la campaña. Sin tu ayuda, no es posible. ¡Colabora! ¡Échale un vistazo al índice! Prólogo de Janet W.

  “Este libro también puede ser útil para parejas que se identifiquen como monógamas, ya que para ellas podría ser beneficioso hablar por primera vez o volver a plantear las dinámicas de poder y las reglas que forman parte de sus relaciones”. --Melissa K. Bergdall y Marie L.C. Blumer, Journal of Feminist Family Therapy “Si quieres crear relaciones sólidas, en las que tus parejas se sientan cuidadas, seguras y capaces de abogar por sus necesidades, te recomiendo que leas este libro. Incluso animaría a las personas monógamas a leerlo, por las herramientas y guías que proporciona. Confía en mí. Nunca leerás un libro sobre relaciones que te empuje tanto a ser mejor persona con aquellos a los que amas”. --A.V. Flox  Preguntas frecuentes sobre poliamor de Franklin Veaux  Estas son algunas de las respuestas de Franklin publicadas en su web.Entonces, ¿qué significa ""poliamor""?El término ""poliamor"" viene del latín y el griego y significa ""muchos amores"" (literalmente, poly [""muchos""] y amor [""amor""]). Una relación poliamorosa es una relación romántica que implica a más de dos personas.¿O sea, como los swingers?No exactamente. Los swingers tienen un enfoque distinto: se centran en el sexo casual, aunque también pueden entablar amistades y formar vínculos más profundos. En cambio, el poliamor se centra en las relaciones profundas, aunque a menudo el sexo también es divertido.Ya lo pillo: tienes una querida.No, eso también es diferente. El término técnico para eso es ""infidelidad"".Lo mismo me da, que me da lo mismo.No. Lo que define a una relación poliamorosa es que todas las personas implicadas conocen la existencia del resto de participantes en la relación y están de acuerdo con ello.Si estás casado y tienes una novia sin que tu mujer lo sepa, o si tu mujer lo sospecha pero no está segura, o si tu mujer lo sabe pero no le gusta, no eres poliamoroso, eres infiel. De la misma manera, si estás tirándote al fontanero mientras tu marido está fuera de la ciudad, no eres poliamorosa, eres infiel.Lo que define al poliamor es el consentimiento informado de todas las personas involucradas. Sin él, no es poliamor. Si no puedes invitar a tu amante a la cena de Navidad con el resto de tu familia porque no quieres que nadie sepa lo que estás haciendo, probablemente no es poliamor.Puedes encontrar más en Poliamor Madrid.    Cuando Franklin y Eve publicaron More Than Two en 2014, crearon la editorial independiente Thorntree Press en Portland (Oregón, EE. UU.). Se especializa en libros de no ficción sobre relaciones personales, amor y sexualidad, particularmente en modelos de relación no convencionales. Sus libros aportan un enfoque racional y basado en evidencias y comparten historias de la vida real.Thorntree Press financia la producción y el marketing de todos sus libros mediante crowdfunding. Esto les permite mantener un nivel de calidad alto, arriesgar a la hora de seleccionar los títulos y hacer llegar a los creadores un porcentaje mayor en calidad de derechos de autor. Hasta la fecha han finalizado con éxito cuatro campañas de crowdfunding: la edición original de More Than Two en inglés, la lista de títulos para el 2015 (que incluye The Game Changer, el libro de memorias de Franklin), Ask Me About Polyamory: The Best of Kimchi Cuddles y Purple Prose: Bisexuality in Britain, con cientos de mecenas satisfechos.Thorntree Press administrará las contribuciones a este crowdfunding y destinará los fondos a la traducción, revisión, maquetación, corrección, producción y costes de marketing. El destino de los fondos recaudados es el siguiente:    Las recompensas  Además de la edición impresa y digital de More Than Two en español (Más de dos) ofreceremos un amplio catálogo de recompensas de la editorial Thorntree Press, de sus autores y de otros creadores. Pegatinas de Ama más, sé genial.

Not wanting to disappoint our canine readers, we finally decided to do re-launch the original edition but this time with more dogs. Featuring 64 pages of hard-hitting stories, interviews with famous pups, horoscopes, a crossword puzzle that will challenge even the smartest hound, dating advice, and fashion from our team of daring doggie reporters, Good Hooman is the first magazine in which stories are told from the dog's point of view.In one enlightening exposé, Dr. Helmut Paws, resident professor of Hooman Studies, asks once and for all, “Do hoomans really want the ball?”We tackle the tough issues and take a lesson on how to survive vacuuming day alongside survival and tactical barking expert Chuck Gnawriss.Our intrepid reporter, Peanut, goes undercover and under the couch to discover what really happens when hoomans gather for their nights of strange behavior and synchronized howling, in the world exclusive,‘Secrets of Hooman Pack Night. The magazine also features:Fashion: What’s moving, shaking, and panting in the world of doggie fashion. In this edition, “Jackets, Sweaters and Snoods: Are They Really Good for Work and Walkies?Food: Get the latest tail-wagging recipes for the culinary canine and then devour them mercilessly.History: We delve into the previously untold story of the dachshunds and set the record straight about wieners through the ages.Heart-warming stories: We meet the unsung heroes – dogs who have survived against the odds, saved lives, and provided comfort to sick and elderly hoomans.Travel: We explore what’s hot in the world of poochy travel and then check in for a weekend at the Sausage Dog Hotel.You’ll find these stories and more, only in Good Hooman Magazine. You can even choose your own cover dog, something completely unique to any poochy publication.World famous Crusoe the Celebrity Dachshund is just one of our cover dogs.

<p>To be honest I’ve got sick of trying to find ways to advertise my site. Yes you can use social media but that doesn’t help as your comments or your posts get buried under new posts, so I’m creating my own website which I can advertise my site and I would like to share this with others who feel like me. I haven’t got hundreds off pounds to spend on advertising and trying to create back links and so on... So I’m going to be designing a website where anyone can add there page, group, online store,YouTube channel, Facebook page and many more from as little as £1!</p>
<p>Some of the features on the site are:</p>
<p>A grid can be setup to allow users to change their pixel image, text, URL and email address on their own via a user login account.</p>
<p>Unlimited traffic to the website in turn people can click on your pixel advert and be directed straight to your URL/site.</p>
<p>Once you have bought your pixels their is no renewing them, costing more money, subscriptions to pay, there yours, just a one off payment for a advert for years!</p>
<p>You can edit them, change your logo, email address and URL fully editable</p>
<p>What can I share?</p>
<p>People like to make youtube videos about their life or a product or show off there gaming skills with this website you can advertise to the world what your all about, you can link the pixels to your Favourite video, story or your facebook page, you can edit the URL on your account and change the picture/image to your desire</p>
<p>You can share your Business, your blogs you can share anything you want and you can edit this at any time!</p>
<p>What have I put into this?</p>
<p> I have bought the Domain name, web hosting space and already set up accounts on Social Media, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and more to help promote this. My objective is to email companies/Business as well as general people who just want to get their site/channel known.</p>

<h3>What's Alban Lake Publishing?</h3>
<p>An excellent question! Alban Lake Publishing is an independent book publisher. We work directly with authors to help them make their dreams a reality to to get them out in the world. We try to be a faithful publisher to those who want to stay with us, and a great first step for those who want to break into the world of writing. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do an Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>To be honest, we want to take our business to the next level. Alban Lake has been around for nearly 11 years, but the past 3 years has seen it pass to a new generation and seen it take off. Now we need a boost to get us really out there and known in the world with advertising, new equipment, and more. We're essentially a new start up at this point, having brought the company to that point, and we need that starting income to really make it work. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How your contribution helps. </h3>
<p>Your contributions will go to help make us bigger. Currently we're a small handful of editors (only around 7) and we're doing novels, novellas, several magazines, and anthologies. We want to help more, but without more people we can't. We need more editors and extra funds to publish more and advertise more to really get things going. We're on the cusp, our books now being bought by Barnes &amp; Noble among others, but we can't put up a billboard or even really spread it with Facebook advertising and without that extra knowledge and push, we can't help our authors and editors much at all. <br/><br/>To put it simply, since we as a business have no credit, your backing will ensure that we can get new computers for our editors that need them, secure extra book printings per month, help to get at least one of our magazines pro-rated for better selling and better pay for authors, and help get us advertising so we can put our name out there as a publisher that can help you break into the writing world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Special Rewards</h3>
<p>We're always working hard to improve what we put out and we now have digital books as well as new books coming out all the time. You can get signed copies of books, a subscription that will grant you access to all our digital content for a full year, book plates, special books, book boxes, and more. You could even have your name in a book or magazine as a contributor for helping us. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hey, don't worry if you can't contribute directly. We understand very well that not everyone has cash at the ready. That doesn't mean you can't help spread the word about the campaign! Share it on Twitter, Facebook, wherever you feel it's appropriate and let the world know that Alban Lake wants to jump to the next level and help more dreams come true!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>My name is Twyla, I am 13 years old and I dream of becoming a Veterinarian, my love for helping and protecting animals gave me the idea to write about what I love.  I wrote this book to encourage kids to read, create and imagine.  The Book is titled: Glitter Girl, its's about  about a girl that dreams of becoming a superhero that saves animals from all of the evil in the world.  It all started when a girl named Sheree was sitting on her porch with her mom reading a book about Superheroes and she wondered what it would be like  to save animals and the  world....  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The next day  Sheree was walking and talking with her friends and she  tells them  that she dreams of becoming a superhero just like Wonder Woman. Her friends laugh and walked away. Sheree was walking home one day after hanging with her friends, and suddenly Glitter fell from the sky and sprinkled all over her and she got a weird tingly feeling and out of nowhere Glitter started shooting out of her hands,  Then Sheree ran way in shock, and Glitter Girl was a reality!! </strong></p>
<p><strong>I worked so hard writing this project because I want kids all over to know that you can be anything you want to be, So DREAM BIG!!  This is my first book, and I believe it can change lives.

I want to self publish so I will have all rights and ownership. I eventually want to create merchandise for the characters of my book. After the book is published I want to travel to my hometown to promote the book and other cities. Your donations will help with all of this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I want to encourage kids to read again. I love to read and I believe reading help kids become creative. Please help me with my dream? I work really hard in school, and I wrote this book between school, cheerleading and homework. One day I want to create a cartoon for my book characters. I'm already starting on a 2nd book .

Do you have any resources?”This wasn’t the first time a parent would ask me this question . . . and it won’t be the last.I’m Contessa Louise Cooper. A writer, speaker, advocate and an autism mom. I’ve been outspoken about my struggles as a single parent, raising a child with autism without many resources, governmental or otherwise. Those experiences can be found in my first book, “Mad At The World: How To Move On And Find Peace When You’re A Special Needs Parent”. I’ve watched my son grow from a child to a man. However, I realize that I’ve done him a disservice. I haven’t prepared him to deal with things like raging hormones, dating, marriage and intimacy. In my quest to protect him from the “evils of the world,” I kept him a kid in my mind and OVERPROTECTED him. Unfortunately, I’m not the only parent who has done this. I’m here to correct my mistake and help others do the same. It’s better late than never, right? What is Autism, Sex & Dating all about?Autism, Sex & Dating is written for individuals with high-level functioning autism to help them navigate the modern world of dating and sex. Think of it more as of a guide or handbook to read over and over again to help them feel more confident, and answer their most private questions. Some of the things we will discuss are:
Self-Identity
Self-Worth
Dating
Sex
Living Together
 I am working to compose a “true outline,” as I’m interviewing adults and young adults, parents and experts. This book is for everyone. I create spaces that are inclusive of everyone because culture, sexual identity, spirituality all matter when you are dating. I’m also working on a glossary of term and video to model words, such as “flirting”. What does all this have to do with me?Do you remember dating?

<h3>Deity? What's that? Why should I read it?</h3>
<p>   Deity is a novel based around your good ol' fashioned fantasy quest. Set in a forbidden, abandoned country, our main character seeks and finds the fabled quest set by the old king.

<li>I've also written this book with a basic structure which is easy to keep track of - with each chapter comes a new foe and a new battle to fight, very much like a video game.</li>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why I Don't Like Caves</strong></p>
<p>It was my decision to leave.</p>
<p>For splendour, for treasure, for fun? Who knew? I didn’t. I had no pigging idea. But when you’re four days out from the nearest town and one day up the tallest mountain you could find, that’s when sanity is ready to be questioned.</p>
<p>And trust me, I’d questioned it many times, but riding horseback on a cliff-edge with a dead dog on my lap… this was the lowest of the low. Further than low, somewhere far, far lower than low. I couldn’t get much lower.</p>
<p>I kept telling myself: Ginny won’t be dead much longer. I’ll find the quest. I’ll resurrect her. I’ll do it. But really? A quest for the power of resurrection… in this day and age, that all sounded very much fake. If only I’d thought like this a week ago.</p>
<p>Mountains, sparse greenery and thick fog had awed me at first, scared me, but now I was bored, as if a record of my favourite song had been set to play on repeat for weeks on end. Rocks. Just rocks. Rocks and grey, steel sky. You couldn’t exactly play ‘I spy’ when there were only three answers tops, especially when the only person to play it with was a horse. My bum was sore, my fingers felt numb… it was alright for Opuh with her thick mane and fur coat. To be honest that was probably my fault for not packing the right clothes, but packing gloves and a woolly hat didn’t exactly fit in the picture when Rinku had been describing a land of diamond birds and ‘flowers as big as your head’.</p>
<p>I was kind of glad he hadn’t come with me now. Him with that skinny little body of his wouldn’t have made it three days on the mountains without wasting away to nothing. At first I’d been begging for him to come but now… well let’s just say this mountain path wasn’t exactly wide enough for two horses. It was high, too. He was scared of heights.</p>
<p>I wiped snot from my runny nose, sniffing and rubbing my freezing hands together. I hadn’t been expecting a relaxing holiday in the sun but this was a little of an extreme contrast. At least the cold kept me awake. Falling off Opuh here wouldn’t be very pretty.</p>
<p>A jittering snort caught my attention. That shivering hand on her shoulder, I leant forward to see what was wrong - she gestured with her muzzle and I followed her gaze. I couldn’t have been any happier.</p>
<p>A cave! We were heading straight for a gloomy, deep, dark cave. We could get out of the cold, out of the bitter wind and actually rest for a while without the scare of deadly drops. Finally!</p>
<p>We plodded through the wide mouth, feeling the wind drop, the metallic sound of horseshoes hitting the stone floor echoing and pushing the last remnants of light back. It was dark in here… I unzipped my bag, pulled out my handset and held the small sphere tight in a fist. I always loved playing with the torch on this. Best birthday present ever. Instead of the average slab of a phone, this baby’s screen were eye contacts. Eye contacts. How cool is that?! I squeezed the ball and the day’s date filled my eyes. I didn’t need reminding how long I’d been gone, so I twisted the ball right once, twice, then blinked. When I opened them… light! My eyes were the torch! I still had to get used to how awesome this was. They were like the headlights of a car and I was the car! Okay stop, stop, matter at hand.</p>
<p>I looked up. Rocks. Left. Rocks. Right- Oh hello.</p>
<p>Dismounting, balancing Ginny on the saddle, I hopped to the wall. That definitely wasn’t a rock. It was like a hologram? Round, red, glowing not quite as bright as my eyes, just big enough to fit my hand through… Should I? I looked around at Opuh, who was staring at me expectantly. Okay then.</p>
<p>It turned green, and a warm beam grazed my knuckles. I could only allude it to the scanners at school. It was a pleasant sensation for a bit, tickly. It buzzed, flooded the cave in a bright, acidic green.</p>
<p>Opuh yelped and my stomach flipped as the ground seemed to be whipped from under us. Whoops.</p>
<p>For a second I was plummeting through the dark void, eyes wide open yet feeling tightly shut until my knees hit hard rock and forehead bounced painfully off the ground. Ow. My head span, playing tricks on me, for a moment knocking a sense of where I was from my memory. Slowly, I struggled to sit back on my heels and the loose fragments of information found their way back into the right slots of my brain. That had hurt. It was dark, my torch had cut out, I could have sworn my leg was bleeding and <i>gods</i> this place stank. The sphere was gone. My heart leapt. That… would cost a lot to replace.</p>
<p>Where was I? Where was Opuh? Where was <i>Ginny</i>?</p>

Why I Don't Like Caves
It was my decision to leave.
For splendour, for treasure, for fun? Who knew? I didn’t. I had no pigging idea. But when you’re four days out from the nearest town and one day up the tallest mountain you could find, that’s when sanity is ready to be questioned.
And trust me, I’d questioned it many times, but riding horseback on a cliff-edge with a dead dog on my lap… this was the lowest of the low. Further than low, somewhere far, far lower than low. I couldn’t get much lower.
I kept telling myself: Ginny won’t be dead much longer. I’ll find the quest. I’ll resurrect her. I’ll do it. But really? A quest for the power of resurrection… in this day and age, that all sounded very much fake. If only I’d thought like this a week ago.
Mountains, sparse greenery and thick fog had awed me at first, scared me, but now I was bored, as if a record of my favourite song had been set to play on repeat for weeks on end. Rocks. Just rocks. Rocks and grey, steel sky. You couldn’t exactly play ‘I spy’ when there were only three answers tops, especially when the only person to play it with was a horse. My bum was sore, my fingers felt numb… it was alright for Opuh with her thick mane and fur coat. To be honest that was probably my fault for not packing the right clothes, but packing gloves and a woolly hat didn’t exactly fit in the picture when Rinku had been describing a land of diamond birds and ‘flowers as big as your head’.
I was kind of glad he hadn’t come with me now. Him with that skinny little body of his wouldn’t have made it three days on the mountains without wasting away to nothing. At first I’d been begging for him to come but now… well let’s just say this mountain path wasn’t exactly wide enough for two horses. It was high, too. He was scared of heights.
I wiped snot from my runny nose, sniffing and rubbing my freezing hands together. I hadn’t been expecting a relaxing holiday in the sun but this was a little of an extreme contrast. At least the cold kept me awake. Falling off Opuh here wouldn’t be very pretty.
A jittering snort caught my attention. That shivering hand on her shoulder, I leant forward to see what was wrong - she gestured with her muzzle and I followed her gaze. I couldn’t have been any happier.
A cave! We were heading straight for a gloomy, deep, dark cave. We could get out of the cold, out of the bitter wind and actually rest for a while without the scare of deadly drops. Finally!
We plodded through the wide mouth, feeling the wind drop, the metallic sound of horseshoes hitting the stone floor echoing and pushing the last remnants of light back. It was dark in here… I unzipped my bag, pulled out my handset and held the small sphere tight in a fist. I always loved playing with the torch on this. Best birthday present ever. Instead of the average slab of a phone, this baby’s screen were eye contacts. Eye contacts. How cool is that?! I squeezed the ball and the day’s date filled my eyes. I didn’t need reminding how long I’d been gone, so I twisted the ball right once, twice, then blinked. When I opened them… light! My eyes were the torch! I still had to get used to how awesome this was. They were like the headlights of a car and I was the car! Okay stop, stop, matter at hand.
I looked up. Rocks. Left. Rocks. Right- Oh hello.
Dismounting, balancing Ginny on the saddle, I hopped to the wall. That definitely wasn’t a rock. It was like a hologram? Round, red, glowing not quite as bright as my eyes, just big enough to fit my hand through… Should I? I looked around at Opuh, who was staring at me expectantly. Okay then.
It turned green, and a warm beam grazed my knuckles. I could only allude it to the scanners at school. It was a pleasant sensation for a bit, tickly. It buzzed, flooded the cave in a bright, acidic green.
Opuh yelped and my stomach flipped as the ground seemed to be whipped from under us. Whoops.
For a second I was plummeting through the dark void, eyes wide open yet feeling tightly shut until my knees hit hard rock and forehead bounced painfully off the ground. Ow. My head span, playing tricks on me, for a moment knocking a sense of where I was from my memory. Slowly, I struggled to sit back on my heels and the loose fragments of information found their way back into the right slots of my brain. That had hurt. It was dark, my torch had cut out, I could have sworn my leg was bleeding and gods this place stank. The sphere was gone. My heart leapt. That… would cost a lot to replace.
Where was I? Where was Opuh? Where was Ginny?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We suffer when we lose someone, or they get <a href=""https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alzeheimers</a>, a <a href=""https://www.emedicinehealth.com/head_injury/article_em.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">head injury</a> or we just have forgotten <a href=""https://lifehacker.com/5965703/the-science-of-storytelling-why-telling-a-story-is-the-most-powerful-way-to-activate-our-brains"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the terrific stories </a>of our children, our growth &amp; development or our travels and journeys. <a href=""http://www.bethlord.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Write Heart Memories® </a>is a storytelling journey that transforms your spoken words into a personal storybook that ignites your memory and the reader with your self-expression and unique living legacy.</p>
<p>Comfort and trust are what helps someone open up to storytelling and the feelings and emotions around that story that makes a great story, so I build this foundation until that person is ready to record their story with me. First, I email or send a welcome kit to every individual that includes a welcome postcard, a pamphlet of why their stories are important, two books I've written about how to get at your great stories and questions for the individual to fill out and 3 brief movies showing how important our stories are to ourselves and each other. I exchange emails and phone calls until the individual knows me as a dear friend. </p>
<p>I spend 120 minutes with each person, and that can be broken down into whatever time frame the person is comfortable in scheduling. This journey works on the telephone, Skype, Zoom or in-person. When I listen to someone talking, I don't have anything else going on in my mind. There is no mind chatter. My mind is calm, and my heart is open.  </p>
<p>Everyone has at least one great story to tell, and I am passionate about giving people a chance to do this. I keep costs reasonable so people can do this. This campaign is crucial to me, and it matters that I have your support in growing this company. The first step is an assistant to help me so I can focus on transforming storytelling into a handcrafted personal book. And then hiring more people and training people to write heart memory practitioners. I see global storytelling villages and people being able to tell their stories to trusted individuals getting these books for themselves and their loved ones. You can see a little bit of my building community and where I'm going with this when you go to <a href=""https://www.bethlord.com/community/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my community page</a>.  I only put their first name unless specified, so some level is confidential but most important, people can benefit from this person's life. Stories connect us to each other.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, a place online where you know that you can go to find a book that you are interested in because of the cover, the description or you want to read that person's story. You pay .99 cents (this money will go towards website upkeep and strengthening our global storytelling villages), download the book and read it.  Now, we are using each other and appreciating our life experiences to help us grow, learn, heal, laugh, feel compassion, be inspired, motivated and gain insights. Our stories connect us to one another, and I want Write Heart Memories® to be that place where people know they can go to tell their stories or read a great book about someone else's story. If you will, it's like sitting around the campfire and telling stories to each other, but it's at your free will. Where's the campfire? It's in the books that ignite us to the call-to-action we are feeling at the time we download the book. </p>
<p>This campaign calls up my most profound sense of responsibility, honor, and integrity. Please help me strengthen this vision for storytelling and expand this storytelling that connects us to each other and our legacies.</p>
<p>Writing and interviewing people for their stories has always been my passion. I'm a good listener, and people sense my non-judgment as they tell me their secrets with confidence. I make people comfortable because I open their heart when they are ready. My background as an Occupational Therapist, Feldenkrais Practitioner, and Pharmaceutical Rep strengthened these abilities. I turned Professional Writer seven years ago when I knew I had to bring my dream to life. </p>
<p>I love writing peoples' stories, and I've been doing it for seven years. I am more than happy to share my first story FINDING OTIS or other stories so you can see my craft.  </p>

It failed, and my depression hit the roof. How to cope? I left three weeks later to become a pilgrim and walk <a href=""http://santiago-compostela.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Camino de Santiago</a>.  This quest was an extraordinary experience. I walked it again in 2014, 2015 and then I volunteered in 2016.  After the two weeks of volunteering, I was walking on <a href=""http://caminoways.com/ways/northern-way-camino-del-norte/northern-way-full-way"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Camino del Norte</a>, and I broke down after two days. I sat in front of the Atlantic Ocean and was quiet. The Camino spirit came to me, and she told me to go home. My Camino had been my volunteering. My sister had died that January and the Camino lovingly said, ""I can't bring her back. I am through with the Camino as I knew her. My Camino was now going home and getting my company together so I could listen to peoples' stories because that was going to be my new Camino.""</p>
<p>I have written many books, and I am more than willing to show you. Writing is time-consuming as well as transcribing, editing and formatting. I love doing these processes because it's part of the person's transformational journey in telling their stories and getting a book from these stories. The storytelling into books is nourishment for our hearts and souls. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The dangers and obstacles I face include whether or not people identify with what I'm trying to do and the value in such a personal interaction. I've made it a point to take care of myself.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>About The Book</h3>
<p><strong>Successfully funded on Kickstarter, and now on IndieGoGo In Demand! </strong></p>
<p>Playing and writing awesome Riffs is one of the <strong>most gratifying and fun things</strong> to do on Guitar. Trouble is, most Guitarists <i>don’t have a clue</i> about how great Riffs are born. Is it magic? Is it simply raw talent? Or is it something that can <strong>actually be taught</strong>?</p>
<p>Happily, it’s the latter! There are core <i>musical</i> and <i>technical</i> concepts behind great Riffing - things like expanding your ideas about Power Chords, utilizing Voice Leading, harnessing the unique sounds of Chord Extensions, injecting Rhythmic Variety, unleashing Scale Fragments &amp; Chromaticism, and <strong>a lot more</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the World of Guitar, bringing these concepts together into a <strong>holistic, practical, and practice-able format</strong> has eluded Guitar instructors and authors - to the detriment of all Guitar Students hungry for Heaviness.</p>
<p>With this new book from Metal Guitar Academy (and me - Brett Miller!), <strong>all of that is about to change</strong>. You <i>hear</i> the ideas in this book <strong>used all the time </strong>in Power Metal, Thrash, Death Metal, 80s Metal &amp; Rock, Prog Metal, Instrumental Rock -but no one ever seems to explain what you’re hearing! With <i>Riff Rampage! </i>you’ll be able to <strong>understand what’s going on</strong> in all those cool riffs...and be able to play like that <i>yourself!</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
<p>With <i>Riff Rampage!</i>, you’ll not only get a book chock-full of <strong>clear and comprehensive explanations</strong> about the <i>why </i>behind awesome riffing, you’ll also get <strong>tons of examples</strong> as well. Plus, you’ll get <strong>audio/video demonstrations</strong> of each Riff and exercise, in a YouTube playlist, so that you can hear what it’s all supposed to sound like. </p>
<p>The book is being written right now, and here are just some of the topics in store for you Shredding Skirmishers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed understanding of intervals and their usage in Riffing</li>
<li>Inversions of intervals, and how to Riff with them</li>
<li>Scales, and how they relate to Riffs</li>
<li>What “Power Chords” really are (and how to expand your usage of them)</li>
<li>Three-string Power Chords</li>
<li>Extended Harmony Power Chords</li>
<li>Diatonic Power Chord sequences</li>
<li>Extensive Power Chord “codex”, with all shapes clearly written and demonstrated in context</li>
<li>Triads &amp; Arpeggios in Riffs</li>
<li>Voice Leading for Melodic &amp; Modern-sounding Riffing</li>
<li>Scale Fragments in Riffs</li>
<li>Speed &amp; Accuracy</li>
<li>Muting techniques</li>
<li>Trem picking</li>
</ul>
<p>And a lot more! <i>Riff Rampage!</i> is truly the first book of its kind, laying out a comprehensive, top-level, practical approach to <strong>understanding, writing, and playing Riffs</strong> for Metal &amp; Rock. Guitarists of <strong>any ability level</strong>, from Beginner to Pro player, will benefit from using this book. </p>
<h3>Riff-centric Perks</h3>
<p>In addition to the book itself, I've put together some unique (and fun!) personalized Items for you to choose from. Check 'em out, and pick one that suits your style! All the Perks are cumulative, so each higher-tiered Perk includes all the Items from each previous Perk.</p>
<h3>About Metal Guitar Academy</h3>
<p>My sole aim as a Guitar Instructor is to provide <i>clear</i>, <i>concise</i>, and<i> practical</i> information in three important areas of Guitar playing: Technique / Neck Knowledge / Theory. Here at Metal Guitar Academy, I call this the <strong>T.N.T. Guitar Strategy</strong>. </p>
<p>As a pro Guitarist, author / instructor, recording artist, and video game composer, I’ve had a lot of experience with <strong>what works, and what doesn’t</strong> - both from a playing &amp; practicing standpoint, <i>and</i> from a teaching standpoint. As a private teacher to Guitarists <strong>around the world for over 15 years</strong>, I’ve become quite adept at identifying people’s playing problems, and then quickly diagnosing a solution. Over those same years, I also began to notice the glaring deficiencies in most Guitar instructional material, and as a result, began to create books and courses through Metal Guitar Academy.</p>
<p>Your progress as a player is my passion, and I’m excited to make <i>Riff Rampage!</i> the next <strong>nail in the coffin</strong> of mediocre Guitar instruction!</p>
<h3>But, Can He Walk the Walk?</h3>

<p>So listen, I'm located in New York, USA, and we all know that shipping internationally is an added cost.

</div></div>","If your Riffs were at the beach, would they get sand kicked in their face by a Heavier Riff?
If the answer is “yes”, then you need a Charles-Atlas-like program of Strength Building for your Riff playing and Riff writing. If you’re tired of being the “98 lb. weakling” of Guitar Riffers....
 


 
...then it’s time for training...it’s time for revenge...
...it's time to go on a Riff Rampage! 
 


 
About The Book
Successfully funded on Kickstarter, and now on IndieGoGo In Demand! 
Playing and writing awesome Riffs is one of the most gratifying and fun things to do on Guitar. Trouble is, most Guitarists don’t have a clue about how great Riffs are born. Is it magic? Is it simply raw talent? Or is it something that can actually be taught?
Happily, it’s the latter! There are core musical and technical concepts behind great Riffing - things like expanding your ideas about Power Chords, utilizing Voice Leading, harnessing the unique sounds of Chord Extensions, injecting Rhythmic Variety, unleashing Scale Fragments & Chromaticism, and a lot more.
Unfortunately, in the World of Guitar, bringing these concepts together into a holistic, practical, and practice-able format has eluded Guitar instructors and authors - to the detriment of all Guitar Students hungry for Heaviness.
With this new book from Metal Guitar Academy (and me - Brett Miller!), all of that is about to change. You hear the ideas in this book used all the time in Power Metal, Thrash, Death Metal, 80s Metal & Rock, Prog Metal, Instrumental Rock -but no one ever seems to explain what you’re hearing! With Riff Rampage! you’ll be able to understand what’s going on in all those cool riffs...and be able to play like that yourself!

What You'll Learn
With Riff Rampage!, you’ll not only get a book chock-full of clear and comprehensive explanations about the why behind awesome riffing, you’ll also get tons of examples as well. Plus, you’ll get audio/video demonstrations of each Riff and exercise, in a YouTube playlist, so that you can hear what it’s all supposed to sound like. 
The book is being written right now, and here are just some of the topics in store for you Shredding Skirmishers:

Detailed understanding of intervals and their usage in Riffing
Inversions of intervals, and how to Riff with them
Scales, and how they relate to Riffs
What “Power Chords” really are (and how to expand your usage of them)
Three-string Power Chords
Extended Harmony Power Chords
Diatonic Power Chord sequences
Extensive Power Chord “codex”, with all shapes clearly written and demonstrated in context
Triads & Arpeggios in Riffs
Voice Leading for Melodic & Modern-sounding Riffing
Scale Fragments in Riffs
Speed & Accuracy
Muting techniques
Trem picking

And a lot more! Riff Rampage! is truly the first book of its kind, laying out a comprehensive, top-level, practical approach to understanding, writing, and playing Riffs for Metal & Rock. Guitarists of any ability level, from Beginner to Pro player, will benefit from using this book. 
Riff-centric Perks
In addition to the book itself, I've put together some unique (and fun!) personalized Items for you to choose from. Check 'em out, and pick one that suits your style! All the Perks are cumulative, so each higher-tiered Perk includes all the Items from each previous Perk.
About Metal Guitar Academy
My sole aim as a Guitar Instructor is to provide clear, concise, and practical information in three important areas of Guitar playing: Technique / Neck Knowledge / Theory. Here at Metal Guitar Academy, I call this the T.N.T. Guitar Strategy. 
As a pro Guitarist, author / instructor, recording artist, and video game composer, I’ve had a lot of experience with what works, and what doesn’t - both from a playing & practicing standpoint, and from a teaching standpoint. As a private teacher to Guitarists around the world for over 15 years, I’ve become quite adept at identifying people’s playing problems, and then quickly diagnosing a solution. Over those same years, I also began to notice the glaring deficiencies in most Guitar instructional material, and as a result, began to create books and courses through Metal Guitar Academy.
Your progress as a player is my passion, and I’m excited to make Riff Rampage! the next nail in the coffin of mediocre Guitar instruction!
But, Can He Walk the Walk?
Talk is cheap. I’d want to make sure someone can bring the goods if I were going to get a book by them, and I’m sure you'd want to as well.
Here are some excerpts from one of my Instrumental Metal records, Oath Of Dagon, as well as a vid of some improv jamming. Feel free to check out the Metal Guitar Academy site in general (https://www.MetalGuitarAcademy.com) if you’d like to see more of what MGA is all about, or some more info about the other MGA books & courses offered as part of the Rewards.

<h3>¡HOLA!</h3>
<p>Somos la <strong>Asociacion Universitaria Bocamina </strong>de la ETSIME. Surgió hace un tiempo la idea de relanzar la revista de la escuela para intentar mejorar el conocimiento de todos sus miembros de los eventos y actividades que tienen lugar en la escuela. <strong>Diversas asociaciones, organismos y empresas</strong> tanto de fuera como de dentro de la UPM ya han mostrado su apoyo a este proyecto, pero por desgracia todos los recursos aportados aun son insuficientes.</p>
<p>Se trata de un proyecto <strong>sin </strong><strong>obtencion de beneficio económico</strong> dónde todos los ingresos irán destinados a la publicación de la revista y a la financiación de proyectos que cumplan con el mismo objetivo de mejorar la comunicación entre colectivos de la ETSIME.</p>
<p>Gracias a todos vosotros podremos conseguir una Escuela más <strong>interactiva, comunicativa, abierta y divertida </strong>con participación de todos nosotros.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Lo que necesitamos</h3>
<p>Debido al <strong>alto precio de las imprentas</strong> nos esta costando mucho conseguir toda la financiacion necesaria para materializar el proyecto. Necesitaremos unos 2000€ para publicar durante <strong>este curso</strong> todos los ejemplares que tenemos pensados, unas 5 ediciones + la edición especial de Santa Bárbara (con todas vuestras fotos en color!!).</p>
<p>Esta revista esta <strong>abierta a todo el mundo</strong> que quiera participar o publicar en ella, y nos servirá para conectar a todos los miembros de la escuela y visibilizar mucho más las actividades de las asociaciones. Queremos que se trate de una publicación que responda a la necesidad de informacion y comunicación entre todos los alumnos y todos los organismos que componen la ETSIME.</p>
<p>Aunque no se consiga llegar al objetivo de la campaña de crowdfunding, <strong>¡¡cualquier colaboración es bienvenida!!,</strong> nos ayudará a ir publicando los primeros números de la revista. Esto es muy importante ya que de esta manera podremos atraer a patrocinadores que quieran apoyar a la revista.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>El impacto en la Escuela</h3>
<p>La publicación de la anterior revista (hace ya 3 años del su último ejemplar) mejoró notablemente la comunicaión y la relacion entre las asociaciones, la escuela y los alumnos. Desde entonces <strong>se ha perdido poco a poco la sensación de comunidad</strong> entre los grupos que forman la escuela. Pretendemos revertir este pérdida y recuperar esa sensación mediante la publicacion de una nueva revista, y <strong>crear un referente común donde cualquier sector pueda expresarse.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Retos</strong></h3>
<p>Nuestro principal reto es generar contenido suficiente para llevar a cabo las ediciones que queremos publicar de la nueva revista. Para ello hemos diseñado una estrategia eficiente para llevar a buen puerto el proyecto:</p>
<ul>
<li>Al contrario que nuestros predecesores, queremos publicar <strong>ediciones más cortas pero mensuales</strong>, lo que  nos permitirá abaratar costes y poder general menos contenido de una forma contínua y con una dinámica de trabajo establecida.</li>
<li>Un sistema de <strong>mecenazgo y financiación</strong> que permite financiar la revista, con el apoyo del resto de <strong>asociaciones, la dirección de la escuela y empresas y organismos proximos.</strong>
</li>
<li>Una estructructura de trabajo basada en delegar responsabilidades a <strong>personas capaces y con espíritu de trabajo y voluntad de hacer de la ETSIME un lugar mejor</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>¡Que no puedas colaborar económicamente con nostros no significa que no puedas ayudarnos! Esta es una lista de cosas que puedes hacer:</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>I am Cassandra Parker. I love the arts in all forms. Artist endeavors bring joy, a vision of the world, are passionate, and creative. I am the author if the Ride With Harley series. As I entered the writing life  I noticed in various writing groups a large number of talented people cannot get their work in print. In talking with artists, poets, and photographers, many had the same challenges.</p>
<p>My plan is to start an indie publishing company aimed getting unusual creative work to the public. These artists have stories that need to be told.</p>
<p>Contributions will go a long way toward reaching this goal and giving a voice to artists whi might not otherwise get their stories told. I am aiming to publish work from around the world, thus bringing a unique viewpoint to their work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking for $2,500 usd to pay for initial copyright registration, printing, cover design, marketing, and shipping.</p>
<p>F I don't reach my entire goal the funds collected will still be used to help started. Full production will take longer to reach.</p>
<p>i am offering a unique perk: an autographed paperback copy of the first book.published.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Unique artists will be given a voice to tell their stories to the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any venue there is a risk failure.</p>
<p>I am building a dedicated team who will fine tooth comb every aspect of our venture. I have a list if potential editors, art directors, and designers ready to work smart and hard to make this project a success.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't financially help out, please post this campaign to your social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, My Life, blogs, Instagram, etc. Every effort made is appreciated.</p>

I am Cassandra Parker. I love the arts in all forms. Artist endeavors bring joy, a vision of the world, are passionate, and creative. I am the author if the Ride With Harley series. As I entered the writing life  I noticed in various writing groups a large number of talented people cannot get their work in print. In talking with artists, poets, and photographers, many had the same challenges.
My plan is to start an indie publishing company aimed getting unusual creative work to the public. These artists have stories that need to be told.
Contributions will go a long way toward reaching this goal and giving a voice to artists whi might not otherwise get their stories told. I am aiming to publish work from around the world, thus bringing a unique viewpoint to their work.

What We Need & What You Get
I'm looking for $2,500 usd to pay for initial copyright registration, printing, cover design, marketing, and shipping.
F I don't reach my entire goal the funds collected will still be used to help started. Full production will take longer to reach.
i am offering a unique perk: an autographed paperback copy of the first book.published.

The Impact
Unique artists will be given a voice to tell their stories to the world.

Risks & Challenges
As with any venue there is a risk failure.
I am building a dedicated team who will fine tooth comb every aspect of our venture. I have a list if potential editors, art directors, and designers ready to work smart and hard to make this project a success.

<p><i><strong>""I bid you welcome...""</strong></i> Well, if you are here then you are someone whom is familiar with the subject of <i>London After Midnight,</i> starring Lon Chaney, the pioneering “Man-of-a-Thousand-Faces”. Directed by Tod Browning and released in 1927, critical consensus of the film was mixed...<i>But of course, you knew that already didn't you? </i></p>

<div>However, in the mid-1960s, a fire broke in the MGM vaults claimed what is thought to be the last known print of <i>London After Midnight</i>; a tragedy which has since, garnered it the legendary status as the “Holy Grail” of the lost silent film era. While numerous claims persist that a print may still exist <i>somewhere</i> in the world, all ""theories"" have so far proven fruitless and the wishful thinking of Chaney fans! Over ninety-years-later, so far, all we have been accustomed to is a series of photographs capturing Chaney’s iconic vampire, as well as many production notes and publications, yet, any trace of the film itself remains unfound and presumably lost forever.</div>

<p>Various reconstruction attempts of the film, <i>although impressive and valiant</i>, have only added to the mystique of <i>London After Midnight</i>’s legacy; in 1985, author, Philip J. Riley, created his own photo-reconstruction of the film’s plot. Then, in 2002, TCM presented a motion reconstruction of the film, completely comprised of still photographs, regarded as the nearest experience to seeing the film as was originally seen.</p>

<h2><u><strong>How is this book different?</strong></u></h2>
<p>With an affinity for the silent era, and a fascination of Lon Chaney, I set out to discover as much new material on <i>London After Midnight </i>as possible! With hard graft and many, many, many amazing and helpful leads, my research has resulted in perhaps the best discovery to-date on the so-called ""lost"" film... During my searching I was eventually blessed to discover over 30 frames from Lon Chaney's films which included the lost <i>London After Midnight</i>! My eyes went as wide as the vampire itself staring back at me on the fragments. ""FINALLY"" I thought! This, along with my many other discoveries, could now become the foundation for the book I always hoped to make since childhood and release a chunky book any die-hard Chaney fan would love to own!</p>
</div><div>

<p>There have been a sleuth of articles and various book publications; a most-notable publication was by Thomas Mann; responsible for discovering a previously-unknown novelised magazine story for the film.

<h3><b>Project Summary</b></h3>
<p>I would like to introduce you to
a 14-year-old boy with some very unique abilities. Taking place in the 21st
century, Arthur S. Holmes was born in London, England and was adopted by an
American family shortly after the accidental death of his parents. Arthur
discovered, at a very early age, that he has abilities that others, even
adults, don’t have. The first and most dramatic ability that he discovered is
his ability to remember just about everything. Arthur has an eidetic memory. At
first, it drove him crazy and he wasn’t able to cope with it. As he grew older,
he learned to use this unique feature to help him and others in their daily
lives. Along with his memory, Arthur can read extremely fast and fully
comprehend all that he has read. He finishes full-length novels in a day and
loves everything he reads. At the age of 10, he discovered one particular
author by the name of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Arthur fell in love with the
character, Sherlock Holmes. Having the same last name and similar abilities as
the famous detective, Arthur swears that he is the descendent of the famous
detective. It is then that Arthur decides to take on the name, Sherlock. After
reading and re-reading the Sherlock Holmes novels and stories many times over,
young Sherlock Jr. begins to hone his abilities of deductive reasoning. With
his constant companion, a Golden Retriever that he named, Watson, he sets out
to solve crimes. Not childish “who took my cell phone” complaints but major
crimes that perplex even the police department. All during his work as a young,
private consulting detective, he is constantly engaged in proving that Sherlock
Holmes was a real person and that Holmes is, indeed, Arthur's own great
grandfather. With his father being a television news anchor and having a true
life arch enemy, Sherlock Jr. proves that youth is nothing to laugh at.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sherlock Jr.'s Hat</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with the actual printed
(and e-book), there will be many features that will enhance the storyline of
the Sherlock Jr. series. There is a Twitter account that was opened by none
other than Arthur S. Holmes, himself. This is where he can share his ideas,
thoughts, and clues with the readers of the book. The tweets will be written as
though the main character is writing them directly to the readers. The Twitter
account is @imsherlockjr. Another feature that will be corresponding with the
books will be special videos on the internet that give a little bit more
information about the cases in which Sherlock Jr. is involved. To view these
videos, you will be able to scan a QR code or type in a URL to get directly to
the videos that are hosted on the Internet. Of course, there is a Sherlock Jr.
Facebook page that gives steady reports as to the current situation of the
books and the storyline. This is where the audience may interact with me as the
author.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>What
We Need and What You Get</b></h3>
<p>As with any project, there are
certain costs that come with its creation.  I am planning on publishing
the first book myself.  If that doesn't work out due to unforeseen
reasons, I will be searching for a publisher.  Either way, I am determined
to publish the first book along with the remainder of the series.  The
amount I am requesting is $8,000.  If I go beyond that amount, I plan on a
great deal more to enhance the quality of the story.  I will be adding
videos with live actors, Twitter feeds by Arthur S. Holmes, himself and many
more exciting little additions.  If the funding is substantially higher
than what I have requested, I plan on turning Sherlock Jr. into a television
show.</p>
<p>Along with the pride in being
part of a great story and helping young adults to improve their reading skills,
you will receive many perks, depending upon the amount you generously
donate.  Starting from simple illustrated wallpapers for your computer
desktop, all the way to having the first book dedicated to YOU, there are many
exciting perks that you will be claiming once you help out by donating.</p>

<h3><b>About the Author</b></h3>
<p>Very few people have the good fortune of ideas
finding them.  It's not just that I had a great idea, it's that I even
know the date that the idea came to me.  It was August 28th, 2015,
somewhere around 7:45 in the morning.  I was getting ready for the day
when a most fantastic idea struck me.  But, I'm getting a bit ahead of
myself.  Let me start from the beginning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445899310/xjhtrgu0z2tggi0l2sjm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<blockquote><p>Splash Page

<p>I graduated from Long Island University, C.W. Post
Campus with a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts.  I wanted to be a cartoonist
and had the greatest of luck by living in between two of the best golden age
comic book artists that ever were and my college allowed them to teach me.
 It was a dream come true.  I began learning from Frank Giacoia and,
after his unfortunate death, Joe Giella completed my training.  From then
on, I was a cartoonist and graphic artist.  I have done many freelance
jobs that included well known characters such as: Spider-Man, Bugs Bunny, Dick
Tracy, and many others.  In 1993, I became very close to a well-known
character, Sherlock Holmes.  I had obtained the rights from the Conan
Doyle estate to create my own comic strip with the name <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> as
the title.  It was published in newspapers around the country.  I
became very attached to the character and when I stopped writing and
illustrating the strip, I knew that was not the last I would see of the great
detective.  Because of the quality of the strip, I was granted a contract
to write a book on how to draw superheroes.  The book was published by
North Light Books and was titled, <i>How to Create Action, Fantasy, and
Adventure Comics</i>.  It went through three printings before it was
discontinued (You can still find it on <a href=""http://amazon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Amazon.com</span></a>).  That was my first taste of
serious writing and I was hooked.  I thought that I had the best abilities
in the world.  I could draw AND write.  I can't keep this to myself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cover of Book</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1994, my wife and I moved down to Florida.
 I continued my freelance work but wanted to share what I knew and learned
about art.  Six months later, I was granted the art teacher position at
Meadow Park Elementary School where I still teach... 21 years later.  All
during my teaching, I obtained many art jobs and created my own art.  I
was constantly running around, looking for something better.  To improve
myself even further, I attended Full Sail University in Orlando, Florida where
I received my Master's of Science Degree in Education.  But, even that
wasn't enough.  Right after graduation, I started my business, Zephyr
Multimedia, LLC where I began to create apps for the Apple iPhone and iPad.
 I loved it but, after having eight apps on the App Store, I realized that
I was slowly getting away from my artistic background.  I wanted to get it
back.  For quite a long time, I considered writing a children's book but
knew how difficult it is to get one of them published since so many people want
to do the same thing.  I wanted to be part of something very special.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sherlock
Holmes Pen &amp; Ink</p></blockquote>
<p>Some years prior, while I was at Full Sail, I
started to play around with a website called, Second Life.  I had a blast.
 I was even able to meet, face to face, with my old friends from Long
Island... well, computer face to computer face... I mean, we were avatars.
 But, it was great fun, nonetheless.  One area that I visited often
was the Star Trek world.  I created an Admiral avatar and piloted a star
ship.  That is when I came up with the idea that I wanted to write a Star
Trek novel and be part of that great franchise.  I had a fantastic idea
and began to write.  Well, one day, when shopping at the book store, I
wanted to see what company publishes the Star Trek books.  I randomly
chose a book off the shelf to look at the copyright page and was devastated.
 I read that back cover and the description of the book was almost exactly
my idea.  I couldn't believe it.  The author obviously didn't steal
it from me, since I didn't even know him.  So, I had to drop that idea and
look for the next one.  Well, it didn't take long.</p>
<p>The next morning, on August 28, 2015, I remembered
my love for Sherlock Holmes and wanted to revisit the idea of working with him
again.  I wanted to use the thought of Holmes but not him.
 Immediately, a younger version of Holmes came to mind.  Young Sherlock
Holmes?  Nah, it's been done and I definitely don't want to go up against
Steven Spielberg with legal battles.  So, how can this work for me AND
ONLY ME.  After thinking for a while and playing with the name of Sherlock
Holmes, I (pretty quickly) came up with Sherlock Jr.  It's not Sherlock
Holmes but a young man at the age of 14 who truly believes that he is the
living ancestor of the greatest detective in the world.  His name is
Arthur S. Holmes but he prefers to be called, Sherlock.</p>
<p>From that point, the whole world started spinning
faster.  I did some internet searches and found that the closest thing is
the film created in 1924 starring Buster Keaton.  But, this motion picture
is so different in theme that I wasn't even coming close to the same idea.
 After feeling comfortable that it was mine and mine alone, I began to set
up a website,<a href=""http://www.sherlockjr.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.sherlockjr.net</span></a> (which
is still in the works), an AudioBoom podcast to talk about my creative journey,
and the Facebook page and Twitter account previously mentioned.  I am
currently in the process of trademarking the name, Sherlock Jr.  So, I am
now ready for the next step.</p>
<p>Indiegogo was my next thought.  This is
something that, I feel, is such a great idea and it will help young adult
readers to become acquainted with the character, Sherlock Holmes.  The
only thing missing is the finances for me to continue to follow the path to the
final creation and publication of the first book in this series.</p>
<p>With your kind and generous donations, I will be
able to pay for all the legal paperwork that comes with the protection of a
name and the story along with the costs of editing the story, printing the
actual books,  the fees involved in research, marketing and publicizing
the book, and, finally, the distribution of the books to stores around the
world.</p>
<p>Sherlock Jr. is an opportunity to help young adults
to have a passion for reading and learn about one of the greatest characters
that has ever been penned.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

<h3><b>Risks
and challenges</b></h3>
<p>As with any major project, there
are certain risks and writing a book is no different. A problem is only a
problem when it can't be solved. There are many ways to solve every problem
that may arise from writing and publishing a book.</p>
<p>Perhaps there may be a time when
I am unable to imagine a certain situation in the story. That would be best
known as ""writer's block"". I am not fearful of such a dilemma due to
the fact that I have a group of co-workers that have tremendous imaginations.
It would simply take a brief meeting and, perhaps a few cups of latte' at the
local Starbuck's, with one or two of my close friends to extract the particular
text from my mind. At that point, I would be right back at my writer's desk
plugging away.</p>
<p>Finance is one of the biggest
reasons that many fantastic ideas never came to see the light of day. This
wouldn't happen with Sherlock Jr. The main reason that I am submitting this
Indiegogo request is to be absolutely sure that Sherlock Jr. fully and
completely finds it's way to print. I will be using the finances that I receive
from Indiegogo to publish and promote Sherlock Jr. Other than that, writing is
a career that has very little overhead to speak of. I already have a computer
and accounts with all the companies that I need to be connected such as R.R.
Bowker for my ISBN number and Dunn and Bradstreet for my credit to name just a
couple. So, there would be no stopping Sherlock Jr. due to money.</p>
<p>Finally, the only other
stumbling block that might creep it's way into my development of this series
would be time. Everyone today is running around with too many responsibilities
to handle. Even I find myself forgetting small projects because I am so wrapped
up in my career or family life. I must say that, in my case, this is the easiest
risk to conquer. Being a very structured person, I set aside a specific block
of time for my most major projects. With this being done, there is no way that
I would miss out on any time to bring Sherlock Jr. to life.</p>
<p>So, you see, I am bound and
determined to make the Sherlock Jr. series, especially the first book, a
successfully completed project.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></h3>
<p>I understand that there are
those that think my idea is good and they want to support it but just don't
have the means.  If this is your case, you can still help out by
forwarding the link and talking about it on your Facebook page or Twitter
account.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could help that way as well
as financial help OR if you don't have the financial means.</p>

You So Much For Whatever You Can Do!</b></h3>

Holmes?  Nah, it's been done and I definitely don't want to go up against
Steven Spielberg with legal battles.  So, how can this work for me AND
ONLY ME.  After thinking for a while and playing with the name of Sherlock
Holmes, I (pretty quickly) came up with Sherlock Jr.  It's not Sherlock
Holmes but a young man at the age of 14 who truly believes that he is the
living ancestor of the greatest detective in the world.  His name is
Arthur S. Holmes but he prefers to be called, Sherlock.
From that point, the whole world started spinning
faster.  I did some internet searches and found that the closest thing is
the film created in 1924 starring Buster Keaton.  But, this motion picture
is so different in theme that I wasn't even coming close to the same idea.
 After feeling comfortable that it was mine and mine alone, I began to set
up a website,www.sherlockjr.net (which
is still in the works), an AudioBoom podcast to talk about my creative journey,
and the Facebook page and Twitter account previously mentioned.  I am
currently in the process of trademarking the name, Sherlock Jr.  So, I am
now ready for the next step.
Indiegogo was my next thought.  This is
something that, I feel, is such a great idea and it will help young adult
readers to become acquainted with the character, Sherlock Holmes.  The
only thing missing is the finances for me to continue to follow the path to the
final creation and publication of the first book in this series.
With your kind and generous donations, I will be
able to pay for all the legal paperwork that comes with the protection of a
name and the story along with the costs of editing the story, printing the
actual books,  the fees involved in research, marketing and publicizing
the book, and, finally, the distribution of the books to stores around the
world.
Sherlock Jr. is an opportunity to help young adults
to have a passion for reading and learn about one of the greatest characters
that has ever been penned.
Thank you in advance for your help.

Risks
and challenges
As with any major project, there
are certain risks and writing a book is no different. A problem is only a
problem when it can't be solved. There are many ways to solve every problem
that may arise from writing and publishing a book.
Perhaps there may be a time when
I am unable to imagine a certain situation in the story. That would be best
known as ""writer's block"". I am not fearful of such a dilemma due to
the fact that I have a group of co-workers that have tremendous imaginations.
It would simply take a brief meeting and, perhaps a few cups of latte' at the
local Starbuck's, with one or two of my close friends to extract the particular
text from my mind. At that point, I would be right back at my writer's desk
plugging away.
Finance is one of the biggest
reasons that many fantastic ideas never came to see the light of day. This
wouldn't happen with Sherlock Jr. The main reason that I am submitting this
Indiegogo request is to be absolutely sure that Sherlock Jr. fully and
completely finds it's way to print. I will be using the finances that I receive
from Indiegogo to publish and promote Sherlock Jr. Other than that, writing is
a career that has very little overhead to speak of. I already have a computer
and accounts with all the companies that I need to be connected such as R.R.
Bowker for my ISBN number and Dunn and Bradstreet for my credit to name just a
couple. So, there would be no stopping Sherlock Jr. due to money.
Finally, the only other
stumbling block that might creep it's way into my development of this series
would be time. Everyone today is running around with too many responsibilities
to handle. Even I find myself forgetting small projects because I am so wrapped
up in my career or family life. I must say that, in my case, this is the easiest
risk to conquer. Being a very structured person, I set aside a specific block
of time for my most major projects. With this being done, there is no way that
I would miss out on any time to bring Sherlock Jr. to life.
So, you see, I am bound and
determined to make the Sherlock Jr. series, especially the first book, a
successfully completed project.

Other
Ways You Can Help
I understand that there are
those that think my idea is good and they want to support it but just don't
have the means.  If this is your case, you can still help out by
forwarding the link and talking about it on your Facebook page or Twitter
account.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could help that way as well
as financial help OR if you don't have the financial means.

Thank
You So Much For Whatever You Can Do!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The project, tentatively named The KDHX History Project (but sure to change before completion), will be an assemblage of 31-chapters, each dedicated to an aspect of the history of KDHX radio in St. Louis. From the methodology of individual programmers to the station's most memorable events to sidebars on podcasts, talk shows, cable access TV and more. Because it's an online project, we'll able to sprinkle in liberal amounts of photography, video and lists, lists, lists. The resultant work will be a website, organized as if a book, in which a reader can move easily through topics/chapters.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's important to note here that the project is being run with the blessing of KDHX and with the resources of the station's print and digital archives, but is being done completely independently of the station, with no funds coming from the KDHX organization.</p>
<p>The curator of the project is myself, Thomas Crone. I've been a longtime station volunteer and programmer. The monies collected, at the projected $10,000 will be broken down: 10% to editing/research/upload/tech assistance; 5% to the funding source you're on right now; 5% to event needs, for a pair of release-themed gatherings; an added 5% for surprise needs; a full 30% pulled back for taxes. The remaining 45% will offset time created in compiling, editing, interviewing, writing (and scanning what's already looking like a big mass of print materials), all with an anticipated date of web release in January of 2019.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah: we have perks!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a longtime programmer at KDHX, I've often wanted a nice, single-source location for both simple historical background on the station, but also a place to find stories told by the many, varied people who've been involved. This work will touch on all the eras, from the KDNA origin story to those amazing yogurt dishes at Squatter's Cafe, plus all the good stuff in the middle.</p>
<p>If goals are met, the site/book will be entertaining and educational, providing historical context to what we all believe is one of America's great radio stations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Two main notes here:</p>
<p>1. This project was given the blessing of KDHX's management, but is being created independently of the station, with no station funds going to the project.</p>
<p>2. I'm opting for the fixed level, rather than the flexible level. In effect, if the goal's not hit, the project won't go live. My belief is the work will amount to something valuable to the KDHX community and, though I've spent hundreds of hours volunteering for KDHX, this is a level-up need and opportunity. As noted above, the cash will allow for a large chunk of my freelance time to be spent on this project through the remainder of 2018.</p>

“Sexual abuse claims a victim every 45 seconds.” (InfoPlease, 2019)How many of those do you think keep it buried deep down inside of them because they fear of what may happen when they speak out?How many of these people are totally confused and can’t make sense of anything that happened?My hope is that by the time anybody finish’s reading this book, they will have the strength to reach out and share their story.To be vulnerable and speak openly about the experience. To drop all blame, shame and fear. To see themselves as the beautiful human being that they are, and not anything less.The reason I am crowdfunding this project is because I want the book to be completely and entirely funded by people who believe about speaking out on sexual abuse.So for anybody that has been closely or even distantly affected by sexual abuse - I am reaching out to you. I want every single person in the world that feels like this book needs to be written to have a piece of it.Please get involved and become part of this project with me.50% of ALL profits will be going to The Survivors Trust Charity, who specialise in giving care and support to survivors of abuse.Be part of this movement to help impact thousands, if not MILLIONS of lives all around the world.No one should stay silent, it’s time to break it.THE BOOK - BREAKING THE SILENCEThe backbone to this book is my story. It’s about my experience of the abuse, how it affected me growing up and how I overcame it.I go through exactly how readers can find their inner strength and courage, then use it to make sense of their story and share it in whichever way they wish.There are two other key aspects to this book, and they’re the interviews.I’ll be interviewing victims of sexual abuse, allowing them the space to share their story for the first time right inside the book. I’ll also be interviewing an abuser, someone who has sexually abused children, allowing them to also share their story.This book is going to be POWERFUL.WHAT I NEED & WHAT YOU’LL GETThis book will be published with Panoma Press, who are one of the best.We need £20,000 to get the book written, edited, designed and on the shelves.This crowdfunding campaign will be set up on a ‘pre-order’ basis. So to get involved, you simply pre-order a book (or many copies at once).For everyone who orders Breaking The Silence, I’d like to show my appreciation by including each individuals name in the acknowledgment section of the book. (If you’d like to opt out and do not wish for your name to be included, message me after ordering).As well as this, every book purchased will come complete with a ticket to the UK launch event in the summer 2020.EVERYONE CAN GET INVOLVED. Pre Ordering the book is a great way for us to generate the £20,000. Having said this, I would appreciate donations of any amount. I do not expect every person to make a financial donation. However, if you believe in the cause, please share this campaign. Spreading the word about this book is a vital step towards helping victims of sexual abuse. This is a project for the people, we need as many eyes and ears as we can get to push it out further.Share it on social media. Text your mate. Call up your cousin. Talk to your dog.Turn your silence into a whisper, whisper into a conversation and conversation into a voice. You DO have a voice.Whatever you can do to turn the volume up on our mission would be greatly appreciated.Thank you for all your love and support, you guys are rockstars! Perry Power  BIBLIOGRAPHYInfoPlease.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>""From the Universe with Love: The Spiritual Ass Kicking You Need in Everyday Situations"" will be book one of a ""Conversations with God"" meets ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" series. </p>
<p>Everyone has or will face crises brought about by their current paradigm, aka their belief-system, and the results they desire vs. the results they are getting.  The human experience called ""life"" is filled with many twists and turns that are labeled as ""challenges"", ""obstacles"", and ""hardships"" but this is due to the conditioning they have had since they were a baby growing in utero. This conditioning dictates how they perceive their current life experience, situations, and how they react as a result of the beliefs held within their current paradigm. </p>
<p>Each chapter will address an issue that mankind struggles with on a daily basis and will start with the current understanding of it as it pertains to the living, followed by a From the Universe with Love perspective, and a section called the ""Transcendence"" where it will provide tangible ways to implement these lessons into your life.</p>
<p>In future books, the ""From the Universe with Love"" series, will address worldly problems; war, violence, prejudice, terrorist attacks, etc. and the spiritual perspective the Universe offers on them. Another book within the series will address common ways people transition from this world; cancer, suicide, abortion, accidents, AIDS, etc. and the spiritual view on each of them and what happens when they become one with Universal Consciousness. </p>
<p>Many people wonder what happens to the soul when we die and what the purpose of the life experience is  -- what we learn, and the From the Universe with Love"" series will become their missing manual. </p>

<p>I started writing my first novel back in grade 10. It was in French class and I sat behind a girl that I really liked. Being a massive nerd I wasn't quite sure how to approach the topic of actually speaking or charming anyone in anyway. So I thought I would write a story. The characters in the book were all people I knew. Friends and other people from school that I didn't know that well but I thought I might like to know. I told everyone about it and got them to sign funny little contracts so that it was okay for me to use their name and description in my book. It was just as dorky as it sounds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book ended up taking me five years to write. But I did finish it. It was 1132 pages long when I was done. All of it handwritten. All of it terrible. Extremely derivative stuff. A high-concept fantasy novel that borrowed very, very, very heavily from other books. But it started me on my journey of writing. And I haven't stopped since then.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you don't really know who I am, then you could Google me or just let me give you a quick crash course in Ian Fortey.I started writing for Cracked.com back in 2007. I saw an open call for writers and I submitted an article idea. My very first article was about medication side effects. I remembered seeing a commercial around that time for a kind of medication that had the increased urge to gamble as a side effect. That struck me as very weird. So starting with that as the basis I researched more stuff and pitched the article and it was accepted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I went on to become, if not Cracked’s most prolific writer, certainly one of the top three. Later I was offered the position of managing editor of my own website. From there I went on to write for sites like CollegeHumor, Syfy, Break, Hustler, and dozens of others. I have written over 3000 articles since my first one. That's over six million words published. That's a lot of writing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recently I've started branching into fiction again. I wrote a novel called ‘ Jerry the Scary Dead Clown and Harry Houdini Save the World.’  That's been submitted to publishers and hopefully will be in bookstores before the world comes to an end. I've had a few short stories published in horror anthologies as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometime near the beginning  of covid I started making jokes on Twitter about writing a novel to make some money. Tweets to billionaires like Elon Musk and Mike Bloomberg. I told them I'd write a novel about them saving the world from Martians if they paid me to do it. There was mostly a joke, although I absolutely would have done it if anyone had replied and taken me up on the offer. But then I started thinking, why not do this for real? I had a goofy idea for a story in which a hero and his Sasquatch sidekick would take on Martians from the Moon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And so here we are. Instead of asking a billionaire to throw a pile of cash at me to write this book I am asking all of you to help me make it come to life. As you can see from the support tiers you can become the central character of the book, or just a passing name that gets dropped somewhere in the story. I thought this would be a fun way to be a part of a big, crazy story I had that could involve as many people as want to be a part of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m a fast writer, so if I can get enough money to make it worth my time to do it, I can get this written in just a couple of months. Then I can edit it, and everyone who contributes will get their own copy of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I really want to write novels for a living. That's been my dream since back in that 10th grade French class when I was trying to impress a girl. I want to be able to impress all of you with this crazy story right now, too. I've been writing professionally for 14 years so enough people in the world think I'm good enough at this job to keep paying me for it. I want to show what I can really do. Just let loose with story ideas and have some fun with it. It's going to be weird. It's going to be funny. It's probably going to have a few creepy parts as well. Those are the stories I like to write. If that sounds like fun, why not contribute? Immortalize yourself as a character in the book. Or give it as a gift to a friend. Admit it, Father's Day would be more impressive this year if you told Dad that he was going to be the Martian Viceroy. Or a robot triceratops.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that's the deal. As long as I can get enough money to pay my bills while I write the book, then I'm absolutely going to write the book. And you all can be a part of it. It's a win-win for everyone.</p>
<p>THE BOOK</p>
<p>What do I mean when I say a book? This is no picture books we're talking about here. I don't mean a short story or a novella. I mean a serious, full-on novel. At least 80,000 words in length. Like an actual, real book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The story, as far as I have it plotted out, is about a hero and a Sasquatch who lives undercover among humans fighting off an invasion plot from Martians. Is here a lot more to it than that? Of course, but I can't spoil it all here now can I?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now it's not going to be printed in hardcover or anything like that. You're going to get an e-book when this is done. Likely a PDF file that you can read on your phone, your victrola, your Zune or whatever you do that you use to read PDF files these days. I can't keep up with you kids and your technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And look at it this way. At the lowest level of support you're going to get an entire novel for $1. When's the last time you got a brand new, custom-made novel for $1? You have to go to that weird used bookstore in town that smells funny if you want a whole novel for $1. I'm not asking you to do that. You don't even need to get out of the bathtub. You can just support me here and when the book gets written, which I expect to have done sometime in May of 2021, the book will be yours. Easy breezy beautiful.</p>

We focussed on Dutch speakers, because, well, we speak Dutch. But soon enough our mailbox was flooded with this simple question: 'Where's the English version?'So here we are, hoping to put out a version fit for English speakers. Out of respect for our audience (you bet!) we need a translator. And they're costly. Because they do an awesome job! But still, costly... That's why we're launching a campaign on Indiegogo, hoping you'll want to help us put out a book that we believe is a great tool for starting journalists, curious storytellers and experienced reporters who'd like a fresh take on things.You can read a summary of the book below.Don't forget to check out our blog on www.howtostory.be.GeneralTelling stories is hard.

Les avancées de la technologie subissent depuis moins de dix ans une accélération phénoménale. Difficile par exemple de croire que l'iPhone, objet indispensable de notre quotidien, n'a pas encore fêté ses dix bougies. D'ici quelques années, le monde dans lequel nous vivons aujourd'hui nous semblera déjà complètement dépassé et certains domaines de notre quotidien quasiment archaïques.Dans cette course effrénée vers l'avenir, le Québec tient une place dont il n'a pas à rougir : jeux vidéo, effets spéciaux, réalité virtuelle, réalité augmentée, la province est en train de devenir un carrefour technologique de renommée mondiale. Pourtant, de nombreux Québécois ne sont pas au courant de cet état de fait, c'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de créer le magazine Creativa afin de faire connaître les talents locaux et leur contribution au domaine technologique.Why launch

becoming a renowned technological crossroads with a worldwide reputation. And

<p>Hi, I'm Emese Szoges. I am an author of the YA novel Liars and Scoundrels published in Hungary. I'm seeking to present charming YA stories to the readers - and now with You we can make it happen!</p>
<p>I have hired a skilled translator, descendant of '56 refugees living in the US, and with the approval of my publisher, my novel will be available in both printed and electronic versions.</p>
<p>And here is where I need You. I need your help raising money to translate my book into English. I already have a great translator, but I also need your support.</p>

<p><strong>What will happen if you’ll collect more money than the target amount?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on how much more it’d be. Depending on the amount, I can give extra goals, like hiring an artist to add more illustrations to the existing ones or to make artwork for posters.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you don't like space battles, cyborgs, diverse flawed characters, aliens, AIs, mechs, robots or bad anguage this book may not be for you.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE LAST MARINES</strong></p>
<p>Having been replaced by robots and drones, veterans Ben Corbin and Sam Garrett go into business for themselves towing derelict vessels and space junk out of the shipping lanes around Mars.<br/>Business was good but a couple of malfunctioning service robots had caused them to return to Earth for replacements. Aliens attacked the freighter they’d booked passage on, slaughtering and feeding on the crew and passengers. Only Corbin and Garrett managed to hold their own until they could hide in stasis pods.</p>
<p>200 years later</p>

THE LAST MARINES
Having been replaced by robots and drones, veterans Ben Corbin and Sam Garrett go into business for themselves towing derelict vessels and space junk out of the shipping lanes around Mars.Business was good but a couple of malfunctioning service robots had caused them to return to Earth for replacements. Aliens attacked the freighter they’d booked passage on, slaughtering and feeding on the crew and passengers. Only Corbin and Garrett managed to hold their own until they could hide in stasis pods.
200 years later
Earth and her colonies, governed by the Commonwealth of Nations, are at war with a race of aliens known as the Nineteenth. Not with the Gar Rei Jhi who had attacked Corbin and Garrett so many years past. That war had been fought and humans lost. This was a new alien threat whose origins and motives are unknown.What information humans have on this new enemy comes from the uneasy alliance with the Gar Rei Jhi who’ve been fighting an even longer war with the Nineteenth. Though long ago, Corbin and Garrett’s history with the Gar Rei Jhi hasn’t been forgotten. They are to be ambassadors serving at the pleasure of the same aliens that attacked them.
Thrust into a new age of engineered soldiers, interplanetary politics, and self-aware robots, Corbin has to quickly decide who he’s going to trust as he journeys back to the Mars colony. But his search for truth may come at the cost of his life, and the fate of the Commonwealth may rest on his decision.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><u><strong>Return to Avani</strong></u></p>
<p>Sixteen year old Tierra has no choice but to follow her instincts and the magical letter she was given to find her real home. Shadowed in the darkness of no memories, she goes on an adventurous journey. Bumping into her so called brother, a few weird and wonderful creatures and has great fun exploring new worlds. This escapade helps her grow her own special abilities, self belief and self worth. A possible love interest surfaces but there is far too much chaos around for her to focus on him. Will she make it home? Will she find her truth? Or will she pay the ultimate price? </p>
<p><i><strong>This is the Part one of six of the exciting young adult, fantasy series - 7 Pieces of 6 - </strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Story Inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>Growing up I used to escape from the pressures of competitive sport by living in these weird and wonderful places in my head. I would often escape to these worlds creating crazy creatures and people and talk my mom's ear off about them. I realize now that it played a really important role in me relaxing, refocusing and remembering my own self worth. </p>
<p>This book has been written and rewritten many times, with a short self published stint ten years ago.  Since then I have settled with the story line and I am excited to bring it to the world, with a new and fresh feel. </p>
<p>My ambition is to inspire hope and courage to any person who might be battling with difficult times, not only by reading the book but also by knowing that it has taken me courage and perseverance to put this book out there after ten years of personal growth and change. I want to show that if they can find the courage and belief in their heart anything is possible. No matter what age they are.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>I am the youngest of two sisters, grew up in Zimbabwe, then spent fifteen years in South Africa before settling in Milton Keynes (UK) at the end of 2019. I have been writing for close on twenty years now, dabbling in poetry initially before deciding twelve years ago to give novel writing a go.  My debut novel “ Return to Avani” I wrote with the hope of showcasing my love and excitement of creating and describing new worlds and characters that people can get lost in or become part of, much like I did throughout my years. I continue to learn and grow as I write the rest of the series.  It has been and still is a humbling yet exciting journey. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>In order to complete this process, I need your help! Return to Avani will be printed as a high quality, soft cover book and hard cover book. Your generous donation will go towards several aspects of the book, from the design, editing, layout, cover designs, social media marketing, printing and publishing process. </p>

<p>We are enormously appreciative of your genuine support for the crowdfunding campaign and trust that you understand that I am closing only this chapter of the book. The book of a mothers love and Nicky's life will always continue to evolve.</p>

<h3>Changing Lives</h3> <p></p>
<span>My story is about finding the will to live, and discovering a depth of courage, I hope will help parents who have lost a child and anyone who has lost someone they love.<p><span>It is about being. It's a book about a son’s profound courage and a single mother’s own “near death of self” to become a rising phoenix in spite of it all.  It is about being fully alive, in the face of death. </span></p>
<p><span></span></p></span>
</div>
<span>I hope this book will make you smile, cry and love every moment of your life and cherish your loved ones, as it is, above all else, a book about hope and discovery. Unconditional love is a rare love;  a love without strings, expectations or need.  It is the most spacious kind of love and my son Nicky gave us each a chance to learn more than we ever could have imagined.  You will treasure this book and want to give it to those who mean the most. </span>

To my friends and supporters. As we wind down the year and I approach Nicky's 10 year heavenly anniversary, the ""overwhelming"" love-felt support has made me rethink the direction of my book.
I continue on my journey of unconditional love, as any parent would. The book is a very important part of my family love, support and commitment. But there is a greater cause that I wish to embrace moving forward.
We are enormously appreciative of your genuine support for the crowdfunding campaign and trust that you understand that I am closing only this chapter of the book. The book of a mothers love and Nicky's life will always continue to evolve.

www.heart2heart.love


heart2heart   ""A Journey of Unconditional Love "" is a story of the journey Michele as a single mother and her son Nicky took in the face of Ewing's Sarcoma, a rare form of Cancer.  You will travel with them through the ups and down, share in the events that took place, the people they met throughout the journey and how they both, in a most unique approach to life, come to terms together in the face of much adversity. The story will make you cry as well as smile. As we learn through their unique experiences how death is not the end of life. This book is about the celebration of life and living it, and love as seen through the thoughts and eyes of two very unique people. A story of great value to all who may be experiencing a similar fight in life. A guide to the human soul and it unrelenting power to survive.  7 Years of writing this magnificent book, we have now released on Nicky's 10 year heavenly anniversary, a campaign in hopes to complete this beautiful story.

My book is registered with The Writers Guild of America, West, Inc.








Dad Gets Fired from His Job




In the above clip, you will find similarities that replicate Michele's story. 


Melissa Weaver gets hit in the leg during a soccer game (1992)
Nicky Bell Gets kicked in the leg at a basketball game (2001)
Melissa Weaver is disagnosed with Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)

Nicky Bell is diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma 


Current evidence indicates that both Ewing's sarcoma and PNET have a similar neural phenotype and, because they share an identical chromosome translocation, they should be viewed as the same tumor, differing only in their degree of neural differentiation. 



Melissa Weaver's Father gets fired from his job (1992)
Nicky's Mother gets fired from her job (2002)
Melissa meets Bill Clinton in the oval office (Make-A-Wish-1992)
Nicky's Make-A Wish-2002 cruise learns about the FMLA law


Melissa and her family went to Washington to fulfill the last wish of the little girl's life. The visit might not have been possible had Mr. Bill Clinton lost the election. Two weeks into the new administration, Congress passed the family leave bill for the third time. This time, it was signed into law the next day.

What We Need & What You Get Your dollars and pledges are the fuel to make heart2heart   ""A Journey of Unconditional Love "" a reality and bring it to print.  My first draft is complete and ready for the world to see.  Publishing and marketing is expensive. I have put the past seven years and nearly all my money into bringing this story to life.  I have sold my truck, taken on extra jobs and used nearly every avenue I can to get this book out into the world.  
Here are just a few of the perks that you can receive for your donations:

Private Dinner with Chazz & Gianna Palminteri
Autographed book by Robby Benson ""I'm Not Dead Yet""
Autographed basketball by Shaq
Mentalist Adult Show with Mr. Renzo
David Cone autographed baseball, hat & glove
Jerry Rice signed picture
Private photoshoot
Professional hair and makeup session
#TeamNicky Baseball Hat
  And in a passionate thanks, I have included these Perks from my heart to yours that I feel will say an adequate “thank you for your generosity”.  Please pledge whatever you can, a dollar or two helps boost our Gogo factor.   Receive an autograph book, magic show or choose any perk we have so many to offer.  You will be the person to make this book a reality. 



Changing Lives 
My story is about finding the will to live, and discovering a depth of courage, I hope will help parents who have lost a child and anyone who has lost someone they love.It is about being. It's a book about a son’s profound courage and a single mother’s own “near death of self” to become a rising phoenix in spite of it all.  It is about being fully alive, in the face of death. 


I hope this book will make you smile, cry and love every moment of your life and cherish your loved ones, as it is, above all else, a book about hope and discovery. Unconditional love is a rare love;  a love without strings, expectations or need.  It is the most spacious kind of love and my son Nicky gave us each a chance to learn more than we ever could have imagined.  You will treasure this book and want to give it to those who mean the most. 




People Nicky Touched

Nicky's journey crossed many paths, and touched many lives.  Actors, athletes, models, such as Chazz & Gianna Palminteri, Robby Benson, David Cone, Shaquille O'Neal, Vida Guerra, Mayor Ed Koch and many more. They were impacted by what an inspiring individual he was.

In this campaign some of these very individuals have committed to assist in bringing this book to the world through various gracious donations of their time.


Where will funds go?
I feel so strongly
about the message of this book, I have personally invested $12,000 of my own
funds. 
With the funds raised
for this campaign, we can complete all writing, editing, illustrations,
printing, shipping, and marketing expenses. We know exactly how much we need; these amounts won’t increase:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In order to help as many people become  as self actualized, the aim is to fund a book tour in the U.S. and Europe initially, later in other parts of the world. The purpose of my book is to raise the awareness level of people in order for them to discover their true passion and share the unique gift each of us possesses.  In this way we raise the level of awareness for all.</p>
<p>I wrote the book in 6 weeks after a Conscious Writing retreat in the U.K. in 2015. I was inspired to write it and the topic chose me. Through life events such as death of a loved one, divorce, which helped me clarify topics in the book albeit painfully at times, I did self publish in January of 2018.</p>
<p>My background as a veteran public relations and digital marketing professional of 30 years has helped me manage promotions, social media, PR with ease.</p>
<p>A portion of book proceeds will fund a center for youth awareness in Atlanta, Georgia.  It is my dream to instill self awareness in youth through mindfulness training, yoga, holistic healthcare and other education and exercise techniques free of charge to all children who attend classes or services.</p>
<p>Initially I plan on touring the Southeastern U.S. and have started doing so in Florida and Atlanta already with independent bookstores. I'd like to visit other cities and do book signings at independent bookstores. I'd like to offer the books to youth in college and high school as well. The companion work book helps people go through the process after reading the book, in order to build a daily habit of  mindfulness and figuring out what makes them happy. When people know their passion and share it  we share happiness.</p>
<p>The value to the world is to raise the planet's level of happiness to one day have a world where we are all on the same page and helping each other be at peace.</p>
<p>As a successful entrepreneur for 14 years and having succeeded at my career for 30, I am highly organized, dynamic, educated, experienced and passionate about this project.  I want to help people and I believe in the best of human beings.  I will succeed through sheer tenacity and a positive attitude if nothing else!</p>
<p>I need your help to spread the word worldwide!  I will use the funds to do a book tour and fund talks at colleges and universities to get the youth of educated world involved as well as adults.</p>
<p>With any contribution you will help share the light. I look to initially raise $10,000 to fund travel and gifts to non profits and youth organizations. If you can't contribute then if you can share on social media thank you!</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Mid-term goals suck! You do not need mid-term goals; you just need one long term goal (or vision) and a series of short-term goals in order to achieve that end goal. Having short-term goals of about a year (or less) in length ensures that you have constant tangible targets to meet, which will keep you motivated enough to continue along the journey to achieving your end goal.</p>
<p>This applies to people and businesses alike. What is the point of placing 24 or 36 month targets in the forefront, when an ever changing work environment could lead to this going to waste? Several rounds of adjustments would have to be done on those goals every quarter just to blindly re-adjust to an already blind target. It is senseless!</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Mohsen Zargaran is a speaker, author and coach who started his journey long ago. Mohsen began his journey to becoming the self-help and inspirational coach that he is today by helping friends and colleagues who were seeking a better life. He spent countless hours being a shoulder upon which they could lay their burdens, and worked with them on finding positive solutions to their problems. He has always been of the mindset that self-awareness is of great importance. Learning about the laws that govern our universe paired with a willingness and openness to change, is the very first step to removing yourself from a place of mental suffering, and on to a place of happiness and fulfillment. Try as anyone may, unless the person in question is open to change, nothing anyone else does for them will matter.</p>
<div><p>As a seasoned business manager, Mohsen led a diverse range of people, across various corporate teams in multinational companies such as Samsung, Siemens and Nokia. He understands the power of personal transformation with all his being. Mohsen went through an emotionally devastating experience that, after two years, in April 2009 led to what he has termed: “a soul awakening,” thus beginning his journey into the man that he is today. Mohsen is passionate about sharing his experience with others and see people live happily without fear or stress.</p></div>
<p>Mohsen has long transformed his boring, stressful, gloomy, and hopeless life to one that is happy, peaceful, and passionate.

<h3>The Story Behind the Idea</h3>
<p>Like many young boys, I was infatuated with machines of all kinds - cars, planes, boats, and trains. The leading interest, however, was automobiles. At six I could identify most any vehicle on the road, sometimes even the year it was produced.</p>
<p>At age 13, with some help from my parents, I purchased a 1964 Chevrolet Corvair Monza, which I still have almost ten years later (along with an acquired 1968 model as well).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614389792/cccyn7mtshzuafhlih1i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After writing children's books, I decided to write a car book. At first it started as a book with only supercars and hypercars. As I researched, I realized that the book was not unique compared with a flooded market of books about Ferrari's and Bugatti's. What followed was a massive project of listing and discovering sports cars, coupes, grand tourers (GT), supercars, and hypercars. My list grew into the thousands spanning cars from every corner of the globe. </p>
<p>Due to the size and span of automobiles in my project, it will be published as a series of multiple editions of around 500 pages each. These editions will include: early GT and racing cars from Alfa Romeo, Jaguar, Ferrari, Mercedes, and Auto Union; Eccentric designs from Bugatti, Delahaye, Auburn, and Talbot Lago; American Muscle cars from AMC, Chrysler, GM, and Ford; Design concepts from Italdesign, Pininfarina, Touring, and Zagato; record setting supercars like the Jaguar XJ220, Bugatti Veyron, McLaren F1, and SSC Tuatara; rally cars like the Abarth 131, Ford RS Cosworth, and Audi Quattro; and many, many, more! </p>

<p>This campaign is for my first Volume of the encyclopedia.

<p><b>What you Get</b></p>
<p>By buying the book through this campaign, you will be getting it for less by buying it early. Since I will be buying copies directly from the printer to fulfill the perks on this campaign, I skip the distribution costs of selling through Amazon and other retailers, which allows me to pass the savings along to my backers on Indiegogo. I will also have a limited amount of signed copies available, still for less than the Amazon retail price.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Since the book is not published, I am setting an August deadline to have the book in the publishing stage. However, sometimes formatting changes have to be made for printing, which can delay the process until revisions are made. Regardless, I am planning to stay as close to the August deadline as possible, and will update the campaign with progress reports. </p>

Like many young boys, I was infatuated with machines of all kinds - cars, planes, boats, and trains. The leading interest, however, was automobiles. At six I could identify most any vehicle on the road, sometimes even the year it was produced.
At age 13, with some help from my parents, I purchased a 1964 Chevrolet Corvair Monza, which I still have almost ten years later (along with an acquired 1968 model as well).

After writing children's books, I decided to write a car book. At first it started as a book with only supercars and hypercars. As I researched, I realized that the book was not unique compared with a flooded market of books about Ferrari's and Bugatti's. What followed was a massive project of listing and discovering sports cars, coupes, grand tourers (GT), supercars, and hypercars. My list grew into the thousands spanning cars from every corner of the globe. 
Due to the size and span of automobiles in my project, it will be published as a series of multiple editions of around 500 pages each. These editions will include: early GT and racing cars from Alfa Romeo, Jaguar, Ferrari, Mercedes, and Auto Union; Eccentric designs from Bugatti, Delahaye, Auburn, and Talbot Lago; American Muscle cars from AMC, Chrysler, GM, and Ford; Design concepts from Italdesign, Pininfarina, Touring, and Zagato; record setting supercars like the Jaguar XJ220, Bugatti Veyron, McLaren F1, and SSC Tuatara; rally cars like the Abarth 131, Ford RS Cosworth, and Audi Quattro; and many, many, more! 
This Campaign
This campaign is for my first Volume of the encyclopedia. The first edition will include cars beginning with the letter ""A"" from manufacturers like Abarth, AC, Alfa Romeo, Allard, AMC, Aston Martin, Audi, and many more. The book will be a 8.5"" x 11.25"" book in full color, with only a few black and white photos. Each page contains a large color photo, a brief history of the car, and technical specifications. The edition will be available in both paperback and hardcover copies.

<h3>Omvänt uppror</h3>
<p><strong>Tonåring och gift med en pashtun</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jag vill spela in min bok Omvänt uppror som ljudbok och ge ut den som E-bok. Den handlar om hur en stor kärlek vänds till en djupt olycklig pga religion, kultur och framförallt PATRIARKAT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jag vill berätta min historia </strong>om hur jag liftade till Pakistan och förälskade mig i en man från en hederskultur och hur de bästa avsikterna kan gå så fel och vad det beror på.</p>

<p><strong>Jag vill  beskriva med empati hur en man kan ta sig rättigheten att kontrollera och slå en kvinna. Jag vill öka förståelsen för hur religion och kultur kan förstöra ett samhälle och en stor kärlek.</strong></p>

<p>Jo, vi var unga, det var andra tider, men har så mycket förändrats, både ja och nej. Diskussionen om de patriarkala värderingarna inom religionerna är en viktig diskussion.</p>
<p><strong>Jag är inte emot mångkultur eller islam, jag är emot förtryck av kvinnan, jag vill höja rösten utan att bli betraktad som islamofob.</strong></p>
<p>Det finns mycket vackert inom tex inom den mystiska sufismen inom islam, men som det nu ser ut är sufismen oftast förbjuden. <strong>I namnet av religion, alla religioner sker förtryck.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Det fanns en tid före</strong> talibanernna, före de fundamentalistiska IS och det fanns en tid innan Ryssland invaderade Afghanistan. Det är den tiden jag pratar om, jag var 17 år och liftade genom Europa. Jag var religiöst lagd och sökare, jag var öppen för intryck. När jag träffade Shahid föll jag pladask.

<p>Because this is a children's book it is important for kids of all ages to be able to enjoy the book without damaging it. Hitting the funding goal of $4900 will allow a first run of books that includes board books for toddlers and babies, paperback books for younger children, and hardbacks for older children and adults to enjoy. $4900 includes the cost of manufacture, delivery, and storage of the first run of books.</p>
<p>If we do not reach the funding goal, then we either have to try again or shelf the project. When I took the initial pre-orders, I was only able to get five sales. The price of printing 5 paperback books was $17-25, and I can't sell the books at $10 at prices like that. I opted for all or nothing funding because it is hard to make these books happen without hitting a certain number of sales. If we don't make the full goal, your money will be returned to you.</p>
<p>But, let's try really hard to make that not be the case! Funding of this goal means the ability to provide lots of donation books for schools and children's programs. </p>

<p>I wanted to be able to offer a few different options of books, as I explained above:</p>
<p><strong>Children's Board Book:</strong></p>
<p>6.5 inches x 6.5 inches. Thick Card book with gloss pages. These are the really hard books that tend to be aimed towards small children because of how durable they are. The pages are super thick so they won't be ripped, and slobber can be wiped off of them fairly easily!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Paperback Book:</strong></p>
<p>8 inches x 8 inches. ~16 pages, made for slightly older children. This book option is more economic than the hardback, and allows more copies of the books to be donated. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hardcover Book:</strong></p>
<p>10 inches by 10 inches. ~16 pages. This book is aimed towards older children, but would be lovely for an adult to use for bedtime stories. It is also good for people who want the book to have personally--I have quite a few ""children's books"" in my personal collection! The hardcover books are in better shape, of course. Which might be important to consider if you plan to keep this book for a long time. </p>
<p><strong>Signed giclee prints:</strong></p>
<p>Because I am an artist first, my primary concern was that the paintings were moving and beautiful. I am proud to say that I created one of my favorite pieces that I've ever made. I go back and forth, but it is in my top 3 pieces of all time! My Little Girl is that print. I have picked two other prints from the book as well, ""For Always,"" and ""She's Mine Pt.2"" (named after the heartfelt song of the same title by J. Cole). Giclees are acid-free archival quality prints, printed on acid free watercolor paper with acid free ink. The color quality can last for 300 years, and they make wonderful gifts! The prints have a one inch border and are 24 inches by 12 inches. </p>

<p>The objective is to get this book in as many hands as possible. </p>
<p>If you can purchase a copy for yourself, that is great! If you can purchase copies for friends and families, that is awesome too! If you can purchase one of the gift classroom sets, that is so awesome for SO many people! The current plan is for classroom sets to be donated to teachers as well as school libraries, but in the event that there are logistical hurdles to that (such as policies for approving books) the focus will be on after school programs and daycare centers. Basically, the places where kids have lots of downtime to actually become immersed in books! The goal, too, is to also be able to get copies of the book into the hands of people who can't afford them. In order for these books to make an impact on a child's life, they have to actually make it into their hands!</p>
<p>Please spread the word about this campaign. And keep your eye out for future publications from Chromata. This is the first book, but it most certainly won't be the last!</p>

<p>Thanks for making it this far! My name is Dare Coulter, and I'm an artist, sculptor, and muralist. I work in a wide range of mediums, although my most frequently used are spraypaint, acrylic, graphite, and ceramic. I graduated from North Carolina State University's College of Design in December 2011 with a Bachelor's of Art + Design, and have been working as an artist ever since! My first full solo exhibition was in March 2016 at the African American Cultural center at NC State, and life has been spinning!  If you want to keep up with me and my art, follow my facebook page at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/DareArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/DareArt</a> or follow me on Instagram at @DareCoulter</p>
</div></div>","Because this is a children's book it is important for kids of all ages to be able to enjoy the book without damaging it. Hitting the funding goal of $4900 will allow a first run of books that includes board books for toddlers and babies, paperback books for younger children, and hardbacks for older children and adults to enjoy. $4900 includes the cost of manufacture, delivery, and storage of the first run of books.
If we do not reach the funding goal, then we either have to try again or shelf the project. When I took the initial pre-orders, I was only able to get five sales. The price of printing 5 paperback books was $17-25, and I can't sell the books at $10 at prices like that. I opted for all or nothing funding because it is hard to make these books happen without hitting a certain number of sales. If we don't make the full goal, your money will be returned to you.
But, let's try really hard to make that not be the case! Funding of this goal means the ability to provide lots of donation books for schools and children's programs. 


I wanted to be able to offer a few different options of books, as I explained above:
Children's Board Book:
6.5 inches x 6.5 inches. Thick Card book with gloss pages. These are the really hard books that tend to be aimed towards small children because of how durable they are. The pages are super thick so they won't be ripped, and slobber can be wiped off of them fairly easily!
 
Paperback Book:
8 inches x 8 inches. ~16 pages, made for slightly older children. This book option is more economic than the hardback, and allows more copies of the books to be donated. 
 
Hardcover Book:
10 inches by 10 inches. ~16 pages. This book is aimed towards older children, but would be lovely for an adult to use for bedtime stories. It is also good for people who want the book to have personally--I have quite a few ""children's books"" in my personal collection! The hardcover books are in better shape, of course. Which might be important to consider if you plan to keep this book for a long time. 
Signed giclee prints:
