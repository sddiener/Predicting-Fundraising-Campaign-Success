<p>I am recording 9 songs for
a new album/CD release.  The project is called Color Wheel and will
feature 7 new original songs.  This is my third CD.  The other 2 (Grace
and Elbow Grease, released end of 2013 and Transitions released at the end of
2011) I financed myself but this one I need your help to complete.</p>
<p>During 2015, I went
through some big changes in my life personally and spent a lot of time writing,
reflecting and honing my musical skills.  That process and time has
resulted in some new songs that are a departure for me musically and that I am
very proud of.</p>
<p>I am working with amazing
musicians who are also my friends.  I have known them and worked with them
for a few years now.  We have similar spirits and connect on many levels. We are trying to be the best human beings we can be not just the best musicians. <b>The</b> <b>Core Four</b> are <b>Ben Wisch</b>, 2 time grammy
award winning producer and keyboard/piano player, <b>Eugene Ruffolo</b>, one of the
top NYC singer/songwriters is playing acoustic guitar and singing background
vocals, and <b>George Naha</b>, who is my co-writer and one of the tastiest electric
guitar players, and myself.  In addition to the Core Four, Zev Katz is on
bass and Chris Marshak is on drums and percussion. Jonathan Preddice plays cello on 3 of the songs as well.</p>
<p>I have already recorded most of the tracks for the songs but still have a lot to go.  We, <b>The</b> <b>Core Four</b>, have been
recording the tracks live.  You can feel the energy between us.  We
are all in one room together… we make magic and it is really fun too!  After that, bass and drums are added… and a guest artist or so.</p>
<p>The money raised will be
used to finish recording the tracks (musicians, mixing, studio time), mastering
the project, manufacturing the CDs and the Vinyl LPs, distribution, radio
promotion in both the US and Europe.</p>

 Hey there! Thanks to you I've been performing as Vic Volare for 20 years. I've dedicated myself to playing the mid century modern music of the Rat Pack Era with all my heart and soul and your support has made it possible. Here is a video with footage from the Front back in 1996 or 97.

You can see the scene was electric! As a show of thanks to the thousands of V.L.O. fans, on Saturday June 11th I'm going to have a Fabulous Bidecennial Extravaganza at the Parkway Theater to celebrate those 20 years. Along with my smooth vocal stylings, the F.B.E. will feature magicians, singers, and big band with over 20 other musicians who have performed with me over the years. With such a cavalcade of talent the costs really add up. Even if the venue sells out it's difficult just to break even. I need your help to make the F.B.E a success!
Here's what you can do:


GO TO THE SHOW! Pic a Show Go Perk and enjoy the F.B.E.


Pic a NO GO Perk   Can't be there but want to be part of the F.B.E. dream

BRAG ABOUT YOURSELF!  YOU are a part of the 20 years and still swingin' legacy that is the VOLARE NATION!  The world of Facebook, twitter, Instagram and whatever social media you prefer needs to know this information. 

   What We Need & What You Get


We need $5,000 to fund the production. The money will go directly to pay: 








the performers


venue rental

Big Band music and stands

promotional expenses


What you get will vary according to how much you give. 

There are loads of swanky goodies from the Volare archives just waiting for you. Scroll through and find which one suits you best. speaking of suits you may want to direct your to the WEAR VIC""S SPARKLE JACKET Perk. Over the years hundreds perhaps even thousands have requested to wear Vic's Sparkle Jacket. The answer has always been ""NO""....Until now!

Once constructed ""The Dave Good Show"" will travel America bringing astute audiences and brilliant artists together. These shows and film festivals will take place in open spaces in mostly natural but sometimes urban environments. Shows will include combinations of music, cinema, dance, storytelling, comedy and other art forms. All equipment required will be contained inside Dave's mobile production apparatus. </div><div>

<h2>Who is Dave Good?</h2>
</div><div>Dave Good is a legendary heretic and live show producer. He was mentored by one of the best crews in the world (Walker Art Center) and has worked on an astounding array of shows. He received a production credit on a Merce Cunningham/Charles Atlas movie at The Whitney Biennial. He's hugged several of The Dap Kings. He's done customer service for Steve Martin. His dad fixed Billy Joel's teeth. Few people in this world care more about audiences and artists than Dave. He's been working on this particular show concept for about 15 years. It's been a long time coming but plenty of qualified taste makers have confidently awaited a tour de force. This is it.</div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458164697/dgel7ind4cd3k9npsjrv.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 298.301px;height: 398px;cursor: nw-resize;background-color: initial;""/></div><div>
<h2>How will he spend this money?</h2>
<div>Dave will buy a unique travel trailer for $5000 and spend $2500 renovating it. He will then buy a used truck to tow it for $12,000 and bank and extra $2500 for future repairs. He'll spend about $2000 on mics, speakers, chairs, tents, a projector etc. And then $1000 on incidental expenses and marketing costs.</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Add that all up and you get 25k.</span>
</div>
<h2>How will he pay the artists?</h2>
<div>With a membership program. Think of The Dave Good show like Costco but for festivals. Members will get preferred access to all events and their fees will create a low cost experience. Food and drink will be cheap. Non-members can either sign up on site or pay a little extra to compensate. Artists, Non-Members and Members will be taken care of at a museum quality level.</div>

</div></div>","A Vehicle for CollaborationDave Good is building a mobile production apparatus and he needs your help. Once constructed ""The Dave Good Show"" will travel America bringing astute audiences and brilliant artists together. These shows and film festivals will take place in open spaces in mostly natural but sometimes urban environments. Shows will include combinations of music, cinema, dance, storytelling, comedy and other art forms. All equipment required will be contained inside Dave's mobile production apparatus. 

Who is Dave Good?
Dave Good is a legendary heretic and live show producer. He was mentored by one of the best crews in the world (Walker Art Center) and has worked on an astounding array of shows. He received a production credit on a Merce Cunningham/Charles Atlas movie at The Whitney Biennial. He's hugged several of The Dap Kings. He's done customer service for Steve Martin. His dad fixed Billy Joel's teeth. Few people in this world care more about audiences and artists than Dave. He's been working on this particular show concept for about 15 years. It's been a long time coming but plenty of qualified taste makers have confidently awaited a tour de force. This is it.
How will he spend this money?
Dave will buy a unique travel trailer for $5000 and spend $2500 renovating it. He will then buy a used truck to tow it for $12,000 and bank and extra $2500 for future repairs. He'll spend about $2000 on mics, speakers, chairs, tents, a projector etc. And then $1000 on incidental expenses and marketing costs.

Add that all up and you get 25k.

How will he pay the artists?
With a membership program. Think of The Dave Good show like Costco but for festivals. Members will get preferred access to all events and their fees will create a low cost experience. Food and drink will be cheap. Non-members can either sign up on site or pay a little extra to compensate. Artists, Non-Members and Members will be taken care of at a museum quality level.


HOW BIG IS THIS THING GOING TO GET?
Big. Really big.


What do I get if contribute?
Perks start at $5 and go up to $23,000. All kinds of cool custom stuff and opportunities for epic experiences. Dave will even rescue a dog. Much like a rescue dog, if you help Dave Good with his show, he will be loyal for life.







What if I'm rather broke and I still really want to help?


Well then you are a lot like Dave. Tweet it share it love it repeat it. Trust me helping will feel fantastic. Whatever you can do set Dave free. All he wants is to make a more beautiful and inspiring world. 
(Also, let's be honest, nearly all of us have a spare 5 bucks.)

WHY DO I FEEL SO WARM AND FUZZY ALL OF A SUDDEN?
Welcome to The Dave Good Show. Let's build it. They will come.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Starseed is an album about who I am. For those of you who don't know me, I have always stayed true on my own path. I have grown up in many households and lived in many cities. I am a chameleon who speaks four languages and I love singing and rapping in all of them (<a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/astrolean"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.soundcloud.com/astrolean</a>). I sang in choir growing up and performed in musicals, school plays, and even regional singing competitions. My love for pop music remains the same as always, thanks to being raised with many late night dance sessions DJed by my older sister.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I was inspired to record my own album after spending almost 2 years traveling and working overseas. While I was abroad in Europe, I was able to redefine myself as an artist. While working a day job in Prague with the Czech Embassy, translating and assisting foreigners with their Visa process, I saw firsthand how much power language yields. Since I was privileged enough to give foreigners the opportunity to start a new life in the Czech Republic, I began exploring other ways I could impact the world. It wasn't long before I started experimenting with song lyrics in Czech, Dutch, and English.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I am 21 years old now and have spent the last 6 months living and recording my album in San Francisco and Hollywood. So far, I have already worked with some amazing producers and engineers (including Berklee Alumni and producers affiliated with Kid Cudi). These past several months have definitely been the most exciting of my life. However, they have also been the most difficult financially.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Supporting myself independently in California means almost all of my money goes towards the basics like rent, food, and transportation. What I am asking of you is to help make my dream a reality by pledging a gift to my campaign. Donate and be a part of the process!</p>

<p>Post-rock, noise rock, math rock, indie rock ... call it what you like: <b>Victory Hands</b> are an Atlanta-based trio of veteran musicians playing it. Angular rhythms and anthemic melodies meet lyrics taken straight from the tapes and speeches of Richard Milhous Nixon. The paranoia, stilted language and rah-rah aggression of Nixon and cohorts combines with intricate music to create an oddly compelling form of abstract punk-rock poetry. But hell, don't take our weird word for it. Listen for yourself:<br/></p>

<div>This is a Pre-Order Campaign. Our goal, at minimum, is for this campaign to recoup the cost of printing and manufacturing that we've already paid out of pocket (about $3000). But your participation in this campaign is <b>Zero Risk</b> -- the record is already recorded. The vinyl is already pressed and in our hot hands. All we have to do is ship it. You can listen to the songs above. You can view all the artwork. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Even if we don't reach our goal, we'll still be shipping these records out immediately at the end of this campaign. That's why we're doing ""Flexible Financing"" with Indiegogo. You don't have to wait and see if we reach our goal. If you buy a perk, you're going to get it. And if we go beyond our goal, that money will ensure that upcoming Victory Hands releases already in production will also be released on vinyl with the same quality of artwork.</div>

<div>Many of you probably remember record release days. You'd go to the local record store and look to see what was coming out next Tuesday.

</div>","Who Are These Masked Men?
Post-rock, noise rock, math rock, indie rock ... call it what you like: Victory Hands are an Atlanta-based trio of veteran musicians playing it. Angular rhythms and anthemic melodies meet lyrics taken straight from the tapes and speeches of Richard Milhous Nixon. The paranoia, stilted language and rah-rah aggression of Nixon and cohorts combines with intricate music to create an oddly compelling form of abstract punk-rock poetry. But hell, don't take our weird word for it. Listen for yourself:


   
The ANDERSON Release
The ANDERSON release is the first in a long series of Victory Hands releases named after reporters who Nixon considered his adversaries. Columnist Jack Anderson, an architect of investigative journalism, was a real burr in Nixon's side. ANDERSON is being released by the HEADPHONE TREATS label (operated by Victory Hands member, Jimmy Ether).

ANDERSON includes the studio recordings of ""The Guy We Can Kick"" and ""If They Give Him The Shaft"". The 10"" is pressed on clear vinyl. The standard edition artwork is on high-quality paper, letterpress-printed with glossy black foil. The inner sleeves are also printed with black foil and include redacted original Nixon transcripts and speeches, revealing the source material for the lyrics (Henry Kissinger writes some amazing choruses, y'all).


A small number of special leather editions are also available in burgundy debossed, tan debossed and brown leather with black foil. All leather editions are hand-stitched and come with special black inner sleeves with reflective brown foil print. There are only 40 of these in existence, and we saved the 30 that came out best for you.

16bit/44.1kHz DIGTAL MASTER in lossless ALAC (will play on just about anything)

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This product is valuable to the world because it exposes young children to folk songs from around the world and the languages used in each country. It is my belief that fear is based on what we don not know, so if we can give exposure to different countries, then maybe racism and exclusion won't be so prominent in our world.

<li>Your contribution will also provide an opportunity for a 6th grader to have a professional experience in the studio. It will also enable retired folks to participate in a fun musical opportunity.

<h3><strong>Who am I and what's the plan?</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Beth Porter, an independent artist based in Wigtown, South West Scotland. As a session cellist I’ve worked with Eliza Carthy, Peter Gabriel, Newton Faulkner, The Proclaimers, The Heavy and many more, but I also write songs myself and this is a fundraising campaign to help realise and release my second solo album.</p>
<p>I have written an album’s worth of quirky, dark, catchy and endearing songs and need your help to get them recorded and released into the world! Using cello and ukuleles as songwriting tools, I’ve been working with incredibly talented musicians from Bath and Bristol (my old home) with whom I recorded and toured my first album (<a href=""https://bethporterandtheavailables.bandcamp.com/album/open-doors"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Open Doors</i></a>). These include pianist Jools Scott (a long time collaborator who has an amazing ear for hearing the potential in my songs and for transforming them, as well as taking the lead in some of the arrangements); string players Sue Lord, Emma Hooper and Ian Vorley (also long term music friends with whom I play with in Red Carousel string quartet); bass player Pete Gibbs (Rock-solid on both electric and double bass - my go-to for all bass needs!); drummer Paul McMahon (the life and soul of any party, will make you cry with laughter and has the energy and passion for playing music that matches no other); wind players Pete Judge (Three Cane Whale, Get The Blessing), Catherine Turner (top flute player) and Rob Spalding (Rivers of England). The plan is to develop the new songs and turn them into full blown arrangements with these great players. I completely trust their abilities and how we work together to turn this into a really exciting new album. They are also a lot of fun to be in the studio with!</p>
<p>Then we need to record them! My first choice of producer/engineer is <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/lukecawthra"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Luke Cawthra</a>, who I have worked with over the years on various projects. Not only does he write beautiful instrumental music that I have cello played on, but he is a talented guitar player with a great ear for a cool sound. I recorded one song with him and it turned out better than I could have imagined. His studio has a grand piano, a drum kit that he knows well, and an Elvis clock that seems to shake its legs, even without batteries!</p>
<p>We really can’t do all this without you guys getting involved. As you may know it’s a huge undertaking and expense to be able to get an album recorded and out into the world. Labels are a rare breed and long gone are the days of a big advance for recording and living. It’s much more hand to mouth, but that’s not to say that the music isn’t up to the same standards! We have got some of the way under our own steam already and are proud to be independent. However, with your support, help and investment, we can finish the album and make sure it gets heard outside the studio.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>We're asking for £8,700 which pays for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recording and mixing the album (paying musicians, engineer/producer, studio time &amp; expenses). <strong>£3,500</strong>
</li>
<li>Mastering the album. <strong>£700</strong>
</li>
<li>Manufacturing vinyl and CDs <strong>£2,500</strong>
</li>
<li>Artwork / Design (paying artist/designer). <strong>£500</strong>
</li>
<li>Making FOUR music videos to market the album - it’s all about visuals, films, Youtube etc. Many people discover music this way. We have a couple of people with cameras and ideas! <strong>£2,000</strong>
</li>
<li>Working with a plugger and marketing team to get radio play to promote the album eg BBC 6Music, online radio, local radio stations, blogs etc <strong>£1,500</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Total: £10,700 </b></p>
<p><b>I've invested £2,000 of my own money to get the project underway</b></p>
<p><strong>Rewards available:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unique super special delux <strong>SUPPORTER-ONLY</strong> collector's edition of the album on <strong>vinyl + CD</strong> or a special media-enhanced <strong>download</strong>. </li>
<li>A song written for you (inc. video / live recording)</li>
<li>A private house concert for you or your friends</li>
</ul>
<p>...and more!!  There's something for everybody with prices from <strong>£8 to £1,000</strong>. It might be nice to buy as a present for a friend or family member, or suggest it to people you know who like investing in independent projects. What ever the investment everyone will be invested in our story and we will keep you updated with where we are over the length of the campaign. </p>
<p><strong>If we don’t reach our goal in full,</strong> the marketing and videos might have to wait a bit longer as the money will go into making the album first. The album will be born, and who knows what will happen from there, but you'll definitely get your copy!!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">---</p>
<p><strong>Getting this album made is important to me</strong> as I have been involved in the making of <strong>over 80</strong> albums for other people so this is my chance to get my own music to your ears! One of the songs on this album is one of the first I ever wrote (about 13 years ago) and it’s about time I recorded it! I think the cello is an intriguing songwriting instrument that brings out different harmonies and textures to a guitar or piano and I’d love you to hear the new songs I’ve been writing.</p>
<p>I have just had a baby and moved from Bristol to Scotland so life's going to get busier and there won't be many more chances when I could make time for this project in the near future.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>This kind of funding is one of the only ways these things can happen in this day and age in the absence of a thriving music industry. Great music (which hopefully this is!) is still being made and deserves to be heard. I see Indiegogo as a much more interesting relationship between the artist and the fans where we can interact and create stories together. I’ll keep you updated with how the process is going, the highs and lows and the joys of recording. Every supporter will get the <strong>singles</strong>, <strong>special video features</strong> and any <strong>news stories</strong> before they go public, and more perks will become available as we go. I would be so grateful and over the moon if we could make this happen! Thank you :-) </p>

My name is Beth Porter, an independent artist based in Wigtown, South West Scotland. As a session cellist I’ve worked with Eliza Carthy, Peter Gabriel, Newton Faulkner, The Proclaimers, The Heavy and many more, but I also write songs myself and this is a fundraising campaign to help realise and release my second solo album.

<p>Hello Dear Music Lovers,</p>
<p>My name is <a href=""https://www.giorgimikadze.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Giorgi Mikadze</a> and I am here to invite you to join in the creation of my first record.</p>
<p>I am a musician, pianist, composer and arranger from Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, currently residing in Los Angeles after moving from NYC. Due to my diverse education (Tbilisi State Conservatory, Manhattan School of Music, Berklee College of Music and Planet MicroJam Institute) and a classical music background and extensive knowledge in jazz and contemporary music, I have always been enthusiastic about ancient music traditions and have always used that knowledge to create music that is unique and unheard of.</p>
<p>Over the course of my musical journey I was curious about unknown and unusual styles and eventually studied microtonal music in an unusual setting. I was recently very fortunate to use these new ideas at the recording session of<a href=""https://www.rarenoiserecords.com/gerschlauer-fiuczynski-dejohnette-garrison-mikadze"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Philipp Gerschlauer in the studio with the amazing drummer <strong>Jack DeJohnette</strong> </a>(Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Ornette Colman, Pat Metheny and more) exploring and recording music based on a 128 notes per octave pitch continuum – it was a magical experience.</p>
<p>I was very fortunate to perform, record and tour with many artists such as Roy Hargrove, Dave Liebman, Lee Ritenour, Meshell Ndegeocello, David Fiuczynski, Chris Potter, Matt Garrison, Nils Landgren, Jojo Mayer and many more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BUT it's time for my album now!</strong></p>
<p>This will be my first CD as a leader and composer where I will combine Georgian folk music with contemporary musical styles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>GIORGIAN MICROJAMZ</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Giorgian MicrojamZ was developed during my three month residency at 18 Street Arts Center, as the winner of the  ""Make Jazz Fellow"" program in Santa Monica, CA where I explored microtonalities of traditional Georgian folk music and integrated those structures and tuning systems into new musical motifs and compositions, often mixing with in jazz, funk, fusion, R&amp;B, African rhythms and hip-hop grooves. </p>
<p>Each composition has a special tuning system that was based on equidistant scales which perfectly fits into Georgian musical microtonal scales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The term ""microtonal music"" usually refers to music containing very small intervals but can include any tuning that differs from Western twelve notes per octave like on the piano.. Any interval, or sound less than a half tone is a microtone. The music of India, Indonesian gamelan music, Persian, Turkish or middle eastern music, they are all microtonal.  </p>
<p>The Blues has searing soulful lines filled with ""blue notes"" that are a microtonal pitches that fall in between the cracks on a piano. These are the sweet notes that you hear that any great blues rock guitar player like Jimi Hendrix would play. Without these the blues would be bland, kind of like Italian food without garlic or olive oil!!! I will use revolutionary software that allows me to use retune any keyboard in infinite ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Musicians</h3>
<p>As a musician, I place great value in the collaborative process and I look forward to working with this outstanding band:</p>

The time has finally come when I feel I need to listen to my friends and fans and produce my first album. I won’t be singing as Barbra or Celine, but as myself – because I have something to say.Have you noticed how negative the world has become? Television, social media, news networks on both sides of the aisle seem to promote division and anger. Instead of focusing on the hate and fear, I want this album to help people focus on hope and joy.  Studies have shown we tend to produce in our lives what we focus on.  Like an archer, we can only hit the target in our sites. By recording a collection of beloved songs and some originals with positive messages or uplifting melodies I hope to help listeners find their inner voice of hope and joy to embrace, instead of all the negativity bombarding us every day.To make this vision for an album that’s a voice for good is something I can’t do alone- I need your help. Financially backing this album, be it a dollar or larger amount, gives you the opportunity to be part of the team promoting something you can believe in and feel good about that may actually make a difference in people’s lives.  Expenses for creating a quality album include recording, editing, mastering, producing and distribution, to name a few. The album will be released on CD and in digital outlets, such as Spotify, iTunes, and Amazon Music.Contributors (I prefer to think of you as “team members”, for whom I’m truly grateful) will get various goodies for their financial support to this project, which you can see listed on this page. As a contributor on the team you’ll see regular updates here on this site on how we’re doing. You may also see secret “surprises” along the way that other folks won’t be privy to. Please note that we only have 30 short days to make this happen!It would also be unbelievably helpful if you would share this campaign with your friends, family, and social media connections with #ichooselove.  I’m asking you to join me on this journey to help make this album a reality and, perhaps, make a difference in some hearts and minds.  Can you imagine a world where everyone says, “I choose love”?Thank you so much!",16.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>We have been compared to Athlete, Ben Howard and The Swell Season, and our music has had airplay across the UK and beyond. We have been lucky enough to appear on stages from folk clubs to festivals including The Great Escape, Wychwood Festival, Greenbelt and Weyfest whilst earning an honourable mention at the International Songwriters' Competition final thanks to our single Dry Bones.</p>
<p>In March 2016 we released our second EP 'Light Runs After Us' featuring singles Slow to Now and Lions Roar. The latter was adopted by our hometown of Rugby as it's official song for the Rugby World Cup. The song also included the voices of 100's of local school children which led to the song being played at the Ricoh Arena with support from Wasps RFC and reached to #14 in iTunes charts.</p>
<p>Our heart is to connect with people through our stories and anthems and believe an Album for us now, will be the best way to express that and hopefully reach more ears.</p>

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p><i>Songs for Ledalero</i> is Joan Grabowski’s first CD working together with Fr. Eman Weroh, SVD, at a Catholic seminary in Indonesia!  Together they recorded 7 songs, 5 of which are in English; two of the songs were composed by Fr. Eman himself.  <a href=""http://songsoflife.co/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joan Grabowski</a> is a vocalist with over 30 years of experience as a music minister in American Roman Catholic parish and diocesan settings.  This is her 4<sup>th</sup> CD.  The others are:  <i>Take  Lord, Receive</i> with In Our Midst, <i>lifechoices</i> with pianist Ginny Butschek, and <i>In the Studio</i> with Two or More.</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise money to raise money, if you will.  This $5,000 USD will pay for the duplication of 2,000 of the new CD along with payment of song royalties.  If we can do that, then 100% of the sales of this CD can be sent directly to support the seminary.  If we raise more than the goal, believe me, that will be a huge blessing to the seminary. And you can help!  How exciting!!!</p>
<p><strong>The Seminary</strong></p>
<p>At St. Paul Major Seminary in Ledalero, Flores, Indonesia, almost 300 Divine Word Missionary (SVD) seminarians are preparing for the priesthood.  They attend school with 300 other priest candidates from other religious orders as well as the Diocese of Maumere.  Joan Grabowski, after a 30+ year career working for not-for-profit organizations and corporate America, lives at the seminary as the lone female!  This seminary is one of the largest Catholic Seminaries in the world. She works as a volunteer to help them with English language skills. They practice speaking with and listening a native English speaker before being sent all around the world as missionaries.   In addition to the 300 seminarians, the SVD community at Ledalero seminary also includes around 30 priests and brothers – and Joan, a lay missionary -- who support the seminary.  </p>
<p>Every day, seminarians tend to their gardens to raise their fruits, vegetables to eat.  In addition, they raise pigs to sell to help support themselves in their dorms.  The SVDs also have a large working farm where they raise chickens to sell eggs to produce income for the seminary.   Most of the SVDs here come from extremely simple families, most of whom are farmers who live in simple bamboo houses or concrete homes. Most do not own a car; some own a motorbike.  Here on the island of Flores, there are no Starbucks, no movie theatres, and few restaurants.  Here on Flores, there are good-hearted people living difficult lives in great economic poverty, 95% of whom are Catholic.</p>
<p>After attending daily philosophy and theology classes, the seminarians tend their gardens and their livestock (pigs and chickens) to provide most of their daily food.  In addition to their Bachelors and Masters degree studies and SVD community activities, the seminarians cook in simple “kitchens” on open wood fires or open-flame gas burners and their diet consists of rice, dried fish, and fresh vegetables and fruits. They also hand-wash their own clothes and hang them out to dry before ironing them.  There is no air conditioning, no showers and no bathtubs, no hot water in the bathrooms; and they bathe with ground water which occasionally a) runs out or b) runs brown from the water running over the Earth.  There is Wi-Fi but only when the electricity is working, and even then the signal is weak and is not sufficient to support the community of almost 300 SVD priests and seminarians. </p>
<p>The seminary is staffed by dedicated SVD missionaries who have Masters or Doctorate degrees in philosophy, theology, anthropology, or missiology (the science of religious mission).  They have so much wisdom and have dedicated their lives to forming these young men into new missionaries.  If you have time, you are invited to come visit!  You will be amazed at how much they can do with so few resources.</p>
<p>Although they are part the world-wide religious congregation of 6,000 Divine Word Missionaries, like most SVD communities, the seminary must raise more than 50% of its $500,000 USD annual operating budget to supplement what they receive from the world-wide SVD community.  In an area where the average household income is the equivalent of $3,600 USD per YEAR, fundraising is difficult.  Some help comes from Jakarta and western Indonesia which is more developed, but still -- fundraising here is difficult, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>FINANCIAL NEEDS: There are many financial needs here.  But this campaign is to raise money to raise money, if you will.  This $5,000 USD will pay for the duplication of 2,000 CDs along with payment of song royalties for producing this CD.  If we can do that, then 100% of the sales of this CD can be sent directly to support the seminary.  If we raise more than the goal, believe me, that will be a huge blessing to the seminary.</p>
<p>The sales of 2,000 <i>Songs for Ledalero</i> CDs in the USA and Indonesia will raise approximately $15,000 for the seminary! </p>
<p>These seminarians are willing to devote their lives to the service of Jesus Christ in the mission field all over the world.  You can help!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fr. Eman donated his services at no charge.  We used Fr. Eman’s sound engineer and his music studio in Indonesia.  I had the CD mastered in Dallas.  Another Indonesian SVD priest designed the artwork for the cover, again at no charge.</li>

<li>$  500……….advertising and distribution in Indonesia</li>
<li>$    50……… international bank transfer fees</li>
<li>$1,372 ……...manufacturing and digital distribution in the US (includes manufacturing, UPC barcode for retail sales, and registration for music sales through CD Baby, iTunes (through CD Baby), Amazon, GooglePlay, as well as Gracenote MusicID.</li>

<li>$1,000 (est.)...mastering at VergeMusicWorks studio in Dallas</li>
<li>$   988………miscellaneous for unexpected expenses in Indonesia, or donation to the seminary</li>
<li>TOTAL: $5,000</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What you get! <ul>
<li>Joan will email you a bonus song that was recorded with the Seminary choir of over 60 wonderful, male voices singing Panis Angelicus with her as a soloist.</li>
<li>The seminary community will remember you in their prayers. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How will CDs be sold in the US?<ul><li>CDs will be available for purchase online via iTunes, Amazon and CD Baby, (digital downloads as well as physical CDs, too).</li></ul>
</li>
<li>If we don’t reach our entire goal, the funds raised will go to producing a smaller quantity of CDs.</li>
<li>If we exceed our goal, anything extra will go directly to the seminary.</li>

<p><strong>What others say about Joan and her music:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>""Remarkably, a Caucasian lady sang the familiar Taste and See responsory in such a freewheeling, dynamic and inspirational way that she seemed to have learned the grace notes and delivery from a black Gospel singer. It qualified as blue-eyed soul.""  -Fr. Jerome LeDoux, SVD</li>
<li>""Joan has a fantastic voice."" -Joan K. G.</li>
<li>Ms. Joan has so much joy!</li>
<li>The music was very uplifting to a tired restless soul.</li>
<li>I attended (the concert) because of Joan’s voice and her holiness as it comes through her voice.</li>
<li>Christ was present and foremost in every song. This was truly a gift from above! ...It moved me to tears. Amazing! Heaven danced today!</li>
<li>It was a beautiful spiritual experience. The Spirit of the Lord is strong in your music and your love of what you are doing is apparent.</li>

After attending daily philosophy and theology classes, the seminarians tend their gardens and their livestock (pigs and chickens) to provide most of their daily food.  In addition to their Bachelors and Masters degree studies and SVD community activities, the seminarians cook in simple “kitchens” on open wood fires or open-flame gas burners and their diet consists of rice, dried fish, and fresh vegetables and fruits. They also hand-wash their own clothes and hang them out to dry before ironing them.  There is no air conditioning, no showers and no bathtubs, no hot water in the bathrooms; and they bathe with ground water which occasionally a) runs out or b) runs brown from the water running over the Earth.  There is Wi-Fi but only when the electricity is working, and even then the signal is weak and is not sufficient to support the community of almost 300 SVD priests and seminarians. 
The seminary is staffed by dedicated SVD missionaries who have Masters or Doctorate degrees in philosophy, theology, anthropology, or missiology (the science of religious mission).  They have so much wisdom and have dedicated their lives to forming these young men into new missionaries.  If you have time, you are invited to come visit!  You will be amazed at how much they can do with so few resources.
Although they are part the world-wide religious congregation of 6,000 Divine Word Missionaries, like most SVD communities, the seminary must raise more than 50% of its $500,000 USD annual operating budget to supplement what they receive from the world-wide SVD community.  In an area where the average household income is the equivalent of $3,600 USD per YEAR, fundraising is difficult.  Some help comes from Jakarta and western Indonesia which is more developed, but still -- fundraising here is difficult, to put it mildly.
FINANCIAL NEEDS: There are many financial needs here.  But this campaign is to raise money to raise money, if you will.  This $5,000 USD will pay for the duplication of 2,000 CDs along with payment of song royalties for producing this CD.  If we can do that, then 100% of the sales of this CD can be sent directly to support the seminary.  If we raise more than the goal, believe me, that will be a huge blessing to the seminary.
The sales of 2,000 Songs for Ledalero CDs in the USA and Indonesia will raise approximately $15,000 for the seminary! 
These seminarians are willing to devote their lives to the service of Jesus Christ in the mission field all over the world.  You can help!
What We Need & What You Get

Fr. Eman donated his services at no charge.  We used Fr. Eman’s sound engineer and his music studio in Indonesia.  I had the CD mastered in Dallas.  Another Indonesian SVD priest designed the artwork for the cover, again at no charge.
Now we need $5,000 to cover the following expenses:
$  900……… manufacturing 1,000 CDs in Indonesia.
$  500……….advertising and distribution in Indonesia
$    50……… international bank transfer fees
$1,372 ……...manufacturing and digital distribution in the US (includes manufacturing, UPC barcode for retail sales, and registration for music sales through CD Baby, iTunes (through CD Baby), Amazon, GooglePlay, as well as Gracenote MusicID.
$   190………mechanical licensing (song royalties) in the US
$1,000 (est.)...mastering at VergeMusicWorks studio in Dallas
$   988………miscellaneous for unexpected expenses in Indonesia, or donation to the seminary
TOTAL: $5,000


What you get! 
Joan will email you a bonus song that was recorded with the Seminary choir of over 60 wonderful, male voices singing Panis Angelicus with her as a soloist.
The seminary community will remember you in their prayers. 


How will CDs be sold in the US?CDs will be available for purchase online via iTunes, Amazon and CD Baby, (digital downloads as well as physical CDs, too).

If we don’t reach our entire goal, the funds raised will go to producing a smaller quantity of CDs.
If we exceed our goal, anything extra will go directly to the seminary.

What others say about Joan and her music:

""Remarkably, a Caucasian lady sang the familiar Taste and See responsory in such a freewheeling, dynamic and inspirational way that she seemed to have learned the grace notes and delivery from a black Gospel singer. It qualified as blue-eyed soul.""  -Fr. Jerome LeDoux, SVD
""Joan has a fantastic voice."" -Joan K. G.
Ms. Joan has so much joy!
The music was very uplifting to a tired restless soul.
I attended (the concert) because of Joan’s voice and her holiness as it comes through her voice.
Christ was present and foremost in every song. This was truly a gift from above! ...It moved me to tears. Amazing! Heaven danced today!
It was a beautiful spiritual experience. The Spirit of the Lord is strong in your music and your love of what you are doing is apparent.

<h3>Hey look, man!</h3>
<p>We are Gentleman Caller, and this will be our 6th and most important record. It is a song-by-song response to a collection of short stories by Maryse Meijer called HEARTBREAKER. This book is a life-changer. This record is meant to honor it, and Maryse has generously offered to be a part of this project with us. </p>
<p>There are a lot of great perks, but every amount helps, and SHARES SHARES SHARES (especially from my fellow musicians and artists.) When you help support an ambitious artistic endeavor, I have always believed you help enrich the world. This project, and projects like it, really depends on your support.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money we are asking for will go toward the pressing of vinyl as well as mixing and mastering. We are trying to keep costs as minimal as possible to make our goal attainable. </p>
<p>Besides being able to pre-order a great record, some of our unique perks also include signed records by Kenny, signed books by Maryse, t-shirts, lyric sheets, original demos of songs and live in-living room readings/performances by Kenny and Maryse.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Gentleman Caller have had success raising money for records before. Without it, we wouldn't be able to get records properly released on media, so that you can have something tangible in your hands. It's dark times for the music industry, so we simply have to rely on fans of good music and concepts to make it happen. This record is a particularly ambitious one, as it is the first concept record we've ever made. You'll get to hear songs of romance from all kinds of saucy and nefarious characters. It'll freak you out and break your heart. Or, anyway, that's our goal.</p>

<h3>Band Overview</h3>
<p>Plaguebringer is a Canadian metal band formed in late 2013. Since the band’s inception there has been two EPs released (Hallowed [2014] &amp; Three Kings [2017]), a music video, and two tours. Planned for the end of 2018, Plaguebringer will release their debut full-length album “Diabolos”, which is the band’s most ambitious effort yet. This is the first album in which the band will have professional help in the mixing, mastering, and production to give the songs the most crushing sound yet. Typically, we fund all of our efforts ourselves, but the cost for this album is much higher than previous records, and we need your help. By purchasing one of the many perks for the album you are allieviating financial stress on the members of the band, and ensuring this album gets the best sound possible to satisfy our fans. Regardless if we reach our financing goal or not, we are moving forward with the production of the album and making this full length album happen. </p>
<p>We hope you find a perk you like, and support this effort. We sincerely are thankful for you considering a contribution to our full length album. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $5,000 USD to fund mixing, mastering, &amp; production with Mick Kenny</li>
<li>By contributing to this cause you will have first dibs on very limited merchandise on the album, as well as a spot on the album credits, and a download of comprehesive Guitar Pro tabs of every song off of “Diabolos” (available for certain packages).</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal we will use the funds raised towards the production of the album, and fund the rest ourselves.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each song will have the best production quality possible. This is in response to the production complaints we have had with our previous albums.</li>
<li>We have released two previous albums and toured Canada independently funded (no outside or label support). By supporting us you can trust we will follow through with our commitments. </li>

<h2>Who am I &amp; why am I asking for your support?</h2>
<p>I am Matthijs Vanstaen, a musician. I've been writing and performing since I was 12 years old. It's something I need to do, it's something I love to do. I have a band called Lighthousing and I perform solo as well, with my alter ego: Taz Von Stone. All of my time, effort and money goes to these two children of mine. Yet the costs of being a musician are enormous (the rehearsal room you rent, the distances you cover, the gear you have, the gear you need, the gear that stops working and needs to be fixed/replaced with new gear, recordings, mixing, mastering, pressing,...) and never-ending. Now, having said this, I find myself in this predicament: I have recorded an entire album, I have put my heart and soul into it and I cannot wait to share it with you, the only thing is I do not have the money to finish it. It still needs to be mastered and pressed. I'm hoping I can do this with your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>W<strong>hat are the costs/where will your money go to? </strong>
</h2>
<p>Mastering will be about 990 euro's and the pressing of the cd's will be about 1050 euro's. The money collected from your generous donations will be solely used for the mastering and pressing of the album. This will also be the case if the goal is not reached, it will only take longer for the album to be released, because I will have to save up some money along the way. If the goal is exceeded, the album will be pressed on vinyl too!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What's in it for you?</h2>

<p>I am currently in the process of recording my first studio album called ""The Return"". There will be 7 original worship and prayer songs professionally recorded and I’m so excited to get them out into everybody’s hands, but I need your help to finish it. </p>
<h3>Why? </h3>
<p>I am a junior at Arizona State University, and I'm very involved at ASU’s Catholic Newman Center, leading students in music at Masses, worship nights, and community outreach. These songs were written through my experience in this ministry. Music has been a powerful influence in my own spiritual life, with power to unlock hearts and speak to them in a way words cannot. In the context of faith, it’s important to me that Music is done well and done for the right reasons. Not only can it be used to praise God, but can console a broken heart, Rejoice with the joyful, guide the lost, soften the arrogant, and inspire the numb. It is my goal that these songs would help to bring the light of Christ into the messy details of every day life. </p>
<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>In December of 2017, after a year of dedicated songwriting, I began working on this project. I am fortunate that my dad is a working musician and has allowed my friends and I to use his recording studio at night. A typical studio album costs around $15,000- $20,000. Luckily my friends have volunteered their time and the recording studio didn't cost me anything. I need an additional $2,100 to hire a mixing engineer in Nashville, Tennessee and the remainder of the money goes to graphic design and CD duplication.  </p>
<p>I am incredibly grateful for your support and cannot wait for you to hear the music!</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Wes. And I’ve been doing music for years now. It was a passion that became a calling while I was still a youth leader at my church. There I gained my artistry. And with that artistry, I became a member of a Christian rap group called The Brotherhood. We later split due to creative differences, which led me to abandon music entirely. I didn't think I would ever make music again. But after a few years of a creative drought, I found my new calling. So, though The Brotherhood's venture was short lived, it made me who I am today and who I am is a music producer. What I want is to give back and truly help make dreams possible for beginning artists.</p>
<p>This is why THE HOUSE was born. It was an act of faith after receiving the calling. I want to create the perfect environment for artists to learn and grow independently through love and support. It is also going to be the main location for The One Song Campaign, a completely free service to help new artists finish their first song. But like any house, this house is in need of support.</p>
<p>And I’m praying that by the grace of God, you will find it in your heart to help in any way you can. Whether it’s monetarily or informational, everything is a blessing. Even prayer will go a long way in the completion of this goal.</p>
<p>**ALL DONATIONS WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE HOUSE**</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Things Still Needed for THE HOUSE:</h3>
<p>Below are the many things that your contributions will be going towards. If you or if you know anyone who has and/or would like to donate any of these items (used/new) please contact me directly via the contact information below.</p>

<p>When it comes to local artists, it is very difficult to create quality music.

<h3><i>American Originals</i></h3>
<p><a href=""http://agavebaroque.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Agave</a> and Reginald Mobley are teaming up for <i>American Originals, </i>their third recording project featuring the music of underrepresented composers. We love Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms – we were raised on and inspired by those guys – but, this album features great music by composers you've never heard of, all composers of color, and all truly <i>American Originals</i>.  The incomparable Florence Price, the first woman of color to have a work performed by a major American orchestra; Esteban Salas, Cuba's first known classical composer; Scott Joplin, the brilliant ragtime pianist who started out laboring on the railroads; and Justin Holland, a guitar virtuoso and friend of Frederick Douglass (who also happened to play the violin!).</p>
<p>Agave, Reggie, and Geoffrey Silver from the <a href=""http://acisproductions.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Acis Productions</a> label will be in Fresno, California from September 21 through 26 to record this beautiful and powerful music, most or all of which you may never have heard before. We're excited to work with Geoffrey and the Acis team for the first time!  Please join us on our adventure battling smoky California air and a global pandemic that has our lives and musical season turned on its head. We're here to bring more Black and brown voices to your playlist – voices that should be part of the musical canon, and with your help, they will!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise about $18,000 to fully fund American Originals.  But, we've got money coming in from a few other sources, including our digital presentations for <a href=""http://sfems.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SFEMS</a> (San Francisco Early Music Society) and <a href=""http://sonomabach.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sonoma Bach</a>.  So, our campaign goal is $12,000.</p>
<h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3>
<p>We have some fun perks for your donations!  Our friend and brilliant photographer, Gary Payne has taken some great shots of us, including the ""Power V"" photo that leads our campaign. We're making <i>American Originals</i> ""Power V"" refrigerator magnets, masks, and autographed posters. We'll also offer autographed CDs, virtual private lessons, virtual concerts, and even a real, in-person garden concert, if you have the space for it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Black and brown composers have been creating great music for centuries, but racism in the classical music world has systematically shut them out of the 'canon' of western music – those composers whose names and works we hear repeated day in and day out in the concert hall and on the radio, and study as the bedrock of our musical heritage. Don't get us wrong, we absolutely love Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, and have made our livelihoods performing their masterworks. This album is a step toward righting this injustice and shining light on the many contributions of American composers to the diverse, multicultural world that classical music can - <i>and ought</i> - to be. It will change your perspective, as it has ours.</p>
<h3><strong>Our track record</strong></h3>
<p>Founded in 2008, Agave has recorded four commercial albums.<i> Cold Genius</i> was Agave's first, a self-released disc featuring restoration-era English music by Purcell, Lawes, Locke, Matteis, and other brooding but sparkling works. For the next three albums, Agave teamed up with the VGo Recordings label. <i>Friend of Ferdinand </i>(2013), a long time favorite on the radio, features music from the courts of the Holy Roman Emperors in 17th century Vienna, including Schmelzer, Biber, Ferro, Granata, and other not exactly household names. <i>Queen of Heaven</i>, released in 2015, was devoted completely to music by Isabella Leonarda, a 17th century Italian nun whose publishing career spanned over 60 years, and whose unique voice shines on this disc. It was Agave's first collaboration with countertenor Reginald L. Mobley.  In 2018, Agave and Reggie released <i>Peace In Our Time</i>, music from the shadow of the Thirty Years' War, a conflagration that decimated not only human life, but also culture.  These composers–Johann Christoph and Heinrich Bach, Pohle, Weckmann, Scheidt, and Tunder–drew inspiration from what they experienced around them, be it gentle, harsh, pedestrian, or sublime.  </p>
<p>This will be Agave's fifth album and our third with Reggie, and we are quite confident that with the help of Acis Productions, we know how to make a beautiful sounding, looking, and compelling disc that delights, educates, and inspires.</p>

We had all of the details worked out, including scheduling for a quiet time of year and getting to know the custodian who could help us track down and turn off all six air conditioners (!) in the building. With campuses across the world shut down due to COVID-19, OAB is not available to us this time. However, we have found another venue in Fresno, First Congregational Church, a.k.a. the Big Red Church.

<h2>Help Launch Tj’s country album, Lonesome Old Road!</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610481165/trpsgtmxfmhrskvw7vqy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Is there anything better than Montana country music? If you have never had the opportunity to hear any of this music, let me take a second to describe the sound to you. It is music that is very familiar to you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You know the stuff that reminds you of being at a country dance on a great summer night.  Music that reminds you of Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Charlie Pride…. you get the point.  The country music that we grew up listening to, but mixed with just a little bit of edge here and there.  Real country.  Not the pop-country that mainstream radio is giving us these days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My newest album, Lonesome Old Road is exactly that.  The real country you would hear played at countless country dances in Montana.  The songs have stories that you can relate to.  Real things about real people. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>History </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This album has been in the works for over a year and a half.  It started when I recorded my first single from the album, Small Town Prison.  Since then I have written several songs, picked out the best ones (and a couple of covers of some classic country songs) to get recorded.  The album is almost done, we just need to finish a couple of things </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being an independent artist is both challenging and rewarding these days, especially when it comes to the financial end.  I love the freedom. I love being able to call my own shots and make the music that I want.  I love that so many dedicated county music lovers want to bypass labels and big corporations to support me directly!  I can’t really tell you how much I appreciate that. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610670193/zk5ywbsgfncs0k9td8d3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Album</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This album consists of 10 songs, eight originals, and two cover songs.  The majority of the record was recorded in my studio in Montana, with some additional instruments and the mixing and mastering done at Opal Studios in Portland Oregon by extraordinary producer Kevin Hahn.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wanted to stay as far from Nashville as I could when making this record because I didn’t want it to sound just like everything else that is coming out of the studios there right now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wanted it to be unique and sound like Montana.  That was where Kevin comes in.  I have known him for many, many years as he is married to a school mate of mine.  In fact, her Grandma lives on the ranch right across the road from where my family ranch is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When it came time to finally start making the record, I knew he was the right guy for the job.  In fact, he described to me exactly what sound and style I was going for even before I was able to tell him what I was thinking. </p>
<p>A match made in heaven.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Behind the scenes and budget.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Having said all that - one thing that you really need in order to do anything (i.e. produce a great-sounding album, print march, tour, get the songs out to the masses, etc.)— is funding.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What does it take to make an album like this?  Well, a lot.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>In this case, financial speaking, it takes a lot more than what this campaign goal is asking. In fact, the goal I am asking for is just a very small portion of the total cost of the album and promotion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those interested in how it works, a budget like this for a mid-level album is very common (often much more)  and the money is typically fronted by a band label, which they have to pay back through album sales and touring.</p>
<p> </p>

Overview
 
Is there anything better than Montana country music? If you have never had the opportunity to hear any of this music, let me take a second to describe the sound to you. It is music that is very familiar to you. 
 
You know the stuff that reminds you of being at a country dance on a great summer night.  Music that reminds you of Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Charlie Pride…. you get the point.  The country music that we grew up listening to, but mixed with just a little bit of edge here and there.  Real country.  Not the pop-country that mainstream radio is giving us these days.
 
My newest album, Lonesome Old Road is exactly that.  The real country you would hear played at countless country dances in Montana.  The songs have stories that you can relate to.  Real things about real people. 
 
History 
 
This album has been in the works for over a year and a half.  It started when I recorded my first single from the album, Small Town Prison.  Since then I have written several songs, picked out the best ones (and a couple of covers of some classic country songs) to get recorded.  The album is almost done, we just need to finish a couple of things 
 
Being an independent artist is both challenging and rewarding these days, especially when it comes to the financial end.  I love the freedom. I love being able to call my own shots and make the music that I want.  I love that so many dedicated county music lovers want to bypass labels and big corporations to support me directly!  I can’t really tell you how much I appreciate that. 

The Album
 
This album consists of 10 songs, eight originals, and two cover songs.  The majority of the record was recorded in my studio in Montana, with some additional instruments and the mixing and mastering done at Opal Studios in Portland Oregon by extraordinary producer Kevin Hahn.  
 
 
I wanted to stay as far from Nashville as I could when making this record because I didn’t want it to sound just like everything else that is coming out of the studios there right now.
 
I wanted it to be unique and sound like Montana.  That was where Kevin comes in.  I have known him for many, many years as he is married to a school mate of mine.  In fact, her Grandma lives on the ranch right across the road from where my family ranch is.
 
When it came time to finally start making the record, I knew he was the right guy for the job.  In fact, he described to me exactly what sound and style I was going for even before I was able to tell him what I was thinking. 
A match made in heaven.  
 
 
Behind the scenes and budget.
 
Having said all that - one thing that you really need in order to do anything (i.e. produce a great-sounding album, print march, tour, get the songs out to the masses, etc.)— is funding.  
 
 
 
What does it take to make an album like this?  Well, a lot.
 
In this case, financial speaking, it takes a lot more than what this campaign goal is asking. In fact, the goal I am asking for is just a very small portion of the total cost of the album and promotion.
 
For those interested in how it works, a budget like this for a mid-level album is very common (often much more)  and the money is typically fronted by a band label, which they have to pay back through album sales and touring.
 
I have decided to take the more challenging path of not signing with a record label and releasing the album under my own label, Cross J Records.  
 
That means I, alone, am responsible for funding my music, making every last detail come together, and promoting it.
 
It is a lot of responsibility.
 
But I have found the reward of doing this with my fans to be far more rewarding than anything I could have imagined.
 
From the time my very first single, Small Town Prison was released, I have had several people send me messages of encouragement, asking me to complete the album so they could hear more of my songs.
 
I love being transparent and want you to know the challenges I face as an independent artist.  I take huge pride in the TOTALLY AMAZING SUPPORT country music fans from all around the world have shown me.  Without you, I could not have gotten so far.  There is nothing in this world like country music fans, you are awesome.
 
The journey on this lonely old road has been long and hard to get to this point, but it has been 100% worth it.  I can’t wait to share the rest of the album with you.  
 
I would be absolutely honored if you decided to partner with me and help with the final completion of this album and It’s release very soon!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<ul><li><strong>This is my second percussion album</strong></li></ul>
<p>I was extremely lucky to have so many backers to support my first album, which resulted in a great deal of inspiring feedback. After 5 years, I decided to produce this 2<sup>nd</sup> album <strong><i>Lambada</i></strong><strong><i>. </i></strong>On this percussion recording, you will hear Piazzolla’s compositions “Oblivion” and “La Muerte Del Angel” on vibes. There are also solo versions of “Over the Rainbow,” “Cavatina,” (from the movie “ The Deer Hunter,”) and Kansas’ famous tune “Dust In the Wind.” In addition, you will also find a challenging and exhilarating piece “Drum Dances” with me on drum set and Irene Yang on piano.</p>

<p>The album covers a lot of sonic ground, there are pieces with solo vibraphone, vibraphone with piano, and drum set with piano.

In addition to learning and playing the music, percussionists have to devote a great deal of time considering how to set up, and how to move the instruments from place to place. If you are interested in gorgeous music, please consider donating to this project.

<p>Hi 大家好</p>
<p>我是打擊樂家—謝家豪。目前在美國加州聖荷西從事演奏和教學的工作。很期待即將發行第二張個人打擊樂演奏專輯。在這張唱片裡，您可以聽到探戈大師的經典樂曲Oblivion、La Muerte De Angel ;獨奏曲目也包括了: Over the Rainbow、選自電影越戰獵鹿人的主題曲Cavatina、選自堪薩斯樂團的Dust in the Wind。這張專輯很榮幸能與充滿熱情且技巧一流的台灣鋼琴家楊欣樺合作錄音；並共同挑戰一首節奏複雜、演奏難度高的爵士鼓與鋼琴二重奏的現代作品Drum Dances。</p>
<p>這張專輯有很多經典的器樂曲，大部分我選擇以鐵琴來詮釋這次的錄音。其中多首音樂旋律雋永、刻劃人心，我相信這些旋律都能經得起時間的考驗，值得愛樂者一聽再聽。</p>
<p>要完成一張打擊樂專輯的背後，需要經過很多籌劃及人力的幫忙。專輯主要的預算有後製、混音、錄音、通路、印刷和場地費用等。如果您對這樣的音樂類型有興趣，歡迎您來贊助這張專輯的製作;如果您喜歡好聽的器樂曲目，更別忘了參考專輯內容並點開相關連結，希望可以跟喜愛打擊樂的朋友們一同分享我的音樂!</p>
<p>謝謝大家觀看這支影片，下次很快再見面!</p>

<h3>Why 1820 The Musical Soundtrack?</h3>
<p>1820 The Musical is a riveting story surrounding the lives of historical religious figures, Joseph and Emma Smith. Through a series of vignettes, it speaks to the human experience of love, loss, faith, trial, sacrifice, injustice, healing, and hope forged in the religious fervor of 19th Century America. The script was written by award-winning playwright, George Nelson, who has had success with plays Off-Broadway and around the world. The sibling songwriting trio, Doug Lowe, Kendra Lowe Holt, &amp; Kayliann Lowe Juarez, has numerous placements in Film/TV and radio singles, including songs on the Billboard Top 10 charts. </p>
<p>The stage production was set to debut earlier this year in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, but has been postponed due to Covid. Many who purchased tickets and are eagerly anticipating a future premiere have requested a soundtrack while they wait. </p>
<p>The creative team heard your request and is pleased to answer your call for an official soundtrack of 1820 The Musical! Do we need your help? Yes!

We have A-list players and award-winning producers involved (including Grammy-nominated) and need YOUR help to raise $50,000 in order to present this soundtrack to you on a sparkling silver platter. (*Note that NONE of these funds raised will go to pay the the songwriters. This campaign will cover hard costs of production expenses and Indiegogo fees ONLY. This is truly a labor of love to get the music into your hands so you don't have to wait a second longer!)</p>

<p>-Digital Download and/or Signed Physical CD Copy of the Soundtrack</p>

<p>By pre-ordering the soundtrack right here on Indiegogo today, you are literally helping answer the call of numerous others requesting to ""get this music out there."" As previously mentioned, the sibling songwriting trio has multiple Film/TV credits, Top 10 Billboard songs on the radio, and decades of experience headlining stage shows internationally.

</div><div>

<p>The creative team brings years of experience recording and creating music projects professionally. Kendra has worked on various celebrity albums and TV shows; Kayliann is a studio session singer in Nashville, with clients including iHeart Radio; Doug is a film producer with endless recording and production credits. As a result, the risks and challenges associated with this soundtrack have mostly been related to moving the project forward in multiple states in America during quarantine, while still adhering to Covid-19 regulations. For example, studio sessions have either been done virtually or with social distancing and mask-wearing. Nashville has carried the bulk of the lead vocals and tracking sessions with live musicians, while Salt Lake City has undertaken the string and ensemble vocal sessions, as well as stellar Grammy-nominated producers who program gorgeous loops, textures, and sounds to make the songs sparkle like ""The Greatest Showman."" We are passionate about this music and have gladly lost sleep and even at times, our sanity, in order to make this soundtrack a reality for you!</p>

<p>Singer, songwriter, rapper, producer, poet, creative, director, actor... I am an all-round entertainer driven by hiphop, inspired by sounds of soul and RnB. I am an MC that rides a beat like a dancehall artist with an English twang at times due to the grime scene I lived in.

<p>I have collaborated and shared the stage with several international artists, producers and songwriters, including Raekwon, 112, J.P. Cooper, Ian Devany (“Been Around the World”, Lisa Stansfield), DJ Mark One, and Cassper Nyovest. I have released singles on labels including InHouse Records (USA), Stoney Boy Music (Sweden), Underrated Individuals Records (Netherlands) and Killertraxx (Italy). My music has charted internationally on the beatport EDM charts, and has been played in over thirty countries worldwide.</p>

<p>Chasing a record deal is not as lucrative as many may think. Really, it's just a big loan and I would lose rights to my music.

<p>I have recorded hundreds of tracks (released and unreleased) and built up quite the catalog working with other musicians, artists, producers and DJ's.

</div></div>","I'm Jerome, a singer-songwriter and rapper from Zimbabwe, and I'm heading into the studio in November to record with an amazing producer. Bringing together hip-hop and African vibes, Mr Arab will be my debut album, after years of releases.
In order for the album to happen there are 3 things that I'd love for you to do right now:
1. Pick your perk (to the right)
2. Contribute  
3. Help spread the word!!
I would greatly appreciate it if YOU could help turn this dream into reality and join me on my journey!

<h2>The Videoclip </h2>
<p>""Es tan natural"" was written as a therapy in a cold winter day by Ronny. He was inspired by the cycles of life, of birth and death and talks about the harmony of the ups and downs of human nature and the importance of a peaceful life respecting the environment.  Our aim is to spread and empower the message of acceptance, love and respect that Ronny wants to communicate to the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Team:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Ronny Sequeira</u> (The Artist) : His artistic career began in his hometown Estelí, Nicaragua, when a group of volunteer U.S. doctors gave him his first guitar at the age of 15. Since then, he has composed songs non-stop. When Ronny was 18 released his first song  ""Amores de juventud"". In 2010, Ronny moved to Germany, where he uses his love for nature in gardening  for a living and invests his free time in pursuing his musical career. He has participated in several cultural events, concerts and festivals. </li>
<li>
<u>Alexandra Yepes</u> (Director &amp; Producer):  In 2007, Alexandra drove by her love for cinema co-founded the Audiovisual Laboratory “Chirimoya Films” in Bogota, Colombia. During her career she has developed several projects as a creative producer, like documentaries, shortfilms and feature films. In 2012 Alexandra has the unique opportunity to be selected by the Berlin Film Festival to participate in the Berlinale Talent Campus. Currently, she is based in Munich, where she continues working for her passion: making audiovisual projects. </li>
<li>
<u>Adriana Dorado</u> (Art Director):  Her passion for nature took her to explore academia through a PhD in biology.  Studying animal communication and their interaction with their environment, she realized that science and art have a lot in common. Inspired by nature and how human perceive it, she started to direct the art of a photography project, which is still ongoing. For now, she is preparing her debut, as art director, in the videoclip of ""Es tan natural"".</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking for resources (5.000 Eur) to fund the Videoclip: Purchase elements of art, rent camera and accessories, rent a Dron &amp;  Post production. Also to finish the mix and mastering of the song. </li>
<li>We have been working for several months on the conceptualization of the video and on some impressive and beautiful animal masks that we are going to use in the Videoclip (in fact those masks will be delivered to our collaborators :))</li>
<li>All the funds that we manage to collect, will be used to finance the videoclip.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>As latin americans living abroad, we are inspired on showing how the mixture of our culture and foreigner cultures influence our aesthetics. We use this opportunity to experiment and show our vision to the world.  </li>
<li>We would like to share with the world Ronny's music, releasing his first video "" Es tan natural"" and contribute to his career development. </li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are excited to show to the public the ideas that we create together. We believe that the release of the first video can be our platform to develop future videoclips and enhance collaborations with more musicians. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>​</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Something you should know...</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ronny, Alexandra and Adriana met in a Ronny's concert. It was like ""creative love at first sight"", that's why they started this project together. </li>
<li>Last fall we started recording a first part of the Videoclip with the masks, now we are motivated to finish it this fall with everyone's help. </li>
<li>Previously we have already worked in a Videoclip for Minga 3 (a Munich band) &amp; for Calle Mambo a video of their presentation at Backstage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>---------</h3>
<h2>El Videoclip </h2>
<p><br/>""Es tan natural"" fue escrito por Ronny como terapia en un día frío de invierno. Se inspira en los ciclos de la vida, del nacimiento y de la muerte y habla de la armonía, de los altibajos de la naturaleza humana y de la importancia de una vida tranquila y respetuosa con el medio ambiente. Nuestro objetivo es difundir y potenciar el mensaje de aceptación, amor y respeto que Ronny quiere comunicar al mundo. </p>

</div></div>","The Videoclip 
""Es tan natural"" was written as a therapy in a cold winter day by Ronny. He was inspired by the cycles of life, of birth and death and talks about the harmony of the ups and downs of human nature and the importance of a peaceful life respecting the environment.  Our aim is to spread and empower the message of acceptance, love and respect that Ronny wants to communicate to the world. 
 
The Team:


Ronny Sequeira (The Artist) : His artistic career began in his hometown Estelí, Nicaragua, when a group of volunteer U.S. doctors gave him his first guitar at the age of 15. Since then, he has composed songs non-stop. When Ronny was 18 released his first song  ""Amores de juventud"". In 2010, Ronny moved to Germany, where he uses his love for nature in gardening  for a living and invests his free time in pursuing his musical career. He has participated in several cultural events, concerts and festivals. 

Alexandra Yepes (Director & Producer):  In 2007, Alexandra drove by her love for cinema co-founded the Audiovisual Laboratory “Chirimoya Films” in Bogota, Colombia. During her career she has developed several projects as a creative producer, like documentaries, shortfilms and feature films. In 2012 Alexandra has the unique opportunity to be selected by the Berlin Film Festival to participate in the Berlinale Talent Campus. Currently, she is based in Munich, where she continues working for her passion: making audiovisual projects. 

Adriana Dorado (Art Director):  Her passion for nature took her to explore academia through a PhD in biology.  Studying animal communication and their interaction with their environment, she realized that science and art have a lot in common. Inspired by nature and how human perceive it, she started to direct the art of a photography project, which is still ongoing. For now, she is preparing her debut, as art director, in the videoclip of ""Es tan natural"".

 

What We Need & What You Get

We are looking for resources (5.000 Eur) to fund the Videoclip: Purchase elements of art, rent camera and accessories, rent a Dron &  Post production. Also to finish the mix and mastering of the song. 
We have been working for several months on the conceptualization of the video and on some impressive and beautiful animal masks that we are going to use in the Videoclip (in fact those masks will be delivered to our collaborators :))
All the funds that we manage to collect, will be used to finance the videoclip.

 

The Impact

As latin americans living abroad, we are inspired on showing how the mixture of our culture and foreigner cultures influence our aesthetics. We use this opportunity to experiment and show our vision to the world.  
We would like to share with the world Ronny's music, releasing his first video "" Es tan natural"" and contribute to his career development. 
We are excited to show to the public the ideas that we create together. We believe that the release of the first video can be our platform to develop future videoclips and enhance collaborations with more musicians. 

​
Something you should know...

Ronny, Alexandra and Adriana met in a Ronny's concert. It was like ""creative love at first sight"", that's why they started this project together. 
Last fall we started recording a first part of the Videoclip with the masks, now we are motivated to finish it this fall with everyone's help. 
Previously we have already worked in a Videoclip for Minga 3 (a Munich band) & for Calle Mambo a video of their presentation at Backstage.

---------
El Videoclip 
""Es tan natural"" fue escrito por Ronny como terapia en un día frío de invierno. Se inspira en los ciclos de la vida, del nacimiento y de la muerte y habla de la armonía, de los altibajos de la naturaleza humana y de la importancia de una vida tranquila y respetuosa con el medio ambiente. Nuestro objetivo es difundir y potenciar el mensaje de aceptación, amor y respeto que Ronny quiere comunicar al mundo.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello My name is Michael Crane I am a well published writer based in Melbourne.
A friend of mine once said to me ""Michael you're a punk, because punks do it for themselves, organise things and don't wait to be asked"".
Since 1991 I have been
organising music and Poetry events including Poetry Slams, Art
Auctions, Musical cabarets and Tributes to Leonard Cohen and Charles Bukowski.


I  have presented events in some of Melbourne's best venues including The Continental Cafe,The Universal Theatre, The Lounge, The Prince of Wales, The St Kilda Library ( and seven other libraries for the
Poetry Idol series), The Malthouse Theatre and St Kilda's iconic Esplanade Hotel.
My events have been included in some major festivals including The Melbourne Writers Festival, the St Kilda Festival, The
Darebin Music Feast and the Williamston Literary Festival.
I also published the Literary annual Journal, the Paradise
Anthology which in seven issues published and paid more than 200 poets
and musicians.
Although I have been able to get some funding for these
projects I've never been able to get funding for my own writing. I have a great friend Lazarus from Trojan Press who printed
200 copies of my latest book, The Church of Contradictions which
featured 135 prose poems and it has been recently reviewed in the
Sydney
Morning Herald.
To see the review go to
michaelcranemelbournewriter.blogspot.com
Lazarus printed my book on credit  and I am seeking funds to pay him back.
What We Need & What You Get
 I am seeking $1500 to put towards two things;
1. To pay Lazarus back for the printing costs ($1,200). 
2. To pay performers to play at a special function on Saturday the 10th October 5pm to 7pm at Robarta Nightclub- 107-109 Fitzroy Street St Kilda to re-launch the book ($300).
Australian music legend, Chris Wilson will be performing at the launch function. 
At the function there will also be free finger food supplied by the venue.
As you'll see in the perks section,  for a minimum $25 if you come to the function you will receive a signed copy of my book: The Church of Contradictions.
if you cant come along to the function on 10th October, please pledge anyway and I'll make sure to send you a signed copy of the book.
Risks & Challenges
 If I am only able to raise part of the funds, I will pay the performers and some part towards the printing costs.

<h3>LB the Poet - Transitions</h3>
<p>When was the last time you went through one?</p>
<p>Who helped you through some of the hardest transitions of your life?</p>
<p>When we start adding up how many times we have faced a transition, there’s plenty to recall. On the most basic level, we go through a transition every morning when we wake up -- each new day presents its successes and struggles. Even bigger than that are the life transitions we experience.</p>
<p>My transitions into marriage, parenthood, business, and activism have turned me into an artist, a poet, a mentor, and an educator. Throughout it all, I’ve looked to the freedom of writing as an outlet to share my successes and struggles. Throughout it all, I’ve learned that every day includes a win -- there may be setbacks and struggles, but there’s no such thing as a loss.</p>
<p>I’ve been through all of these transitions; both the daily rebirth and the huge life changes that impact me but also those around me. I know that I’m not alone and there are entire communities who have walked the same path or will soon encounter these transitions.</p>
<p>Join me on my newest journey to help spread the Word of Mouth I know we all need. This album is a culmination of years of exploration and transitions, and ultimately the goal in producing this art is to send the message far and wide that every day needs to be a “wins”-day.</p>
<p>I want to share my experience to let others know that they aren’t alone despite facing difficult, life-changing transitions. Just like I found my power through writing, I want everyone to know they can find their power too. My newest project speaks to just that. This album combines my love for poetry, music, and community collaboration. Regardless of which corner of the world you call your own, we can all foster positive affirmation through music that speaks to universal struggles, successes, and transitions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5000 to complete the album, create artistic visuals, and produce the physical merchandise that we are offering to you in this campaign. Here's a breakdown of where the contributions will be going and what is being offered in return.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost to create, package, and ship the product ($1500)</li>
<li>Mixing and Mastering the album ($750)</li>
<li>Studio time ($250)</li>
<li>Filming and editing of music videos ($1250)</li>
<li>Marketing budget ($1000)</li>
<li>Indiegogo Fee ($250)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are some fortunate students in our city of Winston-Salem, NC that see and learn from LB the Poet on a regular basis. This fall LB is conducting poetry workshops in two Elementary Schools, two High Schools, and on a college campus. This album is for these students. This album is for all of the youth in our community and beyond that may not have the same luxury to be touched by the positivity, the direction, and the empowerment that LB provides to his students in the classroom. LB is packaging Positive Affirmations and Feel Good Music into this piece of artwork and offering it to the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>LB is known as a poet. LB is known for his energy on stage as an award-winning host. LB is known for his community involvement. LB is known for educating the youth and showing them a purpose-driven life.</p>
<p>You may not yet know LB as a musician and that may give some pause for backing this campaign. We completely understand where there may be hesitations. We are aware that there is a small taste of LB's musical talent. We will continue to provide you more of the sound and we are confident that LB is creating a masterpiece. If you know LB, then you likely already know that this is more than just music. This is a movement and we need you to be involved. If you are getting to know LB, we are grateful that you found this project and hope that you'll be a part of this Transition</p>

<h3>About me and this album:</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As many of you know, I'm a singer-songwriter from Western Massachusetts. Lately I use the term ""alt-folk"" to describe my stuff. Expect intricate guitars, delicate melodies, and lush lyrical images. Maybe earworms. Over the 20+ years I've been writing songs I've refined my craft, expanded my palette, lived in the world, and grown as a songwriter.</span></p>

<p>I've got a day-job. But music and art making is my first love. A wise friend recently told me ""my job keeps me afloat, but it's the art that lets me fly."" It's tough to be an independent musician these days. Everybody's got music streaming into their earbuds for $10/month and folks like me only see a few cents for it. By supporting and buying my music you're making a statement that you care about independent music and art; bringing a little love and light to the world to help us fly. </p>

If you'd like a perk that is for a different amount than your donation (for example giving $50, but want the $25 perk), please just click ""BACK IT"" at the top, enter the amount you'd like to donate, and send me a note to let me know which perk you'd like.  
​If you live locally and want to receive your perk in person instead of paying for shipping, please just click ""BACK IT"" at the top, enter your amount you'd like to donate, and send me a note to let me know which perk you'd like. I have plenty and I'll get it to you!

 
10/9 Update: Full preview of the title song ""Beggar's Disguise""!


 

About me and this album:
As many of you know, I'm a singer-songwriter from Western Massachusetts. Lately I use the term ""alt-folk"" to describe my stuff. Expect intricate guitars, delicate melodies, and lush lyrical images. Maybe earworms. Over the 20+ years I've been writing songs I've refined my craft, expanded my palette, lived in the world, and grown as a songwriter.
""Let in the Light"" is my third full-length album and certainly my best yet. It's been nearly 5 years since my last release. In that time I have written, re-written, recorded, arranged, overdubbed and winnowed down the songs to these ten. I'm fortunate to have worked with several talented session musicians who contributed percussion, piano, violin, cello, pedal steel guitar, and accordion to these recordings.  I'm an incredibly proud father of this music. 
Tracklist: 

Let in the Light 
How Far We've Come
Marrow and Bone
Dandelion Seeds
Beggar's Disguise
Nautilus
Three Little Birds
Ones That I Love
Immaculate Flowers
Lost and Found

We care deeply about lots of stuff and know how to be serious, but we also believe that having fun is a <u>really</u> big deal.  We met while performing musical improv out of hole-in-the-wall comedy clubs in Ventura, CA, and decided to join forces with this goal in mind: <i>help the most people have the most fun. </i></p>

<p>Real talk.

We will record many of the songs that we been associated with in Knoxville.When the lunch counter from the Greensboro sit-in started the Smithsonian tour at the Beck Center, we wrote and played our original song, ""Answer the Call"". We were invited to create a jingle for WBIR called 'Knoxville My Hometown"". As a cast member of Carpetbag Theatre's BETWEEN A BALLAD AND A BLUES, we popularized Ida Cox's ""Wild Women Don't Have the Blues"". Will and I want to take songs like these that have shaped our lives together and record them on one album. If we're just meeting us for the first time, here's a little bit about us...Vocalist

Born and raised in Springfield, IL and then spending my late teens and early twenties in Chicago I was in the middle of everything; Love, Heartbreak and Music. Wanting more than what I had, I realized Chicago wasn't enough. I then decided to make my way to LA to pursue a music career. Illinois to California is a big jump and I thought I was ready, but I lived too far in the past I did not know how to advance in my life. I often thought of passed success, old relationships and the fear of missing out. I thought about this so much and it withheld me from happiness.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>After two years of living out here in sunny California and finally looking in to my situation, I decided to break those chains that held me took advantage of new opportunities. I began to break away from those things that held me down and put them into song and I hope soon they bring an understanding to you as well. So please allow me and yourself by contributing to this Music Project.</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FIQviNEexV7E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIQviNEexV7E&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FIQviNEexV7E%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div> <p></p><p></p><p><b><i>What is ""CASHMERE SWEATERS""?</i></b></p><p>Throughout my life I have found things to hold on to, but as time went on I found myself holding on to the past.

This album talks about things we all deal with; strengths, weaknesses, dreams, and everything else involved in love. Strength is positive, Weakness sinks, Dreams change and Love is wanted. The content of this album is pulled from the center of my heart and is displayed through the smooth sounds of Pop, R&amp;B and Soul.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Where Did This All Start?</h2><p>To answer that, I need to tell you what happened driving around Nashville, TN nearly 10 years ago. You know when you just know that your time is up somewhere? I hadn't been praying, fasting, or the doing the super spiritual things one should do at a season change, but my apartment lease was up. I remember saying out loud, ""God, what do you want me to do?"" and as if He was sitting in that car, I heard Him say, ""What do YOU want to do?"" I was like...Is that a legal question??? Hahahaha! Out of my mouth came, ""I want to go to New York to finish my vocal training!"" and He said GO!!!! I had no earthly idea that NYC would immediately capture my heart and become the soil of my destiny.</p><p>Something happened to me walking the streets of NYC with absolutely no plan B. God was always talking, and I learned to listen with intentionality at the most inconvenient times and places.  A friend and I began having nights of worship, random people began to come, and I fell in love with my living room. I found myself surrounded by amazing New Yorkers from different churches and backgrounds, and God exploded His love on all us. For years, all He would let us do is learn how to receive His love, and that became my forever core message and agenda.</p><p>Can you believe thousands of people have come through that tiny apartment to worship and love each other well? From there my heart began to expand with a deep desire for people all over the world to see their identity wrapped up in His. Seek Church was birthed in that room and many of these songs came out of spontaneous times of worship and ministry with my heroes.</p><h2>What is it about these songs????</h2><p>Everything changes for a writer, performer, minister, and even a friend, when you fall in love with the one right in front of you. When my number one goal in life became to be the best receiver of God's love that I had ever met, I learned how to love. Compassion took over and became the love motivation for the ear at the other end of my voice.</p><h3>Create With Me</h3><p>After years of crafting songs as a published songwriter, I found myself sitting at the piano and singing new songs as if I had known it forever. One of my favorite moments was hearing the invitation to “create with Him” and knowing it was a game changer.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Create with me all you sons and you daughters. </i></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Embrace a life of new songs and new colors.</i></p><p>I got completely freaked out as I sang these words and felt His Presence all over me. Then in the midst of the excitement of creativity, He wrecked me as I so clearly heard the next words…</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>You're not orphans anymore</i></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>You're not beggars you never were</i></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>I have always seen you free</i></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>So common create with me</i></p><p>I lost it at that point as His reality absorbed into my own. A few days later, while in a NYC cab holding on for dear life, I heard God ask, ""What is your response?"" I knew He was talking about this song!!! Immediately I said ""<i>Thank you, for seeing me like You do</i>...” and the rest of the song came.</p><h3>Every Song Is An Experience</h3><p>Every song on this album is about our identity in Him. He doesn't beat around the bush in His extravagant love for us, and His obvious desire is that we live here on earth like the sons and daughters of the Creator we are. I believe that every song will result in an experience that changes everything for the listener.</p><h2>What do I need from you????</h2><p>I need your help to fund this album. This is an enormous undertaking, and requires more than just me. The producers, musicians, and singers that are part of this project are the best of the best and bring their own unique color and texture to the sound. Beyond the fact that it will cost around $30,000 to complete, it is so important to me that you are also a part of this is a team effort.</p><h3>What I Need Funding For</h3><ul>

You know when you just know that your time is up somewhere? I hadn't been praying, fasting, or the doing the super spiritual things one should do at a season change, but my apartment lease was up. I remember saying out loud, ""God, what do you want me to do?"" and as if He was sitting in that car, I heard Him say, ""What do YOU want to do?"" I was like...Is that a legal question??? Hahahaha! Out of my mouth came, ""I want to go to New York to finish my vocal training!"" and He said GO!!!! I had no earthly idea that NYC would immediately capture my heart and become the soil of my destiny.Something happened to me walking the streets of NYC with absolutely no plan B. God was always talking, and I learned to listen with intentionality at the most inconvenient times and places.  A friend and I began having nights of worship, random people began to come, and I fell in love with my living room. I found myself surrounded by amazing New Yorkers from different churches and backgrounds, and God exploded His love on all us. For years, all He would let us do is learn how to receive His love, and that became my forever core message and agenda.Can you believe thousands of people have come through that tiny apartment to worship and love each other well? From there my heart began to expand with a deep desire for people all over the world to see their identity wrapped up in His. Seek Church was birthed in that room and many of these songs came out of spontaneous times of worship and ministry with my heroes.What is it about these songs????Everything changes for a writer, performer, minister, and even a friend, when you fall in love with the one right in front of you. When my number one goal in life became to be the best receiver of God's love that I had ever met, I learned how to love. Compassion took over and became the love motivation for the ear at the other end of my voice.Create With MeAfter years of crafting songs as a published songwriter, I found myself sitting at the piano and singing new songs as if I had known it forever. One of my favorite moments was hearing the invitation to “create with Him” and knowing it was a game changer.Create with me all you sons and you daughters. Embrace a life of new songs and new colors.I got completely freaked out as I sang these words and felt His Presence all over me. Then in the midst of the excitement of creativity, He wrecked me as I so clearly heard the next words…You're not orphans anymoreYou're not beggars you never wereI have always seen you freeSo common create with meI lost it at that point as His reality absorbed into my own. A few days later, while in a NYC cab holding on for dear life, I heard God ask, ""What is your response?"" I knew He was talking about this song!!! Immediately I said ""Thank you, for seeing me like You do...” and the rest of the song came.Every Song Is An ExperienceEvery song on this album is about our identity in Him. He doesn't beat around the bush in His extravagant love for us, and His obvious desire is that we live here on earth like the sons and daughters of the Creator we are. I believe that every song will result in an experience that changes everything for the listener.What do I need from you????I need your help to fund this album. This is an enormous undertaking, and requires more than just me. The producers, musicians, and singers that are part of this project are the best of the best and bring their own unique color and texture to the sound. Beyond the fact that it will cost around $30,000 to complete, it is so important to me that you are also a part of this is a team effort.What I Need Funding For
Studio fees
Contracting Musicians
Hiring Producers 
Rehearsal space
Publishing
Engineers
Marketing and PR
Art work and album design
CD Manufacturing & Duplication
Administrative work
If I don't raise enoughWe will use whatever funds we receive to begin recording the album and search for other ways to complete the funding and finish the project. If I raise more than I needAny and all additional funds raised will be used for future projects that are already in the works.Other ways you can helpI understand not everyone is able to contribute financially, so here's how you can still help:
Please help me promote this campaign on your Facebook and other social media pages.
Spread the word about the album when it is released.
Pray for us as we record. We are going after a new sound that translates His heart through music and sound to the studio, and right into the atmosphere of the listener.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Samuel Foucher, I am a 19-year old student, musician, technologist, martial artist, and soon-to-be wilderness adventurer. Music has been an important part of my life since I started playing accordion when I was 12. By releasing this CD, I am raising funds for a transformative journey with Kroka Expeditions. The expedition is a 5-month trek through Vermont and Canada, travelling by ski in the winter, and canoe, rowboat, and bicycle after the snow melts. Along the way I will be studying academics with the small group of students, and there will be many opportunities for growing and expanding myself. Although I will be leaving my accordion behind (It’s too heavy for backpacking on skis!), I am incorporating my love of music into this trip by creating a CD. I have recorded 6 tracks of my solo accordion playing, and several live tracks featuring some of my talented friends. The music I play comes from the celtic tradition of Ireland, and its descendants in New England and Canada. The CD will be available shortly after I return in mid-June.</p>
<p>In the past few months I have been getting the gear I need, dehydrating food for the trail, and working on my physical fitness. A remaining challenge is the cost of the program, in tuition and equipment. So far, I have raised more than two-thirds through a variety of ways: Working from the spring through December, contributions from my parents and other family members, scholarships, and a concert I put on with sibling duo Liz and Dan Faiella. I need to raise another $3,000 to complete the cost of the program by the time I return. I am offering these items as thank-you gifts:</p>
<p>$20, I will ship you one of my CDs.</p>
<p>$50, I will send you 3 CDs, and a note of reflection with a few stories from my expedition.</p>
<p>$150, I will send you 5 CDs, a note of reflection, and a wooden spoon I will make by hand. I will be learning to make these out of found pieces of wood along the trail during the expedition!</p>
<p><br/>Even if I do not reach my goal of $3,000, contributions will go towards my trip, and I will be sending the CDs and other items to anyone who orders them.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>The Impact</h3></div><div>
<p>In going on this expedition, I am excited to see more of the world and the wilderness. I can’t wait to experience the bracing cold, deep snow, forest, mountains, rivers, and lakes! I hope to come home a better person in so many ways, with skills and motivation to live my mission in the world. I want to live in a world where people live in strong communities, and humans are stewards of the earth. I want to be this change that I would like to see. At this time in my life, I am focused on learning and overcoming my own obstacles so that I am more capable of living this mission. Physical stamina, social skills, connection to nature, and courage are important to me. I seek to develop these by going on this semester. It will push my body and increase my strength, give me a chance to live in a tightly knit community, allow me to experience nature intensely, and help me face fear. It will teach me how to live lightly on the earth. I believe I will come home from this adventure an empowered and stronger person.</p>
<p>I am also excited to begin sharing my music with the world! I grew up and live in Harrisville, NH, where I was homeschooled for my entire childhood through high school. This educational experience, the area I lived in, and the local community inspired in me a deep seated interest in learning and nature. I enjoyed the flexibility of homeschooling and it allowed me to explore many things in the community I grew up in. I became involved in music, martial arts, technology, and many other activities with local people. One of the highlights was attending contra dances almost every week. I gradually got involved with the community and the musicians who created a wonderful open band for the Nelson, NH dance. I started spending more time on stage playing for the dance, attending music camps, and studying with local masters such as the late celebrated contra dance pianist Bob McQuillen. I played my first full-length gig with a band of friends a little more than a year ago. Most recently, I played with Liz and Dan Faiella for my fundraising concert on January 8th which brought together over 70 people from the local community! The CD will include a few live tracks recorded at this concert. It is my first recording, and I am excited for you to hear it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am producing this CD myself, and the raw recordings are done. All that remains is for me to do the mastering and order the copies. Ordering the CDs after this fundraiser will allow me to know exactly how many I need. I have identified the source for the copies, and I am aware of all associated costs.</p>
<p>I anticipate little challenge since a large part of the process is complete, other than the exciting risks and challenges of my adventure at Kroka! I return from my trip in mid-June, and I plan on shipping the CDs by mid-July. This leaves some buffer time in case I discover an issue. If all goes well, I will ship them sooner.</p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>We are four Beatle-lovin' lads on Oahu, Hawaii who have re-created the idea of a Beatles tribute band. Such bands all look the same (for obvious reasons!), sound the same and certainly do their part in spreading Beatle love. Nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>However, Beatle-Lele Mania! has taken the music of greatest band ever and transposed those songs through Hawaii's favorite instrument, the ukulele, an instrument with continuing global popularity and still featuring each band member performing and singing their respective ""Beatle parts"". With a cajon for added percussion, hearing these songs in this way is a truly unique, island-style experience.</p>
<p>We want to share this one-of-a-kind experience with you- and the world, and are preparing to record our debut album later this spring. We humbly ask for your help to have us reach our goal to bring this project to reality. In doing so, we'll provide you with fantastic incentives and perks listed on the right side of this page. With this collaboration, we will be able to provide this Hawaiian-style version of the Beatles music to the rest of the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to reach or exceed a stated goal of $12,000. As outlined in our intro video above, reaching this goal will help to offset our costs which include recording/mixing/mastering our debut album, album press design and artwork, video production/editing, marketing/advertising, costs of incentives being offered and the fee's associated with this campaign. We've also had a little help from our friends and they get a little tired of working for free after awhile.</p>
<p>Paul McCartney said, ""...and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make"". In return for your ""Beatle love"", we will provide you with digital downloads and autographed copies of our debut ""Beatle-Lele Mania!"" album before anyone else this summer. You can also receive limited edition ""Beatle-Lele Mania!"" T-shirts, band photo, special recognition on our ""Mahalo"" page of our website, opportunities to play at your private party/event and even solid koa ukulele's and VIP access to our CD Release Party later this summer in Honolulu. Heck, we'll even let you co-star in one of our upcoming video's! We appreciate your faith and love in our project and even if we don't hit our goal of $12,000, we intend to make good on all the incentives for those that make a contribution. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To insure we put out the best album possible, we have enlisted the ""A-list"" of ""A-list"" producers in Hawaii; none other than Dave Tucciarone, himself. For the past couple decades, Dave has produced/engineered a who's who of Hawaiian music and has his name attributed to 300 albums, 13 Na Hoku Hano Hano Awards, including recent Grammy Award Hawaiian artist, Kalani Pe'a.</p>
<p>Like the members of Beatle-Lele Mania!, Dave is an avid fan of The Beatles and knows how important the accuracy of ""getting it right"" is to our group. You can be assured, he is the right man for the job!</p>
<p>To our knowledge, there is no other Beatles tribute group in the world performing the music of The Beatles as we are on ukulele's with cajon. With the world's love of Hawaii, the ukulele and the music of The Beatles, we believe this beautiful combination will be a positive impact upon those who hear it. In the end, we hope to foster and be ambassador's of peace and aloha to the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We respect if you are not in a position to help fund this Indiegogo campaign. That is totally ok! What you can do...</p>
<p>1. Sharing is Caring! What we ask that you do is use the Indiegogo SHARE TOOL and spread this campaign of love with others. Start with those executives you know who work at Google or Microsoft, or any recipient of funds for Honolulu's Rail project or your boss, your employer, your rich auntie...you get the idea!</p>
<p>2. And very importantly, please keep us and this project in your prayers. We are giving it our all and have no idea where this will go. But at least we'll be able to look back on this bucket list item and say, ""we gave it our all, boys!"" With your help, and the good Lord above, we are confident our music will come to fruition.</p>
<p>Wherever this magical mystery tour takes us on this long and winding road, we will submit to. We are grateful to you for taking the time to consider funding this recording endeavor and pray for you in return that you receive an abundance of Beatle blessings!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are four Beatle-lovin' lads on Oahu, Hawaii who have re-created the idea of a Beatles tribute band. Such bands all look the same (for obvious reasons!), sound the same and certainly do their part in spreading Beatle love. Nothing wrong with that.
However, Beatle-Lele Mania! has taken the music of greatest band ever and transposed those songs through Hawaii's favorite instrument, the ukulele, an instrument with continuing global popularity and still featuring each band member performing and singing their respective ""Beatle parts"". With a cajon for added percussion, hearing these songs in this way is a truly unique, island-style experience.
We want to share this one-of-a-kind experience with you- and the world, and are preparing to record our debut album later this spring. We humbly ask for your help to have us reach our goal to bring this project to reality. In doing so, we'll provide you with fantastic incentives and perks listed on the right side of this page. With this collaboration, we will be able to provide this Hawaiian-style version of the Beatles music to the rest of the world.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is (Matt)hew Almodiel and I'm a singer/songwriter based in Los Angeles. Originally from the Washington, D.C area, I moved to LA for that one dream - music. But for me, my dream isn't just a dream, it's a lifestyle, a movement, a gathering, a language, something that defines me, my whole character. Growing up, music played a huge factor in my childhood. I was always told that singing was frowned upon, in which if a man were to sing, they’d be considered “gay”. Bullied in middle and high school for the simple fact of being a singer, I must admit that I did turn away from it all. But I always found myself singing in church, or used some kind of outlet music related. I got accustomed to my own well being knowing that it’s a “part of me”. And I couldn’t change that. To this day, that’s something that I can proudly say that I’m glad I didn’t.</p>
<p>Here I am as a 23-year-old singer/songwriter, a victim of bullying, of being ridiculed for being openly gay, of racism, and of body shaming in the (music) industry. I stand proudly to say that I’m a confident survivor. And will constantly yearn to be the voice of those who feel as if they’ve gone through, or currently going through any hardships in their life. I’m a regular person, with a huge voice, and a dream to follow. That dream isn’t just the music; it’s for everyone to have self-confidence and acceptance within themselves. This EP is not just for me, it’s for all of those who feel they can’t speak for themselves. I’m a geek. I’m a nerd. We’re in this together.</p>

<h3>What is ""We're All Awkward""?</h3>
<p>“We’re All Awkward” will be my comeback EP after four years but more or less, my debut EP. I’m putting so much heart and soul into this project. It’ll be a five song “pop and funk inspired” EP with influences from Shawn Mendes to Sam Smith. Each song was handwritten from personal experiences in my life and it’s about time to bring them to life.</p>
<p>The title is inspired by my lifestyle. I’m a regular human being with awkward tendencies, and proud of that. I’m not the only one either. The term “awkward” symbolizes our differences. And deeply, it’s something we all have in common, just like being awkward. “We’re all awkward”.</p>
<p>I’m using this project to showcase the improvement in my artistry. I haven’t released anything professionally in about over four years and I have a lot to show, a lot to prove, and a hell of a lot to say. But I cannot do this alone. My one wish is for you to seek hope and believe in the work that I do and the reasons behind it. One of my goals is to be an acknowledged openly Gay Asian American Man (with an image Hollywood doesn’t approve of normally) to win a Grammy, to prove that if someone with so many differences as myself can do it, others can do it too.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Where Is It Going?</h3>
<p>I'm crowdfunding an approximate 7,000 dollars to finally get this product tangible. This is what we need to get this voice out and how it will be broken down.</p>

<p>Look to the side where the perks are at. I promise you, it'll be something worth going over. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking your time into reading over how immensely awkward I am. I cannot express enough how close I am to putting our dreams into a tangible project. Cannot wait to express our voices together. This isn't my project, it's ours. And I can't wait to share our voices!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Teraj and I'm an R&amp;B/Pop singer and performer with stories and a voice that I'd love to share with the world. My debut album will be an amazing body of work that chronicles a few chapters in my life: love, loss, struggle, and triumph. It'll be a celebration of humanity in all its splendor and hardship, and will have a range moments that provoke thought, leaving listeners inspired and uplifted.</p>
<p>None of this will be possible without the support of those who believe in my project, and the successful funding of this campaign, and that's where I need your help. The proceeds of this campaign will go toward the creation of a polished, top-notch, and an immaculately conceived debut EP comprised of 6-8 songs, and I promise to deliver incredible music and vocals.</p>
<p>Reaching the goal of this campaign will allow me to collaborate with music producers and other talented songwriters to bring an extraordinary album to life. Music and performing are my ultimate passions, and have been a dream of mine since a child. I've been performing on stage since high school, was a part of an awesome a cappella group, The Class Notes, at Cornell University and released promotional singles a few years back and put on shows in New York City. Fast forward to today, as a model and real estate agent, I long for the opportunity to sing and make music again. Everyday, I wake up with melodies, lyrics, and sometimes complete songs from my dreams. The majority of one of my previous songs <i>Fallin' for You</i> came about this way. The lyrics, the melody, all the way to the background harmonies, all came to me in a dream and there are so many other songs that came from the same process. I'm certain that it is the universe telling me, daily, that I was born to make music and perform.</p>
<p>What I've learned over the last few years is that launching a successful music career is one venture I cannot do on my own. I welcome all of the support that I can receive to launch my debut album and ultimately begin the journey of fulfilling my dream as a singer, songwriter and performer.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've seen artists successfully use this platform to release albums, music videos, and ultimately launch careers worth having. I'd also like to show where every penny is going that is raised from this campaign, showing a high-quality record comes at a price. If the goal is exceeded, I may be able to do things I have only dreamt about. Regardless of the closing total, I will work hard to deliver an amazing album accompanied by stunning visuals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By joining me on this journey, you yourself are taking charge and helping to change how music is made. Your contributions, support and faith in this project will imbue even more passion in the writing process, recording sessions, delivery of the final product, and stage performances. </p>
<p>I give you my word that I will not settle for ""good enough"" and above all, the money raised will be reflected in the quality of the album.</p>
<p>Here's to making a collection of my best songs yet, I will not let you down.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't know what to think about this project and aren't sure if you can commit, there are other ways you can help out. Spread the word! Tell your family and friends and let them know what's going on, it would help immensely. With social media and all of the many ways we now connect with one another, by posting links to this page you are reaching audiences and places I would never be able to reach.</p>

Everyday, I wake up with melodies, lyrics, and sometimes complete songs from my dreams. The majority of one of my previous songs Fallin' for You came about this way. The lyrics, the melody, all the way to the background harmonies, all came to me in a dream and there are so many other songs that came from the same process. I'm certain that it is the universe telling me, daily, that I was born to make music and perform.
What I've learned over the last few years is that launching a successful music career is one venture I cannot do on my own. I welcome all of the support that I can receive to launch my debut album and ultimately begin the journey of fulfilling my dream as a singer, songwriter and performer.
 

What We Need & What You Get
I've seen artists successfully use this platform to release albums, music videos, and ultimately launch careers worth having. I'd also like to show where every penny is going that is raised from this campaign, showing a high-quality record comes at a price. If the goal is exceeded, I may be able to do things I have only dreamt about. Regardless of the closing total, I will work hard to deliver an amazing album accompanied by stunning visuals.

 
The Impact
By joining me on this journey, you yourself are taking charge and helping to change how music is made. Your contributions, support and faith in this project will imbue even more passion in the writing process, recording sessions, delivery of the final product, and stage performances. 
I give you my word that I will not settle for ""good enough"" and above all, the money raised will be reflected in the quality of the album.
Here's to making a collection of my best songs yet, I will not let you down.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't know what to think about this project and aren't sure if you can commit, there are other ways you can help out. Spread the word! Tell your family and friends and let them know what's going on, it would help immensely. With social media and all of the many ways we now connect with one another, by posting links to this page you are reaching audiences and places I would never be able to reach.

<p>Our band has been writing songs and playing shows up and down the west coast for over three years. During this time we've accumulated over 40+ fully recorded demos, released an EP and will be featured as one of the top prospects in the 2016 years end issue of Music Connection magazine. With the money we've saved and a little help from our friends at The Greenlit Collective, we entered The Panda Studios with Producer Sam Pura (The Story So Far, State Champs, Basement) to record our debut album. On November 1st, we started the 35 day process to narrow down and shape years of material into the 10 best songs that will make our record. It has been an exciting, humbling and sometimes tense few weeks here in the studio but the vibes are on point and the atmosphere is everything we needed to put out the best music. We have a few more weeks left at Panda, but we'll need your support getting to the finish line and releasing the album without a label. Our remaining costs will include studio time (mixing, mastering) &amp; physical distribution.</p>
<p>We're going to offer quite a few perks to those who contribute to our campaign, including all the Pre Production Demos as well as our previous works and digital lyric zines. We'll also be printing limited edition merch and producing an episodic video series while we are here at the studio.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hello! My name is Shasta Hunt.</strong></p>
<p>I’m a Singer/Song writer from West Plains, MO. This project is the culmination of countless hours spent finding inspiration, creating original songs and researching the best way to put everything collectively together.  <strong>I am, for the first time in my life, feeling brave enough to offer my music up to my city and my community as part of that <i>bigger picture.</i> </strong></p>
<p>Those closest to me are aware of how I have always been involved with music and how much I love to sing.  My greatest hearts desire is to express myself intimately and honestly through my voice. It's a powerful tool and I plan to use it to bless others. Recently and through the years , I’ve created many original songs that I've finally come realized are worth sharing, thanks to the unyielding support and amazing encouragement of my family, friends, and producer, Randy Bowen. </p>
<p> I have truly been waited my whole life for this.  I've worked SO HARD and come so far! Now, with  <strong>YOUR</strong> generosity, this <strong>Indiegogo</strong> campaign is the final step I need to take, and your support <strong>WILL</strong> help in making this album real.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487726463/mmrg9ifuisec52uyl0nj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484627002/o0owjqvwtqijcptpsqm0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I grew up singing in Church. I have always had this deep deep passion for singing.  I can remember as a five year old creating songs and sharing them so proudly to my mother and other loved ones. Although a little shy, all that fear went away as soon as I began to sing. It brought me peace and freedom and I soon learned I brought this to others too. My music roots center around a variety of artist and genres.  Some of my favorites were; Sandi Patti, Steven Curtis Chapman, Carmen, Kirk Franklin and DC Talk to name only a few.</p>
<p>         My renewed hope with this <strong>EP</strong> is to create the songs <i><strong>that God will use to touch peoples hearts and open the doors needed to make this my profession. </strong></i> I love hearing stories from fans after events about how a song I sang spoke to them and strengthened them through a hard time. This is what really lead me to take my music further; This and the fact that a song always lays on my lips &amp; is continuously playing in my soul. I am never not singing a tune or humming a melody.</p>
<p><u><strong>Everything has now led up to this moment right now, a walk into my solo career and I'm eager to record my first full length album.</strong></u></p>

<p>This campaign is raising funds for my first professionally recorded album here in Missouri with Randy Bowen, a producer and engineer with 30+ years of experience.  Together, Randy and I are writing original material, unique musical arrangements, and nurturing creative ideas to bring my songs to life<i><strong> in a way that wouldn’t be possible without your help!</strong></i></p>

<p>          <strong> <u> The Idea of Crowdfunding provides a platform for ME to include YOU!!!!</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I have friends, family &amp; fans all over this big amazing world we live in, &amp; with Crowdfunding I can connect with everyone &amp; anyone that has been touched by my music, allowing me to invite them to be a part of the music making process, no matter how far the distance between us.</p>

<p><strong><i>To create an EP  of this quality and involvement, studio time and producing costs add up quickly.  With that said, this campaign gives us a necessary and unique opportunity to collaborate to make great, professionally handled art together.  Your donation will cover the following costs of my project:</i></strong></p>
<p><u><strong>1. Pre-Production:</strong> </u>This is where everything starts.  Randy and I sit down, taking original song ideas and starting to craft the arrangements for each of these songs that will eventually go on the album.  Here, we take the time to create a rough sketch of each song, mapping out structure, which helps me, Randy, and I envision our goals for each song before we start recording.  This ensures maximum use of studio time and a better understanding of the goals of each piece before recording.</p>
<p><u><strong>2. Recording:</strong> </u>This is when I enter the studio and start capturing the music and where the songs become what you'll hear on this album.  Here, we can also add instruments I don’t currently play myself but that will take my arrangements to the next level, like drums, bass, electric guitar and any other instrument that will add the perfect texture and balance to these songs.</p>
<p><strong><u>3. Mixing &amp; Mastering:</u> </strong>Each track will get mixed to create the right balance between instruments, texture and color that make up a track.  As a final step, the album will be tediously mastered from beginning to end, so the listening experience is cohesive and carefully choreographed from start to finish.  Like editing a book, it is making sure every phrase and note is placed perfectly. </p>
<p>Randy Bowen &amp; I will continue to collaborate in the composition of lyrics to song, music mixing and vocal tracking as we have with our 1st masterpiece ""Magnify"".  We are super excited to be working together.  We have a strong dynamic that really fosters creative energy and parallel spiritual backings.  We will be doing some live to tape recording and other editing.  The mastering of the album will be done at the exceptional hand of Randy.</p>

Thank you so much if you have read all this and for taking the time to consider everything this campaign is truly about.
With Sincerest Love,

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We're Callow - a male/female duo, based in the San Francisco Bay area. Our music is dark, cathartic, and raw, because it comes from a deeply emotional place. (We call it ""dream/doom"" - thanks to a musical friend and fan in Coeur d'Alene who described us that way a few years ago. We love our fans! You guys rule.)</p>
<p>We've been writing music and touring since 2009. In the beginning we were really fueled by the economic crash, and what happened to us in its wake.</p>
<p>We took a break from touring for the last couple of years, in order to get our lives back together, and during that time we've been writing the music that has become our third album, Mothdust. (Why ""Mothdust""? For one thing, our practice space is a moth-haven. Moths are very curious night creatures - much less appreciated than their colorful daytime counterpart, butterflies, and yet so beautiful in their own way. We had long been enamored with night creatures, and had even talked about writing a concept album based on them. so when they showed up at our practice space, it was as if they'd heard our talking, and came to be our muses.) .</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for $5000</p>
<ul>
<li>$3100 is for the vinyl pressing (includes full-color inserts &amp; full color jackets)</li>
<li>$1000 is to finish mixing the songs. (they're all recorded and half-way mixed, but we need help to pay for the rest to be mixed.)</li>
<li>$900 is for mastering, including a separate master for vinyl.</li>
</ul>
<p>With your support, you'll get the vinyl LP and digital download, and lots of other good stuff. (posters that we screen-printed ourselves, a personal live set on video stream. we'll even come play at your house!) </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About J.Stiles / Folded Arms</strong></h3>
<p>For over 25 years I've been writing, recording and performing music. I've been lucky enough to play and tour the country with a band called The Cinderleaf, backed by managers, agents and lawyers (big time, right?) . Additionally, I've been fortunate to write with and perform alongside some talented musicians in The Cemetery Hips, MidAir Collision, The Cobra Cobra Come on Overs as well as recording 3 full length solo albums. </p>
<p>With my 9th album, I decided to take a different approach to making a record. Rather than working with a full band for years to write and refine songs, I challenged myself to track and demo 16 tunes in one short week. </p>
<p>One week later, I met up with the legendary Joe Reyes (of Buttercup fame) at El Jeff Studios and proceeded to build each song with no preconceived notions, tune by tune in the studio. A small handful of talented friends stopped by and helped contribute. After two weeks the ""Folded Arms"" project was complete and is hands down my favorite. </p>
<p>*Fun Fact: Folded Arms is the name of a swanky (and silly) restaurant in the 1966 film, Batman the movie. God Bless Adam West. </p>
<h3><strong>What's This Campaign All About?</strong></h3>
<p>I love records...I've listened to and collected them my entire life. Nothing beats the touch, sound, even the smell of vinyl. Nothing compares to holding the full size artwork in your hand, combing over the lyrics while you commit the time to sit and listen to an artist change your world. </p>
<p>For 25 years I've made music and for even longer I've wanted a real record to call my own. With your help, now is the time! Mixing, mastering and artwork are complete and ready to send to press. You can help make this a reality by pre-purchasing the Folded Arms LP. </p>
<p>You'll get a limited pressing of the album on colored vinyl + all kinds of cool perks. Maybe I'm biased, but I'd totally buy one.</p>
<h3>What's Needed &amp; How It's Used</h3>
<p>This campaign is primarily a pre-order for my album. The perks are all for a bit of extra fun! The minimum needed to fulfill the orders is $4,500. I have listed the breakdown below. </p>
<p>Record pressing - $3,000</p>
<p>Shirt printing - $800</p>
<p>Stickers - $100</p>
<p>Indiegogo + CC fees, taxes, packaging - $600</p>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>With a confirmed number of pre-orders, not only do I know the exact number of records to order, I will also know what funds are left remaining to order extra stock to sell at the merch booth and through the online store.</p>
<h3>Why I Need Your Help...</h3>
<p>The upfront cost of pressing full 12"" vinyl records is quite costly (7-10x more than a CD) and after recording, mixing, mastering, and album art; it's difficult to find the funds to pull it off without assistance. For as long as I have been recording music, I have dreamed of pressing an album onto vinyl and have never had the means to do so until now.  </p>

</div></div>","About J.Stiles / Folded Arms
For over 25 years I've been writing, recording and performing music. I've been lucky enough to play and tour the country with a band called The Cinderleaf, backed by managers, agents and lawyers (big time, right?) . Additionally, I've been fortunate to write with and perform alongside some talented musicians in The Cemetery Hips, MidAir Collision, The Cobra Cobra Come on Overs as well as recording 3 full length solo albums. 
With my 9th album, I decided to take a different approach to making a record. Rather than working with a full band for years to write and refine songs, I challenged myself to track and demo 16 tunes in one short week. 
One week later, I met up with the legendary Joe Reyes (of Buttercup fame) at El Jeff Studios and proceeded to build each song with no preconceived notions, tune by tune in the studio. A small handful of talented friends stopped by and helped contribute. After two weeks the ""Folded Arms"" project was complete and is hands down my favorite. 
*Fun Fact: Folded Arms is the name of a swanky (and silly) restaurant in the 1966 film, Batman the movie. God Bless Adam West. 
What's This Campaign All About?
I love records...I've listened to and collected them my entire life. Nothing beats the touch, sound, even the smell of vinyl. Nothing compares to holding the full size artwork in your hand, combing over the lyrics while you commit the time to sit and listen to an artist change your world. 
For 25 years I've made music and for even longer I've wanted a real record to call my own. With your help, now is the time! Mixing, mastering and artwork are complete and ready to send to press. You can help make this a reality by pre-purchasing the Folded Arms LP. 
You'll get a limited pressing of the album on colored vinyl + all kinds of cool perks. Maybe I'm biased, but I'd totally buy one.
What's Needed & How It's Used
This campaign is primarily a pre-order for my album. The perks are all for a bit of extra fun! The minimum needed to fulfill the orders is $4,500. I have listed the breakdown below. 
Record pressing - $3,000
Shirt printing - $800
Stickers - $100
Indiegogo + CC fees, taxes, packaging - $600
Why It Matters
With a confirmed number of pre-orders, not only do I know the exact number of records to order, I will also know what funds are left remaining to order extra stock to sell at the merch booth and through the online store.
Why I Need Your Help...
The upfront cost of pressing full 12"" vinyl records is quite costly (7-10x more than a CD) and after recording, mixing, mastering, and album art; it's difficult to find the funds to pull it off without assistance. For as long as I have been recording music, I have dreamed of pressing an album onto vinyl and have never had the means to do so until now.  
I intend to make the very best use of all funds received with much gratitude!

~PLANT SEEDS & GROW MUSIC~
For every dollar received for the funding of this album, a seed will be planted.
So let's plant seeds and grow music.
To consciously plant seeds is a way to (re)connect with the earth and contribute to the cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth. Many people have lost their natural way with life and by the simple act of consciously planting seeds back into the earth, we can restore the balance that we have often lost over the course of a lifetime.
Through my music I would like to inspire people to re-think their life and first restore their personal balance with nature and second to research how they can contribute to creating a beautiful world to leave behind for the next generations.

***A CALL TO ACTION***
PLANT SEEDS AND GROW MUSIC
My name is Jennifer Ann and I have been inspired by the ancient traditions for many years now. I had lost my way and connection to natural life many years ago and slowly found my way back to the old traditions and the simplicity of nature.
Through ancient cultures, I was able to relearn the ways of our ancestors on how to stay connected to my soul-mission ( Which we all have!) and receive the light of source energy that floods our beings every moment here on earth, we just simply have to remember to surrender.
Once we understand we are always connected to source energy, this can become a daily practice and guide.
My music is based and inspired by these ancient ways and this is the message I would like to spread.
The album will contain a mixture of mantra, ancient chants and original songs. I have been writing a lot of original songs in the past years, that I would love to record properly. For example this song:
https://soundcloud.com/jenniferannsings/pachamama-sing-to-me
My journey has taken me from the deep roots of the Amazon jungle, 
to the high mountains of the Himalaya's. 
And now it's my time to give back all that I have learned.
Over the years, I have studied yoga, learned about plants, natural building, natural medicines, meditation, breathing , traveling, ancient ways, indigenous cultures, community, art and so much more. I have been sharing this in classes, workshops, retreats, ceremonies and music around the globe and still growing.
Now is my time to:
GO BIG,
THINK BIG,
FEEL BIG,
GIVE BACK BIG,
RECEIVE BIG,
SHARE BIG....
Because there is no time to wait, waist or hesitate. I am ready to give back to the people and back to the earth. This is the way, THE TIME IS NOW. We are here to inspire, educate and share the love.
Here's a video of a workshop I was teaching with Ayla Schafer. We are playing the ho'oponopono song, one of the songs that wants to be recorded.

Joining Erin, to document the creative process and translate it into a documentary film, is Juno-award winner Amelia Curran.</p><p>The fun part is not only are Erin and Amelia award winning artists and performers, they are also close friends. They have admired each other's work for more than a decade but have yet to collaborate on a project. This will be special.

<h2>To begin...</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, I've recorded EP's in both a traditional studio setting (<i>Orwin Orioles</i>) and live in the multi-purpose space at the charter school I've worked at since moving to North Carolina (<i>Carter</i>).  While I loved the finished product of those recordings, I know that it's finally time to make a legitimate full-length record.    </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520888125/q5ppn1ped2ymyvvjcbeq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520888212/etuev2kx828khr5tmbbb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>SO...</h2>
<p>At the end of April, I'll be traveling to <i>Nashville, Tennessee</i> to record my first full-length album at the<a href=""https://www.bombshelterstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Bomb Shelter</a> with producer/engineer Billy Bennett.    I've enlisted a number of incredibly talented Nashville musicians to play with me, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBMte9WBg_A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wallace Lester</a> </strong>(North Mississippi drumming extraordinaire: <i>The Como Mamas, Kenny Brown, most of the sons of RL Burnside and Junior Kimbrough...</i>)</li>
<li>
<strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR6-sii0NJY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heather Moulder</a> </strong>(Just about the best keys player in Tennessee...)</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHQjZ_qcpoE&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Uncle Reed Turchi</strong></a> (Frequent collaborator and engineer on <i>Carter, </i>honorary Uncle to Jack, nasty North Mississippi-style slide guitarist)</li>
<li><strong>Whoever else I can afford to ask to guest on the record...</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520886069/cvl0zgohfbhe24synfqy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>The songs...</h2>
<p>I've been writing songs for this record since 2009.  Some of them have been part of my live set for upwards of a decade, while others have been written in the last two months.   For a number of these tracks, it's simply time to commit them to tape and move forward.  I've found myself hung up on them for too long, holding out to commit them to other projects in hopes that this day would come.  They're meant to live on ""Shenandoah"" and I'm excited for you to here  the way they were meant to be presented.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgFzSwa7I3o?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h2>The costs...</h2>
<p>Making this album the wait it was intended to be heard is my number one priority.  I've cut corners in the past and settled for less than what I heard in my head, but I've committed to going for it this time around.  Getting an album to sound like those that you hear on the radio can be costly.  For the sake of transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Studio Time: $700 (<i>A Steal!)</i></strong></li>
<li><b>Paying the Band: $500</b></li>
<li><b>Magnetic Tape <i>(Strictly analog, homie)</i>: $100</b></li>
<li><b>Feeding the band/engineer: $100</b></li>
<li><b>Mixing: $700-$900</b></li>
</ul>
<p>That total brings me to nearly <b>$2300 (!)</b> without even factoring in <strong>travel to Nashville</strong>, <strong>mastering</strong>, <b>or the physical production of the CD's, t-shirts, and stickers to give to you!  </b>Malynda Resh from <strong><a href=""https://www.heyoverherecreative.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hey Over Here Creative</a> </strong>has graciously created the artwork for all of my releases and designed my website pro bono up to this point, and I'd sure love to pay her for all of her incredible work as well.  </p>
<h2>Where YOU come in...</h2>
<p>Every single dollar pledged towards this campaign will help me make the best record possible.  A few $10 pledges allows me the freedom to record an extra song or two for the album or helps to pay for the down-payment on a mastering session.  I'm pumping as much of my own savings into this project as I can without forcing my son to drop out of daycare or take his first job at the age of two... (<i>I'm kidding - please don't call Social Services on me.  Kthx.)</i></p>
<p><strong>On the right side of this screen, you'll see pledge amounts and the perks that come along with them.  Pledge amounts range from $5 to $500 and everywhere in between.  Quite frankly, no pledge is too small or insignificant.  I'm incredibly thankful for anything and everything you offer, so THANK YOU in advance.  I literally cannot do this without you.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>How else can I help, dude?</strong></h2>
<p>That's a good question, self acting as the voice of my friend or family member reading this right now.  If you can afford to make a pledge, please do!  However, I absolutely understand if you can't.  We all have bills and children who need braces and piano lessons, so don't sweat it if you can't swing it.   Simply post the link to this campaign on your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or grandma's front door and put out the good word for your ol' friend John Joseph Boxter Jr.  Bug a friend at work.  Start a conversation with a perfect stranger in the bathroom.  I've taken the liberty of creating some great one liners to get the proverbial ball rolling for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>""<strong><i>Hey bro, sick form on your squats.  Anyway, ever hear of this sad Americana singer named JB Boxter?  He's got this record about coal mines and Japanese trees... so dope!""</i></strong>

</div></div>","To begin...
Over the last few years, I've recorded EP's in both a traditional studio setting (Orwin Orioles) and live in the multi-purpose space at the charter school I've worked at since moving to North Carolina (Carter).  While I loved the finished product of those recordings, I know that it's finally time to make a legitimate full-length record.    


SO...
At the end of April, I'll be traveling to Nashville, Tennessee to record my first full-length album at the Bomb Shelter with producer/engineer Billy Bennett.    I've enlisted a number of incredibly talented Nashville musicians to play with me, including:


Wallace Lester (North Mississippi drumming extraordinaire: The Como Mamas, Kenny Brown, most of the sons of RL Burnside and Junior Kimbrough...)

Heather Moulder (Just about the best keys player in Tennessee...)

Uncle Reed Turchi (Frequent collaborator and engineer on Carter, honorary Uncle to Jack, nasty North Mississippi-style slide guitarist)
Whoever else I can afford to ask to guest on the record...


The songs...
I've been writing songs for this record since 2009.  Some of them have been part of my live set for upwards of a decade, while others have been written in the last two months.   For a number of these tracks, it's simply time to commit them to tape and move forward.  I've found myself hung up on them for too long, holding out to commit them to other projects in hopes that this day would come.  They're meant to live on ""Shenandoah"" and I'm excited for you to here  the way they were meant to be presented.

The costs...
Making this album the wait it was intended to be heard is my number one priority.  I've cut corners in the past and settled for less than what I heard in my head, but I've committed to going for it this time around.  Getting an album to sound like those that you hear on the radio can be costly.  For the sake of transparency:

Studio Time: $700 (A Steal!)
Paying the Band: $500
Magnetic Tape (Strictly analog, homie): $100
Feeding the band/engineer: $100
Mixing: $700-$900

That total brings me to nearly $2300 (!) without even factoring in travel to Nashville, mastering, or the physical production of the CD's, t-shirts, and stickers to give to you!  Malynda Resh from Hey Over Here Creative has graciously created the artwork for all of my releases and designed my website pro bono up to this point, and I'd sure love to pay her for all of her incredible work as well.  
Where YOU come in...
Every single dollar pledged towards this campaign will help me make the best record possible.  A few $10 pledges allows me the freedom to record an extra song or two for the album or helps to pay for the down-payment on a mastering session.  I'm pumping as much of my own savings into this project as I can without forcing my son to drop out of daycare or take his first job at the age of two... (I'm kidding - please don't call Social Services on me.  Kthx.)
On the right side of this screen, you'll see pledge amounts and the perks that come along with them.  Pledge amounts range from $5 to $500 and everywhere in between.  Quite frankly, no pledge is too small or insignificant.  I'm incredibly thankful for anything and everything you offer, so THANK YOU in advance.  I literally cannot do this without you.
How else can I help, dude?
That's a good question, self acting as the voice of my friend or family member reading this right now.  If you can afford to make a pledge, please do!  However, I absolutely understand if you can't.  We all have bills and children who need braces and piano lessons, so don't sweat it if you can't swing it.   Simply post the link to this campaign on your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or grandma's front door and put out the good word for your ol' friend John Joseph Boxter Jr.  Bug a friend at work.  Start a conversation with a perfect stranger in the bathroom.  I've taken the liberty of creating some great one liners to get the proverbial ball rolling for you:

""Hey bro, sick form on your squats.  Anyway, ever hear of this sad Americana singer named JB Boxter?  He's got this record about coal mines and Japanese trees... so dope!""

""Excuse me, Ma'am - have you heard of my friend JB Boxter?  You'd really love his song... ma'am... please don't close the door... calling the cops isn't necessary... I'll let myself out... lovely dining room you have!""
""Seriously though, __________________ (your boss name here).  Forget my Christmas bonus this year - how about pledging for a private house show for the company with JB Boxter?

All jokes aside, passing this along to anyone whom you think might dig my music goes a long way.  Thank you again.  
Cheers,

<h3>Story about Mariachi Samurai </h3>
<p>Mariachi Samurai is headed by Sam Moreno, who discovered mariachi and ranchera music in 1972 and went to Mexico to study latin music. Ever since then he has been a pioneer of spreading the beauty of mariachi music in Japan. He also participated in the 1st mariachi festival in Guadalajara, Mexico back in 1994. Sam started Mariachi Samurai in 2000, one of the only full mariachi bands in Japan. Mariachi Samurai has gotten an endorsement from the Mexican embassy in Japan and performed in various functions of the embassy as well as Latin American events in Japan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mariachi Samurai was officially invited to attend the 25th anniversary of the Mariachi Festival in Guadalajara, Mexico and would love to attend as it is such a special year. </p>
<p>Additionally, as Mexico suffered a huge loss last year from the devastating earthquake we would also like to visit the disaster stricken zone near Mexico City and conduct a charity concert there. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 10,000USD to cover part of the flights. As we are a group of 11 members including dancers, only flights alone cost about 20,000USD. We are simultaneously conducting fund raising concerts but it is difficult to get this amount by just that so we hope you can help us fly there. Any additional fee we can get over 10,000USD we will use for ground transportation fee, to organize the charity concert, tour promo and management. </p>
<p>Mariachi Samurai is an independent group (no label, publishing deal, industry money of any kind). We do everything by ourselves  so you are the only way we are going to be able to afford this tour.</p>
<p>Together with your support, we will make this tour happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In return for your money we offer you a list of exclusive gifts and offerings depending on your pledge amount. The gifts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Postcard from Japan</li>
<li>Download of recorded songs by Mariachi Samurai and Sawaka Katalyna</li>
<li>Photo book of the Mexican tour</li>
<li>Mexican mini souvenir (eg. mini sombrero, bookmark, etc.)</li>
<li>Live broadcast performance over Skype or similar software (We can separately discuss about going to play live instead of over Skype if timing works and transportation and accommodation is provided)</li>
<li>Original song with your name</li>
</ul>
<p>*Even if we don't reach the goal we would like to use the money we can raise to help fund our flights. </p>

<h3>What did we make?</h3>
<p>A lot has changed for me in the last several years. I moved to Kansas City in 2015 after losing a job and having much of my life in Wichita fall apart, but continued to write songs during that time. The result was a new batch of tunes that became the foundation for this project,<strong> Mr. Golden Sun.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Central States EP</strong> is a collection of songs that grapple with anxiety, doubt, and an attempt to maintain some sense of normalcy when the world feels like it's spinning out of control. I became really interested in telling small, personal stories about the people and places around me, whether autobiographically and fictitiously. There's a bit of both on here. And I'm really happy with how it's turning out.</p>
<p>My band and I pieced this EP together over the course of the last year, recording in various studios, living rooms, bathrooms, and other varied spaces in the KC metro area. Other musicians that played on the album were <strong>Ryan Shaw </strong>(drums), <strong>Joey Panella </strong>(bass), <strong>Jonathan Smith</strong> (keys), <strong>Bethany Slack</strong>, (vocals), and <strong>Nathan Wilhoit </strong>(piano). </p>
<p>It was all mixed by <strong>Sean Lea</strong>, who also recorded vocals and some other bits and bobs. <strong>Michael Collins </strong>tracked the drums and bass. I recorded the rest myself (learning a ton along the way).</p>
<p><strong>TW Walsh </strong>is mastering it. He used to be in Pedro the Lion, and has worked on records by Sufjan Stevens, Damien Jurado, The Shins, and tons of other fantastic-sounding recordings.</p>
<p>It's all nearly completed and <strong>we need you</strong> to help us push it across the finish line.</p>
<p>Money raised through this campaign will to toward offsetting recording, mixing, and mastering costs.</p>
<h3>What does it sound like?</h3>
<p>Sonically, the goal was to combine earthy, organic sounds like acoustic guitars and drums with more inorganic synthesizers and drum machines. Much of the EP leans toward ""folk"" stylistically, but with a much more atmospheric sound palate.<br/><br/>If you're not already familiar with our work, take a listen/look at the first two singles that we completed and released here:</p>

</div><div>
<p>I also recorded two live acoustic sessions of songs off the EP with filmmaker <strong>Cole Blaise</strong>. Imagine these, but with like, more instruments.</p>

<h3>What We Need / What You Get</h3>
<p>The initial goal is set at $3,000. This will to toward offsetting recording, mixing, and mastering costs for recording the EP. Beyond just digital copies of the EP, we're offering perks in exchange for your help, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A classy, ultra-comfy t-shirt with three different color options.</li>
<li>Artwork by my daughter Wren (she's very excited about this).</li>
<li>A lyric booklet lovingly typed out on a Smith Corona typewriter.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why support this project?</h3>
<p>I really believe that art is worth investing in. Music in particular is at a weird point in which we expect it to continue to be made and expect to listen to it on demand, without cost. But someone always has to pay for it to be made, and without a record label, that's up to me to figure out. </p>
<p>Here's a chance to lessen that personal burden and help me put something I really believe in out into the world.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","What did we make?
A lot has changed for me in the last several years. I moved to Kansas City in 2015 after losing a job and having much of my life in Wichita fall apart, but continued to write songs during that time. The result was a new batch of tunes that became the foundation for this project, Mr. Golden Sun.
The Central States EP is a collection of songs that grapple with anxiety, doubt, and an attempt to maintain some sense of normalcy when the world feels like it's spinning out of control. I became really interested in telling small, personal stories about the people and places around me, whether autobiographically and fictitiously. There's a bit of both on here. And I'm really happy with how it's turning out.
My band and I pieced this EP together over the course of the last year, recording in various studios, living rooms, bathrooms, and other varied spaces in the KC metro area. Other musicians that played on the album were Ryan Shaw (drums), Joey Panella (bass), Jonathan Smith (keys), Bethany Slack, (vocals), and Nathan Wilhoit (piano). 
It was all mixed by Sean Lea, who also recorded vocals and some other bits and bobs. Michael Collins tracked the drums and bass. I recorded the rest myself (learning a ton along the way).
TW Walsh is mastering it. He used to be in Pedro the Lion, and has worked on records by Sufjan Stevens, Damien Jurado, The Shins, and tons of other fantastic-sounding recordings.
It's all nearly completed and we need you to help us push it across the finish line.
Money raised through this campaign will to toward offsetting recording, mixing, and mastering costs.
What does it sound like?
Sonically, the goal was to combine earthy, organic sounds like acoustic guitars and drums with more inorganic synthesizers and drum machines. Much of the EP leans toward ""folk"" stylistically, but with a much more atmospheric sound palate.If you're not already familiar with our work, take a listen/look at the first two singles that we completed and released here:
Heavy Water (Official Video)

 
Place & Time (Single)


I also recorded two live acoustic sessions of songs off the EP with filmmaker Cole Blaise. Imagine these, but with like, more instruments.
Goldfinches (Morton Hall Session)

 
Julianne in Tangerine (Morton Hall Session)

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Miranda Delgado, a Christian Country music artist, and I am very happy to share some exciting news with y’all! I am about to complete my first EP titled J-TOWN (Jesus Town)! Releasing a record has always been my dream since I was playing in overalls with chickens and birds at age 5 in Fort Worth, Texas. I have invested more than $8,000 working with award-winning producers to record five songs that communicate a message of faith-based hope, and raise awareness of some of our human struggles affecting society today. Now, I need your help to get to the finish line. I am requesting $4,000 to complete the last part of the project, which is mixing and mastering, distribution, and recording the music video for the release of the first single. If you are as passionate as I am about reaching the world with good news, please consider making a contribution to help me get these songs out, and spread much needed hope to our world.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of how your contribution will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Mixing and</strong> <strong>mastering</strong> - $1,900</li>
<li>
<strong>Distribution</strong>- $522.75</li>
<li>
<strong>Recording of first single music video</strong>- $1,577.25 minus campaign fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should the campaign exceed the goal amount, I will use the extra funds for the music video, marketing, social media, and advertising. If I receive less than the set goal, the priority will be the mixing and mastering. As a token of appreciation, I have prepared a tiered list of perks for contributors that include, but are not limited to: single digital downloads, Full EP digital downloads, CD copies, an invitation to be a part of a Closed Group that will continue to receive news and other fun stuff first before general public release, and house concerts. Please refer to the Perks section for more details.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>J-TOWN is an EP (extended playlist) containing five songs. I have chosen these songs because they communicate a faith-based message, and/or are conversation starters about issues affecting society and the human being. I sincerely believe that listeners will be encouraged to take positive action for the betterment of themselves, and to raise the quality of life of their families.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>J-TOWN</strong> (Jesus Town) - This song is about the joy of belonging to a community of faith. It was written at a time when my husband and I were reconnecting with God and the church- a place where you can find real love, where you can be honest about your struggles, and where you receive blessings from God.</li>
<li>
<strong>JESUS CRAZY</strong>- This is my story, and the story of many men and women who have adopted a Christian worldview as their lives’ guiding principle. Sometimes people make fun of you. Well, I happen to enjoy my “Jesus Craziness” and it is perfectly okay for you to be a Christian too! This song is so much fun!  I can’t wait for you to hear it!</li>
<li>
<strong>JESSIE</strong> – Bullying, anxiety, depression, and suicide. This is a conversation between a high school girl at her breaking point, and God. Sometimes we get to a place where we feel that there is no way out of our troubling circumstances, and that ending our lives is the only way to escape. Maybe nobody else is listening to us, but God is, and we need to hear His response.</li>
<li>
<strong>WALL OF FIRE </strong>– In a world in which domestic violence, abuse, and harassment are everyday news, a mother talks to her teenage daughter about the characteristics of a good partner. This is one of my favorite songs because it encourages individuals to look for signs, and to not accept less than a person that will be a wall of fire around them, someone who will surround them with a kind of love that will burn any evil coming their way.</li>
<li>
<strong>BRAND NEW DAY </strong>– This song is very close to my heart for several reasons. As a past victim of abuse, I know how hard it can be to get out of an abusive relationship. It takes a special kind of courage that only God can provide. Many women pray for strength to be able to escape, and many die in the process. God can save you from the grave, and show you a brand new day.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for considering contributing to this campaign. If you can’t contribute at this time, it doesn't mean you can't help! Get the word out and make some noise about my campaign. Remember that you can use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>WHY I MUST DO IT!</strong></u></p>
<p>I am a singer-songwriter and the piano is my instrument. My songs are varied in style, sort of a travelogue of the places I've lived. Songwriting and performing give me a place to put my passion and a way to make sense of myself.</p>
<p>Music reorganizes my nervous system and reconnects me to my source. I feel deeply encouraged when listeners tell me that they can relate to what I'm expressing. My fondest wish is to continue my art  as a catharsis, a spell, a prayer, and an emotional bridge to those who feel a kinship with my songs. Your participation in my campaign is the foundation of that bridge, a dream that I have been working towards all of my life.</p>
<p><u><strong>HOW I MUST DO IT!</strong></u></p>
<p>This campaign is about making an album of my original material; I reduced the budget by choosing not to create a physical CD. I love vinyl, CD’s, and cassettes and I still buy used copies, but with so many music streaming organizations, there is no need to create more plastic products.</p>
<p>I arrived at the budget for my campaign ($29,600) based on the cost to record No Fumare. This estimate includes studio costs, musicians’ fees, copyright and licensing fees for eleven original songs, plus legal advice, design, promotions, and the money I borrowed to make the music video.</p>
<p>I have already started writing the script for my second music video, so if there’s any money left over after making the album, I would like to start production on the video. I am still amazed by how the first one came together; I had no previous experience, so the extraordinary talent and dedication of the actors and support persons was indispensable. Making the video was one of the most challenging and exciting things I’ve ever done.</p>
<p><u><strong>WHY <i>YOU</i> MIGHT DO IT!</strong></u></p>
<p>I have been told that crowdfunding must be done in a certain way, starting with my appearance in a video “pitching” my appeal for support. What I planned all along and what feels much more rich to me is to use my music video for this purpose. My pitch is about my desire to inject more magic, love, and emotional depth into this precious world of ours, and the music video illustrates my version of that. I am hoping that the inclusion of the song and video also serves as an indication of my capabilities, and my commitment to my vision.</p>

<br/><br/> </div><p> </p></div>","WHY I MUST DO IT!
I am a singer-songwriter and the piano is my instrument. My songs are varied in style, sort of a travelogue of the places I've lived. Songwriting and performing give me a place to put my passion and a way to make sense of myself.
Music reorganizes my nervous system and reconnects me to my source. I feel deeply encouraged when listeners tell me that they can relate to what I'm expressing. My fondest wish is to continue my art  as a catharsis, a spell, a prayer, and an emotional bridge to those who feel a kinship with my songs. Your participation in my campaign is the foundation of that bridge, a dream that I have been working towards all of my life.
HOW I MUST DO IT!
This campaign is about making an album of my original material; I reduced the budget by choosing not to create a physical CD. I love vinyl, CD’s, and cassettes and I still buy used copies, but with so many music streaming organizations, there is no need to create more plastic products.
I arrived at the budget for my campaign ($29,600) based on the cost to record No Fumare. This estimate includes studio costs, musicians’ fees, copyright and licensing fees for eleven original songs, plus legal advice, design, promotions, and the money I borrowed to make the music video.
I have already started writing the script for my second music video, so if there’s any money left over after making the album, I would like to start production on the video. I am still amazed by how the first one came together; I had no previous experience, so the extraordinary talent and dedication of the actors and support persons was indispensable. Making the video was one of the most challenging and exciting things I’ve ever done.
WHY YOU MIGHT DO IT!
I have been told that crowdfunding must be done in a certain way, starting with my appearance in a video “pitching” my appeal for support. What I planned all along and what feels much more rich to me is to use my music video for this purpose. My pitch is about my desire to inject more magic, love, and emotional depth into this precious world of ours, and the music video illustrates my version of that. I am hoping that the inclusion of the song and video also serves as an indication of my capabilities, and my commitment to my vision.

<h3>Meet Tim, Joseph and Michael:</h3>
<p>We are a trio - saxophone, bass and drums, who've been playing together as a group for about two years, but have known each other for decades.  Have a look at the video to see what we do.  We were attracted to the song, Ahab Makan, while preparing for our trip to Sudan. We decided to play it to show the process of a familiar melody being transformed by jazz improvisation.  It was met with enthusiasm by Sudanese audiences - and our friends at the US Embassy, who had invited us to Khartoum, suggested we film a recording of the song.  We asked if they could hook us up with some Sudanese musicians to participate - and before we knew it, we were laughing, playing and eating all over Khartoum with a brilliant director, dancers, musicians and a drone camera operator.</p>

<p>Mai Khidir was born in Sudan, pursued higher education in the UK, and is now back in Khartoum, running the organization she founded - Al Sudaniya Mentoring.  ASM's mission is to empower women by giving them access to mentors with expertise in the fields in which they want to pursue dreams.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have put my heart into these songs. Honestly, I don't know any other way to write songs.

<p>Asking people for money is the<strong> hardest thing in the world</strong> for me to do. I rather just create music and not have to deal with the business side of everything. But I believe that people need to hear these songs. Funding this is not only to get my music into your hands but you're supporting a dream that has been in my heart since I fell in love with music when I was 13. I have always waited for the day when I can share my music in the form of an EP, or rather a full on concept, to the world</p>

</li>
<li>It will get my music into your hands with out a third-party that don't really pay artists anything</li>
<li>The perks will allow my name to get out as an artist when it comes to shirts/stickers that you rock</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Dream</h3>
<p>No fancy studio. Just a shed in my best friends backyard (known as Threebyfive Records lol), my dorm room, my parents house, and a boy with a dream. All I want to do is create art that First, speaks to me and Secondly, art that speaks what words can't. I hope these songs become your songs as well. An anthem for the hurting, broken, confused, and for the dreamers. </p>

<h3>How did the Tubes come into being?</h3>
</div>
<p>I'm the inventor of the JumpDrum,  an innovative percussion instrument <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559851456/fnzshrtaiv2mztat7uev.jpg"" src=""""/>that's also an exercise. But it's large, almost 8' tall and made of solid Baltic Birch plywood. I'd been getting many calls for a ""kids"" version of the JumpDrum when I came across theses amazing sounding PVC tubes. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559591247/nfe0t67vrzjgmukavjgz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>""These are perfect for kids,""</i> I thought. <i>""Colorful, light, wonderful sound. But how do I attach them to the JumpDrum?""</i></p>
<p>First I came up with the frame using oak dowels and thin aluminum bars, but attaching it to the Thumper required the use of the Tripod support (used on the JumpDrum) which was a heavy and long piece of aluminum tubing. Definitely not for kids!</p>
<p>And then, while attempting to support the JumpDrum without the tripod, I accidentally invented the ""simple stand"" which has not only made the Tubes possible, but also simplified the design of the JumpDrum (available on the <a href=""http://www.jumpdrum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">JumpDrum.com</a> website if your interested--this campaign is about the TUBES, however).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559617342/lvhfqskcem6jfhrolgcf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>JumpDrum TUBES on Simple Stand</i></p>
<p>And then I realized that I could put wooden dowels in place of PVC tubes. And then I tried aluminum tubes. And then even cardboard shipping tubes!  And they all worked...but I was still limited by the width of the frame. If a tube or dowel was wider than the frame, they banged against it when hit...until I came up with the patent pending ""pull forward"" design!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559686026/wmg8qxpsv7hv9smllpxo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now, although the frame is 26"" wide, you can put any length dowel or tube in the hold, activate the pull forward bungies, and voila, your sound is pure!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559591347/aho1uahuwkqv7wc1p112.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Is it for kids or adults? For Professionals or beginners?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559844397/szpaxiahb0vzxkngfseh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>It's both for both questions!</i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For kids, we recommend the basic Tubes or the Tubes + Thumper. The Tubes are lighter and the sound is mellower than the dowels or chimes.</li>
<li>For Adults who are beginning percussionists we recommend the basic Tubes.</li>
<li>For Adults who frequent drum circles we recommend the dowels. Tubes would need amplification in such a setting.</li>
<li>For Adults who want to get a workout while they play, we recommend Dowels + Thumper.</li>
<li>For percussionist, we recommend the whole package, Tubes, Dowels, Chimes +Thumper. </li>
</ul>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559777747/cxl5vb531i7lqjnerz4h.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's that box he's standing on?</h3>
<p>The THUMPER is JumpDrum's proprietary bass drum. You play by marching, dancing or bouncing atop. The actuator located on the right underside of the spring platform activated the drum pedal when the user leans, marches, or bounces on that side. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560426190/x3xgwyik485mev69ckne.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've designed the Tubes as a <strong>user friendly device</strong> in the sense that no matter what we <i>sell</i> I know that people will experiment with their own materials. But it must ship with some sound generators, and I feel the PVC tubes are the best choice. They have a rich tonal sound which can be changed by simply adding or removing the end cap. They are light &amp; colorful. It's a win/win for kids, adults, percussionist, or just hobbyists. But the PVC tubes are the one part we need to import. <i>We need to place a large order to keep our price low</i>. And the more we sell, the more we can pass on our discount to you the buyer.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are already in production building frames and simple stands. </li>
<li>We have distributors in place for Hardwood (Maple, Walnut, Birch) dowels.</li>
<li>We just need pre-orders to ensure we can move the large quantity of tubes we need to purchase.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p><i><strong>Rhythm is the fasted way to raise your vibration. </strong></i>People are sitting down way to much these days. Our whole product line is about standing up and moving. Our intention is to wake people up to their true nature and potential!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><strong>""A growing body of research shows that drumming has a positive effect on Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, depression, PTSD, and more.""</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">Dale Eisinger,<i> The Daily Beast</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Even without the Thumper base, standing up and drumming is a workout.</li>
<li>People are getting fit with the JumpDrum, this is your chance to experience the same benefits at a lower cost. </li>
<li>Kids are drawn to drums, but traditional drums are too loud. The Tubes have a mellow tone that kids and adults will love!</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><i><strong>""Drumming Places One in the Present Moment""</strong></i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><i><strong>""Drumming helps alleviate stress that is created from hanging on to the past or worrying about the future. When one plays a drum, one is placed squarely in the here and now.""</strong></i></p>

<h2>What's so simple about the Simple Stand?</h2>
<p>The great thing about the simple stand is that it's just a few piece of loose wood. But you screw them together, and then slip other pieces over and . . . well it's easier just to see a picture of the parts:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Note: The video below was made for the JumpDrum and I'm standing on a Standard Thumper. We are offering the Thumper mini in this campaign, but it functions the same. Instead of 24""x24"" the mini is 24""x16"". </i></p>

<h2>Dowel, Chime, &amp; Tube Pitches</h2>

How did the Tubes come into being?

I'm the inventor of the JumpDrum,  an innovative percussion instrument that's also an exercise. But it's large, almost 8' tall and made of solid Baltic Birch plywood. I'd been getting many calls for a ""kids"" version of the JumpDrum when I came across theses amazing sounding PVC tubes. 
""These are perfect for kids,"" I thought. ""Colorful, light, wonderful sound. But how do I attach them to the JumpDrum?""
First I came up with the frame using oak dowels and thin aluminum bars, but attaching it to the Thumper required the use of the Tripod support (used on the JumpDrum) which was a heavy and long piece of aluminum tubing. Definitely not for kids!
And then, while attempting to support the JumpDrum without the tripod, I accidentally invented the ""simple stand"" which has not only made the Tubes possible, but also simplified the design of the JumpDrum (available on the JumpDrum.com website if your interested--this campaign is about the TUBES, however).

JumpDrum TUBES on Simple Stand
And then I realized that I could put wooden dowels in place of PVC tubes. And then I tried aluminum tubes. And then even cardboard shipping tubes!  And they all worked...but I was still limited by the width of the frame. If a tube or dowel was wider than the frame, they banged against it when hit...until I came up with the patent pending ""pull forward"" design!

Now, although the frame is 26"" wide, you can put any length dowel or tube in the hold, activate the pull forward bungies, and voila, your sound is pure!


Is it for kids or adults? For Professionals or beginners?

It's both for both questions!

For kids, we recommend the basic Tubes or the Tubes + Thumper. The Tubes are lighter and the sound is mellower than the dowels or chimes.
For Adults who are beginning percussionists we recommend the basic Tubes.
For Adults who frequent drum circles we recommend the dowels. Tubes would need amplification in such a setting.
For Adults who want to get a workout while they play, we recommend Dowels + Thumper.
For percussionist, we recommend the whole package, Tubes, Dowels, Chimes +Thumper. 


 
What's that box he's standing on?
The THUMPER is JumpDrum's proprietary bass drum. You play by marching, dancing or bouncing atop. The actuator located on the right underside of the spring platform activated the drum pedal when the user leans, marches, or bounces on that side. 

 
What We Need & What You Get
I've designed the Tubes as a user friendly device in the sense that no matter what we sell I know that people will experiment with their own materials. But it must ship with some sound generators, and I feel the PVC tubes are the best choice. They have a rich tonal sound which can be changed by simply adding or removing the end cap. They are light & colorful. It's a win/win for kids, adults, percussionist, or just hobbyists. But the PVC tubes are the one part we need to import. We need to place a large order to keep our price low. And the more we sell, the more we can pass on our discount to you the buyer.

We are already in production building frames and simple stands. 
We have distributors in place for Hardwood (Maple, Walnut, Birch) dowels.
We just need pre-orders to ensure we can move the large quantity of tubes we need to purchase.


Benefits
Rhythm is the fasted way to raise your vibration. People are sitting down way to much these days. Our whole product line is about standing up and moving. Our intention is to wake people up to their true nature and potential!
""A growing body of research shows that drumming has a positive effect on Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, depression, PTSD, and more."" 
Dale Eisinger, The Daily Beast

Even without the Thumper base, standing up and drumming is a workout.
People are getting fit with the JumpDrum, this is your chance to experience the same benefits at a lower cost. 
Kids are drawn to drums, but traditional drums are too loud. The Tubes have a mellow tone that kids and adults will love!

""Drumming Places One in the Present Moment""
""Drumming helps alleviate stress that is created from hanging on to the past or worrying about the future. When one plays a drum, one is placed squarely in the here and now.""
Michael Drake, About Religion
What's so simple about the Simple Stand?
The great thing about the simple stand is that it's just a few piece of loose wood. But you screw them together, and then slip other pieces over and . . . well it's easier just to see a picture of the parts:

becomes this:

​What about the Thumper. How does it work?
Note: The video below was made for the JumpDrum and I'm standing on a Standard Thumper. We are offering the Thumper mini in this campaign, but it functions the same. Instead of 24""x24"" the mini is 24""x16"". 


 
Dowel, Chime, & Tube Pitches
On some of the videos I played 2"" thick dowels cut to different lengths, on others I used 1.25"" dowels. It's also possible to use dowels of the same length but different diameter--as with the chimes. The tubes come with a cap that raises the octave, so one length can represent two separate octaves. We aim to eventually offer custom pitches for all three variations of the instrument, however, at this time, we are including just the pitches deemed most effective for each sound generator by inventor/composer David De Palo. R&D is ongoing on this front.
As of the moment we launch, the pitches of the Tubes are Bb, Eb, G, Bb, Eb. The 1.25"" dowels are F#,E,G,D,F#, and the Chimes are G#,A,C,E,G nat. However, all pitches are subject to change. We will notify you if/when we have options for you to choose from.

Risks & Challenges

All of our instruments are handcrafted in Connecticut, USA. We are a small operation, but our process is easily scalable. With your pre-orders we can move into a larger facility. But setting up an efficient manufacturing facility is no small order.

Luckily, David is very adept at moving the shop and re-arranging equipment.
We already have the JumpDrum workshop pumping out thumpers. It won't be hard to expand into the TUBES.
If we don't reach our funding goal, we'll still be able to fulfill your orders, but our margin will be drastically reduced.

There is so much more to a tour than getting to a gig, setting up, singing, then going home. There is finding safe places to stay in the middle of nowhere, finding an open eatery, having a flat tire, needing medicine or medical attention, broken equipment, broken strings, and the list goes on and on.

Two that can be revealed now is one of the most sought-after New Orleans groove keepers in the business, New Orleans Suspects &amp; former Jon Cleary drummer, <strong>Eddie Christmas</strong>. The Uptown native, will be ""bringin' that thang"" like only he can bring on the drums.  Secondly, on keys, <strong>Bill McKay </strong>joins the project with his legendary right hand and extensive experience with acts such as The Derek Trucks Band, Leftover Salmon, Band Du Jour &amp; Coral Creek just to name a few.  Consequently, Johnny &amp; The Mongrels is a special collaboration that defies musical boundaries to organically produce some of the most notable new music 2020 will have to offer.</p><p>Both fate and instincts originally led Johnny Ryan to collaborate with Jeff Bostic. Aside from both musicians growing to appreciate each others individual projects over a 5 year period, Johnny Ryan and Jeff Bostic legitimately connected at an impromptu blues jam in 2015. Playing together where neither had the inherent pressure of being the leader of the show, allowed them to relate on a different level away from the hustle and bustle of their usual working musician lives and they found a common ground of interest and excitement for the future. And the rest is ""Mongrels History!""</p><p>From there, recognition and admiration for the duo prompted Snapped On The River Music's own <strong>Joe Michaels</strong>, to introduce himself and offer to produce this project.  And with the addition of revered, industry-wide recognizable musicians like Scott Sharrard, Eddie Christmas, Bill McKay and those still to be named, some would say it would be down right foolish to miss out on bragging you had a hand in bringing this project to life!</p><p>Johnny notes that the end product of Johnny &amp; The Mongrels' 1st full length album has no preconceived sound because that would limit the possibilities. Both Johnny, Bostic and Sharrard brought songs to the table from writing sessions they had in New York City. And more often than not, one would start making noise, another would riff off of it, while another created lyrics and songs would be born. All the artists involved took to the studio with a ""see what happens"" mentality and thusly created ""a project even mama would be proud of"" according to Johnny.</p><p>Prestige and prowess of the artists aside, the music of Johnny &amp; The Mongrels speaks for itself. This eclectic group of players is eager to see where the project takes them and to get the music heard by as many people as possible. Johnny &amp; The Mongrels has become a truly organic collaboration with the music taking form out of what feels natural and evolving into an honest, feel-good collection of songs.</p><h2><strong>Meet The Band</strong></h2><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560445121/wzwhakkbtpmy5koxfzzh.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><h3><strong>Johnny Ryan</strong></h3><p>Johnny's been immersed in professional music virtually all of his life, even as a small boy, due to the fact that the majority of his family has always been involved in the professional music industry.</p><p>He started out at the age of 7 and could be seen performing with his families various professional projects, wowing the audience with ""beyond his years"" tone and presence.</p><p>Since 1999, Johnny has been immersed in several live performance projects in the local Colorado music scene.

Starting piano and violin lessons at the age of 4, music was always around, whether strumming a guitar with his dad or a vocal group at school.</p><p>Sadly, at 15, Jeff took the unfortunate passing of his dad as inspiration to carry the torch, and he used that motivation to further dedicate himself.

Having unfortgettable images and video will inspire and document the passion and excitement of this project for years to come.</p><h2>Help us bring this incredible project to the world!</h2><ul>
<li><p>Launching a project like this is quite the endeavor. Getting time at the right studio, with the right musicians, engineers and producers is key to the vision and feel of the album. Additionally, the selection of where to mix and master the tracks (songs) once they're recorded, can make or break whether the project lands in the hands of the right label and management team. Lastly, we need video and promotional work to launch Johnny &amp; The Mongrels into the world with the most momentum possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Contributors will have the opportunity to obtains CDs, t-shirts, photo books, and other cool swag as well as several ""experience""-based perks such as getting a first-hand look at the mixing and mastering process. One lucky funder will get to curate a dream show as the band will perform a private gig and even get to introduce the band before they take the stage!</p></li>
<li><p>If we don't make our goal, your dollars will still go to securing time at the studio, mixing the album and promotion; the budget will just be adjusted down. If we bust over, we just have more time perfecting the mix!</p></li>
</ul><h2>The Impact</h2><p>By acting as a contributor to this project, you are directly supporting bringing music created by some of the most gargantuan players in today's music scene to life.</p><p>Whether you have been following Jeff Bostic for the better part of 2 decades, were moved by heartfelt songs written by Johnny Ryan, or just now found out Scott Sharrard was the mastermind behind The Gregg Allman Band and Eddie Christmas was the groove keeper on one of your favorite albums, there is something for everyone in Johnny &amp; The Mongrels.</p><p>The musical and professional standards of this project are set at the highest echelon and, in order to make sure this process is seen though 110%, we will need the help of our friends, family, and fans to chip in whatever they can to be present in this process. This music will not let you down and the band holds their fans and supporters in the highest regard and makes this music for YOU!</p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>The general public is often unaware of the time, energy and expenses that go into making a high-quality album. You need top-notch engineers, producers, management, labels, photographers/videographers, publicists, etc to utilize all resources and to make sure the project is the best-oiled machine on the market!</p><p>Here are an example of some of the expenses:</p><ul>
<li>$10,000 - Recording at Dockside Studios &amp; Mixing with Justin Tocket (Marc Broussard, Anders Osborne, Marcia Ball)</li>
<li>$2,000 - Mastering By Grammy-winning engineer David Glasser (Grateful Dead, Hot Tuna, Leftover Salmon) </li>
<li>$10,000 - Two video shoots ($5,000 each)</li>
<li>$5,000 - Tour promotion.</li>
</ul><p>It is also time-consuming and difficult to coordinate the schedules of all these full-time, working musicians who do nothing but eat, sleep, write, create, and breathe music, so the limited time Johnny &amp; The Mongrels spend together needs to be spent wisely.</p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>We know times can be tough and money can be tight, so even if you can't chip in $5, please share this campaign on all social media outlets and help us spread the word!</p><ul><li>Please  use the Indiegogo share tools at the top of this page!

Bruce Hampton, Warren Haynes and Gov't Mule, Phil Lesh, and many others.     Returning to Colorado in 2000, Bill joined Leftover Salmon, recording, touring, and performing with them for the next 10 years. During this time, he also created his own band, Bill McKay Band, pursued many opportunities to play solo piano, and recorded and performed all over the musical map, with too many wonderful musicians to list here!    Throughout his entire life and career, Bill and his brother John have recorded, toured, and performed as the McKay Brothers. This is a special and meaningful project that showcases the brilliant songwriting of John McKay, as well as Bill's originals and a vast assortment of blues, folk and country music.     These days, in addition to Bill McKay Band, McKay Brothers, and multiple freelance projects, Bill plays solo piano, and regular gigs with the True Blue Band and Brother's Keeper. Proud to be a part of the Colorado music scene for 25 years, Bill McKay keeps moving forward in his pursuit of musical adventure!Bill has recently begun working with Chris Thompson's longstanding musical project Coral Creek. in addition to performing and recording with this killer jamgrass outfit, Coral Creek Music offers opportunities for promotion and distribution of Bills new recordings; Which will now also include his much anticipated stint with Johnny & The Mongrels!Meet The TeamJoe MichaelsJoe Michaels has been working in the Music industry since 1969. Most of his career has been spent as a live sound engineer working with iconic bands including Rolling Stones, Blood Sweat and Tears, Larry Graham, James Brown, and the Kinks. Later in life, he moved into the studio producing records. Joe started Snapped on the River Music in 2003 when he started his studio work. Since it's inception, his clients have included Ivan Neville, Shaun Murphy, Bobby Messano, Bob Malone, Deanna Bogart and many more. ""I produced Blues Blast Magazines ""Best Contemporary CD of 2012"" for Shaun Murphy. My collaboration and production on Deanna Bogart's cover of Sly Stone's ""Hot Fun in the Summertime"" was named one of USA Today's ""Top Ten Songs of Summer.""Michaels specializes in working with established musicians who have been doing the same music for a long time. ""I take them out of their comfort zone, often putting them with other players they have never worked with and give them a new direction. The result is always something new and different and often their best work in years if not their career.""On May 18th of this year, Joe Michaels celebrated his 50th year in music with a great concert thrown for him by many of the artists he's have worked for over his career.Jim MimnaJim Mimna is a freelance photographer/videographer based near Denver, CO. He shoots a wide variety of subject matter like nature & wildlife, landscapes & remote location portrait work but his specialty is in concert photography/videography and band portraits. He has captured the images of some of the most influential, iconic artists of our time. From U2, Tom Petty & Neil Young to Widespread Panic, The Black Keys & Lorde just to scratch the surface. Mimna has established himself as the go-to photographer in an industry that has a truckload of qualified options. His incredible eye will be a crucial cog in the wheel of this campaign. Having unfortgettable images and video will inspire and document the passion and excitement of this project for years to come.Help us bring this incredible project to the world!
Launching a project like this is quite the endeavor. Getting time at the right studio, with the right musicians, engineers and producers is key to the vision and feel of the album. Additionally, the selection of where to mix and master the tracks (songs) once they're recorded, can make or break whether the project lands in the hands of the right label and management team. Lastly, we need video and promotional work to launch Johnny & The Mongrels into the world with the most momentum possible.
Contributors will have the opportunity to obtains CDs, t-shirts, photo books, and other cool swag as well as several ""experience""-based perks such as getting a first-hand look at the mixing and mastering process. One lucky funder will get to curate a dream show as the band will perform a private gig and even get to introduce the band before they take the stage!
If we don't make our goal, your dollars will still go to securing time at the studio, mixing the album and promotion; the budget will just be adjusted down. If we bust over, we just have more time perfecting the mix!
The ImpactBy acting as a contributor to this project, you are directly supporting bringing music created by some of the most gargantuan players in today's music scene to life.Whether you have been following Jeff Bostic for the better part of 2 decades, were moved by heartfelt songs written by Johnny Ryan, or just now found out Scott Sharrard was the mastermind behind The Gregg Allman Band and Eddie Christmas was the groove keeper on one of your favorite albums, there is something for everyone in Johnny & The Mongrels.The musical and professional standards of this project are set at the highest echelon and, in order to make sure this process is seen though 110%, we will need the help of our friends, family, and fans to chip in whatever they can to be present in this process. This music will not let you down and the band holds their fans and supporters in the highest regard and makes this music for YOU!Risks & ChallengesThe general public is often unaware of the time, energy and expenses that go into making a high-quality album. You need top-notch engineers, producers, management, labels, photographers/videographers, publicists, etc to utilize all resources and to make sure the project is the best-oiled machine on the market!Here are an example of some of the expenses:
$10,000 - Recording at Dockside Studios & Mixing with Justin Tocket (Marc Broussard, Anders Osborne, Marcia Ball)
$2,000 - Mastering By Grammy-winning engineer David Glasser (Grateful Dead, Hot Tuna, Leftover Salmon) 
$10,000 - Two video shoots ($5,000 each)
$5,000 - Tour promotion.
It is also time-consuming and difficult to coordinate the schedules of all these full-time, working musicians who do nothing but eat, sleep, write, create, and breathe music, so the limited time Johnny & The Mongrels spend together needs to be spent wisely.Other Ways You Can HelpWe know times can be tough and money can be tight, so even if you can't chip in $5, please share this campaign on all social media outlets and help us spread the word!Please  use the Indiegogo share tools at the top of this page! They make it easy for you to help tell the world!And that's all there is to it. Thanks so much from Johnny, Jeff, Scott and Joe",8.0,0,"1 Campaign
