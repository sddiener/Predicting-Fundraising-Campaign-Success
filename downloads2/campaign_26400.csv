Also Y-ons in the high-Y core would diffuse outward to the inner low-Y shell, and this inner low-Y shell would also receive an inward directed Y-on flux from the adjacent second shell which would maintain a high-Y concentration. The diffusive flux vector for these radial fluxes would be highest between the core and its adjacent inner shell, and it is here where vortical movement of the diffusive fluxes would be most likely to first develop.

The role of today’s young people is striking: their engagement, their will to solve global challenges even if they don’t have the knowledge and the experience of the adults.We want to reach out to all young people, including those facing extreme hardship: refugees, survivors of human trafficking, those managing health-related challenges. Through our activities, we will encourage them to re-build their link to the society, and not simply survive but thrive in the  life that they choose.We are four professionals with diverse backgrounds. We got together about a year ago, in Brussels, Belgium. Each one of us had just made a professional life change. Each one was looking for a way to pursue a cause and a dream, while building on their previous professional background: life coaching, diplomacy, project management, international development, theater, sales, and European integration.Being convinced Europeans, we took seriously the available social research, according to which Europeans score less on soft skills : Teenagers across the EU can do better on key skills like teamwork. We recognize the real need to bring transversal and transferable skills to our youth so that they succeed in their quests today and thrive later, as adults and professionals, on a par with their peers world-wide. Therefore, we started U Thrive Europe. We developed a set of interdisciplinary trainings, based on an all-inclusive concept: one gets to know and manage her/himself and their social relationships (through the training in Emotional Intelligence); one learns to be creative and relate to their immediate social environment (through a course in improvisational theater); and one learns to analyse, make informed choices, convince others, and lead (through a communication/debate training).With us, today’s young people don’t have to wait for tomorrow, when they get a job, to acquire these soft skills through at-work training, coaching and team-buildings. They will start to build these skills earlier – in their formative years. This is, in fact, the right time when they must acquire them to internalise them easier, and deeper.Today’s fast paced technological progress brings many new jobs; more traditional, known professions seize to exist. So how can the youth today prepare for jobs that don’t exist? What disciplines to study, what skills to acquire?  Scientific and policy research shows that one solution is to train the young people in so-called transferable and transversal skills – they can  be adapted to different personal and professional paths, including to those that we may not know about just yet. Our trainings will help the young people to develop exactly this kind of ‘soft’ skills.Crowdfunding will help us to – start up.We need to gather an initial pool of funding.We will use it to:
Find our audience, ‘place ourselves on the map’ of youth services and activities.
Cover the expenses related to the establishment and the initial reach-out of our non-profit.
Build ‘channels of distribution’ of our services. We plan for three such channels: online courses, extracurricular activities for secondary schools (on-site, with an online option as a back-up) and own physical classes in a venue tailored to the needs and interests of teenagers.
We already have one client and are actively working on our online training module.          We aim to gather 10 000 EUR. These will help us cover costs related to:
the legal and fiscal registration of our non-profit organisation, under the legislation of the Kingdom of Belgium
the preparation of branding and marketing materials
developing our presence in the social media – indispensable if we are to reach out to the contemporary young people, and to make it easier for youth in distress to reach us
developing our capacity to teach online: crucial if we are to conduct our trainings in COVID and quarantine-ridden times, when the young people may need us to be there for them even more than in healthy times.
If the campaign gathers more funds than expected, the outstanding resources will be used to organise our first training for underprivileged youth. Finally, we would also like to compensate symbolically the young volunteers who have been part of this crowdfunding campaign and those who have been working on the pre-registration phase of our organisation.If we do not manage to gather the targeted EUR 10K, your support will not be wasted! We will prioritise the elements that allow our initiative to move forward and reach the young people faster, namely the online training capacity and the presence in social media.Yes, like many people, we want to ‘save  the world’. In our case – by helping as many young people as we can to get today the skills they need - now and tomorrow.The so-called soft skills, or transversal and transferable skills, have been widely recognized as instrumental to the professional success in 21st century.

<p>As a contribution to the important global reflective process
of the Commission on the Status of Women meeting at the United Nations in New York from
March 9-20<sup>th</sup> 2015, the Riverside Coalition (a progressive faith-based gathering) is inviting four women
leaders from very different backgrounds and experiences, to share their positions
on why two separate movements, fighting against gender and LGBT inequality,
need to work more closely together to achieve their missions. </p>
<p>Composed of several major ecumenical and faith traditions,
the Riverside Coalition is seeking to build deeper dialogue on the intersection
of health, education and business development with gender and LGBT equality. Both
movements have been challenged in recent years with a backlash from religious
conservative organizations and denominations/ International progress on the
alleviation of extreme poverty cannot go forward without a clearly articulated
counter-narrative that integrates faith values with the human rights agenda.
More recently, moves to redefine the family and “traditional values” at the
United Nations have caused more polarization on previously agreed strategies to
give more access to women to reproductive rights and remove constitutional and
legal barriers in 80 countries which perpetuate stigma and discrimination
against LGBT people and women and girls. Without some agreement around values
and outcomes, these legal and cultural barriers, often supported by religious
understanding of gender and sexual roles and beliefs, will continue to be a
stumbling block to progress on achieving many of the outcomes in the spirit of
the Millennium Development Goals and the ability to include important issues in
the development of their successors, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).
</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Why is this an important gathering?</h3>
<p>Twenty years on from the groundbreaking meeting in Beijing, the Commission offers a global opportunity to see how the human family is treating its daughter's, wives and grandmothers. Every cry we hear is a cry of the future.<br/></p>
<p>It is important to give people of faith an opportunity to build connections between women's and LGBT - and the wider issues of access to health, business opportunities and ending all forms of violence and discrimination. Four women will be invited to attend many of the events and networking opportunities as well as build long term support for their extraordinary programs. The long term goal of this project is to create a new pool of expertise to confront religious extremism with tangible workable models of economic empowerment and equal access for LGBT people and women. We need the funds to assist the Coalition and international guests to travel to New York, provide hospitality and introductions to additional supporters while educating us on the issues they face every day. How are religious institutions supporting their missions and how are they hindrances?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>A Public Witness</b></p>

On Friday March 13th, the Riverside Coalition will host a
panel discussion at the Riverside Church entitled “<i>Women of Faith, Women of Doubt</i>”. The four panelists will be sharing
insights into their work on building support and collaboration between LGBT and
gender equality issues in four different contexts and will open up the panel
presentations to the CSW delegation and public at large. The four panelists
are:

<p><b>Maxensia Nakibuuka</b>
is a community activist living with HIV from Kampala Uganda. She has served as
a local political leader and is Chair of the Council of the Laity in the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala. In 2012, she was one of 500 civil society
representatives at the UN to discuss the future global AIDS plan and has spoken
about the effects of criminalization of people with HIV and LGBT and other
vulnerable and populations. She has spoken at panels at CSW on the importance
of community health home based care for women and at the World Bank on the need
for collaboration at the grass roots level for all women – transgender, bisexual
and lesbian and straight women. She is developing an important economic model
involving a gay/straight alliance in Kampala. In 2014, the Catholic Archbishop
invited her to head the Archdiocesan HIV programs and she will be presenting
both the positive effects of religious support for health and some of the
negative effects of religious discrimination.

</div><div>
<p>The Riverside Coalition intends to continue meeting and
providing whatever support we can to the development of a strong progressive
faith presence at the UN while supporting efforts of these courageous women on
the ground in Uganda, and Jamaica. We plan to produce a report for our
supporters and funders when the conferences are over.</p>
<p>Each presenter will also have time to develop a three year strategic plan with our network and to gain access to potential donors and supporters in favor of LGBT/Women's alliances.</p>
<p>International journalist Andy Kopsa is building community awareness for these cross cutting issues and panelists will be available to local and international media covering the event.</p>
<p>We hope these witnesses will encourage the UN on the journey for LGBT and gender equality and the situation in 80 countries where gender issues are criminalized (often through equal access for property rights for women and criminalization for same gender sexual conduct).<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Each one of these women takes an enormous personal risk, to their safety, their reputations and professional development when they speak or write about these issues. We show our solidarity and are inspired by their courage. Without more tangible economic and moral support from individual donors and supporters, their missions will remain on the margins of their countries and their voices diminished. Both LGBT and gender equality movements will continue to loose ground and support at the UN and there will be increasing pressure from conservative religious organizations to enforce the interpretation of holy texts and their gender roles on millions of people who may not share these precepts because of their own religious or ethical values. Women's Reproductive Rights can no longer be guaranteed as a given in these international conversations and often the same interpretations and imposition of religious tradition and law are increasingly being used against both LGBT and women. It is also important for women in differing cultures to be aware of the particular needs and suffering of lesbians and transgender women, as well as the increasing persecution and stigma experienced by heterosexual women allies.<br/><br/>We see this three week experience as the beginning of an important educational process and we need the resources to make sure it happens and there will be follow up and additional opportunities to continue the dialogue and partnerships.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>If you cannot financially support this project, please share this appeal with your friends, faith communities and on your social media networks.<br/>Pay attention to the news during the Commission on the Status of Women and offer appropriate responses to media coverage and to your elected officials on what you are hearing, reading and seeing. The erosion of human rights under the disguise of religious freedom or cultural values needs to be stopped and called what is really is - sectarianism, sexism and homophobia. Be a part of the change and support the work of the Riverside Coalition.<br/></div>","A Short Summary

counter-narrative that integrates faith values with the human rights agenda.
More recently, moves to redefine the family and “traditional values” at the
United Nations have caused more polarization on previously agreed strategies to
give more access to women to reproductive rights and remove constitutional and
legal barriers in 80 countries which perpetuate stigma and discrimination
against LGBT people and women and girls. Without some agreement around values
and outcomes, these legal and cultural barriers, often supported by religious
understanding of gender and sexual roles and beliefs, will continue to be a
stumbling block to progress on achieving many of the outcomes in the spirit of
the Millennium Development Goals and the ability to include important issues in
the development of their successors, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).


  Why is this an important gathering?
Twenty years on from the groundbreaking meeting in Beijing, the Commission offers a global opportunity to see how the human family is treating its daughter's, wives and grandmothers. Every cry we hear is a cry of the future.
It is important to give people of faith an opportunity to build connections between women's and LGBT - and the wider issues of access to health, business opportunities and ending all forms of violence and discrimination. Four women will be invited to attend many of the events and networking opportunities as well as build long term support for their extraordinary programs. The long term goal of this project is to create a new pool of expertise to confront religious extremism with tangible workable models of economic empowerment and equal access for LGBT people and women. We need the funds to assist the Coalition and international guests to travel to New York, provide hospitality and introductions to additional supporters while educating us on the issues they face every day. How are religious institutions supporting their missions and how are they hindrances?


A Public Witness

On Friday March 13th, the Riverside Coalition will host a
panel discussion at the Riverside Church entitled “Women of Faith, Women of Doubt”. The four panelists will be sharing
insights into their work on building support and collaboration between LGBT and
gender equality issues in four different contexts and will open up the panel
presentations to the CSW delegation and public at large. The four panelists
are:

Maxensia Nakibuuka
is a community activist living with HIV from Kampala Uganda. She has served as
a local political leader and is Chair of the Council of the Laity in the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala. In 2012, she was one of 500 civil society
representatives at the UN to discuss the future global AIDS plan and has spoken
about the effects of criminalization of people with HIV and LGBT and other
vulnerable and populations. She has spoken at panels at CSW on the importance
of community health home based care for women and at the World Bank on the need
for collaboration at the grass roots level for all women – transgender, bisexual
and lesbian and straight women. She is developing an important economic model
involving a gay/straight alliance in Kampala. In 2014, the Catholic Archbishop
invited her to head the Archdiocesan HIV programs and she will be presenting
both the positive effects of religious support for health and some of the
negative effects of religious discrimination. 


Andy Kopsa is a freelance investigative reporter based in New York City. She has written for Al Jazeera, The Atlantic, Talking Points Memo, The Nation, Ms. magazine, and many other publications. She was awarded a 2012 Society of Professional Journalists Award for investigative reporting and was a 2013 recipient of a Knight Grant for Reporting on Religion in American Public Life from USC Annenberg.  Andy has done extensive work reporting on LGBT and women's rights issues internationally especially Sub-Saharan Africa as well as throughout the United States.  Andy has done extensive research and reporting on the US Government funding anti-gay and anti-women's rights groups and has spoken at several conferences and consulted with many human rights groups on the subject.  
Angeline Cecelia
Jackson is Executive Director of Quality of Citizenship Jamaica and remains
one of five open lesbians in the whole of Jamaica. She has spoken at the World
Bank about issues affecting women and LBT women in particular –the focus of her
organization. She has a strong religious background but the current attitudes
of religious leaders in Jamaica has made it very difficult for her to support
any particular religious tradition or denomination. 
Dr. S. N. Nyeck is
Assistant Professor at Clarkson University, Potsdam New York. She had to seek
political asylum in the USA following a legal battle in Cameroon where she was publicly
outed as a lesbian and subsequently had to flee for her safety. Some of the
earliest formulations of LGBT identity and news from Cameroon on the
underground LGBT movement came from Sybille’s writings and experience. 
Dr. Nyeck is a graduate of Swarthmore College and holds a
Ph.D. in political science from the University of California Los Angeles. She
is interested in comparative analysis of government contracts with particular
focus is on theorizing and modeling the intersection of law, politics, and
human agency in the public sector. Dr. Nyeck is the founder of Africa’s Public Procurement and
Entrepreneurship Research Initiative (www.apperi.org) and the co-editor of
Sexual Diversity in Africa: Theory, Politics, and Citizenship (McGill-Queen’s
University Press 2013). She received the Ruskin Prize and many awards for
highest academic achievements including the title of a Distinguished Alumna of
the City University of New York, The Pat Hussain Justice Award, and The Edward
Said /Audre Lorde Scholar Activism Award.

The Panel will be Moderated by Rev. Canon Albert Ogle, President of the St Paul's Foundation for International Reconciliation, who has worked in all of the countries represented by the panelists. 

A reception in honor of the international guests will be held at the Riverside Church and funds raised will also go towards covering the costs of the reception and this intensive two week networking opportunity.
Please reserve your ticket(s) for this limited event and reception sponsored by St. Paul's Foundation, the Riverside Church, Unitarian Universalist UN Office, Muslims for Progressive Values and The Presbyterian Church's UN Mission.http://www.eventbrite.com/o/hosts-st-pauls-foundation-the-riverside-church-maranatha-unitarian-universalist-uno-office-presbyterian-office-at-the-un-muslims-for-progressive-values-6474062413?s=34423788
The Impact

The Riverside Coalition intends to continue meeting and
providing whatever support we can to the development of a strong progressive
faith presence at the UN while supporting efforts of these courageous women on
the ground in Uganda, and Jamaica. We plan to produce a report for our
supporters and funders when the conferences are over.
Each presenter will also have time to develop a three year strategic plan with our network and to gain access to potential donors and supporters in favor of LGBT/Women's alliances.
International journalist Andy Kopsa is building community awareness for these cross cutting issues and panelists will be available to local and international media covering the event.
We hope these witnesses will encourage the UN on the journey for LGBT and gender equality and the situation in 80 countries where gender issues are criminalized (often through equal access for property rights for women and criminalization for same gender sexual conduct).

  Risks & ChallengesEach one of these women takes an enormous personal risk, to their safety, their reputations and professional development when they speak or write about these issues. We show our solidarity and are inspired by their courage. Without more tangible economic and moral support from individual donors and supporters, their missions will remain on the margins of their countries and their voices diminished. Both LGBT and gender equality movements will continue to loose ground and support at the UN and there will be increasing pressure from conservative religious organizations to enforce the interpretation of holy texts and their gender roles on millions of people who may not share these precepts because of their own religious or ethical values. Women's Reproductive Rights can no longer be guaranteed as a given in these international conversations and often the same interpretations and imposition of religious tradition and law are increasingly being used against both LGBT and women. It is also important for women in differing cultures to be aware of the particular needs and suffering of lesbians and transgender women, as well as the increasing persecution and stigma experienced by heterosexual women allies.We see this three week experience as the beginning of an important educational process and we need the resources to make sure it happens and there will be follow up and additional opportunities to continue the dialogue and partnerships.
  Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot financially support this project, please share this appeal with your friends, faith communities and on your social media networks.Pay attention to the news during the Commission on the Status of Women and offer appropriate responses to media coverage and to your elected officials on what you are hearing, reading and seeing. The erosion of human rights under the disguise of religious freedom or cultural values needs to be stopped and called what is really is - sectarianism, sexism and homophobia.

<b>Why it Matters (The Impact)</b><br/>There are thousands of children in Sierra Leone and millions more around the world that lack access to a quality education. We see the 'Login Promise Project' as an exciting opportunity opening up to use affordable technology to link these children with the great educational materials that are available freely online and a chance to connect with students around the world.

None of the world's problems (ranging from climate change, the environment, education to human rights) can be solved in one fell swoop. But by investing in the education of the future of humanity, we increase the chances that tomorrow's adults have the tools to solve those problems effectively.



Kofi Annan and Jeff Sachs at a Millennium Village  with their XOs and showing them off in support of innovative education for children 


The Ebola Crisis You DIDN'T Hear About: 'Education'. Have you ever imagined about what the life is like for the over 4 thousand Sierra kids who don't have Ebola, but whose lives have been turned upside down by the Ebola Epidemic? The defeat of Ebola means Education over Ebola, for Education is that which liberates.


What we needLogin Promise: Our goal is to deliver innovative education to Sierra Leone children  whose schools were hampered and who are made orphans as a result of the effects of the Ebola outbreak. We’re a non-profit organization bringing free digital educational content to the world’s underprivileged children through community access ICT centres where they can learn skills, grow their minds and share their stories to the world. 
Login promise will provide educational opportunities Sierra Leone children affected  by Ebola by bringing free digital educational content to the world’s underprivileged children.  Login Promise will also  be replicated in Liberia and Guinea in the near future. We are targeting 1600 kids in  Sierra Leone develop technological and life skills. The project is an appropriate intervention at this time.There will be ICT teachers who will help to mentor children and train them in the use of their new gadgets for educational purposes. The training will help in sustainable  innovative education and social progress of the children and add value to their lives, paving a way to a national innovation education drive.

The Cost

The program will involve the setting up of two B-Gifted Information Communication Technology (ICT) access centers for children and will be equipped with computers, scanners, printers, chairs tables,  which involves 30 workstations at a cost of $26,500 for each ICT centre which makes a sub- total of $53,000

Training, materials and administrative cost is $12,000 which adds up to $65,000

B-Gifted will cover the configuration and analytics costs for each computers
A private donor has agreed to pay for shipping
And because private donors cover our R&D and tech development costs, public donations go entirely 100% to expanding our field work

We will issue tax receipts for donations

MAKE IT A GIFT: Donate support to #LoginPromise in someone's honor, and we'll give them the perks, put their name on the devices, and tell them about your generous gesture. Just email b.giftedfoundation@gmail.com if you want to do this. 








Proof of Impact

""B-Gifted Foundation has been a powerful organization for change especially for children in  fragile educational system.  From my experience since I started working with the children with B-Gifted, children have been greatly encouraged to learn and be come innovative thinkers and also helping freely to create their dreams. They are a shining example of the hope that education brings - (Maxwell Adew) B-Gifted Consultant.
""ICT Community Access centres will continue to become the principal information and educational window to our community's children impacted by the Ebola."" Martin Kailie MPhil, (B-Gifted Associate).

It will be a great advantage for education in emergencies and a huge success for children to leapfrog the personal huddles of lack of access to educational materials by introducing innovative ICT programs and reach many children. This will be a remarkable positive reach to children who will be excited and overwhelmed by this program and who can no longer wait to get themselves fully engaged by encouraging the  children affected by Ebola outbreak to have access to the internet and educational materials. The children will login and communicate to other children around the world on relevant social issues which are affecting them. They will learn from other cultures and share their experiences with students in far away countries in a cross-cultural edifying exchange of ideas. They will even engage in a global classroom in which they will pose questions to teachers in the global classroom. B-Gifted hope to continue the campaign long after the Ebola crises to enable innovative education to continue in positively transforming lives in the small West African country that has been scarred by war and Ebola. (Andrew Benson Greene) when he was summoned
as  Guest Speaker during the International Student Conference
""Education Without Borders 2007'. Abu Dhabi UAE



Why it Matters (The Impact)There are thousands of children in Sierra Leone and millions more around the world that lack access to a quality education. We see the 'Login Promise Project' as an exciting opportunity opening up to use affordable technology to link these children with the great educational materials that are available freely online and a chance to connect with students around the world. B-Gifted foundation believes that education is a human right and technology can be used as a means not an end.
What our organization has done so farThe organization www.b-gifted.org has successfully implemented projects that have indeed served the common good and this project will further expand on those gains. With the significant experience of staff in the field as well as successful track record, and previous recognition like the Pan African Awards for entrepreneurship in Education and the ITU Telecom Awards, we hope to succeed.

My organization continues to develop new ways for youth to cope with the effects of war and diseases through overcoming barriers of communication between youth in conflict and conflict-free zones. Some of my newest programs help youth communicate about and overcome the tragedies of war through art, creative writing, music recording and video production. I have been asked to travel to over 26 countries to present on my groundbreaking approach by not only rehabilitating children from war, but also providing training in 21st century skills that the former child soldiers and amputee victims will be able to use to create a stable and peaceful society.
 My Story.

Founder with children in SIERRA LEONE donating Teddy bears to kids at the amputee camps for the show some love project

Charles F. Harper, Director of Outreach at the MY HERO Project in the summer of 2002 has this to say about  Andrew and his education and peace work when Andgrew got selected as My Hero in the My Hero Project.
""Now, if there was ever anyone who had reason to be resentful, despairing, and bitter, it is Andrew. Raised in a country that was divided by the violence of civil war, where brother fought against brother and sister against sister, and children were recruited to do horrific acts of violence for the self-interests of greedy leaders, he watched as an entire international community ignored the pains and struggles of his fellow countrymen as if they were not even a blip on the international radar screen.


He could easily have chosen the path of blaming others for the tragic circumstances of his country and the impossibilities of educating himself and the young people around him. He could have wallowed in self-pity, never moving a muscle to rebuild a destitute country. He could have clung to the status quo of survival for survival's sake. Instead, Andrew chose the road less traveled.
When you meet Andrew you get to know someone who is at peace with himself and the world. There is a serenity in his presence. And the serenity comes from Andrew having the courage and the faith to nurture the gifts and talents he has as an educator and to share those talents and gifts with all who come within the universe of his indomitable spirit. That serene smile comes from not believing but knowing that one step, one day at a time, his children's children will experience the impossible possibility of peace, justice and freedom from the scars of war.""

<p>Pathfinders Ranch is a
small residential treatment center located in Driftwood, TX. We are a
non-profit organization that serves boys who have experienced severe trauma due
to abuse and neglect. As a result, these children are unable to manage
the stressors of day to day life, and are unable to experience a normal childhood.
They lead transient lives, transitioned from place
to place, never developing meaningful, lasting or nurturing relationships with
adults. For these young boys there was no light at the end of the tunnel.
</p>
<p>In 1973 Pathfinders opened
its doors with a mission to promote healing and hope in a safe, nurturing
environment, to promote healthy relationships and mentoring. To help these
young boys build self-esteem, viable skills and pro-social behaviors. For
however long we are blessed with their presence, we strive to teach these
children that there are adults they can trust, that there are safe places in
this world and that they can accomplish whatever they set their minds to.</p>
<p>Pathfinders Ranch sits on 25 acres with 100 year old stone buildings.  There are separate school buildings, office buildings, living quarters, and social and meal buildings and camping areas in the far back part of the property.  We currently are using our personal cell phones to contact each other.  As you can imagine, cell services can be hit or miss out here. The boys and their counselors are never all in the same place, and rarely near the main office where visitors check in.  <strong>We really need two way-radios.</strong>  Not only will they provide better, more efficient communication between the office and staff, but will also allow for urgent or emergency communications between staff who are also spread out across the property with different groups of boys.  As you might imagine with a 501(c)3 non-profit, all available funding goes to provide for our boys, and not much is left over for things like this.  </p>
<p>The $500 being requested will allow us to purchase 10 two-way radios, the base chargers, ear pieces, backup batteries, and the required FCC license.  Should we not get all of the funding requested, we will buy fewer radios, as many as can be purchased with whatever we receive.  Thank you for your consideration.</p>

</div><p>Thank for your support, whatever your choice may be. </p><p>Onlangs ben ik afgestudeerd als being in balance coach.  Being in Balance® wordt door velen beschouwt als een van de krachtigste coachingsvormen die op dit moment in de wereld beschikbaar zijn. Geen coaching vorm ter wereld gaat zo snel naar de essentie en is zo goed meetbaar op effectiviteit, zelfs tot op DNA niveau. </p><p>Being in Balance® richt zich met zeer geavanceerde technologie, via een body-mind scan van maximaal 10 minuten snel op de kern van de zaak. Gewoon met je kleding aan worden er zo 90 miljard punten in je lijf gemeten. Zo ontstaat er in korte tijd een nauwkeurig beeld over waar je in balans bent en waar mogelijk niet. </p><p>Daarmee helpen we kinderen, volwassenen en professionals effectief op individuele basis door het vinden en doorbreken van belemmerende patronen en innerlijke saboteurs. We creëren in korte tijd een verhoogd bewustzijn en activeren bronnen voor een betere balans en prestatie. Op deze manier bereiken we gemiddeld een stressreductie van 40% en bereik je op een versnelde manier jouw ‘next level’ van prestatie, geluk  en vitaliteit.</p><div>

</p><ul>
<li>90 billion
     measuring points in your body. </li>
<li>State-of-the-art
     technology! Designed on the basis of the biophotons measurement.</li>
<li>The
Technology deliver detailed illustrations and a good visualisation.</li>
<li>The technology can support me as a coach in preparing a therapy regime, you quickly discover the core of your mental case to mak a hugh step in happiness.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Every body cell is built like a hyper sensitive antenna.</strong> It receives information from its environment and passes these on again. Without this exchange of information there would be no life on earth. Biophotons control this flow of information. Those are measurable as a noise field which surrounds the body (often also referred to as aura). The cells virtually work together like a big orchestra: every cell sends out oscillations (sound) which altogether build up a melody. The more damaged a cell is, the less information it has and the more disharmonious is its sound and the less its sound fits the melody.  <br/><p></p><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> </div><p>The money will be spent for the purchase of the Oberon Pathfinder technology worth 30,000 euros. I'll lease the technology for a few years. After that I hope to be able to pay the remaining amount. </p><p>The perks that I offer are amazing for you. They will help you grown to a higher level of health and consciousness. It's amazing what this technology can do. </p><p>Already the ancient Chinese said: “Life is an oscillation around the inner centre” and Albert Einstein stated: “Each aspect of life is oscillation”. Every human being, every animal, every stone, every organ, every cell, every cell nucleus, every bacterium and every virus has an optimal harmonious oscillation. This natural oscillation is physically measurable. The OBERON System capitalises on this knowledge. </p><div> </div><ul> </ul><p>If I do not Achieve my goal, I will lease the technology and i will work hard to be able to acquire the technology and thus help children and adults to be healthier and more positive in life. </p><div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Oberon Pathfinder is an incredible, creative and innovative technology, made by<a href=""http://www.metavital.eu/index.php?id=3&amp;L=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u> Metavital</u></a>. The Oberon system is a naturopatic diagnostic system with makes use of the non linear system analysis (NLS). It is cerrificated according tot the German Medical Device Act (MPG) and designed for  the alternative medicine. It is an ideal link for us between the thousand of years old Eastern art of healing and the modern naturopathy. </p>
<p>I tested a couple of times in practice, during my being in balance coach education, and it delivers amazing results. </p>
<p>The technology looks at the whole person (physical, emotional, mental and spiritual) and is able to level essentially to identify the root causes of imbalance and help these recover. </p>
<p>The technology is the result of over 50 years of Science research. The fact that this technology is now also available for children, adults and professionals is very valuable. </p>
<p>A total of 90 billion points are measured in the body. During the measurement the recorded measurements are mathematically compared with a database of over 30,000 frequency patterns intertwined with each other. The interpretation and analysis of the curves, text and energy values you learn as a Coach quickly come to the crux of the matter and directed to intervene in the main ""levers"": the 20% that determines 80% of the result.</p>
<p>A vast scientific literature has detailed how negative emotions harm the body. Serious, sustained stress or fear can alter biological systems in a way that, over time, adds up to “wear and tear” and, eventually, illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. This technology has a preventive starting point. </p>
<p>Very effective for coaching sessions for individuals, but also for groups. For instance: children gain more strength, self assurance and balance at school. Or employees who are now able to measure, optimize and improve each of the metrics so that they can be happy as possible. Employees who are in balance are happier and also more productive, that's been proven many times, so it's important that leaders try their best to make sure every employee is in balance and happy as possible. If you want to improve your happiness and wellbeing levels, this technology is for you. </p>

<p>Every body cell is built like a hyper sensitive antenna. It receives information from its environment and passes these on again.

The cells virtually work together like a big orchestra: every cell sends out oscillations (sound) which altogether build up a melody. The more damaged a cell is, the less information it has and the more disharmonious is its sound and the less its sound fits the melody. You go so quickly to the heart of the matter.</p>

I believe that everyone deserves to be happy and healthy. It's my mission to bring people at a higher level of consciousness and closer to the laws of human nature for a significant improvement on health, happiness and wellbeing. To realize my mission: Ik wil mij graag even voorstellen. Mijn naam is Sheila Neijman, oprichtster van Heart4happiness. Mijn missie is global happiness: volwassenen en kinderen naar een hoger geluksbewustzijn brengen met een significante verbetering op gezondheid, geluk en vitaliteit. Om mijn missie vorm te geven heb ik jou hulp nodig. 

I need your support! 
I want to emphasize the importance of emotional and health metrics to achieve my goal. The science behind it, developed a sophisticated technology, that has a huge effect on people happiness, health and wellbeing. For me it's time to start right now. Have you ever dreamed about a unique and highly advantage scan for a totally body and mind experience? To reduce stress and increase an overall feeling of happiness? Now it's possible! 
Without your support I can’t start working with this amazing technology: ""The Oberon pathfinder"". I have been working hard to educate myself in training with the technology. Now I am a licensed trainer and need your help to purchase the Oberon Pathfinder to be able to integrate it's incredible techniques into my work, and re-introduce positivity into peoples lives from an amazing new level. It’s that simple! How can you support me?

You can help me by posting this project on Social Media.
You can deposit an amount.
Or you can do both:-)

Thank for your support, whatever your choice may be. Onlangs ben ik afgestudeerd als being in balance coach.  Being in Balance® wordt door velen beschouwt als een van de krachtigste coachingsvormen die op dit moment in de wereld beschikbaar zijn. Geen coaching vorm ter wereld gaat zo snel naar de essentie en is zo goed meetbaar op effectiviteit, zelfs tot op DNA niveau. Being in Balance® richt zich met zeer geavanceerde technologie, via een body-mind scan van maximaal 10 minuten snel op de kern van de zaak. Gewoon met je kleding aan worden er zo 90 miljard punten in je lijf gemeten. Zo ontstaat er in korte tijd een nauwkeurig beeld over waar je in balans bent en waar mogelijk niet. Daarmee helpen we kinderen, volwassenen en professionals effectief op individuele basis door het vinden en doorbreken van belemmerende patronen en innerlijke saboteurs. We creëren in korte tijd een verhoogd bewustzijn en activeren bronnen voor een betere balans en prestatie. Op deze manier bereiken we gemiddeld een stressreductie van 40% en bereik je op een versnelde manier jouw ‘next level’ van prestatie, geluk  en vitaliteit.

The magnitude of what you as a contributor will help achieve




90 billion
     measuring points in your body. 
State-of-the-art
     technology! Designed on the basis of the biophotons measurement.
The
Technology deliver detailed illustrations and a good visualisation.
The technology can support me as a coach in preparing a therapy regime, you quickly discover the core of your mental case to mak a hugh step in happiness.

Every body cell is built like a hyper sensitive antenna. It receives information from its environment and passes these on again. Without this exchange of information there would be no life on earth. Biophotons control this flow of information. Those are measurable as a noise field which surrounds the body (often also referred to as aura). The cells virtually work together like a big orchestra: every cell sends out oscillations (sound) which altogether build up a melody. The more damaged a cell is, the less information it has and the more disharmonious is its sound and the less its sound fits the melody.     What We Need & What You Get The money will be spent for the purchase of the Oberon Pathfinder technology worth 30,000 euros. I'll lease the technology for a few years. After that I hope to be able to pay the remaining amount. The perks that I offer are amazing for you. They will help you grown to a higher level of health and consciousness. It's amazing what this technology can do. Already the ancient Chinese said: “Life is an oscillation around the inner centre” and Albert Einstein stated: “Each aspect of life is oscillation”. Every human being, every animal, every stone, every organ, every cell, every cell nucleus, every bacterium and every virus has an optimal harmonious oscillation. This natural oscillation is physically measurable. The OBERON System capitalises on this knowledge.   If I do not Achieve my goal, I will lease the technology and i will work hard to be able to acquire the technology and thus help children and adults to be healthier and more positive in life.    The Impact
The Oberon Pathfinder is an incredible, creative and innovative technology, made by Metavital. The Oberon system is a naturopatic diagnostic system with makes use of the non linear system analysis (NLS). It is cerrificated according tot the German Medical Device Act (MPG) and designed for  the alternative medicine. It is an ideal link for us between the thousand of years old Eastern art of healing and the modern naturopathy. 
I tested a couple of times in practice, during my being in balance coach education, and it delivers amazing results. 
The technology looks at the whole person (physical, emotional, mental and spiritual) and is able to level essentially to identify the root causes of imbalance and help these recover. 
The technology is the result of over 50 years of Science research. The fact that this technology is now also available for children, adults and professionals is very valuable. 
A total of 90 billion points are measured in the body. During the measurement the recorded measurements are mathematically compared with a database of over 30,000 frequency patterns intertwined with each other. The interpretation and analysis of the curves, text and energy values you learn as a Coach quickly come to the crux of the matter and directed to intervene in the main ""levers"": the 20% that determines 80% of the result.
A vast scientific literature has detailed how negative emotions harm the body. Serious, sustained stress or fear can alter biological systems in a way that, over time, adds up to “wear and tear” and, eventually, illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. This technology has a preventive starting point. 
Very effective for coaching sessions for individuals, but also for groups. For instance: children gain more strength, self assurance and balance at school. Or employees who are now able to measure, optimize and improve each of the metrics so that they can be happy as possible. Employees who are in balance are happier and also more productive, that's been proven many times, so it's important that leaders try their best to make sure every employee is in balance and happy as possible. If you want to improve your happiness and wellbeing levels, this technology is for you.

</b></u><u><b>I</b></u><u><b>niciative.</b></u></p>
<p>
RWI
is determined to reach our goals improving the lives of women and
through them their communities through education, training and
empowerment programs, one of the programs we would like to offer is a
course in ICT.(information computer technology) 
</p>
<p>
 We
currently lack the technological capacity to raise funds and bring
global and local attention to our worthy cause. 
</p>
<p>
We
need computers not only for the administration of the venture but
also as a means to provide a platform where we can teach women skills
in the use of computers and the internet as part of a sustainable
skill set they can use to improve their lives and employability in an
ever more technology driven world. 
</p>
<p>
ICTs
have been promoted by international organizations such as UNESCO, UN
WOMEN and the FAO as a poverty reduction strategy with the additional
benefit of empowering women in developing countries. 
</p>
<p>
<br/>Women's
access to ICTs is restricted in some countries. Low levels of
literacy, limited technological access, technical expertise and the
often poor infrastructure and high cost of connectivity in developing
nations, prevent many women from taking full advantage of the
opportunities offered by ICTs.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1226860/files/20150216173015-one_computer_10_kids.jpg?1424136615"" src="""" style=""width: 610.604166666667px; height: 530px;""/></p>We all want to learn but there's only one computer.<div>

<p>
KEA
has now been running a child sponsorship program since 2004. 
</p>
<p>
We
believe in child sponsorship because it connects people like you with
children that are miles away, and gives you the opportunity to
develop a unique personal relationship with your sponsor child.</p>
<p>
Each
sponsor child gets the opportunity to go to school, a new school
uniform, lunchtime meals where possible, exercise books and
stationary, and access to First Aid. You can sponsor a child in KEA
Green Hill Education Centre and give them a future today.

<p>
Beyond
that, there are no toys, no dolls, and no soccer balls, no sweets and
treats, at best, a bed of reeds to sleep on. 
</p>
<p>
School
would be wonderful to attend, the path out of poverty, but there is
no money for school fees, so you stay home and wait for a miracle,
but for most there is none, life is simply survival, staying
alive.<br/><br/>Death
is very common to you (20% of Ugandan children do not reach the age

<p>
So
here you are, a child in Kikandwa, living in a small house, made of
sun baked, mud bricks, covered by a corrugated tin roof (they are
called iron sheets here), that leaks whenever it rains. 
</p>
<p>
The
room is small, yes, the house is one room, and if you are really
lucky it will be two. No kitchen, you have a stove outside, a
charcoal one, charcoal costs about 7 dollars (£5) a bag and for some
that lasts all month. 
</p>
<p>
If
you have no money you find some wood and use a fire to cook over. The
bathroom, consists of an outhouse down the path, shared by many
families, there is a common one used by the men and by all to wash
in.</p>
<p>
Most
Ugandans bathe using plastic wash–tubs twice a day. A house like
that rents for 10 to 20 dollars a month in an urban center like
Kikandwa, and it is in slum areas of town. 
</p>
<p>
The
income of your parents is only about 40 dollars combined. Father
works on farm for a well to do family from 7 in the morning to 7
evening. Mother goes off at 6:30 in the morning to work as a maid for
someone in rich family and on farms.<br/><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You
are a girl of 12, and now you are home alone, well almost.</span><br/></p>
<p>
 Father
might sleep for a few hours, but then he is off into town seeing if
he can come up with some extra work and make a few more Shillings for
the family. 
</p>
<p>
Why
are you not in school? Oh, the answer to that one is easy, a girl
does not need school, she only needs to take care of the house, get a
husband when she is older, have babies, raise a family, cook, maybe
work as maid, or in a restaurant, but there is no reason to invest in
a woman or so the thinking goes. (Most of the lack of education for
girls has to do with economics, the firstborn boy is usually sent to
school if any money is available.)<br/><br/>Your oldest brother left at
7 that morning, he had to take a roll of toilet paper to school,
since the day before he was scolded for not having any. He also had
to take a new broom to class to sweep the classroom and the school
grounds after school.<br/><br/>School is expensive.</p>
<p>
A
new law had been passed in 1997 making Ugandan school free through
primary grades, but then there are all those other fees, such as PTA,
Building Funds, extra this and that. Besides school is six miles away
and the mini bus called taxi costs 50 cents each way. 
</p>
<p>
There
are the hidden costs that no one talks about at school, but are so
common.</p>
<p>
Class
size is often about 100 students to the room. 
</p>
<p>
Even
that is supposed to change but has not. Mother had to come up with
extra money so that your brother could pay the teacher to sit up at
the front of the class, where he could hear and learn better.</p>
<p>
Money
had also to be paid to have homework checked and corrected, and if
you wanted extra help called tutoring for the Primary 7 exam, there
was something extra for that. 
</p>
<p>
That
is why only one of your brothers goes to school, while the others
hang around until maybe some of the uncles and aunts in the family
can contribute something for the education of them.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">For
that is how it works in Uganda, no family can ever come up with the
money alone, it takes combined resources of the extended family to
send children to school in most cases.</span><br/></p>
<p>Daily, it is your job,
to look after the little ones. Do laundry in two plastic tubs with
water that you had to carry in a 5–gallon can up a hill to the
house. Not only washing, but there is cooking.</p>
<p>
You
do not have to worry about preparing meat, there is no money for
that, except a few times a month. The shop is just around the corner
from you. No, you can’t ask for a cut of meat, you get what is
there and the price is the same. You really do not care about that
chewy, tough meat anyway, plus it is covered with flies, yuck.<br/><br/>Live
chickens can be bought in the market, but they are expensive, costing
between four and five dollars. It is only on special occasions that
one will buy them, it is your job to kill and pluck clean if your
brothers are not around.</p>
<p>
The
main staple of Uganda is Matooke (green bananas, masked and steamed
under banana leaves) and Posho made from corn flour.</p>
<p>
Every
evening you buy a plastic sack of milk, for immediate consumption,
since it would spoil if you bought it during the day. It is sold
along the roads by vendors with carts, and if you pick one from the
bottom of the pile, it is still reasonably cool, well warm. 
</p>
<p>
Bread,
can also be bought there from the same roadside hawkers who call out
what they have for sale, as it gets dark small oil lamps illuminate
their wares.<br/><br/>In the mornings it is your job to head to the
market to buy stalks of bananas, some sweet potatoes if any money is
on hand. 
</p>
<p>
There
are also red kidney beans, but during the two rainy seasons of the
year they may be filled with maggots and you do not like getting your
meat and protein that way, but that is reality and what can one do.</p>
<p>
 Rice
is available but you have to pick the rocks out of it since it is no
fun chewing on them. It is also very expensive. There are potatoes
which you like and sometimes use when you buy beef, but it always
comes down to how much money the family has.<br/><br/>The future does
not look bright for you.</p>
<p>
You
hear people talking about things getting better, but you have not
seen it. Malaria still comes to visit you on a regular basis, there
is dysentery, cholera that one has to look out for, and as you have
gotten older and developed as a young woman has, there is the hidden
problem in Africa. 
</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Your
uncle has been coming around saying things to you, and suggesting
that you come to visit him and learn how to be a woman. Yes, things
are not getting better for you.</span><br/></p>
<p>It would be nice to learn how
to read and write, but it may never happen, in fact that are not many
in the family that do. 
</p>
<p>
There
are only two ways out of the slum in which you live. One is to get an
education and the other way is what your Aunt  is doing, selling
herself to White and Indian men who have money and just might take
you in as a live in girlfriend.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">That
however is not the way you learned in your church, just up the path
from your slum called Eden Revival where they spoke of Holiness,
right living and faith in God to bring about a future with hope. You
have had a lot of hope, prayed a lot, but not seen the bright future,
but then God must be busy in other parts of the world.</span><br/></p>
<p>You
like going into town with your mother to Kikandwa market where you
see clothes for sale, not that you get many, it has been some time
since you last gotten a new skirt, and the detergent had long ago
washed out all the brightness that had been there (Omo does get the
dirt out, but also the color). 
</p>
<p>You
reach down to scratch your feet, and notice that a few more jiggers
have lodged themselves there and it would be time again to cut them
out, since there was no money to go the doctor, and mother did a good
enough job with a knife.<br/><br/>Fun, for you was playing with other
children, going down to the place where the men drank out of common
pot the homebrew that some of the women prepared.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There
you could dance to drums with some the other girls. You liked it and
everyone would join in while the old men would talk about yesterday,
today and tomorrow, always looking for that miracle to help them out
of the slum.</span><br/></p>
<p>A new lottery had come to Kikandwa and Uncle
Stephen had taken all of his salary of 30 dollars, (30,000 shillings)
and bet it and won nothing in return. Others laughed about it but you
felt sorry for him.<br/><br/>There was something new you had heard
about. Kikandwa Environmental Association organization set up a
little office and temporary classes in Kasejjere community and was
signing up children to go to school without school fees. 
</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">They
also provided school uniforms, books, t and some food to most
vulnerable children. The cost would be paid for a by a family far
away and it was called sponsorship. Maybe, just maybe this was true
and someone did care about children like you maybe there was more to
life; maybe there would be a chance, an open door to have hope.
Maybe, someone did care. </span><br/></p>
<p>The reality is that you and I can
make the difference in the lives of children in Kikandwa. You can go
there like I and many others have done and actually work amongst
them, or you can contribute your money to an agency that will do so
on your behalf.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There
is a catch however.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Often
only a small portion can reach the child who really needs the help,
so one has to ask questions, such as how much of your money goes to
actually supporting your child? How much of it is used in
administration, fundraising and so on, goes toward the child and its
development in Uganda. which is why this campaign is so important to us </span><br/></p>

we are 


Rural
Women Initiative (RWI) is a charitable non-profit organization for
young women
and
mothers aged 12-35 years in rural communities.

Rural
Women Initiative was established in February 14th 2013
by 4 young
mothers with support of Kikandwa Environmental Association. In
response to the difficulties facing women and girls due to violence,
poverty and lack of education.
Our
mission is to
advocate
for gender
equality
appreciating
rural womens significance
in their community by empowering them economically through education
and health programs.Child marriage leads girls to become pregnant too early, drop out of school exposing them to HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality and a life of inescapable poverty.Women
can be the most important catalysts for change in their children’s
lives. By empowering women—through education, skills training,
improved healthcare, or providing skills
and resources to
set up a small business—we can improve children’s health,
education and future opportunities as
well as impact the wellbeing
of the entire community both economically and physically.



How
ICT (Information and Computer Technology) will assist Rural Womens
Iniciative.

RWI
is determined to reach our goals improving the lives of women and
through them their communities through education, training and
empowerment programs, one of the programs we would like to offer is a
course in ICT.(information computer technology) 


 We
currently lack the technological capacity to raise funds and bring
global and local attention to our worthy cause. 


We
need computers not only for the administration of the venture but
also as a means to provide a platform where we can teach women skills
in the use of computers and the internet as part of a sustainable
skill set they can use to improve their lives and employability in an
ever more technology driven world. 


ICTs
have been promoted by international organizations such as UNESCO, UN
WOMEN and the FAO as a poverty reduction strategy with the additional
benefit of empowering women in developing countries. 


Women's
access to ICTs is restricted in some countries. Low levels of
literacy, limited technological access, technical expertise and the
often poor infrastructure and high cost of connectivity in developing
nations, prevent many women from taking full advantage of the
opportunities offered by ICTs.We all want to learn but there's only one computer.
 Rural
Women Initiative (RWI) would like to reverse this situation in
Kikandwa Sub County. We are posting a campaign  to
fundraise US$10,000 (28749643.92UG) to buy equipment (computers,
modems and a printer as well as the ongoing cost of internet
connection of approximately US$100/month)in order to train women on
the positive use of ICT to develop their livelihoods. RWI will
partner with Kikandwa Environmental Association (KEA) to grant it
office space to house the computers.

The school
 Any
additional moneys collected will be put towards our other ventures
such as   KEA school,
orphanage, well building,
tree planting and agricultural work and workshops.


We
are asking for the sum of USD$10 000 




What your money will do:


$1
will plant 5 trees address climate change/soil erosion


$3
will support Doctors reaching homes to treat patients 



$5
will support a child and mother with HIV/AIDS with ARV”S or medical
care


$10
will train farmer in computers


$20
will train a farmer in agriculture


$25
will pay one month electricity


$30
will feed a person too elderly/infirm to work for one month


$20
will cover medical expenses of elderly/infirm for one month


$50
will Stock computer lab with ICT books and resources


$53
will will support a child at school with school fees and scholastic
materials


$60
will buy 1 modem


$65
will support the local trainer/teacher for one month 



$100
will support an orphan including food school medical 



$100
will pay for one month internet connection


$1000
will buy one computer package 



$1200
will pay to finish the well to be used by the community to save people
from  	walking 4km for water, the excess water after domestic use will be used for irrigating
the crops that 	feed 	the community.


Potable water for 500 people 4km walk away the road for women is full of danger.
We started digging the well by hand with funds raised by the community will you help us?




What
do we do?

RWI
works in rural communities that are affected by socio-economic
constraints which forces parents to send female children into early
marriage exposing them to risks of HIV /AIDS maternal mortality and a
life of inescapable poverty.

THANK YOU!!


In case you are still reading and would like to know more about the school and life in Uganda.
A word from our Director and Executive Director .



KEA
GREEN HILL EDUCATION CENTRE  


Background


KEA
Green Hill Educational Centre (KEA GHEC) was established in 2004 at
the hill with the mango trees, to carry out a pilot project on
education in Kasejjere village.


 Before
the establishment of the school, the nearest primary school was at a
distance of seven kilometers walk. KEA’s school reduced the distance for
children to walk, making
education more accessible.


 The
school is open for all children; including those who are orphans or
from vulnerable families and cannot afford the school fees. The
school now has 250 pupils,
of which sixty are from vulnerable families and forty are orphans.


KEA
GHEC’s mission is
to provide quality education to the pupils and teach the importance
and management of the environment and natural resources. 



The
school has its own gardens and nursery beds. Unfortunately the
school’s vegetable gardens have dried up due
to the water shortage,
but there are plans to create a water pond to harvest water for
irrigating vegetables.


The
pupils are educated on the environment through lectures, songs, and
several activities like cleaning up the school ground, planting
seedlings, taking care of the gardens to learn about food security,
and the anthill project, through which the effects of


Despite
its good work, the school has not received any funding and it
currently still lacks facilities such as an office, classrooms, desks
and blackboards. 



The
devoted teachers are paid little. 30,000 Ugandan
shillings
(Euro 12,13.6
USD, 17.49AUD)
a month, the school pays for their meals and provides hospitable
accommodation. 



KEA
Green Hill Educational Centre is a truly genuine and authentic
school, struggling to make it. The formation of an executive
committee contributed to the expansion of activities. 



The
Director John Kaganga has been there
since the beginning, and this has benefited the organisation a lot.
The Director is a hardworking man who makes a lot of personal
sacrifices for KEA. 

Many
people interviewed spoke out their gratitude for what the community
means
to them and has helped them.




Students in the nursery bed 






















KEA
Green Hill Education Centre School is a Private School encompassing
Primary education for boys and girls from entry level to Year 15.


We
are located in Kasejjere Village Kikandwa Sub county Mityana District
Uganda but draw an attendance from a broader area.


 KEA
GHEC School started and was launched in 2004 with four teachers and
only  volunteer students, the school has grown to almost 250
students. The student roll is predominantly from the lower
socio-economic areas of Kikandwa.


KEA
School is passionate about academic and character excellence. This is
recognized through the delivery of the Ugandan and International
curriculum, which is the basis of academic development to shape the
whole person. We are blessed with a fiercely dedicated staff. 



Their
professionalism and an “anything is possible” attitude create a
powerful environment for growth. Importantly, community partnership
between school, family and international volunteers of support that
ensures each child gets the best possible start in life.


Here,
we specialize in the character and academic development of children. 



Formal
education plays a fundamental role in identifying, developing and
maximizing the unique gifts and talents children inherently possess.


From
the earliest possible age, we partner with parents to develop a clear
pathway for our students throughout their entire schooling life, up
to employment. 



KEA
GHEC is a powerful community, the
school school along
with our vibrant local
community patterns teach
the ethos which is our
community. 



Collectively,
we create a culture of sound values and convictions so children know
they they have a special purpose in life.


We
believe in our students, and as a consequence they marinate in an
environment that is positively geared towards success. We don’t
just encourage success, we celebrate it.


Our
Director John Kaganga, 
After 20 years of teaching and living with community, is honored to
work alongside like-minded professionals who are passionate about our
approach, and about the future of the
children.


Education
is not just about teaching, it’s about investing
into the lives of tomorrow’s leaders.


Education
is a lifelong journey, and I’m tremendously privileged to be a part
of it for the next generation.



 A teacher takes nursery kids through a lesson

KEA
has now been running a child sponsorship program since 2004. 


We
believe in child sponsorship because it connects people like you with
children that are miles away, and gives you the opportunity to
develop a unique personal relationship with your sponsor child.

Each
sponsor child gets the opportunity to go to school, a new school
uniform, lunchtime meals where possible, exercise books and
stationary, and access to First Aid. You can sponsor a child in KEA
Green Hill Education Centre and give them a future today. 

Life
in Kasejjere Village is a struggle for anyone, but the life of a
child is even harder.

Imagine,
growing up in a world where you lack the very basics in life, food,
clean water, medicine, shelter, safety, a bed of your own.

Beyond
that, there are no toys, no dolls, and no soccer balls, no sweets and
treats, at best, a bed of reeds to sleep on. 


School
would be wonderful to attend, the path out of poverty, but there is
no money for school fees, so you stay home and wait for a miracle,
but for most there is none, life is simply survival, staying
alive.Death
is very common to you (20% of Ugandan children do not reach the age
of six). 


Life
is hard, and yet, most of the world is unaware of your difficulty or
that
of any of Ugandan’s child. 


They
are amongst the voiceless of the world, needing others to speak on
their behalf, and my attempt to be voice for the voiceless, KEA Green
Hill Education children. 






Growing
up in Kikandwa rural community

Growing
up anywhere brings its share of problems, but growing up in a place
like  Kikandwa rural community is a struggle that is beyond imagination.

Put
yourself into the shoes of Ugandan child; I should say feet, (many
children do not wear shoes, but might wear sandals, flip–flops as I
call them).

You are fortunate to be still alive at the age of
six, many of your friends have died of things such as malaria,
dysentery, malnutrition, and the like.

The
fact that both father and mother are alive is another miracle. Life
expectancy for men is 40 years in Uganda and 42 years for women
(rarely do you encounter gray haired men.)
Malaria
is still the number one killer in Uganda, but AIDS comes into second
place.
Wherever
one goes, one can see the evidence of the ravages of AIDS. Go into
any school and ask how many children have only one parent, or no
parent and you would be astounded.

Orphans of AIDS

In
a country like Uganda with a population of 36 million, there are as
many as 1.5 million AIDS orphans. Yes, there is malaria and other
illnesses.


This
is the other war, AIDS, the silent killer that sweeps through
offices, villages, banks, schools and government institutions.
In
fact many businesses refuse to give time off for more than one
funeral a month to their employees, since death comes so frequently
to families.



A
story of a
child in Kasejjere

So
here you are, a child in Kikandwa, living in a small house, made of
sun baked, mud bricks, covered by a corrugated tin roof (they are
called iron sheets here), that leaks whenever it rains. 


The
room is small, yes, the house is one room, and if you are really
lucky it will be two. No kitchen, you have a stove outside, a
charcoal one, charcoal costs about 7 dollars (£5) a bag and for some
that lasts all month. 


If
you have no money you find some wood and use a fire to cook over. The
bathroom, consists of an outhouse down the path, shared by many
families, there is a common one used by the men and by all to wash
in.

Most
Ugandans bathe using plastic wash–tubs twice a day. A house like
that rents for 10 to 20 dollars a month in an urban center like
Kikandwa, and it is in slum areas of town. 


The
income of your parents is only about 40 dollars combined. Father
works on farm for a well to do family from 7 in the morning to 7
evening. Mother goes off at 6:30 in the morning to work as a maid for
someone in rich family and on farms.You
are a girl of 12, and now you are home alone, well almost.

 Father
might sleep for a few hours, but then he is off into town seeing if
he can come up with some extra work and make a few more Shillings for
the family. 


Why
are you not in school? Oh, the answer to that one is easy, a girl
does not need school, she only needs to take care of the house, get a
husband when she is older, have babies, raise a family, cook, maybe
work as maid, or in a restaurant, but there is no reason to invest in
a woman or so the thinking goes. (Most of the lack of education for
girls has to do with economics, the firstborn boy is usually sent to
school if any money is available.)Your oldest brother left at
7 that morning, he had to take a roll of toilet paper to school,
since the day before he was scolded for not having any. He also had
to take a new broom to class to sweep the classroom and the school
grounds after school.School is expensive.

A
new law had been passed in 1997 making Ugandan school free through
primary grades, but then there are all those other fees, such as PTA,
Building Funds, extra this and that. Besides school is six miles away
and the mini bus called taxi costs 50 cents each way. 


There
are the hidden costs that no one talks about at school, but are so
common.

Class
size is often about 100 students to the room. 


Even
that is supposed to change but has not. Mother had to come up with
extra money so that your brother could pay the teacher to sit up at
the front of the class, where he could hear and learn better.

Money
had also to be paid to have homework checked and corrected, and if
you wanted extra help called tutoring for the Primary 7 exam, there
was something extra for that. 


That
is why only one of your brothers goes to school, while the others
hang around until maybe some of the uncles and aunts in the family
can contribute something for the education of them.

For
that is how it works in Uganda, no family can ever come up with the
money alone, it takes combined resources of the extended family to
send children to school in most cases.
Daily, it is your job,
to look after the little ones. Do laundry in two plastic tubs with
water that you had to carry in a 5–gallon can up a hill to the
house. Not only washing, but there is cooking.

You
do not have to worry about preparing meat, there is no money for
that, except a few times a month. The shop is just around the corner
from you. No, you can’t ask for a cut of meat, you get what is
there and the price is the same. You really do not care about that
chewy, tough meat anyway, plus it is covered with flies, yuck.Live
chickens can be bought in the market, but they are expensive, costing
between four and five dollars. It is only on special occasions that
one will buy them, it is your job to kill and pluck clean if your
brothers are not around.

The
main staple of Uganda is Matooke (green bananas, masked and steamed
under banana leaves) and Posho made from corn flour.

Every
evening you buy a plastic sack of milk, for immediate consumption,
since it would spoil if you bought it during the day. It is sold
along the roads by vendors with carts, and if you pick one from the
bottom of the pile, it is still reasonably cool, well warm. 


Bread,
can also be bought there from the same roadside hawkers who call out
what they have for sale, as it gets dark small oil lamps illuminate
their wares.In the mornings it is your job to head to the
market to buy stalks of bananas, some sweet potatoes if any money is
on hand. 


There
are also red kidney beans, but during the two rainy seasons of the
year they may be filled with maggots and you do not like getting your
meat and protein that way, but that is reality and what can one do.

 Rice
is available but you have to pick the rocks out of it since it is no
fun chewing on them. It is also very expensive. There are potatoes
which you like and sometimes use when you buy beef, but it always
comes down to how much money the family has.The future does
not look bright for you.

You
hear people talking about things getting better, but you have not
seen it. Malaria still comes to visit you on a regular basis, there
is dysentery, cholera that one has to look out for, and as you have
gotten older and developed as a young woman has, there is the hidden
problem in Africa. 

Your
uncle has been coming around saying things to you, and suggesting
that you come to visit him and learn how to be a woman. Yes, things
are not getting better for you.
It would be nice to learn how
to read and write, but it may never happen, in fact that are not many
in the family that do. 


There
are only two ways out of the slum in which you live. One is to get an
education and the other way is what your Aunt  is doing, selling
herself to White and Indian men who have money and just might take
you in as a live in girlfriend.
That
however is not the way you learned in your church, just up the path
from your slum called Eden Revival where they spoke of Holiness,
right living and faith in God to bring about a future with hope. You
have had a lot of hope, prayed a lot, but not seen the bright future,
but then God must be busy in other parts of the world.
You
like going into town with your mother to Kikandwa market where you
see clothes for sale, not that you get many, it has been some time
since you last gotten a new skirt, and the detergent had long ago
washed out all the brightness that had been there (Omo does get the
dirt out, but also the color). 

You
reach down to scratch your feet, and notice that a few more jiggers
have lodged themselves there and it would be time again to cut them
out, since there was no money to go the doctor, and mother did a good
enough job with a knife.Fun, for you was playing with other
children, going down to the place where the men drank out of common
pot the homebrew that some of the women prepared.
There
you could dance to drums with some the other girls. You liked it and
everyone would join in while the old men would talk about yesterday,
today and tomorrow, always looking for that miracle to help them out
of the slum.
A new lottery had come to Kikandwa and Uncle
Stephen had taken all of his salary of 30 dollars, (30,000 shillings)
and bet it and won nothing in return. Others laughed about it but you
felt sorry for him.There was something new you had heard
about. Kikandwa Environmental Association organization set up a
little office and temporary classes in Kasejjere community and was
signing up children to go to school without school fees. 

They
also provided school uniforms, books, t and some food to most
vulnerable children. The cost would be paid for a by a family far
away and it was called sponsorship. Maybe, just maybe this was true
and someone did care about children like you maybe there was more to
life; maybe there would be a chance, an open door to have hope.
Maybe, someone did care. 
The reality is that you and I can
make the difference in the lives of children in Kikandwa. You can go
there like I and many others have done and actually work amongst
them, or you can contribute your money to an agency that will do so
on your behalf.
There
is a catch however.
Often
only a small portion can reach the child who really needs the help,
so one has to ask questions, such as how much of your money goes to
actually supporting your child? How much of it is used in
administration, fundraising and so on, goes toward the child and its
development in Uganda. which is why this campaign is so important to us 




Meet
Namukuye Nooren


Noreen
is now around 5 years old. She lives in Uganda in a Village called
Kasejjere. Noreen doesn't stay with her parents as her father passed
away in a car accident and her mother was a prostitute in the village
and passed away recently.
One
day Noreen elderly sister heard that there was free education at a
local school and so she came along to see if she could apply. 200
other children turned up with their parents or guardians but there
were only 30 places. Noreen’s sister like many others was turned
down.
However
she was not going to give up, so she came back each day hoping that
she would be accepted. For two weeks she kept coming back to the
school and each day she would be sent home.
I
was at that school and watched as children stood for hours hoping
that they would receive something as basic as an education. I was
amazed at how many turned up looking for something which we take so
much for granted.
That
was when I decided that I should do something, and KEA was birthed. I
said that I would get sponsors for five children.
I
would go home and tell the people here that we need to do something.
The
next day five children turned up to the school hoping to be accepted
but expecting to get sent away.
This
time they didn't get sent home. Today they would start school.
That
was when I met John Kaganga. Noreen has now been attending school for
two years and she hopes that someday she will look after her
Grandmother and get a job where she doesn't have to be a prostitute.



KEA
now sponsors well over 15 children and supports each year. Here are
just some of those children: Through the support of many generous
people, and the hard work of numerous young people in schools,
churches and youth groups, KEA has raised over US$ 5000 in the past
ten years to help build temporary buildings, and support many
children in need. Any donations we received will be put to excellent use helping this wonderful dynamic hard working community .",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

be more active. Whenever that happens, students are engaged in their own
 learning. There’s no manipulation in getting students active, either, 
it just happens. The outcome is that students better remember what 
they’ve learned when they are engaged in the process, and not passive 
by-standers. They are also learning how to apply STEM to real world problems that they experience in their community on a daily basis specifically in the context of food deserts and food insecurity.</li>

be more active. Whenever that happens, students are engaged in their own
 learning. There’s no manipulation in getting students active, either, 
it just happens. The outcome is that students better remember what 
they’ve learned when they are engaged in the process, and not passive 
by-standers. They are also learning how to apply STEM to real world problems that they experience in their community on a daily basis specifically in the context of food deserts and food insecurity.



    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute to our project there are other ways you can help:  
Promote, promote promote! Tell your friends, tell your church, tell your civic organization, tell your fraternity or sorority, tell the news media, tell your favorite blogger, tell your local philantropist friends, tell any and everybody about what we are doing so that we can make this a reality. 
Lets Sit Down and Talk About it: Organize a dinner and let us come talk about it! If you can't contribute; get several of your friends and family together and let us come and explain what we are doing and why it is important!

<p><a href=""http://africafootacademy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Africa Foot Academy</a> (AFA) was founded in 2012 with an
objective to empower the youth in Cameroon and enhance their life skills through
soccer. Currently, the non-profit soccer academy provides training for 158 children and youth, many of whom are
homeless. AFA supports these underprivileged children and youth by seeking them
host families and funding their primary and secondary schooling. AFA improves their performance at school eg. through the help of volunteers providing after-school remedial teaching for those in need. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130143/files/20150104014537-AFA_juniors_5.png?1420364737"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>AFA offers the most
talented youth players a path to professional sport, including a post in
the academy´s FC-AFA soccer team, which currently plays in the Cameroonian
third league with great development potential.</p>
<p>All training is offered free of
costs, hence also the poorest families can take part in the training programs of
AFA. This is unique in the Cameroonian soccer scene. Additionally, AFA supports also girls’ soccer and even has a girls’ soccer team. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130142/files/20150104014519-AFA_girls_and_senior_boys.png?1420364719"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Currently,
AFA is about to invest in a bus, in order to provide a safe transport to its
young players to soccer tournaments taking place around Cameroon. Due to bad
condition of roads, bad driving habits and old vehicles, the road safety in
Cameroon is close to non-existent. A number of deathly road accidents occur
weekly. This is most unfortunate taking into account that alternative ways to travel are not available
in Cameroon. </p>
<p>A 30-seat bus
(second hand) will ensure the necessary stability and safety for our kids en
route. <b>Here we need your help! </b>Every small contribution will bring us closer to
this goal.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1379025/files/20150413081421-AFA_Umzug.PNG?1428938061"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">What We Need is a Bus - but WHY?</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The bus is
needed for tournaments mostly taking place around the West of Cameroon, the Littoral
Region with distances up to 600 km. Currently, AFA owns a minibus with 12 seats. This bus, however, is in a very bad condition and not sufficient for our teams travelling with
ca. 30 persons (including players and staff). Travelling by public/ private busses in
Cameroon is extremely expensive but also dangerous due to old vehicles and bad roads. Road accidents
occur regularly also to busses carrying 50 passangers or more.</p>
<p>A team bus
will provide the academy flexibility and - above all - ensure the safety of our
kids en route. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130286/files/20150104041204-Bus_fotos_mit_text.png?1420373524"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>With 49 000 USD we will be able to by a
stable, high quality second hand 30-seat bus in Germany and ship it over to Cameroon.
Unfortunately, as is the case in many African countries, also in Cameroon the
quality busses in good shape simply are not available for this price.
Additionally, the second hand busses in Cameroon do not have a guarantee unlike
the ones bought in Germany. Hence, shipping the vehicle from Germany to
Cameroon is more rentable. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>
</span></p>
<p><b>Every contribution, no matter how big or
small, will help us!</b> If we raise more than 49 000 USD, the rest of the
funds will be invested in the formal schooling of our young players (school
fees, text books, school uniforms), especially of those coming from the poorest
families or who are living on the streets.</p>
<p>Again, if we do not succeed to raise enough
funds this time, our purchase will only be postponed. We will continue our efforts
until we have reached the goal. We see the positive impact of soccer and team
sport on underprivileged children and youth every day. This makes us push
further.</p>
<p>For every donation, we will send you a HUGE
VIRTUAL HUG!! Once we have bought the bus, every donor will receive an e-mail from us with
news and photos of the bus in use.  </p>

(AFA) a été fondée en 2012 avec un objectif de responsabiliser les jeunes au
Cameroun et améliorer leurs compétences de vie à travers le football.
Actuellement, l’académie de football à but non lucratif offre une formation
pour 158 enfants et jeunes, dont beaucoup sont des sans-abri. AFA soutient ces
enfants et les jeunes défavorisés en les cherchant familles d'accueil et le
financement de leur scolarité primaire et secondaire. AFA améliore leur
performance à l'école. grâce à l'aide de bénévoles dispensant un enseignement
de rattrapage après l'école pour ceux qui sont dans le besoin.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130143/files/20150104014537-AFA_juniors_5.png?1420364737"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>AFA offre aux jeunes joueurs les plus talentueux un chemin au sport
professionnel, y compris un poste dans l'équipe de football du FC-AFA, qui joue
actuellement dans la troisième ligue camerounaise avec un grand potentiel de
développement.</p>
<p>Toute la formation est offert gratuitement, donc aussi les
familles les plus pauvres peuvent participer aux programmes de formation de
AFA. Ce qui est unique dans la scène du football camerounais. En outre, AFA
soutient également de soccer des filles, et possede même une équipe de football
feminine.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130142/files/20150104014519-AFA_girls_and_senior_boys.png?1420364719"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></div><div>
<p></p>
<p>Actuellement, AFA est sur le point d'investir dans un bus, afin de fournir
un transport sûr à ses jeunes joueurs de tournois de football qui se déroulent partout
au Cameroun. En raison du mauvais état des routes, mauvaises habitudes de
conduite et des vieux véhicules, la sécurité routière au Cameroun est proche,
voire inexistante. Plus de 60 % des morts au Cameroun proviennent des accidents
routières. Ce qui est très malheureux en tenant compte du fait que d'autres
moyens de voyager ne sont pas disponibles au Cameroun.</p>
<p>Un bus de 30 places (de seconde main) assurera la stabilité et la sécurité
nécessaire sur la route des nos enfants. <strong>Ici, nous avons besoin de votre aide!</strong>
Chaque petite contribution nous rapproche de cet objectif.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1379033/files/20150413081551-AFA_Umzug.PNG?1428938151"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>  </p>
<h3>Nous avons besoin d'un bus - mais pourquoi?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Le bus est nécessaire pour la participation aux tournois qui se déroulent dans
la region  de l'Ouest du Cameroun, de la
Région du Littoral avec des distances allant jusqu'à 600 km. Actuellement, AFA
possède un minibus de 12 places. Ce bus, cependant, est dans un très mauvais
état et ne suffit pas pour nos équipes voyageant avec ca. 30 personnes (y
compris les joueurs et le personnel). Voyager en bus public / privé au Cameroun
est extrêmement coûteux, mais aussi dangereux en raison de vieux véhicules et
de mauvaises routes. Meme les bus de 50 places sont à l’origine des accidents
mortels et regulièrement.  </p>
<p>Un bus de l'équipe offrira la souplesse de l'académie et - surtout - assurera
la sécurité de nos enfants sur la voix routière.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130286/files/20150104041204-Bus_fotos_mit_text.png?1420373524"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Ce que vous obtenez &amp; ce que nous faisons</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Avec 49 000 USD, nous serons en mesure d’acheter un bus stable de 30 places
de haute qualité de seconde main en Allemagne. Nous l'expédions plus tard au Cameroun.
Malheureusement, comme c’est le cas dans de nombreux pays africains, également
au Cameroun les bus de qualités en bon états ne sont pas disponibles pour ce
prix, tout simplement. En outre, les bus de seconde mains au Cameroun n’ont pas
une garantie fiable, contrairement à ceux achetés en Allemagne. Par conséquent,
l'expédition du véhicule de l'Allemagne au Cameroun est plus rentable. </p>
<p><b>Chaque contribution peu importe, grand ou petit, nous aide!</b> Si nous attenions
plus de 49 000 USD, le reste des fonds sera investi dans l'éducation formelle
de nos jeunes joueurs (les frais de scolarité, les manuels scolaires, les uniformes
scolaires), en particulière de ceux provenant des familles les plus pauvres ou
qui vivent dans la rue.</p>
<p>Au contraire, si nous ne parvenons pas à réunir suffisamment de fonds cette
fois, notre achat sera reportée. Nous poursuivrons nos efforts jusqu'à ce que
nous attenions nos objectif. Nous voyons l'impact positif du football et du
sport d'équipe sur les enfants et les jeunes défavorisés tous les jours. Cela
nous motive à aller plus loin avec nos efforts.</p>
<p>Pour chaque don, nous vous ferons parvenir un REMERCIEMENT VIRTUELLE énorme
!! Quand nous aurions acheté le bus, chaque donateur recevra un e-mail de notre
part avec des nouvelles et des photos du bus en cours d'utilisation.</p>

parvenir en retour de votre don.</p>

Ausbildungsprogrammen von AFA teilnehmen können. Dies ist in der Kamerunischen
Fußballszene einzigartig. Zusätzlich unterstützt AFA auch Mädchenfußball und
hat sogar eine Mädchenfußballmannschaft. </p>

<p>Derzeit ist
AFA dabei, in einem Bus zu investieren, um einen sicheren Transport für seine
jungen Spieler zu Fußballturnieren zu sichern. Wegen dem schlechten Zustand der
Straßen, schlechtem Fahrverhalten und alten Fahrzeugen ist die Straßenverkehrssicherheit
in Kamerun nahezu nicht vorhanden. Wöchentlich stoßen eine Reihe von tödlichen
Verkehrsunfällen auf. Dies ist sehr bedauerlich, da keine alternativen Reisemöglichkeiten
in Kamerun verfügbar sind.</p>
<p>Ein Reisebus
mit 30 sitzen (aus zweiter Hand) würde unterwegs für die nötige Stabilität und
Sicherheit für unsere Kinder sorgen und <b>genau
hier brauchen wir Ihre Hilfe!</b> Jeder noch so kleine Beitrag wird uns ein
Stück näher zu diesem Ziel bringen.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Was wir brauchen ist ein Bus - aber warum?</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Der Bus wird
für den Transport zu Turnieren die meist im Westen von Kamerun und an den
Küstenregion mit Entfernungen von bis zu 600 km stattfinden benötigt. Derzeit
besitzt AFA einen Kleinbus mit 12 Sitzplätzen. Dieser Bus ist aber in einem
sehr schlechten Zustand und nicht für unsere Teamreisen mit ca. 30 Personen ausreichend
(einschließlich Spieler und das Personal). Anreise mit den öffentlichen /
privaten Bussen in Kamerun ist nicht nur extrem teuer, sondern auch gefährlich
wegen der alten Fahrzeuge und schlechten Straßen. Verkehrsunfälle treten
regelmäßig auf, sogar bei Bussen mit 50 Passagiere oder mehr.</p>
<p>Ein Team-Bus
würde der Akademie Flexibilität bieten und vor allem die Sicherheit unserer jungen
Spieler unterwegs. </p>

<h3>Was Sie erhalten &amp; was wir tun </h3>
<div>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Mit 49 000
USD werden wir in der Lage sein einen stabilen, 
hochwertigen 30-Mann Bus aus zweiter Hand in Deutschland zu erwerben und
ihn nach Kamerun zu verschicken. Leider ist diese Art von Qualitäts-Bussen in
guter Form in Kamerun, wie auch in vielen anderen Afrikanischen Ländern, zu
diesem Preis nicht verfügbar. Darüber hinaus haben die gebrauchten Busse in
Kamerun keine Garantie im Gegensatz zu den in Deutschland gekauften. Daher ist der Versand des Fahrzeugs aus Deutschland nach Kamerun vorteilhafter.</p>
<p>Jeder Beitrag, egal wie groß oder klein, wird uns dabei helfen! Empfangen
wir mehr als 49 000 USD, wird der Rest in die formale Schulbildung unserer
jungen Spieler investiert (Schulgebühren,
Text Bücher, Schuluniformen), vor allem in die die aus den ärmsten Familien kommen
oder die die auf den Straßen leben.</p>
<p>Auch wenn es
uns nicht gelingt, genügend Geld zu sammeln wird das unseren Kauf nur
verschieben. Wir werden unsere Bemühungen fortsetzen, bis wir das Ziel erreicht
haben. Wir sehen die positiven Auswirkungen des Fußballs und Teamsports an benachteiligten
Kindern und Jugendlichen tagtäglich, was uns nur antreibt,</p>
<p>Für jede
Spende, werden wir Ihnen eine RIESIGE VIRTUELLE UMARMUNG als Dankeschön senden!!

Scroll down for French and
German versions. La version française et allemande est en dessous.
Für die Deutsche und Französische Version, sehen Sie
unten.
Africa Foot Academy (AFA) was founded in 2012 with an
objective to empower the youth in Cameroon and enhance their life skills through
soccer. Currently, the non-profit soccer academy provides training for 158 children and youth, many of whom are
homeless. AFA supports these underprivileged children and youth by seeking them
host families and funding their primary and secondary schooling. AFA improves their performance at school eg. through the help of volunteers providing after-school remedial teaching for those in need. 


AFA offers the most
talented youth players a path to professional sport, including a post in
the academy´s FC-AFA soccer team, which currently plays in the Cameroonian
third league with great development potential.
All training is offered free of
costs, hence also the poorest families can take part in the training programs of
AFA. This is unique in the Cameroonian soccer scene. Additionally, AFA supports also girls’ soccer and even has a girls’ soccer team. 


Currently,
AFA is about to invest in a bus, in order to provide a safe transport to its
young players to soccer tournaments taking place around Cameroon. Due to bad
condition of roads, bad driving habits and old vehicles, the road safety in
Cameroon is close to non-existent. A number of deathly road accidents occur
weekly. This is most unfortunate taking into account that alternative ways to travel are not available
in Cameroon. 
A 30-seat bus
(second hand) will ensure the necessary stability and safety for our kids en
route. Here we need your help! Every small contribution will bring us closer to
this goal.


 
What We Need is a Bus - but WHY?

The bus is
needed for tournaments mostly taking place around the West of Cameroon, the Littoral
Region with distances up to 600 km. Currently, AFA owns a minibus with 12 seats. This bus, however, is in a very bad condition and not sufficient for our teams travelling with
ca. 30 persons (including players and staff). Travelling by public/ private busses in
Cameroon is extremely expensive but also dangerous due to old vehicles and bad roads. Road accidents
occur regularly also to busses carrying 50 passangers or more.
A team bus
will provide the academy flexibility and - above all - ensure the safety of our
kids en route. 



What You Get & What We Do
 

With 49 000 USD we will be able to by a
stable, high quality second hand 30-seat bus in Germany and ship it over to Cameroon.
Unfortunately, as is the case in many African countries, also in Cameroon the
quality busses in good shape simply are not available for this price.
Additionally, the second hand busses in Cameroon do not have a guarantee unlike
the ones bought in Germany. Hence, shipping the vehicle from Germany to
Cameroon is more rentable. 


Every contribution, no matter how big or
small, will help us! If we raise more than 49 000 USD, the rest of the
funds will be invested in the formal schooling of our young players (school
fees, text books, school uniforms), especially of those coming from the poorest
families or who are living on the streets.
Again, if we do not succeed to raise enough
funds this time, our purchase will only be postponed. We will continue our efforts
until we have reached the goal. We see the positive impact of soccer and team
sport on underprivileged children and youth every day. This makes us push
further.
For every donation, we will send you a HUGE
VIRTUAL HUG!! Once we have bought the bus, every donor will receive an e-mail from us with
news and photos of the bus in use.  
Below you will find a list of perks that we
will send you in return for your donation.

 Notre projet en bref
Für die Deutsche Version, sehen Sie unten.
Africa Foot Academy
(AFA) a été fondée en 2012 avec un objectif de responsabiliser les jeunes au
Cameroun et améliorer leurs compétences de vie à travers le football.
Actuellement, l’académie de football à but non lucratif offre une formation
pour 158 enfants et jeunes, dont beaucoup sont des sans-abri. AFA soutient ces
enfants et les jeunes défavorisés en les cherchant familles d'accueil et le
financement de leur scolarité primaire et secondaire. AFA améliore leur
performance à l'école. grâce à l'aide de bénévoles dispensant un enseignement
de rattrapage après l'école pour ceux qui sont dans le besoin.


AFA offre aux jeunes joueurs les plus talentueux un chemin au sport
professionnel, y compris un poste dans l'équipe de football du FC-AFA, qui joue
actuellement dans la troisième ligue camerounaise avec un grand potentiel de
développement.
Toute la formation est offert gratuitement, donc aussi les
familles les plus pauvres peuvent participer aux programmes de formation de
AFA. Ce qui est unique dans la scène du football camerounais. En outre, AFA
soutient également de soccer des filles, et possede même une équipe de football
feminine.



Actuellement, AFA est sur le point d'investir dans un bus, afin de fournir
un transport sûr à ses jeunes joueurs de tournois de football qui se déroulent partout
au Cameroun. En raison du mauvais état des routes, mauvaises habitudes de
conduite et des vieux véhicules, la sécurité routière au Cameroun est proche,
voire inexistante. Plus de 60 % des morts au Cameroun proviennent des accidents
routières. Ce qui est très malheureux en tenant compte du fait que d'autres
moyens de voyager ne sont pas disponibles au Cameroun.
Un bus de 30 places (de seconde main) assurera la stabilité et la sécurité
nécessaire sur la route des nos enfants. Ici, nous avons besoin de votre aide!
Chaque petite contribution nous rapproche de cet objectif.
 
  
Nous avons besoin d'un bus - mais pourquoi?

Le bus est nécessaire pour la participation aux tournois qui se déroulent dans
la region  de l'Ouest du Cameroun, de la
Région du Littoral avec des distances allant jusqu'à 600 km. Actuellement, AFA
possède un minibus de 12 places. Ce bus, cependant, est dans un très mauvais
état et ne suffit pas pour nos équipes voyageant avec ca. 30 personnes (y
compris les joueurs et le personnel). Voyager en bus public / privé au Cameroun
est extrêmement coûteux, mais aussi dangereux en raison de vieux véhicules et
de mauvaises routes. Meme les bus de 50 places sont à l’origine des accidents
mortels et regulièrement.  
Un bus de l'équipe offrira la souplesse de l'académie et - surtout - assurera
la sécurité de nos enfants sur la voix routière.


Ce que vous obtenez & ce que nous faisons

Avec 49 000 USD, nous serons en mesure d’acheter un bus stable de 30 places
de haute qualité de seconde main en Allemagne. Nous l'expédions plus tard au Cameroun.
Malheureusement, comme c’est le cas dans de nombreux pays africains, également
au Cameroun les bus de qualités en bon états ne sont pas disponibles pour ce
prix, tout simplement. En outre, les bus de seconde mains au Cameroun n’ont pas
une garantie fiable, contrairement à ceux achetés en Allemagne. Par conséquent,
l'expédition du véhicule de l'Allemagne au Cameroun est plus rentable. 
Chaque contribution peu importe, grand ou petit, nous aide! Si nous attenions
plus de 49 000 USD, le reste des fonds sera investi dans l'éducation formelle
de nos jeunes joueurs (les frais de scolarité, les manuels scolaires, les uniformes
scolaires), en particulière de ceux provenant des familles les plus pauvres ou
qui vivent dans la rue.
Au contraire, si nous ne parvenons pas à réunir suffisamment de fonds cette
fois, notre achat sera reportée. Nous poursuivrons nos efforts jusqu'à ce que
nous attenions nos objectif. Nous voyons l'impact positif du football et du
sport d'équipe sur les enfants et les jeunes défavorisés tous les jours. Cela
nous motive à aller plus loin avec nos efforts.
Pour chaque don, nous vous ferons parvenir un REMERCIEMENT VIRTUELLE énorme
!! Quand nous aurions acheté le bus, chaque donateur recevra un e-mail de notre
part avec des nouvelles et des photos du bus en cours d'utilisation.
Ci-dessous vous trouverez une liste des avantages que nous vous ferons

 Unser Projekt in Kürze

Africa Foot Academy (AFA) wurde im Jahr 2012 mit dem Ziel, die Jugend in Kamerun zu stärken
und zur Verbesserung ihrer Lebenskompetenzen durch Fußball gegründet. Derzeit
bietet die gemeinnützige Fußball-Akademie Schulungen für 158 Kinder und Jugendliche,
von denen viele obdachlos sind. AFA unterstützt diese benachteiligten Kinder
und Jugendlichen von der Suche einer Gastfamilie, bis zur Finanzierung ihrer
Grund- und Realschulbildung. Durch AFA werden ihre Leistungen in der Schule verbessert
zum Beispiel durch die Hilfe von Freiwilligen, die sich dazu bereitstellen außerschulischen
Förderunterricht anzubieten.


AFA bietet
den talentiertesten Nachwuchsspielern einen Pfad zu dem Profisport, darunter
einen Platz in der offiziellen Akademie Fußballmannschaft FC-AFA, die derzeit
in der Kamerunischen dritten Liga spielt, mit großem Entwicklungspotenzial.
Alle
Schulungen werden kostenfrei angeboten, damit auch die ärmsten Familien an den
Ausbildungsprogrammen von AFA teilnehmen können. Dies ist in der Kamerunischen
Fußballszene einzigartig. Zusätzlich unterstützt AFA auch Mädchenfußball und
hat sogar eine Mädchenfußballmannschaft. 


Derzeit ist
AFA dabei, in einem Bus zu investieren, um einen sicheren Transport für seine
jungen Spieler zu Fußballturnieren zu sichern. Wegen dem schlechten Zustand der
Straßen, schlechtem Fahrverhalten und alten Fahrzeugen ist die Straßenverkehrssicherheit
in Kamerun nahezu nicht vorhanden. Wöchentlich stoßen eine Reihe von tödlichen
Verkehrsunfällen auf. Dies ist sehr bedauerlich, da keine alternativen Reisemöglichkeiten

deutschem Know-how geröstet und verpackt. Die gesamte Produktionskette von der
Ernte bis zur Röstung und Verpackung wird in Kamerun gehalten, um die Branche näher
an die Landwirte zu bringen. ECF Kaffee wird im Herbst 2015 verfügbar sein.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Power of One - Donate Just $1, change the life of a child! (But You Can Give as Much as You Want)<br/></p>
<p>Our Mission:<br/></p>
<p>It is the mission of VICM to bring children and families together in an interactive educational space where dynamic play inspires a love of learning.<br/></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Our story:</p>
<p>Originally we thought it would be better if we launched our campaign with a rainbow instead of a storm cloud. But as everyone can see, we have not even come close to reaching our goal. It makes our Nelson Mandela quote especially poignant.<br/></p>
<p>We began this museum as a labor of love. We looked at how few fun, educational opportunities there were for VI children and their families and caregivers. We looked at the staggering statistics out there on the state of education in the Territory, and we decided we would build a place for the community to come together and cherish our most precious resource, our children.  <br/></p>
<p>According to the VI Dept. of Education, 34% of VI children entering public kindergarten lack age-appropriate cognition skills and 50% lack age-appropriate word and comprehension skills. Proficiency rates in math, reading and science hover around 50% in grades 3-11 in public schools. Yes, 50%!<br/></p>
<p>Children who do not participate in early childhood education are 70% more likely to commit a violent crime and be imprisoned, 25% more likely to drop out of school, and 40% more likely to become a teen parent.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So the data is there. It is obvious we need to do more.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>And you can! For Just $1, you, too, can change the life of a child. </b><br/></span>
</p>
</div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have reached out to the community in this crowd funding campaign because we wanted this museum to be for every Virgin Islander, built by Virgin Islanders! Look at it like this, for Just $1 donation today, you will have a beautiful and wondrous museum to enjoy, for years and years to come. The Boston Children's Museum is over 100 years old and the Brooklyn Children's Museum is almost 120 years old. <br/><br/></span>On March 1, 2016, the first ever museum of it’s kind in the Territory, The Virgin Islands Children's Museum, will open its doors. But only if you donate now.<br/><br/>The power of one- Just $1, (But You Can Give as Much as You Want)<br/>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>For the past two years we have dedicated every extra moment to building this museum.  We have found that along the way some folks did not know what a children's museum is, some folks didn't think it is a viable project, and some folks did not believe that the education of our children is at risk. <br/><br/>But it is! Every year schools get their budgets cut, parents have to work more hours and often more than one job, and children have to bear the brunt of a society that is moving so fast it cannot slow down enough to give them a childhood based on age-appropriate activities. Children need to play. When they play, they learn. It is as simple as that.<br/><br/>Now that we are heading into our final two weeks of this crowd funding campaign and looking at how badly it is doing, we are saddened that the museum has not been championed by the community in the way we thought it would be. We have even been attacked on social media and called elitists when we published some of the amounts we are trying to raise. <br/><br/>And that right there is part of the problem. It takes a lot of money to build a museum.  In fact, the VICM has one of the smallest build-out budgets of any museum scheduled to open to in the US next year. A new children's museum recently opened in Mississippi, and their build-out cost was $28,000,000! The VI Children's Museum build-out cost IS ONLY $108,000- and we are only trying to raise $55,000 from direct public contribution. Admission will only be $8, and while we had been instructed to make it more by our financial advisors, we chose not to to ensure accessibility to as many families as possible. <br/><br/>It takes a lot of people with a lot of vision and passion to build a museum. We have given everything we are to this museum, have never gotten paid for any of this, work between 30 and 40 hours a week on top of our regular full time jobs, and have sacrificed so much in our lives to come this far and then be called names and watch our funding drive perform so dismally.<br/><br/>But we won't fail! Our children need this, our community needs this. Spending by visitors to children's museums generates $80.8 billion dollars of valuable revenue annually for their local communities! Everyone wins with this museum!<br/><br/><h3>Other Things You Can Do</h3>We understand times are hard economically. Trust us, we barely make rent ourselves! So, maybe you just can't give right now. Maybe you can only give a little and you want to do more.  Well, you can- there is so much more you can do to help!<br/><br/>Share this campaign on Facebook and email it to all of your friends.

Short Summary
The Power of One - Donate Just $1, change the life of a child! (But You Can Give as Much as You Want)
Our Mission:
It is the mission of VICM to bring children and families together in an interactive educational space where dynamic play inspires a love of learning.

Our story:
Originally we thought it would be better if we launched our campaign with a rainbow instead of a storm cloud. But as everyone can see, we have not even come close to reaching our goal. It makes our Nelson Mandela quote especially poignant.
We began this museum as a labor of love. We looked at how few fun, educational opportunities there were for VI children and their families and caregivers. We looked at the staggering statistics out there on the state of education in the Territory, and we decided we would build a place for the community to come together and cherish our most precious resource, our children.  
According to the VI Dept. of Education, 34% of VI children entering public kindergarten lack age-appropriate cognition skills and 50% lack age-appropriate word and comprehension skills. Proficiency rates in math, reading and science hover around 50% in grades 3-11 in public schools. Yes, 50%!
Children who do not participate in early childhood education are 70% more likely to commit a violent crime and be imprisoned, 25% more likely to drop out of school, and 40% more likely to become a teen parent.

So the data is there. It is obvious we need to do more.
And you can! For Just $1, you, too, can change the life of a child. 


We have reached out to the community in this crowd funding campaign because we wanted this museum to be for every Virgin Islander, built by Virgin Islanders! Look at it like this, for Just $1 donation today, you will have a beautiful and wondrous museum to enjoy, for years and years to come. The Boston Children's Museum is over 100 years old and the Brooklyn Children's Museum is almost 120 years old. On March 1, 2016, the first ever museum of it’s kind in the Territory, The Virgin Islands Children's Museum, will open its doors. But only if you donate now.The power of one- Just $1, (But You Can Give as Much as You Want)
 

What We Need & What You GetHelp us build this museum! Our budget for the construction of the exhibits and the museum is $108,000. 
We have an enticing array of thank you perks.  Show your museum support in an awesome T-Shirt, or beautify your car's bumper with a cool sticker. Want to have your child's artwork be postcards in the museum gift shop? Or have your child be our Ultimate Mad Scientist Science Guide- in all of our exhibit explanation videos in the museum? Make your contribution today.So many choices- so many ways to make a difference in a child's life. And it starts with Just $1!

In this time I saw too many students with too much potential missing out on the education that they deserve. I saw too many of my colleagues stressed, overworked and stretched by onerous accountability measures and a strict corporate like approach to school management. EEVA is attempting to find ways in which to expand the pockets of educational innovation and directly address these challenges so that they may become broad, holistic changes across whole-school systems. Our services support teachers in implementing New Pedagogies for Deeper Learning within theirclassrooms - a framework for education that involves strong learning partnerships between teachers, students, local business, community groups and families. EEVA is a response to the crisis of boredom and frustration among students and career disillusionment among teachers.

<p>Massage therapy is believed to be  one of the most-suited

He lost his vision due to a dangerous pituitary tumor which has inserted into optic nerves leading to atrophy papillary. In 2000, the family took him to treatment while he was in high school. By 2003, his eyes became totally blind. After two surgeries, he not only became totally blind but also suffered serious hearing loss so he could only stay at home. The first week we met, Thang said ""I have no hope for future. When my mother passes away, I only can sponge on my sister"". And now after completing our intensive massage therapy training programs, Thang has become a masseur since November 2014 and below is his client's comment on TripAdvisor:</span></p>

<b>Lan - a visually impaired single-mom and masseuse</b>
</div><div>
<b></b><p>""I was born with an innate eyesight weakness. When I was 6-months old, my family took me to get eye surgery so that my left eyesight could be improved. However, the operation was unsuccessful and my left eye experienced a total loss of vision. When I grew up, I went to school like many other children but due to my extremely weak vision, I could not catch up with my fellow classmates. Thanks to a relative, I had an opportunity to learn traditional Vietnamese massage organized by a state-funded blind center in 1998. However, massage service was not popular at that time while the blind massage workers tended to be looked down on. Therefore, I had taken several jobs such as cleaning and selling clothes for many years. I lost my job when having a baby so I stayed at home for two years until I heard about Blind-Link and its activities to support the blind community. Participation in its training courses and having a good job like the one offered by Omamori Spa is fairly competitive; therefore, it requires us to make more efforts to become highly skilled therapists. Moreover, Blind-Link has also supported me in bringing up my daughter. Thanks to the project, I feel that my life has become more meaningful. In the future, I want to continue working for this useful long-term project. I also hope to support other blind and visually-impaired people so that they can get the job they love, and manage to live a life as fulfilling as mine.""</p>

</div><div>
<p><span>When my brother and I were born, we were able to see. At two years old, we were infected with measles which made us lose all of sight. Since then I have been living in the dark. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">During my childhood, I only spent most of time at home and roaming around the village. I neither had many friends nor attended school. I felt self-pity when seeing children at my age go to class. I wanted to be like them. When I was seventeen years old, the blind association in my province offered me an opportunity to learn Braille. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Three years later, I asked my parents to borrow money for me so that I could attend a vocational training course in the downtown of the province. Initially I worked in a relative’s massage parlor to learn traditional massage techniques from colleagues for almost a year. Then I moved to Hanoi to participate in a three-month massage training course in the Training and Rehabilitation Center for the Vietnamese blind. After graduation, I decided to stay in Hanoi and worked at a bunch of blind massage parlors. My job was quite arduous and risky. Official working hours are from 9AM to midnight; however, sometimes, I finished my work at 1AM or 2AM the next day. Most of my customers are blue-collar workers. Drunken clients sometimes were rude when threatening and violently beating me.. A customer once even suspected me of having stolen his 10 million VND (or $500) as he could not remember where he had put his money. Although I had been declared not guilty by the police, I still felt severely hurt by this incident.</span></p>

The working environment in Omamori Spa as well as its massage techniques are totally new and challenging to me. I had to learn new massage modalities and practiced extensively for three months to receive an employment offer from the Omamori Spa in July, 2014 . Although I am earning less income than before, I am having access to tons of learning opportunities. Thanks to Blind-Link, the first time in my life, I have been taught English and am acquiring new knowledge of many types of massage techniques. The compliments and good feed-backs I have received from the customers make me feel valued and respected, which are truly meaningful to me. <br/></span></p>

<p><i>95%
người khiếm thị Việt Nam đang sống trong nghèo khó và túng quẫn vì thất nghiệp.
Chúng tôi cùng nhau tạo dựng Blind-Link để thay đổi thực trạng đáng buồn này,
và chúng tôi cần các bạn chung tay hỗ trợ.</i></p>
<p>Xoa bóp trị liệu được đánh giá là một
trong những công việc phù hợp nhất với người khiếm thị khu vực Đông Á, trong đó
có người khiếm thị Việt Nam. Tuy nhiên,  vì không được đào tạo chuyên nghiệp,
hầu hết người khiếm thị Việt Nam hiện đang kiếm sống bằng công việc này phải
làm việc trong những điều kiện hết sức khó khăn với thu nhập thấp, đối mặt với
xâm hại tình dục và bạo lực từ khách hàng. Để góp phần thay đổi thực trạng này,
chúng tôi đã thành lập Blind-Link. Trong hơn một năm hoạt động, đã có gần 300 lượt người khiếm thị thụ hưởng các chương trình của Blind-Link, và đã tạo công việc toàn thời
gian cho 16 người khiếm thị tại mô hình thí điểm của chúng tôi là Omamori Spa (số 102 B1 ngõ 5 Huỳnh Thúc Kháng, Hà Nội). Omamori Spa, với lượng khách nước ngoài chiếm 60%, đã được TripAdvisor trao tặng Chứng nhận Dịch vụ Xuất sắc 2015.</p>
<p>Nhưng tất cả những điều này vẫn CHƯA ĐỦ!
Việt Nam chúng ta có đến hơn 3,9 triệu người khiếm thị. Chúng tôi rất cần sự
giúp đỡ của các bạn để hỗ trợ họ thông qua việc mở rộng các chương trình đào tạo.
Chúng ta sẽ cùng nhau tạo dựng niềm tin, phát triển năng lực cho người khiếm thị,
và giúp họ thay đổi tương lai của chính mình. </p>
<p><b>MỤC TIÊU 35.000USD!</b></p>
<p>Chúng tôi cần huy động được 35.000USD
để tổ chức 05 (năm) khóa đào tạo massage trị liệu trong khoảng thời gian từ
tháng 8/2015 đến tháng 11/2016, mỗi khóa kéo dài hai tháng, cho 100 thanh niên
khiếm thị tuổi từ 18 đến 35 xuất thân từ các vùng nông thôn và miền núi ở Việt
Nam.</p>
<p>Mỗi chương trình đào tạo hai tháng này
sẽ cung cấp cho các học viên 400 giờ học bao gồm:</p>
<p>+ 300 giờ dạy massage Thụy Điển
hoặc bấm huyệt, đạo đức nghề nghiệp, và kiến thức tự bảo vệ, chăm sóc bản thân;</p>
<p>+ 60 giờ dạy Tiếng Anh giao tiếp để dễ
dàng tiếp xúc với khách hàng nước ngoài;</p>
<p>+ 20 giờ dạy Kỹ năng sống; </p>
<p>+ 20 giờ dạy Quản lý tài chính.</p>

<p><b>Thắng – kỹ thuật viên khiếm thị
và khiếm thính </b></p>
<p>Cha mất từ
năm 2009 vì ung thư vòm họng, hiện giờ Thắng đang sống với mẹ.Thắng không còn
nhìn thấy gì kể từ sau khi một khối u tuyến yên chèn vào dây thần kinh mắt. Năm
2000, gia đình bắt đầu đưa Thắng đi điều trị khi em đang học cấp ba. Đến năm
2003,Thắng đã bị mù hoàn toàn. Sau hai cuộc phẫu thuật, không những Thắng không
còn có thể nhìn thấy gì, mà mà khả năng nghe cũng suy giảm nghiêm trọng (tỷ lệ
nghe ở hai tai là 80:20). Những ngày đầu mới gặp Thắng, em nói với chúng tôi:
“Em không hy vọng gì ở tương lai cả. Sau này khi mẹ em mất đi, rồi em cũng sẽ
chỉ ăn bám vào em gái của em mà thôi.”</p>

toàn thân trong 75 phút. Spa khá dễ tìm và có chỗ đỗ xe rộng rãi.</i></p>
<p><i>Khi
vào đến spa, bạn sẽ được chào đón bởi mùi hương rất dễ chịu và sự thân thiện của
bạn lễ tân. Bạn ấy nói tiếng Anh tốt và rất dễ thương, chu đáo. Anh nhân viên
trị liệu cho tôi là một người khiếm thị hoàn toàn, và chỉ có thể nghe bằng một
tai, nhưng anh ấy là một kỹ thuật vieen rất giỏi mà tôi từng được gặp.
Anh ấy đã làm việc rất xuất sắc.</i></p>
<p><i>Nhờ
chương trình khuyến mãi mùa đông mà chúng tôi chỉ phải trả 160.000 đồng (khoảng
$8) cho 75 phút xoa bóp trị liệu toàn thân. Và ở đây không nhận tiền tip. Tôi rất
hài lòng với dịch vụ ở đây, và chắc chắn sẽ giới thiệu với tất cả bạn bè, người
thân của mình.”</i></p>
<p><b>Lan –một người mẹ đơn
thân khiếm thị  </b></p>
<p>“Bẩm sinh mắt em đã
kém. Khi mới chỉ 6 tháng tuổi, gia đình đã cho em làm phẫu thuật mắt để cải
thiện mắt trái.Tuy nhiên, cuộc phẫu thuật đã không thành công, và mắt trái của
em bị mù hoàn toàn. Khi lớn lên, em cũng đến trường như các bạn, nhưng vì mắt
quá yếu nên em học không theo kịp bạn bè. Nhờ một người họ hàng giúp đỡ, em đã
được học tẩm quất truyền thống Việt Nam ở một trung tâm dành cho người khiếm
thị của Nhà nước. Tuy nhiên, dịch vụ xoa bóp tẩm quất vào hồi đó còn chưa phổ
biến, và chúng em thường bị kỳ thị. Vì vậy, em đã thử nhiều công việc khác như
lau dọn và bán áo quần trong nhiều năm. Khi em có con, em bị mất việc nên em
phải ở nhà, cho đến lúc em nghe đến những hoạt động hỗ trợ cộng đồng của Blind-Link.
Được tham gia vào những khóa học này, được có một công việc tốt như thế này ở
Omamori cũng không phải dễ dàng vì sự cạnh tranh khá cao. Vì vậy, chúng em phải
nỗ lực để trở nên thật giỏi và lành nghề. Ngoài ra, Blind-Link còn giúp em nuôi
dạy con gái em nữa. Nhờ dự án này mà em cảm thấy cuộc sống của mình trở nên ý
nghĩa hơn.Trong tương lai, em muốn được làm việc lâu dài với dự án. Em cũng
mong mình có thể giúp hỗ trợ những người khiếm thị khác để họ có thể có được
công việc yêu thích, và có thể có cuộc sống tốt như em hiện giờ.”</p>

tôi sẽ không đi tìm nơi nào khác nữa. Cơ sở này quá tuyệt, nhân viên vô cùng
chuyên nghiệp và cực kỳ tử tế. Điều tuyệt nhất chính là spa này là một tổ chức

<p><b>Hòa – Nhân viên trị
liệu khiếm thị đến từ Cao Bằng </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Em sinh ra trong một gia đình đông con, trong đó có hai người bị mù lòa. Khi
mới chào đời, chúng em cũng có thể nhìn thấy như những bạn khác. Khi lên hai, em
bị sởi dẫn đến biến chứng mù hoàn toàn. Từ đó, cả hai anh em chúng em phải sống
trong bóng tối. Lúc nhỏ, em chỉ ở nhà, và quanh quẩn trong làng. Em không có
nhiều bạn, cũng không được đi học. Em tủi thân khi thấy bạn bè cùng trang lứa
được đến trường. Em muốn được như các bạn. Khi được 17 tuổi, hội người mù trong
tỉnh cho em một cơ hội được học chữ nổi (Braille).</p>
<p>Ba năm sau, em hỏi mượn tiền bố mẹ để tham gia vào
khóa đào tạo nghề ở thị xã. Đầu tiên, em làm việc ở một cửa hàng tẩm quất của
người bà con trong gần một năm để học các kỹ thuật tẩm quất truyền thống từ các
bạn đồng nghiệp. Sau đó, em chuyển về Hà Nội để tham gia một khóa đào tạo ba
tháng ở Trung tâm Đào tạo và Phục hồi Chức năng cho người mù Việt Nam. Sau khi
học xong, em quyết định ở lại Hà Nội và đã làm qua nhiều quán tẩm quất. Công việc
của em khá vất vả và rủi ro. Giờ làm việc là từ 9 giờ sáng đến nửa đêm, nhưng
nhiều khi em phải làm đến 1 giờ-2 hai giờ sáng. Khách hàng của em chủ yếu là người
dân lao động. Một số người say rượu rất thô lỗ, họ dọa nạt và còn đánh em. Một
người khách có lần còn nghi ngờ em ăn trộm 10 triệu vì ông không thể nhớ đã để
tiền ở đâu. Dù công an đã tuyên bố là em không lấy, em cảm thấy bị tổn thương rất
nhiều vì chuyện này.</p>

<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Khi em tìm nơi làm việc mới, bạn
em giới thiệu em đến Omamori Spa và Blind-Link. Môi trường làm việc cũng như
các kỹ thuật massage ở Omamori hoàn toàn mới và khá khó với em. Em học các kiểu
massage khác nhau và nỗ lực tập luyện rất nhiều trong ba tháng để được nhận vào
làm ở Omamori từ tháng 7/2014. Dù mức lương hiện tại của em không cao bằng trước
đây, em có rất nhiều cơ hội học tập kiến thức khác nhau. Lần đầu tiên
trong đời, em được học tiếng Anh và học nhiều kỹ thuật massage chuyên nghiệp. Những
lời khen và nhận xét tích cực từ khách hàng khiến em cảm thấy mình được tôn trọng.
Điều đó thực sự rất ý nghĩa với em.</a></p>

</div></div>","95 % of Vietnamese legally blind people are living in poverty and desperation because of unemployment. We are here to change that, but we need  YOU.
Massage therapy is believed to be  one of the most-suited
jobs for the East Asian blind, including those living in Vietnam. However, due to the lack of professional trainings,
most of Vietnamese blind people are working in low-end massage parlors, receiving an average
of $1.7 per massage for 15-17 hours of working days while sometimes suffering
sexual and physical abuses by clients.
Recognizing
the blind people’s natural affinity for doing massage very well and the high
growth rate of the spa & wellness industry all over the world, which grew
58% from 2007-2013, reaching a
value of US$ 94 billion, we started a not-for-profit social
enterprise named Blind-Link in 2013.
Blind-Link provides  massage therapy, English communication, entrepreneurship education and
living skills trainings for Vietnamese young blind adults so that they are
qualified to work as massage practitioners in high-end spas and hotels for higher income and safe
workplace. 
Over one year of operation, there were nearly 300 blind people benefited from our programs and we have created
full-time employments for 16 young blind adults at our first Omamori Spa located in Hanoi.
Omamori Spa, whose 60% of clients are foreigners, won TripAdvisor 2015 Certificate of Excellence.
But THIS IS NOT ENOUGH! More than 3.9 million people are blind or visually impaired in Vietnam and we need your help to support them, expand our training programs, change their lives and pave the way for a brighter future. 
The Global Volunteers, United States has generously supported our 
campaign by starting a Sponsorship Program for Blind-Link trainees. If you are an American citizen, your contributions to our campaign 
through Global Volunteers are fully tax-deductible and will be tracked and recorded according to U.S. 
requirements. For detailed information about how to donate, please contact Ms. Linda Schlapp  lschlapp@globalvolunteers.org 
   $35,000 GOAL! 
We
are now raising $35,000 to organize five two-month intensive massage therapy
training programs from August 2015 to November 2016 for 100 young blind adults who are 18 - 35
years old from the rural and high mountainous regions of Vietnam. 
Each two-month training program will provide trainees with 400 hours of training with professional instructors including:
300 hours of Swedish or Acupressure Massage, massage ethics and self-care 
60 hours conversational English training to communicate with foreign clients at work 
20 hours of Living
Skills 
20 hours of Financial Literacy

THE IMPACT
 Your contribution will fundamentally change the life of many blind youths and their families like Thang, Lan, Hoa as below:
Thang - a blind- partially deaf masseur
Thang, whose father died in 2009 due to a throat cancer, is currently living with his mother. He lost his vision due to a dangerous pituitary tumor which has inserted into optic nerves leading to atrophy papillary. In 2000, the family took him to treatment while he was in high school. By 2003, his eyes became totally blind. After two surgeries, he not only became totally blind but also suffered serious hearing loss so he could only stay at home. The first week we met, Thang said ""I have no hope for future. When my mother passes away, I only can sponge on my sister"". And now after completing our intensive massage therapy training programs, Thang has become a masseur since November 2014 and below is his client's comment on TripAdvisor:



Lan - a visually impaired single-mom and masseuse

""I was born with an innate eyesight weakness. When I was 6-months old, my family took me to get eye surgery so that my left eyesight could be improved. However, the operation was unsuccessful and my left eye experienced a total loss of vision. When I grew up, I went to school like many other children but due to my extremely weak vision, I could not catch up with my fellow classmates. Thanks to a relative, I had an opportunity to learn traditional Vietnamese massage organized by a state-funded blind center in 1998. However, massage service was not popular at that time while the blind massage workers tended to be looked down on. Therefore, I had taken several jobs such as cleaning and selling clothes for many years. I lost my job when having a baby so I stayed at home for two years until I heard about Blind-Link and its activities to support the blind community. Participation in its training courses and having a good job like the one offered by Omamori Spa is fairly competitive; therefore, it requires us to make more efforts to become highly skilled therapists. Moreover, Blind-Link has also supported me in bringing up my daughter. Thanks to the project, I feel that my life has become more meaningful. In the future, I want to continue working for this useful long-term project. I also hope to support other blind and visually-impaired people so that they can get the job they love, and manage to live a life as fulfilling as mine.""



And one of her clients commented on TripAdvisor: 



Hoa - a blind masseur coming from the North mountainous province 

When my brother and I were born, we were able to see. At two years old, we were infected with measles which made us lose all of sight. Since then I have been living in the dark. During my childhood, I only spent most of time at home and roaming around the village. I neither had many friends nor attended school. I felt self-pity when seeing children at my age go to class. I wanted to be like them. When I was seventeen years old, the blind association in my province offered me an opportunity to learn Braille. 
Three years later, I asked my parents to borrow money for me so that I could attend a vocational training course in the downtown of the province. Initially I worked in a relative’s massage parlor to learn traditional massage techniques from colleagues for almost a year. Then I moved to Hanoi to participate in a three-month massage training course in the Training and Rehabilitation Center for the Vietnamese blind. After graduation, I decided to stay in Hanoi and worked at a bunch of blind massage parlors. My job was quite arduous and risky. Official working hours are from 9AM to midnight; however, sometimes, I finished my work at 1AM or 2AM the next day. Most of my customers are blue-collar workers. Drunken clients sometimes were rude when threatening and violently beating me.. A customer once even suspected me of having stolen his 10 million VND (or $500) as he could not remember where he had put his money. Although I had been declared not guilty by the police, I still felt severely hurt by this incident.





While I was looking for a new working place, my friend introduced me to the Omamori Spa and Blind-Link. The working environment in Omamori Spa as well as its massage techniques are totally new and challenging to me. I had to learn new massage modalities and practiced extensively for three months to receive an employment offer from the Omamori Spa in July, 2014 . Although I am earning less income than before, I am having access to tons of learning opportunities. Thanks to Blind-Link, the first time in my life, I have been taught English and am acquiring new knowledge of many types of massage techniques. The compliments and good feed-backs I have received from the customers make me feel valued and respected, which are truly meaningful to me.

ĐÓNG GÓP CỦA BẠN QUAN TRỌNG NHƯ THẾ NÀO

Tấm lòng hảo tâm của bạn sẽ thay đổi
hoàn toàn cuộc sống của nhiều thanh niên khiếm thị và gia đình họ; giống như
câu chuyện của Thắng, Lan, Hòa dưới đây: 
Thắng – kỹ thuật viên khiếm thị
và khiếm thính 
Cha mất từ
năm 2009 vì ung thư vòm họng, hiện giờ Thắng đang sống với mẹ.Thắng không còn
nhìn thấy gì kể từ sau khi một khối u tuyến yên chèn vào dây thần kinh mắt. Năm
2000, gia đình bắt đầu đưa Thắng đi điều trị khi em đang học cấp ba. Đến năm
2003,Thắng đã bị mù hoàn toàn. Sau hai cuộc phẫu thuật, không những Thắng không
còn có thể nhìn thấy gì, mà mà khả năng nghe cũng suy giảm nghiêm trọng (tỷ lệ
nghe ở hai tai là 80:20). Những ngày đầu mới gặp Thắng, em nói với chúng tôi:
“Em không hy vọng gì ở tương lai cả. Sau này khi mẹ em mất đi, rồi em cũng sẽ
chỉ ăn bám vào em gái của em mà thôi.”

Giờ đây, sau
khi tốt nghiệp khóa đào tạo massage chuyên sâu của chúng tôi, từ tháng 11/2014,
Thắng đã là một kỹ thuật viên tại Omamori Spa. Chúng ta hãy nghe nhận xét trên
trang TripAdvisor từ một trong những khách hàng của Thắng: 
“Dịch
vụ trị liệu cực kỳ xuất sắc!
(Kevin S.)
Được
anh bạn người Nga giới thiệu, tôi đã đến cơ sở này để thử massage. Tôi đã massage
ở nhiều nơi tại Hà Nội, và rất thích gói trị liệu toàn thân. Omamori đã không
làm tôi thất vọng. Họ đang có chương trình khuyến mãi lớn mùa đông từ tháng 11,
nên có vẻ chúng tôi đã đến rất đúng lúc. Chúng tôi đặt hai chỗ cho gói trị liệu
toàn thân trong 75 phút. Spa khá dễ tìm và có chỗ đỗ xe rộng rãi.
Khi
vào đến spa, bạn sẽ được chào đón bởi mùi hương rất dễ chịu và sự thân thiện của
bạn lễ tân. Bạn ấy nói tiếng Anh tốt và rất dễ thương, chu đáo. Anh nhân viên
trị liệu cho tôi là một người khiếm thị hoàn toàn, và chỉ có thể nghe bằng một
tai, nhưng anh ấy là một kỹ thuật vieen rất giỏi mà tôi từng được gặp.
Anh ấy đã làm việc rất xuất sắc.
Nhờ
chương trình khuyến mãi mùa đông mà chúng tôi chỉ phải trả 160.000 đồng (khoảng
$8) cho 75 phút xoa bóp trị liệu toàn thân. Và ở đây không nhận tiền tip. Tôi rất
hài lòng với dịch vụ ở đây, và chắc chắn sẽ giới thiệu với tất cả bạn bè, người
thân của mình.”
Lan –một người mẹ đơn
thân khiếm thị  
“Bẩm sinh mắt em đã
kém. Khi mới chỉ 6 tháng tuổi, gia đình đã cho em làm phẫu thuật mắt để cải
thiện mắt trái.Tuy nhiên, cuộc phẫu thuật đã không thành công, và mắt trái của
em bị mù hoàn toàn. Khi lớn lên, em cũng đến trường như các bạn, nhưng vì mắt
quá yếu nên em học không theo kịp bạn bè. Nhờ một người họ hàng giúp đỡ, em đã
được học tẩm quất truyền thống Việt Nam ở một trung tâm dành cho người khiếm
thị của Nhà nước. Tuy nhiên, dịch vụ xoa bóp tẩm quất vào hồi đó còn chưa phổ
biến, và chúng em thường bị kỳ thị. Vì vậy, em đã thử nhiều công việc khác như
lau dọn và bán áo quần trong nhiều năm. Khi em có con, em bị mất việc nên em
phải ở nhà, cho đến lúc em nghe đến những hoạt động hỗ trợ cộng đồng của Blind-Link.
Được tham gia vào những khóa học này, được có một công việc tốt như thế này ở
Omamori cũng không phải dễ dàng vì sự cạnh tranh khá cao. Vì vậy, chúng em phải
nỗ lực để trở nên thật giỏi và lành nghề. Ngoài ra, Blind-Link còn giúp em nuôi
dạy con gái em nữa. Nhờ dự án này mà em cảm thấy cuộc sống của mình trở nên ý
nghĩa hơn.Trong tương lai, em muốn được làm việc lâu dài với dự án. Em cũng
mong mình có thể giúp hỗ trợ những người khiếm thị khác để họ có thể có được
công việc yêu thích, và có thể có cuộc sống tốt như em hiện giờ.”
Và dưới đây là nhận
xét từ một khách hàng của Lan trên TripAdvisor:

“Spa
tốt nhất ở Hà Nội.
(michalsimpson)
Ôi,
tôi sẽ không đi tìm nơi nào khác nữa. Cơ sở này quá tuyệt, nhân viên vô cùng
chuyên nghiệp và cực kỳ tử tế. Điều tuyệt nhất chính là spa này là một tổ chức
phi lợi nhuận đào tạo người khiếm thị trẻ thành những trị liệu viên.
Khi họ hoàn tất khóa đào tạo, họ sẽ có cơ hội được việc làm ở spa này, giúp họ
có thể tự chủ được cuộc sống của mình.
Tôi
thử gói dịch vụ trị liệu 2 giờ, và phải nói là rất tuyệt, rất thư giãn.
Bạn
nên gọi trước để đặt chỗ. Điện thoại: 0437739919.
Dễ
tìm, spa ở trong con đường nhỏ sát đài truyền hình: 102 Ngõ 5 B1 Huỳnh Thúc
Kháng, Đống Đa, Hà Nội.

Nhân
tiện, tôi nói thêm là không ai nhờ tôi viết nhận xét này cả. Họ xứng đáng 100%.

Hòa – Nhân viên trị
liệu khiếm thị đến từ Cao Bằng 

Em sinh ra trong một gia đình đông con, trong đó có hai người bị mù lòa. Khi
mới chào đời, chúng em cũng có thể nhìn thấy như những bạn khác. Khi lên hai, em
bị sởi dẫn đến biến chứng mù hoàn toàn. Từ đó, cả hai anh em chúng em phải sống
trong bóng tối. Lúc nhỏ, em chỉ ở nhà, và quanh quẩn trong làng. Em không có
nhiều bạn, cũng không được đi học. Em tủi thân khi thấy bạn bè cùng trang lứa
được đến trường. Em muốn được như các bạn. Khi được 17 tuổi, hội người mù trong
tỉnh cho em một cơ hội được học chữ nổi (Braille).
Ba năm sau, em hỏi mượn tiền bố mẹ để tham gia vào
khóa đào tạo nghề ở thị xã. Đầu tiên, em làm việc ở một cửa hàng tẩm quất của
người bà con trong gần một năm để học các kỹ thuật tẩm quất truyền thống từ các
bạn đồng nghiệp. Sau đó, em chuyển về Hà Nội để tham gia một khóa đào tạo ba
tháng ở Trung tâm Đào tạo và Phục hồi Chức năng cho người mù Việt Nam. Sau khi
học xong, em quyết định ở lại Hà Nội và đã làm qua nhiều quán tẩm quất. Công việc
của em khá vất vả và rủi ro. Giờ làm việc là từ 9 giờ sáng đến nửa đêm, nhưng
nhiều khi em phải làm đến 1 giờ-2 hai giờ sáng. Khách hàng của em chủ yếu là người
dân lao động. Một số người say rượu rất thô lỗ, họ dọa nạt và còn đánh em. Một
người khách có lần còn nghi ngờ em ăn trộm 10 triệu vì ông không thể nhớ đã để
tiền ở đâu. Dù công an đã tuyên bố là em không lấy, em cảm thấy bị tổn thương rất
nhiều vì chuyện này.

Khi em tìm nơi làm việc mới, bạn
em giới thiệu em đến Omamori Spa và Blind-Link. Môi trường làm việc cũng như
các kỹ thuật massage ở Omamori hoàn toàn mới và khá khó với em. Em học các kiểu
massage khác nhau và nỗ lực tập luyện rất nhiều trong ba tháng để được nhận vào
làm ở Omamori từ tháng 7/2014. Dù mức lương hiện tại của em không cao bằng trước
đây, em có rất nhiều cơ hội học tập kiến thức khác nhau. Lần đầu tiên
trong đời, em được học tiếng Anh và học nhiều kỹ thuật massage chuyên nghiệp. Những
lời khen và nhận xét tích cực từ khách hàng khiến em cảm thấy mình được tôn trọng.
Điều đó thực sự rất ý nghĩa với em.

</div></div>","Lochranza Field Studies Centre - Isle Of Arran


''Providing a quality outdoor experience for all - developing an appreciation of the landscape & environment through active involvement''Learning & being active outdoors has substancial benefits to people of all ages, abilities & backgrounds.   Set in a the stunning location on the Isle of Arran, The Lochranza Centre will provide education, activity & general interest holidays available to everyone.
A UNIQUE PLACE
Located on the northend tip of the stunningly beautiful Isle of Arran, on the West Coast of Scotland, Lochranza Field Studies Centre has been providing educational & activity experiences to families & student groups for over 35 years.
The Isle of Arran is often described as 'Scotland in Minature'.  The jewel in its crown is the village of Lochranza.  Nestling in the bottom of a steep sided valley, on the edge of a sea Loch, with the ancient Castle as its focal point, the village is a picture post card location.  Step inside the picture & you will find a landscape which has evolved over thousands of years, created by volcanoes & shaped by rivers, glaciers & the rise & fall of the sea.  
The land is home to golden eagles, red deer, red squirels & badgers.  In the surrounding seas swim seals, otters, dolphins & basking sharks. It's the perfect outdoor classroom to inspire students away from their text books & to experience the natural world.  It's also a wonderful outdoor playground for adventurous or more relaxing activities.

                            


OUR STORY - SO FAROriginally set up as an Independent Field Studies Centre focusing on the Island's superb Geology,  like its surrounding landscape, the Centre has evolved through time to provide a range of educational & activity courses to young people & family groups.
For the last 25 years the Centre has been part of large organisation running education & activity camps thoughout the UK & Europe.  The main company are now focusing growth on larger centres & other markets.  Lochranza's unique location & atmosphere make it very different to any other place.
The current management team at Lochranza (Stuart Blake & Chris Traill) wish to keep the Centre open & buy the business from the current owners, making it once again an Independant Centre placing the needs of its guests first & providing life changing outdoor experiences for everyone.  A PLACE FOR EVERYONEThe business aims to provide a quality outdoor experience regardless of age, ability & background.  A percentage of profits will be invested in a fund to allow people who would otherwise not be able to afford these experiences to have an equal opportunity.
        
MANAGEMENTStuart & Chris - General & Operations Managers - have been in post for a combined total of 55 years. We have a dedicated team of 18 staff some with over 10 years service.  Many of our staff are ex students - inspired by their own experience & returning to pass their enthusiasm & knowledge to others.  We have many school teachers returning to us for over 20 consecutive years.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">We are Genoa and Tandrea, co-founders of Chocolate Siztas, a full-figured events organization based in Northern California. Chocolate Siztas was established in 2007 and our primary focus has been to promote the full-figured community and reflect the positivity within it--while also having some fun.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">Over time, we have grown and changed; so has our focus. Recognizing that there are needs within the full-figured community that need to be addressed, we are transitioning the organization from a for-profit, to a nonprofit one. We want to address the health issues (heart disease, diabetes, morbid obesity, mental health, etc.) that many in our community are facing, as well as the disparity in self-esteem, leadership and positive, accessible role models for our youth.</span></p>
<p>Your contributions to this campaign will help to get the ball rolling to establish the nonprofit and acquire 501(c)(3) status. We have so many hopes, dreams and plans for this organization, so many people that we want to reach and help...but we CANNOT do it without you.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px;"">What's In It For Us &amp; You</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p>First, us. We're asking for $1,250 to cover the costs of a CPA to do the proper paperwork, IRS and state filings to <i>ensure</i> that 501(c)(3) status will be granted. Once we have that status, we will be able to move forward with applying for (and hopefully <i>getting</i>) grants and other funding to continue CS, Inc.'s growth. The nonprofit status will also allow folks to give to us and write the donations off on their taxes.</p>
<p>Second, you. Most people aren't really given the opportunity to get in with a nonprofit organization on the ground floor--we're giving you that opportunity. Any amount given will give you the claim to fame of helping CS, Inc. get started...way back in its infancy! :) A contribution of $10 (or more) will guarantee that a personalized, handwritten thank you note will be mailed to you (if you provide a means to do so), thanking you for your contribution once our goal date has been reached. A gift of $50 (or more)  will also allow your name to be inscribed on a plaque that will hang on the walls of CS, Inc. as an initial investor for the organization. </p>
<p>ALL funds given (up to the $1,250 requested) will go directly to the CPA who is helping us set up CS, Inc. Any additional monies (which would be AWESOME &amp; AMAZING!!) will go toward start-up costs (office space, marketing, etc.) for the organization. We are sincerely grateful for ANY amount that you can give.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We want you to dream with us and dream as big as we do. Ultimately, CS, Inc. would like to create programs that can be duplicated all over the state, country and even the world (told you we dream big!). We want to start with our communities and change the lives of people in ways that will cause ripples that will touch others. The full-figured community is powerful, accomplished, intelligent, positive, awesome, amazing. We want to reflect all of those things by bringing awareness, building self-esteem, encouraging leadership and educating others. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It all starts with a single step, though, and this is ours.</span></p>

</div><div> <p>We understand and that's okay because you can help in other ways. You would do us a great service by just spreading the word about us and what we're trying to do. Please, tell your friends and family, forward emails, post on your social media, send text messages. Make some noise about us, raise a ruckus, disturb the peace! :) Send smoke signals, carrier pigeons and messages in bottles and/or balloons. We're not against blimp messages or skywriting either.

Recognizing that there are needs within the full-figured community that need to be addressed, we are transitioning the organization from a for-profit, to a nonprofit one. We want to address the health issues (heart disease, diabetes, morbid obesity, mental health, etc.) that many in our community are facing, as well as the disparity in self-esteem, leadership and positive, accessible role models for our youth.
Your contributions to this campaign will help to get the ball rolling to establish the nonprofit and acquire 501(c)(3) status. We have so many hopes, dreams and plans for this organization, so many people that we want to reach and help...but we CANNOT do it without you.

What's In It For Us & You

 First, us. We're asking for $1,250 to cover the costs of a CPA to do the proper paperwork, IRS and state filings to ensure that 501(c)(3) status will be granted. Once we have that status, we will be able to move forward with applying for (and hopefully getting) grants and other funding to continue CS, Inc.'s growth. The nonprofit status will also allow folks to give to us and write the donations off on their taxes.
Second, you. Most people aren't really given the opportunity to get in with a nonprofit organization on the ground floor--we're giving you that opportunity. Any amount given will give you the claim to fame of helping CS, Inc. get started...way back in its infancy! :) A contribution of $10 (or more) will guarantee that a personalized, handwritten thank you note will be mailed to you (if you provide a means to do so), thanking you for your contribution once our goal date has been reached. A gift of $50 (or more)  will also allow your name to be inscribed on a plaque that will hang on the walls of CS, Inc. as an initial investor for the organization. 
ALL funds given (up to the $1,250 requested) will go directly to the CPA who is helping us set up CS, Inc. Any additional monies (which would be AWESOME & AMAZING!!) will go toward start-up costs (office space, marketing, etc.) for the organization. We are sincerely grateful for ANY amount that you can give.
The Impact
 We want you to dream with us and dream as big as we do. Ultimately, CS, Inc. would like to create programs that can be duplicated all over the state, country and even the world (told you we dream big!). We want to start with our communities and change the lives of people in ways that will cause ripples that will touch others. The full-figured community is powerful, accomplished, intelligent, positive, awesome, amazing. We want to reflect all of those things by bringing awareness, building self-esteem, encouraging leadership and educating others. 
It all starts with a single step, though, and this is ours.
Unable to Give?
 We understand and that's okay because you can help in other ways. You would do us a great service by just spreading the word about us and what we're trying to do. Please, tell your friends and family, forward emails, post on your social media, send text messages. Make some noise about us, raise a ruckus, disturb the peace! :) Send smoke signals, carrier pigeons and messages in bottles and/or balloons. We're not against blimp messages or skywriting either. NO shame here! :) Please, support us in any way that you can.
Indiegogo even makes it easy for you with tools that allow you to share our campaign.

matter how small we may feel if we persevere in life we can go further than we
ever thought possible, aimed at children 7-11 years.</p>
<p>Based on
the theme of my novel I have created an accompanying guided reading,
comprehension and PHSE workbook, co written with Diana Mendonca, head of
literacy in my local primary school. The workbook is for use at home or in the
classroom, and highlights the important message contained in my book,
helping to equip children with the tools need to be determined in reaching
their dreams/goals, whilst covering important curriculum based literacy.</p>
<p>I love
visiting schools, running inspiring workshops, reading to the kids and
encouraging them to read more and to become determined dreamers like Ernie.
During my visits I am often asked to sell signed copies of my book and workbook
for the kids to take home with them, a great way to get kids and parents
engaged in reading and learning together. At present I usually have to take
orders for the book prior to my visit; however I would love to have resources

<p>* A

<p>* Plus if
I sell all of my pledges I will raise over and above my target amount. This
will be used to buy Ernie books and workbooks to send to the Hillsong Africa
Foundation - Read Baby Read project, to help improve literacy in Africa. </p>
<p>Having an
aspiration or dream in life is incredible important, however many children just
don't know the value that their dreams hold or fully understand the mental

understanding those tools and developing a good attitude needed to succeed in
life.</p>

<li>Place at least 25-30 students in technology jobs by end of the year.</li>
<li>Customize the training curriculum to fit individual needs</li>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Across the technology sector, there is a major disparity between men and women. While 57% of occupations in the workforce are held by women, in computing occupations that figure is only 25%. This disparity is present at the college level as well. In 2010, although 57% of undergraduate degree recipients were female, but only 14% of them received computer science degrees at major research universities. Incredibly, this number has actually fallen in the recent years.</p>
<p>This disparity hurts the technology companies themselves. Research shows that women's choices impact up to 85% of purchasing decisions. By some analyses, they account for $4.3 trillion of the total U.S. consumer spending of $5.9 trillion, making women the largest single economic force not just in United States, but in the World.</p>
<p>The tech industry pays an annual wage of $93,800 which is 98% more than the average private sector wage. There are expected to be 1.4 million job openings for computer specialists by 2020. One would hope that women would be eligible for more than 25% of these future high-paying job openings.</p>

Currently, women make up to only 10% of the engineering discipline when it comes to the top 500 companies. <p></p>
<p><b>90% of schools still don't teach computer science</b></p>
<div>With the current technology trend, 9 out of 10 schools still don't offer Computer Science courses. Even when they do, they are not anywhere close to preparing students for the real industry challenges. With the competition today, it gets harder and harder to crack the technical interview and stand out among all the other qualified candidates.</div>

and more...Why do we need the fund?
With our 10 years of training, we've built some amazing courses that has a proven history of getting students into jobs. Now we need your help to bring these courses to more students, scale and reach out to more women, keep it up to date with the ever changing technology, and add more courses to the curriculum.
As non-profit organization, we are incredibly cost-effective. We have 1% administrative costs. Money that is being requested is purely to train more teachers and enhance the curriculum to place more and more qualified women in jobs.
So, every dollar you donate will be used only to expand our programs and reach to more women in technology that are dying to get into this field.
We also need your help in spreading the word! Currently our mission is being accomplished by folks like you that are interested in bringing more women to technology by spreading the word.
What we need?
Our goal is to:


Train 2 teachers with professional background in the field
Place at least 25-30 students in technology jobs by end of the year.
Customize the training curriculum to fit individual needs


We need at least 50,000$ for this.

The Impact
Across the technology sector, there is a major disparity between men and women. While 57% of occupations in the workforce are held by women, in computing occupations that figure is only 25%. This disparity is present at the college level as well. In 2010, although 57% of undergraduate degree recipients were female, but only 14% of them received computer science degrees at major research universities. Incredibly, this number has actually fallen in the recent years.
This disparity hurts the technology companies themselves. Research shows that women's choices impact up to 85% of purchasing decisions. By some analyses, they account for $4.3 trillion of the total U.S. consumer spending of $5.9 trillion, making women the largest single economic force not just in United States, but in the World.
The tech industry pays an annual wage of $93,800 which is 98% more than the average private sector wage. There are expected to be 1.4 million job openings for computer specialists by 2020. One would hope that women would be eligible for more than 25% of these future high-paying job openings.
Let's start by looking at some numbersClearly we have a numbers problem, that as Kristine Snow President of Cisco Systems Capital describes as, ""a situation that does not optimize a diversity of ideas, innovation and ultimately a business's bottom line."" Currently, women make up to only 10% of the engineering discipline when it comes to the top 500 companies. 
90% of schools still don't teach computer science
With the current technology trend, 9 out of 10 schools still don't offer Computer Science courses. Even when they do, they are not anywhere close to preparing students for the real industry challenges. With the competition today, it gets harder and harder to crack the technical interview and stand out among all the other qualified candidates.

The business opens an account on Tunga and links to its projects/repositories on Github. On its personal dashboard, the business can then see its outstanding issues (tasks) in the form of cards.</p><p>2. By clicking on a card the business can pledge money on the issue. At that moment it becomes a ‘pledged task’, which means it will be visible to workers. </p><p>3. Each worker has a dashboard with an ‘activity stream’ with task cards that fit his or her competencies and interests. The stream can be filtered based on skills, etc. The worker can also follow businesses and projects, whose tasks then always appear in his or her stream.</p><p>4. The worker can click on a task to work on it. It will take him/her to the Github website where the work is actually done.</p><p>5.

Before we spend a truckload of money building the Tunga platform, we first want to ensure that our setup lives up to the enthusiasm we’ve met so far. That's why we're focused on raising the first $6000, so that we can do <b>a substantial number of pilot tests</b> (at least 40 tasks at $120 plus some out of pocket costs). Here's how you can help:</p><p><b>1. Give us your coding tasks and let our developers show you their skills. </b></p><p>We are looking for <b>startups, social enterprises, NGOs and corporations</b> that want to support this initiative and help us generate a substantial batch of tasks for the Tunga community. It's simple, just <b>support this Indiegogo campaign, and claim your perk</b> by letting us know which Github issues you would like our developers to work on.

</ul><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p></p><p><b>Q: What is the main difference between Tunga and traditional freelancer marketplaces like Elance-oDesk (now Upwork)?</b></p><p>A: There are two main differences: firstly, hiring freelancers the traditional way and then having them collaborate within your existing workflow requires quite some work and planning from your own side. On the other hand, because Tunga is not set up as a marketplace but as a social network, it is as simple as entering an amount and clicking a button. As a result, the on-demand and cost-efficient outsourcing of even the smallest issues and bug-fixes becomes possible .</p><p>Secondly, most traditional freelancer marketplaces have no particular focus on Africa, whereas Tunga operates from East-Africa and has community managers that are actively in contact with the local developer scene. This allows Tunga to unlock a major pool of largely untapped talent for you.</p><p></p><p><b>Q: I don't want my code to be public. Does Tunga work with private repositories?</b></p><p>A: Yes. You are the one who decides to whom you give access to your private repositories and under what conditions.</p><p></p><p><b>Q: I am not in the software business, but think it's a cool project. Can I just support it without having to participate in the pilot program?</b></p><p>A: Of course! Your support is very useful and also very much appreciated. We can use it to further develop the platform using the input from the pilot program.</p><p><b>Q: How do I determine how many hours an issue is?</b></p><p>A: We are looking for pilot participants that are already familiar with software development and Git. We believe you can make a good estimation based on your own experience. In the end, the amount of enthusiasm among developers to work on your issue is a good indication of how accurate your estimation of the required hours is :-)</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Q: Is there anyone at Tunga to provide support to ensure good communication with the developers and steady progress?</b></p><p>A: We have community managers in Uganda and Kenya. They will make sure that the communication goes smoothly between you and the developer(s). All communication goes via the Github interface, this way you can easily track all communication concerning an issue.</p><b>Q: How do I know if my task will be completed on time?</b><p>A: The goal of the pilot is finding out what the platform should look like in the end. This means that during the pilot we will do manually, what the platform will facilitate automatically in the future. Once you have supported this campaign, one of our community managers will contact you to discuss your needs. If you have a strict deadline, they will make an assessment whether it is feasible, and make sure the developers that will work on your task are aware of the deadline.</p><p>That said, given the fact that this is a pilot, we cannot give any guarantees. This is a learning process for everybody, so in any case it is advised to not have them work on your most complex and crucial issues at this stage.</p><b>Q: What about the quality of the work that the developers deliver?</b><p>A: The coders who participate in this pilot are all skilled and experienced developers. The quality control is part of how you always work in Github. If it works, you merge, if it does not work or the code needs modifications, you can drop a comment in the Github interface. The developers then modify or work further based on your feedback.</p><p></p><p><b>Q: I am interested but I am not familiar with Git, can I still join?</b><br/></p><p>A: For the pilot program we are looking for participants that are familiar with Git. If you have in-house expertise that is experienced with the Git(hub) workflow, you should try Tunga. In the future, Tunga might also connect to other workflow tools (e.g. scrum-based).</p><p><b>Q: How do I pay the developer(s) that work on my issue?</b></p><p>A: The only thing you need to do is selecting one of the perk packages ranging from 100$ to $1000 dollar. Based on your perk package our developers will work on your issue(s) for up to the number of hours specified in the perk description. We will take care of the distribution of the money.</p><p><b>Q: What do I need to provide (e.g. context, explanation) so that the developer can work on a particular issue?</b></p><p>A: Just write issues like you always do in Github. Check <a href=""https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-write-our-github-issues/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this article</a> on how to write good Github issues. Also, it is always advisable to include 'etiquette' guidelines in your repository, as described in <a href=""http://www.defmacro.org/2013/04/03/issue-etiquette.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this article</a>.</p><p><b>Q: Will I easily be able to communicate with the developers in Africa?  Are the developers reachable during my business hours? </b></p><p>A: All communication between you and the developer(s) goes through the Github interface. At the same time we can monitor your communication. So, if there is any discussion we can intervene and collaboratively solve the matter. There is only a one hour time difference between Europe and East Africa, so office hours are more or less the same. That said, we know a lot of coders who tend to work outside office hours :)</p><p><b>Q: What is your conflict resolution policy? For example, what happens if I don't want to pay for the task because it is not done properly or in time? </b></p><p>A: Since this is a pilot, we will definitely run into situations where unforeseen things happen, or either side is disappointed with the outcome. It is our intention to handle each assignment in a fair way. If you are not satisfied with how things are going, please let us know.</p><p>In the end, if you feel that the agreed result is not delivered, we will make sure that either someone else will do the work or you will get reimbursed. On the other hand, if we can establish that the developer has put in the time and effort, since this is a pilot, our intention is to pay him or her anyway.</p><p>In the future, Tunga will work with reputation metrics that will help establish the trustworthiness of both the businesses and the developers. Such a reputation system will also incentivize good behavior on both sides.</p><p></p></div>","Hack your software development workflow Do you have a chronic shortage of good software developers? Are you familiar with Git, or even better, do you host projects on Github? Then this groundbreaking project is for you.Tunga is a platform that seamlessly connects skilled software developers in Africa to paid software projects from around the world. It will not only give you flexible and hassle-free access to a pool of qualified developers, but it will also enable you to meaningfully empower talented and motivated people throughout Africa.Tunga is the brain-child (with a big heart) of social innovation studio Butterfly Works and Dutch tech startup Mobbr. They've joined forces with the coding community in Kenya and Uganda to build this powerful software tasks platform. This newly formed startup will operate from East Africa to ensure support  and clear communication with our developer community. Unlike traditional freelance marketplaces Tunga is set up as a social network, which makes it possible to mobilize the labor you require on-demand and directly integrate it into your workflow.Sound promising? Here's how it will work...Tunga allows businesses to build a following of on-demand workers to work on their software projects, and it allows talented software developers from Africa to have access to interesting and well-paid work anytime and any place.Here is the flow we envision:1. The business opens an account on Tunga and links to its projects/repositories on Github. On its personal dashboard, the business can then see its outstanding issues (tasks) in the form of cards.2. By clicking on a card the business can pledge money on the issue. At that moment it becomes a ‘pledged task’, which means it will be visible to workers. 3. Each worker has a dashboard with an ‘activity stream’ with task cards that fit his or her competencies and interests. The stream can be filtered based on skills, etc. The worker can also follow businesses and projects, whose tasks then always appear in his or her stream.4. The worker can click on a task to work on it. It will take him/her to the Github website where the work is actually done.5. Once the work is accepted, the issue is closed by the business and the pledged money will be distributed among all workers who contributed to it, in line with the value of their contribution.With Tunga, everyone wins!As a business, you can create your own on-demand workforce, who can just hook into your existing workflow. You pay for results and not by the hour. You can build lasting relationships with a network of coders. And you get access to a large pool of untapped potential, which is otherwise hard for you to reach.As a talented coder from Africa, you get access to work that is well-paid and that matches your expertise and interests. You can work anytime anyplace you want. You are not being judged by where you come from, but by the quality of your work. You can work in a democratic and transparent environment. And you can be part of an international community of peers and professionals.Our story Ernesto Spruyt, co-founder of Mobbr: ""We at Mobbr experienced the shortage of skilled software developers first hand. We turned to crowdsourcing and  spent more than €40.000 on software development using Github with our own payment solution.""**Check this tutorial to see how that works in practice:""While we were able to get the technical results we were looking for, the experience left us wanting, because we missed social functionality with an on-demand community. Then we met the people from Butterfly Works, who have been involved in training African coders since the year 2000. They had a growing community of talented software developers eager for work. By combining forces we saw the potential to fill an expanding void in the market, while at the same time creating opportunities in a region of the world with vast untapped potential.""""Together we worked for months to gather the building blocks for this project. We visited Kenya and Uganda this summer to make an assessment of the feasibility of our idea. We were impressed by the vibrant coding community in both countries--so many talented  people who can't wait to get involved!""Here's how you can help...We have already completed successful pilot-assignments in which developers from Uganda have been collaborating on paid Github issues. Now we need to ramp this up. Before we spend a truckload of money building the Tunga platform, we first want to ensure that our setup lives up to the enthusiasm we’ve met so far. That's why we're focused on raising the first $6000, so that we can do a substantial number of pilot tests (at least 40 tasks at $120 plus some out of pocket costs). Here's how you can help:1. Give us your coding tasks and let our developers show you their skills. We are looking for startups, social enterprises, NGOs and corporations that want to support this initiative and help us generate a substantial batch of tasks for the Tunga community. It's simple, just support this Indiegogo campaign, and claim your perk by letting us know which Github issues you would like our developers to work on. We will send them there, monitor the progress together with you and take care of the payment to the developers afterwards.2. Donate to help us build the prototype.So far, we've designed the first version of Tunga.  We need at least $20.000 to develop the working prototype. With your help we can build Tunga. Your donation at any pledge level can make a difference for the future of our developers.3. Spread the word.Whether you can donate to our campaign or not, you can still help to make Tunga a reality.

<p>Why do American students and graduates know so little about our country’s history?   2015 data shows that only between 18 and 27 percent of students scored ""proficient"" or ""higher"" in the areas of U.S. history, geography, and civics.

<p>Hi, my name is Dick Gustafson, the author and voice of <i>Spirit of '76–Renewed </i> an abridged history of the founding of the United States of America from its colonization to its recent past.<br/>
</p>
<p>The ongoing mission behind the development of this story has been to re-introduce students and adults alike to the founding fathers and protectors of America. I believe that giving students a bird’s eye view of America’s timeline is a winning approach for comprehending and retaining facts about history.  I want to help our country's children know our past so that they can make educated decisions as adults to guide America's future.<br/></p>
<h4 align=""center"">
<span style=""font-weight: 100;"">Available Now</span><strong><br/>
<i>Spirit of '76–Renewed </i> – Standard eBook Edition</strong>
</h4>
<p>The <i>Spirit of ’76–Renewed </i>  e-book is an abridged history of the founding of the United States of America from its colonization to its recent past. This journey of American politics touches on many milestones including The Revolution, the Declaration of Independence, the founding of the U.S. Constitution, and the stories and music of our patriots and presidents who have influenced the direction of America through the decades.  The ongoing mission behind the development of this multimedia-based presentation has been to re-introduce students, teachers and patriots alike to our founding fathers and protectors of America.</p>
<p>The <i>Spirit of ‘76</i> includes insight into the personalities, beliefs, inspirations, actions, motives and important events behind our country’s patriots. The presentation includes many U.S. history highlights with numerous supporting Internet links to explore the details behind the people and events that have guided our nation.</p>
<p>The story has been continually evolving since its conception. From the start it was my vision to present the story in the narrative. In 2008 I completed this narrative with period music as an audio CD presentation. But with discs becoming less prominent as a presentation medium, the story as a physical medium was shelved. Instead I spent time finding photos and supporting Internet links to transform my story into an interactive multimedia experience. Just recently I published the presentation as an e-book in EPUB, MOBI, and iBook formats.</p>
<p>Because the Internet is always changing, broken or dead links occur over time. The Internet links in this e-book are dynamically updated from the <a href=""http://www.spiritof76renewed.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spiritof76renewed.org</a> website. The web links are constructed in this way so that readers will always have references that are reliable and up-to-date.</p>
<p>But the story’s journey is not entirely finished. In the near future, I plan to release an enhanced version of the e-book presentation in the Apple iBook format. This enhanced version will offer everything that is in the current version of the e-book but adds the spoken word with patriotic music as the instrumental background. In this edition a few of the 76 music performance vignettes are read as poetry. Often lyrics are learned by rote, overlooking their significance, resulting in the loss of their true meaning.</p>
<p>My goal is to inspire and inform Americans of all ages about the importance of the American miracle and to build a new sense of pride and patriotism for our country. I hope to continue my mission to fill all readers with a renewed spirit of ’76.</p>

<p>With your help soon I will be able to release the enhanced edition of <i>Spirit of '76–Renewed </i> that includes narrative &amp; music.   This enhanced version adds the spoken word with patriotic background music to the written eBook.  It's been some time since I completed the narrative.  Back then my voice had a great delivery.  Parkinson's has affected my voice, but not my spirit. I put my heart and soul into those recordings and now, with your help, I hope to raise the necessary resources to share this story with the world.  I  am looking forward to the support and enthusiasm from the community to take the story to its final plateau.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, I have also been working on other important and interesting stories and developing new and cleaver ways to make them interesting.<br/></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Old Glory - A History of the American Flag</strong><br/>
This is a story of a proud flag.  Her name is Old Glory. This flag tells a story of a nation, a people, and an idea...  A powerful idea that guarantees all men the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  An idea that gives us the right to live in freedom, to share the gift of liberty—with dignity.  Old Glory is the symbol of that idea.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong> The History of World Slavery </strong><br/>
This is a story about  a very unpleasant part of our world's history. The subject is Slavery. If it is so unpleasant, why bring it up? Because slavery has never disappeared. It goes back over ten-thousand years and still exists today. Some say that bringing up slavery exposes our worst side;  man's inhumanity to man. Why do we let slavery exist? This story hopes to unveil the reasons why slavery has always been and continues to be a part of our world culture, and to bring to light all of the reasons why it is so wrong.<br/>

<strong>The Development of an e-Learning website for Teachers and Students</strong><br/>
I have been working with a very talented group of web developers who have integrated my narrative story into an online e-learning site.  I hope that these and other stories are a new resource for teachers, as well as an inspiration for students across this country.

And, these statistics have changed very little for some time now. 
Perhaps we are cramming too many facts into our children’s heads, instead of inspiring them with stories that let our students visualize the journey.




Hi, my name is Dick Gustafson, the author and voice of Spirit of '76–Renewed  an abridged history of the founding of the United States of America from its colonization to its recent past.

The ongoing mission behind the development of this story has been to re-introduce students and adults alike to the founding fathers and protectors of America. I believe that giving students a bird’s eye view of America’s timeline is a winning approach for comprehending and retaining facts about history.  I want to help our country's children know our past so that they can make educated decisions as adults to guide America's future.

Available Now
Spirit of '76–Renewed  – Standard eBook Edition

The Spirit of ’76–Renewed   e-book is an abridged history of the founding of the United States of America from its colonization to its recent past. This journey of American politics touches on many milestones including The Revolution, the Declaration of Independence, the founding of the U.S. Constitution, and the stories and music of our patriots and presidents who have influenced the direction of America through the decades.  The ongoing mission behind the development of this multimedia-based presentation has been to re-introduce students, teachers and patriots alike to our founding fathers and protectors of America.
The Spirit of ‘76 includes insight into the personalities, beliefs, inspirations, actions, motives and important events behind our country’s patriots. The presentation includes many U.S. history highlights with numerous supporting Internet links to explore the details behind the people and events that have guided our nation.
The story has been continually evolving since its conception. From the start it was my vision to present the story in the narrative. In 2008 I completed this narrative with period music as an audio CD presentation. But with discs becoming less prominent as a presentation medium, the story as a physical medium was shelved. Instead I spent time finding photos and supporting Internet links to transform my story into an interactive multimedia experience. Just recently I published the presentation as an e-book in EPUB, MOBI, and iBook formats.
Because the Internet is always changing, broken or dead links occur over time. The Internet links in this e-book are dynamically updated from the spiritof76renewed.org website. The web links are constructed in this way so that readers will always have references that are reliable and up-to-date.
But the story’s journey is not entirely finished. In the near future, I plan to release an enhanced version of the e-book presentation in the Apple iBook format. This enhanced version will offer everything that is in the current version of the e-book but adds the spoken word with patriotic music as the instrumental background. In this edition a few of the 76 music performance vignettes are read as poetry. Often lyrics are learned by rote, overlooking their significance, resulting in the loss of their true meaning.
My goal is to inspire and inform Americans of all ages about the importance of the American miracle and to build a new sense of pride and patriotism for our country. I hope to continue my mission to fill all readers with a renewed spirit of ’76.


Soon to be released
Spirit of '76–Renewed  (Enhanced eBook Edition 
with Narrative & Music)
With your help soon I will be able to release the enhanced edition of Spirit of '76–Renewed  that includes narrative & music.   This enhanced version adds the spoken word with patriotic background music to the written eBook.  It's been some time since I completed the narrative.  Back then my voice had a great delivery.  Parkinson's has affected my voice, but not my spirit. I put my heart and soul into those recordings and now, with your help, I hope to raise the necessary resources to share this story with the world.  I  am looking forward to the support and enthusiasm from the community to take the story to its final plateau.

 
Additional Projects on the Horizon
Other History Stories & Ways to Tell Them

Over the last few years, I have also been working on other important and interesting stories and developing new and cleaver ways to make them interesting.

Old Glory - A History of the American Flag
This is a story of a proud flag.  Her name is Old Glory. This flag tells a story of a nation, a people, and an idea...  A powerful idea that guarantees all men the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  An idea that gives us the right to live in freedom, to share the gift of liberty—with dignity.  Old Glory is the symbol of that idea.



 The History of World Slavery 
This is a story about  a very unpleasant part of our world's history. The subject is Slavery. If it is so unpleasant, why bring it up? Because slavery has never disappeared. It goes back over ten-thousand years and still exists today. Some say that bringing up slavery exposes our worst side;  man's inhumanity to man. Why do we let slavery exist? This story hopes to unveil the reasons why slavery has always been and continues to be a part of our world culture, and to bring to light all of the reasons why it is so wrong.



The Development of an e-Learning website for Teachers and Students
I have been working with a very talented group of web developers who have integrated my narrative story into an online e-learning site.  I hope that these and other stories are a new resource for teachers, as well as an inspiration for students across this country.

During a debating competition that was then happening, for a reason we still don’t know, we decided that, maybe, if we join our efforts, just for the competition of course; we could win and bring pride to our class. And yes, we did it!

<h2>ОВА Е НАШАТА ПРИКАЗНА</h2>
<p>За прв пат се сретнавме во 2009 година за време на нашите додипломски студии во политички науки кога и станавме колешки. Нашите компетитивни духови не доведоа до тоа воопшто да не се сакаме на самиот почеток. Напротив, се третиравме една со друга како најголем ривали во стекнување на биди-најдобар-студент титулата, која пак постоеше само во нашите глави. За време на еден натпревар во дебатирање кој се случуваше тогаш, од причина која сѐ уште не ја знаеме, решивме дека, можеби, ако ги здружиме нашите сили, секако, само за дебатниот натпревар, ќе успееме да победиме и да бидеме гордост на нашиот клас. И да, го сторивме тоа! Не само што бевме наградени за најдобри оратори од вкупно 80 учесници, туку и добивме награда за еден од три најдобри дебатерски тимови!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439130962/syjs3ypvx06mgtgqmqxe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ова беше искуство кое ни го промени животот, искуство кое ни ги отвори очите. И тогаш беше моментот кога сфативме дека, да, <b><i>„секоја од нас сама бргу се движи, но само заедно можеме да стигнеме далеку“</i></b>.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Тогаш заеднички тргнавме на животно патување во градење на нашиот сон, притоа не дозволувајќи им на другите да нѐ ангажираат во градење на нивниот сон. Како личности со исклучителна жед за знаење, се запишавме на магистерски студии во политички науки на Централноевропскиот универзитет во Будимпешта, Унгарија, каде не само што станавме повторно колешки, туку и цимерки, најдобри пријателки, сестри, и психолог една на друга кога беше потребно. Останувавме будни агонизирајќи во 05:00 часот наутро додека ги пишувавме нашите <a href=""http://politicalscience.ceu.edu/ma-theses-submitted-department"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">тези</a>, и од време на време се спасувавме една со друга од академски емоционални крахирања.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">По нашето враќање во Македонија, а поради нашиот сериозен и енергичен ангажман во невладиниот сектор, бевме назначени на клучни позиции во една <a href=""http://www.jef.eu/members/national-sections/jef-macedonia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">граѓанска организација</a>, притоа вложувајќи ги сите наши напори за унапредување на себе сѝ и македонското општество. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Залагајќи се за континуирано себе-унапредување и образување во полето на лидерството, а со цел стекнување лидерски вештини кои ќе ги примениме за општото добро, аплициравме на <a href=""http://pglinstitute.org/?page_id=1296"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Летната Школа</a> на престижниот <a href=""http://pglinstitute.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Институт за Подготовка на Глобални Лидери</a>, која се одржува во Август во Струга, Македонија. Станува збор за интернационална Летна Школа организирана од страна на Институтот за Подготовка на Глобални Лидери, а водена од <a href=""http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/potolics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sam J Potolicchio</a>, професор на престижниот Џорџтаун универзитет во Њу Јорк, САД. Целта на летната школа е да  опреми млади професионалци со алатките кои се од огромно значење за лидерите на 21-от век. Дотолку повеќе, летната школа не само што ни овозможува стекнување на знаење кое не може да се прочита во ниту една книга, туку претставува и уникатна можност за воспоставување соработка со млади и страсни професионалци од повеќе од 75 земји од светот!</p><p></p>
<h2>ЗОШТО НИ Е ПОТРЕБНА ПОМОШ</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Со оглед на успешноста на нашите апликации, нѝ беше понудено место за Летната Школа и стипендија која покрива 80% од целокупната школарина за учество. Во обезбедување на останатите 20% би се потпреле на нашите лични приходи, но, и покрај тоа што сме магистрандки и поседуваме искуство во нашата област, сѐ уште сме во фазата на барање работа. Исто така, би се потпреле и на финансиската поддршка на нашите родители, но, земајќи ги предвид нивните месечни плати [во просек: 390 долари нето] од една страна, и месечните трошоци за живот во Македонија [во просек: 530 долари] од друга страна, и оваа опција останува невозможна.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Токму сета оваа ситуација ни стана иронична затоа што <b>само 20% од целокупната школарина</b> не спречуваат да учествуваме во структуирана програма за лидерство која ќе ни ги даде алатките со помош на кои би можеле да се унапредиме себе сѝ како женски лидери во овој комплексен свет. Во еден момент си рековме дека <b>образованието не смее да биде скапо токму затоа што е бесценето!</b> Поради тоа, прибегнавме кон земање заем, додека истовремено и со огромна надеж ги вложувавме нашите напори за изнаоѓање на финансиска поддршка која ќе ги покрие истите. И покрај тоа, ги исцрпевме сите можно извори, но – безуспешно. Сега, доколку не успееме да ги обезбедиме останатите 20% од школарината, ќе имаме многу тежок период во враќање на нашите позајмици.</p>
<p>Тоа е причината поради која бараме ваша помош. Секој цент е важен!</p>

</div></div>","INTROWe all love being leaders. We love the smell of success that leadership brings to us, the feeling of empowerment and importance, the personal satisfaction, the inner peace, and, happiness. Self-education through the zillion opportunities that the internet gives us nowadays is one way to learn for how to be a leader. This type of education about leadership does have so many challenges, and structured educative programs on leadership have a special challenge – tuition costs.We are a team of passionate, enthusiastic and life-embracing youngsters from Macedonia who immensely need your help in raising money for the prestigious Preparing Global Leaders Institute’ Summer School. We barely ever ask for money. It makes us feel uncomfortable, even bad given the great financial issues that thousands of people experience on a daily basis. But we do have a dream – we want to make a difference. And that’s what made us lose our comfort zone and ask you, good people, to help us.THIS IS OUR STORYWe met for the first time in 2009, during our undergraduate studies in political science where we became classmates. Our competitive spirits led us to not liking each other at all at the very beginning, but treat each other as the biggest rivals in reaching the be-the-best-student title existing only in our heads. During a debating competition that was then happening, for a reason we still don’t know, we decided that, maybe, if we join our efforts, just for the competition of course; we could win and bring pride to our class. And yes, we did it! We were not only awarded the best orators out of 80 competitors, but we were also awarded as one of the three best debating teams.This was a life changing experience, a wide-eye-opener for both of us. It was then that we came to realize that yes, ""we do go fast alone, but it is together that we can go far"". Since then, we embarked on our journey to building our dream, and not let others hire us in building theirs. Being extremely thirsty for knowledge, we both enrolled in master studies in political science at the Central European University, Budapest, Hungary where we became not only classmates, but also room-mates, best friends, sisters, and each other’s psychologist when needed. We were staying awake and agonizing in 5 a.m. while writing our theses, and from time to time saving each other from academic emotional breakdowns. Upon our return in Macedonia and due to our arduous engagement in the NGO sector, we took key positions in one NGO, while doing all the best in making ourselves and our society grow further.Striving for continuous self-improvement so as to equip with leadership skills which we can employ for the greater good, we applied to the Preparing Global Leaders Institute' 2015 Summer School that will take place in August in Struga, Macedonia. It is an international Summer School organized by the Preparing Global Leaders Institute and led by Sam J Potolicchio, a professor at the prestigious Georgetown University, New York. Its aim is to equip young professionals with the tools which are of immense importance for 21 century leaders. What is more, it not only endows us with knowledge that cannot be boxed in books, but it is also a unique opportunity to establish relationships with young and passionate professionals from more than 75 countries! WHY WE NEED YOUR HELPAs our applications have been successful, we have been offered place for the Summer School and a partial scholarship that covers 80% of our participation. We would have relied on are salaries, however, albeit us having master’s degrees and experience in our field, we are still in the job-hunting phase. We would have also relied on are parents’ financial support, nonetheless taking into consideration their monthly salaries [on average: $390 net] on the one hand, and the monthly living expenses in Macedonia on the other [on average: $530], this option appeared to be impossible.Yet we found it ironic that only 20% of the entire amount is preventing us from a structured program on leadership which will provide us with the tools we need to cultivate ourselves as female leaders in this complex world. We thought that education must not be expensive for it is priceless! For that matter, we took loans, while simultaneously and hopingly employing all our efforts in finding a financial support that will cover them. That notwithstanding, we exhausted all potential sources – unsuccessfully. And now, unless we don’t manage to acquire the residual 20%, we will have very hard time in paying back our loans.That is why we are asking for your help. Every little bit counts! We whole-heartedly ask you to help us walk a mile closer to our goal! Thank you so much for the read and your support.WHAT YOU GET IN RETURNYour philanthropy makes enormous difference to us and that is why we want you involved in more ways than just money. We have put together several amazing perks:

Everything that we raise beyond our goal will be donated to the Preparing Global Leaders Institute so that some of the next year participants will not need to walk the hard way.

Како личности со исклучителна жед за знаење, се запишавме на магистерски студии во политички науки на Централноевропскиот универзитет во Будимпешта, Унгарија, каде не само што станавме повторно колешки, туку и цимерки, најдобри пријателки, сестри, и психолог една на друга кога беше потребно. Останувавме будни агонизирајќи во 05:00 часот наутро додека ги пишувавме нашите тези, и од време на време се спасувавме една со друга од академски емоционални крахирања.

По нашето враќање во Македонија, а поради нашиот сериозен и енергичен ангажман во невладиниот сектор, бевме назначени на клучни позиции во една граѓанска организација, притоа вложувајќи ги сите наши напори за унапредување на себе сѝ и македонското општество. 
Залагајќи се за континуирано себе-унапредување и образување во полето на лидерството, а со цел стекнување лидерски вештини кои ќе ги примениме за општото добро, аплициравме на Летната Школа на престижниот Институт за Подготовка на Глобални Лидери, која се одржува во Август во Струга, Македонија. Станува збор за интернационална Летна Школа организирана од страна на Институтот за Подготовка на Глобални Лидери, а водена од Sam J Potolicchio, професор на престижниот Џорџтаун универзитет во Њу Јорк, САД. Целта на летната школа е да  опреми млади професионалци со алатките кои се од огромно значење за лидерите на 21-от век. Дотолку повеќе, летната школа не само што ни овозможува стекнување на знаење кое не може да се прочита во ниту една книга, туку претставува и уникатна можност за воспоставување соработка со млади и страсни професионалци од повеќе од 75 земји од светот!
ЗОШТО НИ Е ПОТРЕБНА ПОМОШ
Со оглед на успешноста на нашите апликации, нѝ беше понудено место за Летната Школа и стипендија која покрива 80% од целокупната школарина за учество. Во обезбедување на останатите 20% би се потпреле на нашите лични приходи, но, и покрај тоа што сме магистрандки и поседуваме искуство во нашата област, сѐ уште сме во фазата на барање работа. Исто така, би се потпреле и на финансиската поддршка на нашите родители, но, земајќи ги предвид нивните месечни плати [во просек: 390 долари нето] од една страна, и месечните трошоци за живот во Македонија [во просек: 530 долари] од друга страна, и оваа опција останува невозможна.
Токму сета оваа ситуација ни стана иронична затоа што само 20% од целокупната школарина не спречуваат да учествуваме во структуирана програма за лидерство која ќе ни ги даде алатките со помош на кои би можеле да се унапредиме себе сѝ како женски лидери во овој комплексен свет. Во еден момент си рековме дека образованието не смее да биде скапо токму затоа што е бесценето! Поради тоа, прибегнавме кон земање заем, додека истовремено и со огромна надеж ги вложувавме нашите напори за изнаоѓање на финансиска поддршка која ќе ги покрие истите. И покрај тоа, ги исцрпевме сите можно извори, но – безуспешно. Сега, доколку не успееме да ги обезбедиме останатите 20% од школарината, ќе имаме многу тежок период во враќање на нашите позајмици.
Тоа е причината поради која бараме ваша помош. Секој цент е важен!
Ние сесрдно ве замолуваме да ни помогне да изодиме една милја поблизу до нашата цел! Ви благодарам многу за читањето и вашата поддршка.
ШТО ВИЕ ДОБИВАТЕ ЗА ВОЗВРАТ
Вашата филантропија прави огромна разлика за нас и токму затоа сакаме да ве вклучиме во нашата кампања на повеќе начини отколку само преку добивање на вашите пари. Ние составивме неколку неверојатни награди, доколку решите да се вклучите на овој начин:










ЗАБЕЛЕШКА
Сите средства кои ќе ги прибереме а кои ја надминуваат нашата цел, ќе ги донираме на Институтот за Подготовка на Глобални Лидер, така што барем еден од идногодишните учесници нема да мора да го поминува овој тежок пат. 
КОИ СМЕ НИЕ




ДРУГИ НАЧИНИ НА КОИ МОЖЕТЕ ДА НИ ПОМОГНЕТЕ
Ние сме свесни дека некои од вас, и покрај огромната желба да се вклучат во нашата кампања, не се во можност да направат финансиска контрибуција. Ние во потполност ве разбираме. За среќа, постојат и други начини кои може да ги искористите и да нѝ помогнете:



„Кренете врева“ за кампањата – раширете го муабетот;


Споделете ја нашата кампања на социјалните медиуми; и


Поканете пријатели кои би можеле да направат контрибуција.


Чудата се случуваат!
Време е . . .
Инвестицијата во образованието ги плаќа најдобрите каматни стапки. Големата цел на образованието не е стекнување знаење, туку акција. За да можеме ние да преземеме акција, ни требате вие! Направете промена! Давање е повеќе од само пари - ќе се чувствувате подобра личност за тоа!",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li><i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To alleviate the biggest complaint of goalie parents &amp; one of the biggest headaches for coaches, by eliminating  frustration and anger, replacing it with </span>understanding and empathy for coaches who are able to develop and work with their goaltenders because of the newfound knowledge provided through our Initiative. </i></li>
<li><i> To foster a proper and ongoing learning experience for young goaltenders that will result in enhanced love of the game, faster development, improved motivation and prolonged time in the game. </i></li>
<li><i>To provide all minor hockey coaches with much needed information and training so as positively change to the entire game at the minor hockey level and enhance team coaching, resulting in better goal scoring and goaltending. </i></li>
<li><i>To develop an online certification process that all minor hockey coaches can tap into, ultimately becoming certified in the Essential Core Goaltending Skills. We feel this should be a mandatory requirement to become a Head Coach.</i></li>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We know that coaches generally get involved to help their players improve their hockey and life skills, experience success and enjoy the game. <span><br/></span></span>
<p><span><br/></span>Unfortunately there is a problem within minor hockey. Many coaches don't know what they don't know in order to help their goaltenders. So they choose to either make it up, BS their way through, or simply ignore the goalies entirely. </p>
<p>Sure they may shoot pucks at them on occasion and they are part of team skills building drills, but they are really ignored in terms of Essential Core Goaltending Skills (ECGS) development. </p>
<p>This infuriates parents, demotivates goalies and causes dissension within the team. Many young goalies quit the game they love for these reasons. I've seen this over and over for as long as I've been involved with hockey - most of my life!<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>I have coached goaltenders professionally for nearly 30 years and I am passionate about helping them </span>improve. But I have now dedicated myself to helping coaches get the information they need to work with their most important player, the goalie. By focusing on the coaches and especially at the grassroots level, we will see a greater and more positive impact on the game as a whole. </p>
<p>Contributors to our campaign will be helping to positively shape the face of hockey - and thousands of goaltenders for many years to come. The trickle-UP effect will change the global landscape for goalies and their future opportunities. <span><br/></span></p>

<h3>The Global Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p><span><br/></span>Target Practice, Initiative has the potential to change the face of goaltending across the globe, but particularly in Canada and the USA, where grassroots coaches do not receive proper instruction on how to teach, motivate or instruct their goaltenders. <br/><br/>The children suffer because of this. They want to improve, they have the desire and the love of the game. Unfortunately they are often left on their own, standing around for much of the practice time or being fed inaccurate instructions and advice - then they are berated for poor play in games.  </p>
<p>This is unfair. It is completely unrealistic to expect a child to grow and progress without proper feedback and someone to help define the root cause of problems, so they can be properly worked on and improved. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The truth is that many young goalies work very hard to improve. Their parents spend a lot of money on summer camps and proper coaching for their children, yet when the season begins, so does the regression of skills and the loss of confidence. </p>
<p>The reason for this is unfortunate. We are years behind many European countries in regard to proper goalie coaching. It has taken us 20 years to recognize we have fallen so far behind, and it is the young goalies who have unfairly suffered. <span><br/></span></p>
<p><i>Target Practice</i> has the potential to change the way coaches develop goalies by implementing knowledge and the ability to define root cause problems. This will give these goaltenders the opportunity to progress and improve their overall game play through Essential Core Goaltending Skills training. This will also translate to better team play and improved scoring for players. <br/><br/>The involvement and support for the entire hockey community will facilitate this change to our game and improve the experience for all goalies. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h3>
<h3>Why 'Target Practice?'<span><br/></span>
</h3>
<p>When discussing potential names for the book and website, I decided to use a play on words - one that we felt would resonate with coaches, players, parents and goalies alike. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Many coaches and players refer to goaltenders as 'Targets.' Which when you think about it, is completely incorrect. The object of the game is NOT to hit the goalie. So this in itself shows the complete lack of understanding for the position. <span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Goalies aren't 'target's' and one of the biggest issues facing them is improper practice structure and correct coaching. Once again, a common term in hockey is to call practice, Target Practice, which IS the correct thinking if you are just teaching players how to score, but opposite of what we want for the goalies. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the end I felt 'Target Practice' was an apt title because it is in fact what a lot of practices become. As players aimlessly blast pucks at the net without any desire to build the goalies confidence or skill level. As well there are many coaches who do not having a solid grasp on the proper coaching methods, technical knowledge or root cause of many common issues goalies face. <span><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span>This all leads to goalies often feeling like they are in a shooting gallery and practices become more about survival for them than effective training and skills development time. </span></p>
<p><span>'Target Practice' is therefor the perfect name for a book and project designed to educate the very people who control these situations and have the power to change  ice time time from, 'Target Practice' to an educational experience focused on developing the Essential Core Goaltending Skills for their goalies. <span><br/></span></span></p>
<br/><h2>Other Ways You Can Help </h2>
<p>We get it, some people are simply not in a position to contribute.<span><br/></span>That doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul> <li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>Share the link for this page on your Social Media or email it those you now within the game of hockey. </li> <li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul> </div> <p>That is all there is to it, but these simple steps, that take mere seconds, will be greatly appreciated and can make a huge difference in someone's life. </p></div>","DETAILED CAMPAIGN VIDEO & PERSONAL MESSAGECLICK HERE

TARGET PRACTICE, Initiative...


OUR MISSION IS TO POSITIVELY AFFECT THE GAME OF HOCKEY AT THE GRASS ROOTS LEVEL BY PROVIDING COACHES, AND EVERYONE ELSE WITHIN THE GAME, WITH INFORMATION THAT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND, ACCESS AND USE, TO  FOSTER IMPROVED GOALTENDING INSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AT THE TEAM LEVEL.
To create and develop FREE online (website) resources and print (book) material that provides the missing and needed information hockey coaches require to better accomplish their job of helping children play better and enjoy the game more, through developing a better understanding of the goaltending position and the mental, physical and Essential Core Goaltending Skills.
To alleviate the biggest complaint of goalie parents & one of the biggest headaches for coaches, by eliminating  frustration and anger, replacing it with understanding and empathy for coaches who are able to develop and work with their goaltenders because of the newfound knowledge provided through our Initiative. 
 To foster a proper and ongoing learning experience for young goaltenders that will result in enhanced love of the game, faster development, improved motivation and prolonged time in the game. 
To provide all minor hockey coaches with much needed information and training so as positively change to the entire game at the minor hockey level and enhance team coaching, resulting in better goal scoring and goaltending. 
To develop an online certification process that all minor hockey coaches can tap into, ultimately becoming certified in the Essential Core Goaltending Skills. We feel this should be a mandatory requirement to become a Head Coach.

THIS INITIATIVE WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT COACHES AND GOALTENDERS. TEAMS WILL INCREASE SCORING WITH THE COACHES' IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF PROPERLY PACED PRACTICES, AND PLAYERS WILL BE FACING IMPROVED GOALTENDERS IN MORE REALISTIC, GAME-LIKE SITUATIONS.WE BELIEVE ALL TEAMS WILL IMPROVE IF COACHES EMPLOY THE METHODS AND TECHNIQUES PROVIDED THROUGH THE TARGET PRACTICE INITIATIVE. Every coach should:



Have a copy of this book with them at the rink at all times, and reference it when planning practices or working with their goalie

Become a member (FREE) of Target Practice Initiative website, utilizing the video's and other information to better understand proper drills and discover root causes of goalie problems
Understand that goalie development will help the entire team to score more goals and help players to develop better scoring habits and ability


We know that coaches generally get involved to help their players improve their hockey and life skills, experience success and enjoy the game. 
Unfortunately there is a problem within minor hockey. Many coaches don't know what they don't know in order to help their goaltenders. So they choose to either make it up, BS their way through, or simply ignore the goalies entirely. 
Sure they may shoot pucks at them on occasion and they are part of team skills building drills, but they are really ignored in terms of Essential Core Goaltending Skills (ECGS) development. 
This infuriates parents, demotivates goalies and causes dissension within the team. Many young goalies quit the game they love for these reasons. I've seen this over and over for as long as I've been involved with hockey - most of my life!I have coached goaltenders professionally for nearly 30 years and I am passionate about helping them improve. But I have now dedicated myself to helping coaches get the information they need to work with their most important player, the goalie. By focusing on the coaches and especially at the grassroots level, we will see a greater and more positive impact on the game as a whole. 
Contributors to our campaign will be helping to positively shape the face of hockey - and thousands of goaltenders for many years to come. The trickle-UP effect will change the global landscape for goalies and their future opportunities. 


  
What Those In The Game are Saying





Chris provides what is missing from coaching programs and this is why this book is so important. Much
of the information that is out there is too technical and unless you play the position it’s difficult to
understand, so misinformation is given to the kids by minor hockey coaches who try to tell the goalies how
they think the position should be played.                        Rick Heinz, Former NHL Goaltender 


A lot of coaches aren't that eager to work with the goalie at all. They should be
working to refine the goalies craft throughout the season.John Garrett, Former NHL Goaltender, Professional Commentator with Hockey Night In Canada 







Finally! Chris Dyson answered the questions no-one knew how to ask. After 25+ years involved in the
industry, It’s great to see this grass roots level support and guidance for the most highly criticized, under-
developed position in the game. Don Straus, Founder Armadilla Masks, World Renowned Artist 




I have never before seen information for coaches that is so useful, easily digestible, quick to read and
easy to implement. Hockey coaches and parents everywhere will be thrilled with the content of this book!Colin Hopper, President Source For Sports London, Former President Sports Distributors Canada






Providing coaches with the skills to properly work with their goaltenders is awesome and perfect. I cannot imagine a single coach not jumping at the chance to take advantage of such an opportunity, especially at the grass roots level. Larry Feist Publisher, Hockey Now Magazine 


The game has dramatically changed, but one thing that hasn’t is the core fundamentals of goaltending. Coaches at every level must be able to understand and teach these. Jim Ralph, NHL Broadcaster & Media Personality


Getting the essential core goaltending skills into the hands of grass roots coaches is perfect, it needs to happen. It is a discipline unlike any other. Mike Stubbs, Professional Broadcaster & Radio Personality







If the advice contained in Chris‘ book is made mandatory learning for minor hockey coaches, it will
positively change the face of goaltending in North America. Joni Hallikainen, Former Pro Goaltender, Professional Goaltending Consultant, Professional Mask Builder & Artist

Why 'Target Practice?'

When discussing potential names for the book and website, I decided to use a play on words - one that we felt would resonate with coaches, players, parents and goalies alike. Many coaches and players refer to goaltenders as 'Targets.' Which when you think about it, is completely incorrect. The object of the game is NOT to hit the goalie. So this in itself shows the complete lack of understanding for the position. 
Goalies aren't 'target's' and one of the biggest issues facing them is improper practice structure and correct coaching. Once again, a common term in hockey is to call practice, Target Practice, which IS the correct thinking if you are just teaching players how to score, but opposite of what we want for the goalies. In the end I felt 'Target Practice' was an apt title because it is in fact what a lot of practices become. As players aimlessly blast pucks at the net without any desire to build the goalies confidence or skill level. As well there are many coaches who do not having a solid grasp on the proper coaching methods, technical knowledge or root cause of many common issues goalies face. 
This all leads to goalies often feeling like they are in a shooting gallery and practices become more about survival for them than effective training and skills development time. 
'Target Practice' is therefor the perfect name for a book and project designed to educate the very people who control these situations and have the power to change  ice time time from, 'Target Practice' to an educational experience focused on developing the Essential Core Goaltending Skills for their goalies.

<p>We are three high school students who decided to make a difference in the world. Since the first day of class we decided that we were going to attempt to make a change in the world. Our original idea was to create a heirloom organic hydroponics system, we would use heirloom seeds (seeds that haven't been genetically modified), as well as not using pesticides and other harmful chemicals. This idea transformed into an aquaponics system which would be much more beneficial for Haitians.</p>
<p><i>Where are we from?</i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are from the Perry High School Research and Development Class. The project we chose, is a self-sufficient aquaponics system that will help the prevalent hunger problem in Haiti. We chose the project because approximately 78% of Haitians live on less than $2 US dollars a day. Many Americans spend more than $2 for a cup of coffee. Our group decided that as human beings we should help other human beings who may not be as blessed as we are.</span></p>
<p><i>What is aquaponics?</i></p>
<p>Aquaponics is using fish waste to fertilize plants. In an aquaponics system a fish is kept in a container where the water and the waste they produce is used to fertilize the plants in containers (grow beds). The major downside for our group to create this system is that in Michigan a majority of the time that we attend school it is to cold for us to have our system outside as it would be in Haiti. This unfortunately means we have to buy extra items such as a heaters and grow lights. </p>
<p><i>What progress have we made?</i></p>
<p>As of the 5th of October, 2015 we have been able to collect a few supplies to help us get started. We have collected one heater (still need 2-3 more). We have collected one grow bed, we still need at least one more to make our system fully self-sufficient. We have also found one pump to move the water from the containment system of the fish to the grow-bed, along with some PVC pipes to start the piping for the water between the container for the fish and the grow-beds. We also have gotten fish (Tilapia) which will be arriving around the end of October!</p>
<p><i>What do we still need?</i></p>
<p>We still have two major purchases to make, we need a container for the fish and grow lights. These two items are what makes up a majority of the cost, due to our current limited budget we can't afford these two things and they will have to come out of pocket if we aren't able to get the funding needed. Our fish have also shipped and will be here in late October/early November and we currently have no money to pay for them so that will also have to come out of pocket if we don't get any funding.</p>
<p><i>What happens with the Extra Funds? </i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We will use the funds for a side project if possible. Our group has solely concentrated on our aquaponics system.

We want to support young social leaders like him, and tell the world their stories. Because today's young leaders are tomorrows global leaders, and all our futures rest in their hands.
Young Leaders is a not-for-profit initiative that hopes to inspire the next generation of young social leaders. Working alongside some of Europe's leading scholars, educators and experts - Young Leaders will bring  together 100 remarkable social leaders - aged 25 and under.Based on a lengthy assessment of these leaders, the project will provide an online tool for aspiring young people to see which leaders they are similar too, and provide them with practical steps they can take to become leaders themselves.With young people increasingly pessimistic about their future, we hope Young Leaders will help the next generation to think big and start small.Proudly Supported by          We need £10,000 to help fund develop our interactive resources and ensure they reach as many motivated young people as possible. 
In addition to the development of our resources funding will help build two programmes for aspiring young people

Development of the Young Leaders School Programme: a unique one hour lesson plan for aspiring young people in their last year of school. We have teamed up with The Duke of Edinburgh International award to deliver this internationally.

Building relationships with leading organisations for the Young Leaders Work Programme: Through this programme we will help mentor and tutor aspiring young people from diverse background and help them find amazing work opportunities. 



We are working along some of Europe's leading experts, academics and educations in leadership. These incredible folks include: 

Professor Angus Laing - Dean of Business and Economics, Loughborough University; Dr Inmaculada Adarves-Yorno - Leadership Lecturer, Exeter University; Professor Lorraine Dearden - Director, Institute for Fiscal Studies; Johannes Moeller - Co-Founder, Edventure ; Kanada Elizabeth Gorla - Founder, Shine Changing Times; Professor Jean-François Manzoni - Chaired Professor, INSEAD; Ketiwe Anjorin - Manager, Sutton Trust; Professor Juan Roure Alomar - Entrepreneurship department, IESE Business School; Dr Sandra McNally - London School of Economics; Professor Vibha Gaba - INSEAD; Dr Jennifer DeWitt - King's College London; Heath Monk - CEO, Future Leaders Trust; Father Richard Peers - Headmaster, Trinity Lewisham; Roger Highfield - Executive, Science Museum Group.

</div></div>","Hello all!
My objective is to create a lifelong learning center as an adjunct to my already established teepee camp.  It will focus on telling the story of the Native Americans from their point of view and not from the point of view of the occupying Europeans.
The foundation for the presentations will be based on  National Geographic's Genographic Project.  I'll share my own results to prove to visitors that we're all related and we should treat each other with respect.

I will provide a collection of books.  I plan to buy used books when available to conserve resources.  As you can see, there is much from which to choose.


Access to high speed internet  and necessary hardware for patrons' use is another goal.  
Background:
This started as a joke. In 2013 I sold all but 5 acres of my farmland in NW Iowa.  I'm an escapee from the corporate world.  Beginning in the early 80's I wrote software for an employee benefits administration firm I co-founded in downtown Denver, Colorado.  Since 2006 I have been an artisan who makes wooden kaleidoscopes in  a shop I own in a town near the farm.  The farm has been in the family since 1885 and I sold out to my second cousin who had been renting the ground for several years.

When I discovered what people were willing to pay to sleep in a teepee, I realized it wasn't a joke after all.
I found a teepee maker and had him sew the fabric, peel the poles and erect an 18 foot teepee.  I attracted some paying customers in 2014 and discovered the best part of the place was the seclusion.  I now market it as a ""campground for introverts"".  One customer remarked, ""If you want screaming kids and barking dogs, you have to bring your own.""

You'll expedite my ongoing development of this place.
 You'll have first access to popular times at the teepee camp which will otherwise sell for much more money later. You'll be recognized at the learning center as one of those who helped early on.    Risks & Challenges 
I've made this as risk free as possible.  Even without the money, the project continues.

There is currently an after school program offered by FLICC that runs from Monday to Friday for children in the community. The ages of children attending range from those in Kindergarten to Grade 5. </p><p><strong>Why is literacy important?</strong><br/>For young students, primarily those in the Jane-Finch neighborhood, who are in a disadvantaged positions, literacy is literally, a make it or break it for their future. Having resources and systems of support in place to fill the learning gaps experienced by these children are critical in securing a solid foundation for their future. Although creating a solid foundation is important to building their confidence in a growingly competitive educational system, more important is broadening their horizons.</p><p><strong>Does Jane-Finch really live up to its stereotype?</strong><br/>The first image that may come to one's mind when they hear about the Jane-Finch community, are often negative ones. This is due to it's notorious reputation which is the result of media's spotlight of negative events in this neighborhood which maintains and reproduces all of the disempowering images and ideas held about the community. The sum of these events, create a form of tunnel vision experienced by both insiders and outsiders of the community.</p><p>The power in being able to define and give meaning to one's own self, is fundamental to creating a healthy, balanced and meaningful life. The children in the Jane-Finch community are robbed at defining themselves and their possibilities at a extremely young age. Each time labels are repeated and echoed throughout the community, the hopes and dreams of children are at risk of eroding. </p><p><b>What is our goal?</b></p><p></p><p>Our goal is to raise funds to take 30 children to Ottawa for an overnight field trip during the first week of July. The trip will be beneficial to all of the children education wise as they will be visiting Parliament Hill and the Supreme Court of Canada to learn more about Canada. Many of these children are not given opportunities to explore places outside of their neighborhood therefore we would like to give them a chance to view other parts of the province. It would be a wonderful experience for the children to visit Ottawa. </p></div>","Firgrove Learning and Innovation Community Centre (FLICC) is located in the Jane-Finch area in North York, Toronto.

The ages of children attending range from those in Kindergarten to Grade 5. Why is literacy important?For young students, primarily those in the Jane-Finch neighborhood, who are in a disadvantaged positions, literacy is literally, a make it or break it for their future. Having resources and systems of support in place to fill the learning gaps experienced by these children are critical in securing a solid foundation for their future. Although creating a solid foundation is important to building their confidence in a growingly competitive educational system, more important is broadening their horizons.Does Jane-Finch really live up to its stereotype?The first image that may come to one's mind when they hear about the Jane-Finch community, are often negative ones. This is due to it's notorious reputation which is the result of media's spotlight of negative events in this neighborhood which maintains and reproduces all of the disempowering images and ideas held about the community. The sum of these events, create a form of tunnel vision experienced by both insiders and outsiders of the community.The power in being able to define and give meaning to one's own self, is fundamental to creating a healthy, balanced and meaningful life. The children in the Jane-Finch community are robbed at defining themselves and their possibilities at a extremely young age. Each time labels are repeated and echoed throughout the community, the hopes and dreams of children are at risk of eroding. What is our goal?Our goal is to raise funds to take 30 children to Ottawa for an overnight field trip during the first week of July. The trip will be beneficial to all of the children education wise as they will be visiting Parliament Hill and the Supreme Court of Canada to learn more about Canada. Many of these children are not given opportunities to explore places outside of their neighborhood therefore we would like to give them a chance to view other parts of the province. It would be a wonderful experience for the children to visit Ottawa.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Suicide - the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. 

As a nation we have a mental health crisis. The increasing number of deaths by suicide is evidence of that and underscores the importance of our books getting published and out into the world to those who can benefit from them. 
Suicide Survivors' Club is not looking for new members. It is important for us to include the startling statistics listed below to reinforce the need for access to more resources for those at risk for suicide, and those suffering the death of a loved one by suicide.
In 2013 the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) reported that: 


someone in the U.S. died by suicide every 12.8 minutes, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death for Americans 

white males accounted for 70% of all suicides

the highest suicide rate (19.1 per 100,000 people) was among people 45 to 64 years - Don was age 52. 

men had a suicide rate of 20.2 and women had a rate of 5.5.

</h3>In the early hours of September 19th 2014, Lord Ashcroft polled more than 2000 people who had voted
 in the Scottish Independence Referendum. The results suggested that as 
voters age increased, so did their likelihood to have voted no. 71% of 
16 and 17 year olds voted Yes. This is in stark contrast to the 73% of 
over 65's who voted no. These statistics show that excluding the over 65
 age group (appx 17% of Scotlands population incidentally), the result 
of the referendum would have been a very different story, culminating in
 a victory for the Yes campaign, even after taking into consideration  
the 55 - 64 age group who voted 57/43 in favour of no.<br/> So what 
conclusions can we draw from this? Whilst it would be wholly wrong to 
apportion blame on the over 65's, the figure of 73% cannot be 
trivialised or somehow attributed to weighting or fluctuations in 
opinions and attitudes.<br/> It is worth noting at this point that 27% of
 the over 65's did have the vision,faith and belief in their people and 
their country and demonstrated the ability to open their eyes to see the
 fairer,prosperous and forward thinking country that we know Scotland 
can and will be.<br/><br/><br/><h3>What We Need to do</h3>It is with the above information that our 
initiative begins. Our aim is to reach out to that 73% and provide them 
with the information they need to allow them to reach a balanced and 
unbiased viewpoint from where they will be able to make an informed, 
educated opinion on Scotlands future, and not the heavily biased 
propoganda that is spun by the mainstream media in favour of the 
Westminster establishment.<br/> So how do we achieve this? A hugely 
considerable proportion of blame can be attributed to the over 65's lack
 of access to the internet and to lack of access to other sources that do not fall under 
Westminster control. However, deep within the darkness of the mainstream
 media, shines a bright light, a voice of reasoning which presents 
itself in the form of The Sunday Herald, and its sister publication The 
National. Our goal is to get a copy of The Sunday Herald into the hands 
of as many of our senior citizens as possible through sponsorship and 
crowd funding etc.<br/> It is with great pleasure that we bring you this 
initiative, and we truly hope that you will get involved as we all 
strive towards our common goal.<br/> Thank You.<br/><br/>

In the early hours of September 19th 2014, Lord Ashcroft polled more than 2000 people who had voted
 in the Scottish Independence Referendum. The results suggested that as 
voters age increased, so did their likelihood to have voted no. 71% of 
16 and 17 year olds voted Yes. This is in stark contrast to the 73% of 
over 65's who voted no. These statistics show that excluding the over 65
 age group (appx 17% of Scotlands population incidentally), the result 
of the referendum would have been a very different story, culminating in
 a victory for the Yes campaign, even after taking into consideration  
the 55 - 64 age group who voted 57/43 in favour of no. So what 
conclusions can we draw from this? Whilst it would be wholly wrong to 
apportion blame on the over 65's, the figure of 73% cannot be 
trivialised or somehow attributed to weighting or fluctuations in 
opinions and attitudes. It is worth noting at this point that 27% of
 the over 65's did have the vision,faith and belief in their people and 
their country and demonstrated the ability to open their eyes to see the
 fairer,prosperous and forward thinking country that we know Scotland 
can and will be.What We Need to doIt is with the above information that our 
initiative begins. Our aim is to reach out to that 73% and provide them 
with the information they need to allow them to reach a balanced and 
unbiased viewpoint from where they will be able to make an informed, 
educated opinion on Scotlands future, and not the heavily biased 
propoganda that is spun by the mainstream media in favour of the 
Westminster establishment. So how do we achieve this? A hugely 
considerable proportion of blame can be attributed to the over 65's lack
 of access to the internet and to lack of access to other sources that do not fall under 
Westminster control. However, deep within the darkness of the mainstream
 media, shines a bright light, a voice of reasoning which presents 
itself in the form of The Sunday Herald, and its sister publication The 
National. Our goal is to get a copy of The Sunday Herald into the hands 
of as many of our senior citizens as possible through sponsorship and 
crowd funding etc. It is with great pleasure that we bring you this 
initiative, and we truly hope that you will get involved as we all 
strive towards our common goal. Thank You.

My name is Christopher Alexander and I am the founder of the NW Saturday Academy. Along with my beautiful wife Jennell, I
have two children enrolled in DC Public Schools. I am a graduate of the
University of Virginia and a former captain of UVa’s Men’s Basketball team. I
currently work in the Information Technology field as a database developer and

Our team also includes parents, community members and PTA leaders Angela Christophe, Aeva Doomes, Carla Ferris and Joshua Hertzberg.

We are

One of our goals is to ensure that this type of engaging enrichment activity is available to any student, regardless of their family's ability to pay.  That is why we created Generation Tech, which will fund $350 scholarships for ten highly motivated students from families with financial need.  Your contribution could be the key to unlocking a limitless future for the next great architect, engineer or sportswear designer. We will be able to serve as many students as we can fund, so every dollar contributed will be put to good use.   What You Get In exchange for your generous sponsoring of a whole or partial scholarship, we offer several levels public acknowledgement.  If you run a business, the Goodwill you generate by associating with a media-friendly activity such as this could outweigh the benefits of a typical promotion.  Check out our perks section for more details.   The Impact The NW Saturday Academy and the Generation Tech Fund will provide students and our community with many benefits. Here are three of our main goals:

Provide extracurricular activities to Ward 4 youth that are on par with the offerings available in other parts of the city and in the suburbs. A December 29, 2014 Washington Post article examined the disparity. I responded to a reporter's inquiry:

NW Saturday Academy is a great, new option for many of our brightest students.

Encourage girls and underrepresented minority youth to consider STEM as a career. The above chart is UGLY and it, quite frankly, tells a depressing story: too many of our students are bailing out of computer science and other hard sciences before fully exploring their potential. Tech pioneers Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerburg are brilliant, but what separated them from others who were just as intelligent is that they had early access to the experience of coding.

We need to do better if we want our kids to be in position to control their future. Our program provides students with quality math instruction from a state certified teacher and extra practice with a special online learning component. The impact of this program is real, but it cannot happen without your support.  Risks & Challenges  This is a big undertaking.

Every day I work in a different school with different ways of working, and every day I meet new children. </p>
<p>I looked at various teacher planners on the market and found that they were mainly geared towards regular teachers who teach the same groups every week, they don't allow for much movement in a teachers 'timetable'. For that reason I set about designing, publishing and distributing the 'Cover Teacher's Planner' in 2014/15. This was a great success, and planners were sold to supply teachers and agencies throughout England and Wales. The planner was A4, coil bound, and included some important dates.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that supply teachers run to quite tight budgets (they don't receive holiday pay or pensions), I had to really sell the planner at a cost price, for the whole project in 2014 I made a total profit of just over £30. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What Has Been Done Differently This Year?</h3> <p>The feedback from the planner last year was fantastic, teachers really valued it and loved it's design and layout, and so the basic principles of this have been kept for the next one. However some suggestions were made and all of them have been actioned:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The planner needs to be smaller and lighter - done - the planner is now A5 size instead of A4 and so will be half the size and half the weight</li>
<li>Useful telephone numbers and websites for supply teachers - done - some research was carried out to find out what information supply teachers needed the most, and these telephone numbers and websites have been incorporated</li>
<li>Create an 'undated' planner - done - As a result of this suggestion I have been able to create an undated planner which has fewer pages and therefore costs less</li>
<li>Include 'Safeguarding' information - done - A whole page has been dedicated to Safeguarding information. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This project is not about making profit, its about getting a product out there which supply teachers can use in their every day work, as a result of that, the price of the planner has to be fairly low to enable teachers to be able to afford it. This indiegogo is a way of getting the initial investment to get the planner printed so that it can be provided to the end user at the lowest possible price. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Please feel free to buy a planner, encourage schools and agencies to buy them for their teachers. Also, please feel free to get in touch with any suggestions for next years planner. </p>

Due to the fact that supply teachers run to quite tight budgets (they don't receive holiday pay or pensions), I had to really sell the planner at a cost price, for the whole project in 2014 I made a total profit of just over £30.    What Has Been Done Differently This Year? The feedback from the planner last year was fantastic, teachers really valued it and loved it's design and layout, and so the basic principles of this have been kept for the next one. However some suggestions were made and all of them have been actioned:


The planner needs to be smaller and lighter - done - the planner is now A5 size instead of A4 and so will be half the size and half the weight
Useful telephone numbers and websites for supply teachers - done - some research was carried out to find out what information supply teachers needed the most, and these telephone numbers and websites have been incorporated
Create an 'undated' planner - done - As a result of this suggestion I have been able to create an undated planner which has fewer pages and therefore costs less
Include 'Safeguarding' information - done - A whole page has been dedicated to Safeguarding information. 


    Risks & Challenges This project is not about making profit, its about getting a product out there which supply teachers can use in their every day work, as a result of that, the price of the planner has to be fairly low to enable teachers to be able to afford it. This indiegogo is a way of getting the initial investment to get the planner printed so that it can be provided to the end user at the lowest possible price. 
    Other Ways You Can Help Please feel free to buy a planner, encourage schools and agencies to buy them for their teachers. Also, please feel free to get in touch with any suggestions for next years planner.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>It’s a fact
that more than half of First Nations children in Canada live in poverty. We’ve
all heard the stories of inadequate housing, poor nutrition, family break-down
and suicide. These are real problems that need real solutions. </p>
<p>Many Canadians
have told us they want to help, but aren’t sure how. We are launching this
crowdfunding campaign to give you the opportunity to help make a difference in
the lives of First Nation kids. The campaign is all about giving our kids a ""Passport to Fun"" this March Break.</p>
<p>Each March
break, our community has held a children’s party. Kids play games, laugh, get
silly and hang out with friends. In the past, various programs and services
have helped cover the costs of organizing the event, purchasing supplies and arranging healthy snacks. But this year, thanks to cut backs, there are
fewer dollars available. With your help, we hope to raise $2,000 to not only
throw a party like no other, but also give our kids a real thrill, by renting a
bouncy castle and slide!</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you donate more than $25, we'll send you a  'peace' bracelet, handcrafted by the children of our community!</span><br/></p>
<p>Donate more than $50, and we'll give you a free day pass to our 43rd Annual Delaware Nation Pow Wow , held in our community on Labour Day weekend., September 5 &amp; 6, 2015.</p>
<p>For those who really want to make a difference, donate $100 and we'll arrange for a special walk along our new Weelatéexung Nature Trail with one of our most experienced eco-environmental knowledge keepers!  </p>
<p>All your donations will help our kids have some fun, get out of the house, away from the tv and <i>'escape from the everyday'</i>  during March Break.<br/></p>
<p>If we are unsuccessful in reaching our $2,000 goal, all donated funds will still go towards our March Break week of activities. We just might not have enough to rent a 'bouncy castle'. :(</p>
<p>All funds will be collected by the Delaware Nation Children's Fund and given to the children's ""Passport to Fun"" March Break event.<br/></p>
<p>Our crowdfunding project is an opportunity for our different communities to make a connection; to find creative ways to make a difference in the lives of our children. Our children's bracelets, our pow wow invite and trail walk are all about connecting with people from all walks of life.  It's more than just a week of fun, and bouncy castles. It's a chance for our kids to know that there are people 'out there' who care about them, and want to do what they can to help them lead happy, productive and healthy lives. </p>
<p>Sharing is caring! We challenge you to share our crowdfunding campaign with your social networks and friends! Let them know about our attempt to raise $2,000 so that kids in one First Nation in southwestern Ontario can have some fun during March Break.

 Your contribution will help with the construction of the space, which will enhance the education of students at Westside Middle School for generations to come. The space will allow students to not only use creativity to create new things, but will teach them many skills they will need in the workforce, such as being able to communicate their ideas with peers, as well as get them interested in careers involving engineering and technology, which is of growing importance in this day and age. 
By contributing, you will allow us to purchase more supplies and technologies which will widen the number of things students will be able to create. 
You will enrich the futures of students by giving them an opportunity to explore parts of themselves they may have never been able to find in the classroom. They will be able to learn how to use machines relevant to today. They will be able to create things the world has never seen before. They will have confidence within the science, technology, engineering, and math fields that they can carry with them for life.
    Challenges
Since the room is pretty small, it will be hard to accommodate a lot of big machines. It will also be hard to fit more than 10-12 students at a time. There are approximately 948 students in our school.  Other Ways You Can Help

<p>TEDxPhiladelphia needs your help! At our last conference in June 2015, we shared tears, laughter, and a good handful of standing ovations thanks to our line-up of phenomenal and absolutely inspiring speakers. The conference theme, <i>And Justice for All</i>, sparked so much emotion and passion for change in the audience that now we want to share those exciting talks with the world! </p>
<p>So what's the rub? TEDxPhiladelphia is a volunteer-driven labor of love but passion, dedication and good intentions aren't quite enough to get some things done. As we enter the final stretch of 2015 video production and begin planning for 2016, we  need your financial help to get us there! </p>

Our 14 speakers offered perspectives that will be of value to citizens everywhere – perspectives that particularly resonant because they come from Philadelphia, the Cradle of Liberty.

TEDxPhiladelphia events, licensed by TED,  offer interactive, immersive experiences for all participants, from speakers to attendees. The annual TEDxPhiladelphia conference provides a platform for multiple points of view to interact within a common environment – building dialog amongst interested groups.


Philadelphia Daily News reporter Ronnie Polaneczky said listening is an act of justice – for those on society’s margins but also for anyone subject to another’s power.

David Norse, the first openly gay man to be ordained as a Presbyterian Pastor in Philadelphia, explored the intersection of Christian and LGBTQ identity.

A central hub for students to
interact with each other about everyday student life.
Feedit is made up of three founders:

 Ryan Cornateanu, Founder, a computer science major at UCLA. The idea behind Feedit came when was he was just a freshman.
 Vlady Cornateanu, CEO/Co-Founder, helped grow the business to what it is today. 
Ethan Mezrahi came in as an investor and later on became the Vice President of Feedit, growing its social media market to thousands of users. Our campaign to raise $100,000 will allow Feedit to grow nationally and enable to upgrade the app to its full potential in the user experience field.  The goal is to market to all 200 major universities in the country and eventually grow globally By helping us raise the necessary funds you will be helping us target the entire US student population as well as helping the students effectively communicate in their classes & forums like never done before.
   What We Need & What You Get  The goal is to raise $100,000 We are offering a variety of high-end apparel related items with our company logo.  If we do not reach the entire goal, the funds raised will still be used very efficiently towards marketing.    The Impact  Feedit is the only exclusive social network for college students. In order to sign up, a student is required to have a legitimate .edu e-mail. Each school has its own private network to meet, communicate and share with their fellow students. In only five months after launch, we had over 10,000 users log onto the app. Our  student community needs to continue growing,  therefore engaging in heavily targeted marketing.    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  As any social media app including the largest ones in the market today, the initial growth is slow and monetizing takes about one to two years. With heavy targeted marketing in the largest US colleges we hope to maximize, in a shorter period of time, the critical student mass necessary to make it attractive for companies to advertise.     Other Ways You Can Help  There are more ways to help than just money.

<p>My plan to create jobs is simple. The government issues a new type of savings bond (possibly: USA BizBonds) used exclusively to finance small businesses and create jobs. The bonds would be available in different denominations at any FDIC bank or other financial institution. Each bond would yield a reasonable rate of return which would be preset for a period of 5 - 10 years.</p>
<p>Based on the plan, the business could borrow up to $50,000 (available as a line of credit) for each new job it would create. The interest rate paid by the business would be fixed at a rate somewhat higher than that paid by the bond holders. The loan approval process would not be based on one's personal credit history and would not be dischargeable in bankruptcy. It is a total commitment to succeed on behalf of the borrower.</p>
<p><span>Savings bonds in the U.S. have had a long history, starting with Series A-D bonds, offered during the depression to give people an incentive to save safely. President Roosevelt used Series E bonds as a way of funding World War II.

Besides the billions of dollars it would cost to do this, what will happen if Mexico refused to take them? Many are not from Mexico but Instead are from South or Central America, what then? To begin with, how would we locate them? What if they refuse to go voluntarily? Do we hire thousands of new ICE agents, do we appoint hundreds of new judges, public defenders, etc?

When most people my age were planning their retirement, I returned to college and earned a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science along with a Master's in Public Administration from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (See above). In addition, I've taken numerous classes in the U.S. Constitution, Civil/Criminal Law, International Relations, including Latin American and Middle East politics.
Unfortunately today's politics are all about the money, the more you have, the better your chances of winning. Although I've never held political office, I have run before without the benefit of campaign financing. I vowed this time would be different.

There are about 20 million felons in the United States, of which more than 13 million have the right to vote. Instead of demonizing them, let's give them the opportunity to become productive members of society and thereby reduce the rate of recidivism which is currently over 67% according to the National Institute of Justice. The cost to the States is over 52 billion dollars a year, the second fastest growing budget item after Medicaid (New York Times 4/11).


The word ""felon"" or ""have you ever been convicted"" should be struck from all employment applications as it is prejudicial which often results in an automatic rejection for anyone answering ""yes"". If at all it should be replaced with: ""are you currently on probation or parole."" I believe this practice has a lot to do with the exorbitant rate of recidivism and needs to be changed.

Let's talk about forgiving student loans....

My student loan forgiveness plan makes good economical sense for both the student and the government. It assures an economically better and more educated society, which in turn makes us a stronger nation.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the average high school graduate earned $34,736 per year in 2014 while the average person with a Master's degree earned $68,952. If you multiply these numbers by a 35 years you'll find the high school graduate earned $1,215,760 and those with a Master's earned $2,413,320.
If you use the 15% tax bracket for the high school graduate and 25% bracket for those with a Master's degree, we find those with a Master's paid the government $420,999 more than those with a high school diploma.
The average cost of obtaining a Master's degree today runs about $80,000. After the government deducts the loan amount, they will receive an additional $340,999 more in taxes over a 35 year period than from the high school graduate.


There's no free lunch with my program! To qualify for the program you must complete the original degree and be employed in a related field for five years or more for forgiveness to kick in. While certain degrees and professions would carry additional incentives.
Statistics show the greater one's education, the greater their earnings and the more income tax they pay over a  lifetime. The end result is the student receives a free education, the government receives a return on its investment and society benefits.

Which means every person in this country, citizen or not, are entitled to certain civil rights including their day in court. An impossible task given there are only 58 Immigration courts in the country. Add to this our inability to find and apprehend them and house them while they wait for a court appearance. From a logistics stand point, the economic cost (multi-billions) would be staggering, if it could be done at all.

Our borders need to be strengthened, not with fences (14th Century technology) but with an increase in border patrol and technology, more importantly we need to enforce our current laws regarding their employment.
What kind of people are we who would advocate rounding up 11,000,000 or more, men women and children and dropping off at the border (which border). Has anyone ever thought this through?  Besides the billions of dollars it would cost to do this, what will happen if Mexico refused to take them? Many are not from Mexico but Instead are from South or Central America, what then? To begin with, how would we locate them? What if they refuse to go voluntarily? Do we hire thousands of new ICE agents, do we appoint hundreds of new judges, public defenders, etc? Do we build more Immigration courts and jails to accommodate them while they wait to be heard?
The only practical answer is to have them register, pay a fine, and begin a path towards citizenship. It is far better to have them become a productive members of society, pay taxes and know who they are rather than to ignore them. Let's face it, they are not going back, so let's fix the problem NOW!
 

 
Let's talk about legalizing drugs..........

The only way to eliminate illegal drugs is to take the money out, legalize, tax and regulate them. Stricter penalties drive the price up and add to the number who want to sell them. Let's begin slowly with marijuana. Many states have legalized it in one form or another, however it remains illegal under federal law. It's time to change that NOW!

 

 
Let's talk about eliminating nuclear weapons........

Having grown up during the Cold War there were many days that I 
thought a nuclear war was eminent either by accident or on purpose.
Since we are a civilized society 
and have no intentions of ever using a nuclear weapon, it's time we 
began negotiating the elimination of all these weapons. I believe, no 
one, including the United States should have the capability of 
eliminating the entire human race with the push of a button. 
It appears from the above graph we are continuing to reduce the number of warheads. It's time to pursue the elimination of all nuclear warheads from all nations. As the country with the greatest number of warheads, lets take the lead?
 

 

By now, I hope you've decided to support my bid to be your next Congressman. For more information please go to my website.
 

 
Coming Soon...

<p></p>FACES is a committed Community of Volunteers unlocking the potential of the people of Oregon educating through training and support, low-income families, migrant families, and different minority groups, by connecting the community resources with the community needs. <br/><br/>FACES supports School Districts and organizations in establishing adult literacy programs called “Plazas Comunitarias”. FACES trains parents in early childhood literacy and supports and provides resources for students and community members pursuing a college education.  <br/><br/>FACES is committed to distribute books and literacy resources, provided by the Mexican Department of Education, among our Spanish speaking families. <br/><p><span></span></p>
<p><b>FACES is now expanding to offer Bilingual English-Spanish Day Care and Preschool Program, with an advanced Literacy Program, at our new location in 1687 Summer St. NE Salem  OR  97301</b></p>
<p><b>
During the first few years
of life, children’s brains develop at a rapid pace, influenced by the
experiences they have at home, in their early care and education settings, and
in their communities. Their experiences include the quantity and quality of
words they are exposed to through talking, reading, and singing. Research has
found that providing infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with rich early
language experiences can have important benefits on their brain development and
school readiness. <br/></b></p>
<p><b><i>“</i><i>We know that right now during the first three years of
life, a child born into a low-income family hears 30 million fewer words than a
child born into a well-off family. By giving more of our kids access to
high-quality pre-school and other early learning programs, and by helping
parents get the tools they need to help their kids succeed, we can give those
kids a better shot at the career they are capable of, and a life that will make
us all better off.”</i></b>
</p>
<p><b><i>-President Obama</i></b></p>
<i><b><em>“The economic benefits of investing in high-quality
early childhood education are clear and backed by an impressive amount of
research, as laid out in Tim Bartik’s book. With businesses concerned about
securing a future skilled workforce, with our military leaders concerned about

the troubling increase in income inequality, we should be looking at proven
investments in children and youth that strengthen our human capital and the
future of our economy.”</em>—Arthur J. Rolnick <br/><br/></b></i><p><b>This is very important for FACES, because there are more than 27,000 children 0-5 in Marion county. Only 15 out of 100 are being served with Early Childhood Education. 28.3% of these children live in poverty, compared to the 23% in all Oregon. There are 12,200 families receiving childcare subsidies and 16,893 participants in all Head Start Programs, but what about the rest?</b></p>
<p><b>We are expanding to offer Bilingual Day Care and Preschool with a very advanced Literacy Program and with your donation, you are helping FACES  <b>prepare a scholarship fund to offer scholarships to very low income families. </b> These families either do not qualified for head start programs, or cannot pay for day care, due to their very low salaries. These are the families with very limited education and whose children are entering schools with no academic and social skills and with very limited vocabulary due to the lack of interaction with their parents. </b></p>
<p><b><b>FACES will continue training parents to meet their children's academic needs and offering K-12 students with extracurricular programs and math and literacy after school tutoring.</b></b></p>
<p><b>We cannot accomplish this task without your help, your contribution is very important! You can donate as little as $5, $10, $20 or more.</b></p>
<br/><ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Help FACES provide scholarships for low-income students, each preschooler needs approximately $ 6000 a year for a full time, 5 days a week high quality bilingual preschool, breakfast and lunch, nurse services, motor skills specialist, a 
nutritionist  
on site and much more.</p>
<p>It is difficult to describe the emotions we teachers, teaching little ones, experience when we look at a learning face, a discovering face, those ahaa! moments when a concept is learned and the child feels at the top of the world. We teach our students to feel successful at an early age, students who believe in themselves and feel successful, will not learn differently and are set to a great start. <br/></p>
<p>The methods used, treat the child as a whole, covering all the child's needs, involving the whole family in his/her education. We have used this method in preschoolers and kindergartners during the past 9 years, the results are amazing, we have produced 
 advanced readers, writers and math experts. We have track a big group of students whose parents are connected to FACES still, and they report very high achieving students that are now about to finish middle school. We have records in pictures and videos and you are invited to watch them upon request. Amazing videos of 4 and 5 year olds reading and writing as first and second grade students.<br/></p>
<p>                                   <b> WE NEED YOU IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS!!!</b><br/></p>
<p>We are trying to fund, at least 17 full time students a year and we know that with your help, we will accomplish this task. If we were not to reach the entire goal, we will fund the number of students covered by the obtained amount.<br/></p>
<br/><br/><h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>We know, according to the census, that we cannot cover all the 85 students out of 100 that are not receiving any Early Childhood Education services, but we can help serving at least 180 families and with your help offer at least  17 families the funds to pay for their tuition.<br/>Preparing our children at an early age will make sure that our generations to come, will be educated individuals who will contribute for a better America.

</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Reaching our goal is not easy, we need education, experience, skills, patience, consistency and HEART to accomplish this and we are proud to say that we have it. Most of our staff are individuals who were first volunteers at FACES, while working full time at their own jobs. With years of experience, degrees and all the necessary education to perform their duties, but using their free time to volunteer at FACES.</p>
<p>During the past nine years, FACES has offered its services free of charge to our community. All of its members worked hard writing grants, organizing fundraising events and paying from their own pockets, for materials, for rent and to pay their own gas for transportation to events and errands. Our Director has more than 36 years in education, between Mexico and USA, from preschool to college and holds the equivalent to a BA in Mexico and a BA in the USA and two Master Degrees in Education and School Leadership and Administration. The rest of the staff hold degrees in their own specialties.<br/></p>
<p>They volunteered their time for tutoring in after school programs, teaching adults and training parents to advocate for their children in school with an educational focus. We offered parallel education for the parents to stay abreast or shoulder to  shoulder with their children. Resulting in reducing illiteracy level for families, <br/>increased the parents’ reading skills so they can help their children, and<br/>increased the level of reading capacity toward closing the gap.</p>
<p>Another of the challenges are the funds to keep our high quality programs; funds that will be coming from monthly tuition, partnerships, sponsors, grants and fundraisers. <span>We need to work hard to keep the revenues that will cover the monthly expenses of the program, coming in.</span><br/><br/><b>                             WE NEED YOU IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS!!!</b><br/><br/></p>

Send me to shoemaking school! You can help by purchasing some of my handmade leather crafts. Act now!

Your contribution will help in prolonging an American Institution that is in much need of revitalization - traditional trade and craftsmanship. The USA is in a great shortage of fine craftsmen. Traditional shoemaking has become an honest rarity. We need more craftsmen and makers to practice and share this knowledge so the world can appreciate the difference between fine quality and bargain throw away stuff. Help me learn shoemaking.

</ul><br/><h3>How did I get to where I am now?</h3><p>At a very young age I was attracted to two things: 1) Figuring out how the world around me worked, and 2) after figuring out how it worked, then how can it be built? Then of course try to build it and refine. #myzen</p><br/><p>Fast forward 30 sum years. After working at a deskjob for most of my career and losing my craft zen, I started playing around with leather in 2012. Not surprisingly, I found that I really enjoyed it. I started making some small leather goods and gradually got into making some bigger stuff, like bags, backpacks and ladies clutches. Check out many of the things I've made at my tumblr page - <a href=""http://mackandcrow.tumblr.com/tagged/needle%20and%20thread"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MackerelCrow Blog</a>. Everything so far has been self taught or learned from a few really great books. In 2014-ish, I decided to start a side project, <a href=""http://www.mackerelcrow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MackerelCrow</a>, designing and making urban backpacks and accessories. I make the products myself or through a factory domestically in, Seattle, Washington and people love them. </p><br/><h3>Why am I doing this campaign?</h3><p>For me the next frontier in leather work is shoemaking. It’s a fascinating process that has evolved over thousands of years.  With so many steps and nuances, it’s something that's virtually impossible to perfect on your own without decades of experience. Shoes are fascinating to me. They're somewhat enigmatic too - a cheap pair can cost as little as $20 and last a couple months. While a fine pair of shoes can cost upwards of $500, but last the user a decade or more with proper maintenance and mending. It’s a beautiful thing when an object can be crafted to such a degree of quality that the user would want to treasure it, and to be willing to spend so much and keep the product so long. How many things are like that today? </p><br/><p>My desire has always been to create products that bring great satisfaction to the user. I want to make things that people cherish and pass down to their children. Going to shoe school will help me up my game. </p><br/><p>Lastly, as a contributor to my campaign, you will help an American craftsman move to the next level in his maker’s journey. Contribute to my campaign and purchase some of the things that I make, the proceeds will allow me to study shoe making from professional shoemakers in Washington State on the Olympic Peninsula.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Where is all that money going?</h3><ul>

<li><p>If I don’t make my goal you will still get your perks, the thing about this campaign is that I’m not doing anything I don’t normally do already - i.e. make things for people. All the products are things I make on a regular basis already. So, if the campaign doesn't reach the goal your money will still go to my shoemaking school fund, I will just have to find the rest of the money elsewhere.

<li><p>The biggest risk is for me is to produce as much as this campaign demands in a short amount of time.

<li><p>Probably the best way to address production delays is to bring in some of my talented craft partners who’ve helped me make my products in the past.

<p>Zelfbewustzwanger.nl is een organisatie die een beweging inzet: versterken van de stem van de zwangere en hun partners.</p>
<p><b>Hoe?</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Door een dynamisch online programma te ontwikkelen met informatieve video’s, handvatten, oefeningen over datgene waarvan de zwangeren zèlf hebben aangegeven dat er behoefte aan is</li>
<li>Door het opzetten van een platform van waaruit de stem van de zwangeren en hun partners ingebracht/gehoord kan worden (bij beleidsmakers).  <br/><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433423699/wol6cc7j3kdnoh1rukdq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Als een zwangere:

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>weet wat er te kiezen is,</li>
<li>de keuzes maakt die voor haar (gezondheid en welzijn) goed zijn,</li>
<li>een gevoel van regie ervaart tijdens haar bevalling,</li>
</ul>
<p>vergroot dat haar kansen op een
optimale bevalling, of dat nou thuis is, in een geboortehuis of in een
ziekenhuis. </p>
<p>Wil JIJ meedoen om ervoor te zorgen dat
de geboortezorg verbetert? Betere zorg, minder kosten, maar vooral meer
gelukkige zelfverzekerde en gezonde moeders en betrokken partners die ervoor
zorgen dat hun baby’s vanuit vertrouwen kunnen beginnen aan hun
levensreis! </p>
<p>Doneer dan en kies een van deze leuke beloningen als dank voor jouw
steun!</p>
<p>Dan gaan wij aan de slag de video's te maken.  Hiermee geven
we zwangere vrouwen en hun partners 20 weken lang zicht op welke keuzes ze
kunnen maken. We helpen week na week verder te bouwen aan een krachtig
zelfvertrouwen! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Waarom is jouw hulp nodig?</h3>
<p>Door het GRATIS
aan te bieden en te ontwikkelen in samenwerking met professionals, creëren we
aansprekende en betrouwbare inhoud voor de video’s. Hierdoor kunnen veel
zwangere vrouwen die behoefte hebben aan dit programma bereiken.</p>
<p>Jouw bijdrage maakt het mogelijk om: </p>
<ul>
<li>De
     productiekosten van de video’s te kunnen betalen. </li>
<li>Een online
     Academy te kunnen bouwen waar het online programma straks op aangeboden
     kan worden. </li>
<li>Ervoor te zorgen
     dat de zwangeren weten dat dit programma er voor ze is en het gaan
     gebruiken. </li>
<li>Te starten met
     het creëren van een platform van waaruit de stem van de zwangeren en hun
     partners ingebracht/gehoord kan worden.</li>
</ul>
<div>Ons crowdfunding doel hebben we gesteld op 25.000 euro. Dat dekt de kosten en maakt t mogelijk om door te gaan met het bouwen aan een community.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Jouw beloning:</h3>Voor 100 euro
ben je erbij op 12 juli! Een onvergetelijke middag met leuke workshops. Laat je
lekker masseren of verken wat Rebozo voor jou kan betekenen. Geniet van
schitterende hartverwarmende muziek!

<p>Voor 750 euro
adopteer je jouw eigen video! Bij de aftiteling van de video laten we jouw naam
in beeld zien! Zodat iedereen weet dat jij het financieel mogelijk hebt gemaakt
die video te maken zodat de zwangere er GRATIS naar kan kijken. Wat een kans!</p>
<p>Of kies een van de andere leuke beloningen. Voor 15 euro zetten we jouw voornaam bij ons op de website voor een warm dankjewel voor jouw steun.</p>
<p>Kies jij graag voor een bepaalde beloning, maar wil je graag meer doneren? Dat kan! Je kan zelf bepalen hoeveel geld je doneert!</p>
<p>Ook als je wel wilt geven, maar daar geen beloning voor terug wilt, kun je geven. </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Grote impact</h3>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Er is een groeiende angst onder zwangere vrouwen. Uit ons onderzoek blijkt dat jonge zwangere vrouwen significant vaker angstiger zijn over het verloop van hun zwangerschap en dat ze zich zorgen maken over het verliezen van de regie tijdens de bevalling.</p>
<p>En dat terwijl ze juist zo graag gezond, gelukkig en ontspannen willen beginnen aan het moederschap!</p>
<p>Zwangere vrouwen geven aan dat het lastig is om in beeld te krijgen van wat er allemaal te kiezen is. </p>
<p>En het vraagt nogal wat om voor je keuzes te gaan staan. Mede hierdoor gaat het niet altijd zoals gewenst en ontstaat er achteraf teleurstelling.</p>
<p>Dat is zó jammer! En onnodig. Want het kan écht anders.</p>
<p>Daarom is dit initiatief zelfbewustzwanger gestart.  Samen van angst naar vertrouwen.</p>
<p>Door bij de basis te beginnen.</p>
<p>Door zwangere vrouwen te bekrachtigen. Zodat elke vrouw die beslissingen kan maken, die het beste zijn voor haarzelf en haar kind, gesteund door haar partner. Zodat de kersverse ouders straks terugkijken vanuit gevoel van geluk en trots, tevreden met de keuzes die zijn gemaakt. En hun baby’s vanuit vertrouwen kunnen beginnen aan hun levensreis! </p>
<p><b>Zou dat niet gaaf zijn....? Met jouw steun wordt dat mogelijk!</b></p>
<p>Maar er is nog meer...! Jouw hulp creëert nog meer impact.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Op papier staat de zwangere centraal. Hoe ziet de praktijk eruit?</h3>

Maar zwangeren zijn wel gebruikers van een belangrijk deel van deze zorgdienstverlening.</p>
<p><b>Wat blijkt?</b></p>
<p>Als er een sterke vertegenwoordiging is van de gebruikers van de zorg, ontstaat vernieuwing en verbetering van beleid. Het longfonds en de brandwondenstichting zijn hier succesvolle voorbeelden van.</p>
<p>Dit is ook belangrijk voor de geboortezorg! Juist nu Nederland de geboortezorg anders wil gaan inrichten met één budget voor zowel gynaecologen als de verloskundigen. De stoel van de zwangere aan deze tafel van beleidsmakers in de geboortezorg mag niet leeg blijven!</p>
<p>Door het opzetten van dit platform zelfbewustzwanger zorgen we ervoor dat de stem van de zwangeren en hun partners ingebracht en gehoord kan worden bij beleidsmakers.</p>

<p>Floor Molkenboer in de eerste plaats moeder! Ik heb bedrijfskunde gestudeerd. Ik ben professioneel coach vrouwelijk leiderschap &amp;
leiderschapsontwikkeling èn initiatiefneemster van zelfbewustzwanger.nl . Op
verschillende manieren  ben ik betrokken geraakt bij de geboortezorg: als ‘gebruiker’,
als trainer/coach voor zorgprofessionals en als adviseur voor zorgorganisaties.
Mijn droom is om in de geboortezorg de kracht van vertrouwen te versterken.</p>
<p>Zwanger zijn is
bij uitstek een periode in je leven waar het gaat om het inzetten van vrouwelijk leiderschap! Ik deel graag mijn expertise als coach vrouwelijk leiderschap om zwangere vrouwen te ondersteunen bij het bouwen aan een krachtig zelfvertrouwen.</p>
<p>Ik werk samen met een fantastisch team. Daarnaast zijn inhoudelijk ook betrokken bij het materiaal en de positionering van dit initiatief mijn adviseurs: Elske Feitsma (moeder, zwanger, yogadocent) Jeroen van Dillen (vader, gynaecoloog), Angela Verbeeten (moeder, verloskundige JUNO), Maike Gregoor (moeder, directeur Kraamzorg Liemerscare), Kim Boersma (moeder, adviseur conceptontwikkeling en positionering).</p>

<h3>Ons plan van aanpak?</h3>
<p>Welke stappen
gaan we zetten?</p>
<p>Afgelopen 3
maanden hebben ruim 600 zwangeren en reeds bevallen vrouwen en hun partners
aangegeven waar het online programma wat hun betreft over moet gaan. Er staat
een team van professionals klaar om circa 20 video’s te gaan ontwikkelen en
opnemen.</p>
<p>Projectplanning:</p>
<p><b>12 JUNI:</b>
lancering crowdfunding</p>
<p><b>15 JUNI-6 JULI:</b>
ontwikkelen en opnemen van de video’s. Bouwen van de online Academy waar het
programma straks gaat draaien.</p>
<p><b><u>12 JULI:</u></b> Een feest ter ere van alle zelfbewuste
zwangeren en hun partners. Het moment waarop het online programma gelanceerd
wordt!</p>

Currently, the voice of pregnant women is not heard properly by policy makers and other stakeholders deciding on the organization of birth care in the Netherlands. This is something we passionately want to change. Zelfbewustzwanger.nl is set up to make the difference.
The videos will be available for FREE for pregnant women,  so that as many women as possible have access to the program. In order to finance this project, we need your support. Therefore, we start this crowd funding campaign. If you want to join this campaign, if you want to help us out, please select a perk! For 15 euro's your first name will be displayed on our website. Your donation will be used to help us create the awareness of our offer to pregnant women. Thank you for making a change!!
For 750 euro you are a change maker! Choose your own video and your name will be showed at the end of the video, so that everyone knows you are a change maker!

Korte samenvatting 





Zelfbewustzwanger.nl is een organisatie die een beweging inzet: versterken van de stem van de zwangere en hun partners.
Hoe?

Door een dynamisch online programma te ontwikkelen met informatieve video’s, handvatten, oefeningen over datgene waarvan de zwangeren zèlf hebben aangegeven dat er behoefte aan is
Door het opzetten van een platform van waaruit de stem van de zwangeren en hun partners ingebracht/gehoord kan worden (bij beleidsmakers).  




Als een zwangere:



weet wat er te kiezen is,
de keuzes maakt die voor haar (gezondheid en welzijn) goed zijn,
een gevoel van regie ervaart tijdens haar bevalling,

vergroot dat haar kansen op een
optimale bevalling, of dat nou thuis is, in een geboortehuis of in een
ziekenhuis. 
Wil JIJ meedoen om ervoor te zorgen dat
de geboortezorg verbetert? Betere zorg, minder kosten, maar vooral meer
gelukkige zelfverzekerde en gezonde moeders en betrokken partners die ervoor
zorgen dat hun baby’s vanuit vertrouwen kunnen beginnen aan hun
levensreis! 
Doneer dan en kies een van deze leuke beloningen als dank voor jouw
steun!
Dan gaan wij aan de slag de video's te maken.  Hiermee geven
we zwangere vrouwen en hun partners 20 weken lang zicht op welke keuzes ze
kunnen maken. We helpen week na week verder te bouwen aan een krachtig
zelfvertrouwen! 



Waarom is jouw hulp nodig?
Door het GRATIS
aan te bieden en te ontwikkelen in samenwerking met professionals, creëren we
aansprekende en betrouwbare inhoud voor de video’s. Hierdoor kunnen veel
zwangere vrouwen die behoefte hebben aan dit programma bereiken.
Jouw bijdrage maakt het mogelijk om: 

De
     productiekosten van de video’s te kunnen betalen. 
Een online
     Academy te kunnen bouwen waar het online programma straks op aangeboden
     kan worden. 
Ervoor te zorgen
     dat de zwangeren weten dat dit programma er voor ze is en het gaan
     gebruiken. 
Te starten met
     het creëren van een platform van waaruit de stem van de zwangeren en hun
     partners ingebracht/gehoord kan worden.

Ons crowdfunding doel hebben we gesteld op 25.000 euro. Dat dekt de kosten en maakt t mogelijk om door te gaan met het bouwen aan een community.




Jouw beloning:Voor 100 euro
ben je erbij op 12 juli! Een onvergetelijke middag met leuke workshops. Laat je
lekker masseren of verken wat Rebozo voor jou kan betekenen. Geniet van
schitterende hartverwarmende muziek!

Voor 750 euro
adopteer je jouw eigen video! Bij de aftiteling van de video laten we jouw naam
in beeld zien! Zodat iedereen weet dat jij het financieel mogelijk hebt gemaakt
die video te maken zodat de zwangere er GRATIS naar kan kijken. Wat een kans!
Of kies een van de andere leuke beloningen. Voor 15 euro zetten we jouw voornaam bij ons op de website voor een warm dankjewel voor jouw steun.
Kies jij graag voor een bepaalde beloning, maar wil je graag meer doneren? Dat kan! Je kan zelf bepalen hoeveel geld je doneert!
Ook als je wel wilt geven, maar daar geen beloning voor terug wilt, kun je geven. 
 

Grote impact


Er is een groeiende angst onder zwangere vrouwen. Uit ons onderzoek blijkt dat jonge zwangere vrouwen significant vaker angstiger zijn over het verloop van hun zwangerschap en dat ze zich zorgen maken over het verliezen van de regie tijdens de bevalling.
En dat terwijl ze juist zo graag gezond, gelukkig en ontspannen willen beginnen aan het moederschap!
Zwangere vrouwen geven aan dat het lastig is om in beeld te krijgen van wat er allemaal te kiezen is. 
En het vraagt nogal wat om voor je keuzes te gaan staan. Mede hierdoor gaat het niet altijd zoals gewenst en ontstaat er achteraf teleurstelling.
Dat is zó jammer! En onnodig. Want het kan écht anders.
Daarom is dit initiatief zelfbewustzwanger gestart.  Samen van angst naar vertrouwen.
Door bij de basis te beginnen.
Door zwangere vrouwen te bekrachtigen. Zodat elke vrouw die beslissingen kan maken, die het beste zijn voor haarzelf en haar kind, gesteund door haar partner. Zodat de kersverse ouders straks terugkijken vanuit gevoel van geluk en trots, tevreden met de keuzes die zijn gemaakt. En hun baby’s vanuit vertrouwen kunnen beginnen aan hun levensreis! 
Zou dat niet gaaf zijn....? Met jouw steun wordt dat mogelijk!
Maar er is nog meer...! Jouw hulp creëert nog meer impact.

Op papier staat de zwangere centraal. Hoe ziet de praktijk eruit?

De stem van de zwangere is landelijk onvoldoende vertegenwoordigd in de discussies rond goede geboortezorg.Zwangerschap is geen ziekte. Maar zwangeren zijn wel gebruikers van een belangrijk deel van deze zorgdienstverlening.
Wat blijkt?
Als er een sterke vertegenwoordiging is van de gebruikers van de zorg, ontstaat vernieuwing en verbetering van beleid. Het longfonds en de brandwondenstichting zijn hier succesvolle voorbeelden van.
Dit is ook belangrijk voor de geboortezorg! Juist nu Nederland de geboortezorg anders wil gaan inrichten met één budget voor zowel gynaecologen als de verloskundigen. De stoel van de zwangere aan deze tafel van beleidsmakers in de geboortezorg mag niet leeg blijven!
Door het opzetten van dit platform zelfbewustzwanger zorgen we ervoor dat de stem van de zwangeren en hun partners ingebracht en gehoord kan worden bij beleidsmakers.



Wie zit er achter zelfbewustzwanger?




Floor Molkenboer in de eerste plaats moeder! Ik heb bedrijfskunde gestudeerd. Ik ben professioneel coach vrouwelijk leiderschap &
leiderschapsontwikkeling èn initiatiefneemster van zelfbewustzwanger.nl . Op
verschillende manieren  ben ik betrokken geraakt bij de geboortezorg: als ‘gebruiker’,
als trainer/coach voor zorgprofessionals en als adviseur voor zorgorganisaties.
Mijn droom is om in de geboortezorg de kracht van vertrouwen te versterken.
Zwanger zijn is
bij uitstek een periode in je leven waar het gaat om het inzetten van vrouwelijk leiderschap! Ik deel graag mijn expertise als coach vrouwelijk leiderschap om zwangere vrouwen te ondersteunen bij het bouwen aan een krachtig zelfvertrouwen.
Ik werk samen met een fantastisch team. Daarnaast zijn inhoudelijk ook betrokken bij het materiaal en de positionering van dit initiatief mijn adviseurs: Elske Feitsma (moeder, zwanger, yogadocent) Jeroen van Dillen (vader, gynaecoloog), Angela Verbeeten (moeder, verloskundige JUNO), Maike Gregoor (moeder, directeur Kraamzorg Liemerscare), Kim Boersma (moeder, adviseur conceptontwikkeling en positionering).


Ons plan van aanpak?
Welke stappen
gaan we zetten?
Afgelopen 3
maanden hebben ruim 600 zwangeren en reeds bevallen vrouwen en hun partners
aangegeven waar het online programma wat hun betreft over moet gaan. Er staat
een team van professionals klaar om circa 20 video’s te gaan ontwikkelen en
opnemen.
Projectplanning:
12 JUNI:
lancering crowdfunding
15 JUNI-6 JULI:
ontwikkelen en opnemen van de video’s. Bouwen van de online Academy waar het
programma straks gaat draaien.
12 JULI: Een feest ter ere van alle zelfbewuste
zwangeren en hun partners. Het moment waarop het online programma gelanceerd
wordt!

Waarom verdient zelfbewustzwanger jouw steun? Deze mensen geven antwoord:




Sabrina Reinders, nu 8 maanden zwanger! ""Ik steun dit initiatief om een aantal redenen: Elke zwangerschap is anders. Elke zwangerschap is ook weer spannend. Ik vind het belangrijk dat vrouwen bewust zwanger kunnen zijn en ook vol zelfvertrouwen. Dat gaat dit programma bieden. Door vrouwen elke week, elke dag bij te helpen.""

Jeroen van Dillen, gynaecoloog en vader van 4 kinderen: “Ik ondersteun dit initiatief om twee redenen: Ten eerste helpt het jonge ouders om bewust vorm te geven aan hun eigen zwangerschap en bevalling. Ten tweede helpt het ons zorgverleners aan de stem van de jonge ouders”.

Angela Verbeeten: “Als verloskundige streef ik ernaar dat moeders en vaders goed terug kunnen kijken naar de geboorte van hun kind. Daarom steun ik dit initiatief, want dit gaat ouders daarbij helpen!”

Maike Gregoor, kraamzorg LiemersCare: “Ik ondersteun dit initiatief omdat ik het belangrijk vind dat zwangeren weten dat ze een keuze mogen maken.  En hierdoor met meer vertrouwen het ouderschap ingaan.”



Ook Jessica Mendel, Actrice en tv-presentatrice, bekend bij het
Nederlandse publiek doordat ze het programma CampingLife een aantal jaar
presenteerde, zet zich in voor zelfbewustzwanger!



""Ik ben Jessica
Mendels.  Momenteel zwanger van ons tweede kindje. Ik weet sinds kort dat
ik diabetes heb. En daarom is het nog belangrijker dat ik goed op mijn
gezondheid en rust let, om ook dit kindje gezond en wel op de wereld te zetten.
Om mij heen hoor ik vaak dat andere zwangere vrouwen worstelen bij het maken
van keuzes. Er zijn heel veel keuzes te maken. Daarom vind ik
zelfbeustzwanger.nl zo’n goed initiatief! Zij helpen juist de vrouwen bij het
maken van de juiste keuzes voor henzelf. Steun ook zelfbewustzwanger en doneer.
Kies een van de beloningen hier op de website. Als
mijn zwangerschap het toelaat zien we elkaar 12 juli bij het feest waar we
vieren dat we allemaal zelfbewustzwanger zijn en waar ook de partners welkom
zijn!""",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>","What's EOS-Book?


EOS-Book is a digital monthly and independent magazine (available in PDF, ePub and mobi) about Electronics and Technology, it is based on a 
current project: an Italian blog called Elettronica Open Source.
Since 2012, it has become a
point of reference magazine in Italy for Engineers, Technology addicts/lovers, makers, etc, focusing  on technical articles about electronics, technology and other subjects, such as mathematics, physics and astrophysics to satisfy our
readers' every need.


Readers
can find all the main topics together with other important subjects
such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Embedded board, Programming, Robotics, Science, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, IoT, Wearable, PCB, Android, Linux, DIY. It
has also a section dedicated to 3D Printer. How to choose a 3D Printer, is
an example of one of the most popular articles in 2014 for our
Italian users.





In
the following picture you will see the Italian version cover of  June
2015 EOS-Book issue. With your support, we would like to translate this
issue into English.






Our
technical projects include different electronic fields such as FTPmicro temperature monitor, how to send data to Google Doc Spreadsheets with Picmicro



Moreover, in
the following picture you will find an example of basic Electronics. You
can see the schematic of a simple and Open Source project about a
self-learning electronic resistive key:





In

</p><p>Dear friends, supporters and donors,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lavinia Marin and at the end of June, this year, I let myself out of
the media as a journalist, in order to engage myself in teaching Yoga for
Children. I consider this work the best way to take care of my community and
the well-being of the future generations. It was a big step for me. First of
all, I chose a different lifestyle: to be healthy, balanced and happy by doing
what I like, what I love, and being able to help others, in the same time.</p>
<p>During last years, in order to find balance in the
challanging environment of media, I was practicing daily meditation and Hatha
Yoga. That literally kept me alive and helped me succesfully manage my advanced
fatigue, insomnia and frequent migraines. By gaining back my health and being able to
blossom again after almost 5 hard years, now I'm more than happy to share this
knowledge and practice with children and adults in search for a healthy body
and mind. The new strength I found inside me gave me the
courage to open myself to a new path in managing my life and my well-being. </p>

<p>Last year, in October, with the
support of a dear friend of mine, I succesfully followed a <a href=""http://jogamoka.hu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">teacher training program in Yoga for Children</a>. This
new perspective made me give up my struggle to keep working in a stressful and unhealthy environment . This is the reason why I sincerely feel that I should give my whole energy, time and soul to becoming a
good teacher and increase awareness for a healthy way of living, starting with
the well-being  of the little ones. Finally, that’s my way to honour the discipline that truly saved my life. <span></span></p><p>Step by step, I began to discover more and more about taking care of myself and those around me.

<p>In order to make this huge shift
for me, to give space and time to this new way of practice in my life, I need
your financial support. Not for long, but just to pass through this transition
period of time and then gaining my financial support happily doing my work with children. For
now, I need more money to buy all kind of playing tools and musical instruments (which I use in
the various games during one hour of practice), for books, sometimes for yoga
mats, and also to participate in workshops for therapy with children or
seminars.</p>
<p>Now I'm teaching Yoga for Children as
a volunteer in an open library, which has many wonderful programs for children.
Next month, I will also have the opportunity to teach in a new library, as a
volunteer. And although the perspective of being payed for this wonderful job
is still faraway, I'm willing to do this because is far more important for the children
to have free acces to this amazing and beneficial discipline.</p>This is the reason I kindly ask you to stand by me and be part of this
beautiful and useful discipline for children. Your support will help me to keep
this education alive, to continue my progress in this journey and to sustain my

in workshops and seminars, be able to provide good teaching in Yoga for
Children.<br/><p>

Why does this matter? Because...


600 million people rely directly on reefs for their survival 

Reefs are the nurseries of the sea 

Tourism, the largest global industry, relies heavily on reefs
Reefs protect coastlines and cities from storms and tsunamis
The most effective drug for childhood leukemia was derived from a Caribbean sponge, and many more miracle drugs are currently in development
The marine economy in California contributes around $40 billion to the State each year.

Education:
Both internationally and in our home state of California, we educate students - from elementary school through university - about the marine environment. In 2012, Reef Check's episode of PBS' ""SciGirls"" won a Daytime Emmy Award.

Currently, 50% of school children in Los Angeles have never put a toe in the ocean, even though it's our city's ""backyard."" How can we expect future generations to preserve something that they know nothing about?

<p><a href=""http://internetschoolofmagic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Internet School of Magic</a> is my dream to spend my life helping people as a teacher, healer, and activist. For me, this means providing spiritual guidance, training in specific and advanced skills of occult practice, critical thinking, and philosophy, and performing shamanic healings. Moreover, I am a critical activist, which means I want to help the world by winning key struggles to protect the planet and its people from exploitation and abuse. The School is my platform for teaching and healing as well as a hub for critical activism, networking, and activist education. Much more about the School and my other projects and forthcoming books can be found at the website, linked above.</p>
<p>I am a psychologist, scientist, programmer, and writer studying Sapience and Initiation. Sapience is the ineffable quality that makes us human, and initiation is the process of welcoming people into the human condition and to sapience. I have studied both of these phenomena for ten years as I acquired first a Psychology degree at University of Washington and then a master's in Educational Technology &amp; Educational Psychology at Michigan State University. I studied critical pedagogy and pedagogical ethics during my time at MSU, at the PhD level. My passion is to heal the world, one illuminated mind and strengthened will at a time.<br/></p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds from this indiegogo campaign will be used to travel to the X-Day and Starwood festivals in July, 2015, in Ohio. <a href=""http://www.starwoodfestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Starwood</a> is the largest pagan festival in the United States, and X-Day is a very cheap festival for my <a href=""http://subgenius.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">church</a> at the same location just before that. Both events will be full of people in my primary audience: the neopagan community. At these events, I hope to find the ~8 additional students I need to support myself working on the School full-time. I will also meet with the headmaster of the <a href=""http://www.greyschool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Grey School of Wizardry</a> in California, the legendary Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, and talk about running a school of magic with him.</p>
<p>Here is a <b>detailed budget:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$238—Round-trip bus ticket Seattle-Michigan</li>
<li>$35—X-Day ticket</li>
<li>$195—Starwood ticket</li>
<li>$165—Gas to X-Day and Starwood (fueleconomy.gov estimates + 25% buffer)</li>
<li>$400—Food for 20 days ($20/day)</li>
<li>$100—Safety buffer for travel</li>
<li>$25—500 business cards</li>
<li>$25—Ad in Starwood's booklet</li>
<li>$150—Cover indiegogo's fees and credit card fees (8-14% total)</li>
</ul>
<div>Total: $1,501</div>
<p>The Internet School of Magic is beginning with me teaching weekly classes and helping clients improve their lives. There are big plans for its expansion (see below). <b>Your contribution will help to launch the School at a pivotal time!</b></p>
<p><b>You will receive</b> the perks listed in the sidebar. I believe in a gift economy and in the importance of not turning anyone away seeking spiritual guidance or relief, so I am attempting to run the school on a donation/slide-scale basis. This indiogogo campaign is part of that dream of running the finances for my business in a fully ethical fashion that makes my services available to all. I am excited to meet each new client/student/donor, so please feel free to contact me immediately after you have made your pledge.</p>
<p><b>If the fundraising goal is not met,</b> the funds will still be used to finance a trip to part of the listed events, if possible. I will still use that time to make connections and advertise the School, but I will not be able to attend both X-Day and Starwood. If the funds are inadequate to finance the trip at all, I will use the funds for living expenses as I continue to work on growing and advertising the school full-time.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is Critical Activism?</h3>
<div>
<p>Critical activism means that I try to work on the highest leverage points. This is why I went into Psychology in the first place: because for me, the highest leverage point is the enlightenment of one individual mind at a time. It is incredibly difficult—but fully possible—to help someone become more awake and aware, and mastering this skill is my primary area of research. I study sapience—the ineffeble quality that makes us human—and initation, the beginning of things and the process of welcoming new humans to life and sapience. In other words, I study how to smoothly, quickly, and painlessly pop people out of the Matrix. Critical activism is the much broader project of trying to pop <i>everyone</i> out of the Matrix at once—to do this, we must create a decentralized, peer-education movement which can spread the political wisdom and conversation needed to end the reign of Fox News and the spectacle of lies citizens are presented with by corrupt institutions. This is post-Occupy activism intended to <i>win</i>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can see some of the community work I have been doing by visiting the subreddit <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">/r/sorceryofthespectacle</a>. I am the primary admin of this subreddit, and I have been carefully nourishing the community since its inception with careful curation and by writing posts intended to nudge the community in constructive directions. This subreddit is fairly representative of the type of perspective I bring to bear in the School of Magic as well: described recently by one redditor as ""the intersection where post-structuralism and the occult meet"", my research is far beyond accusations commonly leveled at occultism (nonsense, useless, or unrigorous) or academia (out-of-touch, pretentious, or inaccessible). This is why I call my approach <i>critical occultism </i>and <i>critical activism</i>: I take the most holistic, complex, contemporary perspectives I can find, and I combine and collate them with the most ancient, specialized, or encoded perspectives I can understand. All of this research is streamlined with the single-minded goal of application in helping people and creating political and self-educational victories for the 99%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is one reason that I named this project the ""Internet"" School of Magic, and why I describe myself as a ""co-founder"" even though I am the sole founder of this particular project: collating many perspectives like this, including neuroscience, psychology, comparative religion, shamanism, critical theory, many occult traditions, etc. is a process of looking not at the similarities or dissimilarities between systems, but rather at the gaps between them and the meaning of those gaps. I call this method <i>critical transyncretism </i>because it attempts to bridge the disconnect between a perennialist approach, which loses historical detail and tends to appropriate cultural specificity, and a genealogical or purely analytic approach, which loses relevance to any human passion. This is the 'inter-' part of the School. The Internet is a new thing, and it has and will continue to create a new planetary consciousness—the Internet School of Magic is one of many projects that are raising this consciousness and attempting to unite the people of Earth behind a banner of love and solidarity, against the few despots who continue to oppress us.</p>
</div>
<h3>Impact &amp; Future Directions</h3>
<p>The Internet School of Magic has only just officially launched, but I am already helping my clients and students become stronger, more balanced, and more capable in handling their lives. Every client that comes to me gets a warm, personal interaction where I give them customized magical/conceptual tools for their situation. Several clients so far have expressed deep thanks for the support and advice I was able to offer during a trying time. (The details are confidential and obviously, my services are not intended as treatment for mental health. I am a positive psychologist so I focus on radically building strengths.)</p>
<p>This project may start small, but I have <b>big plans for expansion</b>. At first, the School will exist as me teaching classes and helping clients. Here are some later projects that I will start once I am able to work on the School and its expansion full-time:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>TEAM—The Transliminal Earth Alliance Metanarrative: A project to create a set of viral protocols for critical activism and mutual education. This will be a project of viral illuminati education. (This project is already being developed behind-the-scenes.)</li>
<li>JANUS—The Jobs Action Network for Underappreciated Scholars: Philosophy &amp; other liberal arts departments are under attack, and searching for a job in these fields is a soulcrushing experience. Let's change that by creating a highly-efficient network for job distribution and campaigning for better philosophy-related jobs!</li>
<li>Moonlight Software—Software development arm of the School. I study interface design and how screens condition subjectivity. Eventually, advanced ""moonlight"" apps will be developed which are intended for use either at night or in altered states. These apps will help students to train their minds in ways that have never been attempted before with a software interface. These apps will also be designed to help enter, exit, and navigate altered states, i.e., ""digital drugs"".</li>
<li>Global Hostel Travel Network—Eventually, I would like to try establishing a global network of teachers, students, and hostels in order to make global learning an affordable experience. Using flocking algorithms, we can route teachers and interested students to shared locales so that ad-hoc meetups can form between interested peers and teachers. Just a seed of an idea now, this network has the potential to compete with big universities by offering a global learning and travel experience for a fraction of the price.</li>
<li>Critical Psychiatry and Patients' Rights—The psychiatric patients locked up or drugged into normalcy are our generation's shamans, prophets, and poets—and rather than being welcomed into a world of artists/priests/poets/prophets, our weird friends are being locked up in a sort of Azkaban. By advocating for patients' rights and by publicly using a language of magic, I hope to build alternative powers that can help people during spiritual crisis without drugs or coercion and with a mythic ear.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>
<p>Starting something like ""The Internet School of Magic"" is an absurdly risky career move. It's easy to criticize me as a charlatan or an insane and deluded new-age crystal-waver. However, I think my education speaks for itself: I studied Psychology at University of Washington, and and I studied Educational Psychology &amp; Educational Technology at the PhD level in Michigan (left early with a master's). I have studied critical theory and critical approaches to activism and pedagogy extensively.</p>
<p>The primary actual challenge for me in lauching this school is getting enough donating students to support myself with the School as my primary income. This will allow me to dedicate all of my time to the School—expanding the curriculum, networking with activists and other teachers, and starting the social and political projects I have in the pipeline—rather than having to spend my days worrying about how I will pay the bills. Right now I have 4 paying students, and if I were able to triple that number, I think I would be just fine and and would consider the school ""launched"".</p>
<p>Therefore, I encourage you to consider your donation a buying-in to the school as a new student (or a client requesting other services such as healing or technical exorcism). Ongoing students who are able to offer the suggested $20/class at four classes per month will be the lifeblood of the School in its early stages.</p>
<p>If I fail in this push to launch the school with this indiegogo campaign, I will have to take a day job in order to make ends meet. This will greatly slow down the launching of the school as a standalone business, since I will have less time to devote to advertising and may have limited time for existing clients, as well. <b>Please help me to meet the fundraising goal so I can move ahead on my dream job at full speed!</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>The best way you can help is to become a student at the $20/class level—and if you can make an $80 or more contribution to this campaign, that will start your first month of classes! However, there are other ways to help as well:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign with your friends.</li>
<li>Ask your friends who might be interested in my classes or other services to check out my website. Follow up and let them know I need new students now :-). Maybe you have friends who are pagan, interested in the occult, or into conspiracy theories or ""the illuminati""—all these topics fall within my research, as well as the neuroscience of self-awareness, for example.</li>
<li>Buy your friend a class as a gift—$20 is the suggested price per class for the first month of classes, and I would be happy to send them an additional free class, which I offer to all new students.</li>
<li>My website, <a href=""http://internetschoolofmagic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">internetschoolofmagic.com</a> does not yet work well on small screens. I can fix this problem myself eventually, but if some kind web designer wants to donate their services to helping me fix this problem—or even helping me to spruce up the site with a nicer design in general—I would be very grateful, as it would save me 40+ hours learning how to make my website follow standards of ""responsive web design"".</li>
<li>Put up a sign or poster in your business or workplace with my website.</li>
<li>Even if you can't offer any money, please feel free to come to me with your questions or spiritual issues. Maybe I can help you get to a place where you are able to afford a donation :-). I love helping people so it's very exciting to have people to help.</li>
</ul>
<div>Thank you very much for reading and if you haven't yet, please check out <a href=""http://internetschoolofmagic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">internetschoolofmagic.com</a> and consider making a donation or becoming a student! Donations made through this campaign are best, because if the goal is met, the fees will be cut in half!</div>

<p>Hi everyone! My name is Ivo Reis, i’m Portuguese and I’ve 26 years old! I’m currently enrolled in a Master Degree in History, International Relations and Cooperation at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Porto (after finishing a Degree in Biology), besides I’ve a <i>part-time</i> job in a Human Resources company, to help cover the costs of Education and other needs. I'm also doing a Summer Internship at the Youth Foundation and I'm associated with other roles and initiatives, all unpaid, such as, for example, the Senate of the University of Porto and the newly created Ibero-american Young Leaders Network (cf. my Linkedin page: <a href=""https://pt.linkedin.com/in/reisivo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://pt.linkedin.com/in/reisivo</a>). I was also recently selected to be the EU Careers Ambassador for Portugal, in the next school year.</p>
<p>On July 14th, I got an email confirmation of my selection as portuguese ‘representative’ for a leadership academy, <i>Preparing Global Leaders Academy,</i> taking place in Jordan, between the 24<sup>th</sup> and the 30<sup>th</sup> of August. The major goal of this Academy is to prepare young people with an excellent academic record, not only with regard to the average, but in all its magnitude, for a new global leadership paradigm.</p>
<p>The Organizing Foundation has granted me a scholarship of 400 dollars, and has encouraged me to carry out an action of fundraising to cover the remaining 600 dollars of the tuition fee, and the travel costs.

My name is Ivo Reis, i’m Portuguese and I’ve 26 years old! I’m currently enrolled in a Master Degree in History, International Relations and Cooperation at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Porto (after finishing a Degree in Biology), besides I’ve a part-time job in a Human Resources company, to help cover the costs of Education and other needs. I'm also doing a Summer Internship at the Youth Foundation and I'm associated with other roles and initiatives, all unpaid, such as, for example, the Senate of the University of Porto and the newly created Ibero-american Young Leaders Network (cf. my Linkedin page: https://pt.linkedin.com/in/reisivo). I was also recently selected to be the EU Careers Ambassador for Portugal, in the next school year.
On July 14th, I got an email confirmation of my selection as portuguese ‘representative’ for a leadership academy, Preparing Global Leaders Academy, taking place in Jordan, between the 24th and the 30th of August. The major goal of this Academy is to prepare young people with an excellent academic record, not only with regard to the average, but in all its magnitude, for a new global leadership paradigm.
The Organizing Foundation has granted me a scholarship of 400 dollars, and has encouraged me to carry out an action of fundraising to cover the remaining 600 dollars of the tuition fee, and the travel costs. That is why I’m launching this crowdfunding campaign to see if perhaps you’re open to the possibility of sponsor my participation on this program. As the Ministerial Bodies and the Deputies from my country which I tried to reach didn't even bothered to answer, nor even the Presidency answered the message sent, and most of the Foundations I contacted were unable to contribute, this seems to be the only way to be able to attend this learning program.

</ul><p>-------------------</p><h3>Qui sommes-nous?</h3><p>Claude Gagnon est enseignant en éducation spécialisée et Anne-Marie Belley est ergothérapeute. Nous avons séjourné à de multiples reprises au Guatemala, directement dans des familles dans diverses communautés, et avons pu voir comment les jeunes adultes peinent à combler leurs besoins quotidiens. Nous avons constaté que plusieurs d'entre eux n'avaient pas l'opportunité d'aller à l'école ou d'avoir un emploi stable. Nous avons pu voir que ce manquement à ce droit de base perpétuait le cycle vicieux de la pauvreté et de l'exclusion sociale.</p><h3>Quel est notre objectif?</h3><p>Nous avons tellement été touchés que nous avons décidé de réfléchir sur la meilleure manière de leur venir en aide, considérant nos professions respectives. Étant donné que plusieurs jeunes n'ont pas les compétences techniques normalement aquises à l'école, par exemple comment utiliser un ordinateur, parler en anglais, faire de la comptabilité, ils se retrouvent souvent face à l'obstacle de na pas avoir les pré-requis nécessaires quand vient le temps de trouver un emploi décent, aux conditions stables. <strong>C'est dans ce contexte qu'est né notre projet projet de développer une formation gratuite, pratique et intensive leur permettant d'acquérir les compétences nécessaires à devenir autonomes et à accéder au marché du travail dès la fin de leur formation.</strong></p><p>Pour financer cette éducation gratuite, nous offrirons aux gens de voyager avec nous sur le site même de l'école; ils verront ainsi la manière dont l'école fonctionne et leur argent, utilisé, et fourniront aux étudiants l'opportunité de mettre en pratique les connaissances et compétences enseignées au cours de leur formation.</p><p>Dans cette perspective, les voyageurs visiteront le pays en étant guidés par les étudiants eux-mêmes, qui apprendront ainsi à valoriser et à utiliser les ressources de leur pays. Au cours de leur fomation, les étudiants apprendront des compétences pratiques telles que communiquer en anglais et en français, à pêcher, à cuisiner, à jardiner, etc. Tous ces apprentissages ont pour objectif de les habiliter à recevoir les visiteurs, mais également à préparer leur transition vers le marché du travail à la fin de leur formation.</p><p>En effet, les étudiants choisiront avant la fin de leur formation l'une des compétences qui leur aura été enseignée et développeront un plan pour utiliser cette compétence pour en faire une profession. À l'intérieur même de l'école, nous avons un budget pour attribuer des prêts aux étudiants pour leur permettre de se procurer les outils, l'équipement requis pour entreprendre leur projet d'entrepreunariat. Une entente signée par l'administration de l'école et les étudiants déterminera que le prêt sera remboursé lorsque leurs revenus leur permettont de le faire, et les remboursements seront redistribués parmi les futurs étudiants.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>En résumé, notre objectif est d'aider les étudiants à apprendre des compétences pratiques, à s'ouvrir aux autres, à gagner de la confiance en eux-mêmes et en les autres, ainsi qu'à prendre le contrôle de leur situation et à devenir des citoyens actifs de leur communauté.</strong></p><h3>Quelle est l'étape suivante?</h3><p>Nous effectuons en ce moment un voyage promotionnel, du Canada au Guatemala, pour rencontrer des gens, passer le mot sur notre projet et créer des connections et des partenariats pour bâtir une équipe solide pour soutenir le développement du projet.</p><p>Une fois arrivés au Guatemala, <strong>notre objectif est d'acheter un terrain dans le Sud-Ouest du Guatemala </strong>afin de commencer la construction de l'école et recevoir notre première cohorte d'étudiants et de voyageurs prévue pour la fin de 2017. <strong>Le coût estimé pour un terrain d'environ 100 000 pieds carré est de US $50,000 au Guatemala. </strong>Nous avons besoin d'un terrain de cette taille pour construire un bâtiment central pour l'école, les bureaux de l'administration et une cafétéria, un second pour loger les étudiants et un autre pour les voyageurs, ainsi qu'un jardin pour cultiver des légumes et des fruits. Nous prévoyons également ajouter d'autres bâtiments (ex.: pavillon pour accueillir les volontaires, atelier dédié aux tâches mécaniques, espaces extérieurs communs), dans les prochaines ultérieures du projet.</p><p>La deuxième étape du projet, pour laquelle nous nécessitons également un support financier, est de construire le bâtiment central pour l'école, et deux pavillons, soit un pour loger les étudiants et le second pour loger les voyageurs. Considérant les coûts de construction au Guatemala, nous estimons que les coûts pour cette étape seront de <strong>US$50,000.</strong></p><p>Lorsque nous aurons atteint notre objectif, nous serons en mesure de mettre en oeuvre nos activités académiques et touristiques, et ainsi avoir une source de revenus afin d'être aussi autonome financièrement que possible.</p><p>Si nous n'atteignons pas notre objectif, nous utiliserons les fonds récoltés pour faire un dépôt pour le terrain, ou en faire l'achat dépendamment du montant collecté, et pour construire une salle de classe de base pour atteindre nos objectif d'avoir notre première cohorte d'éducation à la fin de l'année 2017. Dans ce cas, nous serons toujours en mesure d'accueillir des visiteurs, mais ces derniers seront logés dans des hôtels près du site de l'école, et les bâtiments pour eux seront construits plus tard.</p><h3>Comment pouvez-nous aider à y arriver?</h3><p>Nous offrons une diversité d'options sur la façon dont vous pouvez nous offrir votre support, incluant des communications directes avec nous, des cadeaux pour les amoureux de culture qui vous feront découvrir le Guatemala, de l'équipement de camping pour les plus aventureux et d'autres formes de contributions directes pour l'école.</p><p>Nous voulons être certains que nos contreparties peuvent d'une manière ou d'une autre vous démontrer combien vos contributions et votre support sont appréciés, et aidants pour nous!</p><p><strong>Tout aide!</strong></p><p>Si vous n'êtes pas en mesure de nous aider financièrement, nous apprécierions grandement si vous pouviez passer le mot sur notre campagne aux gens que vous connaissez.

-------------------Qui sommes-nous?Claude Gagnon est enseignant en éducation spécialisée et Anne-Marie Belley est ergothérapeute. Nous avons séjourné à de multiples reprises au Guatemala, directement dans des familles dans diverses communautés, et avons pu voir comment les jeunes adultes peinent à combler leurs besoins quotidiens. Nous avons constaté que plusieurs d'entre eux n'avaient pas l'opportunité d'aller à l'école ou d'avoir un emploi stable. Nous avons pu voir que ce manquement à ce droit de base perpétuait le cycle vicieux de la pauvreté et de l'exclusion sociale.Quel est notre objectif?Nous avons tellement été touchés que nous avons décidé de réfléchir sur la meilleure manière de leur venir en aide, considérant nos professions respectives. Étant donné que plusieurs jeunes n'ont pas les compétences techniques normalement aquises à l'école, par exemple comment utiliser un ordinateur, parler en anglais, faire de la comptabilité, ils se retrouvent souvent face à l'obstacle de na pas avoir les pré-requis nécessaires quand vient le temps de trouver un emploi décent, aux conditions stables. C'est dans ce contexte qu'est né notre projet projet de développer une formation gratuite, pratique et intensive leur permettant d'acquérir les compétences nécessaires à devenir autonomes et à accéder au marché du travail dès la fin de leur formation.Pour financer cette éducation gratuite, nous offrirons aux gens de voyager avec nous sur le site même de l'école; ils verront ainsi la manière dont l'école fonctionne et leur argent, utilisé, et fourniront aux étudiants l'opportunité de mettre en pratique les connaissances et compétences enseignées au cours de leur formation.Dans cette perspective, les voyageurs visiteront le pays en étant guidés par les étudiants eux-mêmes, qui apprendront ainsi à valoriser et à utiliser les ressources de leur pays. Au cours de leur fomation, les étudiants apprendront des compétences pratiques telles que communiquer en anglais et en français, à pêcher, à cuisiner, à jardiner, etc. Tous ces apprentissages ont pour objectif de les habiliter à recevoir les visiteurs, mais également à préparer leur transition vers le marché du travail à la fin de leur formation.En effet, les étudiants choisiront avant la fin de leur formation l'une des compétences qui leur aura été enseignée et développeront un plan pour utiliser cette compétence pour en faire une profession. À l'intérieur même de l'école, nous avons un budget pour attribuer des prêts aux étudiants pour leur permettre de se procurer les outils, l'équipement requis pour entreprendre leur projet d'entrepreunariat. Une entente signée par l'administration de l'école et les étudiants déterminera que le prêt sera remboursé lorsque leurs revenus leur permettont de le faire, et les remboursements seront redistribués parmi les futurs étudiants.En résumé, notre objectif est d'aider les étudiants à apprendre des compétences pratiques, à s'ouvrir aux autres, à gagner de la confiance en eux-mêmes et en les autres, ainsi qu'à prendre le contrôle de leur situation et à devenir des citoyens actifs de leur communauté.Quelle est l'étape suivante?Nous effectuons en ce moment un voyage promotionnel, du Canada au Guatemala, pour rencontrer des gens, passer le mot sur notre projet et créer des connections et des partenariats pour bâtir une équipe solide pour soutenir le développement du projet.Une fois arrivés au Guatemala, notre objectif est d'acheter un terrain dans le Sud-Ouest du Guatemala afin de commencer la construction de l'école et recevoir notre première cohorte d'étudiants et de voyageurs prévue pour la fin de 2017. Le coût estimé pour un terrain d'environ 100 000 pieds carré est de US $50,000 au Guatemala. Nous avons besoin d'un terrain de cette taille pour construire un bâtiment central pour l'école, les bureaux de l'administration et une cafétéria, un second pour loger les étudiants et un autre pour les voyageurs, ainsi qu'un jardin pour cultiver des légumes et des fruits. Nous prévoyons également ajouter d'autres bâtiments (ex.: pavillon pour accueillir les volontaires, atelier dédié aux tâches mécaniques, espaces extérieurs communs), dans les prochaines ultérieures du projet.La deuxième étape du projet, pour laquelle nous nécessitons également un support financier, est de construire le bâtiment central pour l'école, et deux pavillons, soit un pour loger les étudiants et le second pour loger les voyageurs. Considérant les coûts de construction au Guatemala, nous estimons que les coûts pour cette étape seront de US$50,000.Lorsque nous aurons atteint notre objectif, nous serons en mesure de mettre en oeuvre nos activités académiques et touristiques, et ainsi avoir une source de revenus afin d'être aussi autonome financièrement que possible.Si nous n'atteignons pas notre objectif, nous utiliserons les fonds récoltés pour faire un dépôt pour le terrain, ou en faire l'achat dépendamment du montant collecté, et pour construire une salle de classe de base pour atteindre nos objectif d'avoir notre première cohorte d'éducation à la fin de l'année 2017. Dans ce cas, nous serons toujours en mesure d'accueillir des visiteurs, mais ces derniers seront logés dans des hôtels près du site de l'école, et les bâtiments pour eux seront construits plus tard.Comment pouvez-nous aider à y arriver?Nous offrons une diversité d'options sur la façon dont vous pouvez nous offrir votre support, incluant des communications directes avec nous, des cadeaux pour les amoureux de culture qui vous feront découvrir le Guatemala, de l'équipement de camping pour les plus aventureux et d'autres formes de contributions directes pour l'école.Nous voulons être certains que nos contreparties peuvent d'une manière ou d'une autre vous démontrer combien vos contributions et votre support sont appréciés, et aidants pour nous!Tout aide!Si vous n'êtes pas en mesure de nous aider financièrement, nous apprécierions grandement si vous pouviez passer le mot sur notre campagne aux gens que vous connaissez.
