<p><strong>My daughters continue to ask for their grandmother. They don't understand why she isn't coming home, why they can't see her face or hear her voice.

<p><strong>My mother was a very kind and loving person. She was a Nurse at Sunrise Hospital. She helped people on a daily basis. She loved everyone.

<p>SCHOOL DINING ROOM and KITCHEN RENOVATION + YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS</p>
<p>                                   = PROMOTING HEALTHY EATING HABITS AT A YOUNG AGE</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Harbor Country Day School is a Preschool through Grade 8 non-sectarian, non-profit independent school with a fun and exciting summer camp. In 1958, the school began with a gift; a group of parents purchased the buildings and grounds of Tulip Knoll. Founded by energetic and generous local parents, Harbor Country Day School cherishes childhood, cultivates wonder, and inspires confident learners and leaders.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>No independent school can exist on tuition dollars alone. We are dependent on the good will and the generosity of our community. <strong>As the Parents' Association President at Harbor Country Day School, I am starting this campaign to raise the money necessary to renovate the school’s dining room and kitchen facilities.</strong> We want to be able to provide healthy and well-balanced meals and all the nutrition needed for the kids to succeed at school. <strong>We want to serve nutrition every day.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our campaign is focused on shaping children’s eating habits by providing healthy choices at snack time and at lunch time. Our current dining room and kitchen facilities and equipment are out dated and cumbersome, not utilizing the limited space in the best possible way. Our renovation plans include adding a salad and soup bar, and upgrading our kitchen equipment so that we may have a functioning kitchen to prepare and serve a greater array of healthy options for our children. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED TO PROMOTE HEALTHY EATING?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Below, I share staggering statistics which reveal the importance of doing our part to better serve our children and their future by encouraging them to adopt a healthy lifestyle starting at a young age, bite by bite!</strong></p>
<p>Research shows that healthy eating can improve children's concentration and help them do better in school, says pediatric behavioral nutritionist Janice Baranowski from Baylor University in Houston. Baranowski adds that getting the proper nutrients is especially important for young brains that are still growing and developing. Nutritionist Beth Reardon from Duke University's integrative medicine center in Durham, North Carolina, adds that research also suggests that certain foods may affect kids with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, either in a positive or a negative way.<br/><br/>Read more: <a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/192724-how-does-healthy-eating-affect-childrens-concentration/#ixzz24Q7WaWq7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.livestrong.com/article/192724-how-does-healthy-eating-affect-childrens-concentration/#ixzz24Q7WaWq7</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Stamina</h2>
<ul>
<li>Children need the food from lunch to fuel their bodies and keep them alert for the rest of their school day. A healthy lunch provides this fuel, while an unhealthy lunch makes children more sluggish and unaware. Kids who eat a healthy lunch are more prepared for their school day.</li>
</ul><h2>Full Stomach</h2>
<ul>
<li>Children do not always eat well at home. Lunch may be the only healthy food they get on any given day. A healthy lunch may provide these children with the foods they need to fill their stomach at least once a day.</li>
</ul><h2>Knowledge</h2>
<ul>
<li>A healthy lunch teaches children about eating healthy. They will learn what is healthy versus what isn't and how their bodies react to different types of foods. They will also learn what a balanced meal looks like and hopefully be able to re-create those meals for themselves someday.</li>
</ul><h2>Physical Health</h2>
<ul>
<li>We know that good foods are good for our bodies, and because children are constantly growing and developing, they need good, healthy lunches to promote healthy growth. Unhealthy school lunches only help children grow more round, while healthy cafeteria food help them grow tall and strong.</li>
</ul><h2>Mental Health</h2>
<ul>
<li>The University of Michigan Health System has shown that children who eat a healthy lunch with a limited amount of sugar tend to learn better than when they have an unhealthy lunch, no lunch, or lunch with a lot of sugar and carbohydrates.</li>
</ul><h2>Comfort</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some children may get some comfort from their healthy lunch. It shows that somebody actually cares about him/her and is willing to make healthy foods and spend a little more money on those healthy foods rather than serving them unhealthy foods.</li>
</ul><h2> </h2>
<p>Obesity Among Children and Adolescents</p>
<p>In 2009-2010, 16.9 percent of children and adolescents aged 2-19 years were obese. This includes 18.6 percent of boys and 15.0 percent of girls.</p>
<p>Among children and adolescents aged 2-19:</p>
<ul>
<li>The prevalence of obesity was higher among adolescents than among preschool-aged children.</li>
<li>The prevalence of obesity was higher among boys than girls.</li>
<li>Among children and adolescents aged 2-19, more than 5 million girls and 7 million boys were obese.</li>

<h1><strong>The Journey &amp; The Genesis</strong></h1>
<p>One evening in 2009, an old college colleague called. The family had been seeing the specialist but was now completely frustrated with the lack of answers and no apparent resolution. I interviewed them a bit more and had them write down my recommended plan. I told them to be very polite with the Specialist, but ask if he could accommodate my plan- I had recommended a particular surgery. </p>
<p>One week later they called back- the surgery was done, and it was a huge success! I was humbled by the experience but I also felt troubled by it....It was then that I had the epiphany. I thought to myself how much healthier the world would be if as Physicians we were all communicating more and if we were more connected with our patients.  This was the tipping point, and so I decided to create the means to grant improved healthcare access to all.  In December 2009 I started my R&amp;D.</p>
<h1><strong>R&amp;D</strong></h1>
<p>As tedious as R&amp;D sounds, I've been having a whale of a time at it. The truth is, I had formal Computer Science training prior to medical school and so I'm comfortable in the zone. Our research was extensive, exhaustive and expensive but definitely worth every effort we put in. We covered everything from internet law and the HIPAA Technical Standards, to mobile commerce, mHealth trends, iOS, Google, and their myriad of SDK's. In spite of all that was available, nothing met my full requirements and so I had to do some designing.</p>
<p>The design focus was client-centric and it started with the question: ""If there is a patient/client in a new city and knowing no one, how could that person get access to a physician with minimal hassle?"" My answer, ""Connect directly to a Physician"". My next question: ""How?"" And this was the question I answered with the design. At the end of several months of hibernation and 18 hour days,  the SpeakWithDoc Concept was born.</p>
<p>We reviewed the requirements and then went shopping for additional developers. Due to the nature of the interface we had development teams in California, New York, Texas, and Pennsylvania. We finally released our Beta in January 2012. To date, we still have not released the entire interface and that is what this project is about.</p>
<h1><strong>Our Experience With The SpeakWithDoc Beta</strong></h1>
<p>We've had thousands of exchanges with users from all across the US, and across the globe. We have assisted users in London,  Egypt, Ireland, Spain, Australia, India, the United Arab Emirates, the Caribbean, among others. We have assisted the entire age range of iPhone and Android owners from teenagers to grandmothers.</p>
<h1>Problems, Solutions, &amp; Benefits</h1>
<p><strong>Second Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so you just returned from the doctor, you have a bunch of medications but for some reason you are still not sure what is happening or what each medication is for. So what can you do? Well, with the SpeakWithDoc app you can securely get a second opinion or get additional information from one of our physicians. Additionally, you could have our Pharmacist help you understand the medications you received. Problem Solved </p>
<p><strong>College Students</strong></p>
<p>You are in college or you have kids in college. At this stage, being away from home and having sensitive health issues to deal with, do college kids want to call their parents? Probably not. Do parents want them to take advice from other college friends about their health? Again, probably not. Enter SpeakWithDoc and the student gets to speak privately with his physician or with our physician on the fly. Now everyone is happy, Problem Solved.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Surgery</strong></p>
<p>You've just had surgery, and you are at home recovering. It's a rainy Sunday afternoon, but you are fairly comfy at home watching the football game. Suddenly you feel a slight pain in the area of the surgery and it looks a little different to you. Your Surgeon's office is closed but there is an ER about an hour away, what do you do? Enter SpeakWithDoc. You open a chat with your physician and send him your symptoms. From the SpeakWithDoc interface you also send him a couple pictures of the surgical area. He reviews it, assures you that its ok and your Sunday relaxation is saved. No need for a trip to the ER. Problem Solved.</p>
<p><strong>Chronic Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>You are diabetic and hypertensive and you have a pharmacy of medications to take- which you tend to forget because there are simply too many. You have several complications of these chronic illnesses and you experience new symptoms quite often. Many times you don't know what to do and you feel scared. You visit your doctor for your regular appointments and you don't even know where to begin. In any case, there wouldn't be enough time. So how can SpeakWithDoc help? </p>
<p>Well, as the symptoms appear, you could easily start an instant chat and have an immediate discussion with one of our physicians who would provide you with the information and guidance you seek. even while the symptoms are taking place. Using our Medication Reminder System, you could enter all your medications and get prompt reminders of when to take each medication. This combined assistance would prove invaluable in improving your general health. So there you have it, Problem Solved.</p>
<p><strong>The Newbie</strong></p>
<p>So, you have just moved into town and you need to find a physician. If you find one, then you need to schedule an appointment. So what do you do? You open your SpeakWithDoc App, head to the Health Tools, and choose ""Near Me"". You are provided with list of health providers and their location in relation to you. do you want to head to one of them? Then just click his name and get directions. Or probably you prefer to schedule an appointment. No problem. back to health tools and choose ""Get Appointment"" (hmmm-clever naming of the choices right?) Now find your provider, choose your time and appointment type and book your slot. You're done!!  Ok, so you're not. You're picky and you want to ask some questions before you go to the appointment. Hhhhmmm- oh well, we can do that. Just send a message from your appointment and voila!!- Problem Solved.</p>
<p><strong>Home Care</strong></p>
<p>So you take care of your Mom or your Nan who lives at home with you. She needs her Cholesterol checked and her doctor tells you this has to be done in the morning before she eats anything.  The problem- you are on the morning shift at work and you have already used up all your allowed time, plus your commute is an hour and fifteen minutes one way. What do you do? Elementary really... Launch your SpeakWithDoc App, go to ""My Health Tools"", choose her Cholesterol Test, enter her info and address, submit. Her Test Kit arrives in the mail, you do a finger stick early the next morning, and on your way out you deposit the pre-labeled return envelope containing her sample in the mail box. You're done!! Problem Solved. Anything else...? I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>More Solutions...?</strong></p>
<p>Now I am going to stop myself here because I am sure that by now you get the picture. SpeakWithDoc solves a tremendous number of health related logistical problems. We connect you to what you need, when you need it. Its that simple.</p>
<div>
<h1>What We Have Accomplished:</h1>
<p>We already have an Android &amp; iOS Beta application that provide the LiveChat, the Health Trivia, and a few other functionalities. This has been of tremendous help to the users we have had over the last several months. We have submitted our algorithm for Patent protection and have secured several trademarks and copyrights for works related to SpeakWithDoc. Our development has been managed by myself and Bill, my cofounder and software developer. Because of the scope of the project's design, Bill creates the architectural framework and then we use teams across the US to complete different sections of our requirements. It has been an interesting and demanding process. </p>
<h1><strong>What We Hope To Accomplish With Your Help</strong></h1>
<p>On the face of it, we have made the SpeakWithDoc App pretty simple and user friendly but the algorithm powering this baby is anything but simple. Unlike most other applications, we are coding for bandwidth considerations, HIPAA level security, SSL encryptions, response times, device security, various server authentication protocols, management of direct communications, secure calendars and much more. All this is done while also providing our users with basic click to calls, maps, click to email, and health education through our Health Trivia Game.</p>
<p>The sheer scope of what I am trying to accomplish could be considered overwhelming but we don't think so, we have been working tirelessly for the past three years. The first thing we want to accomplish is to share this vision with you, a vision of improved access to healthcare information and healthcare providers. A technologically driven environment where your care is no longer limited by your geography or who you know. Instead you will always have access to health information, healthcare providers and appointments. We don't want this vision to simply remain with us while we hope to complete it, you deserve to know what we want for you.  </p>
<p>Funding our current goal will achieve several immediate development objectives for our iPhone interface. Our iphone interface already has the major architectural framework needed for these implementations. Our immediate objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A transfer of our server to the Amazon Web Services</li>
<li>Implementing the Physicians' Appointment Calendar</li>
<li>Implementig the Clients' Appointmemt Calendar</li>
<li>Implementing Appointment Reminders</li>
<li>Implementing Refill Reminders</li>
<li>Acquiring and Implementing various healthcare databases </li>
<li>Implementing the automatic ""Near Me"" search functionality</li>
<li>Implementing the Medication Reminders</li>
<li>Implementing All HIPAA Security Protocols</li>
<li>Updating All Source Codes</li>
<li>Implementing All Authentication Protocols</li>
<li>Implementing Updated Server Monitoring Systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Any additional funding received will be directed towards our Android interface as the next priority. If this can be achieved we will then implement the web interface to mirror the app functionality.</p>
<p>Our Target Goal is <strong>Sixty Four Thousand Dollars</strong> ($64,000.00). We ask that you <strong><em>FUND</em></strong> our cause as you see fit. We also ask that you <em><strong>spread the word</strong></em> to family, friends, co-workers and colleagues. Finally we ask that you review our accomplishment to date by downloading and testing our <strong><em>free Beta</em></strong> that is currently in both App Stores. Our heart-felt <strong><em>Thank You</em></strong>,  for considering our project, we appreciate every single effort that will allow one other person to achieve better health.</p>

<h1>Risk And Challenges</h1>
<p class=""dotty"">Product Quality <br/>We have always been challenged to improve the quality of our App, particularly with respect to the user interface and the functionality. My experience with my own patients have allowed me to remain focused on a very client-centric solution, and I have had the benefit of their feedback as we continued to develop the interface. The intricacies of the requirements of our source code have been challenging to some teams due to my design requirements. During these instances, Bill has always been able to focus some attention to the specific problem and code the solution. As one who honed his software skills in the aeronautics industry, Bill provides a multifaceted, solution oriented level of coding to our development. We expect to continue our dedication to this seminal task.</p>
<p>HIPAA Security <br/>Securing Health Related information is of paramount importance to us and to all users of the App, both clients and physicians. We have employed the NIST protocols in implementing the HIPAA Security Rule on our interface. It is out of a serious sense of commitment to this high level of security that we will be transferring our server to Amazon Web Services. As a Family Physician, my commitment to this security process is second to none.</p>
<p>Service Experience <br/>One of the larger challenges that we face is to ensure the service experience of our clients remain at the highest level. As one who has provided exceptional service to my patients over the last several years, I remain vigilant in ensuring that the value that users derive from our app is in keeping with their highest expectations. This is our commitment to the process and to you the user.</p>
<p>Getting The Word Out <br/>One final challenge is getting the word out so people can improve their health by using this interface. We do our best with social media and other tools we have available but we require your help in telling everyone you know about the interface. We have created an Affiliate Program and we will host an Affiliate Challenge so we can add some fun and prizes to the process. Stay tuned to our indiegogo updates, our facebook page, and our website for those announcements.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><img alt=""Clean Water"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ftcenergy.com/cleanwater.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Clean Water""/></p>
<p>You Can Clean Water Contaminants without Chemicals</p>
<p>There is a simple way to clean your water.  According to multiple U.S. Government studies, any time viruses, molds, and bacteria come in contact with copper they are killed.  If you add zinc to the mix, you eliminate chlorine, chloramines, iron, lead, hydrogen sulfide, and hundreds of other problem contaminants from the water supply. It also reduces scale and water hardness.  Scale is a huge problem worldwide.</p>
<p>If you put zinc and copper together in water and do so in a special way, the net effect is these harmless metals interact to destroy virtually all the things in water that harm you.  Using sophisticated software and a 3D printer, we created a product that you can drop into water and clean the water.  Put it in a drinking glass and your water is cleaner.  Put it in your dishwasher and you eliminate water spots, scale, mold, viruses, and bacteria throughout the whole dishwasher load even while you clean the device itself.  And, these devices will be cheap to make and to own.</p>
<p>I got into this because I live in Florida and we have a horrible mold problem.  You can scrub it and bleach it, but it keeps coming back and it is nasty stuff.  I started looking into ways to get rid of the mold that did not involve chemicals.  I kept finding that mold will not survive contact with copper.</p>
<p><img alt=""Closeup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ftcenergy.com/SideBySideCloseUp2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Closeup""/></p>
<p>So I tried a test.  I put two Cool Whip bowls full of plain tap water.  In one bowl, I put just nothing but water.  In the other bowl, I dropped in a copper scrubber.  After a month, the plain water bowl was nasty and had more than just mold.  The bowl with the copper scrubber was crystal clear.  the pictures above tell the story.</p>
<p>I went further.  I decided if copper worked on viruses, bacteria, and mold; what would get rid of all the other contaminants.  I hit on zinc.  Zinc is amazing.  Steel everywhere is coated with zinc so zinc is safe to be around.  But, wait.  There’s more.</p>

<p> </p></div>","You Can Clean Water Contaminants without Chemicals
There is a simple way to clean your water.  According to multiple U.S. Government studies, any time viruses, molds, and bacteria come in contact with copper they are killed.  If you add zinc to the mix, you eliminate chlorine, chloramines, iron, lead, hydrogen sulfide, and hundreds of other problem contaminants from the water supply. It also reduces scale and water hardness.  Scale is a huge problem worldwide.
If you put zinc and copper together in water and do so in a special way, the net effect is these harmless metals interact to destroy virtually all the things in water that harm you.  Using sophisticated software and a 3D printer, we created a product that you can drop into water and clean the water.  Put it in a drinking glass and your water is cleaner.  Put it in your dishwasher and you eliminate water spots, scale, mold, viruses, and bacteria throughout the whole dishwasher load even while you clean the device itself.  And, these devices will be cheap to make and to own.
I got into this because I live in Florida and we have a horrible mold problem.  You can scrub it and bleach it, but it keeps coming back and it is nasty stuff.  I started looking into ways to get rid of the mold that did not involve chemicals.  I kept finding that mold will not survive contact with copper.

So I tried a test.  I put two Cool Whip bowls full of plain tap water.  In one bowl, I put just nothing but water.  In the other bowl, I dropped in a copper scrubber.  After a month, the plain water bowl was nasty and had more than just mold.  The bowl with the copper scrubber was crystal clear.  the pictures above tell the story.
I went further.  I decided if copper worked on viruses, bacteria, and mold; what would get rid of all the other contaminants.  I hit on zinc.  Zinc is amazing.  Steel everywhere is coated with zinc so zinc is safe to be around.  But, wait.  There’s more.

<h2>Your Support</h2>
<h3><b>$0 - $2,500</b></h3>
<h4><b>Kitchen Rental + Distribution + Product Development</b></h4>
<p>Our goal is to raise $2,500. First, we will use the money to pay for kitchen space at an amazing shared kitchen called Kitchen Local in Amesbury, Massachusetts. With this state-of-the-art kitchen, we will be able to craft our buns at a commercial level where we will grow and start to share our delicious flavors with the entire country.<br/></p>

<h3>Your Impact</h3> <p>  With every contribution we get one step closer to bringing our flavors to supermarkets and homes across the country. We want to change the bread industry for the better, forever. We can only do that with your support!</p>
<p><br/></p> <p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>  Based on extensive research and discussions with other industry professionals, the challenge that would most likely cause delays would be delays in FDA approval of product labels and packaging for wholesale production. There are no other risks that we haven't already tackled. As soon as funding is complete we can start taking additional orders almost instantaneously.<p><br/></p>
<p> Once approved, Bread Beaker buns will be in production, shipped to our backers, in supermarkets across the United States and eventually the world!</p>

-Ali                                                                                                                                              Somerville, MA
""The Bread Beaker Buns are a delicious addition to any sandwich. Perhaps the only thing better than the taste is the appetizing smell before you take a bite.""
-David                                                                                                                        Billerica, MA

""Bread Beaker rocks! They supplied the buns for my BBQ of over 20 people. We paired them with hamburgers, turkey burgers, and veggie patties. The Bourbon Buns added a sweet tang, while those interested in more kick, spiced things up with the chipotle. I will be ordering Bread Beaker for all my future parties!""
-Lizzy                                                                                                                          Jamaica Plains, MA


""The Bread Beaker Bourbon Brown Sugar Bun was extremely satisfying paired with a cheeseburger. The subtle sweetness serenaded my taste buds. I will be a loyal customer!""
-Amber                                                                                                                                      Boston, MA

""Bread Beaker Buns add a little zing to your everyday brown bag lunch!""
-Michelle                                                                                                                                     Malden, MA


""They have a light and subtle hint of flavor perfect for any sandwich.""
-Kaitlyn                                                                                                                                      Boston, MA



""The Chipotle Bun is a great way to add a kick to even the most simple sandwiches!""
-Alex                                                                                                                                           Lancaster, MA
"" These buns are delicious! I love the fact that you can intensify the flavor in a burger without adding mounds of condiments and other items. These are a must buy for my next BBQ.

-Jen                                                                                                                                             Charlestown, MA

""Bread Beaker Buns have Changed the way I think about sandwiches. The flavors were prominent but not overpowering, elevating the sandwich. They're soft but also strong enough to hold up to any size burger you want. My favorite was the Chipotle Buns, but I loved them both.
-Mike                                                                                                                                          Billerica, MA


Your Support
$0 - $2,500
Kitchen Rental + Distribution + Product Development
Our goal is to raise $2,500. First, we will use the money to pay for kitchen space at an amazing shared kitchen called Kitchen Local in Amesbury, Massachusetts. With this state-of-the-art kitchen, we will be able to craft our buns at a commercial level where we will grow and start to share our delicious flavors with the entire country.

                                    

In addition, it will be used to pay for state licensing fees, packaging material, bar codes, and product development of new bun flavors. Lastly, this will also allow us to travel to various supermarkets and provide them with all of the necessary paperwork so we can share our flavors with you!


$2,500+
Cross-country Visibility + Additional Product Development
All additional Funding will be dedicated to having Bread Beaker be apart of Food Festivals across the country.
 Some food festivals that we would like to attend to debut our buns include:


Boston Local Food Festival                       Boston, MA
The National Hamburger Festival            Akron, OH
Craft Beer Festival & Burger Bash           Palm Beach Gardens, FL
Austin Food & Wine Festival                      Austin, TX
Savor The Central Coast                            San Luis Obispo, CA

On top of attending these great food festivals we will also use the extra funds to continue to develop more unique and delicious flavors of buns as well as branch out into new categories of bread.

Your Impact   With every contribution we get one step closer to bringing our flavors to supermarkets and homes across the country. We want to change the bread industry for the better, forever. We can only do that with your support!
   
Risks & Challenges    Based on extensive research and discussions with other industry professionals, the challenge that would most likely cause delays would be delays in FDA approval of product labels and packaging for wholesale production. There are no other risks that we haven't already tackled. As soon as funding is complete we can start taking additional orders almost instantaneously.
 Once approved, Bread Beaker buns will be in production, shipped to our backers, in supermarkets across the United States and eventually the world!

<p><span><span></span></span></p><p>The rapid spread of the Ebola Virus Disease throughout Liberia since March 2014 continues to overwhelm the country’s healthcare system, thus limiting the ability of the nation to respond.  In an effort to contain the disease, the President declared a State of Emergency on August 6, instituted a nation-wide curfew and established the National Ebola Task Force. As the outbreak continues to grow, access to information on the risks of Ebola still remain a challenge. The international community understands that West African countries, including Liberia, cannot beat Ebola on their own.

<p>“There is a dire need for emergency response funds and intervention plans. Most hospitals lack basic equipment and are chronically understaffed. Health systems strengthening is crucial”.<br/>

“We can’t lose this battle. We need to scale up the response immediately to ensure that people do not continue to die of preventable diseases and neglect.  Right now, what we do have is a committed young people who have passion in humanity, capacity and strategy to reach out to the most marginalized communities of Liberia. If youth within their various communities can get the message across that, public health workers are working to eradicate the virus, it can mobilize communities to work alongside government in the fight against Ebola.” </p>
<span>This is the first major outbreak of the Ebola virus
in West Africa and communities in the region are struggling to contain the
epidemic. To respond to a public health crisis on this scale, organizations on
the ground need fresh medical supplies for people who have been infected and
protective equipment to prevent further spread of this deadly disease. Your
donation will help buy these vital supplies.<br/><br/>
It’s easy to take it for granted, but educational
campaigns are just as important as gloves and face masks when fighting an
epidemic. Citizens in Liberia lack basic knowledge about Ebola, how it spreads,
and what to do if you think you or a family member might have it. Your donation
will help dispel misinformation and prevent ripple effects that can have
life-and-death consequences.<br/>
Witnessing an epidemic of this severity from afar
can feel overwhelming. We are seeing a rare, deadly disease devastate
communities that have never before dealt with an outbreak on this scale.<br/><br/>

He has suffered from extreme eczema that has caused systemic infections, food allergies (he can't have anything containing milk,eggs,corn,soy,sesame seeds, peanuts,tree nuts and mustard.... we have had to get very inventive :) ), environmental allergies, Asthma, reactive airway disease, sleep apnea, leg deformities and constant infections. He has never gone a single week without being on medications. He is in constant misery but he tries so hard to keep a smile on his face. He is so understanding about not being able to have the same things (food) that other kids can have.( Nathan asked since Santa is magic if he can ask for all of his ""owies and sick"" to go away instead of a present how sweet). Nathan is so brave, he visits doctors on average a couple of times a week. He also has a couple of surgeries coming up in a couple of weeks. The doctors believe that he has a rare genetic disorder called Job syndrome. With this syndrome Nathan has essentially no immune system and it causes bone deformities so it is unhealthy for him to be in a daycare environment. Nathan's mom who is a nurse is no longer able to work so she can stay home with Nathan to keep him as healthy as possible. We held out so much hope that someday he would grow out of all of this and become a healthy little boy that he should be but we found out that there is no cure for Job syndrome, all we can do is treat the infections, home IV therapy and someday maybe a bone marrow transplant. Lifespan for this syndrome is 3-29 years old but we know that Nathan can beat the odds. Our goal is to prevent infections and to keep our little man as comfortable as possible. With all of the medical bills and one less income this has become a huge finical issue. Any money raised will help pay medical bills and to be able to keep Nathan home in a safe environment. Please pass the word around for us. We could use any help we can get. If nothing else, please keep Nathan in your thoughts and share his story with others. This little guy has had to deal with so much that most adults haven't even had to deal with but yet he will be the first to give a warm snuggly hug when someone else is feeling sad. He is so caring and loving.</p></div>","Our four year old little boy, Nathan has been sick his entire life. He has suffered from extreme eczema that has caused systemic infections, food allergies (he can't have anything containing milk,eggs,corn,soy,sesame seeds, peanuts,tree nuts and mustard.... we have had to get very inventive :) ), environmental allergies, Asthma, reactive airway disease, sleep apnea, leg deformities and constant infections. He has never gone a single week without being on medications. He is in constant misery but he tries so hard to keep a smile on his face. He is so understanding about not being able to have the same things (food) that other kids can have.( Nathan asked since Santa is magic if he can ask for all of his ""owies and sick"" to go away instead of a present how sweet). Nathan is so brave, he visits doctors on average a couple of times a week. He also has a couple of surgeries coming up in a couple of weeks. The doctors believe that he has a rare genetic disorder called Job syndrome.

If we will reach that goal we will donate 10 EyeControl sets for patients in developing countries
                             ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease or MND) patients represent a
subgroup of people with fully functional cognitive abilities who gradually lose
their speech and the use of their upper limbs, and cannot communicate with
their environment due to physical limitations (they’re ""locked-in"").
The existing communication
means are expensive, cumbersome to calibrate, but most of all, they're not mobile.

Even if a
patient can afford to buy them, those tools cannot be used without a dedicated
computer.

These means limit the communication to times when patients are in
front of the screen and cannot be used when in bed, on the go (perhaps on a
wheelchair), in the car etc. 

This limits the patient and can endanger their lives.       Improve the quality of life for ""locked-in"" patients by providing a cheap, accessible, automatically calibrated and mobile means of communication.

 An infra-red camera connected to
a simple glasses frame and communicateswith a credit-card sized computer
which identifies and translates the blinks and movements of the user’s eyes
into commands which will output in sound, to earphones and to a speaker. 
In
addition, it can transmit these to a smartphone via bluetooth.
 The smartphone
run application which enables the patient to communicate using text to speech
mechanism.
We provide a 3 modes solution:

An alert sound,calling for assistance.
Choosing from predefined sentences (e.g. ""I'm cold"", ""My hand hurts"", ""I need to pee"").

Composing sentences using virtual boards which resemble the alphabet.






Patent pending 
Working prototype
Application to the Israeli chief scientist office
Last preparations for a pilot with patients - insurance, bug fixes, caregivers etc.
With your help we will bring this innovative solution to the market at an affordable price so “locked-in” patients from all over the world can own one.
With your help we will begin a comprehensive pilot with the participation of dozens of patients in order to make the necessary improvements that make it as effective as possible.
With your help we will design a head mounted device for the camera, improve the eye tracking algorithm, and develop more features for our mobile app.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Trevor Murphy. I am the current Shenango Valley Disc Golf Alliance President as well as the course designer for both Buhl Park Disc Golf Course as well as The Pines at Shenango Lake Disc Golf Course which are both in Hermitage Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>I am a current Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) Member #56033. I have been playing disc golf for over 6 years. I am also a PDGA Tournament Director and Official. I have hosted over 10 events in the past 2 Years in our area.  I also host weekly leagues, indoor putting leagues, and miscellaneous events throughout the year.<br/><br/>The SVDGA is organizing this fundraising attempt for the Buhl Park Tee Pad Campaign.<br/>The Campaign is extremely important for the development of Disc Golf in our area.</p>
<p>One of the most critiqued components of a disc golf course are the available tees. A well built textured concrete tee can reduce negative impressions. The tee usually consists of a flat, level area about five to six feet wide by eight to fifteen feet long. Unlike golf, where players are stationary during the drive, disc golf drives can utilize a walk-up or run-up to generate more power and momentum. Creating an ideal surface for players to throw from will make your course more appealing to new and experienced players alike.</p>
<p>Concrete tees represent the professional standard for disc golf. They require little maintenance when installed correctly. With the right tools, you can create a textured surface that allows players sure footing in most weather conditions. Concrete tees require some preparation and labor to install, but the investment produces a superior tee surface preferred by a wide range of players.<br/><br/>We plan to install 36 5'x12'x4"" Concrete Tee Pads for the Blue and White Tee Areas. In addition to the funds we raise we want to add Mats for all 18 of the remaining Red Tee Areas.<br/><br/>These tee pads would bring a wide variety of play from the Professional Level down to the Recreational Player. The SVDGA would be able to host larger events within the PDGA Standard.<br/>Making Hermitage PA a disc golf destination. Your contributions could help us reach our goals!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently we are working towards a goal of $5000 for Tee Pads for all 54 Tees. A combination of Concrete and Rubber Mats. We hope to prepare, pour, and finish 36 concrete tee pads, Blue and White Tee Areas. We also hope to raise enough for mats for the remaining 18 Red Tee Areas.<br/><br/>How is this all possible you may ask? With the help of Buhl Park as well as other outside contributions, the costs for the Tee Pads is obtainable with this campaign. For every dollar raised we will be <strong>MATCHED dollar for dollar </strong>by outside contributions on what we can raise here on Indiegogo. The entire project is projected to cost close to $10,000.<br/><br/>While not including excavation of the 36 Tee areas. Total Material Costs break down as such:<br/><br/>Concrete Mesh: Available in 5'x150' Rolls. We would need 432' of Concrete Mesh bringing our total of rolls up to 3 at $115 per Roll. Total: $345<br/><br/>Frames: We plan to make 18 Frames while installing the Tee Pads in a 2 part process. The Front and Back 9's.<br/>We need (36) 2""x4""x12' @ $5.04 each = $182<br/>We need (18) 2""x4""x10' (cut in half) @ $4.17 = $75<br/><br/>Aggregate: .7tons per Pad (25 Tons for 36 Pads) = $901 with tax and delivered.<br/><br/>Concrete: Base Mix is 36.75 cubic yards of 4000psi weighted concrete. $4,752.51 with tax and delivered. Adding 1% Non-Chloride to help cure quicker is $194.78.<br/><br/>This brings us to a total of $6,451 for 36 Concrete Pads.<br/><br/>We also plan to install 18 Rubber Mats for the Red Tee Areas: $50 each 4'x6' mat. We will be using 2 Mats to make a total of a 12' Tee Pad. Total of $1800.<br/><br/>With excavation costs being quoted around $5000. Our grand Total for the entire project would be $13,251<br/><br/>With a strong volunteer force this also would not be possible. We are currently looking for help with excavation equipment, concrete pour knowledge, and finishing/texturing the pad.<br/><br/>A range of Perks will be available for  each and every contribution to this goal.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u> Why did we make Lock&amp;Go?</u></h3>
<p>As this armband's inventor,I  am a  sport fanatic, running, cycling, working out in the gym. Like most people i also couldn't leave without my smartphone. Over the years I have been trying out all kinds of armbands, however none of them were truly perfect.  Uncomfortable to wear, keep slipping, struggling accessing to my smartphone when I have to. Not to say the sweat stain and the smell. I complained to some of my friends and found out that they were all having the same bad experience!</p>
<p> Why don't I make one myself which could solve all the problems? ? I started to think. After talking to a number of material engineers and manufacturers, several round of tests and changes, finally figured out the prototype. Nearly 1 year of hard work, I managed to make this armband which I use every day, and I am very proud of it. Now I wish it could benefit more people, so if you were having the same troubles carrying your smartphone when working out, please support us! </p>

As this armband's inventor,I  am a  sport fanatic, running, cycling, working out in the gym. Like most people i also couldn't leave without my smartphone. Over the years I have been trying out all kinds of armbands, however none of them were truly perfect.  Uncomfortable to wear, keep slipping, struggling accessing to my smartphone when I have to. Not to say the sweat stain and the smell. I complained to some of my friends and found out that they were all having the same bad experience!
 Why don't I make one myself which could solve all the problems? ? I started to think. After talking to a number of material engineers and manufacturers, several round of tests and changes, finally figured out the prototype. Nearly 1 year of hard work, I managed to make this armband which I use every day, and I am very proud of it. Now I wish it could benefit more people, so if you were having the same troubles carrying your smartphone when working out, please support us! 

 Incredibly Easy to access to Your PhoneThe unique magnet slot design offers you the easiest way accessing to your smartphone when you are on the go, while keeping it securely fixed on your arm.Truly, No Slip, No JiggleBased on our market research, it’s found out that most of the armbands are made of low elastic fabric with limited friction, so it is almost impossible to fit the arm well and easy to slip when you run or work out. Lock&Go is the world first armband which utilize the eco and skin friendly silicone. The silicone has a just fine frictional effect with your skin or clothes sleeve, with the metal buckle, Lock&Go armband offers a real No Slip,No Jiggle user experience.  Fit Almost Any Arm Size (21-44cm\8.3-17.3Inch)Unlike most of the armband which use low elastic fabric, Lock&Go's high flexibility silicone band offers users a more adjustable arm size span, and enables users to perfectly complete movements such as lifting, barbell concentration curl，push－up etc.. No More Sweat Stain, No More Stinky SmellOne of the most annoying issues with regular armbands is the sweat problem. After short usage, the regular armband would be stained heavily by the sweat, which may also damage the smartphone in the pocket.  Lock&Go is made of silicone and plastic, you can clean it easily with water and dry it up in a minute after running or working out. Also the plastic holding slot perfectly separates your phone from sweaty arm.Elastic Key SlotThe elastic silicone key slot, designed to accommodate most keys. How to Install Lock&GoIt is so easy to set up Lock&Go armband.please watch this tutorial video

<p>Sleep deprivation is one of the biggest problems that people are experiencing today.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to fall asleep after a long and stressful day. Although we eventually sleep, it’s not the good ol’ deep sleep that we need. And the vicious cycle repeats!</p>

<p>Serotonin is one of the neurotransmitters in the brain. This hormone provides a sense of stability, psychological satisfaction, and happiness.</p>
<p>It transforms into melatonin at night, controlling our daily rhythm to keep us healthy by producing enough sleep hormones which make us experience REM in the deep levels of sleep.</p>

<p>CES (Cranial Electric Stimulation) is a type of brain stimulation. This brain electro-stimulation changes the functions of your cranial nervous system by using the same amount of energy that is used in electric or magnetic fields. </p>

</div></div>","Many people visit clinics every year while paying a lot of money to ease their sleep problems. The cost per session can range from $100 to $1000.  

In fact, according to statistics, more than 7 million Americans are suffering from insomnia and other sleep-related problems.

The after effects of these problems can vary from stress, lowered concentration, a weakened immune system, and bad skin.
The number of those who are suffering from sleepless nights continues to increase annually, and of course, they want to solve this life-debilitating problem, and we want to help them.
Introducing the Sleep I Mask

It's difficult to change your busy lifestyle. A lot of us like to stay up late, but then we still want a full night’s rest.
Sleep I Mask is designed for at-home use, so it is compact and portable. It’s an amazing device that helps provide a high quality night’s sleep and body conditioning any place, anytime.

Not only that, it helps frequent flyers who suffer from jet-lag to overcome their sleepiness. Basically, the Sleep I Mask can help anyone who's sleep deprived.
Enjoy a better life with Sleep I Mask, which is powered by CES technology. It will give you a higher quality of life!


The state-of-the-art CES technology produces sleep-triggering hormones and maximizes your sleeping condition.
At the same time, it diminishes the amount of cortisol, which, in turn, reduces stress and improves your immune system.
The impact of CES technology has been examined in many theses and the FDA approved it to be safe and an effective stimulation for cranial use.

.
It's time to go to bed
Sleep deprivation is one of the biggest problems that people are experiencing today.
It can be difficult to fall asleep after a long and stressful day. Although we eventually sleep, it’s not the good ol’ deep sleep that we need. And the vicious cycle repeats!

Serotonin is one of the neurotransmitters in the brain. This hormone provides a sense of stability, psychological satisfaction, and happiness.
It transforms into melatonin at night, controlling our daily rhythm to keep us healthy by producing enough sleep hormones which make us experience REM in the deep levels of sleep.

 
No more stress
After surveying 3,000 Americans, 65% of them said they are stressed out and 70% of them have reported that their stress is caused by economic and daily life crises due to COVID-19.
Sleep I Mask reduces cortisol production by stimulating the cerebral nerves through CES technology, which is proven to lower stress levels.

Don't wait, please start body conditioning today!
 
Let's focus!Sleeping problems exacerbate concentration and work inefficiency. Sleep I Mask helps you get a full night’s rest, which in so doing, improves your power of concentration.
It’s great for athletes and students as it accelerates performance in the field of study or sport!
We sincerely guarantee that your life will never be the same with the Sleep I Mask.

  Strengthen your immune systemDo you get tired easily? Do you experience fatigue? Then you need to experience the power of deep sleep.
Deep sleep doesn’t work only for sleep problems like insomnia.
It increases helper T cells and NK cells which are immunocytes.
As a result, a full night's rest helps with high blood pressure and cardiac disorders caused by insomnia, and at the same time, it improves your immune system.

  You can't miss this too!Have you ever experienced skin breakouts due to lack of sleep? Now you can take control of your breakouts!
It is unavoidable. You will have a decrease in collagen and moisture if you do not get enough sleep.
Sleep I Mask, which uses CES technology, sends micro-currents into the cells to activate protein synthesis. It also increases oxygen transmission by a rate of 40%.
Recover your skin's health through fluent protein synthesis and moisturize your skin with a healthy amount of oxygen transmission.

  Anytime, anywhereSleep I Mask is small and portable, so it's great for at-home use or for on the go! You can just wear it while you're watching TV, washing dishes, or even when you're sitting on the couch, doing nothing.
Do you go on a lot of business trips and need to adapt to the time difference? Or are you too sensitive to escape your own bed?
Do not hesitate to take the Sleep I Mask wherever you go because it is compact and handy but still powerful enough to help you overcome the effects of jet-lag
All you need to do is just bring it along and wear it. You'll find yourself feeling refreshed and rejuvenated the next day.

 

CES (Cranial Electric Stimulation) is a type of brain stimulation. This brain electro-stimulation changes the functions of your cranial nervous system by using the same amount of energy that is used in electric or magnetic fields. 
This stimulation leads to changes in brainwaves and the amount of hormones produced.
CES transmits weak alternating currents destined for the brain passing through electrodes situated in the ear canal, maxillary larynx junction, mastoid, and temple. Next, CES affects the brain synapse hormone production by participating in the limbic system, reticular activating system, and hypothalamus.
It is observed that the amount of brain synapse hormones such as serotonin, beta-endorphin, and melatonin increases after CES therapy.
These hormones are deeply connected with the ability to control emotion and sleeping problems, and it is proven to be effective for sleeping difficulties, especially when the amount of serotonin and melatonin increases.
Aside from this astonishing impact, CES reduces existing cortisol in the blood and positively changes the brainwaves.

Two electric poles are used to send electric stimuli to your brain which produce melatonin and serotonin; these help you to fall asleep. (Gilla, 2004)
This electricity is harmless and is already naturally produced by the brain. It also reduces cortisol levels which means less stress. This helps improve your immune system which can, in turn, prevent other illnesses.
The credibility of CES is validated through the change of cranial nerves confirmed by f-MRIs.
CES technology is clinically proven and approved by the FDA.

Whether you're using elevator buttons, ATM machines, or simply pulling open doors, you're more likely to contact bacteria and viruses since these are all shared surfaces.  Introducing Shield20The gadget that will change the way you use shared surfaces. Shield20 is made from a solid piece of brass which is inherently antimicrobial, to help decrease the spreading of germs while performing some of your everyday tasks. In addition to its compact and versatile design Shield is the first product in the market that offers double protection which is an individual case, in order to avoid contact with other surfaces after using it. And the inside part is made from cotton to spray it with sterilizer and keep your Shield20 sterilized inside the case to not transform the bacterias.Did you Know:The typical office worker comes in to contact with 10 million bacteria per day.  Doorknob for example, is not only touched by a large number of people, making the virus or bacteria transmission even easier, but also can keep up to 5 days.Scary, right?What if you can open the doors, turn on the light, use the elevator and ATM, and do even more things without touching them directly?The amount of germs on the average elevator button is  40 times more than that of a public toilet, with a massive 313 “colony-forming units” on a single square centimeter.The sink may actually be the dirtiest place you ever use. There are typically 600.000 bacterias per square inch. The lifespan of COVID-19 on sinks is 2 to 3 days.ATM buttons are hotbeds for two types of bacteria called bacillus and pseudomonas, which are known to cause gastrointestinal diseases and diarrhea.     What’s more? The keyring offers a number of options to keep Shield 20 conveniently near you at all times. Attach it to your backpack, bag, belt, keys, or wallet and you are ready to go.Being made of brass and located in its individual leather case Shield20 makes it easier to perform a number of actions without direct hand contactWith a goal to avoid virus transmission and preserve health, thoroughly designed Shield 20 is developed and ready to be introduced to the public Risks & ChallengesWe know exactly what we need to get this project across the finish line. The only thing we lack is funding. We don’t foresee any other major risks referring to the production after reaching our goal.Although Shield20 is production-ready, the COVID-19 crisis is still going on. In these turbulent times a lot of factories are closed in many countries. Fortunately, we have managed to make arrangements with a few suppliers, who are ready to provide us with all the materials necessary to start the production of Shield 20 after the end of the campaign.We highly appreciate your support, as due to it we will be able to create a safer world.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About my involvement with Kendo</h3>
<p>I began Kendo, the way of the sword, in Toronto, Canada at the JCCC - the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre - when I was around 20 years old. I practised back then for about four years and then stopped for another five or so years before coming back to it again. Now 61, Kendo continues to be a major part of my life and, in many ways, defines it. I love Kendo.</p>
<p>I now live in Thailand in a small forested village in the mountains that lie to the east of Chiang Mai in the north of the country. I practise at a dojo called Lanna Kendo in Chiang Mai. Lanna Kendo is a part of an orphanage run for many years now by a wonderful Korean charitable organisation and most of those that practise Kendo there are children from the orphanage.  Others outside of the organisation, both Thai and foreigners, come out to practice now and then as well. For myself, I try to get into the dojo once a week, on Fridays, where I will often lead/teach the session. Anyone, who knows Kendo will also know that this is all about volunteering. I will add a wonderful short article that Rico Kanthatham wrote about Lanna Kendo at the bottom of my blurb here. He describes the spirit of the place and people so well.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561039539/mtwdikyg4q8qkwaw18gk.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Teaching Kendo involves much more than simply imparting technical knowledge to the students. It connects with how a person lives a life, how we can build tenacity and strength to prepare for when the hardships of life inevitably arrive upon us. Noguchi Takashi Sensei in the video that I have linked at the bottom of this, says it quite perfectly: “First of all I think that I have to work hard and develop as a person, rather than just telling the students what to do. I believe that I should be working hard to earn the right to teach them."" Those words and the other aspects that he talks about in the video truly embodies the spirit of Kendo and is what I try to follow myself. </p>
<p>Besides all of this, it is simply time for me to challenge myself to the next level, to improve on both a physical level and on the deeper conceptual aspects inherent in the art of Kendo.</p>
<p>In Kendo, there are ten kyu grades  - what in other martial arts are often indicated by coloured belts - and then eight dan grades - again more commonly understood, in other arts, as black belt levels. In Kendo, we wear no visible indication of what our individual level is. This, I like. </p>
<p>This year, I will be challenging for 4th dan.</p>
<div>
<div>
<h3>The fundraising </h3>
<p>The minimum amount that I'm hoping to raise with this fundraiser, $500 CAD, will cover transportation both to, from and within Bangkok, the grading fees and food. That's about it. I will likely crash at a friend's place so I won't need to raise any funds for accommodation.</p>
<p>All funds raised will go towards the grading in August. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As Kendoka, grading is an important aspect of our life in Kendo. It is an essential aspect of our own physical, mental and spiritual development. There is also a kind of continuity to this, being a part of a group, a community, common goals connected with working our way through the levels as years go by.</p>
<p>One could say that, in a wide view, there are three aspects to Kendo practice: regular daily practice/keiko Kendo, competition/shiai Kendo, and grading Kendo. All are important. In each of those aspects, our focus and concentration can demand different elements within it and, as one might expect, all three help build each other.</p>
<p>My own personal improvement that comes with grading is, naturally, good for me, but it is also, I believe, good for the dojo where I practise and the wonderful people there with whom I practise. In Kendo, we are there to help each other and though someone of a higher level may act as leader or teacher, it is also commonly understood that all learn from all, no matter what the level.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ok, so... Indiegogo suggests talking about risks and challenges. Well, there are definitely challenges, mostly connected with the fact that the higher up one goes in Kendo the more complete and sure one's Kendo must be as well as a deepening understanding of what is called Seme amongst other concepts. </p>
<p>Because of the increased demands placed upon ourselves as we improve and rise in the ranks, there is also the chance (that would be your ‘risk’ bit)  that I will not pass and will have to try again. Fall down nine times, get up nine times is how that one goes.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I hope it goes without saying that donations of any and all amounts will be deeply appreciated and made well use of. If you would like to help in other ways, you could pass this campaign around on social media, let friends know etc. That could help a lot. :-) </p>
<p>Thanks so much for having a look at this and I truly hope this finds all well and happy.</p>

<p>...and here is the article about Lanna Kendo by Rico<br/><strong>Lanna Kendo Club </strong>By Rico Kanthatham<br/>Lanna Kendo club is located at World cup land, near Grace’s International School. This club belongs to a Korean Orphanage foundation.<br/>The Orphans children practice kendo every week, (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). In Kendo usually, if there is no teacher, the higher grade teach the younger.<br/>The higher student is called “先輩 Senpai” and “後輩Kōhai” for the junior.</p>
<p>The Korean foundation looks after the Orphanage in an amazing way. All children and teenager, go to school and University. Their dormitory has a very warm atmosphere. Although they are learning at school, when they go back to the Orphanage they share the housework, such as cleaning and cooking for all of them, do their homework and they practice kendo.<br/><br/>Volunteers from abroad teach them different topics, like English and Korean languages.<br/>Mr Kwon, the Father who is in charge, allow them to learn the coffee waiter job. They did a coffee house which is called “Tripti Chiangmai ”</p>
<p>The Japanese martial art ‘Kendo’, the way of the sword, is not widely known or well understood by non-Japanese. At least that is what one would think or tend to believe. It does not have the global recognition of ‘Karate’, another of Japan’s martial arts. In comparison to Karate, Kendo does not seem practical in the modern world, as few people walk around with swords or make use of them in daily life.<br/>But in Chiang Mai, Thailand, thousands of kilometers away from Japan, the esoteric martial art of Kendo has become integral to the lives and upbringing of a group of amazing Thai children. At the Grace Home orphanage (Lanna Kendo), a group of 20 or so young boys and girls ranging from about 8 to 18 years of age regularly practice Kendo. Introduced to them by their former headmaster of the orphanage, a Japanese missionary, the Grace Home children have not only embraced but excelled at the martial art. They have not only become proficient at the techniques of kendo, but have also absorbed and exude the spirit of Kendo. I have had the privilege to practice Kendo with these children several times over the past few years. I have seen them grow and get strong, honing not only their technique but also their character. At the end of every practice session at the Lanna Kendo Club, the name they have given themselves, I always leave exhausted, exhilarated and inspired.</p>
<p>From these children, I have learned that the Kendo does have relevance in the modern world, that it more than a Japanese martial art. Kendo is relevant in modern society not because it provides the practitioner with physical exercise and sword fighting skills, but because it provides the practitioner with the means to refine one’s character. Kendo is difficult, physically demanding and can sometimes be painful. To succeed and progress, the practitioner must persist, endure and seek to improve. And as a full-contact, full-speed martial art that can only be effectively learned through matches with sparring partners, the practitioner must not only how to win while suppressing ego but lose with gratitude. Maintaining a friendly, supportive atmosphere within the practice hall, the dojo, is vital. Decorum, respect for others and self-discipline as also required characteristics of a Kendo practitioner. Kendo, therefore, not only teaches fighting skills but also life skills.<br/>In many ways, the Grace Home children are no different than any other kids their age. They laugh and play and have the youthful energy of any child or teenager. But when one sees these same children in their Kendo gear and practising, it becomes clear that they possess something their peers do not have. In the dojo, they show a level of self-discipline and focus, a maturity and refinement of character that is beyond their years. I would like to believe that it was Kendo that is honing them to be such fine young adults. I very much look forward to the next time I am in Chiang Mai, in my Kendo gear, ready to receive another life lesson at the Lanna Kendo Club.</p>

<p>My mom is an immensely strong and brave individual. She suffers from a rare neurological disorder called Reflux Sympathic Dystrophy, or RSD which causes her body to have a chronic burning fire sensation.</p>

<li>Severe pain in your throat when you swallow food or drinks?</li>
<li>Having pain from water in the shower, or the wind on your skin?</li>
<li>Being unable to be touched or hugged by your husband or your child?</li>
</ul><p>This is an everyday reality than my mother has been enduring for the better part of her life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Living with RSD: A Prisoner In My Own Skin.. </strong></p>
<p>When my mom was 16 she was trapped in the basement when a fire broke out. Gathering strength, she walked up the stairs, here bare feet began melting into each step. She sustained 3rd degree burns over 45 percent of her body and underwent multiple skin grafts while conscious where her skin was literally ripped from her tissues to prevent infection multiple times per for a three month duration. Even after the horrors of the burn unit, it would not compare to the many years of living with RSD.</p>
<p>As the years progressed, so did the pain. Every year she faced increasing pain that further disrupted her daily life. It started off only allowing her the use of her feet for limited hours during the day.  My mother was a meticulous and caring housewife who loved every minute of taking care of her family. She made dinner every night, picked us up from school, and participated in all of our extra-curricular activities when her RSD was in its beginning stages. Only later in my life did I learn that it was all at a cost. She would often crawl up the stairs to her bedroom just from standing at the stove and making us dinner. In 2003, her RSD progressed after breaking part of her foot.  She stopped making dinner. We began walking home from school. She could no longer take us to the zoo or to the park. She stopped attending church. She stopped her passion of gardening. If she did any of these things she would pay for it dearly.</p>
<p>Right now her body is internally engulfed in flames. Her body literally feels like it is on fire. There is not one second of the day that she is not experiencing pain. For a woman who has had such a traumatic life and chronic pain from the age of 16 to 50, she is in desperate need of relief. Please help us ""put the fire out"".</p>
<p>RSD is also known as ""the suicide disease"" because the pain is so severe that patients feel they have no way out. Because of her hopelessness and torture my mom has actively considered this option. For those who do not personally know the horrors of RSD, this may seem extreme. As a daughter who has lived with and cared for an RSD victim in such despair, I can almost understand this drastic measure. Help my mom so that she has the option of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>No Help?... </strong></p>
<p>We have been through several pain management doctors, neurologists, and the Chronic Pain Program at the Cleveland Clinic,  who have not been willing to help my mom. Many physicians beleive that RSD is ""in your head"" which makes treatment for this RARE condition all that much harder. Researchers of RSD have concluded otherwise stating that patients should be medicated and treated for their respective symptoms. She has also had nerve blocks and steroid injections that quit having an effect on her about six years ago.</p>
<p>In addition to the financial strain of $300,000 in medical bills, our house is in the final stages of foreclosure which makes our struggle all the more difficult.</p>

<p><strong>A Caring Heart...</strong></p>
<p>My mom is one of the most selfless people I have ever met. She has always been there to care for those in need including three years spent with her mother, a stage-3 cancer patient, all while raising toddlers. When her father-in-law experienced a heart attack she drove to New York to pick him up and bring him to our home where she took care of him for almost 2 years. She was a mentor to children in need at our Elementary School and served as a Cooperative Team Parent, getting awards for her services. She even served the elderly neighbors in our community. All in all, she is the type of person that has spent her life caring for everyone else but herself.</p>

<h2><strong>Ketamine Infusion : A chance at Life...</strong></h2>
<p>My mom has been accepted for a 3 month Ketamine Infusion in New Jersey under Dr. Getson. This procedure will help to reset her nervous system. The Ketamine will essentially block the pain from entering her nerves in hopes of allowing her nervous system to ""reset"" and function properly.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is that the Ketamine treatment is not covered by insurance because it is considered to be experimental.</p>
<p>The infusion protocol is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 hours a day, 5 days a week for 2 weeks.</li>
<li>4 hours a day, 2 days a week for 4 weeks.</li>
<li>4 hours a day, 1 day a week for 4 weeks.</li>
<li>4 hours a day, 1 day every other week for 4 weeks.</li>
</ul><p>The total cost of the treatment for the three month duration is $50,000 dollars + Tax totaling $54,500. This does not include hotel, traveling, or food for myself and my mom. After the initial 3 month treatment, we will still need to go back to New Jersey for $1,500 - $1,800 booster treatments throughout my mother’s life. There is also a 4% fee taken from all donations for indiegogo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you could do...</strong></p>
<p>I want to thank you for taking the time to read about my mothers battle with RSD. The Ketamine Treatment is the only hope for my mothers future. Her life depends on your generosity which can be as little as a $5 donation. As I have said the total cost is roughly $55,000 for the treatment plus the additional cost of boosters. It's sad that my mothers very life rests on money but is the reality of the situation. I hope that this story touches your heart, I know that every donation will touch mine.</p>

<p><strong>A note from Ashley...</strong></p>
<p>As her daughter, I have watched the horror thas has become her life. It has affected our family to its core. We have not able to experience ""normal"" family life from my earliest memory. She can't embrace her grandchild, or take him to the park. She missed my prom and graduation because she could not handle the pain it took to get out of bed. She can no longer wear most clothing because contact with her skin sets of the burning. She can't walk to the bathroom unassisted, or bathe herself alone. I  watch her struggle to drink a cup of tea, and it hurts my heart. I pray that my mother will be fortunate enough to recieve this treatment so that she can be around to see my wedding, and be there when I have my first child, but mostly so that she can have a chance at life, something she has never had. She has always been their for all of us in our hour of need, and it is my turn to be there for her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you again! I love you all!</p>

I  watch her struggle to drink a cup of tea, and it hurts my heart. I pray that my mother will be fortunate enough to recieve this treatment so that she can be around to see my wedding, and be there when I have my first child, but mostly so that she can have a chance at life, something she has never had. She has always been their for all of us in our hour of need, and it is my turn to be there for her.

<h3>There has already been one miracle, now let’s make another one happen for Rick and Debbie.</h3>
<p>Rick and Debbie are my sister and brother in law.  I am trying to raise money for them to help pay Rick's medical bills and help ease the financial burden this has placed on the family. </p>
<p>Rick and Debbie first met 30 years ago.  They met again just over a year ago and were married June 3, 2011.  Both said they had never been happier in their life and you could see the love between them.  </p>
<p>Sounds like a fairy tale love story right?  It was until Sunday April 1, when Rick complained of not being able to move his legs. They went to the emergency room and Rick was immediately admitted.  The next morning he underwent surgery for blood clots in his legs.  I received a call from Debbie letting me know Rick was in surgery.  She was crying and told me “I finally found the love of my life and I’m so afraid I’m going to lose him”.  The next day things were much brighter.  Rick had undergone four surgeries to remove the clots and would be released from the hospital the next morning.  </p>
<p>As Debbie prepared for his dismissal, Rick started talking gibberish and flaying around in the bed.  While the nurses were trying to settle Rick down, he turned blue in the face and fell back.  They immediately started CPR.  Rick had suffered a stroke.  There was bleeding in the brain near the stem cell which was inoperable.  He was taken into surgery again to drain the fluid and blood building around the brain and was put in ICU on life support and a medically induced coma.  He had several more surgeries that April, inserting the shunt, inserting and then removing the feeding tube, reinserting a permanent shunt for brain drainage.  He then developed clots in his arm and leg.  Blood thinners thinned his blood too much and doing nothing produced more clots.  They were working on finding a happy medium.  </p>
<p>Rick was in a coma for much of his hospital stay so was unaware of everything happening to and around him.  Debbie stayed by his side leaving the hospital only 2 nights in the 2 ½ months following his initial visit to the emergency room that Sunday in April.  Co-workers donated some of their vacation time and Debbie took all of her vacation time but still it wasn’t enough for his lengthy stay.  So, she would leave the hospital go to work, come back at lunch and then return after her workday to be by his side. </p>
<p> Rick and Debbie celebrated their first wedding anniversary in the hospital.  On June 16, Rick was finally able to return home!  He doesn’t remember anything about the hospital stay.  He has trouble walking without help, has problems with dizziness due to the stroke and has a permanent shunt in his brain to continue draining the fluid. He is now doing out-patient therapy.  </p>
<p> Because Rick was a massage therapist he has been unable to return to work.  His arms and hands aren’t strong enough now and the dizziness is doubled trying to move around the table.  They are completely relying on Debbie’s small income.</p>
<p> Please help give Rick and Debbie’s love story a happy ending by contributing to help pay the enormous medical bills and Rick’s continued care.</p>
<p>I understand times are difficult for everyone now  but I ask that you  contribute whatever you can.  No amount is too small.</p>
<p> Thank you for your generosity and support.  Together we can make another miracle happen!</p>

<p>After a series of health issues over the years, numerous doctor visits, all kinds of diagnoses culminating in meningitis in 2009, a fast progression downhill lead me to be tested for Lyme disease.  My blood tests came back ragingly positive across the board. I was diagnosed with Chronic Lyme disease and its co-infections in October of 2011</p>
<p>After 6 months of standard oral antibiotic treatment I went to DC in March to investigate further with a specialist in Washington DC. I felt like I was slipping.  New symptoms were happening.  Seizures, legs giving out, periods of total dementia, dropping anything from my coffee to jars of food to my hands and fingers going numb, insomnia, violent mood swings and rages, deep depression, hallucinations, memory loss, both short term and long term.  There are entire periods of my life I cannot remember.  Stuttering, speech loss, the list goes on.  </p>
<p>The results showed I am in the late stages of Neurological Lyme Disease.  My particular case involves manifestations of the brain, central nervous system and possibly kidneys and digestive system.  My immune system is completely gone.  I may have this for the rest of my life but I am fighting for total eradication of the parasite of possible.   Lyme Disease is deadly, it invades and destroys all facets of the human body until if untreated it can kill you.</p>
<p>Extensive long-term I.V. therapy treatments are required for me.  While working with the specialist in DC he found that I also have a gene disorder: MTHFR C677t:  <a href=""http://mthfr.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mthfr.net</a> with my particular strand I cannot process foliate or b vitamins which are needed in many cases to help absorb oral antibiotics into the cells and into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Therefore, Oral medication protocol will not work at eradicating or even keeping parts of the infection at bay.</p>
<p>I have been working with neurologists and neurospych specialists locally.  Tests show (per the specialists) that I am presenting with ""long term effects of an invasive infectious disease"".  My I.Q. has dropped; my mental and occupational processing skills have been reduced (so far) from that of of a 38 year old by 49% (I don't know what age range that is).  My eyes do not dilate. I don't recognize certain shapes and have become ""temporarily dyslexic"".</p>
<p>IV Protocol is more expensive, however it is the only way I can beat this and survive.  I can only get the stronger IV protocol with my D.C. specialist.  I have gone as far as I can with my local doctor. Otherwise I am facing a slow and steady deterioration more than likely towards a terminal outcome since this is chewing away at my brain and my Central Nervous System.</p>
<p>Insurance is supposed to cover 28 days of Lyme treatment.  We have received nothing but denials.  So far we have had 2 appeals denied.  So in fact, insurance has covered nothing.</p>
<p><strong>What Your Contribution Provides</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your contribution provides the following:</strong></p>
<p>Money for the stronger I.V. antibiotic treatment</p>
<p>Travel to and from DC for regular check-up appointments</p>
<p>Accommodations and food in DC during regular check ups</p>
<p>Supplies to administer the IV antibiotics</p>
<p>Help towards existing mounting medical bills due to insurance denying coverage</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you can't help financially, you can spread the word!  This is not only my fight, people need to know what the insurance industries are doing, or not doing, with a disease that is so deadly.  Every penny counts, but so does getting the word out!!</p>
<p>I am looking at this as a fresh start to life, if all goes well, not a personal tragedy.  There are lessons to be learned from this, some of them have been hard, but I am taking this journey with the hope that I learn and gain the experience I am supposed to, and rise from it so I can help others once I am better.  That is why even if you cannot contribute, please pass this forward.</p>

<h3>who are we</h3>
<p>My name is Elizabeth Heller and I am the Manager of my fiancee Lawrence Hardesty.  Lawrence has a life long dream of being a motocross racer and up until recently thought his age was a factor and that he would not be able to accomplish this dream.  With support and encouragement from myself and family, we began this journey together.  </p>
<h3>our story</h3>
</div>
<p>We have purchased most of his gear and all that is needed is two major protectors for his safety.  The body armor and the neck protector.  In September 2012 we ordered his first bike, which is an Apollo125cc.  We thought it was going to be a full-size bike but found out upon delivery and hours of assembly that it is infact a pit-bike. Upon calling the sales person that handled our order we found out that there was no way they would take this bike back. All sales final. EVEN after the fact that we specifically told them what we needed this bike for and Lawrences height and weight, we were told this was the perfect beginner bike for someone starting out in racing. Dont get us wrong, Lawrence does love this bike and had decided to participate in mini motos until we could come up with the funds for a full-size bike. However, we have recently found out that on the east coast there is no specific classes for pit-bikes. According to the AMA (American Motorcyclists Association), promoters do hold pit-bike races but there is not many that are held in New York State or on the East Coast.  Pit-bike racing is major on the West Coast. We also found out that he can race in the over 30 class on AMA sponsored tracks, but he would be at a great disadvantage. With me being on SSD and him on SSI any extra income to front for expenses has been very difficult. We can afford to make payments on a bike but cannot find anyone to finance us due to past credit history problems. </p>
<h3>with determination we were led here</h3>
<p>It saddens me to watch my husband-to-be deal with constant frustration and let down and almost giving up on his dreams because of a sales person more focused on the sale then actually providing the consumer what they were in specific search for. His determination and passion for Motocross racing is very inspiring.  He means the world to me and I will do all I can do to help him succeed in this endeavor.  Nothing will stop us, I wont allow it. An aquaintence of mine through facebook steered me in the direction of this site for help in raising the money for what is needed to get this talented, dedicated racer off his feet and to the starting gate.</p>
<h3>what we need and why</h3>
<p>In the photos you will see the logo i personally designed for Lawrence for the racing team that we created for him to race under as a privateer racer to start out.We are trying to raise $4000 dollars to help offset cost for the rest of his protective gear and a fullsize bike.  Any funds raised over $4000 will help offset travel expenses for the races and any entry fees associated with the events. We have offered a wide-range of perks for you to choose from and are very excited about this campaign. If anyone is unable to help support this campaign, we ask that you share it with your friends, families, neighbors, employers or anyone else you can think of that might be willing to help.  We appreciate any and all support that is able to be given.</p></div>","who are we

<h2><strong><span>Finally! The worlds first compact, lightweight and easy to use temporary floatation device available at wholesale!</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Floatm8<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>has designed this very cool and trendy patented temporary floatation device.  One of the many advantage’s with Floatm8 is that you can take Floatm8 anywhere with you, to the beach, on a boat, surfing, canoeing, rockfishing, paddle boarding, swimming, fishing, camping or any other water activity or water sport where there is a element of risk.</span></p>
<p><span>Floatm8 is a specifically designed personal floatation device that is worn around the waist. The activation unit containing the miniature gas cylinder with the inflatable bladder is attached to a elastic lanyard which can be moved around the waist providing unobtrusive use in most water based activities. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Activation</strong></h2>
<p><span>Activating Floatm8 is a simple process:</span></p>
<p><strong>1. Grasp the unit around the waist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Press the firing button on top of the unit which releases the inert gas,</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. In 10-15 seconds the wearer has instant floatation. </strong></p>
<p>This will allow the wearer to be either rescued or move into calmer water conditions. It's that simple!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/816826/pictures/original/20130518015251-Foatmate_flotation_device-7.jpg?1368867170"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Floatm8</strong> is a single use, gas driven temporary floatation device. It is sleek in design, lightweight, compact and easy to use. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/816810/pictures/original/20130518011519-Foatmate_flotation_device-2-2.jpg?1368864918"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>When Floatm8 is activated the bladder is inflated to the aproxamate size of a soccor ball which is an ideal size to sustain buyoncey. The wearer can then put their arms around the bladder, this will allow better stability in the water and give the wearer a feeling of calmness until being assisted or moving into calmer waters.</p>
<p>Once used Floatm8 can be easily removed from around the waist, Pop the bladder and simply dispose of accordingly.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">    <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/845247/pictures/original/20130601220516-mail_3_.jpg?1370149515"" src="""" style=""""/><strong>   <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/845245/pictures/original/20130601220125-mail_5_.jpg?1370149284"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>We conducted trials with the Australian Surf Life Saving Association and we were able to test and prove that Floatm8 was able to maintain the buoyancy of a test person weighing over 220 lbs (100 Kgs) which was a great result for us. </p>

<div> </div></div>","Finally! The worlds first compact, lightweight and easy to use temporary floatation device available at wholesale!
Floatm8 has designed this very cool and trendy patented temporary floatation device.  One of the many advantage’s with Floatm8 is that you can take Floatm8 anywhere with you, to the beach, on a boat, surfing, canoeing, rockfishing, paddle boarding, swimming, fishing, camping or any other water activity or water sport where there is a element of risk.
Floatm8 is a specifically designed personal floatation device that is worn around the waist. The activation unit containing the miniature gas cylinder with the inflatable bladder is attached to a elastic lanyard which can be moved around the waist providing unobtrusive use in most water based activities. 
Activation
Activating Floatm8 is a simple process:
1. Grasp the unit around the waist.
2. Press the firing button on top of the unit which releases the inert gas,
3. In 10-15 seconds the wearer has instant floatation. 
This will allow the wearer to be either rescued or move into calmer water conditions. It's that simple!
 

Floatm8 is a single use, gas driven temporary floatation device. It is sleek in design, lightweight, compact and easy to use. 

Worn Comfortably at the back.

or on the side

 
When Floatm8 is activated the bladder is inflated to the aproxamate size of a soccor ball which is an ideal size to sustain buyoncey. The wearer can then put their arms around the bladder, this will allow better stability in the water and give the wearer a feeling of calmness until being assisted or moving into calmer waters.
Once used Floatm8 can be easily removed from around the waist, Pop the bladder and simply dispose of accordingly.
       
We conducted trials with the Australian Surf Life Saving Association and we were able to test and prove that Floatm8 was able to maintain the buoyancy of a test person weighing over 220 lbs (100 Kgs) which was a great result for us. 
 
 ****We believe anyone taking part in any water activity where there is an element of risk should be wearing Floatm8.**** 


What also gives Floatm8 the leading edge in temporary floatation devices is that there is nothing in the global market place today that is comparative in design and affordability.

Small Beginnings...
This was our first production line..I suppose you have to start somewhere.
 
   
 
Manufacturing - Once we complete our Indiegogo campaign we will look at commencing production on our first order of Floatm8 units.  The production will initially be conducted in China. We have engaged a successful production factory which will be able initially produce aprox 10,000 units per month, with capacity to deliver up to 100,000 per month.
 When the first production run is completed we will immediately ship the Floatm8 units out to our backers and supporters. We anticipate that this manufacturing process should take around 30-35 days from the day we start manufacturing.
Floatm8 will continue to explore and identify opportunities to sell large volume to commercial wholesale retail outlets. These opportunities are dependent on the ability to manufacture the required volume and have the capital to rapidly expand the business.
To achieve this we will engage various channels for distribution. 
These will include: • Internet  • Local, national and international distributors • Major retailers in various industry and consumer areas. • Large transport organizations – air, sea and aquatic  • Various media based sales organizations • Surf Lifesaving of Australia   Viral Marketing - 'Please help us spread the word'
Floatm8 is a product that has been well researched and developed by us it has a unique place in the floatation market,  and most importantly will be available to everybody. 
The success of this project will depend heavily on your word of mouth and how the news is spread. Comments on every blog and social networking post count, so please share on Facebook, Twitter Google Plus and whever else possible.

<h1>A Note From Jess:</h1>
<p>Today's beauty care industry is one of the least regulated industries in our country.  The FDA does not review nor does it have the authority to regulate what goes into cosmetics and because of this, terms such as ""organic"" and ""natural"" are widely misused and misrepresented. In fact, 89% of the ingredients currently used in cosmetics have not even been evaluated by the FDA.</p>
<p>While attending Emerson College, I first started to seriously check out beauty product ingredients and began uncovering facts like I mentioned above--and I couldn't believe that I was finding these harmful ingredients in some of the products that even I was using!</p>
<p>That was the last straw.  At that moment, I realized i wasn't going to stand for the dishonesty and lack of clarity in our beauty industry and decided to do something about it! </p>
<p>I founded Olive Natural Beauty's 100% natural &amp; organic skin care line with the mission to provide a healthy, honest, and more effective way for people to care for what is most important--our selves and our skin!</p>

<h1><strong>Why Our Skin Needs Saving….</strong></h1>
<p>DID YOU KNOW that your skin is the largest organ in your body?</p>
<p>Your skin absorbs a part of almost anything it touches. Yet, many popular beauty care products contain harmful ingredients such as preservatives, synthetic fragrances, and dyes that are in fact directly damaging to your skin and body.</p>
<p>Of course most of us don’t <em>want</em> to use products containing hurtful ingredients, but I've found that many people are either unaware that their products contain harmful ingredients or are naïve to how damaging their products truly are.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of industry regulation, many brands that you see labeled as “organic” and “natural” are in reality anything but. This is why Olive Natural Beauty is on a mission to SAVE OUR SKIN!</p>

<h1><strong>What Is Olive Natural Beauty?</strong></h1>
<p>Olive Natural Beauty products focus on the incredible benefits of pure Italian extra virgin olive oil for the skin. High in vitamin A, B, C, D, E, K, and iron, Olive Oil has been a Mediterranean secret of youth and beauty for ages. These vitamins, found in each Olive Natural Beauty product, help skin look younger by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while deflecting and neutralizing free radicals that attack skin's youthful appearance and cause up to 80% of visible aging.</p>
<p>Olive Natural Beauty only uses 100% organic extra virgin in all of our products. Rich in Linoleic and Oleic acids, (a deprivation of which is a main cause of dry skin) extra virgin olive oil (or EVOO) is the least processed, purest, and most beneficial form of olive oil on the planet.</p>

Please, we need the funds by next month to quickly pay for and therefore cure Thuc's melanoma.
Our family is in a state of crisis, we cannot offer much, and it would be insulting to show what we could. However we and Thuc thank you deeply for helping.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of individuals brought together through our fraternity and we are here for one reason: to support the brothers of our organization. Yesterday we were informed that one of our active brothers, a transgender female to male, was denied the opportunity to recieve financial support from his insurance for top surgery.</p>
<p><strong>We are now trying to raise that money for him. We are doing this as individuals in an organization rallying around another individual. This endeavor is not being sponsored by the organization as a whole, rather the active members within it. </strong></p>
<p>We care deeply about each and everyone, and rely on the entire active brotherhood to stand behind any one individual when they are in need.   </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our brother's top surgery is already scheduled for <strong>May 2013.</strong> This money would allow him to keep that appointment, and would cover what his insurance did not. </p>
<p>We as an organization are told from day one to use our resources. You may not know this gentleman like we do, and we might not even know you, but if it speaks to you then we want to present you with an opportunity to give. </p>
<p>We would much rather recieve $10 from 100 people than recieve $100 from 10 people. </p>
<p><strong>We are here less to raise money, and more to tell a story. </strong>The story of transformation, and story of self-discovery, and the story of brotherhood. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is small. But it is meaningful. If you are on this page, it is most likely because an active brother has reached out to you. If you stumbled upon this page, even better. We want this to be a conversation, rather than a donation. Please don't hesitate to communicate with us. </p>

<p>I will be traveling from May 14-May 20, 2013 to Honduras. I will be alongside about 20 other students from Emory University to work alongside professional dentists to give free clinical care and teach preventative care to the Honduran community.</p>
<p>I will be graduating from the Emory University May 2013 with a major in Neuroscience and behavioral biology and a minor in Spanish.</p>
<p>Traveling to Spanish-speaking countries has always been a passion of mine. I have been learning Spanish from the age of 11 and had the opportunity to travel to Spain by myself and work in a Mexican restaurant in my hometown for extra practice. With my passion for Spanish, I am also passionate about my future endeavor, to be a dentist. </p>
<p>College has been a confusing journey, as I am sure it is for many other students as well, and I learned that having healthy teeth is more than a great first impression or being complimented on a great smile. Having healthy teeth means longevity of life, confidence, and happiness. Having healthy teeth means that you physically are in good health, which is something that many individuals fail to recognize.</p>
<p>This is the breakdown for the cost of the trip:<br/>Trip cost: $750<br/>Medical Supplies: $100<br/>Flight Cost: $700</p>
<p>Since this is something that I personally am passionate about I would like to fundraise on my own without the help of my parents. They've sacrificed so much for me during my four years at a private university and I want to reward their effort by showing them that they did an amazing job raising me and instilling within me the morals of a upstanding humanitarian and Christian. </p>
<p>Any donation is extremely helpful and I hope that through this it will further my passion in becoming a dentist as I apply to dental school this summer. I am so excited to travel to Central America, it being my first time, and experiencing and indulging in a culture completely different than my own.</p>
<p>Thank You and God Bless!</p>

<h2><strong>Her Story...</strong></h2>
<p>In March of 2012, Colleen was misdiagnosed with “severe migraines.” Her life was turned upside down. She started to experience vision problems, numbness, difficulty walking, lapses in speech and cognitive functioning, unexplained bruising, headaches, vomiting, and extreme fatigue. Eventually she started hearing voices. Something wasn’t right...this wasn’t just migraines. On June 22, 2012, Colleen was rushed to the ER in St. Petersburg, FL, and diagnosed with a life-threatening blood disorder called Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, or T.T.P.<br/><br/>T.T.P. has a 95% mortality rate if left untreated...she dodged a bullet. But T.T.P. is still shooting.<br/><br/>The only known and effective forms of treatment for T.T.P. are:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Plasmapheresis (also called Plasma Exchange, a process somewhat similar to dialysis)</li>
<li>Prednisone (a steroid)</li>
<li>and Rituxin (a drug commonly used to fight blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma)</li>
</ul><p><br/>Colleen has received treatment, but she still has 3 more to go. Without them, she could face a severe relapse and she might not be as lucky...<br/><br/>She’s lost her job. There’s some question as to whether her insurance will cover this, and she can’t get treatment unless she pays out of pocket first. This campaign is to help Colleen fund her health...to keep her living.</p>
<h2><strong>Her Needs...</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The cost per treatment is $6,717.</strong> She needs these treatments once a week over the next three weeks or potentially longer. The chances of relapse are high and she can’t risk missing a treatment.</p>
<p>The total cost for treatment is $20,000 out of pocket.</p>

<p>$1 or $1,000, anything helps. All money raised will go to fund 100% of her treatment. Any overages from a successful funding will be donated to a non-profit charity of Colleen’s choice.</p>

healthier/cleaner alternative to what currently exist in the marketplace.  It is common practice that football players lay their helmets on the ground in between plays and during water breaks.  As a coach, I notice many dirty mouthpieces attached to helmets laying in the recently fertilized grass or dirt. Incidentally, a player's mouthpiece would get stepped on by another teammate by accident.  Unknowingly, the player
would put on his (her) helmet and the dirty mouthpiece back in his mouth. Nasty
huh!  No wondered half
of my team would be sick about a month into the season. The GNC mouthpiece allows the player to elevate it off the ground and out of the dirt.</span></font></font></p>

ten million kids playing contact sports every year. Therefore, I designed a
mouthpiece to give them all a healthier option.  The GNC patented, open ended finger-loop mouthpiece allows the players to clip it onto the face mask or  jersey collar rather than holding it in the palms of their dirty hands.  The GNC mouthpiece also gives the player the ability to
insert and remove the mouthpiece without placing dirty fingers in and out of their
mouth.  Staph and Strep are the two most commonly found viruses on the mouthpiece; with Staph becoming more and more resistant to medical drugs.  Every player on the field is required to wear a mouthpiece, and the finger-loop is clearly visible for referees
to easily see when their mouth is close.</span></font></font></p>

we raise on IndieGoGo will be used to fund the first GNC production rounds of the
mouthpiece.  The GNC mouthpiece
featured in our videos and images were made using prototype tooling, which has
been refined over the past year. 
In order to prepare for high quality and consistent production we need
to purchase several production tools, and prepare our production line, which has
significant upfront cost.

Grip-N-Clip came to be!
 
My name is Tony Wilson (Coach Wilson) the creator of the Grip-N-Clip (GNC) Mouthpiece.  Our GNC mouthpiece is designed to be a
healthier/cleaner alternative to what currently exist in the marketplace.  It is common practice that football players lay their helmets on the ground in between plays and during water breaks.  As a coach, I notice many dirty mouthpieces attached to helmets laying in the recently fertilized grass or dirt. Incidentally, a player's mouthpiece would get stepped on by another teammate by accident.  Unknowingly, the player
would put on his (her) helmet and the dirty mouthpiece back in his mouth. Nasty
huh!  No wondered half
of my team would be sick about a month into the season. The GNC mouthpiece allows the player to elevate it off the ground and out of the dirt.

 
Letâ€™s keep
it clean!
 
In the U.S., there are over
ten million kids playing contact sports every year. Therefore, I designed a
mouthpiece to give them all a healthier option.  The GNC patented, open ended finger-loop mouthpiece allows the players to clip it onto the face mask or  jersey collar rather than holding it in the palms of their dirty hands.  The GNC mouthpiece also gives the player the ability to
insert and remove the mouthpiece without placing dirty fingers in and out of their
mouth.  Staph and Strep are the two most commonly found viruses on the mouthpiece; with Staph becoming more and more resistant to medical drugs.  Every player on the field is required to wear a mouthpiece, and the finger-loop is clearly visible for referees
to easily see when their mouth is close.

 
Drop and
give me twenty, actually I need seventy-five!!!
 
The $7,500.00
we raise on IndieGoGo will be used to fund the first GNC production rounds of the
mouthpiece.  The GNC mouthpiece
featured in our videos and images were made using prototype tooling, which has
been refined over the past year. 
In order to prepare for high quality and consistent production we need
to purchase several production tools, and prepare our production line, which has
significant upfront cost. 
Sponsorships will allow us to mass produce large runs with the new
tooling and packaging in order to meet the high demand for the product.  In order to get to this point, I have exhausted all of my 401k
retirement.  I truly believe the GNC mouthpiece will help keep our athletes healthier during the sports season. Help me make this product available for our kids!

 
Whatâ€™s in
the bag?
 
Reward yourself, your coaches, your players with GNC mouthpiece and gear.  Many of you have kids, know kids and (or) adults that play contact sports and could benefit from the use of this product.  If you don't have kids playing, then be a sponsor by donating the
rewards to your local youth/school or adult league.  It is a fact that funding for youth sports have been severly cut
back, so any donation in products or goods given to a sports organizations would be greatly
appreciated.  Go ahead and make
a generous pledge to support both local youth and (or) adult leagues within your community with a much need product for a healthier season.  Go GRIP-N-CLIP!

 
A Team Effort!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<h3>My name is Julie Kaye and I would like to introduce you to ""Stress Less, Heal More"" which is  a program I designed to support people with the most serious health conditions based on my own experiences with breast cancer, grand mal seizures, brain surgery and Traumatic Brain Injury. </h3>
<div> I have had a brain condition in the stroke family called an AVM in the language area of my brain since I was a teenager. I would have Grand Mal seizures in the darndest of places like the community swimming pool, on a first date, or during my sleep and then not wake up for a few days, only to be fired at work for not showing up. I never told my bosses about my condition because they wouldn't have hired me and I just  figured that I would look for another job if I was fired. <br/>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>While having a health issue can be challenging, life can be much more difficult if you don't have a strong family/support system and endless supplies of money to get you through those periods. I haven't had family support and relied on strangers to get me to hospitals when I needed help. I had over $50,000 to live on with my brain surgery but quickly ran out of money to survive when complications occurred  after surgery and couldn't read or write let alone handle bills and finances. I was left with nothing to live on, and became a maid while my reading, writing and speech were being redeveloped. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have wondered many times, ""Could I be the only one without support going through a medical crisis, or are there others like me?""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My life's purpose/mission after all my experiences is to help people who don't have strong emotional support and enough financially to weather the storm during their own health crisis. What I know how to do best is to simplify life when life seems most complicated and lowering stress in your daily life is the first priority and finding support if you don't already have it. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My life now is very simple and basic almost monk-like in it's simplicity,  but stress is less than it used to be and therefore my health is better. My attitude is strong and positive and look forward to helping hundred's if not thousands of people get through their medical crisis.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>The most important impact we can have is to keep people in their homes and have enough money for food, medication and basic necessities of life. The second biggest impact is to let people know that we care about them and they are not alone in their plight. We will help them find what they need and often it's someone who will listen to them. </div><div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I have been working as a volunteer for a year helping people with cancer and in the early stages of working with people with a variety of other health conditions. I need to continue devoting my skills to this service full time, but there currently isn't  much funding available, so I would like to raise the money to cover my basic expenses so that not only can I continue to devote myself to it full time but can start training others to help people through their medical crises and to market my program so that it can reach more people in need. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We  work with individuals and organizations. Right now STRESS LESS, HEAL MORE is about to begin working with The Wounded Warrior Program and we have recently been added to the referral list for The Alzheimer's Association of San Diego. This is the tip of the iceberg for us!<br/><br/>

<p>                My name is Kate and I am 22 years old. I have had a very long and hard life. I have had two spinal surgeries due to severe scoliosis. Both surgeries were to save my life. I’m in such pain all the time, that most of the time I can barely walk. Once I turned 21, I was taken off of my Mother’s health insurance. My father, he left when I was a child. I have applied for medical assistance and SSI due to several other health issues. I have been denied both four times.</p>
<p>                Here is my problem. On July 7, 2012 I was rushed to the ER. I was having terrible pain in my thyroid. Now, I have Hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s Thyroid, so I thought nothing of it. I just thought it was something to do with them, my medication or the stress I was under at the time. After hours and hours of testing, doctors and medications for the pain, they called in their on call Endocrine to break the news to me. I have cancer.</p>
<p>                They have no idea how long I have had it because I have not been able to see a doctor for almost a year. The two tumors have moved my throat up and over. They are literally CRUSHING my vocal cords. One more test showed their and my worst nightmare; I am getting less than 40% oxygen at all times. With any activity (example: going up the stairs) it is reduced and putting tremendous stress on my lungs and heart.</p>
<p>                I am beyond desperate need for surgery. I have no money, no insurance and have been denied charity and state assistance. I have the doctors, the hospital and everything. They will not touch me without the money. I have fought for my life over and over again. This time I am going to fight even stronger; but I need YOUR help to do it. Please give what you can spare, even one dollar will help.</p>
<p>                After you donate; promise me you will send my link to every family member, friend and co-worker and mention it to someone you bump into at your local market. I am only 22 years old; I have a life left to live. I have a future to experience and a world to travel.</p>

<div>
<p>The prostate is a gland that is found only in males and is located below the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate produces a nourishing liquid that protects the sperm.</p>
<p>With age, the cells in the prostate gland often enlarge and cause urination difficulties. This is commonly known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is not the same as prostate cancer. BPH can often be helped through medications that help reduce the size of the prostate.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer most commonly occurs when there is a mutation of the cells found in the glandular regions of the prostate. Prostate cancer usually develops slowly.  There are multiple ways to treat prostate cancer, including expectant management, surgery (radical or robotic), radiation (external and internal), cryosurgery, hormone therapy and chemotherapy.</p>
<p>One of the main questions men ask prior to surgery is, “How will these treatment options affect my ability to have and maintain an erection?”  Anatomically, a delicate web of nerves surrounds the prostate and many forms of treatment can affect this nerve net. These nerves are responsible for relaying the signals that control erections. Damage to these nerves can cause permanent change and prevent the ability to achieve and maintain an erection.</p>
<p>Oral medication, including the three most commonly prescribed pills, has proven to be ineffective for helping erectile function after nerve damage from prostate cancer treatment. These oral medications rely on nerve signals to increase blood flow into the penis.  When these nerves can no longer conduct signals to cause an erection, the next step is providing information directly to the penis.</p>
<p>Don’t let prostate cancer treatments prevent you from having a great sex life. <span style=""color: #FF0000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;"">There are other medical treatments available.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ED can significantly effect your love life and indicate a decline in your cardiovascular health.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">According to a study done by the Australian National University, men with ED under the age of 55 are at risk of having heart disease, which makes sense because both the penis and your heart depend on healthy blood flow.</span></p>
<div>
<p>According to the project head, Emily Banks, “The risks of future heart disease and premature death increased steadily with severity of erectile dysfunction.” Men with severe ED and with no knowledge of having cardiovascular disease had a 35% chance to be hospitalized with an elevated 93% chance of mortality.</p>
<p>Based on these results, cardiovascular health director at Australia’s Heart Foundation stated, <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">“These results tell us that every man who is suffering from any degree of erectile dysfunction should be seeking medical assistance as early as possible and also insisting on a heart health check by their GP at the same time.”</span></p>
<p>What can be determined from this research is that it's important to be diagnosed and understand the severity of your erectile dysfunction and what implications it may have for your health.</p>

<p></p>There are at least two types of high blood pressure medications that can cause erectile dysfunction:<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Diuretics.  </strong>Also known as “water pills” and can reduce the amount of blood flow to the penis (which assists in maintaining a firmer erection).</li>
<li>
<strong>Beta Blockers. </strong>Affect the same area of the nervous system that is responsible for producing erections.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>Types of medication that do not affect sexual function are:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</li>
<li>Calcium channel blockers</li>
<li>Angiotensin II receptor blockers</li>
<li>Alpha blockers</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the Mayo Clinic and other sources, drinking in moderation may offer some health benefits.</p>
<p>Alcohol is often associated with social events and celebrations, and tends to be a social lubricant leading to flirtatious and confident conversations between the sexes. There's a reason why alcohol is called liquid courage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly known that when a man has too much to drink, he may have temporary erectile dysfunction (the inability to perform while being inebriated). Excessive drinking can lead to a hindrance of sexual desire and the inability to become sexually stimulated.</p>
<p>Occasional social drinking can be fun, but when it comes to consistent binge drinking, the story changes. Excessive drinking can lead to negative repercussions. According to O’Keefe and Hunt, up to 75% of patients in alcohol rehabilitation programs have erectile dysfunction. Chronic alcohol abusers’ erectile failure may be the result of a combination of psychogenic and organic factors (for example, neuropathy).</p>
<p>An individual, on average, has the ability to metabolize one drink per hour. When more than one hourly drink is consumed, toxin levels increase in the body and begin to affect different organs.</p>
<p>Consistent binge drinking and alcoholism can lead to organ failure, in this instance, the penis. It is important to keep in mind that alcohol can affect your health and to also remember to drink responsibly to avoid any negative repercussions.</p>

<p>Is your loss of interest due to ED or “Low T”?</p>
<p><b>Testosterone</b></p>
<p>Testosterone is a sex hormone produced mainly by the testicles. This hormone helps in the development of the testes and prostate, and also assists in increasing muscle mass, bone density, and the growth of body hair.</p>
<p>As men age the production of testosterone decreases; as the level declines, there may be a decrease in libido and an increase in lethargy. There could also be an increase of fat around the stomach and a drop in muscle definition. </p>
<p>A percentage of men who use testosterone hormone replacement therapy might notice a sense of well-being, plus a decrease in abdominal fat and greater muscle definition. Increasing testosterone levels may yield additional positive effects, including Osteoporosis prevention. While replacing testosterone may help increase libido, it does not have a direct effect on erectile function.</p>
<p><b>Erectile Dysfunction</b></p>
<p>The average man in his 50’s is likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction. For some men this begins in their late teens, for others in their 60’s. As men grow older, the penis does not trap blood properly. This results in a softening of the erection. This condition can be helped with numerous treatments.</p>
<p>For an erection to occur, multiple physical dynamics are involved. First, an increase in arterial blood must flow into the penis. Then, that increased volume of blood must be trapped causing the veins (that normally carry blood away from the penis) to get engorged. </p>
<p>The duration and strength of an erection are dependent upon the increased blood flow remaining in the penis. Age, medical conditions, medicines and lifestyle choices can affect the ability of the penis to receive and retain blood. This results in less firm erections or erectile dysfunction. </p>
<p>It is possible that your lack of interest is due to “low T”. It is also possible that <b>when your ED is treated your interest in intimacy will be renewed.</b><br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, erectile dysfunction will affect most men - this is simply a fact of life. It is nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed by. <span style=""color: #FF0000;"">But there are other medical treatments available</span>.</p>

FAQ's

 





Eventually, men may experience hair loss, greying, wrinkles and a need for glasses, a larger belt and blood pressure pills. Many men will also stumble out of bed to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. These are inevitable facts.
As a man's body ages, his penis ages too. In the majority of men, the penis will lose its vitality with age (including overall firmness, duration of the erection, staying power and possibly the ability to obtain an erection). As time goes on, pharmaceutical ED pills may have reduced functionality.
Diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), prostate issues and lifestyle choices (diet and smoking) may also affect the ability to obtain and maintain an erection.
The pills will often do the trick for a while, but they may have reduced functionality as time goes on. There are other medical treatments available.

 



All medication may cause side effects and not function as advertised. Viagra®, Cialis® and Levitra® pills might have notable side effects for some men.
Because these pills are swallowed, they affect your entire body. As the pill dilates the arteries and allows blood to enter the penis, it also dilates the entire system. This might cause flushing, headache, backache and other side effects (some too onerous for continued use).
Think about that! The pills make you feel so miserable that you prefer erectile dysfunction over sex. There are other medical treatments available.





The big pharma ED pills were real trailblazers - they created a market overnight. 
For most men those pills will often do the trick just fine. Unfortunately, they don't work well enough for everyone.
For some, they are too strong. For others, they aren’t strong enough. In many cases, they simply don’t work as advertised. There are other medical treatments available.
 

 

Many health issues such as diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), prostate issues and lifestyle choices (alcohol, diet and smoking) may also affect the ability to obtain and maintain an erection. 
 



The prostate is a gland that is found only in males and is located below the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate produces a nourishing liquid that protects the sperm.
With age, the cells in the prostate gland often enlarge and cause urination difficulties. This is commonly known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is not the same as prostate cancer. BPH can often be helped through medications that help reduce the size of the prostate.
Prostate cancer most commonly occurs when there is a mutation of the cells found in the glandular regions of the prostate. Prostate cancer usually develops slowly.  There are multiple ways to treat prostate cancer, including expectant management, surgery (radical or robotic), radiation (external and internal), cryosurgery, hormone therapy and chemotherapy.
One of the main questions men ask prior to surgery is, “How will these treatment options affect my ability to have and maintain an erection?”  Anatomically, a delicate web of nerves surrounds the prostate and many forms of treatment can affect this nerve net. These nerves are responsible for relaying the signals that control erections. Damage to these nerves can cause permanent change and prevent the ability to achieve and maintain an erection.
Oral medication, including the three most commonly prescribed pills, has proven to be ineffective for helping erectile function after nerve damage from prostate cancer treatment. These oral medications rely on nerve signals to increase blood flow into the penis.  When these nerves can no longer conduct signals to cause an erection, the next step is providing information directly to the penis.
Don’t let prostate cancer treatments prevent you from having a great sex life. There are other medical treatments available.

Erectile Dysfunction (ED) should NOT be ignored.
ED can significantly effect your love life and indicate a decline in your cardiovascular health.
According to a study done by the Australian National University, men with ED under the age of 55 are at risk of having heart disease, which makes sense because both the penis and your heart depend on healthy blood flow.

According to the project head, Emily Banks, “The risks of future heart disease and premature death increased steadily with severity of erectile dysfunction.” Men with severe ED and with no knowledge of having cardiovascular disease had a 35% chance to be hospitalized with an elevated 93% chance of mortality.
Based on these results, cardiovascular health director at Australia’s Heart Foundation stated, “These results tell us that every man who is suffering from any degree of erectile dysfunction should be seeking medical assistance as early as possible and also insisting on a heart health check by their GP at the same time.”
What can be determined from this research is that it's important to be diagnosed and understand the severity of your erectile dysfunction and what implications it may have for your health.

Some studies show that ED may be a marker for high blood pressure.
When blood pressure increases, it might damage the inner lining of the blood vessel, making it more difficult to bring and keep blood in the penis. If one is experiencing erectile dysfunction, it is important to be properly diagnosed to ensure that there are no other underlying health issues.

There are at least two types of high blood pressure medications that can cause erectile dysfunction:


Diuretics.  Also known as “water pills” and can reduce the amount of blood flow to the penis (which assists in maintaining a firmer erection).

Beta Blockers. Affect the same area of the nervous system that is responsible for producing erections.

Types of medication that do not affect sexual function are:

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
Calcium channel blockers
Angiotensin II receptor blockers
Alpha blockers

Alternatives to blood pressure medication include:

Eat healthily and in moderation
Stop smoking
Reduce sodium intake
Lose weight
Exercise daily (walk when possible)

According to the Mayo Clinic and other sources, drinking in moderation may offer some health benefits.
Alcohol is often associated with social events and celebrations, and tends to be a social lubricant leading to flirtatious and confident conversations between the sexes. There's a reason why alcohol is called liquid courage.
It is also commonly known that when a man has too much to drink, he may have temporary erectile dysfunction (the inability to perform while being inebriated). Excessive drinking can lead to a hindrance of sexual desire and the inability to become sexually stimulated.
Occasional social drinking can be fun, but when it comes to consistent binge drinking, the story changes. Excessive drinking can lead to negative repercussions. According to O’Keefe and Hunt, up to 75% of patients in alcohol rehabilitation programs have erectile dysfunction. Chronic alcohol abusers’ erectile failure may be the result of a combination of psychogenic and organic factors (for example, neuropathy).
An individual, on average, has the ability to metabolize one drink per hour. When more than one hourly drink is consumed, toxin levels increase in the body and begin to affect different organs.
Consistent binge drinking and alcoholism can lead to organ failure, in this instance, the penis. It is important to keep in mind that alcohol can affect your health and to also remember to drink responsibly to avoid any negative repercussions.




Erectile dysfunction issues are not uncommon for diabetics, however this should not prevent a full and enjoyable sex life.
Many men with diabetes who have ED might avoid seeking help in the mistaken belief that there is nothing that can be done. If you have tried the big pharma pills or any over the counter medication and have not seen results, please do not lose hope. You are not alone.  There are other medical treatments available.

 


Is your loss of interest due to ED or “Low T”?
Testosterone
Testosterone is a sex hormone produced mainly by the testicles. This hormone helps in the development of the testes and prostate, and also assists in increasing muscle mass, bone density, and the growth of body hair.
As men age the production of testosterone decreases; as the level declines, there may be a decrease in libido and an increase in lethargy. There could also be an increase of fat around the stomach and a drop in muscle definition. 
A percentage of men who use testosterone hormone replacement therapy might notice a sense of well-being, plus a decrease in abdominal fat and greater muscle definition. Increasing testosterone levels may yield additional positive effects, including Osteoporosis prevention. While replacing testosterone may help increase libido, it does not have a direct effect on erectile function.
Erectile Dysfunction
The average man in his 50’s is likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction. For some men this begins in their late teens, for others in their 60’s. As men grow older, the penis does not trap blood properly. This results in a softening of the erection. This condition can be helped with numerous treatments.
For an erection to occur, multiple physical dynamics are involved. First, an increase in arterial blood must flow into the penis. Then, that increased volume of blood must be trapped causing the veins (that normally carry blood away from the penis) to get engorged. 
The duration and strength of an erection are dependent upon the increased blood flow remaining in the penis. Age, medical conditions, medicines and lifestyle choices can affect the ability of the penis to receive and retain blood. This results in less firm erections or erectile dysfunction. 
It is possible that your lack of interest is due to “low T”. It is also possible that when your ED is treated your interest in intimacy will be renewed.
Unfortunately, erectile dysfunction will affect most men - this is simply a fact of life. It is nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed by. But there are other medical treatments available.
 
 





Women are taught, from the time of our first menses, that we will experience menopause. None of us are happy about it, some of us will fight it tooth and nail, but it is a fact of life.
Did you know that, as men age, they may experience hair loss, greying, wrinkles and a need for glasses, a larger belt and blood pressure pills? Many men will also stumble out of bed to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Yes, of course you did. These are inevitable facts and to be expected. 
Did you also know that most men will also experience a loss of erectile vitality as they age?  Probably not.
As systems age, just like the rest of our body parts, the penis will also lose its vitality including overall firmness, duration of the erection, staying power and possibly the ability to obtain an erection. Diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), prostate issues and lifestyle choices (diet and smoking) also affect the ability to obtain and maintain an erection. So, why do we believe men will continue to have satisfying erections until the end of their lives?
Sex can be complicated.  Relationships between the sexes can be even more complicated.  When this happens, the emotions both parties experience are more complicated still.
The commonly-known pills will often do the trick just fine for a while; however, these pills might have some serious considerations:


Oftentimes, these pills are simply not effective with some medical conditions (prostate issues, paralysis, diabetes, hypertension).

The fact that they are swallowed affects the entire system.  As they dilate the arteries and allow the blood to enter the penis more easily, they also dilate the entire system.  This might cause “flushing,” headache, backache and other side effects (some too onerous for continued use).
They will eventually lose their effectiveness.

This is not unusual. This is not his fault. And it is certainly not your fault. It’s natural and to be expected. But it’s not the end. There are other medical treatments available.



      









Two factors which affect how long the penis stays UP:

Sensitivity​: Determined by how many vibration sensors a man was born with in his penis. Men with more vibration sensors climax more quickly.

Brain Receptors​: Receive the vibration information from the penis and are affected by alcohol, which slows their response times.

Five to ten percent of men climax early. This is a physical reaction, NOT psychological. 

Because with age...



The time between penetration and ejaculation tends to decrease.
The ability of the penis to re-charge, and climax again, declines.
A very small percentage of men lose the ability to climax.

All medications are compounded to meet the couple's specific needs. Depending upon an UP! doctor's opinion and the man's health, our medication can be customized to maintain an erection for as long as you'd like, up to an hour or more. Possibly with multiple ejaculations.

Who can use these treatments? UP!'s medication can be used by all males ages 18-99. A doctor's consultation is always necessary to ensure that our physicians prescribe the proper medication for your current medical condition (taking into account your complete medical history, including other prescription medications). 


How quickly will the medications take effect? UP! Centers for Men offers various types of medication, all of which are prescribed and formulated in our compounded pharmacy for each individual patient. Oral medication is administered sub-lingually (under the tongue) and typically works within 30-90 minutes and may be taken with a meal. Topical medication works within 15 minutes. Penile injections begin to work immediately, but can take up to 20 minutes to reach its full effect.


What are the side effects of the medicine? The side effects vary depending on what type of medication you use. Oral medication may have mild side effects such as nausea or headaches. Topical medication's side effects vary depending on the strength of the dose. Prolonged erections with topical medication tends to be rare. Penile injections have the potential to cause prolonged erections, dependent upon dosage - this side effect can usually be avoided if the doctor's instructions are properly followed.


How often can I use the medications? The frequency of use depends upon the doctor's diagnosis, but the following are FDA approved guidelines for use of the medication types. The oral medication can be used every 2 to 3 days due to the half-life of the formulation. The topical medication can be used once per day. The penile injections can be used once per day.


If I am prescribed a penile injection, is it painful to use? The injection is often not noticed when administered by a physician. When self-administered as instructed it is usually painless, safe and effective. The injection is administered with an automated device, which is extremely quick and efficient.


Is my prescription really made specifically for me? Yes, UP!'s medications are formulated in a compounding pharmacy based upon the doctor's prescription for the individual.

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(18, 26, 13); font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal;"">By utilizing state of the art balance equipment from Bosu® to challenge you in ways traditional training cannot, Corbing™ teaches individuals to execute core and balance-intensive dynamic movements and static hold initiated and controlled from the core on three different surfaces: the floor, the Bosu® Balance Trainer, and the Bosu® Ballast® Ball. What makes this form of training so unique are the <b>seamless interconnections</b> and <b>fluid nature</b> made possible by what we call ""transitional"" movements. However, this program can also be approached from a more traditional training structure with a specified number of sets, repetitions, and rest periods to allow you to focus on specific exercises.</span><br/>

While this ""traditional"" approach does have its various health benefits, its application to real-life activities is often very limited.</p>

Corbing™ chooses to focus on what we believe to be the most important factors for better performance in athletics as well as life. These factors are balance, core strength and control, dynamic full-body movement, reaction abilities/coordination, flexibility, and mind-body connection. Corbing™ is not intended to monopolize your exercise routine. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other forms of exercise and sport-specific training to provide you the opportunity to develop your strongest and most balanced self.</p>

Your core is what connects your upper and lower body together. All of your physical movement originates from your core. The name says it all. It is the core of your body. It is involved in everything from everyday living activities to elite level athletics. Thus a stronger core allows your movements to become more powerful and effective. In athletics, this translates to better performance. In life, this translates to an improvement in your everyday life tasks and reduced risk for injury. By creating a strong core foundation, we set the base for developing our most athletic self.</p>

Being able to remain stable and in control in a constantly changing environment is the foundation for successful movement not only in sports, but also life. The more control you have over your balance, the more efficient and safe you will be in your movements. Executing movements on unstable surfaces (Bosu® equipment) forces our bodies to adapt to this instability by cultivating stability. This translates to better balance, strength, and performance. It is not enough to simply build strong muscles anymore. We must also create smart muscles that work in a synergistic manner with the rest of our bodies.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
By utilizing state of the art balance equipment from Bosu® to challenge you in ways traditional training cannot, Corbing™ teaches individuals to execute core and balance-intensive dynamic movements and static hold initiated and controlled from the core on three different surfaces: the floor, the Bosu® Balance Trainer, and the Bosu® Ballast® Ball. What makes this form of training so unique are the seamless interconnections and fluid nature made possible by what we call ""transitional"" movements. However, this program can also be approached from a more traditional training structure with a specified number of sets, repetitions, and rest periods to allow you to focus on specific exercises.

Corbing™ can help you:
     -Increase core strength and control
     -Increase all aspects of body strength
     -Increase athletic performance
     -Improve all aspects of balance
     -Improve coordination
     -Improve reaction speeds/abilities
     -Improve body awareness and control
     -Improve functional movements
     -Increase mind-body connection/awarenessExercise is not just for athletes looking to increase performance. It is a way to train our bodies and minds to respond appropriately and effectively to the constantly changing environment that is our world. When most people think of ""traditional"" exercise, they often picture a row of machines and a very rigidly structured exercise program that lacks creativity and imagination. While this ""traditional"" approach does have its various health benefits, its application to real-life activities is often very limited.
In athletics as well as everyday life, having the ability to move our bodies in an effective, efficient, and synergistic manner translates to better performance and reduced risk for injury. When we teach our bodies to work as one complete unit, we begin to truly unleash our full athletic potential. When combined with other forms of exercise and sport-specific training, Corbing™ can provide the avenue all athletes are searching for to gain an edge on their competition. For the non-athlete, Corbing™ can provide the training to increase all aspects of fitness so you can increase your quality of life.The Material

I have written a 560 page instructional training manual for Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert levels of Corbing™. However, gaining a strong understanding as to the mechanics and the execution  of some the more complex movements can be difficult to ascertain just through descriptions and pictures. It is for this reason that many of the more complex movements will also need to be explained through a visual demonstration in the form of a short video. A corresponding DVD will come with the training manual to help participants successfully learn to execute the movements safely and properly. 
As participants learn the various movements, there is a section in the  instructional manual to help individuals construct their own workouts. We have listed hundreds of suggested compatible exercise sequences listed in the back of the manual to help people get started building fun, creative, and challenging workouts. 
Having successfully written the instructional manual and chosen the exercises that will be explained on the corresponding instructional DVD, we need to come up with the funding to:
     -Publish the manual in both hardcopy and electronic form through a Publishing company (Bookmasters).
-Hire a small film crew to film, edit, and create an interactive DVD for the list of chosen Corbing™ movements that are to be explained through visual demonstration (Paper Star Productions).
It is my goal to change the way people look at exercise. I want to inspire people to move their bodies and improve their health. Exercise is my passion and it is a great way to improve your quality of life. Corbing™ is simply a new, unique, creative, and challenging way to increase your fitness level, whether it be for a specific sport or better overall health. Indiegogo....help us make Corbing™ a success!!! What We Need & What You Get Since the Corbing™ instructional manual is already written, the list of exercises to be explained through visual demonstrations on the corresponding DVD have already been selected, and I will be performing the demonstrations, the only real hurdle left is raising the capital to fund the publishing of the project. The publisher (Bookmasters) already gave us a quote for both the hardcopy and electronic publishing, as did the Film Crew (Paper Star Productions).Once the capital is raised, the actual filming of the corresponding DVD will only take 2 days to film and a week to edit and format into an interactive DVD. The publishing for the hardcopy as well as electronic manual will take about two weeks to have products in hand.Paper Star Productions has quoted us at $6450.00 for the entire interactive DVD production. The itemized list is as follows:Crew of 3 for shoot- 2 days= $3000.00 Equipment rental- 2 days= $500.00 Gym/Space rental- 2 days= $600.00 VO recording- 1/2 day= $250.00 Editing- 4 days= $2000.00 misc materials- $100.00 Grand Total= $6450.00The quote for the electronic and hardcopy publishing of the Corbing™ manual from Bookmasters is as follows: -$11.60 per book for 100 copies of the black and white version of physical manual. -$720 for the conversion of both the ePUB and ePDF file types. The start-up cost for the E-book distribution service that distributes to various Online E-book retailers is normally $395 with a monthly fee of $22.95 x12 months. So the grand total for 100 hardcopies, both electronic versions, and E-book distribution option is $2,550.40This plus the DVD production quote puts us at a grand total of 9,000.40. We are anticipating a few unexpected expenses along the way to get this fully published and launched so we are asking for an additional $1,000 buffer money to ensure that these unexpected expenses can be dealt with swiftly to ensure fast delivery of the finished product. If successful, Indiegogo will take a percentage of the project. This is partly what the extra money is for. So in order for us to get the full $9,000, we are setting the fundraiser goal for $10,000.I believe the most challenging aspect is going to be the 2 full days it takes to film the movements for the instructional DVD and doing the audio voice-over narration for the actual descriptions. There are always setbacks that occur with any major project. Any setbacks that do occur, however major or minor, will be dealt with swiftly and effectively with the same dedication and determination I put into developing this entire Corbing™ method, manual, and Indiegogo project. I will be honest and transparent with all my backers and keep them informed every step of this process.The ImpactI have spent the last two years of my life living with my parents so that I could devote all of my time and energy to developing this new and exciting method of exercise. I'm Attention Deficit, so this was not the easiest task in the world. The downside of this is that I didn't work full-time and thus have no money to fund this enterprise. That being said, I will stop at nothing to make Corbing™ successful. Getting the funding from Indiegogo will make this process exponentially faster and easier, but be clear that I will do everything in my power to make Corbing™ a success whether this fundraising project succeeds or not. For the past two years, I have poured my heart, soul, and limited funds into this endeavor to get to where I'm at right now. Should this fundraiser be successful, rest assured that I will back my end of the deal as quickly and professionally as possible with complete transparency. I am extremely passionate about this and with your help, we can make Corbing™ a success and change the way people exercise!Corbing™ is the first of its kind with regard to exercise. It is a new, unique, creative, challenging, and fun way to stimulate the body and mind through physical movement. In a country where obesity has become an epidemic, coming up with new ways to inspire people to improve their health is invaluable. We have done a number of Corbing™ demonstrations at various fitness conventions and the response is overwhelmingly positive! People get excited when they discover this new and stimulating method of exercise! They express genuine interest in wanting to learn to develop new levels of core strength and balance through this new method of training. So help me take my passion for exercise and inspire people to improve their health because health is the foundation for a happy life:)Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you cannot contribute you can still help Corbing™ succeed. Help spread the word that there is a new and exciting method of training out there for people of all ability levels. Share our video, share this campaign page, share anything because we want to reach as many people as possible not only to make this fundraiser successful, but to help increase awareness that will hopefully inspire more people to improve their health!Extensive Description of Corbing™ philosophy, objectives, and equipment
The Future of Exercise
There are many factors that contribute to better performance. Corbing™ chooses to focus on what we believe to be the most important factors for better performance in athletics as well as life. These factors are balance, core strength and control, dynamic full-body movement, reaction abilities/coordination, flexibility, and mind-body connection. Corbing™ is not intended to monopolize your exercise routine. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other forms of exercise and sport-specific training to provide you the opportunity to develop your strongest and most balanced self.
The Core
Your core is the foundation of all movement. Your core is what connects your upper and lower body together. All of your physical movement originates from your core. The name says it all. It is the core of your body. It is involved in everything from everyday living activities to elite level athletics. Thus a stronger core allows your movements to become more powerful and effective. In athletics, this translates to better performance. In life, this translates to an improvement in your everyday life tasks and reduced risk for injury. By creating a strong core foundation, we set the base for developing our most athletic self.
The Importance of Balance
Balance, or proprioception, is essentially your awareness of where your body is in relation to space. Being able to remain stable and in control in a constantly changing environment is the foundation for successful movement not only in sports, but also life. The more control you have over your balance, the more efficient and safe you will be in your movements. Executing movements on unstable surfaces (Bosu® equipment) forces our bodies to adapt to this instability by cultivating stability. This translates to better balance, strength, and performance. It is not enough to simply build strong muscles anymore. We must also create smart muscles that work in a synergistic manner with the rest of our bodies.
Connecting the Mind to the BodyFor most of us, exercise is a tool that is meant to enrich our lives outside of the gym by providing us with better health. Whether it is a sports-related goal or simply a desire to increase fitness for everyday living, exercise is a great means by which to achieve these things. As a child who was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder at the age of 5, I struggled my entire life with focus. Exercise was the vehicle that taught me how to focus by connecting my mind to my body. Surprisingly enough, many people who exercise focus solely on the body and forget to incorporate the mind. In a world filled with stressful stimuli, it is inconceivable that most people do not allocate time and energy toward strengthening their minds like they do their bodies. When you are Corbing™, you are focusing on many different aspects of fitness ranging from coordination, core strength, to breath awareness. More importantly, you are cultivating the ability to cope with emotions such as frustration, disappointment, doubt in your own capabilities, feelings of failure, and other such adverse emotions. By using exercise, in this case Corbing™, as a medium to overcome these obstacles in the fitness arena, you will develop confidence in your ability to deal with similar obstacles in other areas of your life.

If your mind is not on the same page as your body, your training will likely suffer. However, when you obtain strong mental and physical engagement, your training will be much more enjoyable and effective. Balance training requires a significant amount of focus, much more so than simply getting onto a stationary bike for an hour. It can be extremely frustrating at times, but this required level of intense focus provides the environment to overcome these various mental and physical obstacles. As your proficiency increases, you will slowly begin to experience a mind-body phenomenon we call ""flow."" This is the state where your mind becomes completely connected to your body and time slows to only the present. You are completely engaged in the now. It is a powerful state of mind that requires focus, persistence, and dedication to attain. 
Progression
Ballast® Ball-based Corbing™ is more difficult to learn initially, so we have broken down the movements to their most basic forms so they can be performed on more forgiving surfaces and equipment including floor mats and the Bosu® Balance Trainer. This natural progression from floor to Balance Trainer to Ballast® Ball allows your body and mind the adequate time and repetition to safely learn and execute the movements. Should you choose to never progress to the Ballast® Ball, there are still endless possibilities for challenging workouts on the floor and Balance Trainer.
Corbing™ Philosophy
Corbing™ is difficult. There is a learning curve, and the higher level movements can involve some risk. As you progress into these intermediate and advanced level exercises, you will fall down. If it were easy, the rewards would be small. As infants, we all progressed from crawling to walking, but what we must remember is that the period in between those two points was filled with countless stumbles and falls. As stated earlier, the mental battles you will face and conquer are just as important as the physical ones. 
With dedication and determination, you can and will progress to levels you never thought you could achieve both mentally and physically. Use this confidence to then achieve success in all other areas of your life. The only way you can fail in this program is by quitting. Every slip, stumble, and fall is one step closer to stabilization. The path to success in this program is filled with many mistakes, plenty of frustration, and humility. When you fall, pick yourself up and keep moving forward.
Remember that Corbing™ stresses the importance of balance in all aspects of your training not only physically but metaphorically as well. Part of any successful exercise program lies in the balance of its variety. As stated earlier, Corbing™ is not meant to monopolize your training. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other forms of training. When used in this manner, it will add a new and stimulating element to your training that will help you develop your strongest and most balanced self.
The Balance Trainer
The Bosu® Pro Balance Trainer is one of the most versatile pieces of balance equipment in the fitness industry. Although it appears small and simple, when utilized properly this piece of equipment can become a catalyst for serious fitness gains. Its design allows individuals from all athletic abilities to utilize it at various levels of difficulty. Because it can also be utilized on both sides by simply turning the device over, you can dramatically alter the way your body is challenged. In addition, it is safer than a stability ball for reasons related to potential fall height. Its profile is low enough to the floor that in the event of a loss of balance, an individual can simply step down onto solid ground to safety. Whether one is a beginner level participant improving his/her ability to simply stand and balance, or an advanced level participant executing high degree difficulty maneuvers, the Balance Trainer is usable by everyone in the exercise population. Due to the stationary nature of the Balance Trainer, it is more compatible from a classic workout structure with sets and repetitions. While it is possible to execute many transitions on the Balance Trainer, it is difficult to attain the true interconnected and seamless transitions that you can attain on dry-land and Ballast® Ball Pro surfaces. That being said, it is quite possibly the most versatile piece of equipment in this manual.

A comparison of the vital parameters such as length/height, head circumference and weight determine a child growthThere's a lot going on in those first three years of a child . While every baby develops differently and at their own pace, but there are milestones to look out for.The absence of certain milestones or a delay in acquiring new skills may be a sign of an underlying problem or a medical illness.The length of a baby at birth is approximately 50cms. By the first year it increases by 50% to 75 cms. By the end of third year it increases by 12 cms. Low height for age indicates nutritional stunting or dwarfing. It reflects past or chronic stunting. A baby's brain and head do 80 percent of their growing during the first two years. Measuring head circumference helps to track the brain's growth as the skull bones fuse together.The most common disability associated with this is, intellectual delay; other common concomitant conditions include epilepsy, cerebral palsy, language delay, strabismus, ophthalmologic disorders, and cardiac, renal, urinary tract, microcephaly, and skeletal anomalies.Early identification of Length and Head circumference concerns can be a critical first step in identifying disorders  leading to referral to paediatric specialists and, as needed, provision of family-centered early intervention services.To make it easier, we MEZHER will help parents by developing the world's first integrated growth monitoring kit to take these measurements at home with simple and easy techniques (elaborated by the World Health Organisation),  understand and interpret the results to make sure your child’s growth are on track.

The 6GCool goes with you anywhere so you can have clean air everywhere.HEPA + PECO Filtration = The Best Protection6GCool's advanced filtration system offers unrivalled performance compared to other air purifiers of similar size or even many of the much larger devices.  The first powerful high-tech air purifier that fits in your pocketThe innovation is simple, yet radical. We compressed the power of larger air purifiers into a pocket-sized device.  Small, yet powerful!6G inhales dirty air from the bottom and releases clean fresh air out from the top, through an adjustable outlet. ​Our team has over 30 years of dedication to innovation in air filtration technologies. The 6GCool is the first air purifier to use the industry standard HEPA filtration together with state-of-art PECO filtration technology.   Enjoy Clean Air Everywhere! The 6GCool uses our patented 4-step filtration process to create a zone of safe air around you. 6G allows you to take clean air to where it has previously been impossible. It is perfect for:  More comfortable than a normal maskFace masks are great for protecting OTHERS, but the 6GCool is made for protecting YOU. The 6G is not only more comfortable to wear but it has the most sophisticated filtration system available in a carry on size.   The Science Of Clean Air6GCool uses our patented 4-step filtration process, including HEPA filter, anti-bacterial TiO2 layer, air ioniser and UV light. 6GCool  is capable of outputting 2.43 m3/h of clean air, an impressive number for a small air purifier! 
A Revolutionary Way To Purify AirInstead of cleaning the ambient air around you, 6G creates a personal zone of clean air where you need it. This is a new innovative approach to cleaning air! The 6GCool uses 4 filtration steps for maximum protection!6GCool has been tested by renowned independent laboratories to global standards, including particle filtration test PM2.5, PM1.0 and PM0.5 (GB/T 18801-2015).   Order your 6GCool now on IndiegogoShipping in January 2021!What you get? The 6GCool Mobile Air Purifier, Adjustable Neck Strap, Charging Cable and 5 x Filters (typically gets over 6 months of use).Replacement filter packs are available with the checkout.   Press  Scandinavian Design & Function But I already have an air purifier inside my home, why would I need the 6G?The problem is often you are the most exposed to dirty air while you are on the move: commuting, travelling, at the office or socialising. Before there has not really been a good way to protect yourself. Now there is with 6G. We think this is a revolutionary new approach to clean air.  Unboxing the pre-production samples!  When we started designing 6G over a year ago, we had no idea we would be launching it amidst the worst air catastrophes in our generation. Over the last few months, we have had to do a lot of additional tests to make sure the 6G is 2020 proof.  Shipping in December 2020!We have worked extra hard to bring the 6GCool to the market and we are happy to announce the device is ready to start shipping before the end of 2020.    Quiet 6200 rpm/min fanWe designed 6G to have 3 operating modes – turbo, medium and silent – to suit your busy life. Turbo Mode expels larger volume of clean air out and is perfect for when you are on the move or in a crowded environment whereas the Silent Mode is perfect in a more stationary situation where you need the air purifier to work in the background.Turbo mode pushes as much as 2.8m/s of filtered clean air out through the adjustable outlet.  Adjustable neck strapEvery air purifier includes an adjustable neck strap for you to easily carry the device around your neck while using it or to attach it to your outfit. Our neck strap includes quick release clips for easy removal and safety breakaway clip. Testing & CertificationsThe power of 6G is based on the innovation of creating a personal clean air zone. Instead of cleaning a large room, 6G focuses on cleaning the air around your face. Performance testingWe have tested 6G against the common air pollutants PM2.5, PM1.0 and PM0.5. For more test results please visit our website.We have teamed up with globally renowned labs in Europe and Asia to run the 6GCool through some of the most rigorous testing protocols.   Simple To UseWe designed the 6G to adapt to your life on the go.   Our Patented 6G Filter Technology1.

As a special one time offer, order today and get regular video updates from the lady herself!While we can't make her cancer disappear, we can help Diem find a little peace of mind amidst the chaos that is cancer. We felt that this was the best way to show our support and love for Diem--to give her the chance to start her own family, as we all begin to start ours. -- With love from Niki and Monica (with Diem's consent)Other Ways You Can Help

</div><h3>
</h3><h3>Do you know what the
deadliest animal in the world is?    Most people in South Carolina would probably say
snakes. Wrong!</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p><b>The
most deadly animal in the world is the mosquito! </b>As quiet and little as it is, it is responsible for over 1 million deaths per year.  Over 600,000 deaths per year from one
disease, Malaria. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by
parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected
mosquitoes. Can you imagine one child dying every 30-45 seconds due to a
mosquito bite? Most people in the USA will say no way. However, this
is a reality in parts of the world. </p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We
are a textile chemical company located in South Carolina. Our products are used by
textile mills to help produce fibers and fabrics. We have also developed a
product that we think is a game changer in the fight against insect borne
diseases. It is the Skintex® MRIII Cover! Skintex® MRIII is the only EPA
registered microencapsulated insect repellent system for textiles. The Skintex® MR III cover is
a unique vector tool that is not currently being used to fight insect borne
diseases.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We
want to introduce the Skintex® MRIII Cover to the area of the world that is
most devastated by malaria; Uganda
and its surrounding countries. By you helping us, we can supply our Skintex® MRIII
Covers to families in Uganda
and surrounding countries. The result will be saved lives. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Creating
access to the Skintex® MRIII Covers is important because there has been a
change in the areas where insect borne diseases are most prevalent.  With
the wars in Africa and the natural disasters
that have affected millions in under developed countries, there are millions of
people that are transient and have no real shelter. Currently, the main tools
used to control the spread of these diseases are the mosquito net and inside
residual spraying.  These are not the most useful tools when you have a
transient population as we have today. If a family has no home they have no
where to hang a bed net or walls to spray. The Skintex® MRIII Cover can help
protect these people when they have no structure in which to hang a net or
spray. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How
does the Skintex® MRIII Cover work?  It is simple; when the cover is in
use the microcapsules burst which releases permethrin onto the textile. This
creates a HOTFOOT scenario for a mosquito. When a mosquito lands on the textile
and attempts to feed, it will come into contact with permethrin and permethrin
filled microcapsules. Once the microcapsules burst, the mosquito is dosed with
the released permethrin. The result is a DEAD or KNOCKED DOWN mosquito. In
independent WHO tube testing, the cover provides 100% KNOCKDEAD/KNOCKDOWN
results. In independent Chamber or Cage testing, the result is the typical
amount of landings, but ZERO bites.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Whether
it has been independent lab testing, independent field trials or customer
feedback, the Skintex® MRIII cover has proven to be very effective at killing
disease carrying insects. It has been toxicologically tested and tested for
skin contact. It is considered safe for human use.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We
want to get as many Skintex® MRIII Covers to the people who need them the most,
as fast as possible. To start with, we want to produce at least 50,000 Covers.
This will require $800,000. We are ready to go. We just need your help to get
started. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>We
have partnered with Maryland
Information Technology Center, Inc (MITC) and Prime Star Mills to help us
create a sustainable infrastructure and distribution of Skintex® MRIII Covers.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>What
is MITC?   MITC is a not for profit organization located in Rockville,
Maryland It is dedicated to performing contract research and studies
emphasizing immediate improvement of current national practices of underdeveloped countries. Their goal is for both private and governmental organizations to become equal
participants in the global economy in 20-25 years.  As a 501(c)(3) organization MITC uses
profits, undesignated grants, and gifts to increase nation building
governmental and corporate growth capabilities. This includes activities such
as the prevention of malaria and other related diseases.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>Why
is disease prevention so important to nation building?   Malaria is a huge
financial burden for not only a country, but families as well. Countries with
high rates of malaria can spend a huge percentage of their national budget
trying to prevent the spread of the disease. Malaria is Uganda’s leading
cause of morbidity and mortality. According to the Ugandan Ministry of Health,
malaria accounts for 25-40% of outpatient visits to health facilities and
is responsible for nearly half of inpatient pediatric deaths. Malaria can
devastate a family’s financial well being.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>What
is Prime Star Mills?   Prime Star Mills (PSM) is a textile mill located in
Kampala, the capitol of Uganda. PSM
will receive the treated fabric and will convert it into the Skintex® MRIII
Covers. When the fabric has been converted, PSM will work locally with
distributions partners to get the Skintex® MRIII Covers to families in the
region. We believe, by having  local mills convert the fabric into the
Skintex® MRIII Covers, will create a sense of ownership of the local people. It
will also provide local jobs. PSM is currently working with the humanitarian
group, Rotary International, as a possible distributor. </p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How
will the funding be used?   100% of the contributions will be used to
produce Skintex® MRIII Covers, create an infrastructure and distribution
logistics within Africa. Ultimately, this will
lead to families in Africa receiving a new
malaria prevention tool. Any funding in excess of the goal will be rolled back
into the program so even more families can receive a Skintex® MRIII Cover.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Insect
borne diseases will always be a challenge. Over the next 5-10-15 years we
expect large growth in products that can help control or eradicate insects that
spread these deceases. Our product, The Skintex® MRIII Cover, is a tool that is
available today and can play a very significant role. With the millions of
displaced people in the world the Skintex® MRIII Cover is ideal. By 2050, our
hope is to be able to say the Skintex® MRIII Cover was one of the tools that helped
wipe out malaria.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The
Skintex® MRIII Cover is a great tool that can be used by families, even in
countries where malaria is not present. We have had people place it on the
ground under lawn chairs which not only prevented mosquito bites, but also other
types of insects from biting their ankles and legs. We have had soccer moms use
it at their kid’s soccer games. It is a great camping tool. In addition to the
cover, the Skintex® MRIII treatment can be applied to essentially any garment
in the market, shirts, pants, hats, tick guards and so on. No matter the
scenario, we have always had outstanding reviews for treated garments and gear.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p>With
the Skintex® MRIII Cover's performance in mind, we want you to experience its
great benefits while at the same time helping us rid the world of malaria and other
insect borne diseases.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>Skintex®

<p>The

completed in Africa. All of the results have been
outstanding. The feedback from the small amount of people in Africa

deadliest animal in the world is?    Most people in South Carolina would probably say
snakes. Wrong!

The
most deadly animal in the world is the mosquito! As quiet and little as it is, it is responsible for over 1 million deaths per year.  Over 600,000 deaths per year from one
disease, Malaria. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by
parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected
mosquitoes. Can you imagine one child dying every 30-45 seconds due to a
mosquito bite? Most people in the USA will say no way. However, this
is a reality in parts of the world. 

We
are a textile chemical company located in South Carolina. Our products are used by
textile mills to help produce fibers and fabrics. We have also developed a
product that we think is a game changer in the fight against insect borne
diseases. It is the Skintex® MRIII Cover! Skintex® MRIII is the only EPA
registered microencapsulated insect repellent system for textiles. The Skintex® MR III cover is
a unique vector tool that is not currently being used to fight insect borne
diseases.

We
want to introduce the Skintex® MRIII Cover to the area of the world that is
most devastated by malaria; Uganda
and its surrounding countries. By you helping us, we can supply our Skintex® MRIII
Covers to families in Uganda
and surrounding countries. The result will be saved lives. 

Creating
access to the Skintex® MRIII Covers is important because there has been a
change in the areas where insect borne diseases are most prevalent.  With
the wars in Africa and the natural disasters
that have affected millions in under developed countries, there are millions of
people that are transient and have no real shelter. Currently, the main tools
used to control the spread of these diseases are the mosquito net and inside
residual spraying.  These are not the most useful tools when you have a
transient population as we have today. If a family has no home they have no
where to hang a bed net or walls to spray. The Skintex® MRIII Cover can help
protect these people when they have no structure in which to hang a net or
spray. 

How
does the Skintex® MRIII Cover work?  It is simple; when the cover is in
use the microcapsules burst which releases permethrin onto the textile. This
creates a HOTFOOT scenario for a mosquito. When a mosquito lands on the textile
and attempts to feed, it will come into contact with permethrin and permethrin
filled microcapsules. Once the microcapsules burst, the mosquito is dosed with
the released permethrin. The result is a DEAD or KNOCKED DOWN mosquito. In
independent WHO tube testing, the cover provides 100% KNOCKDEAD/KNOCKDOWN
results. In independent Chamber or Cage testing, the result is the typical
amount of landings, but ZERO bites.

Whether
it has been independent lab testing, independent field trials or customer
feedback, the Skintex® MRIII cover has proven to be very effective at killing
disease carrying insects. It has been toxicologically tested and tested for
skin contact. It is considered safe for human use.

We
want to get as many Skintex® MRIII Covers to the people who need them the most,
as fast as possible. To start with, we want to produce at least 50,000 Covers.
This will require $800,000. We are ready to go. We just need your help to get

</h3> <p></p>
<p>My name is Steve Pashley and I have Type 2 Diabetes.</p>
<p>I founded the Dare Two Foundation because I believe that Design Thinking has 
the power to impact the lives of people with prediabetes—to increase 
awareness of the disease and the importance of diagnosis, and motivate 
healthy behaviors that can help prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. 
Dare Two will achieve this goal by applying the Design Thinking process 
of research, ideation, testing and implementation to create solutions 
that make a difference in the fight to prevent type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Did you
know that there are 29.1 million people
with diabetes
in the US alone? Over 90% of those people have type 2 diabetes. There are an additional 86 million people in the US with
prediabetes<sup>1</sup>. That’s right—1 in 3
Americans has prediabetes!  Only 10% of those 86 million prediabetics have been diagnosed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1073115/files/20141205035004-diabetes_facts.png?1417780204"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span><b>By 2050, it's estimated that as many as 1 in 3 Americans could have type 2 diabetes. </b></span></p>
<p><span>Our vision is a world free of type 2 
diabetes—and there is reason to hope. A trial run by the National Institute of 
Health (NIH), the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)<sup>2</sup>, showed that with 
aggressive health and nutrition intervention, almost 60% of patients 
with prediabetes were able to reverse their condition.</span></p>
<p><span>The Dare Two Foundation is dedicated to raising awareness and diagnosing   millions of people with prediabetes because that is where the opportunity lies. Early diagnosis and aggressive 
intervention—diet changes, increasing physical activity, monitoring 
blood sugar and building healthy lifestyles—can help many people with 
prediabetes reverse their condition. We will prevent type 2 diabetes by 
stopping it in its tracks—when the warning signs first appear as 
prediabetes. <b>But we need your help...</b><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We’re running our first annual fundraising campaign to raise $14,500 for startup costs which will cover initial legal, accounting, and insurance fees. This initial funding will also help us get the word out about what we are doing, the risks and health dangers of type 2 diabetes, and ways that Americans can prevent type 2 diabetes in their lives and the lives of those they care about.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Type 2 diabetes costs us all—in direct medical costs, lost productivity, reduced quality of life and the loss of family members too soon.</p>
<p>The total cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 was estimated <b>$245 billion</b>. That's $176 billion in medical costs and $69 billion in lost productivity.</p>

<p>Diabetes
 was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2010, listed as the underlying cause of death for 69,000 people. Diabetes was mentioned as a contributing cause of death in 234,000 cases. And diabetes may be dramatically underreported as a cause of death. One study found that only 35-40% of those with diabetes who died had diabetes listed as a cause of death.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a 'hidden' crisis—only 10% of the 86 million people with prediabetes even know they have it. Awareness is key.</p>
<p><b>We want to diagnose 77 million new prediabetics.</b><br/></p>
<p>Preventing type 2 diabetes requires lifestyle changes and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle - better diet, more physical activity, understanding and monitoring your blood sugar consistently. These are not insignificant changes. We understand that. By applying the Design Thinking process of
research, ideation, testing and implementation, we will identify the small opportunities that lead to big changes.</p>
<p>One example of a small change with the potential for big impact is our concept for the Sugar-Smart Shopper app. The Dare Two Sugar-Smart Shopper App is designed to simplify food shopping for people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The mobile app operates in the most simple manner – scan the bar code of an item in the store and we’ll provide a simple, clear message letting you know if that item is a healthy option for people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Using the iconic red, yellow, green stoplight color palette, we’ll provide straight-forward guidance on each item you scan:</p>
<p>Considering a loaf of white bread? That’s a big red NO! We’ll send you this simple message: <br/><i>“White bread is high in processed sugar and has a high glycemic index.  Consider buying whole wheat bread or, even better, whole grain breads.”</i></p>
<p>What about pineapple? That’s a yellow light. <br/><i>“Pineapples are high in natural sugars. You can eat some pineapple but try adding high fiber fruits like apples to your basket as well.”</i></p>
<p>I love fish. How about the wild-caught salmon? Green light! <br/><i>“Wild caught salmon is an excellent source of high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals – and it’s loaded with healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Go for it!”</i></p>

</div></div>","We Dare Two impact the lives of those with Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes.
 
My name is Steve Pashley and I have Type 2 Diabetes.
I founded the Dare Two Foundation because I believe that Design Thinking has 
the power to impact the lives of people with prediabetes—to increase 
awareness of the disease and the importance of diagnosis, and motivate 
healthy behaviors that can help prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. 
Dare Two will achieve this goal by applying the Design Thinking process 
of research, ideation, testing and implementation to create solutions 
that make a difference in the fight to prevent type 2 diabetes.

Did you
know that there are 29.1 million people
with diabetes
in the US alone? Over 90% of those people have type 2 diabetes. There are an additional 86 million people in the US with
prediabetes1. That’s right—1 in 3
Americans has prediabetes!  Only 10% of those 86 million prediabetics have been diagnosed.

By 2050, it's estimated that as many as 1 in 3 Americans could have type 2 diabetes. 
Our vision is a world free of type 2 
diabetes—and there is reason to hope. A trial run by the National Institute of 
Health (NIH), the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)2, showed that with 
aggressive health and nutrition intervention, almost 60% of patients 
with prediabetes were able to reverse their condition.
The Dare Two Foundation is dedicated to raising awareness and diagnosing   millions of people with prediabetes because that is where the opportunity lies. Early diagnosis and aggressive 
intervention—diet changes, increasing physical activity, monitoring 
blood sugar and building healthy lifestyles—can help many people with 
prediabetes reverse their condition. We will prevent type 2 diabetes by 
stopping it in its tracks—when the warning signs first appear as 
prediabetes. But we need your help...



We’re running our first annual fundraising campaign to raise $14,500 for startup costs which will cover initial legal, accounting, and insurance fees. This initial funding will also help us get the word out about what we are doing, the risks and health dangers of type 2 diabetes, and ways that Americans can prevent type 2 diabetes in their lives and the lives of those they care about.


 What We Need
 Our goal is to raise $14,500 for startup costs. This initial funding
will be used as follows:

Finally, you will receive an invitation to participate in one of our in-person ideation sessions* where you'll have a direct hand in shaping the future of the Dare Two Foundation and our approach to preventing type 2 diabetes.


  The Impact Type 2 diabetes costs us all—in direct medical costs, lost productivity, reduced quality of life and the loss of family members too soon.
The total cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 was estimated $245 billion. That's $176 billion in medical costs and $69 billion in lost productivity.







Diabetes
 was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2010, listed as the underlying cause of death for 69,000 people. Diabetes was mentioned as a contributing cause of death in 234,000 cases. And diabetes may be dramatically underreported as a cause of death. One study found that only 35-40% of those with diabetes who died had diabetes listed as a cause of death.
  Risks & Challenges
Type 2 diabetes is a 'hidden' crisis—only 10% of the 86 million people with prediabetes even know they have it. Awareness is key.
We want to diagnose 77 million new prediabetics.
Preventing type 2 diabetes requires lifestyle changes and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle - better diet, more physical activity, understanding and monitoring your blood sugar consistently. These are not insignificant changes. We understand that. By applying the Design Thinking process of
research, ideation, testing and implementation, we will identify the small opportunities that lead to big changes.
One example of a small change with the potential for big impact is our concept for the Sugar-Smart Shopper app. The Dare Two Sugar-Smart Shopper App is designed to simplify food shopping for people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The mobile app operates in the most simple manner – scan the bar code of an item in the store and we’ll provide a simple, clear message letting you know if that item is a healthy option for people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Using the iconic red, yellow, green stoplight color palette, we’ll provide straight-forward guidance on each item you scan:
Considering a loaf of white bread? That’s a big red NO! We’ll send you this simple message: “White bread is high in processed sugar and has a high glycemic index.  Consider buying whole wheat bread or, even better, whole grain breads.”
What about pineapple? That’s a yellow light. “Pineapples are high in natural sugars. You can eat some pineapple but try adding high fiber fruits like apples to your basket as well.”
I love fish. How about the wild-caught salmon? Green light! “Wild caught salmon is an excellent source of high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals – and it’s loaded with healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Go for it!”

<p>Hello ,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Donald Castellano, some know me by my nickname D.J. and here’s my story. Originally married in 1997 at the young age of 17 , over the course of 8 years being a father to five beautiful children I knew life would be full of adventure and hard work ahead to support these children. Working a single job still wasn’t enough to support the family, devastatingly only to end in a divorce in 2007 due to irreconcilable differences. Going our separate ways and allowing her to have the children fulltime while I worked, still getting nowhere in life, I decided to continue my education I originally started before my marriage in 1996.</p>
<p>                While attending school during the daytime (Criminal Justice degree), I also attended night time schooling on my days off (Business &amp; Management degree) to complete it in 2009. I was super proud of finally getting somewhere in life ,being successful towards my children’s future and well being that I decided to take my Criminal Justice degree even further. Moving from one school to the next (due to capacity of finishing an A.S to a B.S.), I stayed steady pursuing my dreams of being a CSI Forensic Examiner for Department of Homeland Security. I knew I would be a big role model to my children, to look up to and wonder why I pursued what I did in matters of my family’s Law Enforcement history. To cherish and be passionate about everything I loved doing, serving the community, protecting their safety, teaching right from wrong while protecting the States from terrorist activities, to say the least, I was there.</p>
<p>                Till one day I got a phone call from my oldest daughter, Hailey’s teacher. Walking into the room I was in shock to see their Mothers new Mother-In-Law, teacher &amp; State Case Worker all at the table. I was in awe, confused and distracted of my children being in harm’s way. The time I had spent trying to become a better father through education, paying my Child Support &amp; becoming a better role model, was the time that they were being hurt… Physically, emotional and traumatically, the living conditions they were in were horrid. The reports were novels long, lice infested hair, loss of weight due to starvation, abuse marks found on them from the nurse but no notification to me from the school. Their mother had kept it all a secret only to fuel herself of addictive habits with the child support &amp; food stamps she received from the State of Florida for over 2 ½ years. A change had to come, this couldn’t be happening to my children.</p>
<p>                With the help of the State of Florida, I was awarded <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">FULL CUSTODY</span> in Early 2010 of all FIVE children miraculously. Something rarely unheard of, being a REAL father and taking the stand of both role models with inspirational outlooks, I was in for a longer road ahead. Devastatingly that year, June 2010, I took two HUGE blows to my family. 1) We lost a most wonderful cousin, whom was a State Trooper for the State of New Jersey which in turn 2) Caused me to lose my job, of being on Bereavement, to return to work early since my mother flew to New Jersey instead of me. I was in shock, in denial that this was happening the way it was in such a moment in my life of turmoil and disbelief, it couldn’t be.</p>
<p>                I took charge, liquidating all of my assets, focusing on raising my children the correct way and getting them back on track since they missed quite a few months of schooling and some. I took a leave of absence with my Bachelors degree at my current University with only a year left, the children needed me the most at this critical timing of their lives.  Three of my children were left back that year in school; my oldest daughters THIRD time being left back almost in a row due to lack of education and attendance being her main problematic area. Additional tutoring after school from myself, additional therapists twice a week ordered for them , family group counseling with the six of us over the course of a couple years was in place and last but not least speech therapy for two of my children due to problematic issues while growing up that was not addressed. They were progressing, F’s,D’s to C’s and up to their current point now of being Honor Roll students, the hard work was paying off. They were creative, developing stories for school that were amazing, awards brought home for best effort and dedication in anything they did, it was a priceless.</p>
<p>                Around the middle of 2011, I started becoming fatigued and in pain. Already bearing a <strong>single solitary kidney</strong>, always taking good care of my health already, something was wrong for this to happen. I went to my Primary Health Physician to be immediately rushed to the hospital due to high blood pressure. 200+/150+ at first it started… The pain was unbearable; they placed me on one blood pressure medication, only to temporarily work while figuring out what’s going on. Going to a Urologist, Nephrologist to Gastrologist, test after test, it seemed hopeless for a few months. Within a six month time period my Primary Care Physician placed me on 3 different types of blood pressure medications only to refer me to a pain management, since the blood pressure medications weren’t totally fixing the problem. 5 medications in total it took for my blood pressure to come back to somewhat a normal range and out of the stroke(<strong>or even death</strong>) levels they were at for months straight on end.</p>
<p>                I thought it was over, 6 months straight of tests and no resolution but medications that I would have to take for possibly the rest of my life, only being 31 now, it would be a long time. I had already visited the E.R. <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">17 times at this point</span></strong>, becoming frequent even with the Doctors in the Emergency section alone! Finally finding out what was going on, my Gastrologist had the results. February 2012 I had undergone a Colonoscopy to find out I had a tight, kinked bowel at the hepatic flexure with possible hernia also developing. This was serious, the tests I have been through and also finding out I have kidney stones again (Third time in 10 months) the pain totally is almost indescribable.  2 months into taking my increase in bp meds, my blood pressure started rising, I returned back to my Primary Care once again. </p>
<p>                Upon multiple visits and tests again with the new specialist, the doctor declined to do surgery as a resolution on this matter. I don’t smoke, drink or use drugs but still stated due to the onset of the illness it was more of a risk then benefit. Due to the fact of me having a solitary kidney, this MIGHT HAVE BEEN the reason I had the kinked bowel problem. Too much of a “Maybe” was the results of everything and from the inconsistency of the problem the responsibility of surgeon, I was turned down. UNBELIEVABLE…</p>
<p>                This is where we are today, the present day and why I ask for your help. I am in desperate need for assistance so I can get back to doing what I do best, raising my children. I am sick and tired of being sick and tired, there has to be hope out to the public. I have no insurance,noone else to care for my children and therefore it seems where I need to be is what I cannot afford. I have given everything I earned since my childhood to my children, to help them be where they are today only to be stuck at a dead end with my health at a steady declining rate. I have nothing left to give to proceed at this point, so I am hoping for a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">miracle</span>. Your donations will be used to help support my health issues in the following way:</p>
<p>1)      Travel costs to a recommended specialist for our Third opinion, consultation and quite possibly surgery as needed.</p>
<p>2)      Medical costs for the doctor’s services</p>
<p>3)       Caregiver assistance for my children during the 2-4 months downtime</p>
<p>4)      Any bills accumulated during the period in medical care</p>
<p>5)      Lodging expenses during the time period near the doctor’s offices</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your help is greatly appreciated; me and my children have a lot of love to give. They have always been taught with manners, respect and to give better than receive. If you cannot donate for the cause, please share also! Use the fantastic sharing tools that Indiegogo has to offer. Sharing is the best love anyone can have and we have a lot of it. We appreciate anything that you have to offer by just being, yourself. Talking over with my children, we thought of many ways to pay the community with the funds we receive and would go as follows. We created a Facebook page due to the criticalness of my health for daily updates which your name would be placed as a memorabilia from helping us. Also higher donors would be compensated an autographed picture in the donating range stated above, last but not least a PERSONAL card/drawing from us to you, thanking for supporting us in this timing. We hope you enjoy the perks as I am always fascinated as the artistic incline my children provide in drawings to me, directly from their heart. Please keep in contact with me and the children, we love SUPPORT also! Thank you and God bless!</p>

Now Tim is in a different kind of struggle.<br/>   <br/>In August 2012 he was diagnosed with high grade, aggressive Stage IV prostate cancer. <br/><br/>Although the cancer had advanced beyond surgical intervention, in retrospect, this was perhaps a blessing. With no urgency for surgery, and because radiation treatments were not yet planned, we recovered from the news and immediately began learning everything we could about prostate cancer, as well as conventional, complementary and alternative treatments.<br/><br/>We learned that his provincial and employer-paid health plans will only pay for invasive or toxic treatments like surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, but we also learned that there are many non-toxic treatments that treat cancer as the systemic disease that it is. Unfortunately, insurance does not cover such holistic treatments and they must be paid out-of-pocket.</p>
<p>Tim has therefore chosen a path to healing that is non-toxic and supportive of the body, mind and spirit. In April he will travel to Germany, where a 'freedom of treatment' law will give him access to treatments that are either unavailable or more expensive in Canada and the U.S.. His goal with these treatments and subsequent followup is to be declared ""cancer free"" by August 2013.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when he told his physician here in Vancouver that he first wanted to pursue the alternative holistic, and non-toxic treatment plan, his doctor became visibly agitated and rude. He said there was no place for alternative medicine in cancer and dismissed Tim's six months of research on conventional and alternative methods as ""foolish"" and ""idiotic"". He refused to monitor Tim's progress with alternative treatments unless Tim agreed to go down the recommended path of radiation and chemo. In so doing, his doctor revealed his narrow-minded focus on just treating the prostate, rather than the whole person. Cancer is not an isolated disease but a systemic one and must be treated as such.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Tim remains undaunted. He has proven his mettle as a man committed to ending injustices visited upon vulnerable groups. When presented by the personal challenge of cancer, he's shown to me and his friends that he's up to that challenge. Many of you will agree with me when I say that we can't afford to lose such a valuable champion for human rights.<br/><br/>The full cost of treatments, testing, airfare, food and lodging will approach $18,000.

Now Tim is in a different kind of struggle.   In August 2012 he was diagnosed with high grade, aggressive Stage IV prostate cancer. Although the cancer had advanced beyond surgical intervention, in retrospect, this was perhaps a blessing. With no urgency for surgery, and because radiation treatments were not yet planned, we recovered from the news and immediately began learning everything we could about prostate cancer, as well as conventional, complementary and alternative treatments.We learned that his provincial and employer-paid health plans will only pay for invasive or toxic treatments like surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, but we also learned that there are many non-toxic treatments that treat cancer as the systemic disease that it is. Unfortunately, insurance does not cover such holistic treatments and they must be paid out-of-pocket.
Tim has therefore chosen a path to healing that is non-toxic and supportive of the body, mind and spirit. In April he will travel to Germany, where a 'freedom of treatment' law will give him access to treatments that are either unavailable or more expensive in Canada and the U.S.. His goal with these treatments and subsequent followup is to be declared ""cancer free"" by August 2013.
Unfortunately, when he told his physician here in Vancouver that he first wanted to pursue the alternative holistic, and non-toxic treatment plan, his doctor became visibly agitated and rude. He said there was no place for alternative medicine in cancer and dismissed Tim's six months of research on conventional and alternative methods as ""foolish"" and ""idiotic"". He refused to monitor Tim's progress with alternative treatments unless Tim agreed to go down the recommended path of radiation and chemo. In so doing, his doctor revealed his narrow-minded focus on just treating the prostate, rather than the whole person. Cancer is not an isolated disease but a systemic one and must be treated as such.
Tim remains undaunted. He has proven his mettle as a man committed to ending injustices visited upon vulnerable groups. When presented by the personal challenge of cancer, he's shown to me and his friends that he's up to that challenge. Many of you will agree with me when I say that we can't afford to lose such a valuable champion for human rights.The full cost of treatments, testing, airfare, food and lodging will approach $18,000. After having pre-paid for our travel and accommodations,  the treatments and tests over a three-week period will amount to $12,000.
I know Tim has never been shy about asking for money for human rights causes, but he'd never ask for such support for himself. That's why his friends and I, his husband, are making this appeal for your support on his behalf. We believe now is the time for those of us who love Tim, and who appreciate all the good work he's done for others, to rally to his side.

<h3>THE NEVADA SENIOR GAMES NEEDS A FINANCIAL HAND</h3>
<p>My name is David Rosinsky, and I am just reaching my 60th birthday this coming April.  I graduated from Niagara University in Upstate New York, with a degree in Physical Education, and enjoyed a youthful athletic background in competitive swimming, volleyball, and crew. Although I am older now, I am still very active in triathlon, swimming, cycling, running, volleyball, and other sports. </p>
<p>The State of Nevada Senior Olympic Games was a life saver for me, and gave me the opportunity to fulfill a life long dream of trying to be an Olympian like my swimming idol Mark Spitz, (my generation of Michael Phelps).</p>
<p>Ask most younger people, and they will tell you that after the age of 50, life is about lounging in a rocking chair on the front porch watching the world go by.</p>
<p>But for more and more people that reach that half century mark, the word active is the norm, and participation in the Senior Games is the program that thousands across the United States turn to to fulfill fitness dreams and goals.</p>
<p>The Senior Games is a national organization, with state programs of athletic competition for people over the age of 50 who wish to remain active, competitive, and aggressive in an athletic arena.  The workouts, the practices, and the games themselves are the fuel that keep us alive.</p>
<p>Every year the Nevada Senior Games holds an Olympic style event hosting over 20 different sports, with hundreds of competitors from all over the United States, as well as Russia, and other international contingents.  Competitors love coming to our games because...well after all it is Las Vegas.  Just like the other conventions and events that take place in Las Vegas, senior tourists also spend money in town at casinos, food establishments, and local shops, boosting our hard hit economy.</p>
<p>Although there are Senior Games events in many cities around Nevada, Las Vegas is the main city for qualifying for the National competitions that occur every two years.</p>
<p>We need financial help!</p>
<p>As the economy fell, so to have donations, sponsors, and other financial backers for our program.  The state program is operated almost entirely by volunteers, but expenses, such as venues, medals, and permits continue to require cash, and we are in trouble.</p>
<p>With out your help, we will have to cut back on the program, reduce the opportunities to keep our senior communities active, and watch as more and more of your parents, grandparents, and even great grand parents who love sports and athletics lose the program that keeps them alive.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>For the upcoming season and the games that have already starting, we need an immediate influx of $50,000.00 in donations.</p>
<p>Items such as golf course fees, shooting range fees, and swimming pool rentals along with the electronic timing equipment are all just some of the unavoidable expenses right off the top.  Participation registration fees are nominal, and do not even cover the tee shirts or medals awarded to the participants.</p>
<p>Even though the office space is donated, it comes with a caveat that requires an expenditure of capital though out the year.  Other office expenses, such as equipment and supplies seem to continue to climb beyond our reach.</p>
<p>Please be aware that <strong>No money</strong> is spent on race directors, event managers, or auxiliary support personell as they are all non-paid volunteers.</p>
<p>In the past, we have always relied on donations from the local community businesses to keep our goals and purpose within reach, but times have changed, and now we need your help to continue our important work.</p>
<p>Donate $25.00 and receive a copy of the beautiful results booklet that is sent out to all participating athletes, with an official thank you letter from the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Donate $50.00 and get a copy of the results booklet, and a letter and picture from a participating athlete, along with an official thank you letter from the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Donate $100.00 or more and get a copy of the CD highlighting a variety of events from the Las Vegas Senior Olympic Games, along with an official thank you letter from the Board of Directors.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without your help, the Nevada Senior Games in Las Vegas, after 32 years of providing services, may cease to exist.  Senior athletes will not have the venue to continue demonstrating that age 50 and over is just a number and not the end of life.</p>
<p>The Senior Games is a vital part of the world of the Olympic Games, the Special Olympics, the Para Olympic Games, and athletic competition starting from early childhood, through school, and on into professional sports.</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping the Olympic dream alive for thousands of seniors and their famlies.</p>

<p>It’s very simple; I love yoga for what it has done to my mind, body and soul.  I want to help others experience that same joy and transformation that I experienced in such a short period of time and share it with others.  </p>
<p>I started practicing yoga about a year ago and it has changed my life in such positive ways.  I finally began to love and respect my body like I have never thought I could.  I began seeing myself as independent, elegant and beautiful.  While the transformation was happening others began to view me in the same light I saw myself.  With this incredible response from friends and family I instantly knew that my life had been changed forever and that I must share this incredibly beautiful feeling with others and teach yoga as I was taught!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO WITH YOGA?</strong></p>
<p>I believe that if a single individual can transform so can a community.  Through a peaceful and loving environment with the given tools we can all become the creatures we are destined to be. Yoga is a powerful tool of transformation. It not only helps a person physically but the mental tranquility it offers is astonishing.</p>
<p>My goal as a yoga teacher will be to share this beautiful gift with others. Being able to teach yoga will allow me to contribute to another dimension of self exploration.</p>
<p>I also plan to volunteer as often as possible and use this to help any soul whose path I cross.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>
<p>I am blessed to be part of a beautiful studio called LEAP Yoga and will be taking part of the 200-hour yoga alliance certified teacher training. It begins January 3<sup>rd</sup> through March 24<sup>th</sup>. The entire training is $3000.00. They have been kind enough to allow a payment plan so I have a few months to make this dream happen! This has been quite the obstacle for me, but have decided to take a LEAP of faith and put this out into the Universe to see what will come of it.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO?</strong></p>
<p>Share my request with people you think may be interested in supporting my dream, wish upon a falling star, bargain with a leprechaun, buy a winning lottery ticket and send a few dollars my way while crossing your fingers and toes and then saying a few prayers and of course, please share what you can.</p>

Unexplained abdominal or pelvic pain
Difficulty eating or feeling full quickly
Needing to urinate often or urgently
Some women experience additional or different symptoms. You should let your doctor know if you have any other symptoms that are not usual for you these may include:
Changes in bowel habits
Unexplained weight loss or gain
Vaginal bleeding
Back pain
Indigestion or nausea
Excessive fatigue
Bloating
The majority of women who experience these early symptoms do not have cancer. However, it is important that you seek medical advice if the symptoms persist. IF YOU HAVE THE ABOVE SYMPTOMS FOR MORE THAN 2 WEEKS YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR GP.SurvivalEvery woman with ovarian cancer is treated as an individual case, depending on the stage of the disease and other personal factors. It is therefore very difficult to give a general prognosis.If the cancer is diagnosed and treated early, between 80-100% of patients will survive for more than five years. But only approximately 30% of women diagnosed at advanced stages will survive for more than five years. See 'How is Ovarian Cancer Treated?' for further information about survival rates.
The five year survival rate for Australian women with ovarian cancer is only about 40%
In comparison, the five year survival rate for breast cancer is about 88%
THERE IS NO SCREENING TEST FOR OVARIAN CANCER. A PAP TEST IS USED TO DETECT CERVICAL CANCER IT DOES NOT DE-TECT OVARIAN CANCER. THIS IS A COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING BY A LOT OF WOMEN AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE EDUCATE WOMEN ABOUT THIS.",0.0,2,"7 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Xmetrics is a wearable device that can be worn on the back of the head, extremely ergonomic and lightweight. Once clipped at goggles we can easily start swimming without having to worry about pushing any buttons: we wear it and forget to have it. Xmetrics records any single biomechanical parameters such as the number of strokes, time per lap, efficiency of your swimming technique and the quality of your flip turn providing a real time audio feedback via an earplug. </span></p>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thus, we can have the feedback directly while swimming without having to wait the end of the training session. After that, we can analyze and share with our friends or a professional coach our data out of the swimming pool throughout software and apps, developed for mobile devices and personal computer.

<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""My dreams just come true with Xmetrics. To train, to keep in shape but specially to swim. If I had had Xmetrics 14 years ago probably I would have won more, who knows. Anyway there is an Xmetrics for everyone, professional swimmers or people that just go to the pool once or twice a week. You can keep on audio feedback, you can improve your turns, count your strokes, you can have someone taking care of you every day and every meter. If you are like me and you swim in a big group is going to help you. It’s going to help your coach to improve your session. Instead if you go to the pool once or twice per week you can really enjoy swimming without worrying and wishing to have a coach. Now you have a coach, and his name is Xmetrics. So, don’t lose your time, try it.""</i></p>

Please add 20$ for shipping (only if you buy the product, not goggles string or swimcup!). VAT only if you are EU citizens</p>
<p></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-US""><b><u>Q: Where can I buy Xmetrics after the indiegogo
campaign?</u></b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"">A: You will be able to pre-order Xmetrics in our
webshop on our homepage: </span><a href=""http://www.xmetrics.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span lang=""EN-US"">www.xmetrics.it</span></a><span lang=""EN-US""> </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><b>Q: What kind of audio feedback can we receive?</b></u></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;"">A: There are essentially three different kind of feedbacks. The time (elapsed or total), number of laps (total, partial) and beeps. It is then up to you to combine these feedbacks. Beeps can be used to set your frequency rate or to provide an alert after a set time of laps or time. But you can do any advanced combination. For instace, if you are working on an interval training, such as 10x200 meters freestyle with a recovery time of 20 seconds each time, you can decide to hear your split time any 50 meters and total time any 200 meters and also a beep after the 20 seconds are gone..</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><b>Q: I don't want to use earplugs, what can I do?</b></u></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;"">A: Xmetrics is an activity tracker designed for swimmers with a real time audio feedback. You can decide to use it for recording your data and analyze them only at the end. In this case, simply remove the earplugs. You can also use any other kind of waterproof earplugs if you feel more comfortable.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><span lang=""EN-US""><b>Q: What about patents?</b></span></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"">A: Xmetrics technology about the combined usage of several sensors for tracking the performance of an athlete providing a feedback and the position itself of the device is patent pending. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><span lang=""EN-US""><b>Q: What shall I add in VAT?</b></span></u><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;"">A: We do though have to add 20% VAT for EU countries, for US residence there is only custom clearance managed with the shipping cost.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><span lang=""EN-US""><b>Q: How does Xmetrics measure strokes?</b></span></u></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;"">A: Strokes are detected by our algorithm that takes data from the sensors placed in the backhead. Basically, we use MEMS sensors that provides very accurate data. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><span lang=""EN-US""><b>Q: How does Xmetrics not to move on the goggles?</b></span></u></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;"">A: We studied any single device on the market to understand what should have been the best placement for the device. We know that ergonomy and stability are relevant as much as data analysis and we didn't want to produce a device that was moving: athletes should concentrate on swimming, not on fixing a device! So we came up with this specific solution: a silicon band in which you insert your goggles straps. The device is then attached directly to the band with a special closing system that prevent any kind of drag during your training.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><span lang=""EN-US""><b>Q: What is the sound quality like?</b></span></u></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;"">A: In this first version, you will hear audio feedback. The quality of these feedbacks is the same as a navi system for your car. We believe nobody will notice or appreciate if a feedback is given with a CD quality: it has to be clear, short, and useful.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><span lang=""EN-US""><b>Q: What about battery life?</b></span></u></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;"">A: Xmetrics  is designed to provide at least 6 hours of battery life when all sensors are in use. This means that regular users don't have to worry to recharge it any time. Since the device is waterproof and all electronics inside should fullfill very strict standard, it is not possible to replace the battery, which is expected to last for at least 3 years.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><span lang=""EN-US""><b>Q: Will Xmetrics work with my Smartphone, Smart
Watch or other Fitness Trackers?</b></span></u></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;"">A: Xmetrics will work with any Android Bluetooth certified smartphones and any iPhone/iPad. The support for Windows phone will come in a second moment. However, you can connect it to any PC/Mac using both the USB connection or the Bluetooth one. So far, we do not have a dedicated app for smart watches. Xmetrics should be able to connect to any
Bluetooth certified device. Some functions might not be useable.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6.0pt;""><u><span lang=""EN-US""><b>Q: Can I order multiple units on Indiegogo?</b></span></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"">A: We will have a pre-order webshop online, when
the Indiegogo campaign ends. You will easily be able to preorder there.  We
will provide a lower price for Indiegogo backers.</span></p>

<h1><b><i>La storia</i></b></h1>
<p><i>""Ciao, sono Andrea, cofondatore di </i><b>Xmetrics.</b></p>
<p><i>Sono stato anche io un nuotatore professionista e un allenatore di nuoto. E
durante questa mia esperienza, ho sempre trovato molto difficile monitore le
mie prestazioni e quelle dei miei atleti in maniera precisa e automatica
durante l’allenamento in una piscina caotica.</i></p>
<p><i>Le ho provate di tutte, ogni singolo dispositivo sul mercato, per provare a
risolvere questo problema: alcuni si muovevano sul mio polso, altri non erano
in grado di rilevare tutti i parametri necessari..</i></p>
<p><i><i>Io volevo qualcosa di più di un comune contavasche. Volevo un coach
virtuale.</i><br/></i></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/989726/files/20141105161944-piscina_confusione.png?1415233184"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>""Per questo motivo ho deciso di affidarmi al mio background di
ingegnere elettronico, ho assoldato i miei amici ed insieme abbiamo iniziato a
lavorare ad una soluzione. Ho passato tanto tempo con Davide, mio compagno di
studi, per brevettare il dispositivo.</i></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Il team  quindi iniziato a crescere
per realizzare il primo prototipo funzionante per raccogliere dati da quegli
stessi atleti che allenavo fino a poco tempo prima. Emanuele e Stefano si sono
aggiunti per occuparsi della parte di design elettronico e di sviluppo del
firmware, mentre Francesco, ultimo in ordine di tempo, ha portato nella squadra
le suoe competenze di marketing acquisite in anni da dirigente in una
multinazionale.</i></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Chiunque ci diceva che fosse impossibile creare un dispositivo che fosse
facile da usare ,comodo da indossare e sufficientemente potente da fare tutto
quello che avevamo intenzione facesse.</i></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Si erano sbagliati.</i></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Ci sono voluti diversi mesi, ma adesso sono fiero di dire che abbiamo
creato il più avanzato dispositivo tecnologico per il nuoto esistente.</i></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Permettetemi di presentarvi Xmetrics. E’ studiato appositamente per
registrare ogni aspetto del tuo allenamento, dal numero delle bracciate a
quello delle vasche, la qualità della tua virata e della tua nuotata e molto
altro ancora.</i></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Ma non ci siamo fermati qui: questo dispositivo fornisce anche un feedback
audio realtime attraverso gli auricolari direttamente durante l’allenamento. In
questo modo non dovrai più aspettare la fine del tuo allenamento per sapere che
cosa hai fatto.</i></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Il nostro desiderio era di innovare completamente il modo in cui ognuno di
noi si allena. </i></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><b><i>E insieme, lo abbiamo fatto.</i></b><i>”</i></p>

<p><b>Xmetrics</b> è il primo dispositivo
indossabile al mondo studiato appositamente per gli atleti, professionisti o
amatoriali e per i loro allenatori per monitorare al meglio le proprie
prestazioni durante l’allenamento.</p>

Si
tratta di un sistema estremamente facile e comodo da indossare, che si aggancia
in maniera estremamente intuitiva agli elastici degli occhialini. Una volta
indossato, non rimane da far altro che nuotare, senza dover preoccuparsi di
schiacciare alcun pulsante. Il dispositivo andrà a raccogliere automaticamente
una serie di parametri biomeccanici relativi all’allenamento, quali il numero
di bracciate, l’efficienza della nuotata, il numero di vasche, il tempo per
vasca, la velocità di rotazione della virata e l’accelerazione della spinta, lo
stile nuotato. L’atleta potrà sentire in tempo reale, senza dove uscire dalla
vasca, alcuni feedback audio come per esempio il tempo (“2 vasche, 32.4
secondi”) o addirittura feedback più evoluti come per esempio impostare con un
beep la frequenza di bracciata<br/><h1 style=""display: inline !important;""><b><i><div><h1 style=""display: inline !important;""><b><i><br/></i></b></h1></div>Vantaggi</i></b></h1>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span style=""font-size: 36px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 40px;""><b></b><p style=""font-style: italic;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/989732/files/20141105162341-benefits_2.1_NO_TITLE.png?1415233421"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Feedback audio Real Time: </b>Grazie alla sua innovativa posizione sul
retro della testa è ora possibile dare un feedback audio real time all’atleta
direttamente durante l’allenamento ad ogni virata o pausa dell’allenamento. </p>
<p><b>Posizione sul retro della testa: </b>E’ la prima
volta che un dispositivo per monitora le prestazione dell’atleta è posizionato
dietro la testa. E’ provato scientificamente che questa sia la posizione
migliore per raccogliere più parametri e più affidabili. Inoltre gli atleti non
si devono preoccupare di null’altro se non nuotare: niente pulsanti da
schiacciare o cambiamenti nel loro gesto tecnico per guardare dei display; niente orologi che si muovono e danno
fastidio durante l’allenamento.</p>
<p><b>Programmazione degli
allenamenti: </b>I nuotatori o i loro coach possono programmare gli
allenamenti con Xmetrics App e sincronizzarli direttamente con il dispositivo.
In questo modo è possibile personalizzare a seconda delle esigenze personali il
feedback audio che si sente. Per esempio, un atleta può decidere di sentire un
solo beep durante i primi 10 minuti di riscaldamento oppure di sentire ogni 2
vasche il tempo intermedio. Ma è possibile fornire feedback anche molto più
evoluti sfruttando anche la funzione metronomo per segnalare il passo.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><b>Analisi dati avanzata:</b> Oltre ai dati sul numero di vasche,
bracciate o al cronometro automatico i nuotatori possono analizzare nel
dettaglio i parametri dell’allenamento alla fine della loro sessione. Tra le
analisi più dettagliate troviamo per esempio lo studio della  virata, dove vengono separati i movimenti di
avvicinamento, rotazione e spinta e calcolati in maniera quantitativa,
qualitativa e statistica l’efficienza dei singoli. Infine è possibile
condividere i propri dati con gli amici sui vari social, potendo fare gare
virtuali con gli stessi.</p>

</h1>
</div>
<p><b><u>D: Come posso contattare Xmetrics?</u></b></p>
<p>R: Potete usare l’indirizzo info@xmetrics.it. Vi risponderemo al più
presto possibile.</p>
<p><b><u>D: Devo aggiungere le tasse al totale</u></b></p>
<p>Si, le tasse vanno aggiunte a parte a seconda del luogo di provenienza.
Ricordatevi inoltre di aggiungere 20$ per la spedizione (solo nel caso
compriate il prodotto!). L’IVA (VAT) va aggiunta solo per i cittadini EU</p>
<p><b><u>D: Che tipo di feedback si ricevono?</u></b></p>
<p>Ci sono essenzialmente 3 tipi di feedback. Il tempo (parziale o totale), il
numero delle vasche (totale o parziale) e i segnali sonori (bip). E’ poi
facoltà del singolo utilizzatore combinare questi feedback., I Bip possono
inoltre essere usati per impostare la tua frequenza di bracciata (funzione
metronomo) o per darti un allarme dopo un certo numero di vasche o di tempo. Ma
potete utilizzare ogni qualsiasi combinazione più avanzata. Per esempio, se
stai facendo un esercizio con delle partenze specifiche, per esempio 10x200m
con una ripertenza ogni 3’, puoi avere i passaggi ogni 2 vasche, il totale al
termine del 200m e la ripartenza ogni 3’, cosi come puoi sentire per i primi 10
secondi di ogni 50 metri la frequenza della tua bracciata desiderata.</p>
<p><b><u>D: Non voglio usare auricolare, che cosa posso fare?</u></b></p>
<p>Xmetrics è un activity tracker progettato per i nuotatori che fornisce un
feedback audio. Ma qualora decidessi di rinunciare a questa funzionalità, ti
raccoglie comunque tutti i dati per permetterti di analizzarli in un secondo
momento. Nel caso fossi affezionato ad altri tipi di auricolari waterproof,
puoi tranquillamente utilizzarli al posto di quelli forniti in dotazione.</p>
<p><b><u>D: Ci sono dei brevetti?</u></b></p>
<p>La tecnologia di Xmetrics è
basata sull’utilizzo combinato di vari sensori per tracciare le prestazioni di
un atleta fornendo un riscontro audio in diretta. Abbiamo depositato per questo
motive domanda di brevetto.</p>
<p><b><u>D: Come fa Xmetrics a misurare le bracciate?</u></b></p>
<p>Le bracciate sono determinate da un algoritmo che riceve i dati dai sensori
posti sul retro del capo. L’interpretazione di questi dati è possibile grazie
alla accuratezza con i quali vengono rilevati grazie alla posizione specifica.</p>
<p><b><u>D: Come è possibile che Xmetrics non si muove sugli
occhialini?</u></b></p>
<p>Abbiamo studiato ogni dispositivo sul mercato per capire quale potesse
essere il miglior posizionamento. Sappiamo che l’ergonomia e la stabilità sono
importanti tanto quanto i dati e le analisi disponibili e non volevamo produrre
un dispositivo che si muovesse durante l’utilizzo: gli atleti devono rimanere
concentrati senza distrazioni sulla loro nuotata, dimenticandosi di avere
Xmetrics addosso. La nostra soluzione è stata di utilizzare una band siliconica
da fissare agli occhialini a cui agganciare con un attacco a baionetta il
dispositivo, prevenendo in questo modo ogni movimento non previsto.</p>
<p><b><u>D: Qual è la qualità del suono?</u></b></p>
<p>In questa prima versione, si ascolteranno dei feedback audio. Questa
qualità è la stessa dei sistemi di navigazione per la macchina. </p>
<p><b><u>D: Qual è la durata prevista per la batteria?</u></b></p>
<p>Xmetrics è studioto per fornire almeno 6 ore di utilizzo quando tutti i
sensori sono accesi. Questo significa che per un uso regolare, non ci si debba
preoccupare di arrivare a metà sessione di allenamento con le batterie
scariche. Dal momento che tutto il dispositivo deve essere completamente
impermeabile non è possibile sostituire in autonomia la batteria, che durerà
almeno per 3 anni.</p>
<p><b><u>D: Il mio Xmetrics funzionerà con il mio Smartphone,
smartwatch o altro?</u></b></p>
<p>Xmetrics funziona con qualsiasi dispositivo Android certificato Bluetooth e
qualsiasi prodotto Apple. Il supporto per Windows phone seguirà immediatamente
dopo. Comunque sia, sarà possibile collegare tramite USB il dispositivo ad ogni
PC/MAC, come alternativa alla connessione BT. Al momento non è prevista una app
specifica per smartwatch e pertanto alcune funzioni potrebbero non essere
disponibili.</p>

</div></div>","(Il testo in Italiano dopo la parte in inglese)Swimmers' dream is to have an easy to use device to keep tracks of their erformance, such as laps, time count, frequency monitoring etc.With Xmetrics this dream comes to reality: fixed at your goggles, just on the back of your head, it provides a customizable real time audio feedback directly while swimming.


""Hi I'm Andrea cofounder of Xmetrics.As former professional swimmer and swim coach, I always found it extremely difficult to monitor the performance of myself and my athletes in an accurate and automatic way while training in a chaotic swimming pool.I’ve literally tried every existing device on the market to help solve this problem but they all fell short by either moving around on my wrist, not providing biological data, not measuring efficiency …etcI wanted something more than a lap counter. I wanted a virtual coach!""So I decided to take my electronics background, recruited some of my like minded geeky friends and started working on a solution. I had to work a lot on that with Davide, who graduated in Telecommunication Engineer with me, to patent the device.The team then started to grow to realize the first working prototype, to collect data data from the same athletes I was coaching few months before : Emanuele and Stefano jumped in the boat to take care of the hardware and firmware development. Francesco was the last one to join the project, in order to carry on his marketing experience he developed in years as marketing manager in a multinational company. Everyone told us it was going to be impossible to create a device that was easy to use, comfortable to wear, and powerful enough to do everything we wanted.  They were wrong.It took us several months , but I am pleased to say  we have created the most advanced piece of swimming technology on the planet.Allow me to introduce you to Xmetrics, it’s engineered to record all aspects of your  training session including number of strokes, number of laps, quality of your flipturn, your heart rate and more.  But we didn’t stop there, this device also provides real time audio feedback through our waterproof speaker directly to you while swimming.  That’s right, you no longer have to wait to get out of the pool to see results.  Our desire was to completely innovate the way you master your swimming training sessions.And together, we made it.""Andrea


Xmetrics is a wearable device that can be worn on the back of the head, extremely ergonomic and lightweight. Once clipped at goggles we can easily start swimming without having to worry about pushing any buttons: we wear it and forget to have it. Xmetrics records any single biomechanical parameters such as the number of strokes, time per lap, efficiency of your swimming technique and the quality of your flip turn providing a real time audio feedback via an earplug. 
Thus, we can have the feedback directly while swimming without having to wait the end of the training session. After that, we can analyze and share with our friends or a professional coach our data out of the swimming pool throughout software and apps, developed for mobile devices and personal computer. Xmetrics is our personal trainer who will follow us in every step of our workout activity.Xmetrics is open to all swimmers, professional or not, who wish to enhance their training experience in the swimming pool.Real time audio feedback: thanks to its innovative position is now possible to give a real time audio feedback directly while swimming through an earplug any time they make a flip turn or they stop swimming.Back head position: this is the first time that an activity tracker for swimmers is positioned on the back of the head: and this is the best position to gather more and more accurate swimming data. In addition, swimmers aren't bothered by anything that drags on their wrist or fixed in uncomfortable position.Programmable training: swimmers can program their training schedule on the Xmetrics App and Sync it with their device. In this way swimmers can customize according to specific needs the audio feedback. For instance, swimmers can decide to hear only a beep during the first 10 minutes warm up or time per lap any two laps. For more examples on audio feedback, please read our FAQs.Advance data analysis: along with data about number laps/strokes/turns automatic stopwatch, swimmers can analyze in detail their training parameters at the end of the training session. The software will provide accurate and easy to read analysis. Swimmers can have a further feedback sharing these data with coach or friends.

Xmetrics is not only an activity tracker but also a powerful software that  gives you the possibility to analyze your training data after your training session. Anything is shown in a very easy to use way. Swimmers can customize their view in order to have always under control the parameters they need most.Moreover, we have developed a specific tool, that we are providing to swim coaches for free to manage in any single aspect their teams: from the monthly to the weekly and daily schedule of the trainings, with a full detail and recap of any different kind of works proposed. In this way they can keep records of any group or single athlete they are coaching, withouth worrying of losing data. Once the training is done, data from the swimmers is automatically shown also on the coaches app.Xmetrics will be launched along with an app, free to use with you iOS/Android/Windows mobile operating system.Based on our experience as swimmers we have decided to develop two different products: Xmetrics PRO, for professional swimmers and their coaches that need to master their training session and Xmetrics FIT, the perfect and affordable device that brings the experience of an olympic training system for everyone.Xmetrics FIT provides a real time audio feedback at fixed intervals, it tracks laps, strokes, times, swim efficiency and it comes with a multiplatform app to review, analyze and share through the social networks your data.Xmetrics PRO provides, in addition, a fully customizable audio feedback; possibility to share and review data with your coach or a professional coach; get a training schedule directly on your App/page and sync it to your device by a professional coach or your coach as well; more views for data analysis; more colors to customize your device.* Products may be subject to minor changes in the engineering phase






""My dreams just come true with Xmetrics. To train, to keep in shape but specially to swim. If I had had Xmetrics 14 years ago probably I would have won more, who knows. Anyway there is an Xmetrics for everyone, professional swimmers or people that just go to the pool once or twice a week. You can keep on audio feedback, you can improve your turns, count your strokes, you can have someone taking care of you every day and every meter. If you are like me and you swim in a big group is going to help you. It’s going to help your coach to improve your session. Instead if you go to the pool once or twice per week you can really enjoy swimming without worrying and wishing to have a coach. Now you have a coach, and his name is Xmetrics. So, don’t lose your time, try it.""

We need funding to finalize the industrialization of the product and having first fully working beta samples.
With the stretch goals we would like to reach, our target is to start working on the new generation of Xmetrics, to enrich the training experience of more users (open water for instance).




















Q: How can I contact Xmetrics?
A: You can use this email address: info@xmetrics.it; we will reply you as soon as we can.
Q: Do I have to add taxes and shipping cost to my perk?
Yes, you have. Please add 20$ for shipping (only if you buy the product, not goggles string or swimcup!). VAT only if you are EU citizens

Q: Where can I buy Xmetrics after the indiegogo
campaign?
A: You will be able to pre-order Xmetrics in our
webshop on our homepage: www.xmetrics.it 
Q: What kind of audio feedback can we receive?
A: There are essentially three different kind of feedbacks. The time (elapsed or total), number of laps (total, partial) and beeps. It is then up to you to combine these feedbacks. Beeps can be used to set your frequency rate or to provide an alert after a set time of laps or time. But you can do any advanced combination. For instace, if you are working on an interval training, such as 10x200 meters freestyle with a recovery time of 20 seconds each time, you can decide to hear your split time any 50 meters and total time any 200 meters and also a beep after the 20 seconds are gone..
Q: I don't want to use earplugs, what can I do?
A: Xmetrics is an activity tracker designed for swimmers with a real time audio feedback. You can decide to use it for recording your data and analyze them only at the end. In this case, simply remove the earplugs. You can also use any other kind of waterproof earplugs if you feel more comfortable.
Q: What about patents?
A: Xmetrics technology about the combined usage of several sensors for tracking the performance of an athlete providing a feedback and the position itself of the device is patent pending. 
Q: What shall I add in shipping cost?
A: We will ship directly from Italy, so please add the shipping cost as indicated in our perks. If
you are an EU/US resident, please add the shipping cost mentioned in the
perk.
Q: What shall I add in VAT?
A: We do though have to add 20% VAT for EU countries, for US residence there is only custom clearance managed with the shipping cost.
Q: How does Xmetrics measure strokes?
A: Strokes are detected by our algorithm that takes data from the sensors placed in the backhead. Basically, we use MEMS sensors that provides very accurate data. 
Q: How does Xmetrics not to move on the goggles?
A: We studied any single device on the market to understand what should have been the best placement for the device. We know that ergonomy and stability are relevant as much as data analysis and we didn't want to produce a device that was moving: athletes should concentrate on swimming, not on fixing a device! So we came up with this specific solution: a silicon band in which you insert your goggles straps. The device is then attached directly to the band with a special closing system that prevent any kind of drag during your training.
Q: What is the sound quality like?
A: In this first version, you will hear audio feedback. The quality of these feedbacks is the same as a navi system for your car. We believe nobody will notice or appreciate if a feedback is given with a CD quality: it has to be clear, short, and useful.
Q: What about battery life?
A: Xmetrics  is designed to provide at least 6 hours of battery life when all sensors are in use. This means that regular users don't have to worry to recharge it any time. Since the device is waterproof and all electronics inside should fullfill very strict standard, it is not possible to replace the battery, which is expected to last for at least 3 years.
Q: Will Xmetrics work with my Smartphone, Smart
Watch or other Fitness Trackers?
A: Xmetrics will work with any Android Bluetooth certified smartphones and any iPhone/iPad. The support for Windows phone will come in a second moment. However, you can connect it to any PC/Mac using both the USB connection or the Bluetooth one. So far, we do not have a dedicated app for smart watches. Xmetrics should be able to connect to any
Bluetooth certified device. Some functions might not be useable.
Q: Can I order multiple units on Indiegogo?
A: We will have a pre-order webshop online, when
the Indiegogo campaign ends. You will easily be able to preorder there.  We
will provide a lower price for Indiegogo backers.

Il primo activity
tracker del mondo per i nuotatori. Feedback audio realtime e analisi dei dati
biomeccanici

Milan, ItalyTechnology
Il sogno di ogni nuotatore è di avere un dispositivo facile da usare in
grado di tener traccia delle proprie prestazioni in acqua, come per esempio
delle vasche fatte, il tempo, la frequenza di bracciata..
Xmetrics è in grado di realizzare questo sogno: fissato agli occhialini sul
retro della testa, fornisce un feedback audio personalizzabile direttamente
durante la tua nuotata.




La storia
""Ciao, sono Andrea, cofondatore di Xmetrics.
Sono stato anche io un nuotatore professionista e un allenatore di nuoto. E
durante questa mia esperienza, ho sempre trovato molto difficile monitore le
mie prestazioni e quelle dei miei atleti in maniera precisa e automatica
durante l’allenamento in una piscina caotica.
Le ho provate di tutte, ogni singolo dispositivo sul mercato, per provare a
risolvere questo problema: alcuni si muovevano sul mio polso, altri non erano
in grado di rilevare tutti i parametri necessari..
Io volevo qualcosa di più di un comune contavasche. Volevo un coach
virtuale.


""Per questo motivo ho deciso di affidarmi al mio background di
ingegnere elettronico, ho assoldato i miei amici ed insieme abbiamo iniziato a
lavorare ad una soluzione. Ho passato tanto tempo con Davide, mio compagno di
studi, per brevettare il dispositivo.
Il team  quindi iniziato a crescere
per realizzare il primo prototipo funzionante per raccogliere dati da quegli
stessi atleti che allenavo fino a poco tempo prima. Emanuele e Stefano si sono
aggiunti per occuparsi della parte di design elettronico e di sviluppo del
firmware, mentre Francesco, ultimo in ordine di tempo, ha portato nella squadra
le suoe competenze di marketing acquisite in anni da dirigente in una
multinazionale.
Chiunque ci diceva che fosse impossibile creare un dispositivo che fosse
facile da usare ,comodo da indossare e sufficientemente potente da fare tutto
quello che avevamo intenzione facesse.
Si erano sbagliati.
Ci sono voluti diversi mesi, ma adesso sono fiero di dire che abbiamo
creato il più avanzato dispositivo tecnologico per il nuoto esistente.
Permettetemi di presentarvi Xmetrics. E’ studiato appositamente per
registrare ogni aspetto del tuo allenamento, dal numero delle bracciate a
quello delle vasche, la qualità della tua virata e della tua nuotata e molto
altro ancora.
Ma non ci siamo fermati qui: questo dispositivo fornisce anche un feedback
audio realtime attraverso gli auricolari direttamente durante l’allenamento. In
questo modo non dovrai più aspettare la fine del tuo allenamento per sapere che
cosa hai fatto.
Il nostro desiderio era di innovare completamente il modo in cui ognuno di
noi si allena. 
E insieme, lo abbiamo fatto.”
Andrea

Xmetrics


Xmetrics è il primo dispositivo
indossabile al mondo studiato appositamente per gli atleti, professionisti o
amatoriali e per i loro allenatori per monitorare al meglio le proprie
prestazioni durante l’allenamento.

Si
tratta di un sistema estremamente facile e comodo da indossare, che si aggancia
in maniera estremamente intuitiva agli elastici degli occhialini. Una volta
indossato, non rimane da far altro che nuotare, senza dover preoccuparsi di
schiacciare alcun pulsante. Il dispositivo andrà a raccogliere automaticamente
una serie di parametri biomeccanici relativi all’allenamento, quali il numero
di bracciate, l’efficienza della nuotata, il numero di vasche, il tempo per
vasca, la velocità di rotazione della virata e l’accelerazione della spinta, lo
stile nuotato. L’atleta potrà sentire in tempo reale, senza dove uscire dalla
vasca, alcuni feedback audio come per esempio il tempo (“2 vasche, 32.4
secondi”) o addirittura feedback più evoluti come per esempio impostare con un
beep la frequenza di bracciataVantaggi






Feedback audio Real Time: Grazie alla sua innovativa posizione sul
retro della testa è ora possibile dare un feedback audio real time all’atleta
direttamente durante l’allenamento ad ogni virata o pausa dell’allenamento. 
Posizione sul retro della testa: E’ la prima
volta che un dispositivo per monitora le prestazione dell’atleta è posizionato
dietro la testa. E’ provato scientificamente che questa sia la posizione
migliore per raccogliere più parametri e più affidabili. Inoltre gli atleti non
si devono preoccupare di null’altro se non nuotare: niente pulsanti da
schiacciare o cambiamenti nel loro gesto tecnico per guardare dei display; niente orologi che si muovono e danno
fastidio durante l’allenamento.
Programmazione degli
allenamenti: I nuotatori o i loro coach possono programmare gli
allenamenti con Xmetrics App e sincronizzarli direttamente con il dispositivo.
In questo modo è possibile personalizzare a seconda delle esigenze personali il
feedback audio che si sente. Per esempio, un atleta può decidere di sentire un
solo beep durante i primi 10 minuti di riscaldamento oppure di sentire ogni 2
vasche il tempo intermedio. Ma è possibile fornire feedback anche molto più
evoluti sfruttando anche la funzione metronomo per segnalare il passo.
Analisi dati avanzata: Oltre ai dati sul numero di vasche,
bracciate o al cronometro automatico i nuotatori possono analizzare nel
dettaglio i parametri dell’allenamento alla fine della loro sessione. Tra le
analisi più dettagliate troviamo per esempio lo studio della  virata, dove vengono separati i movimenti di
avvicinamento, rotazione e spinta e calcolati in maniera quantitativa,
qualitativa e statistica l’efficienza dei singoli. Infine è possibile
condividere i propri dati con gli amici sui vari social, potendo fare gare
virtuali con gli stessi.









Un activity tracker e un potente Software

Una volta finita la sessione di allenamento, Xmetrics si sincronizza automaticamente con il tablet, lo smartphone o il PC, fornendo una analisi dettagliata di tutto quanto successo in acqua. Il software è estremamente intuitivo nella sua grafica e permette di essere personalizzato in modo da mostrare sempre per primi i dati a cui si è maggiormente interessati.
Abbiamo inoltre sviluppato una applicazione specifica per gli allenatori in
modo da permettere loro di gestire in ogni aspetto gli allenamenti di una
squadra di nuoto, partendo dalla macroprogrammazione alla programmazione
settimana e giornaliera, personalizzando gli allenamenti per gruppi di atleti o
per atleti singoli. Questa applicazione, prima nel suo genere, sarà fornita
gratuitamente a tutti gli allenatori.

Versioni di
Xmetrics
Xmetrics è disponibile in 2
versioni: PRO, dedicato ai nuotatori avanzati e ai loro coach, che vogliono
avere sott’occhio ogni dettaglio dell’allenamento e richiedono analisi
estremamente puntuali e precise; FIT, dedicato invece agli amatori e a chi
vuole avere a disposizione uno strumento professionale per poter gestire e approfondire
i risultati dei propri allenamenti
Xmetrics FIT: fornisce un feedback audio real time a intervalli
prefissati, conta le vasche, bracciate, tempi, efficienza e qualità della
nuotata ed è fornito di una app multipiattaforma per analizzare e condividere
tramite social networks i risultati dell’allenamento

Xmetrics PRO: fornisce, in aggiunta,
un audio feedback completamente personalizzabile; è possibile per l’atleta
condividere i propri dati direttamente con il proprio coach o un coach
professionista; possibilità di ricevere sulla propria app un programma di
allenamenti e sincronizzarlo con il dispositivo; maggior numero di viste e di
analisi disponibili. Maggiori colori possibili.



Il Campione
Olimpico e Mondiale Massimiliano Rosolino parla di Xmetrcs

 
 
""I miei sogni si avverano con Xmetrics. Per allenarsi, per tenersi in
forma ma soprattutto, per nuotare. Se solo avessi avuto Xmetrics 14 anni
fa..magari avrei potuto vincere di piu, chi lo sa..Comunque sia, c’è un
Xmetrics per ognuno di noi, dal nuotatore professionista a chi va in piscina
semplicemente un paio di volte alla settimana per tenersi in forma. Potete
ascoltare degli audio feedback delle vostre prestazioni, potete migliorare le
vostre virate, contare le bracciate e valutarne l’efficienza, potete avere
qualcuno che si prenda cura dei vostri allenamenti ogni giorno e ogni metro che
percorrete. Se siete come me o se nuotate in un grande gruppo, Xmetrics vi
potrà tornare estrememente utile, supportando il vostro coach o molto più
semplicemente lasciandovi liberi di nuotare senza pensare a nulla. Ora anche
voi avete il vostro personal coach e il suo nome è Xmetrics. Non perdete tempo,
provatelo anche voi”
Massimiliano Rosolino, OCT 2014

Il nostro Team



F.A.Q.


D: Come posso contattare Xmetrics?
R: Potete usare l’indirizzo info@xmetrics.it. Vi risponderemo al più
presto possibile.
D: Devo aggiungere le tasse al totale
Si, le tasse vanno aggiunte a parte a seconda del luogo di provenienza.
Ricordatevi inoltre di aggiungere 20$ per la spedizione (solo nel caso
compriate il prodotto!). L’IVA (VAT) va aggiunta solo per i cittadini EU
D: Che tipo di feedback si ricevono?
Ci sono essenzialmente 3 tipi di feedback. Il tempo (parziale o totale), il
numero delle vasche (totale o parziale) e i segnali sonori (bip). E’ poi
facoltà del singolo utilizzatore combinare questi feedback., I Bip possono
inoltre essere usati per impostare la tua frequenza di bracciata (funzione
metronomo) o per darti un allarme dopo un certo numero di vasche o di tempo. Ma
potete utilizzare ogni qualsiasi combinazione più avanzata. Per esempio, se
stai facendo un esercizio con delle partenze specifiche, per esempio 10x200m
con una ripertenza ogni 3’, puoi avere i passaggi ogni 2 vasche, il totale al
termine del 200m e la ripartenza ogni 3’, cosi come puoi sentire per i primi 10
secondi di ogni 50 metri la frequenza della tua bracciata desiderata.
D: Non voglio usare auricolare, che cosa posso fare?
Xmetrics è un activity tracker progettato per i nuotatori che fornisce un
feedback audio. Ma qualora decidessi di rinunciare a questa funzionalità, ti
raccoglie comunque tutti i dati per permetterti di analizzarli in un secondo
momento. Nel caso fossi affezionato ad altri tipi di auricolari waterproof,
puoi tranquillamente utilizzarli al posto di quelli forniti in dotazione.
D: Ci sono dei brevetti?
La tecnologia di Xmetrics è
basata sull’utilizzo combinato di vari sensori per tracciare le prestazioni di
un atleta fornendo un riscontro audio in diretta. Abbiamo depositato per questo
motive domanda di brevetto.
D: Come fa Xmetrics a misurare le bracciate?
Le bracciate sono determinate da un algoritmo che riceve i dati dai sensori
posti sul retro del capo. L’interpretazione di questi dati è possibile grazie
alla accuratezza con i quali vengono rilevati grazie alla posizione specifica.
D: Come è possibile che Xmetrics non si muove sugli
occhialini?
Abbiamo studiato ogni dispositivo sul mercato per capire quale potesse
essere il miglior posizionamento. Sappiamo che l’ergonomia e la stabilità sono
importanti tanto quanto i dati e le analisi disponibili e non volevamo produrre
un dispositivo che si muovesse durante l’utilizzo: gli atleti devono rimanere
concentrati senza distrazioni sulla loro nuotata, dimenticandosi di avere
Xmetrics addosso. La nostra soluzione è stata di utilizzare una band siliconica
da fissare agli occhialini a cui agganciare con un attacco a baionetta il
dispositivo, prevenendo in questo modo ogni movimento non previsto.
D: Qual è la qualità del suono?
In questa prima versione, si ascolteranno dei feedback audio. Questa
qualità è la stessa dei sistemi di navigazione per la macchina. 
D: Qual è la durata prevista per la batteria?
Xmetrics è studioto per fornire almeno 6 ore di utilizzo quando tutti i
sensori sono accesi. Questo significa che per un uso regolare, non ci si debba
preoccupare di arrivare a metà sessione di allenamento con le batterie
scariche. Dal momento che tutto il dispositivo deve essere completamente
impermeabile non è possibile sostituire in autonomia la batteria, che durerà
almeno per 3 anni.
D: Il mio Xmetrics funzionerà con il mio Smartphone,
smartwatch o altro?
Xmetrics funziona con qualsiasi dispositivo Android certificato Bluetooth e
qualsiasi prodotto Apple. Il supporto per Windows phone seguirà immediatamente
dopo. Comunque sia, sarà possibile collegare tramite USB il dispositivo ad ogni
PC/MAC, come alternativa alla connessione BT. Al momento non è prevista una app
specifica per smartwatch e pertanto alcune funzioni potrebbero non essere
disponibili.",44.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Peggy. I am currently an non-traditional undergrad public health major in my final year at Rutgers in New Brunswick, NJ. I am currently enrolled in an International Public Health course, and would be thrilled if I am selected to participate in the annual Alternative Spring Break trip planned specifically for people who take this class...to see and learn about global public health first hand.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Nicaragua?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Two years ago, I had the opportunity to study abroad and remove myself from the US-centric bubble to learn more about health from a global perspective. It provided me with a little taste of what health looked like to the rest of the world as well as the desire to learn more. That's where this trip comes in.<br/></p>
<p>The class I took a few summers ago, while great, was all classroom work. This alternative spring break, set up by the fantastic people at Rutgers' H.O.P.E. (Health Outreach, Promotion, &amp; Education), gives students a chance to 'get their hands dirty,' and experience different aspects of the Nicaraguan health system. I would really love to take part in that experience, and see where it may lead me.</p>
<h3>Here's the break down:<br/>
</h3>
<p>The cost of this trip is $1800 (including airfare! Such a deal!) That price includes not just airfare, but:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>ground transport</li>
<li>lodging</li>
<li>food (breakfast &amp; dinner)</li>
<li>translator services</li>
<li>travel insurance</li>
</ul>
<div>The additional $200 will be used to cover any other travel costs-possible vaccines, etc.<p></p>
</div>
<p>If I reach my goal and exceed it, any additional donations will be used to purchase OTC medicines that the group will be carrying to Nicaragua. I have access to the company store for a large pharmaceutical company, which means I can get:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>100 Tylenol or Motrin tablets for $5</li>
<li>24 count box of Immodium AD for $3</li>
<li>8 oz Children's Benadryl for $5...</li>
</ul>
<div>The list goes on. This may not seem like much, but the clinics that are the recipients of these medications are grateful. According to the WHO, only 6.3% of Nicaragua's population is insured, and there are some extreme disparities in access to health care due to socioeconomic status, gender, geography, and ethnicity. We visit some of those places that have a lack of resources, and provide them what we can. I hope to be able to do my share in contributing.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we do:</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While we are in Nicaragua, we visit a number of different clinics, the US embassy, schools, etc. Here is a sample list of where this experience has taken students in the past:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Casa Maternas (Maternity Homes)</li>
<li>University of Nicaragua – Health Clinic</li>
<li>La Chureca – largest garbage dump in Latin America</li>
<li>Los Quinchos Program – which takes children off the streets and encourage them to get an education and a trade skill </li>
<li>Esperanza en Accion (Hope in Action) – fair trade organization</li>
<li>United States Embassy </li>
<li>Rural School</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What you get-the Perks!</h3>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>If you decide to donate, along with my extreme gratitude (and a thank you note!), I have a group of perks that might interest you...</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>For $10, along with my gratitude, you might just get a nifty landscape picture from my time in Nicaragua.</li>
<li>For $25, I will make sure you are on my list of people to send post cards to while in Nicaragua...I can't promise how legible they'll be (I understand the days are long), but I'll do my best.</li>
<li>For $50, along with a post card I will also pick up a small local gift for you, to be sent after I return.</li>
<li>For $100, I will send, along with everything else, a unique 2015 poster calendar using pictures from the trip...so you can see what we do when we are there, and know what day it is!</li>
<li>For $500, a few lucky people will receive something hand-knit by yours truly. This will be delivered post trip, and is in addition to those items listed above.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>If you are unable...</h3>
<p>Trust me, I get it. Times are tough. That's why I'm doing this campaign! If you find there is just no way you can contribute financially, I completely understand. If you would be willing to pass on the link to others (through FaceBook, the share tools here, etc), that would be awesome. If you have access to other things you think we may be able to utilize on the trip (condoms, other OTC medications, other medical supplies, etc), please let me know and we can see about donating that way. If you just want to send well-wishes, I'll take those, too (and they don't cost anything!) Either way, I am grateful for all and wish you all good health.</p></span></div>","Who am I?

(Health Outreach, Promotion, & Education), gives students a chance to 'get their hands dirty,' and experience different aspects of the Nicaraguan health system. I would really love to take part in that experience, and see where it may lead me.
Here's the break down:

The cost of this trip is $1800 (including airfare! Such a deal!) That price includes not just airfare, but:


ground transport
lodging
food (breakfast & dinner)
translator services
travel insurance

The additional $200 will be used to cover any other travel costs-possible vaccines, etc.

If I reach my goal and exceed it, any additional donations will be used to purchase OTC medicines that the group will be carrying to Nicaragua. I have access to the company store for a large pharmaceutical company, which means I can get:


100 Tylenol or Motrin tablets for $5
24 count box of Immodium AD for $3
8 oz Children's Benadryl for $5...

The list goes on. This may not seem like much, but the clinics that are the recipients of these medications are grateful. According to the WHO, only 6.3% of Nicaragua's population is insured, and there are some extreme disparities in access to health care due to socioeconomic status, gender, geography, and ethnicity. We visit some of those places that have a lack of resources, and provide them what we can. I hope to be able to do my share in contributing.

What we do:


While we are in Nicaragua, we visit a number of different clinics, the US embassy, schools, etc. Here is a sample list of where this experience has taken students in the past:


Casa Maternas (Maternity Homes)
University of Nicaragua – Health Clinic
La Chureca – largest garbage dump in Latin America
Los Quinchos Program – which takes children off the streets and encourage them to get an education and a trade skill 
Esperanza en Accion (Hope in Action) – fair trade organization
United States Embassy 
Rural School




What you get-the Perks!


If you decide to donate, along with my extreme gratitude (and a thank you note!), I have a group of perks that might interest you...


For $10, along with my gratitude, you might just get a nifty landscape picture from my time in Nicaragua.
For $25, I will make sure you are on my list of people to send post cards to while in Nicaragua...I can't promise how legible they'll be (I understand the days are long), but I'll do my best.
For $50, along with a post card I will also pick up a small local gift for you, to be sent after I return.
For $100, I will send, along with everything else, a unique 2015 poster calendar using pictures from the trip...so you can see what we do when we are there, and know what day it is!
For $500, a few lucky people will receive something hand-knit by yours truly. This will be delivered post trip, and is in addition to those items listed above.



If you are unable...
Trust me, I get it. Times are tough. That's why I'm doing this campaign! If you find there is just no way you can contribute financially, I completely understand. If you would be willing to pass on the link to others (through FaceBook, the share tools here, etc), that would be awesome. If you have access to other things you think we may be able to utilize on the trip (condoms, other OTC medications, other medical supplies, etc), please let me know and we can see about donating that way. If you just want to send well-wishes, I'll take those, too (and they don't cost anything!) Either way, I am grateful for all and wish you all good health.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Let's work together to make these rates public.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Jill Arnold. In 2005, I was thrilled to be pregnant with my first child. Toward the end of my healthy pregnancy, I was told I needed a cesarean because my baby was too big. As a curious first timer, I peppered my provider with questions about the risks of the cesarean and the risk of complications from attempting a vaginal delivery. To my great frustration, my requests for data were met only with anecdote and emotion.</p>
<p><br/>What exactly, if not medical evidence, lay behind that recommendation of cesarean? My blog, The Unnecesarean, began in 2008 to document my quest for the answer. The site eventually outgrew my personal exploration, my views shifted and I began investigating <strong><em>how patients and providers alike can benefit from shared decision-making—with access to information such as public reporting of hospital data, e.g. cesarean and vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) rates.</em></strong> The research on data reporting spawned a new site, <strong><a href=""http://www.cesareanrates.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""CesareanRates.com"">CesareanRates.com</a></strong>, which launched in February 2012.</p>
<p><br/>CesareanRates.com was well-received, logging more than 150,000 page views in its first six weeks and its site ranking consequently skyrocketed. It is clear that this site is providing a vital service to the public. I receive a steady stream of questions and requests to build out the site.<strong><em> Why only total cesarean rates? What about risk-adjusted rates? What about better VBAC data? Where is the District of Columbia?</em></strong> It goes on and on.</p>
<p><br/>In response to the flow of requests for more, I would like to say “yes”- but I cannot do it without your help.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Your help is necessary to continue this vital work. Please donate now!</strong></p>
<p><br/>The success of the sites led to an invitation to participate in a federal government-sponsored task force about lowering cesarean rates. I learned that there is a question on many stakeholders’ minds— <em>Does the public even care about cesarean rates rising?</em> Great question, but <strong>how can anyone gauge the public’s feelings or thoughts about cesarean rates if there are few places to find specific rates?</strong> Now, if the rates are publicly reported at all, they are buried beneath page after page on a department of health web site.</p>
<p><br/>I envision an online resource with accessible, standardized data that would be helpful to both the layperson and medical professional. You can help this vision become a reality by donating now—any amount will help.</p>
<p><br/><strong>If we can raise the funds together</strong>, Phase 2 of the site, which will continue until December 31, 2012, will include:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Building out <strong><a href=""http://www.cesareanrates.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CesareanRates.com</a></strong> to include regular posts on maternity care topics related to shared decision-making, practice variation, data reporting policy and law and media coverage of obstetrical utilization rates. In addition, I want to introduce a new framework for looking objectively at geographical extremes in obstetrical procedure utilizations rates and using long-standing research on informed choice, medical decision-making and practice variation that steers clear of the distracting and harmful “obstetric vs. natural” or “obstetrician vs. midwife” binary that wastes everyone’s time.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Updating all currently available data on cesarean utilization, which for many states involves pulling data from six separate pull-down menus with diagnostic related groups and calculating those. In a state with 150 or more hospitals providing maternity care, this is a very time-consuming endeavor, yet necessary if the point of the site is to show the most currently published data.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Adding additional reported data beyond what is currently found on CesareanRates.com, including VBAC rates, risk-adjusted rates, other obstetrical procedure rates, etc.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing ongoing work toward elevating patient and public right to data. Hospitals are big business, but the need to obscure administrative data of individual institutions to protect profits ultimately keeps patients in the dark.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>As for my story- I decided to go in to labor on my own, and learned first-hand why refusing a cesarean is so difficult, even for a so-called “educated” patient. I gave birth to a healthy baby in the hospital, and again to my second daughter in a birth center two years later. <em>I believe that all people deserve the opportunity to access the best information available needed to make medical decisions in conjunction with a supportive care provider and that we can all collectively benefit from pulling back the curtain on local practice patterns and procedure rates. </em></p>
<p><br/>We all agree that someone needs to do the work of reporting cesarean rates. History shows us that we can’t yet count on a reporting agency to do this because of hospitals’ fears of being exposed. <em><strong>Your donation of any amount says that you value placing the public’s right to data over a hospital’s right to protect their own financial interests. </strong></em></p>

<p>Cooper has already had one surgery on his spine and will require 4 or 5 more spine surgeries.  He also needs surgery on his eyes and he is scheduled for open heart surgery in May.  With each surgery Cooper's risk of paralysis or blindness becomes greater.  His doctors have suggested Cooper's mom should take Cooper to do the things he may never the get the chance to do after his surgeries.  Disneyland was recommended so Cooper could meet Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP</strong></p>
<p>We need donations to help fund Cooper's trip to Disneyland as well as to help his mom with all the uncovered medical expenses.  His mom will have expenses for transportation and meals during his hospital stay.  Cooper will be in the hospital for a minimum of three weeks and then require at home assistance for a minimum of a month, which is not covered by the insurance.</p>

<h2>The skinny:</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Austin Sims and I am a transgender individual. I <em><strong>was born female</strong> </em>and <strong><em>am living the rest of my life in as the person I was meant to be - an awesome guy with hopes of becoming a pediatrician, a wonderful husband, and an amazing father</em></strong>. I have been taking testosterone since 2010 and my life has been drastically changed for it.</p>
<p>Though my life has changed for the better, there is one more thing that I need to feel complete.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>-----Surgery.</h3>
<p>I need to have my ""top surgery"" which involves the removal of the breast tissue to create a more masculine chest.  In the state of Oklahoma, one must have a surgery to be able to legally be considered male. I am fairly large chested and have a difficult time hiding my natural chest so binding is my only option and is not, by medical standpoint, healthy longterm.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Binding Causes</strong>:</div>
<ul>
<li>fluid build up in the lungs</li>
<li>inhibited flow of the lymph system</li>
</ul><div>
<ul>
<li>back pain</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li> stiff and sore muscles</li>
</ul><div>
<ul>
<li> breathing problems and chest pain</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li> digestion issues</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Binding causes great anxiety for me at times and prevents me from being able to attend class or social events. It also interferes with my ability to concentrate on the task at hand, as I am always thinking about surgery and worried I will never be able to have it.
<p>I am asking for your help because I have tried for 3 years to save the funds to be able to feel normal and have been unsuccessful ( money always ends up going to emergency expenses like unplanned car repairs).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am currently working 8 hour days 7 days a week and going to school 4 hours a day Monday-Friday. My other option is a third job, with no down time to fully rest and allow my body to heal.</p>

<div> </div>
<p> </p>
<h3> IMPACT</h3>
<p>I cannot move forward with my life without this surgery. Because I am not legally considered male, I cannot marry and will have difficulty adopting children, and those two things are the things I want most in the world right now. I'm ready to move forward.</p>
<p>I saw the campaign for <strong>Donnie Collins</strong> ( <em><a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2285588/Donnie-Collins-surgery-Boston-fraternity-raises-18-000-brothers-sex-change-surgery.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2285588...</a></em> ) and was blown away by the support the indiegogo commmunity showed for his cause and can only hope and pray for the same level of support and blessing as well. It would truly change my life in the greatest way possible to be able to reach my goal.</p>
<p><strong>I need to raise $8000 total.</strong></p>
<p><strong>$6500 goes to medical expenses for the surgery, and the rest will go toward travel lodging expenses. </strong></p>
<p>If we ( I say we cause we are working toward this together) aren't able to achieve this goal in the allotted time, the funds raised will stay in an account to be used for surgery until I raise all the funds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If the goal is reached and I receive well over my goal amount, the funds will be donated to the Jim Collins foundation</strong> ( just like Donnie Collins' campaign found here <a href=""http://jimcollinsfoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://jimcollinsfoundation.org</a> ) to help others like myself live a life of normalcy as much as is possible. I appreciate any support you can give.</p>
If you are unable to donate, do not dismay! I still need help getting the word out. Methods I am using to spread the word about my campaign are:  <strong>window chalk ( writing the link on my rear windshield)  sidewalk chalk (to share the link on the sidewalk in high traffic areas)  flyers Sharing the link below the picture above on social networking sites like Facebook and twitter.</strong> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">If you are local, I would love the company when passing out flyers to businesses and residents!</span> </div>

<p> </p></div>","The skinny:
 
My name is Austin Sims and I am a transgender individual. I was born female and am living the rest of my life in as the person I was meant to be - an awesome guy with hopes of becoming a pediatrician, a wonderful husband, and an amazing father. I have been taking testosterone since 2010 and my life has been drastically changed for it.
Though my life has changed for the better, there is one more thing that I need to feel complete.
 
-----Surgery.
I need to have my ""top surgery"" which involves the removal of the breast tissue to create a more masculine chest.  In the state of Oklahoma, one must have a surgery to be able to legally be considered male. I am fairly large chested and have a difficult time hiding my natural chest so binding is my only option and is not, by medical standpoint, healthy longterm.

 

Binding Causes:

fluid build up in the lungs
inhibited flow of the lymph system


back pain



 stiff and sore muscles


 breathing problems and chest pain




 digestion issues


 
 
 
Binding causes great anxiety for me at times and prevents me from being able to attend class or social events. It also interferes with my ability to concentrate on the task at hand, as I am always thinking about surgery and worried I will never be able to have it.
I am asking for your help because I have tried for 3 years to save the funds to be able to feel normal and have been unsuccessful ( money always ends up going to emergency expenses like unplanned car repairs).
 
I am currently working 8 hour days 7 days a week and going to school 4 hours a day Monday-Friday. My other option is a third job, with no down time to fully rest and allow my body to heal.
 
PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO LISTEN TO MY INTERVIEW ON THE RICK AND BRAD MORNING RADIO SHOW ON 100.5 THE KATT FM TO SPEAK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES (4/10/2013). LISTEN HERE: http://www.katt.com/page.php?page_id=332
 
 
 IMPACT
I cannot move forward with my life without this surgery. Because I am not legally considered male, I cannot marry and will have difficulty adopting children, and those two things are the things I want most in the world right now. I'm ready to move forward.
I saw the campaign for Donnie Collins ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2285588... ) and was blown away by the support the indiegogo commmunity showed for his cause and can only hope and pray for the same level of support and blessing as well. It would truly change my life in the greatest way possible to be able to reach my goal.
I need to raise $8000 total.
$6500 goes to medical expenses for the surgery, and the rest will go toward travel lodging expenses. 
If we ( I say we cause we are working toward this together) aren't able to achieve this goal in the allotted time, the funds raised will stay in an account to be used for surgery until I raise all the funds.
 
If the goal is reached and I receive well over my goal amount, the funds will be donated to the Jim Collins foundation ( just like Donnie Collins' campaign found here http://jimcollinsfoundation.org ) to help others like myself live a life of normalcy as much as is possible. I appreciate any support you can give.
If you are unable to donate, do not dismay! I still need help getting the word out. Methods I am using to spread the word about my campaign are:  window chalk ( writing the link on my rear windshield)  sidewalk chalk (to share the link on the sidewalk in high traffic areas)  flyers Sharing the link below the picture above on social networking sites like Facebook and twitter. If you are local, I would love the company when passing out flyers to businesses and residents! 
 
 
 
 
 
What YOU Receive By Giving
 
By your generous donations, you can receive the following perks:
Handmade candles personally made by me, shipped or delivered to you at no cost.



Sketches of your favorite superhero or cartoon, done by me shipped at no cost.

 
Test Me Bro T-shirts with the molecular structure of Testosterone in RED, BLUE, or BLACK sizes SM-XXL.

 
You can also receive a friendship bracelet, a personal letter of appreciation, and the opportunity to have me serenade a person of your choosing via in person or phone! ( not pictured).

Like most responsible people, he worries about his children and grandchildren. Even a good parent can turn their head for just a moment and tragedy can strike. How many times have you watched the news and heard about a child who was snatched or who drowned in a pool? How about a child or pet who died after being accidently left in a car on a hot day, or a disoriented patient who wandered off and got lost? What about a child who was just in the next room who had an emergency and needed help? How many times have you lost your spouse or your child in a crowd at the amusement park or at the mall? How many times have you had to yell or whistle for your kids to come in from the yard for dinner? We have designed, developed and patented a product that can help you with all of these situations and more! Our product can truly save lives and help people. Think about the practical everyday applications and markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typical parents watching their children</li>
<li>Preventing a mentally challenged child or an Alzheimer’s patient from wandering off at night.</li>
<li>Locating a lost child in a crowd</li>
<li>Quick warning if your child falls into water.</li>
<li>Warning if your child is at an unsafe temperature (high or low)</li>
<li>Emergency call button so your child can notify you of danger or if he/she is scared</li>

</ul><p>Our company, <strong>Sekure Koncepts</strong>, and our product, <strong>Protecht</strong>, has a FOCUS on helping parents protect the ones they love, but you can see there are many other uses. The short video above tells you about the product and its many applications. But let me tell you about our PATENTS and what makes us unique.</p>
<ul>
<li>We do NOT utilize GPS so we work both indoors and outdoors and have NO MONTHLY FEEs</li>
<li>NOT line-of-sight technology so works in crowds and THROUGH walls</li>
<li>One parent unit can monitor and identify up to X tags at once</li>
<li>Two selectable invisible fence ranges for short(20'-30') and longer (70'-90"") distances.</li>
<li>On-board tracking with audio and visual queues</li>
<li>Microprocessors and advanced software in both the parent and child units</li>

<li>Unique (available only to Sekure Koncepts) radio design that allows us to switch frequencies hundreds of times per second. This allows for a very reliable connection between the units</li>
<li>No cross talk between units</li>
<li>Multi-function with one devise. (Invisible fences, tracking, water, temperature, lost signal, emergency call and call all)</li>
<li>LOW COST! Nothing does what we do. Line-of-sight units simply do not work and radio designs cost around $150 and are unreliable. The Protecht unit (one parent and one child) retails for about $79 and and only about $25 for each additional child tag</li>
</ul><p><strong>How will we use the money?</strong></p>
<p>Gene and his partners have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to make this life saving product available to parents everywhere. He and his colleagues have designed the product and written the software, they have built Alpha and Beta prototypes and tested the product. They have applied for patents (pending, but coming), paid attorneys, hired accounting firms, developed detailed marketing plans, hired a production company, designed tooling and test fixtures and handled hundreds of other details that come with launching a start-up company. Money is still needed for building the tooling and test fixtures, first production run of 500 units (to be tested by schools, nursing homes, daycare centers and families), liability insurance, packaging equipment, marketing and other expenses. In this current economy it is nearly impossible to get banks to let go of money, so YOUR HELP is really needed!</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges<br/></strong></p>
<p>We have proven the technology and we will never stop tweaking the software. We have met with dozens of retailers, schools, daycare centers, home healthcare companies, nursing homes and individual families and the interest level for this product is HIGH. The potential market is large and very diverse. We would like to produce 500 units this year for final field / market tests. The results of these final field tests will tell us whether the end users think our product is as awesome as we do. Assuming they do, our goal is to be in full production by the end of the first quarter of 2013. Our biggest hurdle at this point is the final funding still needed to launch the product. We hope that with the help of Indiegogo we can get this product to the market very soon. If we can save just one child’s life or help one parent find their lost child or let the spouse of an Alzheimer's patient get a good night's sleep without being concerned about their loved one wondering off, it will make our investment well worth it.</p></div>","Gene Skalicky is a husband, father of five, and a grandfather.

<p>The problem with diets, juice cleanses, and strict fasts are that they never address the underlying cause of why you can’t lose weight, keep it off, and take back your health &amp; vitality. They’re simply missing the key factors that allow you to effortlessly lose weight and reclaim the body you always wanted.</p>
<p>Think about this - if you have to force the weight off through hours of cardio and dieting, how do you plan to ever keep if off for good? You can’t and you won’t. The thing that’s been missing is that to enjoy the total package of health, energy, vitality, and your ideal body, you must rebalance the underlying root causes keeping you stuck where you are right now… <br/></p>

<p>Not only were fad diet and weight loss supplements not intended to help you keep the weight off, but they’ve set you up to fail thinking that it’s your fault you didn’t follow the plan correctly. Eventually they’ll lead you to believe that “nothing works for me.” </p>
<p>I’ve heard that thousands of times in my practice and I understand where you’re coming from. And I agree…  Diets (even whole food ones) do not hold the secret to why you don’t see the reflection you’d like to when you look in the mirror. They're missing something, and it’s something that no one seems to be looking at.<br/></p>

<p>For 10 years my wellness &amp; weight loss centers have completed over 150,000 client sessions – making our research data one of the largest weight loss &amp; wellness resources in the world. And 4 years ago, we took our revolutionary body transformation program to a whole new level.</p>
<p>After studying for years overseas in India, Sri Lanka, China, and the Netherlands I discovered how to combine state-of-the-art Functional Medicine with long-forgotten ancient healing traditions. The result was the most powerful, scientifically researched, full-body detoxification weight loss system ever created.</p>
<p>It finally addressed the underlying root causes keeping you from enjoying the life you always wanted at the weight you always dreamed of.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Why It Works</h2>
</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447267761/apbzg2cvlio3mxfefnfk.png"" src="""" style=""width: 467.305px; height: 294px;""/></p>
</div>
</div><p>At first I thought the initial client results were a fluke, but then the success stories kept coming. I knew it was formulated to work, but I honestly originally intended it for my private wellness clients that were suffering from immune imbalances and other debilitating health issues. The fringe benefit that came along with these clients getting well again, was always a substantial weight loss.</p>
<p>So, I kept digging deeper into why this formula was working so well to help clients lose weight and keep it off (besides the fact that they all reported elevated mood, clearer thinking, better skin, abundant energy, and improved digestion). It turned out that these 3 products combined held the key to rebalancing the systems of the body that control inflammation, water retention, bloating, fat burning, and metabolism. This is ultimately the key to addressing the underlying causes of why you look bloated and swollen and feel like “blah.” <br/></p><p><br/></p><div>

<p>Any fad diet can help you lose weight for a short period of time, but only a true wellness system can help you keep it off for good. The reason is that your body naturally sheds the weight as it returns to health and the Dr. Cabral Detox is intended to allow you to do that the simplest and easiest way possible through a strategic plan to address all your problem areas.</p><p>As I said before, weight loss is the symptom – not the cause. The cause of your weight issues may be hormonal, metabolic, adrenal, thyroid, immune, digestive, nutrient deficiencies, or toxicity. Hidden toxicities in one of the #1 reasons I see for people struggling to regain their health &amp; ideal body and that’s why the Dr. Cabral Detox works so quickly and effectively – it gets to the root cause of the problem by addressing the underlying issues! </p><h2>

</div></div>","Why You Don't Look & Feel Your Best 



The problem with diets, juice cleanses, and strict fasts are that they never address the underlying cause of why you can’t lose weight, keep it off, and take back your health & vitality. They’re simply missing the key factors that allow you to effortlessly lose weight and reclaim the body you always wanted.
Think about this - if you have to force the weight off through hours of cardio and dieting, how do you plan to ever keep if off for good? You can’t and you won’t. The thing that’s been missing is that to enjoy the total package of health, energy, vitality, and your ideal body, you must rebalance the underlying root causes keeping you stuck where you are right now… 

One Dimensional Diets Don't Work    


Not only were fad diet and weight loss supplements not intended to help you keep the weight off, but they’ve set you up to fail thinking that it’s your fault you didn’t follow the plan correctly. Eventually they’ll lead you to believe that “nothing works for me.” 
I’ve heard that thousands of times in my practice and I understand where you’re coming from. And I agree…  Diets (even whole food ones) do not hold the secret to why you don’t see the reflection you’d like to when you look in the mirror. They're missing something, and it’s something that no one seems to be looking at.

The Dr. Cabral Detox Was Born 





For 10 years my wellness & weight loss centers have completed over 150,000 client sessions – making our research data one of the largest weight loss & wellness resources in the world. And 4 years ago, we took our revolutionary body transformation program to a whole new level.
After studying for years overseas in India, Sri Lanka, China, and the Netherlands I discovered how to combine state-of-the-art Functional Medicine with long-forgotten ancient healing traditions. The result was the most powerful, scientifically researched, full-body detoxification weight loss system ever created.
It finally addressed the underlying root causes keeping you from enjoying the life you always wanted at the weight you always dreamed of.

Why It Works




At first I thought the initial client results were a fluke, but then the success stories kept coming. I knew it was formulated to work, but I honestly originally intended it for my private wellness clients that were suffering from immune imbalances and other debilitating health issues. The fringe benefit that came along with these clients getting well again, was always a substantial weight loss.
So, I kept digging deeper into why this formula was working so well to help clients lose weight and keep it off (besides the fact that they all reported elevated mood, clearer thinking, better skin, abundant energy, and improved digestion). It turned out that these 3 products combined held the key to rebalancing the systems of the body that control inflammation, water retention, bloating, fat burning, and metabolism. This is ultimately the key to addressing the underlying causes of why you look bloated and swollen and feel like “blah.” 


Targeted Weight Loss







Any fad diet can help you lose weight for a short period of time, but only a true wellness system can help you keep it off for good. The reason is that your body naturally sheds the weight as it returns to health and the Dr. Cabral Detox is intended to allow you to do that the simplest and easiest way possible through a strategic plan to address all your problem areas.As I said before, weight loss is the symptom – not the cause. The cause of your weight issues may be hormonal, metabolic, adrenal, thyroid, immune, digestive, nutrient deficiencies, or toxicity. Hidden toxicities in one of the #1 reasons I see for people struggling to regain their health & ideal body and that’s why the Dr. Cabral Detox works so quickly and effectively – it gets to the root cause of the problem by addressing the underlying issues! 
Naturopathic Doctor Designed




I spent years studying Naturopathic Medicine, Functional Medicine, Ayurveda Medicine, and many other practices all over the world. My goal was to not force anyone I care for to fit into one medical model, but rather choose the method that would best serve them.
This philosophy led me to design what I’ve seen in my own practice to be the very best way to begin the healing process and shed needless bloating, water retention, and the weight that is keeping you from loving the way you look and feel. 




What's In It?


Scientifically Researched Ingredients
Over the past 20 years I've read tens of thousands of pages of research and tested over 1,000 nutritional supplements in the real world. I've had the privilege to see what works and what doesn't...

This is what allowed me to formulate the cleanest and most powerful detoxification cleanse ever made. It is the answer to what I was searching for when it came to giving my wellness and weight loss clients the best results in the fastest time possible.

Non-GMOI never knew this until I began working with the top nutrition manufacturer in the US, but unless a nutritional supplement states it is non-GMO it most likely contains GMO ingredients. This is why it's imperative to look for the non-GMO seal and make sure any supplement you choose has done 3rd party testing. 

For everyone's piece of mind, I needed to make sure anything I recommend to my friends, family, and clients is something I truly believe will better their life. And I honestly believe the Dr. Cabral Detox is the best thing you can do for your mind and body. 7-Day Success Plan

My team consists for the main part of firefighters and has a rich history of ending high up in the ranks.We are always looking for new ways of increasing our benefits.

One of the ways we try to do this this year is raising money by selling an everyday self-developed product.Based on feasability, usefulness and match with the fire brigade, a choice was made for a little plastic firefighters helmet to hang from your keychain that can contain a token or a 50-eurocent coin.


What We Need & What You Get
When developing a (plastic) product, three phases are important and therefore expensive. Commitment is already made for the raw material and the injection molding itself. The costs of the mold however are the main reason we have started this campain. A safe estimate made clear we need 5500 US dollars for having this mold produced.And when the injection molding eventually starts, an allmost innumerable amount of products can be made. Each of our team members is going to sell copies to his or hers family and friends. Batches of a 1000 copies can and will be sold for a reduced price to competative (firebrigade) teams. Firebrigade related companies are already approached for bying this product as the most appealling gift to their relations.




Other Ways You Can Help


When setting up this campaign, we have chosen to tick the box 'not to refund anyones contribution', because we believe that receiving a product is not so much anyones goal; deeper it is about supporting our good cause.
When you are a mold maker or injection molder and you are triggered, challenged and determined to beat the 5500 dollar goal yourself, feel absolutely free to contact us. This would mean an enormous boost. (For your info, the product can be formed in in a simple open/close mold and has a projected surface of approximately 2,33 square inch).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>** CHALLENGE TO DOUBLE OUR GOAL!!  EVERY DONATION WILL HELP!</strong></h2>
<h2>Please help raise money for Gift!</h2>
</div>
<p>Many people who read this will recognize Gift from her receptionist work at the front desk of the Florida School of Massage, where she has been most visible for the last 13 years.  But many, many others will remember her from being touched in the more unseen places in our everyday lives.  Gift has made it her quiet yet steadfast mission to reach out to populations and organizations that would not otherwise be able to receive massage.  The young parents at Arbor House, the domestically abused at Peaceful Paths, the poor and hungry at St. Francis House, the parents and children and staff at Ronald McDonald House, to name just a few – there are so many grateful strangers and now friends whom Gift has touched through the outreach programs she established at FSM.  Most recently Gift has also been dedicating her time and loving presence to the Student Clinic at the school, adding elements of organization, humor, and sensitivity to an often bustling and unique therapeutic environment.  Last but not least, some may know Gift because you are or were a massage client of hers.  At 5’1” and barely 115 pounds, many of us who have received her massage know that she could give as much as we could take.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the point of this fundraising campaign.  Gift has tirelessly dedicated her life to serving others by giving, extending herself, giving again, and then offering more.  Her co-workers witnessed this every day, the students at FSM commented on it in their final program evaluations, and community organizations dedicated awards to the school because of the work she spearheaded for us with them.</p>
<h2><strong>Here is the reason for this crucial call for financial assistance for our friend Gift: </strong></h2>
<p>Back in late July, Gift began to feel some pain in her left leg.  She attributed it to a home-base slide she had done earlier in the summer while playing kickball with her grandchildren.  She limped at first, then began to hobble around, then began to use crutches because she could not put weight on the leg.  In true Gift fashion, she tried every alternative approach to ease the pain: massage from her friends, network chiropractic treatments, and acupuncture.  The pain merely got worse, causing her to finally seek out an allopathic opinion from the kind doctors at Shands Hospital.  An x-ray showed some bone degeneration in the area that caused the physicians to take some further tests. They recommended surgery and Gift reluctantly agreed to the procedure on Thursday, September 6.  Once inside, the surgeon confirmed his suspicion: there were cancerous cells eating at Gift’s left tibia.  He chose to implement a rod into her leg to further prevent any fracture of the weakened bone.</p>
<p>Doctors determined that the cancer in the leg was not a primary site and they aggressively began to search Gift’s body over the next 24-48 hours for the primary site.  Several tests later, they concluded the main tumor was on Gift’s cervix.  For the next day or two, specialists from gynecology, oncology and radiology poked, prodded and talked with Gift about her options – which now included radiation, chemotherapy, and bone-enhancing injections.  Gift, who has always placed life-supporting and natural remedies over conventional life-draining and drug-based options, decided she would attempt to heal herself through alternative methods.  Reminding her to take a day at a time, with nothing set in stone, the medical team blessed her on her way.</p>
<p>Two weeks into what Gift believed was simply a very s-l-o-w recovery, she revisited her surgeon for a check on her leg sutures and progress.  When Gift said she still found it hard to put weight on the leg, the surgeon took another picture.  Much to Gift’s dismay, the bone had degenerated further.  The medical team appeared again and <em>strongly encouraged</em> Gift to start a 10-day course of radiation on the leg only.  She started the next day, and is now in the middle of that process.</p>
<p>Gift does not have health insurance. She has not been able to work since September 5. She has rent to pay, utilities, and now exorbitant medical bills.  We are asking for a simple donation of $5, $10, whatever you can give will help!  Think of a time when Gift extended her hand or heart to you – now is the opportunity to give back to her.  Also note if you give $40 or more you can choose a gift for yourself in return.  Massages are available from the student clinic or the professional clinic, depending on your level of giving.</p>
<p>Gift intends to beat this dis-ease and be around to serve us all for another 54 years!  She has a daughter, three sons, and three grandkids.  So even if you can’t give just a $1 or $2 at this time, a prayer (however known) for her healing and recovery would also go a long way towards her ongoing intention for more peace and love amongst us in the world.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help! </p>

<p class=""FreeForm"">Alec Jacob Torchon, our wonderful son and Jackson's 19-year old brother, is incredibly well loved by family ,friends and all who knew him.  He loved his brother, loved his parents and loved his family - and he knew and felt how much we all loved him. </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">He finally got to the point where he was excited about his life, his future and there was no doubt that he was the happiest he may have ever been.    </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">We are compelled to say that he died accidentally from a foolish mixture of alcohol and a drug that we suspect at this time was a painkiller.  As the Santa Barbara Sheriff told us, he does not understand why college students continually ignore what they know about mixing drugs and alcohol - it kills. This is something that happens to other people, other parents and other families. Yet, this happened to our son AJ, who was on his way to making this world a better place.</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">We understand no words can express the heartfelt pain we all share.  Jeannette, Ric and Jackson wish to thank you for all your thoughts and prayers.</p>
<p><strong>Please help make AJ's death less wasteful than it already is by warning your teenage friends and family that if they ever see someone at a party drinking and about to put another drug into their body, to stop them and tell that person, ""I know of a wonderful young man named AJ that did what you are about to do and he never woke up, never lived the rest of his life, and his family and friends will always miss him.""</strong></p>

<p>The Alec Torchon Foundation has been created in loving memory of our beloved son whose life was taken from the World far too soon.  The mission of the Alec Torchon Foundation is to educate college students and their families on the deadly consequences of alcohol and drug use as well as to ensure that college students have access to the proper level of counseling, support and guidance.   </p>
<p>We love and miss you AJ.  You are loved by so many, and we each will carry you in our hearts forever.</p>

<p align=""center"" class=""FreeForm"">A Little About Our Beloved AJ</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">AJ was someone who excelled at everything he put his mind into doing. He was an excellent student and graduated from Novato High School in 2011 with a GPA above 4.0. He was  part of the Marin School of the Arts program, where he played drums. He was an excellent musician, in part, due to his overall love of music. From there he went on to attend the University of California at Santa Barbara where he was majoring in BioPsychology. AJ had a passion for many things during his all too brief life; a love for his family, his friends, his music and so much more. He may leave us in body but his spirit will live on within us forever.</p>
<p align=""center"" class=""FreeForm"">A Few Of AJ’s Favorite Quotations </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">“You don’t want to be overlooked, but you don’t want to be looked over too much.” -- Aesop Rock</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">“When you’ve never been moved its really hard to move on.” -- Michael Larson (Eyedea)</p>

<div> </div></div>","Alec Jacob Torchon, our wonderful son and Jackson's 19-year old brother, is incredibly well loved by family ,friends and all who knew him.  He loved his brother, loved his parents and loved his family - and he knew and felt how much we all loved him. 
He finally got to the point where he was excited about his life, his future and there was no doubt that he was the happiest he may have ever been.    
We are compelled to say that he died accidentally from a foolish mixture of alcohol and a drug that we suspect at this time was a painkiller.  As the Santa Barbara Sheriff told us, he does not understand why college students continually ignore what they know about mixing drugs and alcohol - it kills. This is something that happens to other people, other parents and other families. Yet, this happened to our son AJ, who was on his way to making this world a better place.
We understand no words can express the heartfelt pain we all share.  Jeannette, Ric and Jackson wish to thank you for all your thoughts and prayers.
Please help make AJ's death less wasteful than it already is by warning your teenage friends and family that if they ever see someone at a party drinking and about to put another drug into their body, to stop them and tell that person, ""I know of a wonderful young man named AJ that did what you are about to do and he never woke up, never lived the rest of his life, and his family and friends will always miss him.""
 “To live in the hearts we leave behind is not to die.”
-Thomas Campbell
 
In lieu of flowers, we kindly request a donation be made to the Alec Torchon Foundation:


The Alec Torchon Foundation has been created in loving memory of our beloved son whose life was taken from the World far too soon.  The mission of the Alec Torchon Foundation is to educate college students and their families on the deadly consequences of alcohol and drug use as well as to ensure that college students have access to the proper level of counseling, support and guidance.   
We love and miss you AJ.  You are loved by so many, and we each will carry you in our hearts forever.


A Little About Our Beloved AJ
AJ was someone who excelled at everything he put his mind into doing. He was an excellent student and graduated from Novato High School in 2011 with a GPA above 4.0. He was  part of the Marin School of the Arts program, where he played drums. He was an excellent musician, in part, due to his overall love of music. From there he went on to attend the University of California at Santa Barbara where he was majoring in BioPsychology. AJ had a passion for many things during his all too brief life; a love for his family, his friends, his music and so much more. He may leave us in body but his spirit will live on within us forever.
A Few Of AJ’s Favorite Quotations

“When you’ve never been moved its really hard to move on.” -- Michael Larson (Eyedea)

“Its beautiful the way agony connects us to the living. I think of the world when I hurt, and keep on existing in the now.” - Eyedea

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Brixton Mary is a beautiful, precious, sweet 1 year old baby girl who is FIGHTING a rare childhood cancer called Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB). Her cancerous tumor was discovered when she was just 6 weeks old and removed when she was 6 months old. Although doctors feel confident they removed the entire tumor, PPB is a very aggressive type of cancer that has a high rate of re-occurence in young children under the age of 5. There are currently only approximately 380 cases WORLDWIDE reported since the early 1980's when it was first discovered. Research indicates chemotherapy is the best route to take to ensure survival for children with this diagnosis; to reduce risk of re-occurence. Brixton will be receiving chemotherapy over the next 9 months. For those of you who are not aware, chemotherapy on a small child is frightening, exhausting, saddening, and extremely hard on a child as well as the parents and family. LET'S UNITE AND FIGHT THIS AWFUL DISEASE! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Although the Collins family has insurance, they will need at LEAST $5,000 just to help cover co-pays for inpatient hospital stays. In addition to medical expenses, there are other major costs associated with caring for a child with cancer.  Although we know that the costs will far exceed $5,000, we didn't want to set an overwhelming goal and our hope is to actually surpass our goal significantly!</p>
<p>The financial assistance they need will also include: outpatient visits, medication costs, travel, gas, enhanced nutrition, lost pay for mom and dad due to missed work days, etc. The family lives roughly 75 miles away from Rady Children's hospital where they need to travel at minimum, once per week for the next 9 months. The gas costs alone are astronomical for this family. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will enhance the quality of life for this precious girl and her family. The stress of the disease itself is enough to make a child more sick let alone the financial stress. Let's work together and help relieve financial burden so that Brixton's mom and dad can focus all of their energy on this sweet girl and her brothers! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Monetary contributions are tremedously appreciated. However, if you are not able to donate, we ask you to share this page with everyone you know. Post the link on facebook.

<p>Let
me introduce you to Pristine Farms, and
Grandma.  On the farm, we reared tropical
fish exclusively--until recently.  Grandma
changed that.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Around
the age of 75 she was diagnosed with cancer.  We tried to get her to have the needed surgery but she refused.  “I’m too old to go through all that mess.”  After many attempts, I found out her real reason for not wanting the
surgery.  She had heard of the horrors
of chemo-therapy and was fearful of having to go through it<i>. <b>(You may know
someone that had chemo and understand the problems they may have had.)</b></i>  She lived many years more without
complications before passing. </p>
<p>Chemotherapy
patients while suffering with cancer, face additional challenges.  Chemotherapy often not only causes the
patient physical problems, but also alters the taste of foods, imparting a
metallic taste to the foods once enjoyed and needed in the patient’s fight
against the cancer.  This in turn causes
the patient to avoid these foods and additionally, often causes a drastic loss
in weight.</p>
<p>For many, Miracle
Fruit,  a small red berry, has the ability to eliminate the bad
taste of foods caused by chemotherapy.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Weight
loss caused by the patients avoiding the “metallic tasting foods” could be
drastically reduced or eliminated by Miracle fruit.  With an enjoyable, nutritious diet weight-loss could be minimized giving patients stronger, healthier bodies to fight
the cancer. </span></p>

me introduce you to Pristine Farms, and
Grandma.  On the farm, we reared tropical
fish exclusively--until recently.  Grandma
changed that.

Around
the age of 75 she was diagnosed with cancer.  We tried to get her to have the needed surgery but she refused.  “I’m too old to go through all that mess.”  After many attempts, I found out her real reason for not wanting the
surgery.  She had heard of the horrors
of chemo-therapy and was fearful of having to go through it. (You may know
someone that had chemo and understand the problems they may have had.)  She lived many years more without
complications before passing. 
Chemotherapy
patients while suffering with cancer, face additional challenges.  Chemotherapy often not only causes the
patient physical problems, but also alters the taste of foods, imparting a
metallic taste to the foods once enjoyed and needed in the patient’s fight
against the cancer.  This in turn causes
the patient to avoid these foods and additionally, often causes a drastic loss
in weight.
For many, Miracle
Fruit,  a small red berry, has the ability to eliminate the bad
taste of foods caused by chemotherapy.  Weight
loss caused by the patients avoiding the “metallic tasting foods” could be
drastically reduced or eliminated by Miracle fruit.  With an enjoyable, nutritious diet weight-loss could be minimized giving patients stronger, healthier bodies to fight
the cancer. 
See the following research articles regarding chemotherapy and miracle fruit.

<p>On June 16,2013 I was in a near fatal car crash with my brother. I broke every vertebra in my spine while my brother broke 3 ribs and his collar bone. My Mother and Stepfather moved out of the house the week of the accident taking their belongings and moving to Texas. They emptied our bank accounts and took the money we had collected to pay the rent and bills. I had surgery on September 3, 2013 at Highland Alameda County Medical Center to have titanium rods, pins and plates to repair my spine. It will be a year before I will know if I can work again. All of the agencies I have spoken with have  told me that they do not have the funding, space or resources to assist our family, specifically because of my disability and, my lack of income.</p>
<p>The impact of this donation campaign will assist us in finding a place to live while I recover from my surgery and take care of basic needs like paying rent, fixing the donated car (that needs to be repaired) so my brother can go back to work full time and assist me in taking my children to and from school, taking to my physical therapy and numerous follow-up medical appointments at Highland Medical Center in Oakland. My Brother Jason has been my primary caregiver and support system before and since the accident.  </p>
<p>I have applied for Social Services (welfare for myself and my children). I have also applied for Social Security and Social Security Disability but these processes take time.</p>
<p>My Brother and I just went through the eviction hearing process on August 11, 2013 and as long as we vacate the house before December 10,2013 (about 60 days)  we will not be charged for back rent, have a court eviction on our records and will have a positive rental reference from our Landlords. </p>

The most versatile, multipurpose, collapsible shaker bottle! We all know hydration is extremely important in our lives to maintain fitness and overall well-being. Now I know what you're thinking, there are hundreds of thousands of types of other bottles out there, why the GoPUCC?I'll get to that in a second...Everyone drinks different beverages besides water (i.e. coffee, pre-workout, post-workout protein shakes, meal replacement shakes, adult beverages, the list goes on..). Of these, each bottle is usually specialized to accept ONE particular drink. A water bottle is a water bottle, a shaker bottle is a shaker bottle, and a coffee cup is a coffee cup. Many of them are all great, but also consist of many parts and are difficult to clean and maintain in our busy lifestyle. Some of them are noisy, some you can't get out that nasty protein smell, and some just are not aesthetically pleasing.It is time to bring it back to the basics, but innovate. This is where the GoPUCC was born. For the ""on-the-go"" person, you likely are traveling somewhere all the time. By foot, by bike, by car, by plane. You probably carry a phone and wallet with you all the time and often leave your hydration bottle somewhere. On the contrary, you might also have a cabinet full of all of these types of specialized bottles to accommodate for the beverages listed above. This is where the GoPUCC bridges the gap.A durable, military-grade bottle you can carry with you everywhere.   Like many of you, we knew there was a better way. You no longer need to carry multiple bottles with you. With GoPUCC, you just need one. You can take this bottle camping, eat soups/oatmeal/cereal out of it. You name it!   Going to a party? Cheers to some beer with it! Even make the perfect mixed drinks with your GoPUCC! The days of putting your name with a marker on a disposable cup are gone!    The GoPUCC is a new innovative hydration bottle that accommodates any beverage you want to take with you, using the same bottle. If you want to go to work with a coffee, and later fill it up with water, to use it after the gym and put your protein in there, you can do it all with one bottle! In between these, the GoPUCC collapses into a ""puck"" like shape (I bet you didn't guess that one!) to eliminate wasted space in the event you need to travel. Who has room in their luggage for an empty water bottle? Space is important, and we know from firsthand experience.The GoPUCC was founded by two military veterans and developed by athletes just like you who want the ""jack of all trades"" type of bottle that is conducive to your active lifestyle.In this case, less is more. We did all the hard work for you so you can live with your GoPUCC and know that you can enjoy your coffee, pre-workout, post workout, water and even adult beverage from just one bottle, anywhere you go!Join us as a Founding Backer and claim your new Personal Utility Collapsible Canteen! About Us Brandon (blue shirt) is a 13 year active duty Air Force veteran, CrossFit Level 2 Trainer, Husband, and Father of two.

The iHeart System empowers people with knowledge about their physical state they wouldn't otherwise know. 








Why care about Aortic Stiffness?Aortic stiffness has been linked to an individual’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease and their overall health. By using the iHeart device, people can view information they need and motivation to make positive lifestyle choices. 


iHeart is a fully developed and tested fingertip pulse analysis system linked to iPhones and iPads. It is ready for commercial production. We need your help to manufacture iHeart in quantity and support R & D, leading to other personal health monitoring products in the pipeline.

The iHeart device measures your pulse for 30 seconds and provides immediate results on your iPhone or iPad loaded with the free iHeart Physiological Age application. With positive lifestyle choices you can actually watch yourself get physiologically younger day by day.  
The iHeart Oximeter has the highest sampling rate of any pulse oximeter on the market. The iHeart System can see so deep into the pulse that distinct waves are found that allow us to determine aortic stiffness. 





















The iHeart device has market leading resolution and sampling speed, there are no other oximeters like it. The iHeart can see deep into your pulse to define waves in the blood flow. This provides accurate measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity and paired with our app and measurement methods (patent pending) determine your physiological age. 




 








The fingertip sensor connects via Bluetooth 4.0 to your iPad or iPhone loaded with our free Physiological Age app. The test takes 30 seconds and results are immediate. Results are stored on your own personal iheartalive.com website.

Trending Screen




Past results and trending graphs are stored both on the user's iPhone and/or iPad as well as their www.iheartalive.com personal webpage. 
This device will allow the user to understand the dynamic nature
of their body and see how different choices are effecting their body internally. 
We have a fully functional and successfully beta tested product and iOs application which will be sent out February, 2015 to early adopters. 
The iHeart
Physiological Age Monitor system has been validated against aortic pulse wave
velocity testing using the gold standard method of aortic stiffness testing.

A recent study shows that there's a strong relationship between aerobic exercise and arterial stiffness. The more vigorous the exercise, the better the effect. Check it out here.


This campaign is so important to us as a small Canadian startup to help provide funding to sell our first 500 devices! 








As a small tech startup we need funding to manufacture and make our orders! We will be sending our product to early adopters February, 2015.

“15 years ago Moy Lin Shin, a Taoist Monk and my Tai Chi teacher, asked me to show people health benefits associated with stretching between the heart and the kidneys. Surprisingly, the medical scientific literature confirmed that the stiffer your Aorta (and your body’s core) the greater your chance of developing illness. iHeart allows people to easily visualize and follow improvements in core mobility with exercise, good diet and stress reduction. iHeart, promised to a Taoist monk, delivered to you.”




SARAH GOODMANDirector of Marketing & Public Relations


Sarah’s experience in marketing and public relations as well as her designations as both a registered holistic nutritionist (RHN) and certified personal trainer (CPT) provide her with the knowledge and skills to be an effective communications professional for the Vitalsines team.
“I have a personal experience with iHeart. I’ve had three knee surgeries in my life, two of which were in a three week period last year. Using iHeart, I was able to monitor my recovery in a very different way than I had after previous injuries. Watching my iHeart readings improve, and my physiological age drop, provided insight I had never had before. It gave me such great motivation and bodily awareness. I still use iHeart daily to see how my body changes and reacts to both positive and negative stimulus.”



BENOIT LEWDEN MSc, EngineeringDirector of Application Development
Ben is an engineer with experience in biosignal analysis,
server based secure data management, oximeter arterial pulse signal acquisition and analysis. He is also an expert in Android and iPhone App development, web site programming, real
time data communication/notification and PhD level research study design. 


“The iHeart project
is a perfect example of the reasons I love what I do. I get to utilize top
notch technology and analyze data in very novel ways to create a product that
will be used by people. I'm especially enthusiastic about this project because
it had a direct effect on my life. I started to work on it a few months after I
quit smoking and got to witness the real-time changes in my own arterial pulse wave as
the months went by. It was a great motivation and I'd like to share this experience with others.”

As a company, we are dedicated to helping people understand what’s happening in their bodies and how they can optimize health naturally. Our goal is to help motivate people to change for the better, and by doing so improve their health and life in general.

So come on, get younger with iHeart. 






Your contribution will allow for a larger group of people
to gain awareness of the iHeart system, which has the opportunity to change
lives through positive motivation. 
iHeart Physiological Age Monitor is one of a roll out of
devices that will be launched by VitalSines, Inc under the iHeart Name.






Aortic Stiffness is a powerful proven indicator of internal health. Over 100 articles in the medical scientific literature have shown aortic stiffness as a valid indicator of heart health and overall health. 


iHeart is designed to be used by health oriented individuals aged 18-70.


NO iheart is not a medical device. It is a health and wellness educational tool. iHeart should not be used as a diagnostic tool. It is not intended to be used for any medical diagnosis or management of any medical condition.  


We will being shipping in February, 2015.
