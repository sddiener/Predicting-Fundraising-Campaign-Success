<p>We’re gonna need cash for this operation, and we’re hoping you might cut us a deal: investing your hard-earned dollars, pounds, euros, pesos, shillings, yen, or other legal tender in our project in exchange for a guaranteed return. That is, the gratification of knowing that you are a true supporter of the art of theatre, not to mention earning yourself a nice little prize from the list of returns on our left (your right) as a token of our gratitude.</p>
<p>To get this show right, and make it the best we can, we're going to need your help. We've got some elements covered, such as graciously donated rehearsal space. </p><p>Here's a breakdown of where your capital is going. </p>
<h4>Equipment: £900</h4><p>A projector. That's the main problem. They're expensive; and we need one to bring Betsy Dadd's extraordinary work alive in the theatre. We'll be hiring one, but we need a good one to do the job. We'll also need a lot of sundries to take you with us on a madcap journey. </p><h4>Lights/Sound: £350</h4><p>More gear.

We are Les Foules: The Crowds. We make theatre that asks questions. Intelligent, surprising, atmospheric stories that our audiences have described as beautifully brutal, fast-paced and brave creations that dare to say something important.
We’ve assembled an all-star team for this one, including:Performance:                                        Sound:Norma Butikofer                                         Tom MacLeanNadege Adlam  Lennard Sillevis                                      Lighting:Brian Tynan                                                   Sarah CrockerDesign:                                                   Production:Betsy Dadd                                                   Cass FumiDramaturgy:                                         Direction:Peter Wiedmann                                         Nathalie Adlam

17-21 February 2016, 18:00, The Forge, VAULT Festival
Alaska, 66° north, or just shy of it. 
Childhood buddies Brett and Kathy confront a fissured friendship at the fossil-fuel frontier of the Arctic. Up here the day doesn’t start over every day.
From crass commie yarns to company spin, god-giving missions to perished prospectors, whale oil to petroleum, Brett heads northwards, where myths, money, and  politics crackle and spit in a fuel doused arctic dream. 
We’re drilling to the bottom of our outlandish orders of exploration and laws of extraction in a kicked-up Western gone North. An intimate portrayal of friendship and camaraderie opens out onto a narrative expanse of arctically proportioned disorientation and division. 

The Ask  
We’re gonna need cash for this operation, and we’re hoping you might cut us a deal: investing your hard-earned dollars, pounds, euros, pesos, shillings, yen, or other legal tender in our project in exchange for a guaranteed return. That is, the gratification of knowing that you are a true supporter of the art of theatre, not to mention earning yourself a nice little prize from the list of returns on our left (your right) as a token of our gratitude.
To get this show right, and make it the best we can, we're going to need your help. We've got some elements covered, such as graciously donated rehearsal space. Here's a breakdown of where your capital is going. 
Equipment: £900A projector. That's the main problem. They're expensive; and we need one to bring Betsy Dadd's extraordinary work alive in the theatre. We'll be hiring one, but we need a good one to do the job. We'll also need a lot of sundries to take you with us on a madcap journey. Lights/Sound: £350More gear. And the people to run it. Distinctive lighting design and sound are elements that have made Les Foules' shows so atmospheric and enjoyable. Without them, well, you won't see us. Costume: £100With lights, you'll see us. But without costume, what you'll see won't be pretty. Publicity: £150We don't want you to have to sit there all by yourself in the audience when you come to see us.

not coincidental: Dortmund is well known for its internationally interconnected

in Dortmund,
inflatable barricades willbe erected in different locations in the city.
Thwarting the neo-Nazi rally wherever it surfaces, the reflective barricades
will travel through the city and merge together – coalescing into a
colossal union of people power. They will come together to literally hold up a
mirror to xenophobia and racism. </p>
<p>These barricades were
tested for the first time at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, 2015 when they
were used to block road intersections to enable a 10,000 person demonstration
to take the streets. </p>
<p>Theoretically, thousands
can participate in this social sculpture. This will give the much-needed
spotlight and media presence to the engaged citizens of Dortmund rebuking the oppression the neo-Nazi
espouse.</p>
<p>Partly a substantial Nazi blockade,

will be cube building workshops at the Schauspiel Dortmund Theatre. Additionally,
there are trainings at the Katharinentreppen in Dortmund each Sunday. These trainings are essential

<h3>Macbeth</h3>
<p>These are historic times. </p>
<p>We witness daily accounts of fake news, alternate facts, and self-interest. We experienced the largest political demonstration in American history, with millions of participants all over the world marching for equality on January 21st. We face the dissolution of the NEA, the threat of further regressions in social equality, and extraordinary greed modeled by elected politicians in our government. </p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we need to look back to move forward. We need MACBETH. And we need to experience it. <br/> </p>
<h3>Our Macbeth</h3>
<p>On March 10th and 11th, we - an ensemble of Juilliard students - are literally putting audience members in the middle of the action, placing spectators in rolling office chairs in the center of a Bushwick warehouse space, surrounded by the action. Using simple contemporary costumes and practical lights, we are framing this classic in a familiar, decaying environment. </p>
<p>Our minimalist, direct, and actor-driven telling of <i>Macbeth</i> thrusts audiences right into the middle of this frenzied cautionary classic about greed, abuse of power, and witchcraft. The idea is to explore the very real, and very human magic involved in the play, both confronting and implicating the audience in questions of ambition, ritual, and fate.  After a successful workshop in January 2017, we are thrilled to share this production of <i>Macbeth</i> with audiences this spring. <br/> </p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>As a student-initiated project, we are mounting this production with a modest budget. This project is made possible in part through a Project Grant with the Marks Center for Entrepreneurship at Juilliard. We need your help getting the rest of the way there!</p>
<p><u><strong>Our Budget:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>$1200 - Amazing Brooklyn warehouse space for three days of tech and performances</li>
<li>$190 - Renter’s Insurance</li>
<li>$30 - Clip lights</li>
<li>$40 - Props and Costumes</li>
<li>$40 - Audience seating (roller office chairs and benches)</li>
<li>$100 - U-Haul </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TOTAL UNMET NEED: $700</strong></p>
<p>Your support helps us bring this cautionary epic to new light. Contributions of all shapes and sizes are welcome! </p>
<p>As a play produced in the spirit of exposing the threats demagogues pose to humanity, <u>all funds raised beyond our essential expenses will be donated to the ACLU</u>. Please help us help them fight the good fight - and give, give, give!</p>
<p>Thank you for your support. See you in March!</p>

Using simple contemporary costumes and practical lights, we are framing this classic in a familiar, decaying environment. 
Our minimalist, direct, and actor-driven telling of Macbeth thrusts audiences right into the middle of this frenzied cautionary classic about greed, abuse of power, and witchcraft. The idea is to explore the very real, and very human magic involved in the play, both confronting and implicating the audience in questions of ambition, ritual, and fate.  After a successful workshop in January 2017, we are thrilled to share this production of Macbeth with audiences this spring.  
How You Can Help
As a student-initiated project, we are mounting this production with a modest budget. This project is made possible in part through a Project Grant with the Marks Center for Entrepreneurship at Juilliard. We need your help getting the rest of the way there!
Our Budget:

$1200 - Amazing Brooklyn warehouse space for three days of tech and performances
$190 - Renter’s Insurance
$30 - Clip lights
$40 - Props and Costumes
$40 - Audience seating (roller office chairs and benches)
$100 - U-Haul 

TOTAL UNMET NEED: $700
Your support helps us bring this cautionary epic to new light. Contributions of all shapes and sizes are welcome! 
As a play produced in the spirit of exposing the threats demagogues pose to humanity, all funds raised beyond our essential expenses will be donated to the ACLU. Please help us help them fight the good fight - and give, give, give!
Thank you for your support. See you in March!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The founders of Birdsnest Theatre are Beth and Emily. We met whilst working at the lovely Polka Theatre for children in London. Between us we have experience in theatre, schools and the music industry. Now with young families of our own, we are inspired to make our own theatre. We are based in the UK and will also tour other European countries in the coming year.</p>
<p>Birdsnest theatre are passionate about creating exciting theatre for children under 5 and their adults. Our theatre is very design led and always contains live music.</p>
<p>Birdsnest like happy faces; Something out of nothing; magical moments; beautiful things; Simplicity; Surprising people; playing; playing with words; sounds; rhythms; Touching things; Sharing; Intriguing spaces; Journeys; A good story.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-decoration: none;"">Birdsnest would like lots of people to join in. As many as possible. They know what a gem it is to be gifted a shared experience with your child. Children are constantly blasted with virtual experiences and high technology. We believe in exploring the world through the magic of theatre.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-decoration: none;"">Birdsnest know that the best way to create great theatre is  to learn from children and so we always involve children's groups in our devising processes through workshops and residencies.

<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-decoration: none;"">We urgently need money to register Birdsnest theatre for charitable status.

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $1000 to cover the costs of registering Birdsnest Theatre and to apply for charitable status.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the entire goal, the funds raised will still go towards this and we will fund the rest ourselves.</p>
<p>Our perks include opportunities to be involved with our unique rehearsal processes, thanks in our programme and free tickets.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Birdnest believe that all children deserve to have access to high quality, creative experiences; allowing them to explore and learn about their world in an imaginative way; and to develelop various skills, including language. In a busy world, theatre allows time to reflect; slow down; experience together.</p>
<p>The current economical climate means that funding for arts projects is constantly being cut. We are very passionate that children should continue to have opportunities to engage with the arts. These opprtunities are as important  to a child's health and well-being as is access to sports, for example.</p>
<p>Our fledging project ''Blown Away'' drew praise from one of the UK's top theatre companies for young children <strong>Oily Cart</strong>. They are now mentoring us. We also have support from 2 other brilliant and leading companies <strong>Polka Theatre for Children</strong> and <strong>Royal and Derngate, Northampton. </strong>We are touring a show this Autumn and we have also recently won a European seeding fund to create a new show to tour in the Uk and Europe in 2013.</p>
<p>We have the skills and contacts to make fabulous theatre for a new generation of theatre audiences. Help us  and contribute whatever you can to our campaign. Any amount, big or small will be gratefully received.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate that not everyone is able to contribute but you can also help us out by spreading the word. Please pass this on to everyone you know.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

We also have support from 2 other brilliant and leading companies Polka Theatre for Children and Royal and Derngate, Northampton. We are touring a show this Autumn and we have also recently won a European seeding fund to create a new show to tour in the Uk and Europe in 2013.
We have the skills and contacts to make fabulous theatre for a new generation of theatre audiences. Help us  and contribute whatever you can to our campaign. Any amount, big or small will be gratefully received.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Humble Play: New Play festival of Appalachian Ohio began in 2006 as a way to promote the craft of playwriting and introduce play development to an audience.</p>
<p>We are starting our campaign to raise funds to help with the expenses of offering our festival this year.</p>
<p>To have the funds from this campaign would enable us to present an even better play festival.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $2,000 - this money (regardless of our reaching or goal or not) will be used to help pay for travel, lodging and food for the theater professional who will join us this year.  It will also be used to pay for the rental of the facility in which the festival takes place and for advertising.</p>
<p>We have lots of unique perks for those who donate to our campaign such as free advertising in our program, signed scripts, photos of casts and directors, special reception, appreciation dinner, and more...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Playwriting is different from other types of writing because theater is a collaborative art form. The play doesn’t exist until actors give the characters life and the production team brings the world of the play to an audience. Because of this collaboration, playwrights can’t develop their writing alone; they need collaborators. Only when playwrights are able to hear their words out loud and in front of an audience are they able to determine what works and what doesn’t. This process, called play development, is a labor-intensive and expensive endeavor, but absolutely necessary to creating new plays. That’s why it’s so important that new play festivals exist: to give playwrights the opportunity to develop their plays. This is the reason the Humble Play: New Play Festival of Appalachian Ohio was created.</p>
<p>Humble Play has had over 200 plays submitted over the past 6 years by playwrights both seasoned and aspiring from across the United States.  Each year the judges find it a daunting task to choose 4 plays out of all of the submissions.  Several of the plays presented at our festival go on to full productions with our festival being an important part of its development.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us to continue our festival with a donation - if you cannot, please share our campaign with your friends.  Thank you so much for helping the arts.</p>

<p>We are the Tempest Ladies, an all-female company devoted to making Shakespeare accessible to all through clear, engaging, and physical storytelling. The video above is a tease trailer for our new show--<em>Macbeth</em>--which just had three successful workshop performances. We want to bring <em>Macbeth </em>to audiences in Istanbul in April and mount our first-ever long run in New York City in June.</p>
<p><br/>We need our friends, families, fans, Shakespeare lovers, and strangers to come together and make it happen.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who are we and why are you reading this?</h3>
For almost 5 years, the Tempest Ladies have been bringing our unique productions to venues and underserved communities around the world.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Our previous production of <em>The Tempest</em> has played in Scotland as part of the Edinburgh Fringe; in Istanbul's Sevgi Gonul Theater Festival, we were its first American performers. We have also reached out to educational groups both here and abroad to create character and ensemble building workshops to complement our performances. We have worked with toddlers and, in our most rewarding challenge, high school students who had never interacted with Shakespeare and had limited English skills. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>We want to continue this journey with <em>Macbeth</em>. A favorite of many English and literature programs, the tragic and powerful tale is best understood through performance. The objective of the Tempest Ladies’ return trip to Istanbul is to perform <em>Macbeth</em> for the Turkish public and students throughout the region with discussion and workshops to follow. Following our trip, we want to secure a decent NYC space for 3 weekends to have a proper run of the show, inviting industry/press and marketing to the vast NYC arts community. Those of you who saw our workshops can attest that our approach to the text is unlike anything else offered by other classical companies.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You're reading this because we think you can help us get this done!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Okay, so how much do we need?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>The revenue from our workshop performances will go towards renting a venue for our 3 week-run in NYC this summer. Anyone active in the NY theater scene will know that most spaces charge around $3,000 per week. Therefore, the profit we recently made will be saved for now and used toward renting the theater for June.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The only expenses we have for our trip to Turkey are 6 airfares at $700 per person RT and $1000 for a theater rental. We have received funding for one plane ticket from one school so far and hope to receive more; as the departure date approaches, however, we do need to book our flights sooner rather than later. Any profits made from our trip to Istanbul will also go towards our June performance.</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Either way, your donation will go towards <em>Macbeth </em>and is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law, thanks to Fractured Atlas, our wonderful sponsor.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>So, what is the point of all this again?</h3>
<p>Our experiences over the last few years have changed us all as artists and people. We want to continue and expand and broaden our reach to influence more young people and remove the stuffy stigma of our language's greatest playwright. In convenient bullet-point form, we want:</p>
<ul>
<li>To give young people here and in Turkey the chance to see Shakespeare performed live and actually understand what's happening, and therefore to fall in love</li>
<li>To make <em>Macbeth</em> performances available in English to Turkish citizens and students, and show them that some 'Mericans are actually pretty cool</li>
<li>To make a mark on the NYC classical theater scene and occupy a niche we don't think has been filled in this community</li>
<li>To encourage women to seek endeavors (and roles) not usually meant for them</li>
<li>And finally, to keep the Bard's works alive, fresh, and wonderfully new for both well-versed and unfamiliar audiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>Told they were washing their sins away from lust, the girls were made to wash Ireland's laundry and at the same time fattening the Catholic Church's income. Suffering physical, emotional and mental damage, these institutions felt like prisons but were worse--there had been no trial, no sentence. Some of the girls were committed to the laundries for most of their lives.</p>

We would love for you to be a part of this team, a part in making sure this story is told.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>The primary purpose of this fundraiser is to help the MTC build a stage, setup lights and sound, and furnish the theatre.   We are working on a tight budget, but we want to work as best within our means to not let our financial limitations lower the quality of our services.  We want our classroom, rehearsal, and lounge areas to be comfortable, and we especially want our performance space to be a place that people enjoy performing in.<br/><br/>In addition, receiving financial support from a large amount of people is a sign of community support for the goals of the organization.  This support allows us to thrive and increase and improve the services we provide.</p>
<h2>Our Services</h2>
<h3>Master Classes</h3>
<p>These classes are for intermediate and advanced-level improvisers who are looking to compliment their current understanding of improvisation.  The unique thing about these classes is that every month, they are taught by a different teacher from a reputable LA improv school.  These are workshops that will challenge improvisers, help them integrate knowledge from different schools, and give them a broader perspective on improvisation.  In addition, these classes allow students to appreciate the wealth of diversity in improvisation.  Classes are $150 for four-weeks, but a sliding scale is available for students who have financial difficulty.</p>

<p><b>BIG KITCHEN </b>– <i>A COUNTER CULTURE MUSICAL</i> is
an evolving production about former Detroit social worker Judy Forman - aka Judy the Beauty on Duty - and
the inclusive community she has fostered at her eclectic southern California restaurant. Since 1980
Judy and the BK have been the center of the world for artists,
musicians, gays and lesbians, political activists, hungry people and seekers of all kinds. <br/></p>
<p><b>Every decade or so a work of art comes along that makes you feel glad to
 be a part of the human race. We feel this show has the potential to be 
that kind of work.</b><br/></p>
<p>THE SHOW features music written by long-time collaborators (and BK supporters!) Robert Schleeter and
Ricardo Pitts-Wiley. There’s something for everyone, from the swinging opener <i>Can
I Take Your Order?</i>, to the kitchen staff’s rocking declaration <i>I Wanna Be a
Star</i>, because after all, Whoopi Goldberg washed dishes there before her career took off. The personal and community impact of the AIDS crisis is reflected in the haunting ballad <i>If I</i>. Jerry Garcia’s influence can be heard in <i>Rollin’ Out</i>. And some songs that are just flat-out fun, like <i>We Was Humpin’</i> and <i>Judy Does
Paree. </i></p>
<p>THE CREATIVE TEAM: Bob Schleeter is a guitarist, producer and music educator. A graduate of Berklee College, he is the architect of one of the best popular music programs for high school students in the U.S. as part of Marin Academy in Marin County, California. Ricardo Pitts-Wiley is an acclaimed actor, playwright and director. The co-founder of Mixed Magic Theater in Rhode Island, Pitts-Wiley was a recent Martin Luther King Scholar at MIT in Cambridge. An outspoken advocate for cultural literacy, his page-to-stage adaptation (""remix"") of <i>Moby Dick</i> was presented at the Kennedy center in Washington, DC.<br/></p>
<p>Schleeter and Pitts-Wiley have been collaborators for more than 30 years. They've written four previous works for musical theater: Night Voices, Man Woman Chaos, The Spirit Warrior's Dream and Sara's Jukebox. Their shows have been produced at venues including The North Carolin Black Repertory Company, Shakespeare and Company, Brown University and the University of Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Author Corey Fayman has joined the team to collaborate on the script. Corey's 2nd novel, <i>Border Field Blues,</i> was a 
winner of the Genre
Award at the 2013 Hollywood Book Festival </p>
<p>
<b>We think the Big Kitchen stories are great
entertainment with a sense of purpose!!</b></p>
<p>GOALS: We've set a financial goal of $25,000 to fund a script workshop and workshop performance. We need high-quality actors, singers, musicians, a theater director, a rehearsal venue, and a workshop performance space. We've gotten this far on the good will of our friends and colleagues, but the material is ready to move to the next level. If we are short of our goal, we'll forge ahead and work with what we have.</p>
<p>IMPACT OF OUR PROJECT: This is an original work of music and theater, not a remake or an adaptation. The Big Kitchen is also an original. It is both unique and universal: everybody needs to eat, and most of us seek communities of some kind. But most cafe owners aren't social activists. 
Judy the Beauty believes in investing in people as opposed to stocks. Life experiences have
taught her that change comes from the grassroots....and she loves to water the
grass! Profits at the BK are measured in terms of
the impact on people’s lives. </p>
<p>We'll say it again: Every decade or so a work of art comes along that makes you feel glad to be a part of the human race. We feel this show has the potential to be that kind of work.</p>
<p>WHY WILL WE SUCCEED?: A quirky lead character who believes in something, a alternative and inclusive community of people who defy stereotypes, a bunch of songs you can't get out of your head, a reflection of the times we live in...you'll find all of this and more. </p>
<p><i>This is the story of a community. PLEASE JOIN US!!</i> You can help us with cash donations - large of small. Or you can help us get out our message to your own friends and co-workers.<br/></p>

<div>My name is Brendan Hunt. Three years ago I was dancing at sunrise at the Burning Man Festival in the Nevada desert.</div>
<p>When one dances in an alkali desert, you unavoidably kick up a bunch of dust; and I was kicking up so much of it... that I felt a little bit like Pigpen. </p>
<p>You remember Pigpen, right? From <i>Peanuts</i>?<i> </i>One of the second-tier members of the gang, known for his lack of hygiene and his ubiquitous cloud of dirt?<br/></p>
<p>While I was dancing there in dust, a story about Pigpen as an adult suddenly burst into my mind, fully formed.</p>
<p>But I wondered: if one was to try to play a Pigpen-like character- in, say, a play or something- how would one go about portraying that ever-present dust cloud?</p>
<p>Only one answer came to mind: a hula hoop. I would get a brown-and-black hula hoop, the least fabulous hula hoop possible, and that would probably do it. It would be kinetic, and it could be constant, while at the same time rocking the audience into a kind of sleep that would make them forget about it while the actual story- which is the far more important thing anyway- carried their primary attention. </p>

<p>The show would also be entered into that year's Hollywood Fringe Festival, where it won three more awards, including Best Comedy and Top of the Fringe, for best overall show.</p>
<p>It's a pretty good return for a simple cloud of dust.</p>
<p>Even after that, the show found further life. This year the play was selected for a short run at Orange County's prestigious South Coast Repertory, as part of their Studio SCR series.

<p>The New York International Fringe Festival (or FringeNYC) is a potential springboard for a show in a way that most Fringe festivals cannot hope to duplicate. Nonetheless, like all Fringe festivals, FringeNYC is a down-and-dirty, low-rent affair. We're doing a total of five shows over two weeks, with a bare-bones set and minimal tech.</p>
<p>As you may have heard, theatre is not exactly the highest-paying gig in show business. We are a cast of nine actors, plus a director and a stage manager, who intend to spend two-and-a-half weeks away from homes- and day jobs- for not much more pay than the thrill of doing a show in New York.</p>
<p>These are people who have been with <i>Filthy</i> since the beginning, folks who have been given ample chance to escape the project at each of its new steps along the way; but here they still are. I am awed by the fact that they are all willing to go along for this, the craziest step on the <i>Filthy</i> road yet. Everyone knows we won't be paid much, this is the life we chose; the least I can do is try to help insure that it doesn't cost them anything.</p>
<p>With this campaign we hope to cover everyone's flight east, so that no one has to pay their own way; then, once they're there, we'd like to make sure they eat.</p>
<p>It breaks down this way: </p>
<p>- we want to put $400 towards everyone's flights<br/>
- we want to give everyone $300 of food money<br/>
- that's $700 for 11 people, bringing us to a target of $7700</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal, we hope to make enough to at least put a dent in everyone's flight and food costs.</p>

My name is Brendan Hunt. Three years ago I was dancing at sunrise at the Burning Man Festival in the Nevada desert.
When one dances in an alkali desert, you unavoidably kick up a bunch of dust; and I was kicking up so much of it... that I felt a little bit like Pigpen.

The New York International Fringe Festival (or FringeNYC) is a potential springboard for a show in a way that most Fringe festivals cannot hope to duplicate. Nonetheless, like all Fringe festivals, FringeNYC is a down-and-dirty, low-rent affair. We're doing a total of five shows over two weeks, with a bare-bones set and minimal tech.

With this campaign we hope to cover everyone's flight east, so that no one has to pay their own way; then, once they're there, we'd like to make sure they eat.
It breaks down this way: 
- we want to put $400 towards everyone's flights
- we want to give everyone $300 of food money
- that's $700 for 11 people, bringing us to a target of $7700
If we don't make our goal, we hope to make enough to at least put a dent in everyone's flight and food costs.
But we don't expect you to just give out of the kindness of your heart*! We know you come to Indiegogo for one thing and one thing only- THE SWAG.
                               Yeah, SWAG! Tell us about THAT!
Your fully tax-deductible contribution may qualify you for PERKS! 
Our list of perks will expand as we go, so please keep checking back- but for now, here's what were starting with:
- your name in our show program, spelled correctly and everything
- a script autographed by the entire cast
- tickets to the show in New York
- a one-hour hula-hoop lesson
- a jersey signed by one of the greatest soccer players who ever lived
AND THAT'S NOT ALL! Or it won't be. For now, that is all. But there's totally more coming.





But why should I support this particular show?

I have been alerted that there may be some among you who also enjoy supporting art that may be deemed worthy of public consumption. 
In my experience, this has been a show that has surprised people with the degree to which it has affected them. It is a dark comedy, but also a deeply emotional show that gets audiences smiling and crying simultaneously.
Since those of us involved with the project cannot be trusted to speak objectively, I will direct your attention to the awards listed above, and to these reviews:
""Intense and compelling... An ambitious play... grandly served by the consistently pitch-perfect ensemble and inspired, imaginative direction."" - Myron Meisel, The Hollywood Reporter
""Absolutely stupendous... The ensemble performances are stellar."" - James Scarborough, The Huffington Post
""Darkly hilarious... comedy gold."" - Mayank Keshaviah, LA Weekly
(We would include a bad review to balance things out, but we never got one. BOOM.) 

More celebration; this time after the LA Weekly Awards, April 7, 2014.How else can I help?
If you can't contribute financially at this time, maybe just share our page with Indiegogo's share tools? That actually would be a huge help for us. Or...If you live in New York, and have an extra room or need for a house/pet-sitter for a few weeks in August, we have some nominees for your vacancy. :)On behalf of myself, the cast and the crew: thanks for getting dirty with us.- Brendan Hunt

<b>HELLO FRIENDS</b>! My name is Jennifer Polins, I have been the Artistic Director of the Pioneer Valley Performing Arts High School's Modern Dance Company, Catalyst Dancers for the past 12 years. Catalyst has been a cornerstone at PVPA and proof of the value of arts education in Western MA, since the schools inception in 1998. The Company consists of 12-18 young dancers that present student generated choreography as well as professional work by guests and faculty annually at PVPA's home theater and on national tours. Catalyst commissions works by many world renowned professional guest choreographers most recently, Catalyst had the honor of being the first high school to be allowed to stage Bill T Jones/Arnie Zane's “Continuous Replay”. The company has trained dancers who have gone on to dance with professional companies and productions such as CATS in New York, The Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, Lucinda Childs, Ballet Austin, Wally Cardona, David Newman, Renee Harris Pure Movement and Disney Tours, Pilobolous and Momix. Catalyst dancers have also received scholarships to dance conservatories such as Juilliard, SUNY Purchase, Goucher College, Connecticut College, Ohio State and University of the Arts, and received scholarships to Leon Dance, Summer Stages, Bates Summer Intensive, and Hubbard Street Summer Intensive. Catalyst gives students the rare opportunity to work with a cross culture of dancers, its members come from many dance studios in the region who would not normally get to meet, dance and work together. In short, Catalyst has been a catalyst for creativity, excellence, vision, and personal discovery that makes the art form of dance so vital, so compelling, and so ... essential.</li></ul><p></p><h3>Supporting Catalyst </h3><p></p><ul><li>

The project will be co-produced by US-based White Cloud Productions, Oscar International College of Film Studies and Narrator Theater Troupe in Nepal.


Robert will be teaching acting in Nepal again and will include the rehearsal and staging of this project as part of the curriculum. The Project will enable involvement from local students and teachers in terms of casting as well as technical support.


Your support is needed so we can successfully produce this play in Nepal about the private life of Mao.

A strong independent art community is part of what makes a strong democracy in any country; your funds will help Nepali art education and development, while at the same time support the staging of a new play about the private life of Mao in a country where Maoism is a growing part of its political life.What We Need & What You GetAll the funds will go toward the production and staging of the project. Robert is paying for his own travel and his expenses while in Nepal.
We need to rent a theater, design and produce sets and promote the production.
We would like to allow students and teachers to attend for free but that depends on how much funding we are able to raise.
We are offering simple rewards such as postcards, historical Mao souvenirs as well as dinner and meetings with Robert Lin (in the fall of 2014).
For those seeking to have a more lasting influence on democracy and art in Nepal we offer major endowment packages. 
The ImpactNepal is a fledgling democracy and its art movement is experiencing a revival.   :
Help us bring world class arts education to Nepal.
Share the stories about Mao's private life.

<p><br/>Someone once said the graveyard is the richest place in the world. It is full of inventions, products, ideas, goals and dreams that were never realized.  My goal is for my gravesite to be the poorest of all.

<p><br/>The show is more than mere entertainment it is a conduit for other to evaluate their relationship choices, to move beyond their fears and bring their own life’s goals and dreams to fruition.

<p><br/><em><strong>“Evolution of a Love Addict”</strong> </em>is taking on the theater festival circuit. Starting with our nations capital at The DC Black Theater Festival in June 2012.

As part of this years Melbourne Fringe Festival:Gemma Vs. The Normal Worms by Pachali Brewster is a thought provoking 'buddy adventure' which explores political and social themes. Originally written for screen, WORDOFMOUTH have re-imagined Gemma Vs. The Normal Worms for the theatre. They will stage this science fiction space odyssey at Irene's Warehouse, a community arts warehouse. In collaboration with local artists: puppets & their universe are re-purposed from recycled materials and salvaged objects.
SUSTAINABILITY! COMMUNITY!

Creating sets, puppets and props using salvaged objects found within our communities. We will recycle, upcycle and create!
Local artists are engaged to contribute and promote their own work through this process, this involves painters, performers, builders and musicians! (to name a few!)

Location is at local not-for-profit arts community warehouse so money is re-circulated into the local arts community.

Printing and advertising sourced through local companies
Lighting sourced through local companies

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After working with Robert D'Avanzo in his highly touted scene study and on-camera classes, James Lujan and Jordan McRae knew they wanted to put on a production of the very excellent play ""Red Angel"" by Eric Bogosian.  Along with Hallie Cooper and Dan Creed, the cast and director bring a solid collection of experience to The Missing Piece Theatre in Burbank for a 4 show/2 weekend run. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds we're looking for will help cover the rights and royalties due to Dramatists' Play Services in NYC, along with the rental of the theatre.  The rights and royalties are $600 total, and the theatre rental is $1200.  The remaining $700 is for publicity (posters, postcards, mailers), set furniture, lumber, hardware, costumes, and music.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We chose this play due to its uncanny ability to create recognition in everyone who reads and or sees it.  Bogosian's ""Red Angel"" delves into the anxiety in all of us - stemming from our past relationships, childhood, finanacial issues - all the while swallowing us whole in what is the temptation of a better life.</p>
<p>The director and actors chose this work, as it tells a REAL story, with just enough sex and comedy to make you think ""maybe not ALL theatre in LA is awful?""  Our primary goal, as Horace said, is to teach and entertain in order to have people leaving the theatre with a great conversation piece.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, hey... we get it.  Help us spread the word about the show!  It's only a 50 seat theatre, and we're running the last two weekends in June.  June 21, 22, 28, and 29th.  Tix are $15 at:</p>

<h2>""Do you ever wonder... how many times your life is gonna

</h2>
<h1>
</h1>
<h4> What do an Earth-mother-type teacher, her aging hippie husband, a flirty former actress, an introverted 16-year-old, and a divorced carpenter have in common? <br/>
</h4>
<h4>Very little.....or at
least that’s what they think until they take a six week community ""creative drama class"" and participate in acting games that become ever-more revealing and moving.  <br/>
</h4>
<h4>In this hilarious and touching play we catch glimpses of the poignant drama
that animates ordinary lives. <br/>
</h4>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>“When four lost New
Englanders - who enroll in Marty’s six-week-long community centre drama class -
begin to experiment with harmless games, hearts are quietly torn apart and tiny
wars of epic proportions are waged and won.<span>  A beautifully crafted diorama, a Petri dish in which we see,
with hilarious detail and clarity, the antic sadness of a motley quintet.” <br/></span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>-Dramatists Play Services<br/></span></i></b></p>

totally change and then, like, start all over again?”



 What do an Earth-mother-type teacher, her aging hippie husband, a flirty former actress, an introverted 16-year-old, and a divorced carpenter have in common? 

Very little.....or at
least that’s what they think until they take a six week community ""creative drama class"" and participate in acting games that become ever-more revealing and moving.  

In this hilarious and touching play we catch glimpses of the poignant drama
that animates ordinary lives. 



“When four lost New
Englanders - who enroll in Marty’s six-week-long community centre drama class -
begin to experiment with harmless games, hearts are quietly torn apart and tiny
wars of epic proportions are waged and won.  A beautifully crafted diorama, a Petri dish in which we see,
with hilarious detail and clarity, the antic sadness of a motley quintet.” 
-Dramatists Play Services

Called an “absorbing, unblinking and sharply funny play” by the New  York Times, Circle Mirror Transformation celebrates the subtle  and surprising power of creativity.
Critical Acclaim and Awards: 





Circle Mirror Transformation  was an Off-Broadway hit when it premiered in 2009.  It won the 2010 Obie Award  for Best New American Play.  

Voted one of the Top Ten Plays of 2009 by The New York Times, Time Out New
York, and The New Yorker.

“Circle Mirror
Transformation"" is deceptively simple
in structure, but it packs a terrific punch. It reminds us of our inescapable
need to come together and forge human connections — it reminds us, in short, of
the very power of theater. -- Entertainment
Weekly


""..an unheralded gem... immensely lovable new play""                              The New York Times
“Smartly, sneakily, Baker
gives us the rare theater-centric play that's not self-obsessed. Circle
Mirror Transformation is about real
people exploring their lives through tiny leaps of faith and creativity..”  Backstage



Cast & Creative:

Marty ..... Jill Harland
James ..... Mark Whelan
Schultz ..... David Frisch
Theresa ..... Pip Dwyer
Lauren ..... Laura Jabalee
Directed by Heather Braaten
Stage managed by  Kyra Ritchie


Designed by  Laird MacDonald

For those who do believe in fairies...

Our Project
Since its debut in 1904, Peter Pan written by the Scotsman J.M Barrie, has been a benchmark for the imagination and games for children, regardless of their generation, maintaining, after all these years, the firm belief that childhood is not  going anywhere as long we remember the existence of a distant place called “Neverland”.
In a country that needs to believe more than ever, we, a group of young people committed to the arts, decided to begin this project in the hope of rescuing the innocence of little children playing games and the need to believe for the young at heart, through the assembly of a musical inspired in fairies, pirates, Indians, family, children and, above all, the imagination.
Facing adversities and betting in favor of our country was really an easy decision for us to make; unfortunately, it wasn’t so easy to do so. That’s why we would like to invite you to help in our project (yes; yours and ours) so that it can be done. We invite you to... believe.
Who are we?
We have a cast of 15 people responsible for giving life to all those characters that accompanied our childhood. They are young people trained in the areas of singing, dancing and acting that work very hard to change other people’s lives. They are: Gabriel Scampini, Giza Pavone, Julián Izquierdo A., Jonathan Collet, Lorena Lezama, Alfredo Osiglia, Irene Casanova, Valeria Puchetti, Luis Fernando Sosa, Fabiola Muro, Isabella Cerullo and Carmen Linares.
An A-list creative team will be in charge of every artistic aspect of the show, complementing it with magic and illusion. Pedro Muñoz is the Art Director, Marlys Lares is the Producer, Taba Luis Ramirez is the Choreographer and Victoria Salomon is the Director of the play. Working with them are, Claudia Aguirre as the Costume Designer, Marianery Amin as the Makeup Artist, Daniel Antonini Zapata as the Music Director and Lissy García as the Stage Designer.

Vertigo is the only student theatre organization on the Northwestern campus that produces entirely student-written work.
Now in its 20th year of producing student-written works, Vertigo has an exciting season ahead and needs your help to get it going!   Bucky D's The first show of Vertigo's season, Bucky D's is a laugh-out-loud, side-splitting comedy! Set in a run-down arcade with a whole lot of heart, Bucky D's follows everyman Clu Flynn as he is forced to choose between attempting to save the struggling Scooter's Pizza Palace and selling out to the corporate Bucky D's. Along the way, we meet the loyal Jansen family, the enterprising Buckwaters, Mountain Dew addicts, quirky staff members, and of course, Scooter's animatronic band. Will Clu sell out or save Scooter's?
Performances are Thursday, September 25th at 10:00pm, Friday, September 26th at 8:00pm and 11:00pm, and Saturday, September 27th at 2:00pm and 8:00pm in Shanley Pavilion at Northwestern University. Tickets are $5.00 for Northwestern students, $10.00 for general public.
  Your Donation Your donations will help make Bucky D's and Vertigo's mission possible. Without contributions from people like you, there is no way we could continue to inspire student writers, directors, producers, designers, and performers. We value each and every donation, no matter how small, and thank you for your contribution to student theatre!

<p><b>Note from Director Guy Sprung:</b></p>
<p>In
Kafka’s original short story, Redpeter’s <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">journey
from Apehood to Humanhood </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">culminates
with him as a celebrated variety act </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">on
the stages of the world. Kafka’s themes of </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">assimilation,
freedom and civilization, posit the </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ultimate
irony that Redpeter as an ape was much more humane </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">than
any human. I have taken the liberty, for our </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">adaptation
of the story, to have Redpeter end up </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">as
a celebrated member of the ‘private security </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">industry’,
a euphemism that white-washes his reality </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">as
a mercenary soldier. Kafka, I hope, will not </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">object
too much to this contemporizing of his </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">work. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Redpeter has been assimilated into one of </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the
most heinous occupations that Homo Sapiens has
embraced, that of </span>privatizing<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the killing and the
subjugating of other human beings – for profit. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Just
as Redpeter, in the original,
had to distort his animal nature to be </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">accepted
into humanhood, so in our version, he </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">has

<div>Due to budgetary restrictions we are sending a lean and mean team of 1 stage manager, 1 technician and 1 actor to the Edinburgh Fringe. These are definitely among the hardest working people in existence and in order to keep them at their supernatural functioning levels, they need to eat. As you will have read in the majority of campaigns for the Edinburgh Fringe, Edinburgh thrives on it's tourism industry and that is reflected in the prices for food and most everything else. If we (conservatively) estimate food costs per person to be £25 per day (thats $47.57 CAD at the current exchange rate), we are easily looking at $4,281.30CAD for the 30 days they will spend away from home. If we do not reach our goal, all funds raised will go toward food costs, but if we do reach it, any remaining funds after food will be used to help with accommodation costs. </div>

</div>","The Project

We have been invited by Assembly Festival Ltd., the longest running and most prestigious of the multi-venue operators and promoters on the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, to perform Kafka's Ape at their venue:  George Square Studios - Five. Infinithéâtre and the Ape have toured within Canada before but bringing the show overseas is a new and exciting challenge. With a total of 24 performances over 26 days, it is an ambitious project to say the least. 
Kafka's Ape was first produced by Infinithéâtre in January 2013.  Due to popular demand, we remounted it in November 2013. After a successful run at the 2014 Toronto Summerworks Performing Arts Festival, Kafka's Ape completed a 1-month tour of Ontario & Québec, Canada in fall 2014. It was after completing that first tour that we had the confidence to bring the Ape to international stages.

""The first thing we notice about Kafka's Ape... is the eerie quality of the makeup and costumes ... The second remarkable thing... is Howard Rosenstein's uncanny mastery of the role of Mr. Redpeter""                                                                               -Pat Donnelly, Montreal Gazette
                     
Captured on the Gold Coast and imprisoned in a cage, Redpeter's only escape route is to become a walking, talking, spitting, hard-drinking member of the Peace Industry, the entrepreneurial world of mercenary soldiers that is one of the biggest growth industries of the 21st century. In detailing the journey of his enforced evolution from Apedom to Humandom, Mr. Redpeter is a living embodiment of the irony that perhaps now he is more animal than he ever was as an Ape. Based on Kafka’s short story A Report for an Academy. 


 





Note from Director Guy Sprung:
In
Kafka’s original short story, Redpeter’s journey
from Apehood to Humanhood culminates
with him as a celebrated variety act on
the stages of the world. Kafka’s themes of assimilation,
freedom and civilization, posit the ultimate
irony that Redpeter as an ape was much more humane than
any human. I have taken the liberty, for our adaptation
of the story, to have Redpeter end up as
a celebrated member of the ‘private security industry’,
a euphemism that white-washes his reality as
a mercenary soldier. Kafka, I hope, will not object
too much to this contemporizing of his work. 
Redpeter has been assimilated into one of the
most heinous occupations that Homo Sapiens has
embraced, that of privatizing the killing and the
subjugating of other human beings – for profit. Just
as Redpeter, in the original,
had to distort his animal nature to be accepted
into humanhood, so in our version, he has
to distort his ape nature even more to become a successful
corporate military citizen. A good 85% of the
text is still true to the original story. I have blended in
the dark humour and the central maxim of “obedience”
from one of Kafka’s other stories, In The Penal Colony.                                                  
                                                 

The image of the Statue of Liberty with a sword, not a
torch, in her hand (which is the logo of Redpeter’s employer,
Graywater Corporation) we took from a description
of the statue in Kafka’s unfinished novel, Amerika.
Kafka’s central thesis, that other animals have
a dignity and a respect for their own species which
Homo Sapiens, on its evolutionary journey, has
lost, has been nudged into the 21st Century.

What We Need
Touring a show, even a small one like Kafka's Ape, is expensive. Touring a show internationally - even more so. With this campaign we are aiming to raise $5,000, which represents roughly 11% of the total cost for this project. We have been working our tails off since January to raise the funds necessary to cover registration, shipping/building our set, paying and transporting our hard working crew and advertising. The $5,000 that we raise with this campaign will go towards the cost of food and accommodations for our traveling crew of 3.
Due to budgetary restrictions we are sending a lean and mean team of 1 stage manager, 1 technician and 1 actor to the Edinburgh Fringe. These are definitely among the hardest working people in existence and in order to keep them at their supernatural functioning levels, they need to eat. As you will have read in the majority of campaigns for the Edinburgh Fringe, Edinburgh thrives on it's tourism industry and that is reflected in the prices for food and most everything else. If we (conservatively) estimate food costs per person to be £25 per day (thats $47.57 CAD at the current exchange rate), we are easily looking at $4,281.30CAD for the 30 days they will spend away from home. If we do not reach our goal, all funds raised will go toward food costs, but if we do reach it, any remaining funds after food will be used to help with accommodation costs. 

Impact
Participating in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival would grab some attention for Québec English-Language theatre on international stages. Infinithéâtre believes that Québec is teeming with talented playwrights and top-notch plays and we are committed to having our work noticed both nationally and internationally. This is a big year for Québec theatre at the Fringe - with a handful of other companies from the province performing alongside us in the festival, our province is being solidly represented.

<h2>The People</h2>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Stillpointe is a group of writers, performers, musicians, singers, actors, technicians, and theatre enthusiasts working and living in the Baltimore area.  While they all come from various artistic backgrounds and disciplines, they were brought together by a belief that theatre should be magical, moving, and above all, an escape.  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A sensory-filled world where the audience could come and forget about their daily troubles, even if only for a moment. The Stillpointe Theatre Initiative was created to promote the art of re-imagining the old and creating the new.  Years have passed, our size has expanded, and like-minded dreamers have joined this ever-growing Co-op of exciting NEW theatre.</span></p>

<h2>The Productions</h2>
<p>It has now been THREE years Since our humble beginnings and Stillpointe has produced over 15 pieces of theatre.  Productions have ranged from classical plays, such as <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Titus Andronicus, The Country Wife </i>and<b> <i>Arsenic and Old Lace</i>,</b> to contemporary plays and musicals written by local (Baltimore) and non local (New York) playwrights, such as Kimberley Lynne's <i><b>The Return of the 5th Sister</b></i> , Ryan Scott Oliver's<b><i> 35MM, </i></b> Kirsten Child's <i><b>The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds her Chameleon Skin </b></i>and Stillpointes own original musical, <b><i>Shovel in the Dirt</i></b>.

<h2>The Cause</h2>
<p>Stillpointe has been lucky enough to to join the ranks of the Baltimore Theatre Community, a very vast, diverse, and rapidly-growing group of artists that are united in their vision of beautifying and diversifying the city of Baltimore.  We strive to make every production more engaging than the last, and in order to do so, budgets must also rise.  H<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">owever, the money spent on sets, costumes, lights, props, rental fees, </span>licensing costs<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, printing, and advertising is only done in service to our main goal as an artistic group.  Since the very beginning, Stillpointe has striven to treat each artist we work with as professionally as possible.  Recently, we have begun to offer each artist (musician,actor,director,designer technician, etc.) a stipend for their work with our company.  Although this gesture is gratifying, well-deserved, and entirely necessary, we find ourselves now turning to you, the audience members, most of whom have been with us since the very beginning, to give just a bit more.  We are asking you, our audience base, for $10,000.  This money will go towards producing our largest season to date.  With your help, we can keep our tickets prices affordable, while still providing you with the same high-caliber theatre and hospitality you have come, or will come, to expect from Stillpointe.  Our upcoming season, simply titled ""Feed Your Obsession"", will shock, excite, and provoke your senses with a fun, fancy, affordable night at the theatre.  </span></p>

</div></div>","This year marks the 35th Anniversary of the Anahid Sofian Dance Company based in New York City, and we are celebrating this milestone with a Gala performance at the Manhattan Music and Art Center on June 28 and 29, 2014.“Ms. Sofian has worked tirelessly to present Middle eastern dance in all its many forms”--Robert H. Browning, Executive & Artistic Director, World Music Institute
The Company specializes in dances of the Near and Middle East including many variations on Raqs Sharqi, known in the West as ""bellydance."" Since its professional debut at Carnegie Hall in 1980, the Company has been instrumental in presenting music and dances inspired by cultures as diverse as the gypsies of Turkey to the Awalim style harem dancers of Egypt. “We would recommend and support any project that theCompany undertakes.”--Alan Pally, Manager of Public Programs, The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts
The Company covers a wide range from traditional to contemporary interpretations, resulting from Ms. Sofian’s training in ballet and modern dance. While drawing inspiration from the rich diversity of Middle Eastern cultures, integrating it with artistic elements of Western dance styles has made the Company’s works accessible to a broader audience. The Company is proud to have performed at venues including Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors, the Cleveland Museum of Arts, and have participated in programs including the Downtown Dance Festival and Women’s History Month.The Company has also premiered two acclaimed off-Broadway productions, Marrakech: Inside the Magic Circle at Baruch Performing Arts Center (2005), and Passage Through Light and Shadows: The Children of Ararat at the Theatre of St. Clements Church (2010).The Company will showcase 14 representative numbers at the Gala Show. Featuring over 25 dancers and musicians, there will be folkloric dances—a powerful tribal dance from Morocco and women’s dances from Armenia that reflect grace and lyrical beauty. Contemporary pieces include a dance inspired by an old Greek song sung by Irini Pappas, and a dream-like interpretation of ""Gazli,"" written and sung by the young Uzbeki star, Sevara Nazarkhan. Guest artists include Nourhan Sharif and Dancers, Sera Solstice Ensemble, and Carlos Fittante and Robin Gilbert of BALAM Dance Theatre.

“Sofian and her dancers evoked the bazaar, thenightclub, the harem—and also something essentially female, essentially powerful, that transcends the mercantile.”--Elizabeth Zimmer, Dance Magazine



The cost of the two-day show is $25,000. We expect to raise $15,000 through ticket sales, fund-raising events and already committed donations.We are still short $10,000 and need your help.
Your contribution will not only go toward a dance company with a solid track record of quality productions, but one with a unique and important imprint on the cultural history of New York and beyond. 
        

We have some limited number of very special perks. Donate early!  Even sharing this link with all your friends goes a very long way. Thank you for sharing and re-posting! 
Not a good time? No worries. Even after the campaign expires, you can still donate by contacting us directly.

<p><strong><em>Dig Infinity!</em></strong> is the story of Lord Buckley (1906-1960), a nearly forgotten jazz comedian, visionary storyteller/philosopher, hipster saint, and premier beatnik rapper. Lord Buckley was best known for transforming Bible stories, Shakespeare soliloquies, myth, legend and history into one-of-a-kind hip-talk monologues combining black street argot and the King’s English into a jazzy patois and worldview that anticipated psychedelia and rap by decades.</p>
<p>What makes Lord Buckley’s life and art still so resonantly timely and why each new generation seems to rediscover and revere his legacy are the ways in which it confronts and comments on controversial components of contemporary American life: religion, politics, language, art, sex, drugs and (most slaiently)... race.</p>
<p>Yet despite being a secret bohemian hero to the likes of Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Lenny Bruce, Grateful Dead, Robin Williams, George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, and scores of others, Buckley's legacy has remained tragically underacknowledged.</p>
<p>As Lord Buckley's biographer and a keeper of the flame, I have shared His Lordship's work in a variety of settings and media for more than two decades.</p>
<p>We are all proud that <em><strong>Dig Infinity!</strong></em> has been selected to be presented at this year's Planet Connections Festivity -- NYC's premier eco-friendly/socially-conscious arts festival. Fostering a diverse cross-section of performances, the Festivity seeks to inspire artists and audiences both creatively and fundamentally, in a festive atmosphere. At the heart of the Festivity are like-minded individuals striving to create professional, meaningful theatre, film, music and art while supporting organizations which give back to the community at large.</p>

<p><em><strong>Dig Infinity!</strong></em> is a play drawn from my research invoking the Buckley muse in lively and surreal fashion. After presenting a staged reading in the autumn of 2012, the play has been selected to again be presented as a staged reading at the Planet Connections Festivity in June 2013.</p>
<p>I have assembled a dedicated and talent circle of actors and crew who have thus far worked for the love of the project. In addition to compensating them for their time and efforts, I will need to rent rehearsal space and projection equipment to present a staged reading in the most compelling and transformative manner possible.</p>
<p>The tentative cast, crew and main roles are as follows:</p>
<p><span><strong>Cast</strong></span><br/><span>Oliver Trager … Lord Buckley</span><br/><span>Russell Jordan… Orpheus</span><br/><span>Katie Baker… Lady Elizabeth Buckley, Ensemble</span><br/><span>Michael Fiorillo… Mink Head, Ensemble</span><br/><span>Ian Finkel… God, Ensemble</span><br/><span>Ridley Parson… Folkie Man, Ensemble</span><br/><span>David Lamberton… Narrator, Jazzbo</span></p>
<p><span><span>John Kruth (Music)</span><br/><span>Eric Feldman (Lighting and Design)</span><br/><span>Leyla Modirzadeh (Lighting and Design)</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Dig Infinity!</em></strong> unfolds on four interdependent and intermingling levels: a real-time Lord Buckley performance, an interview with Orpheus (the mythological Greek poet and musician here imagined as a wizened jazz musician), visual representations of Buckley’s more famous pieces, and flashbacks visiting each epoch of his career.</span></p>
<p><span>Lord Buckley’s jazz club performance (which turns out to be his last) introduces most of the major characters in the film, creates a central locale to which the main story periodically returns, and allows the audience a glimpse and appreciation of Buckley’s act up-close and personal.</span></p>
<p><span>The midnight interview with Orpheus takes place in a surreal radio station. As Buckley tells his life story via flashbacks and demonstrates his art via stylized visual representations of his material, he also engages in a cat-and-mouse argument with Orpheus as the edgy elements of his life and art are bared. This dialogue evolves into the play’s dramatic crisis -- complete with a journey to Hades and a cameo by God -- as it becomes increasingly apparent that Buckley is bargaining for his very soul.</span></p>
<p><span>The visual representations of Buckley’s material strive to match the tone of each specific piece with a cinematic environment that best represents its atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span>The flashbacks visit each phase of Buckley’s career: childhood, minstrelsy, the dance marathons, Capone’s Prohibition-era Chicago, the black church, the Swing band era, bebop, and the Beat Generation. Each flashback at once demonstrates the evolution of his art, reveals his self-destructive tendencies, and establishes the liaisons which inspire and destroy him.</span></p>
<p><span>I wish I had the time, energy and resources to produce a slick and fancy video to make the pitch Mad Ave. style -- just the little clip above a friend caught at our staged reading of the play presented in conjunction with the Red Harlem Readers at the Indian Cafe on Upper Broadway in early November 2012. And a nice review of the show that might give you an better sense of its power and potential can be found on this wonderful blog: <a href=""http://hannahmenziesblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/dig-infinity-lord-buckley-gets-mythical-at-the-indian-cafe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://hannahmenziesblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/06/dig-infinity-lord-buckley-gets-mythical-at-the-indian-cafe/</a></span></p>

At the age of three I was so full of energy I could never sit still, so I began taking gymnastics classes and joined a bumper bowling league. This wasn't enough so I also began little league baseball. I excelled at all of these activities and even when I broke my collarbone on the first day of baseball season, I wouldn't let it stop me. At five years old, I tumbled my way into the dance studio. Baseball, bowling and dance were now competing for my full attention. Though I can hold my own on the field and in the lanes, I felt more at home on stage. <br/>
After the first dance studio I attended closed when I was 9,<br/>
I spent the next year traveling 120 miles every day in order to continue my training. I also competed throughout this year for my first time, while still maintaining my grades at school. <br/>
It was towards the end of that year when I decided that I wanted to truly follow my dream of becoming a professional dancer and I convinced my family to move to Las Vegas so I could be closer to the dance studio and surround myself with industry professionals. <br/>
For the past four years I've been training, competing and winning awards in Las Vegas. <br/>
I've had many opportunities in the last four years. I've performed at Disneyland, competed at several regional competitions and attended many conventions where I've met and trained with Robert Hoffman, Mia Michaels, Mandy Moore, Brian Friedman, Tyce Diorio, Rosero McCoy, Ian Eastwood, Brooke Lipton, Trisha Miranda and Dave Scott, just to name a few. <br/>
This year, I won a scholarship and earned the chance to train in Southern California at a six day summer dance intensive called JUMP. <br/>
I'm asking for your help to raise enough money to cover travel and lodging for the convention. <br/>
The chance to continue training with Mia Michaels, Mandy Moore, Travis Wall, Stacy Tookey, Twitch, Willdabeast and many more, will just help enhance my training and continue to let my God-given talent soar. <br/>
Thank you for taking the time to read about me and my goals. Any help you are willing to give will be greatly appreciated, even if it's sharing my link to others.</p><p>Thomas Wright</p><p></p></div>","Hello, my name is Thomas Wright.

Their goal is to create quality productions that draw audiences that do not typically attend theatre.  Our unique blend of film and stage creates the fast pace action that movie goers are used to, with the human element you can only find in live theatre. Previous hit productions include ""<a href=""http://zombies.brentfelzien.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">For The Love of A Zombie</a>,"" 2009, ""<a href=""http://www.accidentalhumour.com/?cat=15"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Happy Whackin' Jim McCrackin</a>'"" 2010, and ""<a href=""http://www.accidentalhumour.com/?cat=30"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Cowboy: A Cowboy Story</a>"" 2011.<br/><br/>Our 2012 project entitled ""Hero Quest"", thrusts our comedic style into the Fantasy genre.  There will be dwarves, there will be wizards, there will be elves, and there will be Neil LeGrandeur!  Fantasy at its best.  This otherworld production is set to tour Alberta this summer in Edmonton, Calgary, and Lethbridge, with more locations in the works. Updates on additional stops will be posted as booked.</p>

<p>Let's not mince words; our shows cost a lot of money.

This self-destructive behaviour results in two things: empty bank accounts, and amazing theatre spectacles!<br/><br/>We want you to help us with the empty bank account problem. In order for our company to continue to grow and make creative, cutting-edge theatre, we need the support of wonderful people like you. We do it for the love and for the joy we get from sharing our work with you.<br/><br/>Every penny we receive from you goes directly into upgrading our equipment and bringing our new production to life. We have a lot of work to do before then, so any help you can offer will go a long way!</p>

Our last 5 days of campaign are here.  So we want to really see how much money we can raise for our next production!  That's why we have reduced the donation amounts of our two highest Perks (Dragon and The Goat)!
Please have a look at the new affordable donation perks!


We've chosen the title of the play!  Our show title place holder was ""Hero Quest,"" but we knew that wasn't going to cut it.  So from the drawing board we've come up with... ""Son of a Dwarf!""  It's fresh, it's fantasy, it's going to be freaking awesome!  

WEEKLY TICKET DRAW UPDATE:
This Weeks Winner: Steven Tran
Who are we?Accidental Humour Co. is an Albertan based Theatre company that has been making great multimedia theatre since they first met at a Dairy Queen in Lethbridge back in 2005. Their goal is to create quality productions that draw audiences that do not typically attend theatre.  Our unique blend of film and stage creates the fast pace action that movie goers are used to, with the human element you can only find in live theatre. Previous hit productions include ""For The Love of A Zombie,"" 2009, ""Happy Whackin' Jim McCrackin'"" 2010, and ""Cowboy: A Cowboy Story"" 2011.Our 2012 project entitled ""Hero Quest"", thrusts our comedic style into the Fantasy genre.  There will be dwarves, there will be wizards, there will be elves, and there will be Neil LeGrandeur!  Fantasy at its best.  This otherworld production is set to tour Alberta this summer in Edmonton, Calgary, and Lethbridge, with more locations in the works. Updates on additional stops will be posted as booked.
 

Happy Whackin' Jim McCrackin, 2010 and Cowboy: A Cowboy Story, 2011            
Ok... Why do we need your help?
Let's not mince words; our shows cost a lot of money. Marrying both theatre and movies doubles our production costs, not to mention we are always pushing to top ourselves in both style and substance. This self-destructive behaviour results in two things: empty bank accounts, and amazing theatre spectacles!We want you to help us with the empty bank account problem. In order for our company to continue to grow and make creative, cutting-edge theatre, we need the support of wonderful people like you. We do it for the love and for the joy we get from sharing our work with you.Every penny we receive from you goes directly into upgrading our equipment and bringing our new production to life. We have a lot of work to do before then, so any help you can offer will go a long way!

Well, what are we going to do with that money?Funding from this campaign will be used towards our next production.  We are asking for $5000.00 which is less than half of what the company has contributed in the past.  Why do we need more money, you ask?  We always want to make a bigger, better, and more entertaining product for you, our audience.  Unfortunately, we cannot afford to make it happen on our own. Here is a breakdown of where all $5000.00 is going.Projection Screen: $500.00We are more than doubling the size of our projection screen, to accommodate more elaborate projections, and more stage and film integration.Projector: $3500.00We need to upgrade our Projector to match the size of our screen, and ensure the image is bright and clear for audience to see.Show Props: $1000.00This includes but is not limited to stage combat grade fantasy weaponry (swords, axes, staffs, knives, shields), and construction of ""dummy bodies"" to use as stunt doubles, instead of placing our actors in the line of danger (we have been there and done that, and we are running out of actors).Above and Beyond $5000.00Any donations above and beyond our goal will also be going toward ""Hero Quest,"" in the form of costumes, sets, promotional media, film locations, venue rentals, touring costs, and most importantly paying the artists! If we are unable to reach our entire goal, the donations we do receive will be going towards projector and screen costs before anything else.  We are grateful for any donations we receive.  Here are some more details on the Perks for your donations!$10 - Wood Gnome - Pretty much explained to the right, every little bit helps us, and we are very thankful for any contribution people can give.  Your name will appear in the Thank You section of our website, we'll probably yell it from the roof tops to boot.

$100 - Giant - You will receive all of our previous Production Diaries, which brings you behind the scenes on the creation of our three previous productions.  Plus you still receive your choice of poster, a thank you in our Playbill, and a button.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are two polyamorous trans ladies who are in love and want to party about it with all of our diverse and wonderful families. We want to make sure we can afford to rent an accessible, safe place for our ceremony.  Plus, our guests are traveling from all over to join our wonderful, queer chosen family and we want to give them food and shelter when they get here.<br/></p>
<p>We're also working-class grrrls who give a lot to our communities and are broke. Show us some solidarity and mutual aid cause we don't get paid enough for our hard work! :)</p>

Less than two years ago, Sky Candy started with an 18 foot tall A-frame aerial rig and a dream.  Today, Sky Candy is Austin's most celebrated aerial arts studio and troupe with acknowledgement as Austin's Best Circus Art Revivalists (Austin Chronicle Best of Austin 2011).  We've grown from teaching classes outdoors during an unforgiving Texas summer, with lots of sunblock, bug spray and misters - to filling our very own 2400 square foot studio complete with climate control!  However, when we want to take our show on the road, we are still relegated to our old friend - the A-frame rig.

Extending 25 feet into the air, Aeria is a wholly unique and elegant aerial rig, constructed by the immensely talented Rich Martin, founder of Opulent Temple at Burning Man, now doing his own design work as Fury Six Design.  The structure would allow Sky Candy to perform more outdoor performances on a structurally sound, artistically aspirational work. 



The Impact
With this new aerial rig, Sky Candy will be able to perform in a wider variety of outdoor and indoor venues that do not have sufficiently safe rigging options.  Our current rig has served us well, but can only be used on soft, even ground outside.  Having Aeria would mean more performances in more places!  Furthermore, Aeria is considerably taller than Sky Candy's current rig, allowing us to perform a greater range of dynamic tricks and drops, particularly on the silks and corde lisse/rope.  Additionally, Aeria will become a key fixture of Burning Flipside and Spin Camp for years to come.

<h3>We are the Drexel Players!</h3>
<p>As the university's only undergraduate theatre student organization, The Drexel Players apply foundations in art, science, and industry to engage students in the creation of fresh and thrilling ensemble work. Drawing from a core of artists and collaborators with interdisciplinary backgrounds, we strive to empower student theatre artists, to stimulate audiences, and to ignite a passion for theatre in all.</p>
<h3>And we are RETURNING to the Philadelphia Fringe Festival...</h3>
<p>Last year we united against the hole in the sky in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QClVsmVx5KQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MONUMENT</a>.</p>
<p>This year we are pulling together again as a community of student artists of all backgrounds and disciplines to devise another original piece for the 2013 Philadelphia Fringe Festival.</p>
<h3>Our show is entitled ""Parts: A Speed-Through""...</h3>
<p><span>""It's Hell Week. You suffer rivals, make friends, and make believe. It happens, it ends, and you leave. The Drexel Players invite you to belong, just for a moment, and experience an interactive orignal work about the parts we play, the parts we hide, and the parts we can never forget.""</span></p>

We are the Drexel Players!
As the university's only undergraduate theatre student organization, The Drexel Players apply foundations in art, science, and industry to engage students in the creation of fresh and thrilling ensemble work. Drawing from a core of artists and collaborators with interdisciplinary backgrounds, we strive to empower student theatre artists, to stimulate audiences, and to ignite a passion for theatre in all.
And we are RETURNING to the Philadelphia Fringe Festival...
Last year we united against the hole in the sky in MONUMENT.
This year we are pulling together again as a community of student artists of all backgrounds and disciplines to devise another original piece for the 2013 Philadelphia Fringe Festival.
Our show is entitled ""Parts: A Speed-Through""...
""It's Hell Week. You suffer rivals, make friends, and make believe. It happens, it ends, and you leave. The Drexel Players invite you to belong, just for a moment, and experience an interactive orignal work about the parts we play, the parts we hide, and the parts we can never forget.""
The piece is a theatrical ""undressing"" about the unique, beautiful, and tragic relationships young artists share with each other and will be loosely based on the stories, rituals, and experiences of the Drexel Players. We are in the process of devising and writing it as an ensemble currently.
And we are half-way there!
So far we have secured our registration fee, a venue for the event (The URBN Annex Black Box Theatre in University City), our insurance fee, and a modest budget for artist fees.
Here's what we need...


$500 - Food Items: Our show will incorporate food and drink very purposefully as a part of our story telling. Certain consumables will be shared with the audience and will be crucial to key moments of our piece. We will need to purchase enough for rehearsals and performances.

</p>
<p>Hi, you wonderful Indiegogo supporters.  We are in the midst of creating a brand new
musical revue about the fair city called Los Angeles – the title of our show is
L.A. Now and Then – a celebratory and contrasting look at the city that was and
the city that is.  The show is conceived
and directed by Bruce Kimmel, who has also written some songs and
sketches.  Additional great collaborators
include Richard M. Sherman (of the Sherman Brothers), Bruce Vilanch, Paul
Gordon, Michele Brourman, Shelly Markham, Adryan Russ, Doug Haverty, Lissa
Levin, Gary Stockdale and others.  The
production will take place at Los Angeles City College, where author Kimmel
attended (as did contributors Paul Gordon and Gary Stockdale).  </p>
<p>We are very excited about this show and its potential as a
perennial valentine to L.A.  If you loved
things past you’ll hear about them here – the show will be funny, touching,
illuminating, and covers the 1940s up through now.  The songs are tuneful and wonderful, and the
monologues, scenes, and sketches will take you on a journey through the most
amazing one-off city in the world.  From
the opening number (“This Is the City”) to the paean to the much-missed C.C.
Brown’s, to a kaleidoscopic portrait of the Sunset Strip circa 1965 to 1968, to
the Golden Age of Los Angeles wrestling, to a history of the gay scene from its
hidden beginnings to its proud coming out and beyond, to the infamous Black
Dahlia, to the artistic haven that was Laurel Canyon in the 60s and 70s, to the
more current scene, if you love L.A. you will love L.A. Now and Then.  Our endgame for this show is to get the city
involved in funding a sit-down production.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>The purpose for doing the Indiegogo campaign is simple:
Community colleges, especially in the arts, are having hard times, with barely
enough budget allocations to produce a normal season of theater.  Los Angeles City College has been one of the
foremost theater arts departments in the nation for over eight decades, with
such stellar alumni as Donna Reed, Alexis Smith, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn,
Cindy Williams, Diana Canova, Debbie Gravitte, Mark Hamill, Clint Eastwood,
Morgan Freeman, Paul Winfield, Michael Lembeck, and many, many other show
business notables.  Because musicals,
especially new musicals, are expensive to produce we are trying to raise
$12,500 (the bare minimum we need - more would even be more helpful), which will pay for the band and the sound package we’ll need.  The department simply has no budget for that
kind of thing anymore.  So, we need your
help!</p>
<p>We have devised a set of perks that we hope will make
contributing fun and easy.  While the
department can’t really give away tickets for this campaign (they live and
breathe by box-office sales), we’ve come up with some perks that will hopefully
appeal to you, that cover every budget range. 
Please check them out – they’re over there on the right.  There’s everything from a season pass to the
LACC shows (which are really good), to CD packages from Kritzerland, to
receiving the cast album we’ll be recording, to being an associate or full
above-the-title producer, to thank yous in the program, to sheet music from the
show, to a signed musical quote by Richard M. Sherman (song of your choice), to a head shot photography session, coaching sessions, and for those with cash to spare you
can have a wonderful dinner with the legendary Richard M. Sherman and Bruce
Kimmel at a great restaurant.   </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>This show has the potential to become a long-running LA
tourist event, something that out-of-towners can see when visiting, as well as
the millions of Angelinos who live here, who love the melting pot that is this
city.  The band is a hugely important
part of the show, as is the sound package rental, something the theater
department simply doesn’t have.  The show
is also important to the college – an original musical with some amazing
writers, performed by an all-student company. 
It will also be eligible for the American College Theater Festival.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Doing a new musical is always a risk and a challenge, but
the team behind this musical has had many huge successes over the years, both
here and elsewhere.  The biggest
challenge is overcoming the budgetary restraints of community college arts
programs, which is, at this point in time, shamefully low.  That is where we need your help so very
badly.  Whatever perk you choose, the
money will help us do this production the right way.  The students will have a once-in-a-lifetime
experience of working on the creation of a brand new musical.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We understand how many of these campaigns there are and how
many are asking for your dollars.  Again,
we’ve tried to make the perks make sense – so you’re actually getting some
stuff that doesn’t have to come out of the LACC budgets – things like the
coaching sessions and the headshot photography are being donated by people who
believe in this project.   If you find yourself unable to donate, you can
still help by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter and other social media,
especially to the L.A.-centric Facebook groups, of which there are many.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>      My name is Skye Van Rensselaer. My passion for theater was born here on St. Thomas at the Pistarckle Theater. When I was 8 years old, I participated in their first summer camp and played Peaseblossom in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. For the last four years, I have been extremely fortunate to attend Skidmore College in upstate New York, and in May 2013 I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science, and Honors in Theater Arts. My dream is to start my own theater company, with a focus on creating new and innovative theater. In addition to the training I received in all areas of Theater Arts in the Skidmore Theater department, I was selected for a theater program in my junior year at the Moscow Art Theater in Russia. This was a life changing experience that truly engaged me in a performance model that pushed me intellectually, physically and emotionally in ways I could not have imagined.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get &amp; The Impact</h3>
<p>     I received the news a few days ago, that I have been invited to attend a nine month intensive acting conservatory program with one of my favorite theater companies, SITI Company, which will start this fall in New York City. Twenty actors, of all ages, from all over the world have been selected for this inaugural conservatory program and I feel very honored and humbled to be among the group. Never in my life have I been exposed to such a fantastic group of theater artists. They are driven, hard working, intellectual, and challenging. I had the opportunity to train with them last summer, and, once again, I was pushed way beyond my bounds - body, mind, and spirit. Their training, a combination of Suzuki and Viewpoints, unlocks something powerful inside of me. It ignites my passion. It is constantly challenging me without a second to rest in it: testing my determination and will, and strengthening all parts of my ‘performing’ self. I know that attending the training program in the fall is 100% the next step I need to take in my professional theatrical training. It is going to provide me with tools, skills, ideas, and opportunities that I wouldn’t be able to get anywhere else and it will provide me with a great foundation to make my dream of creating my own theater company a reality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>      Like many things in this world, it comes with a fairly high cost with not a lot of time to pay it. I have $12,000 dollars left to pay towards my tuition by August 15<sup>th</sup>.  While I am working two jobs this summer to make and save as much as possible, it is not going to be anywhere near $12,000. Once the program starts, it will be intensive, but I will be working at least one or two nights a week to help pay my living expenses in the City. I am reaching out to as many people in my community for thoughts, ideas, grants, loans; anything to help make this opportunity a reality. I am a hard working, passionate, and determined individual and I am eternally grateful to my Virgin Islands community where I was born and raised, which has helped mould and develop the values I hold today. Once I have acquired the tools I need, I plan to create a way to share what I have learned with young people here at home. Theater helped save my life and I want to provide others with the same opportunity.</p>
<p>    I truly appreciate you taking the time and care to read this. Please let me know if you are interested in working with me to help me make this happen. I am open to all creative financing ideas. SITI Company is a non-profit 501C3 classified organization. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Following our sold out reading at Dixon Place this past January, we are currently developing our play, Bad Egg, as Artists-in-Residence at The Tank NYC. The Tank has granted us meeting, rehearsal, and performance space so that we can develop the script. Our Winter development period will culminate in a Works in Progress showing on April 27, 2019 @ 3:00, which we are raising funds to support.</p>
<p><i>About  Us: </i></p>
<p><strong>Michelle Tailor</strong> is an Artist-in-Residence at The Tank NYC. She received her MFA in Acting from the University of Florida and teaches theatre at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in New York. Michelle’s artistic and academic focus has been on feminist performance practices, including a guest artist lecture on ""Performing Feminism: Gestus and Top Girls by Caryl Churchill"" at Franklin and Marshall College in the department of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. Michelle’s fiction writing can be seen in The Windsor Review. She is a company member of The Hippodrome Theatre. SAG-AFTRA/AEA. </p>
<p><strong>Megan Pinto</strong> is an Artist-in-Residence at The Tank NYC. She is also a Playmakers Playwright and Resident Artist at the Purple Rose Theatre Company, where she wrote and developed <i>Winter in Eden,</i> which was seen at Dixon Place this past Spring. She received her MFA in Poetry from Warren Wilson, and her poems are forthcoming in <i>Ploughshares, Four Way Review, </i>and <i>Indiana Review.</i> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We aim to raise $2,600. This money will support costs for:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 Actors</li>
<li>Lighting Designer </li>
<li>Movement Choreographer</li>
<li>Fight Choreographer</li>
<li>Stage Manager</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Poster Creation</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One of our main goals is to create a rule-breaking re-telling of Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet </i>that provides women actors the opportunity to portray dynamic, challenging characters in a contemporary text. The play speaks to current topics of disrupting gender roles, the psychological toll of ongoing war, and the catastrophic consequences of greed and revenge. Our riff on Shakespeare’s Hamlet includes more than just re-gendering the roles: it involves inventing a world in which it is the norm for women to hold power, to externalize forces of power and to drive the action. As theatre artists, we recognize the immense gift Shakespeare left us with his body of work—the complexity of feeling and thought, the precision of language, the beauty of imagery—we hold this dear to our hearts. And yet, we need a new Hamlet, a female Hamlet. </p>
<p>This play is in part a response to canonical feminist theatre theory—such as that by Sue Ellen Case, who asks us to “read against the text” when analyzing the lack of representation of women in classical Greek theatre and Shakespeare. If we as female theatre practitioners find our reflections lacking in these classical works, then in response to Case, indeed to our fellow theatre-makers, is <i>how do we act against the text?</i> How do we create opportunities for women and men that ring truer to the ideals of equality we’d like to experience in and outside the theatre – both for other theatre-makers and the audience? First, we do that by changing the conceptual narrative.  </p>

RKP has been devising the Tragedy of Maria Macabre 
since January 2010 upon
receiving an Emerging Artists rehearsal space grant from the Field in 
association with the Tides Foundation. RKP has
continued the development of this piece further after the end of the

Ward in association with Armory Art Week.

In the summer of 2010, Rachel
Klein and filmmaker Sean Gill made the (then) existing excerpts of The 
Tragedy of
Maria Macabre into a 22-minute short film. 

On March 2nd, 2011, The Tragedy of Maria Macabre performed its first full length presentation at Dixon Place in NYC to a sold out audience and tremendous acclaim. Macabre then delivered two full length encore performances at the Access Theater in Tribeca, and further excerpts were presented at the House of Yes in their circus variety show, the Lower Manhattan Arts League's Spring Downtown Gala (in association with SoHo Rep and HERE Arts Center) and most recently at the Lower East Side Arts Festival at Theater for the New City.

As the four yes-men weigh the pros and cons (and interview a couple of mensches along the way), A Modest Suggestion brings up some pretty tough questions: why do racism and anti-Semitism exist? what does it mean to be Jewish? how does racism turn into violence? and do Jews eat bacon?
Apple Core Theater Company is thrilled to produce this daring, new satire by Israeli-American playwright, Ken Kaissar, at the Studio
Theatre at Theatre Row in midtown Manhattan, May 10-27, 2012. In producing this unique work,
we seek to inspire an honest, thought-provoking discussion around these complicated,
often forgotten topics. Oh, and to make you laugh.


Our Schtick

Apple Core Theater Company produces emotional, entertaining plays by American writers.  Valuing the immediacy and intimacy of theater, we strive to present plays that cut down to the core and go straight to the heart.  Believing that theater should be accessible to all people, we are committed to providing affordable theater to New York City. For more information on our schtick, visit us at 
www.applecoretheatercompany.org.


The Spiel 
If we wanna shlep this play to Theatre Row, we're gonna need some cash -- in fact, we're gonna need about $3,000. Oy! And that, my bubbala, is where you can make all the difference.


** You think the set is going to build itself? Your donation will help pay for everything that goes on the stage, from the office chairs and neck ties to the blindfolds and jars of herring.
** We don't want our actors, designers, and production team to feel like they're chopped liver. Your gift will allow us to -- get this -- pay our actors and production team! (Not much, but better than bupkis.)
** As affordability and accessibility are primary components of our mission, your support will also keep our ticket price at a remarkable $15. You can't beat that in NYC.
** And of course, you'll make a lot of working theater artists who are passionate about this project very, very happy.

Can't contribute now?  You can still help make A Modest Suggestion possible: 

** Help us fundraise by sharing this link with your family and friends! Feel free to consider Facebook, Twitter, email, smoke signals and semaphore.
** Are you a baker? A business owner? Can you provide us with donuts or office chairs (or many other items) through an in-kind sponsorship? Contact allison@applecoretheatercompany.org for more information.
** We always need friends to get the word out about the shows. Tell them to like us on Facebook (and in real life), to follow us on Twitter, to read our blog, and to sign up for our mailing list at www.applecoretheatercompany.org.
** Or maybe you want to see the show? Well, we want to see you too. Remember: tickets are only $15. At the beginning of April, you can find us on www.telecharge.com.

Thank you -- really, thank you for all your support. And when May comes around, don't be a stranger, eh? We'll see you at Theatre Row, May 10-27.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am producing this play as part of my master's thesis in Central and Eastern European Studies <a href=""http://www.lasalle.edu/grad/index.php?section=european_studies&amp;page=index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""CEES page"">(CEES)</a> at La Salle University.  In doing so I educate others while educating myself about modern Ukrainian history and literature.  This play will promote a greater understanding of Ukrainian culture and will spark an interest in Ukrainian literature, which is relatively unknown in America.</p>
<p>Oleksandr Irvanets, the playwright, has not yet had any plays produced in the United States.  He is well known in Ukraine as part of a group in the late 80's and early 90's called Bu-Ba-Bu.  This group wrote and performed poertry in a carnival fasion, incorporating all the arts in their performances.  They had a great impact on the youth of Ukraine before and after Independence in 1991. </p>
<p><br/><em>A Little Play About Betrayal For One Actress</em> is about ONA, a young adult who now lives in a small apartment in a wheelchair.  We learn she was once a student protester.  The world of the play is not specific to constraints of time and place, but through ONA's words we learn more about the fight for Ukrainian Independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and the effects of that independence, including a weak economy and a government run by former Communist leaders. </p>
<p>I think anytime we learn more about someone else's history and culture, we learn about ourselves, and realize that we are all alike and all different.  Sometimes differences in others are visually apparent, but often we forget that  people who look alike are not alike at all.  It is important to remember the very modern history of the impact of the Soviet Union, and not take for granted all the advantages we currently have in America. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This project costs $4000.  This amount covers the rental fee of the Walnut Street Theatre, the pay for the designers, director, and actress, and the cost of building the set and securing the props.  I also have received many donated services.  If I raise the entire cost of producing, I would like to provide the playwright and translators a modest honorarium, even though they have given me permission to perform this play for no charge.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a free cultural and educational program, I am also providing jobs to Philadelphia artists. </p>
<p><br/>The $2000 I am trying to raise on Indiegogo is half the cost--it covers the space, the set, and the props.</p>
<p>Your support is greatly appreciated.  In exchange for various levels of support, we can add your name to our website and to our program.  We can reserve you  a seat, sign a poster, frame a poster, and invite you to the after party.  Please consider being a part of the US Premiere of this production.</p>

<p>Hi there! We are ImprovCity, a clean improvisational comedy troupe based out of Orange County, CA. We began in March 2009 and in just five short years we’ve been named “The Best Place to Laugh in Orange County” three years in a row by the OC Hotlist, “The Best Comedy/Improv in Southern California” by The LA Times, and “The Best Improv Show in Orange County” by CBS Los Angeles. We did all that and started an after school improv arts program at five local high schools, one middle school and two elementary schools.</p>
<p>

Hi there! We are ImprovCity, a clean improvisational comedy troupe based out of Orange County, CA. We began in March 2009 and in just five short years we’ve been named “The Best Place to Laugh in Orange County” three years in a row by the OC Hotlist, “The Best Comedy/Improv in Southern California” by The LA Times, and “The Best Improv Show in Orange County” by CBS Los Angeles. We did all that and started an after school improv arts program at five local high schools, one middle school and two elementary schools.

For the past five years we’ve moved from rented space to rented space - garages, lofts, galleries, conference centers, etc. - and it’s time we try to get our own theater space. We want to build a place that not only offers somewhere to bring the entire family for a night of great live entertainment, but also a place that offers classes, workshops and education in the areas of acting, comedy, improvisation and more to people of all ages.And that's not all we'd use the theater for. We'll also put on musical and play productions, bring in musical guests, have guest speakers on various topics with question and answer forums, have open mic nights for standup comedy and poetry readings, hold movie nights...anything and everything that has to do with the arts and entertainment.What We Need & What You Get

You can be a part of this!</p><p><strong>FATE HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR</strong></p><p>The play takes place over 24 hours in New York City. It starts at a costume party on April Fools Day- where Fate, in human form, crashes the party. She brings with her a decorative axe. What follows is a hilarious, often harrowing examination of the question: can we change our fate, or are we meant to end up where we end up? And if we could change things- should we?</p><p> First off, here's who we are:</p><ul>

It quickly evolved into a strange, exciting, unique piece of theatre that could be called magic realism.

And now, it's time for it's world premiere at FringeNYC!                                                 </p><h3>What We Need </h3><p>We need to raise funds to cover the costs of putting up a show in NYC- which can be pretty expensive, as you can imagine. Here's a list of where you contribution will go:</p><ul>
<li>Rehearsal space- four weeks rehearsal in New York City</li>
<li>scenery for the production-  a pinball machine, a rolling bar, and a very ugly chair</li>
<li>costumes, make-up, hair</li>
<li>Insurance covering auditions, rehearsals, and performances</li>
<li>registration fees</li>
<li>paying our cast and crew- they don't get a lot, but they certainly deserve it!</li>
<li>advertising-  graphic design, photos, email blasts, ad space. REMEMBER, the more funds we raise, the better we can advertise the show!</li>
<li>All funds raised will go towards April's Fool- so if we raise twenty thousand bucks, we place the full page ad in the NY Times.</li>

You can be a part of this!FATE HAS A SENSE OF HUMORThe play takes place over 24 hours in New York City. It starts at a costume party on April Fools Day- where Fate, in human form, crashes the party. She brings with her a decorative axe. What follows is a hilarious, often harrowing examination of the question: can we change our fate, or are we meant to end up where we end up? And if we could change things- should we? First off, here's who we are:

Kelly McAllister is an award winning playwright whose work has been published and produced from NYC to Prague to São Paulo. His plays include: Last Call (winner of Excellence in Playwriting FringeNYC 2002); Burning the Old Man (NYIT 2005 Outstanding Full Length Play); & Hela and Troy (Finalist Humana Festival Heideman award 2010). His plays have been published by Applause Books, Playscripts Inc., Smith & Kruas, and NYTE.

Bronwen Carson is an accomplished director/choreographer based in NYC. Her credits include:  Viva America- B'dway Workshop, The Cherry Orchard - Off-B’dway, In The Key
of Cy - Off B'dwy, Myopia - Neighborhood Playhouse, Dim Sum - The
Neighborhood Playhouse, Sunday in the Park With Phil- Piney Fork Festival,
NYC, Fugue- The Neighborhood Playhouse, the world premiere of “Jack’s Back”  - Gloria Maddox Theatre NYC , 49th Street and Other Stories, Playing With Fire  - The Private
Theatre, The Dragon Play -Articulate Theatre Company, NYC, Two Days til Dawn - Off
B'dwy, and A Tribute to Michael Jackson- 2010 Astaire Awards. 







Craig Nobbs is an award winning playwright, screenwriter and producer. He was recently Associate Producer and Production Manager on the feature film SAM, directed by Nicholas Brooks and is currently producing the short film The Cat's Cradle, written by Tawny Sorenson and directed by David Spaltro,  His plays include A New York Hamlet and Other Stories (adaptations of Chekhov short stories), In the Shadows (commissioned adaptation of Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths), $175/hr, Coffee, Morning is Broken and many other plays that have had readings and productions in New York City.  He is a graduate of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts' Dramatic Writing Program and New York Foundation for the Arts' Artist as Entrepreneur Program.  
The cast:
Sarah Wharton (April)
Ian Campbell Dunn (Ahab)
Liz Conway (Moira)
Daniel Keith (Jaypes)
Heather McAllister (The Norn)
We also have a lovely group of understudies / interns: Laura Jervidalo Ravn (Norn understudy), Laura Epperson (Moira understudy), Johanna Block (April understudy) and Bill Reilly (Jaypes understudy).Where we've beenThe play was originally written as part of Rough Writers, a writing contest at the Fine Arts Center of Colorado Springs. It quickly evolved into a strange, exciting, unique piece of theatre that could be called magic realism. This past April, it was given a staged reading as part of the Playwrights Festival at The Western Stage in Salinas, CA. And now, it's time for it's world premiere at FringeNYC!                                                 What We Need We need to raise funds to cover the costs of putting up a show in NYC- which can be pretty expensive, as you can imagine. Here's a list of where you contribution will go:
Rehearsal space- four weeks rehearsal in New York City
scenery for the production-  a pinball machine, a rolling bar, and a very ugly chair
costumes, make-up, hair
Insurance covering auditions, rehearsals, and performances
registration fees
paying our cast and crew- they don't get a lot, but they certainly deserve it!
advertising-  graphic design, photos, email blasts, ad space. REMEMBER, the more funds we raise, the better we can advertise the show!
All funds raised will go towards April's Fool- so if we raise twenty thousand bucks, we place the full page ad in the NY Times.
What You GetWe have lots of cool perks to offer- everything from a thanks in the shows program to 25 plays for your digital library courtesy of Indie Theater Now to having your fortune read to hanging out with the cast and crew on opening night!Your ImpactJust by reading this far, you are helping!

presenters.</p>
We have the chance to leverage future
performances and tours throughout Asia, which would be a dream come true.  To make it happen, we
need your help to get there! 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The longer story:<br/>
</h3>The offer to perform at SIDance came late and on the condition that we get ourselves there. The festival is offering us a modest
fee ($1,500) and hotel accommodations for 6 nights. We have also secured an emergency grant from American Dance Abroad for $2,000. We have a solid start to raising what we need to get ourselves and our set to Seoul, but we have $5,000 to go and we're turning to you now for help.<p></p>
<p>There are six of us traveling- 3
dancers, 2 musicians, 1 set designer/ lighting technician. If we raise this $5,000 we will have enough to cover our airfare, set transport, with a little bit left over to pay our hardworking team, who are otherwise working for peanuts, or rather, kimchee. <br/></p>
<p>Your contribution would be not only helping us get to this gig in Korea, it would be helping pave the road for future inkBoat performances in Asia. It would be a gift toward a very specific purpose as well as an investment in our future. <br/></p>
<h3>The even longer story:</h3>
<p>One of the many reasons we are excited about this opportunity to perform <i>Line Between </i>at SIDance is that we seldom have the chance to revisit any of our past works. Typically, artists are funded to make new work rather than to develop old material. We are thrilled to get the chance to return to past material and develop it further. A human being goes through a lot of changes in four years, as Niko so boldly illustrates. How have we grown as artists, and how will this production of <i>Line Between </i>reflect our growth? <br/></p>
<p>Back in 2011, <i>Line Between </i>was made through the collaborative efforts of Shinichi Iova-Koga, Dohee Lee and Peiling Kao as performers, Suki O'Kane and Jason Ditzian as musicians, and Dana Iova-Koga as director.  The design team (which won an ""Izzie"" award for outstanding stage design) included Amy Rathbone (set and instillations), Frank Lee (set), Allen Willner (lighting and stage), and Alice Wu (costumes). 
</p>
<p>We are faced with some challenges in this endeavor. The first has to do with embracing change. The irreplaceable Dohee Lee and Jason Ditzian are unable to join us for this performance. However, we are thrilled to have on board with us Jubilith Moore (performer) and Katherine
 McDonald (musician), two wonderful artists who bring their unique 
talents to the work. Peiling's role will be played by Dana (who wanted to do it back in 2011, but couldn't due to being extremely pregnant.) <br/></p>
<p>The second big challenge has to do with funding. Which is, of course, why we are doing this darn crowdfunding thing. As we have discovered, there are very few grants out there that will fund international touring performances. And even if there were, this invitation came too late to give us ample fundraising time. <br/></p>
<p>We were fully aware of these challenges when we said yes. But it is a yes we feel very excited about proclaiming.</p>

<p>Even if you can't or don't want to contribute to this campaign, will you say ""YES!"" out loud on our behalf?

<p>Originally from upstate New York, I trained at The Draper Center for Dance Education, then continued on to graduate from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 2008.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have been fortunate to work with artists such as Adam Barruch, Margie Gillis, Sidra Bell, and Steven Petronio.  I was able to create site specific art films with mishmash* in Japan and Sarah Elgart (arrogantelbow) in New York, and spent almost four years with London-based immersive theatre company Punchdrunk in their production 'Sleep No More.' These amazing opportunities have challenged and expanded my physical and performative worlds, and it is because of these experiences that I am extremely excited to share with you the next and newest adventure : my first ever solo show. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After learning, working and growing in the New York art scene for the last 11 years, I began to notice shifts in my perception. My idea of success (and what it looks like) has changed, as has my idea of what I need versus what I want. So, when a dear friend suggested I present a solo show, the idea marinated for almost a year and a half, until I realized: one, I CAN and WANT to do this, and two, this IS the RIGHT time. Deciding to present this solo show feels like a continued evolution of myself as human and artist. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once I made up my mind I knew it would be no small task: trying something fresh, learning something new, the possibility of failure overwhelmed by the determination to succeed.  Understanding that ideas are best when vetted, I created a board of artistic advisors - people who inspire, challenge and support me - to guide me along the way. I am honored to have legends: <a href=""http://www.margiegillis.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Margie Gillis</a> and <a href=""http://solomons-says.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gus Solomons Jr.</a> act as mentors on the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The show will be a evening of 4 solos presented as part of Gina Gibney's POP Series at the Agnes Varies theatre in downtown Manhattan next June 29th, 30th and July 1st.  I am honored to announce I will be creating work in collaboration with the brilliant artists : <a href=""http://www.palissimo.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pavel Zustiak</a> ,<a href=""http://www.pigeonwingdance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Gabrielle Lamb</a>, <a href=""http://anatomiaeoccultii.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adam Barruch</a> and a piece of my own. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I am seeking is your support of reaching an initial fundraising goal of: $10,000. This will be divided among rehearsal space and time, the artists time and collaboration, costumes, lighting, PR materials, theatre staff, and theatre rental. I am committed to honoring each artists’ time and dedication to this project by compensating them, for which I am asking your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I so deeply appreciate your support, and couldn’t do this without you.  Boundless thanks - for you I am infinitely grateful.  </p>

</h3>
<p>For 30 years <a href=""http://www.borderlandstheater.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Borderlands Theater</a> has produced award-winning theatre reflecting the diverse voices of the US-Mexico border region.  We want to make our latest and most ambitious project, <a href=""http://www.barriostories.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BARRIO STORIES</a>, accessible to 1000 Tucson Unified School District (TUSD) students and anyone else without the means to experience this innovative, oral history, theatrical spectacle.  <br/></p>
<p><b>About Barrio Stories</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Staged outdoors on the grounds of the Tucson Convention Center, BARRIO STORIES brings to life the oral histories of Tucson’s 
original Mexican American neighborhood demolished with the building of 
the convention center in the 1960s. Precious memories come to life as 
audience members take a theatrical tour of what used to be the bustling 
epicenter of commerce and public celebrations for Tucson’s 
Mexican-American community.  Find out more about this important history at <a href=""http://www.barriostories.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.barriostories.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">barriostories.org.</a><br/></p>
<p>BARRIO STORIES is a large-scale (the size of two football fields), site-specific, fully immersive theatrical event involving: <b><i>40 principle actors, 75 extras, 10 youth mariachi and baile folklorico ensembles, 4 giant puppets, over 100 volunteers, and dozens of technicians, designers, and staff</i></b>.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>You Get What You Give:<br/>
</h3>We need $7,500 to underwrite the cost of tickets for 1000 TUSD high school and middle school students and anyone else who may not have the means to purchase a ticket to this history making (and history preserving) event.  Your donations will cover costs such as: <br/><ul>
<li><b>Hiring extra staff for eight weeks to produce this event</b></li>
<li><b>Offsetting substantial equipment and venue costs for a project of such large scale. <br/>
</b></li>
<li>
<b>Administrative overhead to produce this event  (office rent, utilities, insurance, overnight security, web designers, graphic design, printing, etc.) </b><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a theatre company, tickets sales are our life blood. They pay our staff salaries, and all the administrative costs that grants (often restricted to artist fees, and direct project expenses) do not.  BARRIO STORIES will be a completely donation based event. Though some patrons will donate at the door, we know there will be many who cannot pay.  AND WE WANT THEM TO COME!!  TUSD has generously donated all the buses needed to bring 1000 students. We are hoping the COMMUNITY can underwrite these tickets sales so necessary to the basic operation of the company. <br/></p>

For the scores of audiences hearing these narratives for the first time, BARRIO STORIES will help them understand the city we call home.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Join us! It’s your patronage that makes this production possible. Dance is an ephemeral art form and we ask that you unite with us to express the intrinsic value that comes when people share the beauty of a live performance. With extreme dedication, passion, and commitment, we work without the expectation of a monetary gain and we embrace all the challenges that go along with staging live performances. We do this to bring a unique and powerful experience to our audience and to make our world a better place by connecting people through the creative experience.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>By undertaking such a large scale production in an alternative space, we have some special challenges. We will need to load in lights, sound systems, and set up chairs for the audience. All of these things are additional expenses but are also of the utmost importance to the professional level of the production. With the many new collaborations in music, set design, and digital media we will need extra support this year. There are always surprises along the way but with such a seasoned and experienced group of artists and administrators, we can easily overcome any obstacles. Let’s establish a strong arts community - right here and right now! As an individual donor, you can take a stand and make the arts a meaningful and important part of our world!</p>

 give you not one, but TWELVE plays, all smushed together. They're full of 
songs, dances, monologues, parodies, vaudeville, experimental pieces, a
lot of yelling, and—I promise—not very much politics.  So, what exactly are we trying to get away with here?

This is the second show I've written to be produced in New York. The first was Nothing's Going To Happen, last spring at the Gene Frankel Theatre. Getting Away With It is even more of a passion project, in some ways. I started writing the earliest of these plays in 2005, a third of my life has gone into this show. But it took the brilliance & dedication of this cast & crew to bring it to the stage, led by Christina Balkovic.From the Director:

<h3>About the Production</h3>
<div>
<em>You Should Have Stayed Home</em> is a play about Tommy Taylor's experience over 48 hours at the 2010 G20 weekend in Toronto. While trying to return home from his first ever protest as a law-abiding citizen at the ""Free Speech Zone"" at Queen's Park, Taylor was swept up in a mass arrest, caged with 40 other people in a ten foot by twenty foot cage and denied drinking water until he passed out from dehydration.<br/><br/>The play is an adaptation of Tommy’s Facebook note,  <em>How I Got Arrested and Abused at G20 in Toronto</em>. The note went viral and has been translated into seven languages and appeared in twenty-one countries – a detailed, frightening and often funny account of the largest mass arrest in Canadian history. Tommy’s story has been covered by national and international media, including a Gemini-nominated CBC documentary named after the production. <br/><br/>After winning the largest cash award at the 2011 SummerWorks Festival, and becoming one of the festival’s highest grossing shows, Praxis Theatre, in association with The Original Norwegian, is about to embark on its largest project ever: a cross-Canada tour to Whitehorse, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, and Ottawa.<br/><br/><em>You Should Have Stayed Home</em> is a one-man piece of storytelling in the tradition of Spalding Gray, with Taylor moving around a replica Eastern Avenue Detention Centre cage as he recounts 48 hours in his life as a citizen on the streets and eventually incarcerated. Part-way through the narrative, there is a scene that incorporates twenty-six participants that can be played by actors and non-actors when the action arrives at a cell in the Eastern Avenue Detention Centre.<br/><br/>Taking advantage of new possibilities available through social media, volunteer detainees were crowd-sourced on the internet for the 2011 SummerWorks production. As the show tours cities across Canada, the company will continue to use online tools to work with community members in each city as Tommy’s fellow detainees. Praxis is proud to be working with the support of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, Council of Canadians and the Toronto office of Amnesty International, who will be putting calls out for volunteers in each of our cities.</div>

<p>We're Easy Leap Theatre Company, and we want your help to realize our first production, William Shakespeare's <em>Love's Labors Lost</em>, which will be taking place this October at the Access Theater in New York City. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Whether or not we meet our goal, we're committed to making this show happen. But that said, there are a few things we could use a little help with. We're hoping to raise $3500, which will break down as following: </p>
<p>$1675 to rent the Gallery at the Access Theater. </p>
<p>$1115 for insurance. </p>
<p>$710 for costumes, props, posters, and other minor expenses. </p>
<p>Any money we raise above our goal will go to this latter category, allowing us to purchase even fancier props and costumes. Think giant, furry Russian hats. </p>
<p>We have some fun incentives to offer in return for your help!</p>
<p>$10-- Two tickets to the performance of your choice! This is half-off the price at the door in October, so if you're going to come anyway, why not grab a pair in advance? </p>
<p>$25-- Two tickets to the show, plus a signed poster from the cast and crew. </p>
<p>$35-- Two tickets, a poster, and a mix CD of the music from the show. Music has been an essential aspect of the storytelling from the start of this idea, so we're very excited to share what we've come up with you! </p>
<p>$50-- Two tickets, a poster, a mix CD, and the character of your choice will record a video serenade of their favorite love poem or song. </p>
<p>$75-- Two tickets, a poster, a mix CD, a personalized serenade, and a copy of the script, specially annotated with all of the stupid jokes and comments that come up in rehearsal, as well as slightly more serious commentary about the text and our interpretation of it from the director and dramaturg. </p>
<p>$100-- Four tickets, a poster, a mix CD, a personalized serenade, an annotated script, and baked goods of your choice, made by a cast member and hand-delivered to you at the performance. </p>
<p>$200-- Four tickets, a poster, a mix CD, a personalized serenade, an annotated script, baked goods, and a DVD of the show, to be delivered after performances are completed! </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Why This Show? </h3>
<p>According to the Victorians and others in the centuries since Shakespeare’s death, <em>Love’s Labors Lost</em>… kind of sucks. But today, the odd ending feels surprisingly contemporary, and the world it shows looks a lot like our own: where the hazy space between the end of education and the beginning of adult responsibility seems like it might last forever, when you’re only beginning to realize that who you are and who you’re supposed to be might be very different, and all the other deep thoughts that arise when your smartest friends come over for the most eloquent house party in history.  </p>
<p>Performed by a company of women, this courtly tale of courtship becomes not only a battle between the sexes, but an investigation of the who and the how and the why of finding oneself somewhere in the modern sea of social expectation, and when you have a group of friends who are sure that rhyme is more important than reason. </p>
<p></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't give now, we hope you'll join us at the show in October! And as with any social media-based campaign, the absolute best way to help out is to spread the word! </p>

</p><p><b>Get Kayleigh to Verve</b></p>
<p><b>Hello
everybody!</b></p>
<p>My name
is Kayleigh Price, I am 22 years old and am a Contemporary Dancer. I recently
graduated from the Northern School of Contemporary dance, <b>NSCD! Woop Woop!</b>
The training consisted of vigorous hours that made me work at my dance practice
which led me to gain a 1st in BPA Honors Contemporary Dance degree. </p>
<p>I
auditioned for a company called Verve, which is a postgraduate company that
allows recent graduates to further their studies as well as take a big step
into the professional industry. With Verve, I am fortunate enough to be
guaranteed a place as a dancer. Being a dancer verve allows me to work with 4
amazing choreographers in which I get to learn a lot of new skills and become a
better performer taking a big step into the professional world. I get to tour
around the world to beautiful European countries I have never imagined going to
as a dancer, performing in such countries as<b> Italy and Holland!!!!!!!!! :D :D
:D :D :D :D :D</b></p>
<p>But in
order for me to take this fantastic opportunity I need to raise £3,760 for the
tuition fee. This is a large amount that unfortunately I can not afford. <b>:(
:( :( :( :( !!!!!!!!</b></p>
<p><b>This is
where you come in!</b></p>
<p>I am
asking for any donation towards the tuition fee as it will help me immensely.
In doing so will get me to further my career and network with renown artists

Hello
everybody!
My name
is Kayleigh Price, I am 22 years old and am a Contemporary Dancer. I recently
graduated from the Northern School of Contemporary dance, NSCD! Woop Woop!
The training consisted of vigorous hours that made me work at my dance practice
which led me to gain a 1st in BPA Honors Contemporary Dance degree. 
I
auditioned for a company called Verve, which is a postgraduate company that
allows recent graduates to further their studies as well as take a big step
into the professional industry. With Verve, I am fortunate enough to be
guaranteed a place as a dancer. Being a dancer verve allows me to work with 4
amazing choreographers in which I get to learn a lot of new skills and become a
better performer taking a big step into the professional world. I get to tour
around the world to beautiful European countries I have never imagined going to
as a dancer, performing in such countries as Italy and Holland!!!!!!!!! :D :D
:D :D :D :D :D
But in
order for me to take this fantastic opportunity I need to raise £3,760 for the
tuition fee. This is a large amount that unfortunately I can not afford. :(
:( :( :( :( !!!!!!!!
This is
where you come in!
I am
asking for any donation towards the tuition fee as it will help me immensely.
In doing so will get me to further my career and network with renown artists
across the globe allowing me to expand my practice. 
What will
you get from me in return for your donation? Prizes!
Different
contributions will allow you to win prizes depending on the quantity of
donation.
£5 - A wave from me. Queen style.

<h3><b>Following my Dream…THEATRE!</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><em><em><em><em>“Our stories come from our lives and from the playwright’s
pen, the mind of the actor, the roles we create, the artistry of life itself
and the quest for peace.” –Maya Angelou</em></em></em></em></p>
<p>My ardent
passion for writing resonated within me from the first moment I picked up a pen
at the age of four, and I’ve never stopped writing since.  I was always intrigued by stories,
particularly colorful tales that illuminated and humanized the lives of African
Americans.  Influenced by the
literary works of Lorraine Hansberry, Maya Angelou, and Langston Hughes, my fascination with the world of theatre blossomed and a career in the arts seemed destined.  Now, as a
playwright, actress, director, and producer, my theatre credits include <i>Storyville Blues, Blood Water, </i>and <i>Indigo. 
</i>My theatre productions have premiered most recently Off-Off-Broadway, New York and to sold-out
audiences in Virginia and Atlanta.  My work 
has also garnered national attention being selected for the Midtown International Theatre
Festival in New York, the D.C. Black Theatre Festival and the Atlanta Black
Theatre Festival.  </p>
<p>My goal is to continue following my dream and writing thought-provoking works that show the world the dynamics and essence of African American culture.  Also, as a producer, I want to continue to open doors for aspiring artists so that they will have an opportunity to showcase their talents and reach their artistic dreams as well.  Through Yellow Dream's National Theatre Tour, we will be able to reach and empower diverse audiences in theaters across the country, and hopefully, make it to Broadway!</p>
<p>So far, it has been a huge challenge juggling a full-time job and trying to pursue my dream career in theatre, so I finally made the
long-awaited decision to follow my dream full-time!  I humbly appreciate all support for this campaign, which will help to bring me one step closer to my dream and with your help, Broadway won't seem so far away after all!</p>

<p><b>Yellow Dream Productions</b></p>
<p>A place where theatre is unconventional and art is a REVOLUTION...</p>
<p>Yellow Dream's mission is to create profound, artistically innovative theatre productions that illuminate the African American cultural experience and inspire a movement towards social change.  </p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I founded Yellow Dream
Productions to provide a place where my dreams could flourish, and I would have
the freedom to create original, ground-breaking theatre productions, open doors for aspiring artists, and bolster efforts to revolutionize the black theatre experience<span>.  Although my works are deeply entrenched in the African American experience they also permeate with universal
themes of freedom, love and identity that educate and speak to diverse audiences.  Fascinated with history, period pieces have
become my staple, and my work has been termed as “culture-binding, strong and
universal.”  </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Blood Water</b></p>
<p><em><em>Blood Water</em></em> is a bold artistic portrayal of the
demoralizing system of slavery and the struggle for freedom. An ancient well on the McCreary Plantation, owned by a mulatto slave owner, holds a daunting mystery that reveals the brutalizing aftermath of slavery and redefines the ideal of freedom<span>.  Blood Water not only captures the darkness of
the slavery era, but it also resonates with rich, colorful and mysterious
characters, which humanize the African American experience in the Deep South.  Ultimately, it  challenges the ideal of freedom and manhood and explores the historical context of slavery from two different angles: the oppressed slave and
the tragic mulatto slave owner.  Thus,
the depth of artistry, level of suspense and dynamic talent in this production
makes <em><em><em><em>Blood Water</em></em></em></em> my most compelling theatrical piece yet. </span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p><b>National Theater Tour</b></p>
<p>There was once a historical myth that “all-Negro”
shows were considered unprofitable because black people did not go to the
theater.<span>  According to Broadway League,
less than 10% of Broadway theatre-goers are African Americans.  However, a big reason for the absence
of black audiences is due to the limited number of African American shows
on Broadway and in national theaters.  As an African American
woman playwright and producer, I hope to shatter this myth and diversify the
national theatre experience by bridging the gap between theatre and black
audiences.  </span></p>

<p>Essentially, there is a lot of history, education and enlightenment that people of all ages and backgrounds can attain from the theatre and black audiences should not be isolated from that experience.  Thus, Yellow Dream Productions plans to jumpstart a three-state tour for 2015, which will provide an opportunity for diverse audiences from small, rural and large states to experience our quality, entertaining and cost-effective theatre productions.  Hopefully, this will attract more black theatre goers and encourage more African American artists, playwrights, directors and producers to help promote and sustain the integrity of black theatre.  Essentially, the national theater tour will provide us with the recognition, financial help and support we need to continue our artistic mission and change the social and economic climate of theatre.</p> <p><br/></p>
</div> <div> </div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div><strong> </strong></div><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>The challenge in producing any theatre production is
establishing an effective marketing campaign that will attract target audiences

you always face the risk of losing money if the ticket sales are not good.  The primary goal for this campaign is to
raise enough money to help jumpstart a national tour with a creative marketing campaign that will
appeal to first-time and loyal theatre patrons so that we stand a great chance
of packing the house! The reward is that we will be able to reach diverse

Theater is a medium uniquely suited to convey a message in the most direct and intimate manner possible - and through Broken Dolls we aim to bring about a much needed shift in understanding of the enormity of the problem and the devastating consequences of not actively taking a position on it.We have been offered the opportunity to bring Broken Dolls to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland this year, to be preceded by an Off-Broadway preview at 59E59 Theaters in New York City. After presenting the play in Edinburgh, we plan to bring its message back to the states, with the view of taking it on the road and making the context of the play relevant to the complex realities of the sex-trafficking industry in a country as demographically diverse and economically well-off as the US. Fiscally our aim is to donate 33% of the box-office proceeds to NGOs and Non-Profits who are actively engaged in the rescue and rehabilitation of victims.Why we need youTo achieve our goal we need your help. Putting on a show of this scale is an expensive enterprise. We have been fortunate to find funds to cover some of our initial costs, like deposits for the theater space in Edinburgh and flights. We have assembled a wonderful cast and a minimal and very dedicated crew. We are off to a great start, but without your help our success is in question. We urge you to take a stand against sex-trafficking and help us spread the message. No donation is too small and your donations are tax deductible. If you are not in a position to donate but still want to contribute to this cause - please spread the word about our campaign.Thank you. Meet The TeamIlona Saic (actress)NARCISA - A young Moldovan victim of sex-trafficking. Thrilled to be making her off-Broadway debut in Broken Dolls, Ilona recently graduated from The William Esper Studio in Manhattan, New York.

<p><b>Our Project</b></p>
<p>A Brief Look at the After Glow is a play
that has been in development for three and a half years. It began as a writing
exercise for Resident Playwright Robert Francis and eventually became a one act
production through Cold Basement Dramatics. For the past two years through
table readings and numerous drafts, it has been developed into a full length
two act production. It is the directorial debut of company member Stephen
Bisinger and boasts an ensemble cast of nine actors. The play is slated to
perform in late August and early September at the Heartland Studio in the
Roger’s Park neighborhood of Chicago, Il. </p>
<p>The play itself is a raw and gritty tale
of a young woman traveling through a post-Rapture landscape in an attempt to
find her father. At the edge of the world sits his cabin. Inside the cabin are
other survivors who know the truth about what happened to the young woman’s
father. As she tries to learn their secrets, the end of existence seems to inch
closer and closer towards them.</p>
<p>This will be the debut production of The
Foundling’s Theatre Company’s second season.</p>
<p><b>Who
We Are</b></p>
<p>The Foundling’s are a group of young
theater artists looking to find their own home in the Chicago Theater Scene.
Most of our work is about being separated from family. Since most of our
company members are not originally from Chicago, it is a topic we all feel very
deeply.</p>
<p>The company was founded in November of
2012 by then recent graduates D.J. Douglass, Robert Francis and Matthew Pratt.</p>
<p>Our current company consists of: David
Servillo (Artistic Director), D.J. Douglass (Managing Director), Rachel Himmel,

<p><b>Why
We Need Your Support</b></p>
<p>As a small, emerging theater company, we
need help from patrons like you in order to give our productions the level of quality
we know we can achieve. Your donations will go towards costumes, make-up,
props, set, and lighting. Every penny will be used to create a world within the
space that is as real and terrifying as the Apocalypse can be. You would be a
tremendous help to us and to the show we are producing.</p>

These are just some of the comments received about this work.  It is a play based on the playwright's family history, my family history!  You now have a never before opportunity to do several once in a lifetime things regarding this work.

2.  Help it get the exposure it needs.

3.  Help one of the few surviving community theatres in the country continue to survive by bringing this work to it.

4.  Help honor the Theatre's Artistic Director who finds this work worthy and should be recognized for bringing such non commercial and conceivably sensitive and controversial subject matters to the fore.

5.  Help make a difference in race relations in the south where it has historically needed it the most.

6.  Help bridge racial divides by bringing a play to light which promotes understanding and acceptance regarding differences and sensabilities.

7.  Help remind people that family composition is what you make it, not necessarily what you are born into.  We are best a product of the love we share, not the hatred or lack of love of which we may be victims.

8.  Help promote an international cast all of which all are little known but very much deserving of your support.  Most importantly come out and allow yourself to be captivated by their passion and their skill.

9.  Honor the commitment of this dedicated team, one that is truly like a family, all of which have been repeatedly underpaid.

9.  Help support a talented Director and talented crew.

10.  Help support talented and worthy musicians with unique and interesting skills and capabilities.

11.  Come and enjoy the splendor of the exclusive little City in Louisiana that boasts one of the most scenic and serene coasts in the south, grass lined with hundred year old Oak Trees and fronted by old and newly restored antebellum homes.  

12.  Support the Gulf Coast which is still undergoing it's fight to revitalize since being hit with multiple natural and unnatural disasters.

13.  While on your trip to see this show and support everything associated with it, see and support New Orleans, only 30 miles from the area where the play is set and will be brought home.  

14.  See the parts of New Orleans that were damaged the most by Hurricane Katrina, some of which are still struggling to rebuild and maybe never can.  See the classic areas that were not damaged and continue to thrive and charm jazz and creole and cajun food lovers from around the world.

15.  Gain the pride of knowing you helped give light to a show that is CREATIVE and POWERFUL and and EDUCATIONAL and ENTERTAINING and TRUTH BASED and INSPIRING and ORIGINAL!... qualities that are truly rare among a sea theatrical replicas that exist throughout the world.

1242 pacific productions is raising money for a June 2012 production of the wall: a story of the land, written and directed by Noelle Ghoussaini. The performances will take place in various locations in Brooklyn. There will be live music, shadow puppetry and of course – an epic story! 
The Impact
Raising funds for this project will enable us to bring political, evocative theatre to non-traditional spaces, such as a community garden and old public baths at a low-cost and for free. We will also have a special performance just for high school playwriting and theatre students. 
What the wall is about:
the wall is an allegorical, science-fiction performance piece that explores a projected future society, depleted of the earth’s resources. In this society, the dominant community, living in the Vast Lands, live off of their oppressed neighbors by confining them within Honeycomb Reserves (walled-off communities) and using their energy to sustain their more luxurious lifestyle. The piece explores the perspectives of inhabitants on both side of the wall and the external and internal barriers each of them face in relation to the imposing structure that separates their communities.
The History
the wall was inspired by exploring the personal and political motivations of barriers and boundaries that have been created throughout history. Then, asking the question: what are the roots and effects of internal and external barriers?
An excerpt of the piece was performed in June of 2011 at La Mama Theatre and in December of 2011 at a site-specific location in Brooklyn, NY. Most recently, the the play received a staged reading at Judson Memorial Church's MagicTime series in February of 2012.

<br/><p style=""text-align: left;"">
<em>All in the Shuffle</em> is an intensely moving, naturalistic drama about a deeply wounded family struggling to heal.  Set in 1978, Frank, suffering from Parkinsons, grieving the loss of his wife, and estranged from his daughter Vivian, struggles to find a reason to go on.  His granddaughter Angie, torn between her own dreams and caring for her ailing grandfather, tries to mend the deep rift between Frank and Vivian, as Vivian searches for a new lease on life.  Be sure to click on the video link above to meet the actors and hear excerpts from the script.</p>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<br/><p style=""text-align: left;"">
										An opera singer in a previous life, Natalie stepped off the stage and behind the pen a year a half ago when she discovered a new talent and a new love in playwriting. Back in January, having so far written the book for a children's cabaret show and a dozen or so short plays, she decided it was time to attempt her first full-length play.  Inspired by the movie <em>Julie and Julia</em>, she decided to give herself 9 months to complete it and to <a href=""http://www.birthofaplaywright.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> about the process.<span style="""">  </span>Why 9 months? When creating a work of art, that art feels like your ""baby"" (and is as close as Natalie ever plans to get to giving birth to something).<span style="""">  She</span> ""conceived"" on January 15th, making her ""due date"" October 8th.</p>

Her registry of desired gift levels is listed below (under “how the funds will be used”). However you can help out is most appreciated!



About the play


All in the Shuffle is an intensely moving, naturalistic drama about a deeply wounded family struggling to heal.  Set in 1978, Frank, suffering from Parkinsons, grieving the loss of his wife, and estranged from his daughter Vivian, struggles to find a reason to go on.  His granddaughter Angie, torn between her own dreams and caring for her ailing grandfather, tries to mend the deep rift between Frank and Vivian, as Vivian searches for a new lease on life.  Be sure to click on the video link above to meet the actors and hear excerpts from the script.



About the project


										An opera singer in a previous life, Natalie stepped off the stage and behind the pen a year a half ago when she discovered a new talent and a new love in playwriting. Back in January, having so far written the book for a children's cabaret show and a dozen or so short plays, she decided it was time to attempt her first full-length play.  Inspired by the movie Julie and Julia, she decided to give herself 9 months to complete it and to blog about the process.  Why 9 months? When creating a work of art, that art feels like your ""baby"" (and is as close as Natalie ever plans to get to giving birth to something).  She ""conceived"" on January 15th, making her ""due date"" October 8th.


Why contribute?

											Because the world needs more great theater!  Theater to bring us together, to touch and move us, to make us look at ourselves and the human condition in a new way.  Just as it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community to put on a play.   Lacking a patron, a government grant or a personal fortune, Natalie can’t bring this little play into the world all on her own.  Whether this play sits on a shelf, only to be heard or read by a handful of people, or gets brought to life so it can be shared and enjoyed by many, is up to you.  Give whatever you can, whatever feels good.  Come be a nanny, a big brother, and aunt, or a stork to this little play, and help bring a creation into the world that didn’t exist before.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

THE BOOBY PRIZE is an 'UPLIFTING' comedy celebrating the boob-a-liciousness in all of us!</p>

<p>Written/Performed by Lizzie Czerner</p>
<p>Directed by Jeffrey Wylie<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To look at writer/performer, Lizzie Czerner, one might say that she is ""blessed"", but Lizzie never considered having large breasts much of a blessing.  She was teased as an adolescent, and as an adult, she received the sort of male attention that is usually reserved for blow-up dolls and other specialty store items.  As a result, Lizzie spent most of her life trying to hide her ""blessings"", wearing bulky sweatshirts and anything tent-like that she could find.  But one day in her mid 30's, Lizzie had the sudden realization that by hiding her boobs away from the world, she was also hiding HERSELF.  She knew that life was passing her by, and she was not living it...</p>
<p><br/>THE BOOBY PRIZE is about one woman's decision to come out of hiding and experience life.  The message of the show is that on the journey to find love, one must first find love of SELF.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Lizzie Czerner and Jeffrey Wylie are proud to bring THE BOOBY PRIZE to the stage this summer in Los Angeles, at THE HOLLYWOOD FRINGE FESTIVAL (June 16-26) and in New York City, at THE NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL FRINGE FESTIVAL (Aug. 12-28).  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>The Impact:</p>
<p><br/></p>THE BOOBY PRIZE will donate 25% of online donations, as well as a percentage of ticket sale proceeds, to the KEEP A BREAST FOUNDATION.  (This show is not about breast cancer, but the disease has touched Lizzie's family personally, and the issue of prevention is even closer to her heart than her boobs are!)  <br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p>Who knew festivals were so expensive?!  Lizzie is eternally grateful to Jeffrey Wylie, who is (miraculously) donating his time as her Director, and she hopes you will want to donate too to help keep this project going and bring boobaliciousness to the world! :)  (If you are unable to donate monetarily, we would be equally grateful for donated services, or for those who wish to volunteer time during either the L.A. or N.Y.C. festivals to help make the show a success!)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>*At this point I would like to remind friends &amp; family that I have never had a Bat Mitzvah, wedding, baby shower, or expensive rite of passage of any kind. - So just think of all the money I have saved you over the years!  ;)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here is a break-down of costs for both fests combined:<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Festival registration fees - $850  <br/></p>
<p>Venue fees - $700</p>
<p>Cost for online/print ads in guides and trade magazines - $800</p>
<p>Cost for postcards/flyers/posters/press kits - $600</p>
<p>Cost for street team to hand out marketing materials and talk up the show - $250</p>
<p>Airfare for two to NYC from LA and back -  $1000</p>
<p>Room and board for two in NYC for the month of August -  $1000</p>
<p>Publicist - $1000</p>
<p>Website design and online marketing campaign - $500</p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate""> BURNT UMBER was originally commissioned/workshopped by Crowded Fire Theater Company and Playwrights Foundation (SF). Workshops followed at New Dramatists (NYC), Arena Stage (DC) and most recently with the current cast at Powerhouse/New York Stage and Film (Vassar). Though it takes place in Tulsa in 2007, BURNT UMBER is haunted by the events of the Tulsa Race Riots (1921), Rwandan genocide (1994), and the Bosnian ethnic cleansing campaign and genocide in Srebrenica (1992-1995). The characters somnabulently orbit around this domestic American drama in an atmosphere of neglect, denial, and communication breakdown-elements known to successfully break a family apart, or in a different context, allow a genocidal act to occur.

""The Last Days of Judas Iscariot""
 
We are launching our IndieGoGo campaign to raise additional funding to produce a professional (AEA) six-week engagement of this remarkable play at the Victory Theatre in Los Angeles.

It speaks to the ""cause and effect"" of our actions in this life and deals so honestly with the condition of the human soul.




 What We Need
We are looking to raise a minimum of 10,000 to make this a reality. The funding will be used to pay for the rental space of the theater, all production cost and actors pay



The Impact: Making a Place for Ourselves
By donating to this project you will be supporting a piece of art that has the capacity to start dialogue; to effect change; to touch lives in ways that are often unexpected and intangible.
Your donation will be crucial in helping to bring about a fully-realized, thought provoking piece of theatre that for us, is just the launching pad for more productions to come!
You Can Help!!!
Even if you can't donate right now, you can help us by spreading the word!!  Make some noise about our campaign, post the link on Facebook, use the IndieGoGo share tools...tell all your friends!  Everything counts.  We believe that what we do is truly worth it, and hope you do to.  We are placing our future in your hands, and couldn't be prouder to do so.

<h3>What's the deal?</h3>
<p>Persephone Productions is a Montreal based theatre company. We are engaging donors through Indiegogo to help our upcoming production of SPRING AWAKENING: THE MUSICAL (book and lyrics by Steven Sater, Music by Duncan Sheik - based on the play by Frank Wedekind). All donations over $40 will receive a tax receipt.</p>
<h3>Who is Persephone?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Persephone Productions is a not-for-profit theatre company (and registered charity) mandated to provide experience and exposure to young artists and to foster a collaborative work environment.</span></p>
<p>Founded on the belief that the greatness of any city depends on the state of its cultural events and the health of its artistic community, Persephone Productions seeks to acknowledge the importance of theatre in our lives by creating opportunities for young artists to find their place and make a contribution.</p>
<p>The company is committed to presenting plays that are innovative and of literary merit and social significance.</p>
<h3>Why do we need your help?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Persephone does not currently receive any outside funding aside from donations. </p>
<p>While we are very excited to bring this powerful show to the Montreal stage, it is one of the most expensive and ambitious shows we have ever attempted. </p>
<h3>Why contribute?</h3>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, your support will be two-fold!</p>
<p>Firstly, this musical explores themes that are just as relevant and in need of discussion today as they were when the original play was written in the 19th century. Several of the themes include <span>sexual repression, abortion, homosexuality, school pressures, rape, abuse, and teen suicide. Each one a relevant hot topic in it's own right, the musical weaves together each of these important issues with delicacy and honesty. Aside from being a beautiful story, the show acts as an aid to help further discussions into areas where exposure and understanding are sadly still inadequate.</span></p>
<p>On top of supporting an important piece of work, your contributions will support the future of young artists! Persephone exists solely to give a chance to emerging artists, in a community that is arguably lacking in opportunities.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is the money for?</h3>
<p>By contributing towards the price of the theatre space for our production, you will let us free up our current modest funds to other ares of the production, including: fees for all artists involved, materials for costumes and set, rental of audio equipment, cost of rights to do the show, etc.  </p>
<h3>Will indiegogo cover all costs?</h3>
<p>Not quite! With the projected amount these contributions will amount for less than 20% of our overall cost. That being said, it is a HUGE help!!!</p>
<h3>Can I come see the show?</h3>
<p>Of course you can! We will run from <span>October 17-27 at 3819, rue Calixa-Lavallée. Tickets can be purchased at <a href=""http://www.showticu4.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.showtix4u.com/boxoffice.php?submit=Search+for+Events&amp;begin=1542968&amp;current_client=0835071207021086&amp;ts=1381421387"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.showtix4u.com/boxoffice.php?submit=Search+for+Events&amp;begin=1542968&amp;current_client=0835071207021086&amp;ts=1381421387"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.showtix4u.com</a> or check our website for more details: <a href=""http://www.persephoneproductions.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.persephoneproductions.org</a></span></p>

<p>You can also spread the word about our production and this very campaign!</p>
