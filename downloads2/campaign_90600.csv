<h2>Your Questions Answered!<br/>
</h2>
<h4>How fast can the BuzzBar charge my device?</h4>
<p>The BuzzBar charges your device at up to the USB (2.0) standard. That is fast! Faster than older computers. The BuzzBar itself will output ~ 15Wh or 4400 mAh of energy, which is up to two to three full charges of an average smartphone. <br/></p>
<h4>How long does the BuzzBar take to fully charge via BuzzSol?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>It depends on the amount of sun, but a single 2W BuzzSol solar panel should be able to charge the BuzzBar in about 8 hours. 3 panels with good irradiance would charge the BuzzBar at about the same speed as a wall outlet (i.e. fast!). <br/></p>
<h4>How long does the BuzzBat take to fully charge via BuzzBar?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>4 AA together with 2 AAA batteries in the BuzzBat <i>will not</i> fully charge the BuzzBar. The BuzzBat is an emergency solution which can be used when all other sources of power are exhausted or unavailable. For example, if the power fails at night, you can pilfer the batteries from gadgets around the house to get an emergency charge for your cell phone. One or more batteries will do the trick! <br/></p>
<h4>How long does the BuzzCell take to fully charge the BuzzBar?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>BuzzCell is currently being designed to charge BuzzBar to 50% (about one cell charge) within 4 hours. The BuzzCell is expected to be available in Q4 2014.<br/></p>

See below for full details on how the BuzzBar Suite works.How it works:





The heart of The BuzzBar Suite is the BuzzBar – a compact lithium-ion battery that can store enough energy to recharge any device that uses USB. What makes the BuzzBar so unique is that it is the ONLY product that can be recharged using a variety of energy sources. You can plug it in to a wall outlet (grid), or use solar power (BuzzSol), fuel cells (BuzzCell), and even AA and AAA (BuzzBat) batteries. It's small enough to slip into your purse, backpack, briefcase, or even your back pocket.


That pretty much makes the BuzzBar the perfect on-demand power solution for any scenario.We've even designed the BuzzBar Suite so up to 3 BuzzSol solar panel attachments (additional units sold separately) can be chained together for faster charging in the sun. The BuzzSol panels stack neatly together for ultra-compact storage.
The BuzzBar provides enough energy to recharge a typical smartphone, tablet, GPS, or digital camera, making The BuzzBar Suite an essential addition to your travel and disaster preparedness kits.The BuzzBar Suite will also include BuzzCell  – a compact 
fuel-cell technology that you can take anywhere and use day or night. You'll be able to order fuel cell cartridges for about $1 each (projected pricing) and send used cartridges back to us for refilling and re-use. Who needs a BuzzBar?
You do. Everyone should expect the unexpected. When the power goes out, especially in a disaster, you absolutely need a way to keep your mobile phone charged. Add The BuzzBar Suite to your disaster preparedness kits and stay safe. Visit ready.gov for more information about how to keep yourself and your family safe in the event of a disaster. We bet you can think of a few occasions when you wished you had a BuzzBar handy!

 It is through our professional experience and training that we have
developed a solid understanding of what it means to provide exceptional
customer service, and to exceed client expectations.</p>
<p>Over the past 11 years, we have worked as independent real
estate professionals, providing brokerage, project management and consulting
services.  In order to accomplish the goals of our clients, we must engage,
qualify, and rely upon the services of other service professionals.  What we have come to realize is that the process of qualifying these professionals, in
order to feel comfortable/well informed enough to make hiring decisions in high
stakes situations, is time consuming, inefficient, and considerably risky due to
the lack and reliability of information available or provided.  We have
also discovered that there is a lot of mediocrity out there in terms of the
level of service provided, and that this mediocrity translates into a lack of
accountability, diligence, responsiveness, and many other what we consider, “key
competencies” that every service professional should possess.  Wouldn’t it
be nice if there was a more efficient and reliable way to qualify service
professionals?  Wouldn’t it also be nice if there was some <u>standard</u> to
which all service professionals were upheld, to both eliminate mediocrity, and to
reward those who strive for excellence?</p>
<p>We, as well as many others, have been affected by these
deficiencies in the service industry.  For the past two years we have worked to develop solutions to the above mentioned problems. 
Our solution is <b><i>Service
Score (svcscore.com)</i></b>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at each problem in a bit more detail to better
understand how Service Score provides a solution:</p>
<p><u>PROBLEM 1 – TIME CONSUMING, INEFFICIENT &amp; RISKY QUALIFYING
PROCESS</u>: 
Unless you get a referral from a <u>very</u> trusted source (emphasis on very
because one person’s opinion of quality is not necessarily another’s), the
process of gathering information to qualify service professionals is both time
consuming and inefficient.  From our experience, this process usually begins with an Internet search for a specific
type of service or service professional (for example, Civil Engineers in San
Francisco), followed by a screening procedure that requires the reference of
multiple resources (company website, Yelp, etc.) in order to gather enough
information to feel confident in further engagement via phone or email. 
Often times the pre-qualifying phone call or email isn't sufficient
alone.  Additional confidence in the hiring process is likely only
achieved after collecting feedback from professional references, so a list of
such references must be compiled and contacted.  The problem is that we
are typically only provided access to positive endorsements when fully informed
and less risky decision making requires the review of both good and bad
references.</p>
<p>Service Score, like other review sites, relies on data from those
who evaluate service professionals with whom they have worked.  This is
where the similarities end.  Utilizing an
efficient 5 step review process, specific and relevant information is requested
and collected from the reviewer about the service professional and overall experience,
as opposed to the more common practice among review sites of allowing general,
unguided and often emotional reviews that lack factual information necessary
for decision making in high stakes situations. 
</p>
<p>Review information can be accessed through a free search by service
professional’s name, company name, type of service, keyword, or any combination
of these parameters.  The search results
will yield the following per service professional:</p>
<p>1.  Contextual evaluations of past assignments</p>
<p>2.  How they scored on 11 Key Competencies, aka their
“Service Score” (See Problem 2 below)</p>
<p>We strongly believe that those writing reviews should exercise
the same level of accountability that they expect from the service
professionals that they hire.  In other
words, Service Score will not allow anonymous reviews.  Reviewers must stand behind their reviews and
are encouraged to be a professional reference. 
Accordingly, the search results will also yield:</p>
<p>3.  Access to professional references (both the good and the
bad)</p>
<p>Coupled with professional experience/qualifications that service
professionals can upload to the site as part of their “Service Profile"",
all of the information needed for informed decision making is in one
place.  To summarize, Service Score is a validated, searchable database of
service professionals’ experience, key competencies, professional references,
and evaluations of past assignments.  </p>
<p><u>PROBLEM 2 – NO STANDARD</u>:  In today’s world, there are numerous standards or
process/procedural guidelines put in place to ensure quality and consistency in
the deliverables.  Why is there no such standard to ensure quality and
consistency in the level and type of service provided by those hired to perform/deliver
a service?  Without such a standard, there really isn’t any mechanism for
quality control, or repercussions for that matter, if the standards are or
aren’t upheld.  Through the use of a rating/scoring system based on 11 Key
Competencies relevant to all service professionals, Service Score aims to
create this standard. </p>
<p>Through the review process, evaluators will score service
professionals with whom they have worked on any applicable key competency
listed below:</p>
<p>1.  Accountable</p>
<p>2.  Ethical</p>
<p>3.  Pleasant to
deal with</p>
<p>4.  Communicates
&amp; listens effectively</p>
<p>5.  Diligent/goes
above and beyond</p>
<p>6. 
Knowledgeable/experienced</p>
<p>7.  Progressive/solution
oriented</p>
<p>8.  Responsive</p>
<p>9.  Flexible</p>
<p>10.  Efficient</p>
<p>11.  Punctual</p>
<p>The scoring system is based on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being
“exceptional” and anything below 5 being “poor”.  The score per individual
competency, per review is then added together to come up with that service
professional’s overall “Service Score”.  The higher one’s Service Score,
the higher up that individual would fall on a search results page, thus
incentivizing quality service (or a higher Service Score) to give one the best
chance of getting selected for future assignments, and rewarding those who
consistently provide quality service.  In addition, those searching will
be able to see how a specific individual scored per key competency, which will
inevitably factor into the hiring decision making process.  Over time, a
service professional’s Service Score will become a standard, something that
those looking to hire will look at and weigh with importance, and that service
professionals will take seriously as it will affect their livelihoods.</p>
<p><u>THE IMPACTS</u>:  Aside from those benefits already described in detail
above, Service Score will also prove to have an impact in the following ways:</p>
<p>1)  Access to better and more reliable data will facilitate fully informed hiring decision making, and will ultimately help mitigate mistakes in
the hiring process, which cost employers time, money, and resources.</p>
<p>2)  Comprehensive and relevant reviews about individuals.  Most reviews today are about organizations as
a whole rather than those individuals that make up a company and actually
interface with the customers.  Those reviews that are about individuals do
not highlight enough relevant/reliable information to allow for fully informed decision
making.</p>
<p>3)  Service Score will establish a <u>fair</u> ranking system.  Today’s search
offers an unfair exposure advantage to those companies/individuals with large
marketing budgets.  Through a Service Score search, the order in which the results are displayed is actually based on merit (the highest Service Score),
or a combination of merit and professional experience/qualifications.</p>
<p>4)  The platform encourages and facilitates resolution
between service professionals and their customers.  Not only can service
professionals respond to or clarify negative reviews in the form of a review
rebuttal, but should such resolution occur, a negative review can be removed
from that service professional’s profile, thereby raising their overall Service
Score.</p>
<p>5)  Litigation mitigation.  Often times the only
recourse in dealing with a service professional that lacks accountability is a
long, drawn out and expensive legal process.  The vision is that one’s
Service Score will carry enough weight and influence that service professionals
will put in the time and effort necessary to resolve issues with their
customers and avoid a blemish to their Service Score.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we are calling for a new system/structure that will
empower both service professionals and their customers, and will elevate the
service industry as a whole.  We cannot accomplish this mission without
your contributions and support (monetary and other).</p>
<p><u>NEXT STEPS</u>:  We have spent the last two years working on the
preliminary design and functionality of the Service Score website.  We are
now at the stage where we need to hire a developer to build the web based
interface and start beta testing.  It has been determined that we will
need at least $50,000 to accomplish this next step. </p>
<p>The website will have three main functions:  1) It will be
the database that will accept the input and collection of review
information.  2) It will allow for the creation of a Service Profile page
to highlight service professionals’ experience/qualifications and other
details.  3) It will be the search interface, allowing the input of search
parameters so that those who are seeking can find a type of service or service
professional.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have a physical product that we can
offer in exchange for a funding contribution.  What we can offer is: 1)
Appreciation and recognition as a funding partner, broadcast through the
Service Score homepage and 2) If you are a contributing service
professional, a premium Service Profile page which offers additional
functionality and benefits (for example posting rebuttals to reviews) from the
standard free profile page.  See ""Perks"" section for more
details.</p>
<p><u>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</u>:  If you can’t make a monetary contribution, there are
other equally important ways that you can help:  1) Spread the word about
Service Score so that we can reach our funding goal.  2) If you are a
service professional, encourage your clients to review your past assignments once
the site goes live.  3) Once the site goes live, write reviews (both good
and bad) about those service professionals that you have worked with, and be a
professional reference.  </p><br/></div>","We have collectively worked in the service industry for our entire careers (going on 30 years), providing some type of service to a customer base.

the same level of accountability that they expect from the service
professionals that they hire.  In other
words, Service Score will not allow anonymous reviews.  Reviewers must stand behind their reviews and
are encouraged to be a professional reference. 
Accordingly, the search results will also yield:
3.  Access to professional references (both the good and the
bad)
Coupled with professional experience/qualifications that service
professionals can upload to the site as part of their “Service Profile"",
all of the information needed for informed decision making is in one
place.  To summarize, Service Score is a validated, searchable database of
service professionals’ experience, key competencies, professional references,
and evaluations of past assignments.  
PROBLEM 2 – NO STANDARD:  In today’s world, there are numerous standards or
process/procedural guidelines put in place to ensure quality and consistency in
the deliverables.  Why is there no such standard to ensure quality and
consistency in the level and type of service provided by those hired to perform/deliver
a service?  Without such a standard, there really isn’t any mechanism for
quality control, or repercussions for that matter, if the standards are or
aren’t upheld.  Through the use of a rating/scoring system based on 11 Key
Competencies relevant to all service professionals, Service Score aims to
create this standard. 
Through the review process, evaluators will score service
professionals with whom they have worked on any applicable key competency
listed below:
1.  Accountable
2.  Ethical
3.  Pleasant to
deal with
4.  Communicates
& listens effectively
5.  Diligent/goes
above and beyond
6. 
Knowledgeable/experienced
7.  Progressive/solution
oriented
8.  Responsive
9.  Flexible
10.  Efficient
11.  Punctual
The scoring system is based on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being
“exceptional” and anything below 5 being “poor”.  The score per individual
competency, per review is then added together to come up with that service
professional’s overall “Service Score”.  The higher one’s Service Score,
the higher up that individual would fall on a search results page, thus
incentivizing quality service (or a higher Service Score) to give one the best
chance of getting selected for future assignments, and rewarding those who
consistently provide quality service.  In addition, those searching will
be able to see how a specific individual scored per key competency, which will
inevitably factor into the hiring decision making process.  Over time, a
service professional’s Service Score will become a standard, something that
those looking to hire will look at and weigh with importance, and that service
professionals will take seriously as it will affect their livelihoods.
THE IMPACTS:  Aside from those benefits already described in detail
above, Service Score will also prove to have an impact in the following ways:
1)  Access to better and more reliable data will facilitate fully informed hiring decision making, and will ultimately help mitigate mistakes in
the hiring process, which cost employers time, money, and resources.
2)  Comprehensive and relevant reviews about individuals.  Most reviews today are about organizations as
a whole rather than those individuals that make up a company and actually
interface with the customers.  Those reviews that are about individuals do
not highlight enough relevant/reliable information to allow for fully informed decision
making.
3)  Service Score will establish a fair ranking system.  Today’s search
offers an unfair exposure advantage to those companies/individuals with large
marketing budgets.  Through a Service Score search, the order in which the results are displayed is actually based on merit (the highest Service Score),
or a combination of merit and professional experience/qualifications.
4)  The platform encourages and facilitates resolution
between service professionals and their customers.  Not only can service
professionals respond to or clarify negative reviews in the form of a review
rebuttal, but should such resolution occur, a negative review can be removed
from that service professional’s profile, thereby raising their overall Service
Score.
5)  Litigation mitigation.  Often times the only
recourse in dealing with a service professional that lacks accountability is a
long, drawn out and expensive legal process.  The vision is that one’s
Service Score will carry enough weight and influence that service professionals
will put in the time and effort necessary to resolve issues with their
customers and avoid a blemish to their Service Score.
Ultimately, we are calling for a new system/structure that will
empower both service professionals and their customers, and will elevate the
service industry as a whole.  We cannot accomplish this mission without
your contributions and support (monetary and other).
NEXT STEPS:  We have spent the last two years working on the
preliminary design and functionality of the Service Score website.  We are
now at the stage where we need to hire a developer to build the web based
interface and start beta testing.  It has been determined that we will
need at least $50,000 to accomplish this next step. 
The website will have three main functions:  1) It will be
the database that will accept the input and collection of review
information.  2) It will allow for the creation of a Service Profile page
to highlight service professionals’ experience/qualifications and other
details.  3) It will be the search interface, allowing the input of search
parameters so that those who are seeking can find a type of service or service
professional.
Unfortunately, we don’t have a physical product that we can
offer in exchange for a funding contribution.  What we can offer is: 1)
Appreciation and recognition as a funding partner, broadcast through the
Service Score homepage and 2) If you are a contributing service
professional, a premium Service Profile page which offers additional
functionality and benefits (for example posting rebuttals to reviews) from the
standard free profile page.  See ""Perks"" section for more
details.
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:  If you can’t make a monetary contribution, there are
other equally important ways that you can help:  1) Spread the word about
Service Score so that we can reach our funding goal.  2) If you are a
service professional, encourage your clients to review your past assignments once
the site goes live.  3) Once the site goes live, write reviews (both good
and bad) about those service professionals that you have worked with, and be a
professional reference.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p align=""left""><strong>LoRa</strong> is a wireless technology developed to create the low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) required for machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The technology offers a very compelling mix of long range, low power consumption and secure data transmission and is gaining significant traction in IoT networks being deployed by wireless network operators.</p>
<p align=""left"">A network based on LoRa wireless technology can provide coverage that is greater in range compared to that of existing cellular networks. In fact, many mobile network operators have chosen to complement their existing cellular/wireless networks with a LPWAN based on LoRa technology because it is easy to plug into their existing infrastructure and also allows them to offer their customers a solution to serve more IoT battery-operated applications.</p>
<p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479362613/sukztxdzi9fpgdwtqlg7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Dragino Lora IoT Kit</strong> is designed to facilitate beginners and developers to quickly learn LoRa and IoT technology. It help users to turn the idea into a practical application and make the Internet of Things a reality. It is easy to program, create and connect your things everywhere. A number of telecom operators are currently rolling out networks, but because LoRa operates in the open spectrum you can also set up your own network. The LoRa IoT kit will show how to build LoRa network, and how to use the network to send data from a LoRa sensor node to the cloud server. When used as a private LoRa network, the LoRa gateway will connect your other LoRa nodes up to 5km however expect up to 10km range (when in line of sight) when connecting your LoRa node to a LoRa gateway!</p>
<p align=""left"">For the past months we've worked hard to get the LoRa IoT Kit to the final stages of development. We have got some users to start using LoRa IoT Kit. To make the final step and start mass-production, we need your help. If you back us, you will speed up the LoRa IoT Kit production and receive one of it in 01/2017, but you'll also receive one yourself in 03/2017. So to start to build your own LoRa Network and examine the IoT technology, we are trying to provide a full solution to connect LoRa to different cloud server  there’s nothing like what Dragino LoRa IoT Kit can provide.</p>

</div></div>","LoRa is a wireless technology developed to create the low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) required for machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The technology offers a very compelling mix of long range, low power consumption and secure data transmission and is gaining significant traction in IoT networks being deployed by wireless network operators.
A network based on LoRa wireless technology can provide coverage that is greater in range compared to that of existing cellular networks. In fact, many mobile network operators have chosen to complement their existing cellular/wireless networks with a LPWAN based on LoRa technology because it is easy to plug into their existing infrastructure and also allows them to offer their customers a solution to serve more IoT battery-operated applications.

Dragino Lora IoT Kit is designed to facilitate beginners and developers to quickly learn LoRa and IoT technology. It help users to turn the idea into a practical application and make the Internet of Things a reality. It is easy to program, create and connect your things everywhere. A number of telecom operators are currently rolling out networks, but because LoRa operates in the open spectrum you can also set up your own network. The LoRa IoT kit will show how to build LoRa network, and how to use the network to send data from a LoRa sensor node to the cloud server. When used as a private LoRa network, the LoRa gateway will connect your other LoRa nodes up to 5km however expect up to 10km range (when in line of sight) when connecting your LoRa node to a LoRa gateway!
For the past months we've worked hard to get the LoRa IoT Kit to the final stages of development. We have got some users to start using LoRa IoT Kit. To make the final step and start mass-production, we need your help. If you back us, you will speed up the LoRa IoT Kit production and receive one of it in 01/2017, but you'll also receive one yourself in 03/2017. So to start to build your own LoRa Network and examine the IoT technology, we are trying to provide a full solution to connect LoRa to different cloud server  there’s nothing like what Dragino LoRa IoT Kit can provide.

<p>What a difference a year makes! From an idea we developed after a rough trip to Central America, launched on Kickstarter, debuted at International CES, and delivered to our backers across the world, we are so happy that ZEROHOUR XD has been a success.</p>
<p>As we began thinking about our next ZEROHOUR product, we knew we wanted to build a more compact, everyday carry version of the XD. Our first product was based on features that WE needed, but we wanted our new ZEROHOUR to reflect what YOU needed.</p>
<p>We reviewed comments and messages to find the most-requested features that didn’t make it into the XD. We reached out to our fellow “flashaholics"" on flashlight discussion forums for feedback. We made it our goal to squeeze as much as possible into a smaller, more affordable flashlight that still maintained the high standards we built our name on. After months of meetings and lots of coffee, we came up with a design that includes the best of the best, adds our own ZEROHOUR twist, and absolutely makes us proud.</p>

ZEROHOUR RELIC XR
ZEROHOUR XR is a compact USB rechargeable tactical flashlight with variable control ring, tail-cap switch, and waterproof battery backup all-in-one. Our first project, ZEROHOUR XD, set new standards for flashlights by offering the ultimate integration of light and power, and on that foundation we’ve built a new device that is smaller and lighter yet gives you even more control:
Tactical-Grade Compact Flashlight
Constructed with aircraft aluminum and achieving a 1,000 lumen output with the game-changing Cree XLamp XP-L LED, ZEROHOUR XR continues our dedication to best in class design materials.

Featuring an all-new variable control ring that allows maximum flexibility in choosing brightness from 0 to 1000 lumens, plus the option to click into XR's preset modes (10 lumens, 1000 lumens, Strobe, and SOS).

Micro-USB Rechargeable Battery Backup
Keep ZEROHOUR XR with you wherever you go for that extra boost of backup power: its 3400mAh lithium-ion battery provides at least a full charge for your smartphones and cameras.

Our newly-designed, waterproof center ring untwists for easy access to the 2.1 amp port to charge your devices, and micro-USB port to charge the flashlight.

Versatile Design
ZEROHOUR XR incorporates many highly requested new features, including a tail-cap switch with momentary-on click setting, multiple battery configurations (18650 and CR123), anti-roll clip, removable stainless steel head and tail bezel, and large tail-cap holes for paracord support.
Coming in at 6.25 inches and 6 ounces, our lighter XR is highly adaptable to your needs, fits standard 1” bike mounts, weapon mounts, or belt holsters, and is easy to tuck away in your backpack, purse, or pocket.
Whether you're indoors or outdoors, on the go or on the job, ready for adventure or just keeping safe, ZEROHOUR XR is the perfect choice to power and light your way.
ZEROHOUREVOLUTION
""Kickstarter illuminates goal for flashlight company” - OC Register
""CES 2014: Startups steal the show” - CNet
""The ZeroHour XD is one of the most versatile flashlights we saw at the Outdoor Retailer Summer Market last week” - Gizmag
What a difference a year makes! From an idea we developed after a rough trip to Central America, launched on Kickstarter, debuted at International CES, and delivered to our backers across the world, we are so happy that ZEROHOUR XD has been a success.
As we began thinking about our next ZEROHOUR product, we knew we wanted to build a more compact, everyday carry version of the XD. Our first product was based on features that WE needed, but we wanted our new ZEROHOUR to reflect what YOU needed.
We reviewed comments and messages to find the most-requested features that didn’t make it into the XD. We reached out to our fellow “flashaholics"" on flashlight discussion forums for feedback. We made it our goal to squeeze as much as possible into a smaller, more affordable flashlight that still maintained the high standards we built our name on. After months of meetings and lots of coffee, we came up with a design that includes the best of the best, adds our own ZEROHOUR twist, and absolutely makes us proud.

<h3>Andrew Hartley</h3>
<p>Everyone knows and loves the legendary Andrew ""Kid Thunder"" Hartley.  He has entertained for years with his action packed fights and online hijinx.</p>
<p>He has not made a lot of money being the 24-fight professional that you would expect.</p>
<p>In fact, what he has made throughout his career doesn't even add up to a decent salary for one year.</p>
<p>Andrew was forced to give up what he loved doing (boxing) and went into the medical field as a male nurse.  Unfortunately there were co-workers jealous of him and his fame as a worldly recognized athlete, Andrew was let go.</p>
<p>With not many fighters reluctant to accept his challenge, Andrew is forced to stay in the gym training day and night for a fight.  A fight to enshrine his legacy and to pay his bills.</p>
<p>Andrew is a loving and supporting father.  It is not always easy to be able to put food on the table for his children. But he finds a way.  </p>

<h3>GOAL</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that phone bills are expensive.  Andrew's phone bill is $50 per month.  We are asking for as much help as possible to assist Andrew in covering those expenses.</p>
<p>Andrew hosts the popular radio show ""The Kid Thunder Diaries"" as well as he weekly prayer line every Sunday morning to help troubled youth go on the straight and arrow.</p>

Our goal is simple: we want to protect people around the world from the mass surveillance that is currently being perpetrated by governments and corporations around the world.</p><p></p><p>We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right that must be protected at any cost. The advent of the internet has now made all of us more vulnerable to mass surveillance than at any other point in human history. The disappearance of online privacy is a very dangerous trend as in many ways privacy and freedom go hand in hand.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/640187/files/20140610185949-hosted.jpg?1402451989"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p> ProtonMail uses breakthrough web technologies and proven cryptographic algorithms to protect your privacy. Because of our end-to-end encryption, your data is already encrypted by the time it reaches our servers. We have no access to your messages, and since we cannot decrypt them, we cannot share them with third parties. We host all our servers in Switzerland outside US and EU jurisdiction so all user data is protected by strict Swiss privacy laws.</p><p></p><p>We feel that the best way to guard against mass surveillance is to give encryption to everybody by making it free and easy to use. This is why ProtonMail works out of any modern web browser, and why we went to great lengths to make the complex cryptography completely invisible to the user. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/640193/files/20140610190249-iphone.jpg?1402452169"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>

ProtonMail accounts are also fully backwards compatible with existing email so you can continue to send and receive email from friends who aren’t using ProtonMail. We believe the world deserves better email which is why we've also developed a full line of extra email features:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/637444/files/20140609195643-features.jpg?1402369003"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

With some luck, it will be enough for us to get ProtonMail out of beta. This will allow us to introduce paid accounts with additional storage after which the ProtonMail project can be self-sustaining.</p><p>However, we have a much bigger vision for ProtonMail, and we need your help to hire and expand our team.

Additional funding will also allow us to build a stronger service that is more resilient to attacks and outside pressure. With your support, we can make internet privacy a reality again and protect freedom around the world.<br/><br/></p><p></p><p>

Our goal is simple: we want to protect people around the world from the mass surveillance that is currently being perpetrated by governments and corporations around the world.We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right that must be protected at any cost. The advent of the internet has now made all of us more vulnerable to mass surveillance than at any other point in human history. The disappearance of online privacy is a very dangerous trend as in many ways privacy and freedom go hand in hand. ProtonMail uses breakthrough web technologies and proven cryptographic algorithms to protect your privacy. Because of our end-to-end encryption, your data is already encrypted by the time it reaches our servers. We have no access to your messages, and since we cannot decrypt them, we cannot share them with third parties. We host all our servers in Switzerland outside US and EU jurisdiction so all user data is protected by strict Swiss privacy laws.We feel that the best way to guard against mass surveillance is to give encryption to everybody by making it free and easy to use. This is why ProtonMail works out of any modern web browser, and why we went to great lengths to make the complex cryptography completely invisible to the user. 
Your email is encrypted by default and can be accessed from your home computer, laptop, tablet and your iPhone or Android device effortlessly. ProtonMail accounts are also fully backwards compatible with existing email so you can continue to send and receive email from friends who aren’t using ProtonMail. We believe the world deserves better email which is why we've also developed a full line of extra email features:
The first $100,000 will give us enough money to buy and host the servers we need to support all users currently on our waiting list. With some luck, it will be enough for us to get ProtonMail out of beta. This will allow us to introduce paid accounts with additional storage after which the ProtonMail project can be self-sustaining.However, we have a much bigger vision for ProtonMail, and we need your help to hire and expand our team. Below are some of our stretch goals:We will build these features even if the targets are not met, but without additional funding, it will take us much much longer. Additional funding will also allow us to build a stronger service that is more resilient to attacks and outside pressure. With your support, we can make internet privacy a reality again and protect freedom around the world.

""The only email system the NSA can't access"" – Forbes
""ProtonMail's security measures are intense: end-to-end encryption and user authentication protocols so rigorous even the creators can't read user emails."" – Huffington Post
""Three young entreprenuers, inspired by their time at CERN have launched ProtonMail, a secure email service with a sophisticated encryption system to deter would-be spies."" – CERN News
""A new email service being developed by a group from MIT and CERN promises to bring secure, encrypted email to the masses and keep sensitive information away from prying eyes."" – Boston Herald
""By incorporating the company in a country with some of the most strict privacy laws in the world, the developers keep the system out of the legal jurisdiction of both the U.S. and the European Union."" – USA Today
""ProtonMail won’t have access to encryption keys and they won’t log personally identifiable information such as IP addresses."" – TechSpot
""All in all, I was quite impressed by ProtonMail. The service doesn’t sacrifice simplicity for the sake of security."" – Cryptocoins NewsWhen we launched our public beta on May 16th we immediately had tens of thousands of users from around the world sign up which rapidly exceeded our server capacity.  We are working hard to accommodate everybody, but with many more users still on our waiting list, we simply need more resources.We firmly believe that ProtonMail can only succeed in its mission if it remains independent. By raising money through crowd funding, we can ensure that our first and only priority is protecting the privacy of our users. There are certain powerful governments and corporations out there who are in the business of controlling and exploiting personal data that will try to hinder us. If we want to live in a future where privacy on the internet is respected, we must stand together now and fight for those rights. With your support, we can make this brighter future a reality.
Basic ProtonMail accounts are free and will always be free, because many of the people most in need for email that is secure against government surveillance, are also the ones least able to pay. We do however have some special perks for ProtonMail contributors. Most contributors will get priority access on our waiting list which means you will be first in line to get a ProtonMail account as soon as we have capacity. Larger contributors will also get one year of ProtonMail+ which is a premium account that provides an additional 1GB of storage space.Finally, it is also possible to get an exclusive ProtonMail T-shirt!


The ProtonMail team includes 5 developers who met while working at CERN and MIT, and have strong backgrounds in software, computing, and mathematics. Our core development team includes:


Jason StockmanJason is responsible for designing ProtonMail's user interface and front end encryption. He has over 10 years of software development experience working with large organizations such as Epson, 3M, Versace, and the International Red Cross.



Andy YenAndy has over 8 years of experience in distributed computing for advanced particle physics applications. He has worked at CERN since 2009 on the ATLAS Experiment and studied physics and economics at Harvard and Caltech.


Wei SunWei is our lead backend developer and resident cryptography expert. He builds software for the RE1 Experiment at CERN and is the author of numerous theoretical physics papers. Wei studied physics at MIT.In addition, we have a dedicated support team focused on providing the best user experience:

Mariana FerreiraMariana is responsible for gathering feedback and communicating with ProtonMail users worldwide. Mariana graduated from the International School of Lausanne before studying Public Relations at Boston University.



Dayne DavisDayne is in charge of technical support and helps to ensure ProtonMail works well. Dayne studies Computer Science at Harvard University and builds many of our customer support tools. He is also a Bitcoin enthusiast.

The notification email is the non-ProtonMail email address you used when registering on our waiting list. With that, we will be able to make sure your perk is delivered. If you are not on our waiting list, you can already reserve your username here: https://protonmail.ch/invite/index.phpMake sure your Notification Email (not your ProtonMail address) matches the email you use when you donate on Indiegogo.If you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to contact us at indiegogo@protonmail.chIs ProtonMail Free?Yes, ProtonMail accounts will always be available for free. In the future, we will have additional features like extra storage that will cost a small amount of money each month and will help us pay the bills.Does using ProtonMail really mean the NSA cannot read any of my emails?As a general principle, it is impossible to have 100% safety. More details about the threats that ProtonMail can defend against and those it cannot can be found here: https://protonmail.ch/blog/protonmail-threat-model/How is ProtonMail funded so far?So far, just out of the life savings of our founders.

<br/><br/><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are so excited to launch and share with the Indiegogo
community the first wireless HD portable projector: the <b>Pro-X,</b> which is
compatible with all phones, tablets, and PCs ( Apple, Android, Windows). </p>
<p>The namesake of <b>Pro-X</b> is “pro” for “projector,” and “X,”
as in Algebra, where the X can be any number. It’s the same concept here. The <b>Pro-X</b>
 is Compatible with all Apple, Android, and
Window devices. With your help, we will be able to produce this amazing new
device, which is battery-operated, allowing sharing and viewing in unlimited
ways.</p>
<p>We are thrilled with <b>Pro-X,</b> and we think you will be
too. We hope you will support our campaign with contributions and by spreading
the word to your community!</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p>The <b>Pro-X</b> STORY</p>
<p>How many times have you
wanted to share a funny video or picture with your friends and you had to pass
the phone or tablet around to everyone? Or how about going into a meeting, and
wanting everyone in the room to see your presentation or idea without worrying
if they had a projecting device already set up there.
Or didn’t you ever wish you could be spontaneous, and have a romantic dinner on
the roof or the park with romantic images or videos playing in the background? Or
how about watching a movie or sharing pictures when you have those big family
gatherings. Everywhere and anywhere: that was the inspiration for the <b>Pro-X</b>.
We came up with an idea that combined all our devices into one viewing point.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/880991/files/20140925020433-IMG_8864.jpg?1411635873"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/><br/><p></p>
<p>We wanted a product that could handle all our devices (phones,
tablets, PCs) in a more convenient way. Before the <b>Pro-X</b>, the only way we could achieve what we desired was to hook up
a computer to a bulky projector (prone to inconvenient overheating). Long story
short, that search for the ultra-convenient projector morphed into the initial
idea.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/907709/files/20141006062635-DESC-page-0__1_.jpg?1412601995"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>For the creation of <b>Pro-X</b>, a multi-functional, portable visual
display solves a slew of A/V problems, and opens the door to a limitless
universe of content sharing possibilities. It’s battery powered, wireless,  compact,
and connects effortlessly with the Internet. Necessity sparked invention, and
we haven’t looked back since<br/></p>

We are so excited to launch and share with the Indiegogo
community the first wireless HD portable projector: the Pro-X, which is
compatible with all phones, tablets, and PCs ( Apple, Android, Windows). 
The namesake of Pro-X is “pro” for “projector,” and “X,”
as in Algebra, where the X can be any number. It’s the same concept here. The Pro-X
 is Compatible with all Apple, Android, and
Window devices. With your help, we will be able to produce this amazing new
device, which is battery-operated, allowing sharing and viewing in unlimited
ways.
We are thrilled with Pro-X, and we think you will be
too. We hope you will support our campaign with contributions and by spreading
the word to your community!






WHAT CAN I DO WITH Pro-X?


The Pro-X is an ideal product for people who enjoy
viewing and sharing their content and data from different platforms. The pro-X
can be used in a lot of ways to make our day-to-day lives easier and more
convenient, basically allowing you to have one product that is compatible with
all of your devices.
The Pro-X can be used in numerous ways; here are few
of the ways you can enjoy your Pro-X.



  Mirror or cast your phone
(Apple or Android) onto a wider screen and share with everyone.


  Mirror or cast your tablet
(Apple or Android) onto a wider screen and share with everyone.


  Mirror or cast your computer/laptop
( Apple or Android and Windows) onto a wider screen and share with everyone.


  Always be able to share the
content and data of your memory card or USB drive.


  Connect up to four
different devices simultaneously, and share the fun.


  Stream movies from Netflix
and Hulu, or your favorite website.


  Watch your favorite sport
on a bigger screen.


  Access files from Dropbox,  Skydrive, or iCloud. 


  Be confident in meetings
that you can share your data and ideas with everyone.


  Surf the web, and view docs,
slides, and photos.


  Play video games on a
bigger screen.


  Express your creativity in
new ways—use a projection as a guide to paint murals, trace pictures, and much,
much more.


  These are just some of the
activities you can accomplish with the Pro-X.


  We are sure that you will
think of thousands of other ways.








The Pro-X STORY
How many times have you
wanted to share a funny video or picture with your friends and you had to pass
the phone or tablet around to everyone? Or how about going into a meeting, and
wanting everyone in the room to see your presentation or idea without worrying
if they had a projecting device already set up there.
Or didn’t you ever wish you could be spontaneous, and have a romantic dinner on
the roof or the park with romantic images or videos playing in the background? Or
how about watching a movie or sharing pictures when you have those big family
gatherings. Everywhere and anywhere: that was the inspiration for the Pro-X.
We came up with an idea that combined all our devices into one viewing point.






We wanted a product that could handle all our devices (phones,
tablets, PCs) in a more convenient way. Before the Pro-X, the only way we could achieve what we desired was to hook up
a computer to a bulky projector (prone to inconvenient overheating). Long story
short, that search for the ultra-convenient projector morphed into the initial
idea.

For the creation of Pro-X, a multi-functional, portable visual
display solves a slew of A/V problems, and opens the door to a limitless
universe of content sharing possibilities. It’s battery powered, wireless,  compact,
and connects effortlessly with the Internet. Necessity sparked invention, and
we haven’t looked back since








   




Why pro-X (projector-X) ?












Risks & Challenges
One of the Biggest challenges we faced so far is finding the right manufacturer and working on the design, we spent a lot of late nights at the office working on the pro-X trying to make it perfect in all aspects :


Designing 


Quality


pricing


Manufacturing 


Engineering 


And after a whole lot of hard work we found everything that we need to launch the Pro-X.
Even with all that, there are still some risks we have to keep in mind , like inspection of the quality , the success of this campaign shipping and a lot more.
but thanks to a dedicated team we are ready for any challenges that come our way.

<h3>The Story </h3>
<p><strong>It all started two months ago.</strong></p>
<p>I woke up to go to work and saw the new Apple iPhone12 commercial.</p>
<p>I was fascinated, as always how beautiful the advertising was. Then I took a shower and I thought about the new MagSafe ecosystem that Apple had introduced with the new iPhone12 series.</p>
<p>Later that day I talked with my colleagues at work about the new iPhone and we thought about all the cool things that can possibly come up with the MagSafe system.</p>
<p>At that time the idea for a portable wireless Battery Pack was born. My friend told me that Apple had already come up with such a device like that.</p>
<p>But then we found out that they had not!</p>
<p>I thought to myself, soon or later someone will do it... Why don´t you take action and make it!</p> <p>This thought won´t let me go and I began my work. My knowledge as an engineering student helped me a lot. After weeks of research and development, design sketches, and more I found a manufacture that was capable to produce the product and we both combine our knowledge to make it happen.<strong> Now we are ready for mass production and with the support of 12.500€, we will be able to deliver the first international batch in early 2021!</strong></p>

<h3>Why Indiegogo</h3>
<p>Indiegogo is a proven start-up platform, whose community of “early adopters” vets, funds and helps refine new products and services in an efficient manner.</p>

Unless you’re planning to buy one of those easy-to-lose and pricey wireless headphones with limited battery life, you can’t charge your phone while listening to audio from wired headsets.The Auxillite converter was designed as a solution for dual charging and listening. Instead of purchasing completely new add-ons, The Auxillite external digital-to-analog converter (DAC) attaches to 3.5mm jack and lightning ports, allowing you to play audio and stay charged around the clock.   Simply Plug-in and Play!

As soon as Apple launched the iPhone 7, users have kicked up a fuss, and rightly so, by the fact that there is no port for their high-quality headphones. This created a unique gap in the market for new technology. In steps Auxillite. This cost effective, 2 in 1 converter lets every user keep their original headphones. Auxillite provides the ultimate sleek alternative, that’s no muss, no fuss.Introducing a dual functioning, charge and listening add-on isn’t exactly groundbreaking. However, it’s unique selling points make Auxillite the most portable, efficient and cost-effective converter on the market. Truth be told, we couldn’t imagine smartphones without a 3.5mm audio jack so that’s why we created Auxillite to ease users into the transition. Auxillite has the potential of becoming a must have add-on for your new smartphone, especially if you want to keep your original high-quality headphones.While there are plenty of wireless earbuds available, most of them can’t sustain a proper connection, have a rather short battery life and are easier to misplace, making Auxillite the perfect alternative.Android users and audiophiles out there, we heard your requests! After checking with our manufacturer, we are happy to announce that we now have another version of Auxillite that is specifically designed for Android devices. Built-in with quick charge technology and 24-bit audio, Auxillite in Android version simply makes your audio experience even more pleasurable. *Due to safety issues/design limitation, Auxillite in Android version doesn't support simultaneous music and charging.  Auxillite aims to restore the standard 3.5mm headphone jack to your smartphone and to resolve the dilemma of charging and listening to music at the same time. When we designed Auxillite, we put a lot of focus into each small, intricate detail, creating technology that’s so compact you wouldn't even know it’s there.             The Auxillite team is made up of individuals with numerous years of manufacturing experience. Our vision is simple - to bring simplicity back to jackless smartphone users, so they don’t have to resort to drills, or worry about carrying packs of adapters everywhere they go. We also believe that our users wouldn’t want to see their perfectly good, high-quality wired headphones head straight for the landfill, so we invented a cost effective way to keep them.For more information about the team please click here.

delivering new and existing technologies for the sole purpose of customer
convenience and ease of use. Our innovation stems from one fundamental belief: make technology work for you, not the other way around. GET CHARGED UP! Visit our website: www.helloxyra.com**DISCLAIMER: IMAGES IN THE ""PRE-PRODUCTION PROTOTYPE IMAGES"" SECTION BELOW ARE NOT DIGITALLY RECREATED. IMAGES ARE OF THE FINAL PRE-PRODUCTION WORKING PROTOTYPE.**
MAIN FEATURES

Why we made it
On average, we check our smartphones over 150 times a day for all sorts of things: talking, texting, social media, surfing the web, pictures/videos, gaming, and checking our bank accounts. Smartphone battery life has become a major problem for individuals that utilize their phones for the above reasons. Limitations in battery technology and the creation of power hungry apps are what give rise to the need for the XS powercardTM. Most people leave their home with two things: their phone and their wallet. Based on the cornerstones of portability, convenience, and elegance, XS powercardTM ,  a 2200 mAh portable
charger, designed to fit in a wallet, making it hard to
forget. It provides your phone with the juice it needs all throughout the day…conveniently.
Its additional features such as data storage, data transfer, built-in cables,
and single port charging eliminate the need to carry different
gadgets/accessories. 

Pre-production Prototype Images
Top and bottom views of the XS powercardTM
exemplifying its fundamentals: Portability, Convenience and Elegance.Measuring 82.5 mm in length, it is shorter than the length of a credit card (85.60mm), ensuring that it fits in the credit card slot of your wallet.The device was created to optimize the utilization of space and provide you with a sleek and smart look, while delivering 2200 mAh battery capacity, built-in cables, data storage, and smart circuitry.The XS powercardTM is designed to fit in the
topmost credit card slot of your wallet, making it hard to forget. Since it is designed to fit in the topmost credit card slot of your wallet, it does not add any additional thickness (over 6.3 mm) to your wallet. It effectively utilizes the space above existing credit cards to maximize battery and data storage capacities, while adding no additional thickness to your wallet.The device is equipped with an 8/16/32 GB detachable flash drive to facilitate easy data storage as well as sharing. Rather than having to give someone your XS powercardTM to share data, you can just give them the detachable flash drive. The device can charge your smartphone either fast (less efficient) or more efficiently (standard charging rate). It also has a tri-colored LED indicator that indicates the battery status of the XS powercard.Both USB and Micro USB/MFi Lightning Connector cables are embedded into the design of the device, eliminating the need to carry cables. The cables are strategically placed to circumvent any possibility of tangling.Stretched to its full length, the device measures 14.3 inches or 1.19 ft., allowing for a convenient charge.Single Port Smart Charging: When connected to a power source, the device prioritizes your smartphone and charges it to 100% first. On detecting your phone is at 100%, it starts charging itself to 100%. This feature works with wall adapters as well, so when you wake up in the morning, you have your smartphone and XS powercard each completely charged.Since both cables are embedded into the device, it enables data transfer/ sync between your smartphone and PC.In addition to a PC’s USB port, the XS powercardTM
is compatible with wall adapters. You can charge the device and your smartphone
through one power outlet.The device is specifically designed to allow you to easily talk/text while charging your smartphone. The Micro USB and MFi Lightning Connector tips are designed to fit with most phone cases. They are 100% compatible with official smartphone cases.The USB tip of the device is equipped with fortified metal, making it robust and safe for daily use.The XS powercardTM is available for both Micro USB and MFi Lightning Connector devices.Colors, Specifications & PerformanceCharging SpecificationsWant to compare?*6.3mm at the portion inserted into your wallet, 11.85 mm at the top. However, as seen in pictures on this campaign, the XS powercard is designed to fit in the topmost credit card slot of your wallet, with credit cards stacked in the bottom slots. Therefore, it adds only 6.3mm to your wallet’s thickness.** Prices on crowd funding campaign (Indiegogo/Kickstarter), not taking into account bulk order discounts for the XS powercard. For a 20 pack order, the price of each XS powercard goes down to $32.5.Note: Image of the XS powercard is NOT graphically designed. This is the real pre-production prototype.ColorsLimited Edition XS powercards*Note: Limited Edition XS powercards are available for purchase only during the course of this campaign. Where the funds will go & what you can getAs with
most startups, funding is crucial to XyraTM. With the help of
family, we have got to the point of having our final pre-production prototypes
tested and combat-ready.
However,
there are still fixed/variable costs we need to incur soon in order to get the
product to market and expand the business. Some of these include:
1)  Product/cable/flash
drive mold balances 
2)  Assembly
equipment and process balances
3)  Variable
costs for components
4)  Meeting
minimum order quantities to drive down production costs
5)  Hiring
employees to speed up and optimize the process 
to better serve you
6)  Marketing
costs

Some of
these costs, such as mold costs and assembly costs, are one-time fixed costs
that we require to pay balances for on completion. Some are variable costs,
which will help us deliver our product to you quicker.

This is where we need you
to help us out: We need $50,000 to meet our
fixed costs, hire efficient workers and place a minimum order quantity to
reduce per unit costs. This will enable us to provide YOU with a better product at a better
price…faster!With this funding, we will also be able to advertise our product and cater to the needs of people who, in our opinion (and hopefully yours), are missing out.For your supportive contributions we're offering several awesome perks.

Our perks give you the opportunity to purchase the XS
powercardTM at almost unreal discount rates, going up to even 35% off future retail value.
People who choose to wait until this campaign ends lose out on these discounts
and limited edition offers. We did this because we want to exemplify how much we appreciate your support. It
means a lot.
Goals & Stretch GoalsTimeline until deliveryWhat if we don't reach our goal?
For many of you who might be wondering, ""What if they don't reach their goal? Where will my funds go?"", we answer: they will all go into the production and delivery of your perks. The $50,000 pledge goal includes allocation of funds for expansion, such as hiring employees, marketing, meeting minimum order quantities to reduce costs, etc. If we do not reach our goal, we will forgo these expenses and put everything towards the production and delivery of your perks, even if it is at a higher production cost for us. You are our number one priority and your satisfaction is paramount. The total funds raised if we do not reach our goal will be allocated to creating a quality product for our Indiegogo backers. If you have contributed and selected a perk, you will receive it. Can't contribute? You can still help!We completely understand that some of you are just not able to contribute, even if you want to. However, you can still help us out. Here's how:
Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!
Use your Facebook status updates, Tweets, Instagram, etc. to create awareness
You can use Indiegogo's share tools to spread the word
That's all there is to it! This would really give us the boost we need while also making people's lives more convenient and less cumbersome. After all, that's what we're here to do. Thank you!                     FAQs

my XS powercard?Once our Indiegogo campaign ends, each of our backers who selected perks of $34

<p><strong>The unique design lets you turn the product into a reading light, a ceiling light or a portable light - depending on what you need. It takes 8-10 hours of good sunlight to charge the batteries full. It can also be charged with a wall adaptor or 12V car adaptor. The light can be regulated from low (50 hours) to medium (8 hours) to high (4 hours). You can also use it to charge mobile phones, and on top of that the bell lampshade works as a great sound amplifier when you insert your mobile phone into it for music or radio.  It´s like the Swiss Army Knife of solar lamps!</strong></p>
<p>Over the last 4 months we have travelled the world to test 10 prototypes. In the deep Norwegian woods and rural villages in Kenya, Tanzania and Bangladesh.  And people really love it!

</div></div>","This is a one time limited deal. Meaning that this is the only time you can get SlimStand. And we are offering only a limited amount of perks to raise the money we need.

How can I get SlimStand for free?
- You get 1 free SlimStand for every friend you refer. First you must get SlimStand so we have your e-mail and shipping address. Then for every person you refer you'll get 1 free SlimStand shipped with the ones you purchased. Simply tell your friends to add the line ""I was referred by (insert your e-mail address)"". -Don't forget to first get a perk or we won't be able to send you the free SlimStands.
International shipping is included in the price of every perk!


Hello Indiegogo
My name is Hristo, and I present you SlimStand. An easy to use and carry smartphone/tablet stand. Now your smartphones and tablets can stand on a surface without falling, so you can watch videos, use apps,take pictures,shoot video, etc with ease.


The idea for SlimStand came from my brother one day when we wanted to watch a YouTube video but couldn't get the Iphone to stand. So SLIM was born.
The money we're raising is for a kids orphanage(ages 3-8) in our town. As you know Christmas is coming and we wanted to raise money to get the kids some new clothes, food and toys for Christmas(considering the bad conditions they live in all year round). That's why this is a limited time campaign. And that's why the kids need you! Help these abandoned children have a nice Christmas. The one every kid should have - filled with happiness and hope. 
All the money raised (besides for manufacturing and shipping) will go to the kids at the orphanage! And that's why this is limited only till the campaign expires. We only intend to raise money for the kids for Christmas.


Here is how Slim looks and works. (scroll down for information about SLIM, why we need the money, why your should help and the FAQ):












For more check out the Gallery at the top.


Slim's available in a variety of colours. Simply specify what colour you want when you choose a perk. 

Since the process of manufacturing is easy we can manufacture even small amounts of SlimStands at a time. Meaning that we don't need s certain amount of purchases in order to start shipping them to you.

Wireless power transfer is around for years, wireless energy transmitted to  electrical load from a base or transmitter. Energy is sent through waves and on other end  an inductive coupling to electrical device, which can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device. There are some drawbacks are in this technology like power loss and distance limitations but still that's enough for the magic.<br/>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471704953/magnetic_levitation_xwerw4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Magnetic levitation or magnetic suspension is a method by which an object is suspended in the air with no support other than invisible magnetic fields. Magnetic force is used to counteract the effects of the gravitational acceleration and any other accelerations.</p>
<p>The two primary issues involved in magnetic levitation are lifting forces: providing an upward force sufficient to counteract gravity, and stability: ensuring that the system does not spontaneously slide or flip into a configuration where the lift is neutralized</p>

<p> By Combining the Induction Charging and Magnetic Levitation we got OvRcharge.</p>

<p> To achieve altitude and be able to charge wirelessly, phone requires a special case. that consists of two main parts, electricity receiver from the base and a Magnet to hold its position mid air. so we design ultra thin case to not only protects your investment but to go some levels and also powers it up all at same time. This case has a magnet that will help it to levitate &amp; it also has induction receiver for charging without cables.</p>
<p>**We offer most popular model's cases but it is not possible at the moment to carry all types of cases, in this case we are offering third party attachment to work with your own case and supplied magnet (so generally speaking it works with all kind of phones or most of em).  </p>

</div></div>","Wireless power transfer is around for years, wireless energy transmitted to  electrical load from a base or transmitter. Energy is sent through waves and on other end  an inductive coupling to electrical device, which can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device. There are some drawbacks are in this technology like power loss and distance limitations but still that's enough for the magic.


Magnetic levitation or magnetic suspension is a method by which an object is suspended in the air with no support other than invisible magnetic fields. Magnetic force is used to counteract the effects of the gravitational acceleration and any other accelerations.
The two primary issues involved in magnetic levitation are lifting forces: providing an upward force sufficient to counteract gravity, and stability: ensuring that the system does not spontaneously slide or flip into a configuration where the lift is neutralized






 By Combining the Induction Charging and Magnetic Levitation we got OvRcharge.
A Wireless Levitational Charger, that is not only suspend the device in the mid air and holds its altitude, but also charge and rotate it as well.



  OvRcharge stops charging the phone when battery is full but still levitate and rotate the device until it is removed.
 You can use it to charge your phone or just to float it.




 To achieve altitude and be able to charge wirelessly, phone requires a special case. that consists of two main parts, electricity receiver from the base and a Magnet to hold its position mid air. so we design ultra thin case to not only protects your investment but to go some levels and also powers it up all at same time. This case has a magnet that will help it to levitate & it also has induction receiver for charging without cables.
**We offer most popular model's cases but it is not possible at the moment to carry all types of cases, in this case we are offering third party attachment to work with your own case and supplied magnet (so generally speaking it works with all kind of phones or most of em).  
**Choice of Color and Phone model will be asked after the campaign ends
 **Incase of newer phone model arrival you just have to purchase the extra case from us & you are covered.

Robotics fans, drone pilots, hackers & data-miners - rejoice!
The BrainCard is an open source hardware platform featuring the worlds only fully functional and field-tested
Neuromorphic Chip containing 1024 silicon neurons. It is able to learn and
recognize patterns within any dataset generated by any source, from the physical (sensors), to the virtual
(data). Offered here, for the first time, to makers
in a format compatible with nearly all other popular electronics platforms — from
Raspberry Pi to Arduino and Intel Edison —  we aim to help
you add cognitive perception to any electronics project.
Add a brain to: Robots, toys or an old
GoPro. Give them the ability to recognize and recall almost anything... You can also add a brain to any digital cameras including dash
cams. Vision not your thing? The same technology can recognize patterns in data like that packet of code you're looking for in a sea of C++, a phrase in an eBook (regardless of the books length), even real time data: Build your own biosensors!  Make any appliance you like “smart”, like a coffee pot that recognizes you and starts making your coffee the way you like best. 
Simply put; make it think. 



Cannot wait for technical details?
Before we carry on, for those of you that are quick studies and/or already know everything, we thought you might like to skip straight to the specs so here you go:
 BrainCard Specifications (Hardware and API)

Now back to your
 project...

The BrainCard™ is a small electronics board with a NeuroMem® CM1K device plus a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chip to connect to platform buses and sensor inputs. There is even an optional image sensor featured on the BrainCard 1KIS (Image Sensor) version. It can be connected to almost any popular electronics platform including Arduino/Raspberry Pi/Intel Edison and enables users to massively boost any devices capability by creating a brain-like system architecture – hence the name.




The CM1K chip(s) on the BrainCard essentially acts as a right-brain hemisphere ready to learn, recognize and recall patterns/images/sounds/inputs from any incoming data stream. This allows the accompanying MPU device to concentrate on what it’s good at — left-brain functions such as logic, procedural computing and as a communications and I/O interface. 

The key to success is teaching BrainCard as you would a child: Teach it too conservatively and it will not generalize enough; too moderately and it could get confused. It is not like traditional programming and we have found that part of the fun in building projects with the BrainCard is in this new learning parameter.
It’s really quite simple: Show the BrainCard what it must recognize and assign the example a category. So: This face is John, that voice is Emma, this vibration is made by your cat purring and so on.
Getting started:
The BrainCard is delivered with a default configuration which can communicate with either one of the proposed controllers (Arduino, Raspberry PI or Edison) through a same communication protocol over their SPI lines.  Access to generic pattern learning and recognition functions using the CM1K chip are made through a simple API delivered for the different IDE (Arduino and Eclipse). More specific function libraries will be released shortly after and we hope to start a repository of your libraries too! 



Install and connect the BrainCard to the MPU/Device of your choice. View the hardware datasheet


Install the API in the IDE of your choice (Arduino, Eclipse). View the BrainCard API preliminary datasheet


Now, you can program to teach the BrainCard using examples previously collected and saved to disk (waveforms, images, movies). Or you can program some GPIOs to trigger teaching (bush buttons, keyboard inputs and even voice control! As illustrated in the following video, teaching amounts to selecting examples and sending one of more signatures of this example to the neurons of the BrainCard. The neurons will decide if the example is worth learning based on what they already know. If applicable, some neurons will autonomosuly correct themselfves if they contradict the teacher and never repeat this mistake again.

Recognition is the same as learning except that this time, your program monitors the response of the neurons to the incoming signatures instead of sending them learning commands. Your program can then act based on what is recognized using the wealth of GPIOs available through Arduino Shields, as well as  DeviceToDevice or DeviceToCloud communications, and more. 

 





So what can it do?
This is a great
question, as even we have not fully explored the full range of the
BrainCard/CM1K’s capabilities. Almost every day we are coming up with new
applications for the technology, which is one of our quandaries, and is where YOU come in. It’s also why we are
choosing to announce ourselves to the world via Indiegogo.
A simple list of known capabilities 
 





Object recognition
Using the KIS vesion or an
off-the-shelf image sensor of your own and teach your BrainCard to recognize
shapes, colors, objects, signs, people and animals.



Stereoscopic vision
With two image sensors attached, along
with a CPU, your project can work in stereoscopic vision! The processor can
triangulate distance and the CM1K can recognize what it’s looking at. Add some
motors to the image sensors and it can track things too.
 


Audio Recognition
Attach a microphone and teach the
BrainCard to recognize a noise, a voice, YOUR voice or other audio signals like
a bird song or a dog.
Vibration and motion
Attach a MEMS (Micro Electrical
Mechanical Systems) device and teach the BrainCard to recognize vibrations or
physical motion.
Bio signals
 BrainCard can
recognize data from any Bio-signal source – such as:      
Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electromyogram (EMG), Mechanomyogram (MMG), Electrooculography (EOG), Galvanic skin response (GSR), Magnetoencephalogram (MEG).
 


Text and Numbers
You can run your data through the
BrainCard in any form — from text to binary to DNA sequences — and teach it to
recognize patterns, which will allow it to detect anomalies, identify clusters
and make predictions.

There are MANY MORE applications we just haven't tried yet...
Flexibility
If you go crazy while teaching and fill all 1024 neurons on a chip, don’t panic. BrainCard provides an expansion bus to stack more CM1K chips in boards of two, thereby increasing the number of modules (subject to availability) you can teach by increments of 2048 (1x CM1K equals 1,024 neurons). This expansion can be done at any time to its maximum of 8,192  (plus the original 1024 on the BrainCard), and will not impact your teaching allowing you to experiment to your heart’s content.

The core of the NeuroMem/NeuromorThings
team has been in place for 16 years and has plenty of research and industrial
customers already using the CM1K chip, so this is not a typical “prototype”
project.
We have a full supply chain already in
place for both the board and for mounting the chips. We also have a wealth of
knowledge in developing board-level and semiconductor technologies — all of
which makes the risks to you a bare minimum. 
We just need your support to complete
prototyping/testing and to begin volume manufacturing. The first 1000 IWIN
BrainCards will have exclusive access to the technology for the three months it
takes us to make the new batch of chips. 
Once we begin mass manufacturing the BrainCard,
we will begin our long development roadmap on its successors and other
neuromorthings. 

After the first run of IWIN devices, the rest of
the time will be dedicated to mounting the chips to the boards and testing
them. With enough support we can get production runs up to very large numbers
per month very quickly.    ShippingShipping a technology product is fraught with issues like export restrictions. We've tried to make it as simple as possible and built shipping as a perk. In the US, Mexico and canada? includedRest of World? $30 Shipping & Packing Due to the technical nature of the BrainCard it can be liable to Export Restrictions in certain countries under United States Law. If you are unsure if you are effected - please contact us at: info@neuromorthings.com and put ""Export"" in the subject line and we'll do everything we can to help.   Other Ways You Can Help Can't buy a BrainCard? How about giving us a High $5? High 5'ers will all feature on the website and be written into NeuromorThings lore... it's a program for those interested in the technology and who want to help but who can't spring for their own BrainCard. 
Got no cash at all? No problem - simply SPREAD THE WORD! Tell everyone you know about us and help us that way instead, on Facebook, on Twitter - wherever. 
Every little bit helps!

Export regulations:
It might occurs, in certain rare cases that your country is under export embargo and we cannot ship because of the nature of the technology included in the BrainCard.If this exceptional situation occurs your money will be fully refunded.",4.0,6,"2 Campaigns

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why RoamYo?</span></h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>Portable phone chargers are not a new
product.</p>
<p>But the market seems to be saturated with
boring, brandless, corporate commodities and we wanted a product with a little
more life and more personality. </p>
<p>Something we would be happy to give as a gift for her or him that wouldn't look out of place
next to us on the train, on a desk, or perching on a table at a bar. We wanted
a product that could roam with us everywhere.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>

<p><br/></p></span></div>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So, as a result, Tisa Tech was created by 6 young entrepreneurs who met during a Masters course at Cass Business School and decided to create a product that we personally would want to own ourselves.</span></div>

<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>We're genuinely passionate about this product but as a young start-up trying to make our mark in a very competitive market, we really do need your help to get this product off the ground.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1305430/files/20150318090925-budget_bar.jpg?1426694965"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Your contribution will give us the start-up capital required to break those big corporate entry barriers and get RoamYo to those who want or need him.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Greater Impact</h3>
<p>It's a <a href=""http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/10/right-feel-safe-women-should-be-able-use-public-transport-without-fear"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">very real</a> and very global problem that people, especially young women, do not feel as confident as they should when out and about. Parents and friends often worry about the safety of their loved ones, especially at night.</p>

Why RoamYo?


Portable phone chargers are not a new
product.
But the market seems to be saturated with
boring, brandless, corporate commodities and we wanted a product with a little
more life and more personality. 
Something we would be happy to give as a gift for her or him that wouldn't look out of place
next to us on the train, on a desk, or perching on a table at a bar. We wanted
a product that could roam with us everywhere.





So, as a result, Tisa Tech was created by 6 young entrepreneurs who met during a Masters course at Cass Business School and decided to create a product that we personally would want to own ourselves.








 
Why We Need Your Help
We're genuinely passionate about this product but as a young start-up trying to make our mark in a very competitive market, we really do need your help to get this product off the ground.


Your contribution will give us the start-up capital required to break those big corporate entry barriers and get RoamYo to those who want or need him.

The Greater Impact
It's a very real and very global problem that people, especially young women, do not feel as confident as they should when out and about. Parents and friends often worry about the safety of their loved ones, especially at night.

       
                        
We all know that sinking feeling when you're out and suddenly in an uncomfortable situation and without a phone to call for help.
We hope the RoamYos will help give back people the confidence to roam where they please.

<p> </p>
<p>That was an short overview what iStart is and what it can be if you support this project!</p>
<p><strong>Some information about me:</strong></p>
<p>Im Kay Schneider , i worked as software developer on different companys. Based on software for the web. From Online Games to internet agencys wich build websites for large world wide operation companys.</p>
<p>In the year 2011 i was one of the top submitter on the ""google developer contest - doodle your way to gdd"".</p>
<p>After these 8 years experience i tink that it is time for something new. It is time to build an awesome software product wich is shipped mostly for free to all the people over the world. </p>
<p>And after the success i had in the google contest, where i have developed a demo for html5 fetaures with javascript, i mostly programmed at my free time in javascript. And also on work i started focus on javascript.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>installed Apps</strong>, <strong>Bookmarks/links, and information in realtime from everywhere - live tiles - cloud control - </strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/>Now i have developed ""iStart"" in an based Version</strong> wich gives the users an good userexperience. I released the Software at the end of january in 2013 after a week endless developing. After that, i released a few features so that it becomes more comfortable for the users. Im raising money to developing the features ""live tiles"", API, cloud control.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/istart-new-tab-page-in-me/lkgdlmlmcijgnglfcophfjhafiafhkae"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You can still see the base version in the chrome webstore</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>It was a success. Without all features. There are over 3000  active users. Awesome. And now I need the support of the users for developing awesome features for you! Please help and keep this project alive!</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>But to finished the work i need more time than i have. To ship iStart with all the features there is still need two months of hard work. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What we need and what you get?</h2>
<p>I need still 15k to developing iStart ready with all features and spread it to the world. The money will be used that i, Kay Schneider, can spend a fulltime development on iStart without having troubles with the billings like yet.</p>
<p>This helps me, to stay focused on the users needs and the new core features for iStart, ""live tiles"" and the API. And i need a little bit time to travel to some developer meetings to speak about iStart and the API ( that needs time and money I have time, but no money )</p>
<p>The money will be completly spend covering expenses during that time, and to spend a little bit money to build extra graphics for iStart , as well as rewards for you, our supporters.</p>
<p>If I dont reached the goal I spent so long fulltime development on iStart, as the money will it allow. But than it will take longer to bringing these cool features to life :(</p>
<p>Look at the things you will become when supporting my project :)</p>

barely-operating Laptop. I will be using this PC for years, as I will be
 upgrading as I need, but the initial cost is too big for what I can 
currently afford.<br/><br/>As you would probably be wondering, why do I 
need this money? Well, let me explain my situation,  I have been using 
computers for over 5 years, (I know this doesn't sound like a lot to 
most, but that’s 1/3rd of my life) and I don't know what I would do if I
 was unable to use one on a regular basis. My life currently revolves 
around my computer. A large majority of my closest friends are on the 
internet. If I was unable to keep in touch with these people, I would be
 a much lonelier person. Another thing I love about my computer, is how I
 am able to do what I truly love doing with my time. My favorite 
activities consist of; creating Youtube content, playing video games, 
and website development. I have been saving up for this computer for 
over 2 years, and at this rate, it won't be funded for another 3 years. 
My parents would love to help, but unfortunately, there hasn't been any 
income in my household for over 6 years. So my parents are just unable 
to help me out.<br/><br/><h4>Here's a video that I made about a Minecraft Economy:</h4><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F36AGn4S3RXk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D36AGn4S3RXk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F36AGn4S3RXk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>My current Computer:<br/><br/>Now you're 
wondering, ""Well, why do you need a New computer?"", and I do have very 
good reason. My current PC is a 7 year old Toshiba Satellite A135-S4467,
 purchased in 2008. <br/>The specs:<br/>-Intel Core 2 Duo T5200 Processor<br/>-4 GB of RAM<br/>-Intel GMZ 950 Video Card<br/>-1280 x 800 (WXGA) Display.<br/>This computer is currently available for sale on Amazon.com, for the price of $40.00 USD. <br/><br/>Now
 specs are all good and dandy, but how does it operate? Well, for an old
 laptop, pretty good, when it actually works, but that's not saying 
much. Every time I turn it on it takes around 5-7 minutes to bring up 
the desktop. Then I have to wait another 3-5 minutes for all the 
programs to start (skype, task manager, Teamspeak, etc). This is a major
 hassle every time I need to turn it on, which is daily. Now in additon,
 I also experience semi-frequent computer crashing. These can be in many
 forms, Screen locks (including mouse), Blue screen of death, or 
sometimes it will just completely shut off on its own (for no apparent 
reason, usually 1-2 times a day).<br/><br/>Now, having that old brick 
isn't cutting it anymore. As I mentioned earlier, what I love doing on 
this computer involves making videos, video games, Skype, and 
programming. Now due to my current snail-speed computer, I am barely 
able to use skype and an internet browser at the same time, let alone 
play video games, make high-quality videos, and program (effectively at 
least). My life practically revolves around my PC, and when that PC is 
as bad as mine, it is all-around annoying and aggravating. This is why I
 want a new computer.<br/><br/><br/>The New PC:<br/><br/>The new computer I 
am looking at is going to cost approximately $620, including box and

 we come to the interesting part, paying for this computer. As of

 obviously I don't expect you to just donate because I am some kid

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Computers create a lot of heat when in heavy use. Manufacturers traditionally created ways to prevent potential over-heating by cooling processors using fans to neutralize the heat generated. Project Exergy flips this concept by creating computers that are meant to run as hot as possible, and then store that heat energy for use in your home and office. It's a radical, yet simple concept - and when it gains momentum, it will be the biggest energy revolution in a generation!</span><br/></p>
</div><p></p>As of today, data centers consume 2-3 % of all electricity produced in the US. On the other hand up to 60% of energy used in American homes is the heat for hot water and living space. Combining the two together - growing computation loads and existing needs for heat - and you see the path to achieve both more efficiently.<div><br/></div><div>

<p><span>Do you know that <b>30-50% of the energy that goes into data centers is used to cool down the servers?</b> What if instead of using all that energy to keep the servers cool we focused on the heat benefits from the servers? We can achieve this if we move those servers, or rather the computation loads thy support, to places where that heat is needed, like your home or business.</span></p>

<p>This project has been so much fun - we’ve learned a whole heck of a lot and made many friends along the way. We’re very thankful for the help and support our friends (and strangers) have provided us. In particular, we’d like to send a very warm thank you to the <a href=""http://www.ccskillscenter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Clark County Skills Center</b></a> and their pre-engineering students who have helped design high temperature, custom parts for Henry. The students have also given us great feedback and tips along the way too. </p>

<p>We also have to give our friend Shaul, Daniella and the family at Dick’s Hardware in Manhattan a big thank you. He and his team have helped us find and build so many of the little and big parts and pieces we needed for the first prototype. Shaul was a little skeptical at first but I think it’s safe to say he is now one of our biggest fans. And, no Shaul - we’re still not going on the shark tank! <br/></p>

<p>A big thank you to Demian and Scott from Ryder's Alley! These two have given us free reign to use their motorcycle shop, tools and machinery to build our high temperature computer in the heart of Manhattan. As you can imagine, it’s a little tricky to find a place to turn a wrench in the city... it’s even harder to find a place to fabricate a computer powered water heater! </p>

</div></div>","Think about your computer at home - the more you use it, the hotter it get's, right? Now imagine all the computers all over the world and how much heat they generate. That heat is energy - energy that could be made useful if we just made use of it. Project Exergy is about generating heat from computers to heat and cool our homes and buildings . ""HENRY"" - the proof of conceptThis is Henry - he is a high-performance prototype computer that captures and thermally stores the heat he generates … enough heat to keep a 1000 square foot apartment warm and cozy while he crunches data to help support cancer researchers at Stanford’s Folding@Home project.Henry consistently hits the temperatures we need to make domestic hot water, space heating, and power desiccant-driven air conditioning. Built with off-the-shelf parts, he’s running at the extremes of what he can reliably do on a daily basis. DAREHENRY - the next prototypeFuture generations of “DareHenry” will be super energy efficient and energy productive by capturing and storing more than 90% of the heat generated by the internal components. DareHenry will also be modular, easy to maintain, and programmed so that we can customize its performance to suit your needs.

Computers create a lot of heat when in heavy use. Manufacturers traditionally created ways to prevent potential over-heating by cooling processors using fans to neutralize the heat generated. Project Exergy flips this concept by creating computers that are meant to run as hot as possible, and then store that heat energy for use in your home and office. It's a radical, yet simple concept - and when it gains momentum, it will be the biggest energy revolution in a generation!
As of today, data centers consume 2-3 % of all electricity produced in the US. On the other hand up to 60% of energy used in American homes is the heat for hot water and living space. Combining the two together - growing computation loads and existing needs for heat - and you see the path to achieve both more efficiently.

Our mission on IndieGoGo is to build an engaged community to support and spread the idea of exergy – energy productivity – maximizing energy and its co-benefits. Project Exergy believes some of these co-benefits are: economic productivity, resource efficiency, and adaptability.
Do you know that 30-50% of the energy that goes into data centers is used to cool down the servers? What if instead of using all that energy to keep the servers cool we focused on the heat benefits from the servers? We can achieve this if we move those servers, or rather the computation loads thy support, to places where that heat is needed, like your home or business.

Friends and Partners



 Scott and Julie at Solar Roadways have shown us that people ARE willing to vote with their dollars for the future they want to see. All the way to the White House and a mention in the President’s recent State of the Union speech is proof that the little guys can still have a big impact, thanks for being a force for change and a serious inspiration Scott and Julie! Check out this video (above) from Scott Brusaw at Solar Roadways about why we need your help!




This project has been so much fun - we’ve learned a whole heck of a lot and made many friends along the way. We’re very thankful for the help and support our friends (and strangers) have provided us. In particular, we’d like to send a very warm thank you to the Clark County Skills Center and their pre-engineering students who have helped design high temperature, custom parts for Henry. The students have also given us great feedback and tips along the way too. 






We also have to give our friend Shaul, Daniella and the family at Dick’s Hardware in Manhattan a big thank you. He and his team have helped us find and build so many of the little and big parts and pieces we needed for the first prototype. Shaul was a little skeptical at first but I think it’s safe to say he is now one of our biggest fans. And, no Shaul - we’re still not going on the shark tank! 


A big thank you to Demian and Scott from Ryder's Alley! These two have given us free reign to use their motorcycle shop, tools and machinery to build our high temperature computer in the heart of Manhattan. As you can imagine, it’s a little tricky to find a place to turn a wrench in the city... it’s even harder to find a place to fabricate a computer powered water heater!

</div></div>","Most phone charger's are boring, get lost all the time and offer zero excitement allowing the phone to easily get BORED!  
       ( This is the REAL reason they break, get lost & hate you all the time!!!)
The RoKnDoK by RustRidge-Studios is a sick wall mounted  speaker/charging dock made of plasma cut steel that sync's your favorite jam's with L.E.D. lights for any device - phone - tablet - ipod - mp3.               
Designed and built 100% here local in our northern Utah shop,    created to bring the cool experience of the rock concert to your home, office, game-room or any place you want to make cooler.  With a handful of  current designs and new ones being created now all the time,  YOU can be part of the Revolution-Of-Change for the unbearable boring charging ritual.    Break the mundane task in charging & storing your device.
       


    

I have been working with metal and wood for many years and enjoy reinventing new things out of old things. 
  
               

 
                 I am always sketching out drawings looking to create something original that has not been out there before. I really love the concert scene and wanted to bring some of the visual and sound back home with me. Combining technologies together that create that atmosphere is the ultimate goal.             
       RoKnDoK  is a unit that simply hangs on any wall close to any power outlet,  included with every unit is a set of custom cover plates that allow you to drop your power cord through the wall and come out close to the outlet so there are no tacky cords hanging down from the RoKnDoK.
     


























                
    With help from the contributors (YOU GUYS),  Our goal of having everyone enjoy and entertain with the RoKnDoK can be reached. 
Without your support, streamlining the circuit board production would take a lot more time.    We've come a long way within the last 6 months designing our product.  Engineering of the working prototype are  complete on the first 5 designs. 
Now we need your help to bring RoknDoK to the rest of the world.  By contributing to our campaign, You'll be casting your vote to how we reinvent the charging and storing of our devices so every morning you'll know where it is fully charged and ready to go.


     
          


 





Some of our initial risks include the manufacturing delays and the size of initial orders. To streamline the production of our circuit boards through local channels, without the larger quantities could increase cost which would slow production. That is why it is so important for YOUR help. 
If we run into any bumps along the way, you will be the first to know so you will be in the loop on how we will fix these problems if they arise.



               

      







           If you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help:

You can still get the word out and make some noise about our campaign by sharing through your favorite social media channels.
Also you can use the Indiegogo share tools!


We would really appreciate ANYTHING you could do to help get the word out!!

   How does TipsTree Work?


Choose a branch to categorize and add a twig for your experience, for example if you are traveling to Europe then you should choose the traveling branch and add a special twig title about your experience. 

With TipsTree, you aren't sharing an isolated experience; you are sharing the tree of your life. You can post text, images, videos- even lists, making each post as comprehensive and memorable as the experience. When your followers click on your tree, images and videos for each branch are available in your feed, as well as a unique map showing your experience locations.

Interested in another member's experience? TipsTree makes it easy to search experiences. Simply click on the map and filter by tags. You can also follow other members based on common experiences. 

You can even use TipsTree as a way to share your professional experience, using it as a CV for potential employers or clients. Businesses can also share company events or updates on their own tree. As your business grows and the people you employ and the products you develop grows; your tree grows!

 
Your contribution will help us develop an even faster website, as well as a new mobile app - so that it's even easier to document and share experiences on TipsTree.   ScreenShots

We may all experience having the same or very similar ideas, shared visions, epiphanies, in some cases dreams, and even premonitions in close proximity time wise to one another. Each of us connected, though we may be separated by thousands of miles, oceans, mountains and continents.Here is a example of the Collective Consciousness Mobile App. DisplayNow is the time:
For the first time ever, together with your help, support and participation using The Collective Consciousness mobile app.  we can measure, explore, and map our collective consciousness in realtime, on a global scale.Having measurable indisputable evidence of our collective consciousness could bring about dramatic and possibly far reaching changes in all areas of the humanities, and potentially, every other area of living.The Collective Consciousness Mobile App.Connecting our collective consciousness like never before.Be it the arts, science or technology, we all share in the larger vision, a collective consciousness. Have you ever had an idea or dream come into fruition? Have you ever made a prediction that came true? Do you feel this phenomenon now growing exponentially? You are not alone.Together using the Collective Consciousness Mobile App. we can identify, measure and map our collective consciousness in realtime on a global scale.The Goal: Connecting our collective consciousness like never before.The Objectives: Create a social media mobile app and algorithmic software. Identify, measure and map our collective consciousness.Let Your Consciousness Stream: Easily post and share your thoughts, visions, dreams, hypotheses, predictions, concepts, ideas and connect with other contributors.Each Collective Consciousness Mobile App. participant will have access to forums, groups, collected data, interviews with special guests and featured participants. The Collective Consciousness Mobile App. will collect and process bio algorithmic data created in realtime from participants input.Let's Play a Game: Random number data generated from games and puzzles played by participants will be added to input data representing sub conscious contribution. A graphic color meter will reveal a measured global collective consciousness, more detailed analysis will be separated categorically.No Membership Required: Become a basic user and remain private.Become a Member: Network with others, join and form groups. Choose to be visible to other members or remain private.Looking forward to your participation.Thank You.The Collective Consciousness Mobile App.Connecting our collective consciousness like never before.A few words about the author of this campaign.Christopher Bejole is a musician, recording artist, producer and author.How we are all connected has always been his passion.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Who is NCASE?</strong><br/><br/>We are a couple of guys with an interest in hardware and design that connected while discussing what we wanted from a small form-factor (SFF) computer case. We felt that the available cases were either too big, too limited, or too lacking in the aesthetics department. So we set out to design our own SFF case, with input from the community of hardware enthusiasts at <a href=""http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1717132"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">[H<span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">]</span>ardForum</a>. After months of R&amp;D, through numerous iterations, then a successful <a href=""http://igg.me/at/ncase-m1-prototype/x/2200611"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">prototype <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_noSuggestion GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">crowdfunding</span> campaign</a> and product testing, we've arrived: the NCASE M1 is ready for production!<br/><br/>Now is your chance to own the first ever case developed with direct community involvement - by and for the users. Your support in bringing this project into reality will help <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">show case</span> manufacturers that this kind of community-oriented development can work and result in better products.<br/><br/>If you supported us during the prototype campaign or during development, thank you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The NCASE M1<br/><br/></strong>The M1 is a mini-ITX, small form-factor case that doesn't sacrifice compact dimensions to support high-end hardware. Thanks to its innovative design, the M1 is able to support some of the most powerful PC components available, while still allowing tremendous build flexibility in a surprisingly small footprint. With its refined, understated aesthetics and quality all-aluminum construction, the NCASE M1 is the premiere choice for the discerning enthusiast.</p>
<p><br/><strong>High performance in a small footprint</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/kTBWxDa.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""M1 dimensions"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/kTBWxDal.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>In terms of performance-per-liter, the M1 surpasses every other case of its size. With support for long graphics cards (12""+) and high-performance CPU coolers, it sets a new benchmark for small form-factor cases.</p>
<p>This remarkable space efficiency is thanks to the careful arrangement of internal components: to minimize height while maintaining support for large CPU coolers, the power supply is mounted at the front, with an internal power cable routed to the rear. An opening cut in the front of the chassis allows for a graphics card to use virtually the entire length of the case, and makes installation of long cards much easier. <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">Other</span> space-saving features include the vertically-mounted slim optical drive (or <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">optionally</span>, an additional 2.5"" drive), which uses the otherwise unoccupied space behind the front panel.</p>
<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/b0QRBey.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""240mm radiator support"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/b0QRBeyl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>A standout feature is the capability to mount a dual 120mm radiator internally, providing the ultimate in high-end CPU cooling - an unprecedented feature in a case of this size, unmatched even <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">by</span> cases twice as large! This level of cooling performance has never been seen in an SFF before, and truly sets the M1 apart from other SFF cases.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The freedom to build</strong></p>
<p>Unlike most SFF cases which only allow a limited selection of configurations and components, the M1 was designed from the outset with flexibility in mind. Whether it's a multitude of drives, high-performance air cooling, or even custom water cooling, the M1 gives you the freedom to choose what's important in your build.</p>
<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/T9SA8do.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Multiple case floor mounting options"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/T9SA8dol.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>This flexibility is exemplified in the multi-use space at the bottom of the case, which has integrated mounts for up to two 120mm fans, but may also be used for a variety of combinations of 3.5"" drive, 2.5"" drives, and 80/92mm fans. There's even a third expansion slot - for fan controllers, for example, or to use a dual-slot graphics card and second expansion card (on boards that support it, e.g., Mini-DTX).</p>
<p>Another example is the multi-function side bracket that can be configured for more airflow using its dual 120mm fan mounts, or for <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">additional</span> 3.5"" hard drives with the removable drive cage.</p>
<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/h03oRxp.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Tool-less exterior panels"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/h03oRxpl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Building an SFF can often be a challenge, but the M1 makes it straightforward, thanks to the removable exterior panels. All four exterior panels - front, top, left and right - are virtually <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">toolless</span> and easily removed, while staying firmly secured when attached.</p>
<p>The versatility of the M1 is without peer in the world of SFF cases, and allows the freedom to tailor a build to a variety of tastes.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Design, refined</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/qh6FUvx.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><img alt=""Understated design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/qh6FUvxl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></a></p>
<p>Special attention was paid to the aesthetic design of the M1: from the sleek, subtly-angled front panel, to the virtual absence of visible screws - no detail was overlooked.</p>
<p>With an elegantly understated design, the M1 will appeal to those whose taste runs towards a more refined aesthetic. The brushed aluminum exterior flirts with minimalism, yet retains an identity and <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">sense</span> of purpose. Rather than detract from it, the air vents on the top and sides incorporate the needed cooling into the case in a symmetric, cohesive whole. Aside from the air vents, the simple, linear slot for the top-loading optical drive is the only other feature at the top of the case.</p>

<p><strong>Design/Compatibility Questions</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>Q: Mini-ITX boards only have one expansion slot and video cards usually only use two, so why does the case have three slots?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> To <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">accomodate</span> the following:<br/>- GPUs with triple-slot coolers<br/>- Slot mounted accessories, e.g. <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">fan</span> controllers<br/>- Mini-DTX motherboards (which allows a second card in addition to a dual slot GPU)<br/>- Drives / fans / cables (not wasted space if third slot is left unused)</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Q: Since it has three slots already, why not just add one more and make it <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">microATX</span>?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> MicroATX boards are <em>not</em> just one more slot, they are also much longer than Mini-ITX (244mm vs. 170mm). The extra space required for an <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">mATX</span> board is occupied by the power supply; changing the design to accommodate the larger board would necessitate an unacceptable increase in size (and would result in a layout very much like the Silverstone SG09).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Will the Swiftech H220 fit? Will the Corsair H100 fit? Can two closed-loop liquid coolers be installed in the case?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> The M1 is compatible with both the Swiftech H220 and Corsair H100. It's unlikely that two single 120mm closed loop coolers will fit, however</p>
<p><br/><strong>Q: What thickness of radiator will fit?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> It's best to stay with slim radiators only (i.e., under 35mm thick), though thicker <em>may</em> fit.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Can a radiator be mounted on the bottom?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> It's possible, but it's DIY territory. It would require GPU <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">watercooling</span>, a slim radiator (30mm), and slim fans.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Will a pump and/or reservoir fit inside the case?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> Depending on the parts used, it's possible to mount certain pumps and/or reservoirs internally.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Can a modular ATX power supply be used?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> A longer GPU will hit the modular plugs, so that's the limiting factor.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Q: What is the case made from?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> Anodized 1.5mm aluminum.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Q: Who will be manufacturing the case?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> Lian Li.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Will it come with fan filters?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes, filters <span class=""GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct"">are included</span>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","2014-04-19 Update: We are currently in the planning phase of a second production run.

Who is NCASE?We are a couple of guys with an interest in hardware and design that connected while discussing what we wanted from a small form-factor (SFF) computer case. We felt that the available cases were either too big, too limited, or too lacking in the aesthetics department. So we set out to design our own SFF case, with input from the community of hardware enthusiasts at [H]ardForum. After months of R&D, through numerous iterations, then a successful prototype crowdfunding campaign and product testing, we've arrived: the NCASE M1 is ready for production!Now is your chance to own the first ever case developed with direct community involvement - by and for the users. Your support in bringing this project into reality will help show case manufacturers that this kind of community-oriented development can work and result in better products.If you supported us during the prototype campaign or during development, thank you!
 
The NCASE M1The M1 is a mini-ITX, small form-factor case that doesn't sacrifice compact dimensions to support high-end hardware. Thanks to its innovative design, the M1 is able to support some of the most powerful PC components available, while still allowing tremendous build flexibility in a surprisingly small footprint. With its refined, understated aesthetics and quality all-aluminum construction, the NCASE M1 is the premiere choice for the discerning enthusiast.
High performance in a small footprint

In terms of performance-per-liter, the M1 surpasses every other case of its size. With support for long graphics cards (12""+) and high-performance CPU coolers, it sets a new benchmark for small form-factor cases.
This remarkable space efficiency is thanks to the careful arrangement of internal components: to minimize height while maintaining support for large CPU coolers, the power supply is mounted at the front, with an internal power cable routed to the rear. An opening cut in the front of the chassis allows for a graphics card to use virtually the entire length of the case, and makes installation of long cards much easier. Other space-saving features include the vertically-mounted slim optical drive (or optionally, an additional 2.5"" drive), which uses the otherwise unoccupied space behind the front panel.

A standout feature is the capability to mount a dual 120mm radiator internally, providing the ultimate in high-end CPU cooling - an unprecedented feature in a case of this size, unmatched even by cases twice as large! This level of cooling performance has never been seen in an SFF before, and truly sets the M1 apart from other SFF cases.
The freedom to build
Unlike most SFF cases which only allow a limited selection of configurations and components, the M1 was designed from the outset with flexibility in mind. Whether it's a multitude of drives, high-performance air cooling, or even custom water cooling, the M1 gives you the freedom to choose what's important in your build.

This flexibility is exemplified in the multi-use space at the bottom of the case, which has integrated mounts for up to two 120mm fans, but may also be used for a variety of combinations of 3.5"" drive, 2.5"" drives, and 80/92mm fans. There's even a third expansion slot - for fan controllers, for example, or to use a dual-slot graphics card and second expansion card (on boards that support it, e.g., Mini-DTX).
Another example is the multi-function side bracket that can be configured for more airflow using its dual 120mm fan mounts, or for additional 3.5"" hard drives with the removable drive cage.

Building an SFF can often be a challenge, but the M1 makes it straightforward, thanks to the removable exterior panels. All four exterior panels - front, top, left and right - are virtually toolless and easily removed, while staying firmly secured when attached.
The versatility of the M1 is without peer in the world of SFF cases, and allows the freedom to tailor a build to a variety of tastes.
Design, refined

Special attention was paid to the aesthetic design of the M1: from the sleek, subtly-angled front panel, to the virtual absence of visible screws - no detail was overlooked.
With an elegantly understated design, the M1 will appeal to those whose taste runs towards a more refined aesthetic. The brushed aluminum exterior flirts with minimalism, yet retains an identity and sense of purpose. Rather than detract from it, the air vents on the top and sides incorporate the needed cooling into the case in a symmetric, cohesive whole. Aside from the air vents, the simple, linear slot for the top-loading optical drive is the only other feature at the top of the case.

Size restrictions and recommendations:
CPU Cooler:

Top-down coolers are recommended.
Height restriction: 130mm
Cooler cannot extend past the top of the board by more than 10mm. For many larger coolers, this limits motherboard choice to those with centrally-located sockets.
Large coolers that extend past the front of the board will prevent the 3.5"" HDD cage from being used.

Watercooling:

Sealed liquid coolers or integrated pump/block and radiator/res recommended.
Single 120mm or 240mm radiators only.
Thinner radiators only (under 40mm).
Fans in push/pull are not recommended due to space constraints.

GPU:

Rear exhaust cards recommended.
Max length: 12.5"" (slots 1 & 2), 11"" (slot 3)
Max width: -For cards up to 11.5"" in the first or second slot: 5.5"" (4.7"" at the PCIe power connectors)-For cards up to 12.5"" or cards in the third slot: 4.4""

Power supply:

SFX up to 130mm, modular or non-modular.
ATX support via included bracket is limited to 140mm non-modular PSUs with cards longer than 200mm. ATX PSUs are not recommended due to limited room for long cables. Caution: the AC inlet orientation on some ATX power supplies may prevent the angle plug from fitting, please check carefully. See this image.

With a range of one mile, a run time of 16+ hours and a starting price of $1295. TARGETVISION is the perfect companion for long range shooters, competitive shooters, and people who are looking for a more interactive and entertaining shooting experience. This unit is able to clearly see .17 caliber bullet holes and larger at any distance up to a mile. TARGETVISION consists of two pieces, the transmitter/camera and the receiver. The transmitter sits down range about 10-15 feet from the target and can be moved within that range to adjust the field of view. The receiver is built into the carrying case and sits next to the shooter while shooting.</p><p><b>SET UP - COULD IT BE ANY EASIER?</b></p><p>TARGETVISION replaces the spotting scope and may even be easier to setup.  In three easy steps you could be up an going with your very own TARGETVISION . </p><p>1. <b>Power </b>-- Turn on the TARGETVISION camera and receiver </p><p>2. <b>Connect </b>-- Connect your phone or tablet to your TARGETVISION system’s WiFi network</p><p>3. <b>Aim </b>-- Take TARGETVISION down range with you when setting up your target and aim the camera throught the app to

With a range of one mile, a run time of 16+ hours and a starting price of $1295. TARGETVISION is the perfect companion for long range shooters, competitive shooters, and people who are looking for a more interactive and entertaining shooting experience. This unit is able to clearly see .17 caliber bullet holes and larger at any distance up to a mile. TARGETVISION consists of two pieces, the transmitter/camera and the receiver. The transmitter sits down range about 10-15 feet from the target and can be moved within that range to adjust the field of view. The receiver is built into the carrying case and sits next to the shooter while shooting.SET UP - COULD IT BE ANY EASIER?TARGETVISION replaces the spotting scope and may even be easier to setup.  In three easy steps you could be up an going with your very own TARGETVISION . 1. Power -- Turn on the TARGETVISION camera and receiver 2. Connect -- Connect your phone or tablet to your TARGETVISION system’s WiFi network3. Aim -- Take TARGETVISION down range with you when setting up your target and aim the camera throught the app to get the exact view that you want4. Enjoy -- Shoot with an ease and enjoyment you couldn’t have imagined possible! - this one doesn’t really count as a step ;)FEATURESRevolutionizing the shooting experience one feature at a timeSee your target with a clarity and ease never possible before.  Increase your trigger time and reduce the variables.  With TARGETVISION you never have to get off of your gun to see where you hit, just glance over at the screen and immediately know where you hit.Shot Recognition - Always know which shot was your last.  Shot recognition highlights and numbers each shot so you always know which shot was your most recentMultiple Users - TARGETVISION allows multiple people to log into one camera system and view the same target.  This is a great tool for training, shooting with a group, or showing off...Multiple Cameras - View multiple cameras at one time or scroll through them as you change targets or train multiple shootersSnapshot/Record - Take snapshots and record your shooting sessions to review later or share with friends.Share - Share your photos and videos through messaging, Facebook, and other social media.Group Marking - Keep track of your groups with the easy to use group marking feature.  This will color code each group of shots that you designate as you shoot.Shooting Sessions - Keep track of how you shoot each time you go to the range by creating albums that categorize your pictures and videos while allowing you to add information about where you were, how far you were shooting, and any other custom information that you would like to include.We began developing TARGETVISION almost two years ago and have come a long way since then.  We are finally ready to share our product with the world and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do.  Below you will find pictures of some of our initial prototypes.R1R2R2.1R3We are finally ready to launch our product and we need your help to do so.  We manufacture all of our units in our shop in Houston, Texas.  This has its advantages and disadvantages, but what it really means is that we don't have to raise a ridiculous amount of money to get TARGETVISION into your hands.  We have already refined our design and our manufacturing process, so if you pledge for a unit you're going to get a unit!The primary reason that we are using Indiegogo is to help raise awareness around  our launch and to help plan our first production run as accurately as possible.  You can help us with this by sharing our campaign with your friends and spreading the word through social media.We are looking forward to a great campaign and hearing your feedback about our design and product!We have developed a proprietary long range link methodology that allows us to communicate at such long distances.• How does my device connect to the system? Via WiFi, each system has a unique WiFi name that coordinates to the unit serial number.

<p><b>THE POWERQUBE STORY</b></p>
<p>In January of 2011, GENIE PRODUCTS LLC began the creative process of designing a 21st century electrical charging device geared towards personal electronic devices: tablets, smart phones, iPods™, iPads™, iTouches™ etc.  The idea was to build a power charging system that would solve multiple problems that exist with the traditional power strip.  Sounds simple, and it is, however the traditional power strip has not been updated to meet modern demands for almost 30 years.  The first prototype included a retractable power cord, a multi-tap AC plug-in, and one USB port.  </p>
<p>Through the creative process, POWERQUBE started to build significant momentum and a local design engineering firm, Advance Design LLC, was hired to evolve the original prototype.  Keeping with the original idea of a retractable cord, and additional AC plug-ins, two additional prototypes were developed.</p>
<p>Through intensive consumer testing, we have finally evolved to what we have today, the POWERQUBE.  The POWERQUBE is a revolutionary 21st century charging device that brings the power source off of the floor, and places it on the desktop, countertop, nightstand, and or kitchen counter.  No more crawling on the floor to find an available plug or power source; we have already solved a huge challenge that has never been addressed with the traditional power strip.  </p>
<p><b>WHY THE POWERQUBE?! - FEATURES AND BENEFITS OF THE POWERQUBE</b></p>
<p>Think of the current household in the United States, and in all developed countries: multiple cell phones, iPads®, iPhones®, iTouches®, iPods®, and laptop computers.  All of these devices need to be charged throughout the day and at night.  Now think about the next problem at hand, all of these chargers have very short charging cords.  The typical Apple® charging cord is less than 40 inches long, the average cell phone charging cord is less than 50 inches long, it is almost impossible to use these devices while they are charging, and you NEVER have one central charging station where you can charge all of these devices at one time.  The POWERQUBE™ is a compact device, 5 inches by 2 inches, and can easily fit into your backpack or briefcase for travel.  Incorporated in the POWERQUBE™ is an additional feature that the traditional power strip does not address: charging via USB plugs.  </p>
<p>All mobile and tablet devices in today’s world are charged via USB plugs; again simple, but not solved with the traditional power strip.  The POWERQUBE™ has three USB charging outlets, and can charge, but not limited to, all Apple®, Android®, and Samsung® devices via the USB plugs. </p>
<p><b>PROVEN CONSUMER MARKET RESEARCH IN WORLDWIDE</b> </p>
<p>Global Consumer Market research has been conducted with the POWERQUBE.  The functionality, practical application, and cosmetic appeal of the POWERQUBE have all been received exceptionally well.  POWERQUBE units have ALREADY been pre-sold in 12 countries across the world.  Demographics range from 14 to 79, with 58% male and 42% female.  Over 2,000 consumers worldwide have been surveyed.  Consumers worldwide have stated that the POWERQUBE meets demands that have never been addressed and that they have been seeking to solve for years.  POWERQUBE has been tested and proved in both concept and design worldwide.</p>
<p><b>POWERQUBE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENT PROTECTION</b></p>
<p>The experienced Indianapolis based law firm of Brannon &amp; Robinson has been retained to ensure POWERQUBE™ intellectual property and patent protection worldwide, including China, Hong Kong, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Singapore, UAE and the EU.  Multiple patents have been filed for both design and utility for the POWERQUBE™, as there is tremendous value within the intellectual property that has been developed.  </p>
<p>A custom power supply and power conversion board have been configured and built exclusively for the POWERQUBE™. Patents have been filed for both board configurations as well. The POWERQUBE™ name and logo are being trademarked worldwide.  Trademark applications have been filed in all countries China, Hong Kong, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Singapore, UAE and the EU.    </p>

<p><b>Size matters</b>:</p>
<p>the Uncia can print layers as thin as 100 microns (0.004 in)
in a build volume of 102 x 77 x 180 mm (4.02 x 3.03 x 7.09 in). This means you
can print complex geometries with the exquisite details and beautiful surface
finish that will make your creations stand out.</p>
<p><b>Speed:</b></p>
<p>Whether you're rapid prototyping or simply impatient by
nature, speed is king. Using DLP technology and specially formulated materials,
Uncia can hardens an entire 0.1 mm layer all at once, without the typical

<p><b>Resolution:</b></p>
<p>Uncia can print layer heights at 100 microns , but
adjustable from 150 microns all the way down to<b> 50 microns</b>. This leads
to impressive results.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/318169/files/20140119175838-DdsfSC_61216343.jpg?1390183118"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Here’s the comparison of 3D printed products by FDM (in

<p><b>Hardware:</b></p>
<p>For most designers, the extruded plastic (i.e. FDM) of
low-end printers is simply not capable of the high resolution and quality
surface finish necessary for professional work. So, we decided to go straight for
the real deal: a stereo-lithography printer with DLP technology we call the
Uncia.</p>
<p>Stereolithography (SL) is the gold standard for accuracy
and resolution in the 3D printing world, reaching layer thicknesses and feature
sizes that are worlds ahead of what is possible with FDM, and DLP technology is
based on SL but has many more advantages. The process is pretty straightforward
- a DLP projector is used to draw on the surface of a liquid plastic resin that
hardens when exposed to a certain wavelength of light. The light draws and
hardens a layer at a time until the entire model is built. It’s simple,
reliable, and quiet.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330016/files/20140119180800-K__U5K_H9E05_H_SLLBNW7H.jpg?1390722659"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>After a great deal of research, engineering, and

<p>A
funding campaign was held for the Ovrvision 1 on Indiegogo last year as the first
dedicated VR stereo camera in the world.</p>
<p>The
targeted amount of funding could not be reached at that time, but being strongly
supported by all of you, we were able to deliver more than 1,000 units to 21
countries all over the world, and the number of shipped units as of February
2015 far exceeded the original reservation of 72 units.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
received various requests during sales of the Ovrvision 1.</p>
<p>In
addition to use for VR, applications we never imagined included medical
wearable devices, robots, architectural simulations, onboard purposes and many
others.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At
the same time we have frequently received requests for increased specs. Because
the current design of the Ovrvision 1 does not have any potential for increased
specs or extensibility, we have decided to produce the Ovrvision Pro.</p>
<p>The
Ovrvision Pro will be developed into a high-performance stereo camera that reflects
your opinions and requests.</p>

All
the source code for the demo application will be disclosed in the reference
pages.You can start development work right out of the box by downloading the
SDK.








A
funding campaign was held for the Ovrvision 1 on Indiegogo last year as the first
dedicated VR stereo camera in the world.
The
targeted amount of funding could not be reached at that time, but being strongly
supported by all of you, we were able to deliver more than 1,000 units to 21
countries all over the world, and the number of shipped units as of February
2015 far exceeded the original reservation of 72 units.


We
received various requests during sales of the Ovrvision 1.
In
addition to use for VR, applications we never imagined included medical
wearable devices, robots, architectural simulations, onboard purposes and many
others.

At
the same time we have frequently received requests for increased specs. Because
the current design of the Ovrvision 1 does not have any potential for increased
specs or extensibility, we have decided to produce the Ovrvision Pro.
The
Ovrvision Pro will be developed into a high-performance stereo camera that reflects
your opinions and requests.

Risks and challenges
Downsizing
is not very difficult, but to avoid noise caused by the wiring layout, a geometry
change may take place in the range of influence from infrared rays.
The
design will be finalized in the beginning of June.

And the electronics supplier, they would help us to improve our electronics design, in that case, droPrinter could past the test and approved by various independent agencies. Besides, they also could help us to choose the good quality battery for droPrinter.Choice of Shipment:We also have do a lot of research of international shipping. Because when we search the shipping issue in Indiegogo campus, lots of people got stuck in this step. But we have already made a plan about shipping.For example, we ship a large bulk of droPrinters to EU third party warehouse,and the staff of warehouse would resend the stock by domestic delivery. Then it could make the shipping more accuracy and safety. We have contact many warehouse and ask for a good price. So we need to ship many droPrinters, otherwise, this method is more expensive than express.Anyway, we would try our best to control the risk, and make every thing settle down. Of course, we promise to keep you updated every step of the way!This is about getting the best possible droPrinter into your hands ASAP. So please go back to the top of the page and pledge now.Thanks!",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

Initially, we thought this would be easy to accomplish, but over the last few months, we learned how hard it was to make a magnetic cable that is minimalistic, stable and durable. That’s why you see that other magnetic cables for 87W MacBook Pro on the market are often bulky. In order to make Vinpok Bolt tiny yet functional, we used miniature components to create its incredibly small size of the tip only with 8.8mm. Every component has been highly integrated into and optimized with the design. After multiple rounds of designing and prototyping, we were capable of creating the Vinpok Bolt.  We wanted to share our creation with everyone out there.There is still a lot of work to be done in manufacturing this magnetic cable, but we couldn't be more happy with how our prototypes have turned out. Your strong support will give us the needed affirmation to place a larger component order and start mass production. With your support, we can bring the Bolt to new MacBook users worldwide. Your contribution will help to fund:- Mass production tooling- Necessary components preparationThe Bolt that you see in the above videos is a real, working prototype that operates the same as the final mass production product unit. We have confidence in delivering the best Bolt as promised.Help us by Sharing Bolt with Your Friends FAQWill Bolt support my device?Bolt is a USB-C magnetic cable. It’s compatible with USB-C devices like MacBook Pro 15-inch, MacBook Pro 13-inch, MacBook 12-inch, Samsung S8, Sony Xperia X, Google Pixel/Pixel XL, LG G5, Moto Z, Huawei P9/P10, HTC 10, Xiaomi Mi 6S, Lumia 950/ 950 XL, Samsung Galaxy Book, Googlebook Pixel, HP Spectre360/13, Lenovo ThinkPad, Huawei MateBook, Dell XPS etc.Does Bolt support data transfer?No, Bolt doesn’t support data synchronization.Will Bolt support my phone case?Most major branded cases made according to USB-C specs should be fully compatible with our cable. Given the vast amount of cases available in the market, we cannot possibly test every single case in the market. We are confident that our cable should be compatible with most of the mainstream cases.What’s the shipping cost?Vinpok offers free shipping for all U.S.A orders. If you reside outside of USA, it’ll cost you US$3 for worldwide shipping.When will you ship the item? You’ll find your estimated shipping time via View Order Details. To do that, please login to your Indiegogo account and click your name at the top right of the page. In the menu that drops down, choose My Contributions, then click on View Order Details. You'll now see all of the details of this contributionHow will my order be shipped?We will use different couriers or services to ship Bolt to you depending on where you are. Each order will have a shipping notification and tracking information. Due to the changes in courier regulations on magnetic products, our shipping methods are subjected to change.Do I have to pay VAT and duty?For backers living in countries with import duties and taxes, these costs will have to be covered by the backers at delivery. We'll try our best to avoid duty and VAT. However, we cannot reassure that you won't pay VAT and duty. Remote area shipping cost.Shipping costs do NOT include extra costs that may incur for shipment to areas defined by DHL as remote. Customers may check here: http://raslist.dhl.com/jsp/first.jsp with your city’s postal code (make sure you use your city’s postal code, otherwise, it will not be accurate)Some reminders that you should pay attention to:
Please DO NOT connect and detach Bolt cable repeatedly in a short time period as this could cause damage to the cable.
Please TURN OFF power adapter first before switching/converting Bolt cable from LAPTOP to smartphone, or the rapid voltage and current changes might break down your phone.
Bolt is the world’s first magnetic cable that fully supports 87W USB-C power adapter charging for 15-inch MacBook Pro and any other USB-C devices. In order to have a better user experience and quality assurance, we also recommend you to use the original power adapter that comes with your devices.",50.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Shipping since mid-2014, the Matter and Form 3D Scanner is available throughout the world and is the #1 consumer rated 3D scanner under $3,000. 
Matter and Form  Inc. (formerly Matterform) was founded by designers and programmers who needed a high-res 3D scanner but couldn’t afford it. So we built one. With your help, we launched a record-breaking Indiegogo campaign in 2013 and were backed by designers, archivists, architects, hobbyists, gamers, teachers and creative families worldwide. 


Combining superior performance with intuitive usability, the Matter and Form 3D Scanner is an affordable, high resolution 3D scanner that is compact, portable, fully assembled and easy to use right out of the box. At the heart of our patented technology is an HD camera that produces accurate, detailed color scans at resolution qualities that match or top what more expensive scanners can achieve. It works with almost any 3D printer or online printing service, and it allows users to scan solid items to create a digital 3D model. It is also capable of producing intricate, high-resolution, 3D representations.
We’ve been developing the 3D scanner hardware and software from scratch since 2012 and will continue to provide free software updates to all users. What's more, the scanner is compatible with both Windows (7+) and Mac (OS 10.9+) and saves/exports the following file formats: STL, OBJ, PLY, XYZ and PTX. Who Currently Uses the Matter and Form 3D Scanner?

Who We Are.Drew Cox (CEO):  I've been an entrepreneur since I was 18, and making things since I could move my hands. The many jobs I have had over the years are what make me who I am.

<h3>Hello</h3>
<p>My name is Brandon Nadeau and I'm currently living in Bali with my beautiful wife, our four rescue dogs, and one rescue cat. We came to Bali to have more time to pursue our creative passions and to try and make a living doing what we love.</p>
<p>My wife, Shayna, is an amazing digital designer and photographer and the majority of her work is done online. She uses mostly illustrator and photoshop for her work, but her 6 year old Macbook has decided to stop working right at this crucial time where she is building her brand.</p>
<p>It is her birthday in two months, and I know she would be blown away if I could surprise her with a new Macbook Pro for her business. I wish I could say I could afford this on my own and give her everything she deserves, but unfortunately that's just not the reality of our financial situation.</p>
<p>By contributing to this, not only will you be helping me surprise my wife, but more importantly your contribution will help keep the entrepreneurial dream alive, and confirm to us that it is not a mistake to follow your passions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
For my surprise to be a success,  I need to raise <strong> $1500</strong> to buy a <strong>new</strong> <strong>13 inch Macbook Pro</strong> and enough to cover the <strong>9 % fee for indiegogo.</strong>
</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>The Total to cover these two expenses would be : $1,635 <br/></strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>I hope to get this by her 28th birthday on April 4th, 2013.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Now on to the good stuff: What you Get. </strong>I know my wife, and anyone who contributes, no matter what the amount, will get a personalised thank you note from her. Depending on what you contribute the other perks are professional photographs from our travels in Asia, Photo Calendars, Large Canvas prints of my wife's photos, proffesional photo editing, custom digital designs, custom logos, custom headers for websites, and custom Facebook timeline designs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anything above and beyond the amount mentioned will go to building a much needed professional website for my wife.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anything less then our goal would go to a down payment on a Macbook Pro and then we would attempt to get financing on it to pay the rest over time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe in having the courage to follow one's dreams, and I beleive in my wife, as a designer, a photographer, and as an amazingly caring human being. By contributing to this, my wife will be able to at least have a shot at her entrepreneurial dreams, and her dreams won't be crushed by the lack of a working computer.Not only will this money help her with her design and animal photography business, but it will allow her to continue her work with the animal shelter, BARC, here in Bali.</p>
<p>At BARC, she does photo shoots with the animals to improve their adoption rates,and she helps them shoot animal photos for their new fundraising campaigns. By contributing to this cause, my wife will be able to continue the work with animals she feels so passionately about.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that not everyone is in a position to contribute monetarily at this time, but if you believe in my cause and would like to suppport my wife's small business you can:</p>
<p> 1.    <strong>Leave a Happy Birthday message</strong> in the comments section of this campaign and show your love that way. <strong><br/></strong></p>

reads in my resume. I did design computers using CAD tools on a workstation I had soldered together from integrated circuits obtained from the black market. When my 11 years old son asked me: ""Dad, can we make a computer?"" I realized that it has been maybe over 20 years since I designed and made a computer.

Why? What excuses can I possible have to
not build a computer with my son, for him and other children and all of us who

Because electronics and computers are not

Because nobody understands electronics and

Because? No, there is no excuse. 
I must do it!
This was the birth of DADSON-1
But what if I not only design one computer but write a book about how it was done?
So I started to write the book and started to design a computer - from scratch using the latest and greatest technologies available today. I am writing down the process of making the computer, the design choices and design methods. From the idea to working prototype all steps will be described.

What We Need & What You Get

I am launching the campaign for one reason - to pay for the prototype production costs in a way that makes me eager to finish the book and make it available to all readers in the world.
To be honest, I could use ""household"" budget or funding from single commercial investor, in both those cases my interest to ""share"" the design process in final book form would be small. But if the funding comes from the crowd - I would feel delighted to share it. To show that designing and building computers is possible to everyone even more today than it was twenty years ago.
If the funding goal is not reached, I will still finish the book and most likely also be able to build the prototypes. With less funding it will just take more time.

The Impact

I sincerely hope that there will be some kid around the globe who takes the book and says to his dad: look we can build a computer if we want, see read here..
Look they did it, they really did, why cant we? 
And if there will be at least one new computer DESIGNED by someone somewhere then I think its already a very good achievement.
What is most exciting, designing computers is possible with zero investment, you can do it all using free tools, you just have to know it is possible.
Today my son is dreaming of ""surprising NASA"" he twiddles around with some ideas how to build ""micro rockets"" that would be able to take small loads to the orbit. I think his current concept is a model airplane that uses atmosphere thermal flow to get as much altitude as possible with least fuel used. This airplane carries an ""shuttle"" like second stage.

<p><b>FAQ:</b></p>
<p><b>Q.: How do we know where the project is ?</b><br/>
- Just as before on my facebook page I give all information about the exact
situation at the time. Even about what I'm buying that week, things like that.</p>
<p><b>Q.: Why is it inexpensive ? Other shifters are more
expensive ?</b><br/>
- To me it was important and major for the shifter to be given for a good,
available price. At the beginning the cost of the parts were 75 Euro-t, I already
decreased this. Moreover only because I do this by myself I'm satisfied with a
smaller profit. Besides this it's only the introductory price because soon I'll
have employees and I want to give them an acceptable salary. So the price of the
shifter will increase 50-70%. </p>
<p><b>Q.: How much duty is there ?</b><br/>
- I don't have a lot of information about this because it's different on every
country. Inside the EU, there is no duty. Although outside the EU there is
duty, I would ask everyone to check how much the duty is in their country and
share it. </p>
<p><b>Q.: Does it work with every game ?</b><br/>
- Those which support separated shifter, those games can work with it.
Specifically where you can set all the speeds.</p>
<p><b>Q.: If I don't have a clutch pedal can I still use the
shifter ?</b><br/>
- Yes but it's better if you have a clutch. 
Because for ex.: Assetto Corsa is not very indulgent, without it
shifting is a bit complicated but not impossible.</p>
<p><b>Q.: Does it only work with a computer or it works with a
console too?</b><br/>
- The shifter only works with a computer.</p>
<p><b>Q.: How long is the USB cable?</b><br/>
-1,8m long.</p>
<p><b>Q.: If it falls off the table/desk can it break?</b><br/>
- Once I threw down the prototype from the 5. floor and nothing happened to it.
So most likely there will be nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p><b>Q.: If I accidentally pour water in it what should you do ?</b><br/>
-In this case I'll send the back plate to you. Which has all the electronics on
its back  (The change of this is 5 Euro)</p>
<p><b>Q.: What happens if I don't like the shifter and I want to
send it back ?</b><br/>
- I can't buy it back because I gave it as a gift for the funds, for the
support in exchange.</p>
<p><b>Q.: Do the LED's always light or you can turn it off?</b><br/>
- There is a switch for this on the back.</p>
<p><b>Q.: Is the shifter dangerous ? Do I recommend it for
kids/children?</b><br/>
- I consider the shifter dangerous, it has small moving parts so you should be
careful with it. DO NOT LET CHILDREN OR KIDS USE IT WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF AN
ADULT<br/>
It's rather made for teens or adults than kids!<br/>
IMPORTANT, this is a metal device , it's not dangerous by normal use, but it's recommended to store it safely. (take it off the desk after us).<br/>
You should also be careful with the temperature. You shouldn't keep the shifter
in a place where the temperature is boiling or frosty. </p>
<p><b>Q.: Can I disassemble it ?</b><br/>
- Yes, you can because it's a homemade device but I can't take responsibility
if you don't put it together correctly. Every part has it's own place. The
changing of these could even ruin the shifter.</p>
<p><b>Q.: After a lot of use can it wear out ?</b><br/>
- Sometimes it's useful to daub the parts where the moving parts are at. It's
going to take a long time for the shifter to wear out but after a while it can
get stuck but in that case you just have to grease it.</p>
<p><b>Q.: So you have to maintain it like a car ?</b><br/>
- The secret of the longevity is the maintaining. You should keep it clean.</p>
<p><b>Q.: Can I get an electrocution while I take the shifter
apart when it's plugged in ?</b><br/>
- No because it only works with 5V, but still pay attention to not touch
the inside of it and don't take it apart under power.</p>

It does not contain glued, welded pieces.It sounds good, doesn't it?Moreover the feeling of shifting is the best as possible.Little castors are rapped around the gear stick so you can feel it perfectly when you put it in gear.-Dimensions 105mm x 280mm x 165mm Weight: 1350g-Driver is not required, plug it in USB port 2.0/3.0 and it works.-It works with almost all the operating systems.  (Tested with 32/64bit Microsoft Windows OS) -It has 6 speeds and a reverse. (I don't know any cars with manual shifter in it that has more speeds but if any exists it must me very  rare.)-The knob is duroplast ball (d=45mm) It can be taken off any time and changed into an conversial shifter knobs for cars.-It works with every known Simulator Software, and it was tested with them.(Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, IRacing, Raceroom, rFactor, Dirt Rally, etc...)How to set it?- Turn on the automatic natural speed ()- Set the 7 gears in game.- And Play! :)Negative facts:I checked the prototypes and I found some negative facts about them. -  IT'S LOUD!This is a fact. It's loud because the parts are made of metal. Only testers said this is a negative thing, to me it's not very because I like to hear when I switch. DTM's or  Rally's  shifters have sounds too.- In natural it's kind of loose. I will change this soon, because it really wobbles.- The fixing is not that pretty, but it's very strong. It has 2 steel retainers, these are unbreakable. The shifter is chargeable, it can even take the excessive force also.- The fitting of the covers is not exact. This is only an inaccuracy on the prototypes. After it they are made of a curved plate and the top and bottom edges are made of one piece of molded plastic.Perks Details:People who support me with a 100 or 115€ or more will get a H's P Standard or H'sP Modding H-shifter.Who support me with less, I'll add their name to my website which is under preparation.What happens if I won't have that much money:If I don't achieve my goal I will not be disappointed, I'll still send the perks to each and everyone of you. To me there will be only a few hurdles and obstacles if I can't reach enough money, I'll reach my goals later, and I'll have to buy things one at a time.Hurdles:My biggest problem is the manufacturing because I don't have capacity for buying the parts of it.

The LCD displays greatly impact our eyes and overall health. Bright light and screen flash can cause dry eyes, inflammation, nearsightedness, dizziness and headache, which is called Computer Vision Syndrome. We urgently need a paper-like monitor to save our eyes.DASUNG’s E-ink monitor has retina display, high contrast, fine quality, no flashing and no glare. It’s the perfect eye-saver.Unlike emissive display like LCD where backlight is projected toward your eyes, E-ink display reflects ambient light from the environment. Therefore, E-ink feels much like real ink and paper eliminating eyestrain and glare.  We are DASUNGThe Inventor of E-ink MonitorDASUNG is an innovative group founded in March 2014 by science fiction writer Dong Gong, Dr. Ray Chen, and Hiro Gong. Our team members come from China Aerospace Corporation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, MIT, Belarusian State University, and other top academies.In the last 5 years, DASUNG has developed and launched multiple generations of Paperlike E-ink Monitor that users in 70 countries can’t live without. And we never stop innovating!

</div><div>Ziro is a powerful tool for makers and tinkerers of all ages to quickly prototype their ideas. They can combine it with their custom 3D printed designs and program Ziro to experiment in robotics, home automation and other pet projects. The development kit would support Arduino and give makers full control and access to the power of the smart modules, each having a powerful microcontroller, motor and capable of hosting it’s own WiFi hotspot. With Ziro, making connected gizmos, smart robots, and other pet projects has never been easier.</div><div>

This led to the idea of creating a hand controlled modular robotics kit. By early January 2014 we created the FDM prototypes. These were basic 3D printed prototypes that were a proof of concept.

<div>Finally after Jan 2015, Ziro went under complete transformation. We started developing the kit as a product with the intention to commercialize it. This involved evolving our research prototype into actual product users will love! The modules then went through a Industrial Design cycle where we paid special attention to aesthetics and functionality of the design. All the off-the shelf electronics were converted into a small 2cmX5cm PCB. Thereby redefining the design and form factor of the module. The current state of module design constantly evolved over 2.5 years.</div>

</div><h2>Winner Announced!</h2><div>The winner is Rhonda P! We'll reach out to you directly to coordinate sending you your free Ziro! If you didn't win, you can still take advantage of our VIP discounts today!</div></div>","Ziro lets you design, build, and animate your robotic inventions, control them easily with the lift of a finger or a flick of the wrist. Made for robotics enthusiasts and creative newbies alike, Ziro is the perfect platform for bringing your 3D creations to life.








Upon receiving Ziro, you’ll have your creations brought to life within minutes. You can make your own hand-controlled toys - a fun trike with the starter kit or a really cool rover and a trike with the pro kit right out of the box.



    




Once you get the hang of making rover and trike with Ziro, you can expand your creative skills with a rich variety of pre-made toy kits from ZeroUI. You will be able to choose from toy kits made out of variety of materials such as plastic or cardboard etc. To get a taste of this, choose our Creator Bundle Perk to get pre-made cardboard kits to make humanoid robot and robotic dog.
       





Feeling more adventurous? Ziro is the perfect thing for you. Make your own designs or download them from our wide repository of designs at ZeroUI website and build your own 3D printed or cardboard cutouts right at home. You could even repurpose old toys to bring them to life. After all, Ziro is the perfect companion for those curious makers.
       





CHILDREN/STUDENTSWhen making and playing with Ziro, students learn the fundamentals of robotics, engineering, physics, and design.
Education has become so hyper focused on results that it no longer cares about the process and the experience of learning. Students should be in a safe environment where they can make mistakes and learn.We believe in the concept of failing forward, where failing should be seen as a part of success. Failures are opportunities for creative problem-solving, reflection, innovation, and growth.





MAKERS & TINKERERS
Ziro is a powerful tool for makers and tinkerers of all ages to quickly prototype their ideas. They can combine it with their custom 3D printed designs and program Ziro to experiment in robotics, home automation and other pet projects. The development kit would support Arduino and give makers full control and access to the power of the smart modules, each having a powerful microcontroller, motor and capable of hosting it’s own WiFi hotspot. With Ziro, making connected gizmos, smart robots, and other pet projects has never been easier.






Ziro is a robotics kit that let's you build robots that you can control using your hand. It's simple, fun, engaging and anyone can use it. 

Ziro is modular and untethered, made up of individual wireless motors that are controlled by a wireless connected smart glove. Ziro can be expanded to included up to 8 modules.

















Get started using our pre-made kits or assemble your own personal designs. Ziro’s modular design enables free-form robotics construction, allowing you to build virtually anything. 


Ziro enables building robots using non-plastic and eco-friendly materials such as cardboard boxes. Put your Amazon boxes to good use!











ATTACH THE MOTOR MODULES
Motor Modules can be animated in a hinge or 360º rotational movement, adding versatile dynamic movement to your robot. These modules are wireless, so they can be placed anywhere you want!! Attach your modules to your designs and see your creations come to life. You can even use them with 3D printed designs, store-bought toys, or virtually anything that you want to bring to life.













CONFIGURE WITH ZIRO'S SMART PHONE APP

Use the smartphone app to configure the motor modules using the pre-made programming templates or input your own custom commands.
Use Ziro’s free smartphone app to pair hand gestures to the movement of each module. Once connected, your smart glove movements will animate the modules.
 







CONTROL WITH SMART GLOVE

Animate your robot using hand gestures synced to the smart gloves, no coding necessary. Control your creations wirelessly using the Ziro smart glove. Your hand gestures send commands to the modules so that when you move, they move.






























Ziro's story begins in the fall of 2013, when we sat down and ideated on how to control physical objects with your hand gestures. This led to the idea of creating a hand controlled modular robotics kit. By early January 2014 we created the FDM prototypes. These were basic 3D printed prototypes that were a proof of concept. We created 8 of them. The electronics inside were all off the shelf components, which we hand soldered and packaged in big black box.





We wanted to explore more with the electronics so we 3D printed 
another set of modules and fitted with new electronics. We also improved
 our firmware which was now faster and efficient. Later we conducted 
studies among 150 users to evaluate the new kit. Thus by Jan 2015, we 
completed the development of our second batch of prototypes. We got them
 SLA printed to get a better sense of the mechanical stability of each 
module.







Finally after Jan 2015, Ziro went under complete transformation. We started developing the kit as a product with the intention to commercialize it. This involved evolving our research prototype into actual product users will love! The modules then went through a Industrial Design cycle where we paid special attention to aesthetics and functionality of the design. All the off-the shelf electronics were converted into a small 2cmX5cm PCB. Thereby redefining the design and form factor of the module. The current state of module design constantly evolved over 2.5 years.






The glove went through a similar design cycle over 2.5 years. When we started out, we got a winter glove from Supermart, tore it open and slid in our sensors. We then printed a casing of the same FDM material and prepared a large box which housed all the electronics. This box sat on the top of the hand and housed all our hand soldered electronics.

We later conducted studies with this glove and tested our system out with 150 users. By Jan 2015 we finalized our firmware and system architecture. 

Finally after Jan 2015, we got a fashion designer to help us with the ergonomic and aesthetic design of the glove. She came up with around 60 design options from which we selected the current one which we loved! In parallel we were woking on shrinking the electronics from the big box into a small 5cmX7cm PCB. The glove we have right now has electronics which is barely noticeable. Finally Ziro glove was ready for prime time! 
We paid special attention to the color scheme of the kit. Our learning sciences advisor gave us expert advice on green and white combination as it is a very gender-neutral scheme. It appeals equally to both boys and girls. Also this color scheme projects more energy to the user.

Novo is an innovative audio accessory that adjusts your headphone volume
based on the ambient noise around you to create optimal listening experiences. You don’t need
to touch the volume button on your phone. Novo will be your personal volume assistant, adapting the volume for you automatically.  With Novo, no more volume
issues.
Novo clips
to your clothing and then monitors your surroundings. It adapts your audio
in real-time by either boosting or reducing the volume to give you the best
listening experience so that you can hear what you need to hear, when you need to hear
it, without needing to touch your phone.




Novo uses patented Adaptive Audio Technology™ to automatically monitor and adjust your volume based on your surroundings.  With its state-of-the-art MEMs microphone, integrated with its hardware platform synced with software algorithms, Novo listens to your environment and adapts your audio in real-time, to ensure bettering hearing quality. 
Novo improves your hearing by either boosting or reducing your volume to provide an optimal listening experience. 







In “boost
mode,” Novo will increase your call volume when
noises interfere so you can hear the person you are talking with loud and
clear. For example, if you are outside on a phone call and passing traffic makes it difficult to understand the person on the call, Novo will boost your volume to make it easier to hear.






In “reduce mode,” you can enjoy
listening to your favorite music in the office and if a workmate needs your attention
and calls your name, Novo will
“reduce” the volume of your music in real-time so you can hear the person trying
to talk with you.
This mode is especially helpful when you are outside being active and
need to be aware of your surroundings to keep alert and safe.



What You Get & How It Works


Novo connects to any
iPhone, Android, mobile phone, MP3 or tablet with a standard 3.5 mm audio jack
and uses two standard Type 13 batteries, providing over 200 hours of operation or
approximately six weeks of use. 
 
Novo also features an adjustable slider that
allows you to personalize the microphone sensitivity to best suit your
preferences along with a metal clip that attaches to your pocket, waist, or
shirt. 






Novo functions on the device are simple. Here is a diagram to explain all:

</div></div>","Update: 
We are now shipping the new version of inCharge, with stronger magnets and higher quality connectors and components. Orders will be processed  and shipped within 5 business days.

Hey there!
 



Hi guys, we are Lorenzo and Carlo. We are brothers and we study engineering at Politecnico di Milano, in Italy. 
After experiencing frustration with the battery life of our smartphones, we decided to do something: create the most compact charging cable, to be always carried along. We are now part of Indiegogo's InDemand program, this means that you can still order from our campaign. Your order will be shipped within 5 business days. 48h after your order, you will receive an email to select the colors/connectors.
What is inCharge?
It's a very simple product, yet so useful that we believe everybody should own one. That's why one of our main goals was to keep it affordable.
There are already solutions such as power cases and extra batteries, but they are either not portable enough or easy to forget.


Because size matters.  

Thanks to its magnetic closure, you can snap it onto your keyring and carry it with you everyday.


Thanks to its flexibility, you can comfortably use your phone while on charge.


inCharge is colorful. Pick your favorite between 9 colors!



inCharge is available with both lightning connector and microUsb, so it's compatible with most of the devices out there.

Lightning connector. Works with every new generation iPhone, iPad and iPod with a Lightning connector. 
Lightning compatibility list
Micro USB. Works with every smartphone and tablet with a standard micro USB connector. 
MicroUsb phones compatibility list 
inCharge Type-C
We are currently working on inCharge with type-c connector. To stay tuned and get notified when available, please visit this link: incharge.rocks/c
Dimensions
We are serious when we say it's the most compact cable around!




Our competitors are almost double the size and triple the price!

 phones are everywhere - in February 2012, there were over 5 billion 
active mobile phone accounts.  Globally, nearly everyone carries a 
mobile phone almost all the time and these ubiquitous devices are great 
tools for getting help when you’re lost or trying to resolve infrequent 
but critical events like a car accident or an injury.  However, 
accidents on the road or on trails often occur in locations without cell
 phone reception, and the economics of improving signal coverage are 
such that wilderness areas and a huge fraction of roads will have 
massive coverage gaps for decades to come.  An estimated <a href=""http://dots911.blogspot.com/2014/01/lost-without-signal-far-more-common.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">100,000 people die each year because they need help in remote areas and can't make a call</a>.</p><p>When you're stuck in 
one of these no-coverage areas and need help, our iOS and Android signal
 finder app will lead you back to the nearest signal.  Our Signal 
Enhancer hardware will amplify whatever signal you do have, often making
 the difference between having no useable service nearby and being able 
to instantly make a call.</p><p></p><p>
</p><h1><b>Why you need the DOTS911 app:</b></h1>
<p> 1. For
everyday use to <b>record a dot where your
car is parked</b> and then get back to it easily.</p>
<p></p><p> 2. For recording dot breadcrumbs to<b>
retrace your exact path back to your hotel or the start of your hike, ride, hunt, or car journey.</b>  So you don’t have to depend on the kindness of
strangers.</p><p>3. In an emergency or not, DOTS911 will<b> lead you to a usable cell signal</b>.<br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FbLdvQxGdowE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbLdvQxGdowE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FbLdvQxGdowE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>The above video shows a first time user following the DOTS911 app to retrace her steps in order to get out of a wilderness area with no trails.</i></span><br/><p></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 36px; line-height: 40px;"">Why you need the Signal Enhancer: </b></p>

<p></p><p> 1.
To get a <b>better signal

DOTS911 phone

it as a hot spot to provide internet service to all your devices.</p><p>2. To <b>provide improved signal strength in emergencies</b>.  This allows your phone to work in many places where otherwise there is no
usable signal.  When your car is broken down or you're on a hike, the Signal Enhancer can amplify a weak signal thereby increasing the likelihood of being able to call for
help when otherwise you'd be stuck without any phone service.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FSGIF8cCXMjU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSGIF8cCXMjU&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FSGIF8cCXMjU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><i>The above video shows a demonstration in which a call is made from a ""red dot"" location with no usable phone signal in<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> Big Basin, CA.</span></i><p></p><p></p><h1>DOTS911 is insurance against getting stranded without mobile coverage.</h1><p>When
 an accident happens and you have no mobile signal, the lifeline in your
 pocket becomes no more useful than a brick.  Unfortunately, when you 
don't have reception, there's no easy way to tell where or how to find 
it.  Tragic stories based on this conundrum frequently make headlines, 
with stranded hikers or motorists unable to find help despite being 
close to a location with good phone reception.  That reception isn't 
useful to them because it’s invisible.
See some examples in our video below: </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FQjSx_uhbJAU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQjSx_uhbJAU&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FQjSx_uhbJAU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><i>The above video shows real life examples of people who could have benefited from the DOTS911 app and Signal Enhancer.</i><p><i><br/></i></p><p></p><h1>The DOTS911 app is insurance against getting stranded without mobile coverage.</h1><p>When
 you can’t make a call, the DOTS911 app uses a combination of the 
individual user’s data and crowd-sourced data to find the nearest 
available mobile phone signal.   In areas with user-provided data 
preloaded from our servers, you’ll find the nearest signal for your 
phone, but even if you’re the first explorer in a new area you’ll be led
 back to the last place where you personally had a signal.
These two features are highly complementary.  Neither depends on a 
current data connection, making them unique among signal-related 
smartphone apps.  When a user has an accident and needs to find cell 
phone reception, the first feature shows the last location along the 
road or trail behind him where he can find it.  The second feature 
provides crowd-sourced signal data collected before the signal was lost,
 leading the user to the nearest location where anyone has ever seen a 
usable signal.</p><p>Signal location data will even be accessible on our website so you can 
view it with your computer and print it before a trip through a remote 
area, making it useful for those without a smartphone.</p><h1>The DOTS911 app and signal enhancer prototypes work for our beta testers today.</h1><p>Both
 hardware and software prototypes already perform exceptionally well.  
The software has already allowed beta testers to find a signal and avoid
 getting lost on multiple occasions. The hardware has been used to make
 calls in many isolated areas where there is usually no useable mobile 
signal, and closer to home it’s been used to increase data transfer 
rates by a factor of 10-100x by increasing 4G signal strength, instantly
 converting a 3G connection to 4G. Check out feedback from some of our beta testers:</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FyVUtwI6FICM&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyVUtwI6FICM&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FyVUtwI6FICM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><i>The above video shows testimonials from some of our beta testers.</i><p></p><p><i><br/></i></p><h1>The DOTS911 signal enhancer can boost your signal by up to 30x, works with
 every cell phone on the planet, requires no power, and is 10x cheaper 
than the competition.<br/>
</h1><p>Our signal enhancers don’t require any 
special port on your phone.  Set your phone in the holder and you can 
boost your signal strength signal by up to 15 dB with no wires, no required 
power source, and at a tenth the price of powered signal repeaters that 
are much less successful at finding a signal in remote areas.  This can 
be the difference between no service and 2-3 bars of signal, between a 
patchy 2 bars and steady 5 bars of signal, or between a 200 kbps and a 
20 Mbps data transfer rate. </p><p></p><p><b>The enhancer has meaningful gain at all current cell phone
frequencies.</b> The gain is more as the enhancer size increases. Also, the
higher the frequency, the more the gain is. If and when the proposed 5 GHz. cell
band is utilized, our gain will be considerable more than what we have
conservatively disclosed. At Sprint WiMAX data frequencies of 2.5+ GHz we have
seen gain of 15dB =X30 for the Ultra 16"", 12dB =X15 for full 12"", and
9+dB=X8 for the compact 8 inch enhancer. When we went to the remote high desert

<p>Thank you for taking time to view our campaign!</p>
<p>If you can’t afford or don’t want to buy our signal enhancer,
no hard feelings. We’re still going to
tell you a fact we discovered along the way that may end up saving your life. It’s simple, but can be deadly serious!</p>
<p>Consider the following example we investigated while
developing our products. We heard a news
story of a missing couple in California who had driven in a 
4-wheel-drive
vehicle to Burnside Lake, 5 ½ miles off the junction of highways 88 and 
89. Their timing was ill fated – once they reached
the area a heavy winter storm left their car immobilized in snow. They 
had no working mobile phone signal where they were stranded.  The next 
morning, as the storm continued, one of
them tried to escape the area to find help on foot and died a mile north
 of the lake.</p>
<p>Once the weather cleared, we drove to Burnside Lake to test
our signal enhancer and determine whether it would have prevented this tragic
loss.  On the way we had lunch at a
resort less than a mile from the entrance to the dirt road leading to the lake. Nick, an employee at the resort, told us that he had gone there himself only two weeks before the couple got
stuck.  He had the same major mobile
phone carrier that we use and he told us that he got a strong signal there, so
strong in fact that he could watch YouTube videos in his tent at night.</p>
<p>We then drove to the lake to verify his claim.  He was right.  We realized that if one of the couple had a
phone with one major mobile carrier and the other used the other major carrier,
that instead of needing to call 911, they probably would have called for a tow
truck and gotten out before the heavy snowfall and maybe even had a pleasant lunch at the
nearby resort.</p>
<p>This is often the case: the service areas of each mobile
phone carrier can be radically different from the others, especially away from major
cities.  When choosing a carrier or planning
for a trip to an area that may be isolated, we urge you to remember this story
and the benefits of having access to emergency services through multiple
independent mobile phone networks.</p>

But if you would like to add additional Perks, simple 'up' your contribution, and select the one reward. When the campaign is over we will send out a survey to all those contributing more than the Perk selected, and you select the additional Perks you want that you have contributed for. The survey will also verify where you want them shipped. Please limit the number of Perks to a maximum of ten.</p><p><b>Why are some pledge levels only receiving the Android app?</b></p><p>We
 apologize for any confusion.  Let us clarify: if a pledge reward level 
includes a copy of the mobile phone app, it can be on your platform of 
choice.  However, we expect the Android app to be ready with our first 
batch of production signal enhancers while the iOS app is targeted for 
launch when we ship our second batch of signal enhancers.  However, <b><i>if
 you want a signal enhancer from the first batch and pledge at that 
level, you can request the iOS app and receive it as soon as it's 
launched.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Why isn't international shipping included?</b></p>
<p>International Shipping prices vary by location and country
and the size of signal enhancer you ordered. It’s simpler (and cheaper for you)
for us to handle this separately. After the campaign is over and we are
ready to start shipping, you will receive an invitation to go to our website
and enter your shipping information to pay the appropriate amount. </p>
<p><b>Why are the international signal enhancers slightly
higher priced? </b></p>
<p>At the moment, the additional handling, regulatory
requirements, shipping costs in case of replacements, and support needs abroad
demand more of our team. We currently have no manufacturing or assembly
operations outside of the USA, so for now we cannot reduce our costs by
shipping from a different country. We really do care about shipping our
products to all parts of the world, so please understand.</p>

 phones are everywhere - in February 2012, there were over 5 billion 
active mobile phone accounts.  Globally, nearly everyone carries a 
mobile phone almost all the time and these ubiquitous devices are great 
tools for getting help when you’re lost or trying to resolve infrequent 
but critical events like a car accident or an injury.  However, 
accidents on the road or on trails often occur in locations without cell
 phone reception, and the economics of improving signal coverage are 
such that wilderness areas and a huge fraction of roads will have 
massive coverage gaps for decades to come.  An estimated 100,000 people die each year because they need help in remote areas and can't make a call.When you're stuck in 
one of these no-coverage areas and need help, our iOS and Android signal
 finder app will lead you back to the nearest signal.  Our Signal 
Enhancer hardware will amplify whatever signal you do have, often making
 the difference between having no useable service nearby and being able 
to instantly make a call.
Why you need the DOTS911 app:
 1. For
everyday use to record a dot where your
car is parked and then get back to it easily.
 2. For recording dot breadcrumbs to
retrace your exact path back to your hotel or the start of your hike, ride, hunt, or car journey.  So you don’t have to depend on the kindness of
strangers.3. In an emergency or not, DOTS911 will lead you to a usable cell signal.The above video shows a first time user following the DOTS911 app to retrace her steps in order to get out of a wilderness area with no trails.Why you need the Signal Enhancer: 
(that
works with every cell phone and involves no wires or batteries)
 1.
To get a better signal
inside your house, giving you a more
reliable connection and faster data speed.  Just leave it in the 
DOTS911 phone
holder while it charges, make calls via Bluetooth accessories, and use 
it as a hot spot to provide internet service to all your devices.2. To provide improved signal strength in emergencies.  This allows your phone to work in many places where otherwise there is no
usable signal.  When your car is broken down or you're on a hike, the Signal Enhancer can amplify a weak signal thereby increasing the likelihood of being able to call for
help when otherwise you'd be stuck without any phone service.The above video shows a demonstration in which a call is made from a ""red dot"" location with no usable phone signal in Big Basin, CA.DOTS911 is insurance against getting stranded without mobile coverage.When
 an accident happens and you have no mobile signal, the lifeline in your
 pocket becomes no more useful than a brick.  Unfortunately, when you 
don't have reception, there's no easy way to tell where or how to find 
it.  Tragic stories based on this conundrum frequently make headlines, 
with stranded hikers or motorists unable to find help despite being 
close to a location with good phone reception.  That reception isn't 
useful to them because it’s invisible.
See some examples in our video below: The above video shows real life examples of people who could have benefited from the DOTS911 app and Signal Enhancer.The DOTS911 app is insurance against getting stranded without mobile coverage.When
 you can’t make a call, the DOTS911 app uses a combination of the 
individual user’s data and crowd-sourced data to find the nearest 
available mobile phone signal.   In areas with user-provided data 
preloaded from our servers, you’ll find the nearest signal for your 
phone, but even if you’re the first explorer in a new area you’ll be led
 back to the last place where you personally had a signal.
These two features are highly complementary.  Neither depends on a 
current data connection, making them unique among signal-related 
smartphone apps.  When a user has an accident and needs to find cell 
phone reception, the first feature shows the last location along the 
road or trail behind him where he can find it.  The second feature 
provides crowd-sourced signal data collected before the signal was lost,
 leading the user to the nearest location where anyone has ever seen a 
usable signal.Signal location data will even be accessible on our website so you can 
view it with your computer and print it before a trip through a remote 
area, making it useful for those without a smartphone.The DOTS911 app and signal enhancer prototypes work for our beta testers today.Both
 hardware and software prototypes already perform exceptionally well.  
The software has already allowed beta testers to find a signal and avoid
 getting lost on multiple occasions. The hardware has been used to make
 calls in many isolated areas where there is usually no useable mobile 
signal, and closer to home it’s been used to increase data transfer 
rates by a factor of 10-100x by increasing 4G signal strength, instantly
 converting a 3G connection to 4G. Check out feedback from some of our beta testers:The above video shows testimonials from some of our beta testers.The DOTS911 signal enhancer can boost your signal by up to 30x, works with
 every cell phone on the planet, requires no power, and is 10x cheaper 
than the competition.
Our signal enhancers don’t require any 
special port on your phone.  Set your phone in the holder and you can 
boost your signal strength signal by up to 15 dB with no wires, no required 
power source, and at a tenth the price of powered signal repeaters that 
are much less successful at finding a signal in remote areas.  This can 
be the difference between no service and 2-3 bars of signal, between a 
patchy 2 bars and steady 5 bars of signal, or between a 200 kbps and a 
20 Mbps data transfer rate. The enhancer has meaningful gain at all current cell phone
frequencies. The gain is more as the enhancer size increases. Also, the
higher the frequency, the more the gain is. If and when the proposed 5 GHz. cell
band is utilized, our gain will be considerable more than what we have
conservatively disclosed. At Sprint WiMAX data frequencies of 2.5+ GHz we have
seen gain of 15dB =X30 for the Ultra 16"", 12dB =X15 for full 12"", and
9+dB=X8 for the compact 8 inch enhancer. When we went to the remote high desert
site in Nevada near where a Jeep with six overturned last December, they were not able to make a cell call, but we were able to easily make a cell call with the 12 inch signal enhancer.
And that was connecting to a low frequency tower in the 850 MHz band. See our

But if you would like to add additional Perks, simple 'up' your contribution, and select the one reward. When the campaign is over we will send out a survey to all those contributing more than the Perk selected, and you select the additional Perks you want that you have contributed for. The survey will also verify where you want them shipped. Please limit the number of Perks to a maximum of ten.Why are some pledge levels only receiving the Android app?We
 apologize for any confusion.  Let us clarify: if a pledge reward level 
includes a copy of the mobile phone app, it can be on your platform of 
choice.  However, we expect the Android app to be ready with our first 
batch of production signal enhancers while the iOS app is targeted for 
launch when we ship our second batch of signal enhancers.  However, if
 you want a signal enhancer from the first batch and pledge at that 
level, you can request the iOS app and receive it as soon as it's 
launched.
Why isn't international shipping included?
International Shipping prices vary by location and country
and the size of signal enhancer you ordered. It’s simpler (and cheaper for you)
for us to handle this separately. After the campaign is over and we are
ready to start shipping, you will receive an invitation to go to our website
and enter your shipping information to pay the appropriate amount. 
Why are the international signal enhancers slightly
higher priced? 
At the moment, the additional handling, regulatory
requirements, shipping costs in case of replacements, and support needs abroad
demand more of our team. We currently have no manufacturing or assembly
operations outside of the USA, so for now we cannot reduce our costs by
shipping from a different country. We really do care about shipping our
products to all parts of the world, so please understand.
How big are the signal enhancers?

Compact enhancers with bridge, phone holder, stand, and packing can
fit in an 
8 1/2” x 11” x 2 ” OD box. weight 16 oz

Full size enhancers with bridge, phone holder, stand, and packing
can fit in a 
12” x 12” x 2” OD box.      weight  1 lb 8 oz

The Ultra enhancer with bridge, phone holder, stand, and packing
can fit in a 
19” x 19” x 2” OD box.
Will DOTS911 offer a warranty?
Yes.  We will guarantee that you will receive a working signal
enhancer and will warranty it against manufacturing defects for 1 year. We
 will provide written and video instructions on our website showing
you how to test and use your signal enhancer.
Will uploading my signal data be anonymous?
It’s up to you!  You
can upload completely anonymously if you’d like.  On the other hand, if you upload signal
information and would like to have your account associated with it, that’s an
option as well.  In the latter case,
we’ll be sure to give you recognition when a user benefits from your data.  With sufficient funding we plan to add an
achievement system to recognize our explorers.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank those who were an 
inspiration to us through their personal ordeals.  Because of you and 
your experiences, many lives will be saved.  With additional thanks to

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Open Creativity for All</b></p>
<p>The
 Luna ROX V8 empowers ALL filmmakers and photographers like never before.  
Creative inspiration and brilliance should be open to anyone, and not 
just the chosen few who can afford high-priced editing equipment or 
$650+ phones.  With the Luna ROX V8, you now have all the tools necessary to 
produce and present an entire HD quality film.  Given its affordability,
 our phone is THE creative and sharing tool for the<b> </b>burgeoning community of bright producers. </p>
<p><b><b>HEVC plus Octa-core Power</b></b></p>
<p>The
 Luna ROX V8 uses the new codec, HEVC H.265, replacing H.264 (mp4), however our phone is still backward compatible with all your current MP4 files.  HEVC is twice as efficient, but requires a more powerful CPU.  Our 8-core processor gets the job done. </p>
<p><b>Complete Studio in a Phone</b></p>
<p>It's  a complete solution for shooting video and pictures, instant editing, uploading, or live streaming right on the device. The 
desktop-like power makes it possible in a smartphone with all threads managed by CorePilot™. That's raw power!</p>
<p><b><b>Film-Edit-Upload</b></b></p>
<p>In
 rare cases, the final end product will make it to film, but the 
majority of new content is now uploaded directly to the web for 
immediate playback.  With LTE data speed, edited footage can be uploaded 
to any site on the Internet with lightning speed.  Furthermore, the new 
HEVC standard means uploaded content will now be half the file size and 
take half the time to upload.  And with its powerful MT6595 Octa-core 
Chipset, the Luna ROX V8 will be one of only three phones in the market to 
support this 4K Ultra HD standard.</p>
<p><b><b>Attach it and GOGO with Live Streaming</b></b></p>
<p>Much
 of the exciting content created these days comes from mobile cameras 
placed in new and interesting ways. The Luna ROX V8, with its 13 mega-pixel high definition camera,
 can easily mount to your bike, car, helicopter drone, etc. for quick 
and easy filming.  Best of all, the integrated LTE data connection 
allows you to LIVE STREAM directly to the web, all in a single device.</p>
<p><b><b>Large 5.5” Screen and FHD</b></b></p>
<p>We
 specifically chose a large, full HD screen for the precise purpose of 
easily viewing and editing content right on your phone.  When out in the
 field, there is no more need for a separate monitor to make sure you’ve
 got the perfect shot.  Details like this really do matter when bringing
 creative projects to life.</p>

<br/>We take great pride in the smartphone we are bringing to market.  The Luna ROX V8 meets or exceeds the competition in nearly every category.  But the real value is in the combination of our feature set.  You won't find this in any other phone on the market today.  And you can get the Luna ROX V8 at a fraction of the price of the competition.  You be the judge. <br/><p><br/></p>

<br/>There are basically two types of cell phone networks in the US: GSM &amp; CDMA.  The Luna Rox V8 operates on GSM networks.  There are many 
well-known GSM providers for you to choose from including AT&amp;T, 
MetroPCS, T-Mobile, Walmart and dozens of other companies who actually 
encourage you to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).  We love that and you 
will too.  They will give you something called a 'SIM card' which you 
slip into the LUNA ROX V8 and away you go!  Simple is Smarter™.<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Note:
 Sprint, Verizon and their affiliate providers are operating on a CDMA 
network which does not accept GSM phones.  Too bad for them.</b></p>

</div></div>","ROX V8 raises the bar for top performance smartphones, with the Mediatek MT6595 SoC (System on a Chip), the world’s first 'true multi-processing' 8-core mobile CPU.  The MT6595 recently tested above 47,000 in initial AnTuTu tests-- more than 20% faster than the Samsung Galaxy S5, HTC One M8, and OnePlus One (GSMArena 7/15/14).  Luna plans to initially sell direct to consumer, keeping distribution costs at a minimum.  The Luna ROX V8 also comes ‘unlocked’ allowing the freedom to change providers at any time.“The ROX V8 has state-of-the-art features and power to make it one of the top smartphones ever,” says Todd Walker, founder and CEO of Luna Mobile.  “The phone meets or exceeds our competition in almost every way,” adds Chief Innovation Officer James Mayiras.  “Raw speed only has value when combined with functional benefits that simplify your life.  That’s what makes ROX V8 the ultimate smartphone, ready to become your ‘everything’.  Presently, no company or product provides this complete solution that customers crave.”

 cores are OK, but octa-core phones are better.  Experience powerful, yet

power or roar to life when you need it.

 is the old standard.  New video achieves better quality with HEVC and 
VP9 for UHD 4K with drastically smaller files.  The Luna ROX V8 is one of the first to hardware
 accelerate this new standard for smooth playback. 
 Without it, your phone is obsolete for video playback in 2015.

Open Creativity for All
The
 Luna ROX V8 empowers ALL filmmakers and photographers like never before.  
Creative inspiration and brilliance should be open to anyone, and not 
just the chosen few who can afford high-priced editing equipment or 
$650+ phones.  With the Luna ROX V8, you now have all the tools necessary to 
produce and present an entire HD quality film.  Given its affordability,
 our phone is THE creative and sharing tool for the burgeoning community of bright producers. 
HEVC plus Octa-core Power
The
 Luna ROX V8 uses the new codec, HEVC H.265, replacing H.264 (mp4), however our phone is still backward compatible with all your current MP4 files.  HEVC is twice as efficient, but requires a more powerful CPU.  Our 8-core processor gets the job done. 
Complete Studio in a Phone
It's  a complete solution for shooting video and pictures, instant editing, uploading, or live streaming right on the device. The 
desktop-like power makes it possible in a smartphone with all threads managed by CorePilot™. That's raw power!
Film-Edit-Upload
In
 rare cases, the final end product will make it to film, but the 
majority of new content is now uploaded directly to the web for 
immediate playback.  With LTE data speed, edited footage can be uploaded 
to any site on the Internet with lightning speed.  Furthermore, the new 
HEVC standard means uploaded content will now be half the file size and 
take half the time to upload.  And with its powerful MT6595 Octa-core 
Chipset, the Luna ROX V8 will be one of only three phones in the market to 
support this 4K Ultra HD standard.
Attach it and GOGO with Live Streaming
Much
 of the exciting content created these days comes from mobile cameras 
placed in new and interesting ways. The Luna ROX V8, with its 13 mega-pixel high definition camera,
 can easily mount to your bike, car, helicopter drone, etc. for quick 
and easy filming.  Best of all, the integrated LTE data connection 
allows you to LIVE STREAM directly to the web, all in a single device.
Large 5.5” Screen and FHD
We
 specifically chose a large, full HD screen for the precise purpose of 
easily viewing and editing content right on your phone.  When out in the
 field, there is no more need for a separate monitor to make sure you’ve
 got the perfect shot.  Details like this really do matter when bringing
 creative projects to life.




We take great pride in the smartphone we are bringing to market.  The Luna ROX V8 meets or exceeds the competition in nearly every category.  But the real value is in the combination of our feature set.  You won't find this in any other phone on the market today.  And you can get the Luna ROX V8 at a fraction of the price of the competition.  You be the judge.

There are basically two types of cell phone networks in the US: GSM & CDMA.  The Luna Rox V8 operates on GSM networks.  There are many 
well-known GSM providers for you to choose from including AT&T, 
MetroPCS, T-Mobile, Walmart and dozens of other companies who actually 
encourage you to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).  We love that and you 
will too.  They will give you something called a 'SIM card' which you 
slip into the LUNA ROX V8 and away you go!  Simple is Smarter™.
Note:
 Sprint, Verizon and their affiliate providers are operating on a CDMA 
network which does not accept GSM phones.  Too bad for them.







LUNA
 Mobile is a USA-based start-up company whose mission is to provide the 
consumer with high-quality feature-rich mobile phones at a fraction of 
the cost of the big guys.  We are tired of carriers that force phone owners into contracts and lock your expensive hardware to their system.  If you buy the Luna ROX V8, you get to choose your carrier.
With
 your support to fund our initial production, we can bring this vision 
to reality, offering the consumer a new way of communicating.  Simple is smarter.
Be
 a backer on Indiegogo today and get VIP access to the first 
manufacturing run of a premium-class smartphone at a price well below 
any of our competitors.

<p>We have put this project online to judge the demand for and also to help to optimize our network for an <strong>accelerated VPN service</strong>.  Unlike traditional VPN services, the primary focus of WTFast VPN will be to reach unmatched levels of speed and security for our users.  Our talented team will achieve this through our extensive experience with WTFast.</p>
<p>We have set $10k as our target to reach with pledges because we determined that it is what we would need to launch a small scale VPN operation.  However, the ideal outcome will be significantly more money raised through your pledges.  The more pledges we receive, the more AWESOME we can make the VPN network. </p>

<p><strong>March 31 Update</strong> - Today we passed $1000 in pledges, thanks guys, your pledges will help ensure a successful launch.  We really appreciate your support!</p>

We have put this project online to judge the demand for and also to help to optimize our network for an accelerated VPN service.  Unlike traditional VPN services, the primary focus of WTFast VPN will be to reach unmatched levels of speed and security for our users.  Our talented team will achieve this through our extensive experience with WTFast.
We have set $10k as our target to reach with pledges because we determined that it is what we would need to launch a small scale VPN operation.  However, the ideal outcome will be significantly more money raised through your pledges.  The more pledges we receive, the more AWESOME we can make the VPN network.

<div>      My name is Jack Belliveau I am a fabricator, an artist, an engineer and a dreamer.  I have several degrees, Including an Associates in Business, a Masters in Film and Television (working on the PhD). I am also a certified welder (MIG, TIG) a former ASE Certified Mechanic, and a Certified Personal Trainer.<br/>     This campaign is to help me complete a project that I first conceived over 13 years ago while sitting in 7th grade English class. A self reliant, sealed electric vehicle that could maintain constant power/charge without any need for plugs or cords. A vehicle Currently being called EVC-1 (Electric Vehicle Conversion 1)<br/>     My goal is to fabricate a second prototype of my power plant/battery/controller/motor assembly that can be fitted as a drop in kit for nearly any roadworthy vehicle and be able to be installed by most mechanically inclined people. Imagine driving your own vehicle to the beach for the weekend and not spending more on fuel than the Hotel costs. <br/><h3> </h3>
<h2>Where I'm at so far:</h2>
<p>     Up to this point I have designed and fabricated a test module as well as a small scale prototype for the initial test vehicle. Both were successful at proving my concept but the small scale prototype was only enough to power a pretty cool (If I do say so myself) powerwheels car.</p>
<p>     Here is what I'm asking from you...$1. That is all, I will not ask for anybody to give more than that(but, if you feel like you must, I won't deny you that happiness). I need $15,000 in order to build the initial kit and get it roadworthy via a donor vehicle, however this project is, what I like to call a community project. I don't think it would be fair to offer super cool perks to people who can afford to donate more, but don't truly believe in my dream when someone who maybe can only afford $1 believes in my cause ten times more.</p>
<p>     All of the money collected will be used in the purchase of raw materials and shop time. My team and I will be doing most of, if not all of the fabrication and machining from raw materials . We just don't haveall of  the equipment needed to do so, but have equipment and shop space we can rent available to us.</p>
<p>     I believe that there are 15,000 people in this world who have dreams. 15,000 people who want to see some one else succeed in one of theirs. All I need is 15,000 people to donate $1 to my project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What about the 15,000 dreamers?</h2>
<p>     Everybody who donates will have their names shadow painted onto one of the many body surfaces of the vehicle as well as included in the credits of the coinciding documentary film. But wait, there's more. each person will recieve a digital copy of the film, as well as a photo print of the vehicle and an upclose shot of their name placement.</p>
<h2>Where I want to be at:</h2>
<p>     My goal is to have the first roadworthy prototype good to go for initial testing by February 20th 2013 at which time we will journey from Salisbury, NC to Myrtle Beach, SC non stop having worked out all of the bugs by June 1st 2013. At that point I will gather my team of mechanics and fellow film makers and we will take the EVC-1 Key West Florida where, with chase vehicles in tow we will drive nonstop to Los Angeles California. Stopping only to change out drivers while others eat or sleep in one of the follow vehicles.</p>
<p>     This entire journey, as well as the entire fabrication and testing process will be documented and compiled into a documentary about my dream, and about how the world, as a community can band together and make a positive change.</p>
<p>    **** In order to fund the documentary I plan on either starting another Indiegogo fundraiser, selling advertisement space on the chase vehicles(no advertisements will be placed on the EVC-1) or organizing a local fundraiser with the help of the vast film and arts community right here in the Salisbury, Charlotte area.****</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>My end game:</h2>
<p>     Through my development I would like to be able to produce an easy to install, reliable, safe and revolutionary Electric Vehicle conversion kit that I can produce for less than $7,500 per unit while at the same time creating a unique, informative and entertaining look into the development of a dream.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to early support from the <span>Jacki Zehner and the Zehner Family Foundation, who </span>pledged $6,000 towards this app, we only need $20k more to make it happen!</em></p>
<p>We estimate that we need $26k to be able to develop and release a #NotBuyingIt mobile app to empower millions worldwide to call-out sexist media wherever and whenever they see it. About 90% of the funds will go directly to the developers designing and creating the application, and the rest will help us market the completed product to the general public.</p>
<p>We promise you that every dollar you contribute will go towards this project, and the more we raise beyond the $26k goal, the better and more effective the end product will be!  </p>

<p>During the 2013 Super Bowl - the most watched and tweeted about media event of the year - the #NotBuyingIt hashtag was used by thousands to reach over 4 million people on Twitter with a critique of sexism in the commercials. Go Daddy alone received over 7,000 #NotBuyingIt tweets during the game. It was an astounding display of what we’re capable of when we come together as a community to challenge misogyny, gender stereotypes and related harmful messages in the media.</p>
<p>Imagine what more we could do (and say) with this easy-to-use app at the fingertips of passionate and caring people worldwide! If 10,000 tweets during the Super Bowl can reach 4 million+ people, how much noise could 100,000 people with the #NotBuyingIt app make?</p>

<p><strong>Web &amp; Mobile Apps / Games That Aim To Improve Health</strong></p>
<p>The word “health” means something different to everyone. No matter how it is defined, for all of us, our health is significantly impacted by our own choices. Body image is a major influence on our choices. Emerge takes evidence-based programs that improve body image, eating disorders, and weight management and adapts them into interactive media and technologies aimed at transforming thoughts, perceptions and behaviors. Emerge programs aim to empower individuals to seek health and thriving as the desired endpoint, rather than unattainable appearance goals.</p>
<p>These unattainable appearance goals are often perpetuated by the media - appearance ideals are promoted and products are sold to glamourize those ideals and/or help individuals realize those ideas..no matter how harmful. The impact of harmful media exposure that glamorize ideas for body image, size, shape, youth, and optimum fitness, on body image and eating disorders is well documented in scientific research studies. Emerge seeks to develop apps that focus on the role that media and advertising play in shaping our ideals for health and beauty and gives consumers a voice in what media they find helpful and what media they find harmful.</p>

Thanks to early support from the Jacki Zehner and the Zehner Family Foundation, who pledged $6,000 towards this app, we only need $20k more to make it happen!
We estimate that we need $26k to be able to develop and release a #NotBuyingIt mobile app to empower millions worldwide to call-out sexist media wherever and whenever they see it. About 90% of the funds will go directly to the developers designing and creating the application, and the rest will help us market the completed product to the general public.
We promise you that every dollar you contribute will go towards this project, and the more we raise beyond the $26k goal, the better and more effective the end product will be!

A seat at the creative table behind the #NotBuyingIt App







During the 2013 Super Bowl - the most watched and tweeted about media event of the year - the #NotBuyingIt hashtag was used by thousands to reach over 4 million people on Twitter with a critique of sexism in the commercials. Go Daddy alone received over 7,000 #NotBuyingIt tweets during the game. It was an astounding display of what we’re capable of when we come together as a community to challenge misogyny, gender stereotypes and related harmful messages in the media.
Imagine what more we could do (and say) with this easy-to-use app at the fingertips of passionate and caring people worldwide! If 10,000 tweets during the Super Bowl can reach 4 million+ people, how much noise could 100,000 people with the #NotBuyingIt app make?



Here are some of the past successes this hashtag has had on Twitter:


Pressured Amazon.co.uk to remove a line of t-shirts promoting rape in under 24 hours

Forced America’s leading Halloween costume seller to change how it markets girls’ costumes

Pressured a solar company to rescind a sexist ad campaign and delete their Facebook page

Helped get Hallmark to remove a sexist greeting card in under 24 hours

About MissRepresentation.org:

After directing the award-winning Sundance documentary Miss Representation in 2011 - which premiered on the Oprah Winfrey Network and exposed how the misrepresentation of women in the media is leading to the underrepresentation of women in positions of power - Jennifer Siebel Newsom created MissRepresentation.org to empower ordinary individuals to continue challenging sexist media in their own lives.
About Emer.ge

Web & Mobile Apps / Games That Aim To Improve Health
The word “health” means something different to everyone. No matter how it is defined, for all of us, our health is significantly impacted by our own choices. Body image is a major influence on our choices. Emerge takes evidence-based programs that improve body image, eating disorders, and weight management and adapts them into interactive media and technologies aimed at transforming thoughts, perceptions and behaviors. Emerge programs aim to empower individuals to seek health and thriving as the desired endpoint, rather than unattainable appearance goals.
These unattainable appearance goals are often perpetuated by the media - appearance ideals are promoted and products are sold to glamourize those ideals and/or help individuals realize those ideas..no matter how harmful. The impact of harmful media exposure that glamorize ideas for body image, size, shape, youth, and optimum fitness, on body image and eating disorders is well documented in scientific research studies. Emerge seeks to develop apps that focus on the role that media and advertising play in shaping our ideals for health and beauty and gives consumers a voice in what media they find helpful and what media they find harmful.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Smartphones. iPads. Tablets. They're essential pieces of our high-tech lifestyles. People everywhere are now relying on mobile power more than ever before.</p>
<p>But have you ever been in a situation when you needed immediate access to an electrical outlet, yet you couldn't find one? Maybe you were expecting an important phone call from someone, and then saw that your smartphone's battery was low. Or, maybe you occasionally forget to fully-charge your favorite tablet before leaving the house. <br/></p>
<p>No one can afford to miss an important phone call, or struggle with using an iPad that has just 7% battery-life remaining.. <br/></p>
<p>Many of us run into these situations multiple times per week, if not each day. We've all been in these predicaments. <br/></p>
<p>And our team is here to solve these issues <i>before </i>they happen. But we're doing more than just that. We're solving the 
problems that come with lacking access to mobile power - but we're also doing it in a beautiful way. <br/></p>

<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Impressive Batteries</h4>
<ul>
</ul>The heart and lungs of our device consists of its three impressive battery cells. The battery cells make up the primary source of energy for the internal circuit, and also provide the output power for your personal high-tech electronic devices. <br/>
<br/>The DreamCharger uses the commonly known 18650 cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. Most laptops actually use these types of batteries. Therefore, they're some of the most mature and reliable batteries on the market. After testing all of the 18650 battery cells on the market, our team decided to utilize the SANYO UR18650F, which is a world-class battery cell with light-blue insulation rings, and red tubes. <br/><br/>The advantages of our batteries include utilizing an ultra-high discharge plateau - which provides a better conversion efficiency for the internal boost converter circuit. The batteries also have a low internal resistance of less than 45 milliohms, which increases discharging efficiency, and reduces the overall heat that's generated.  <br/><br/>This low self-discharge rate will preserve most initial energy when it's not in use. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1053160/files/20141128044907-_1.jpg?1417178947"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Our batteries offer a longer service life: meaning that more than 80% of the design capacity is reserved after 300+ charge/discharge cycles. The batteries are completely safe and secure. We've minimized the risk of explosion and spontaneous combustion. We've never experienced such an accident, nor have any accidents with the cells been reported so far. The typical capacity of a single SANYO UR18650F is 2600mAh. We've equipped the DreamCharger with three of these cells, equaling a total capacity of 7800mAh. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h4>Dimensions &amp; Weight</h4>
<ul>
</ul>The battery pack's total dimensions are 54mm x 65mm x 18mm. Our three battery cells weigh a total of 141g. After minimizing the overall design as much as possible (down to the millimeter) we've achieved a total size of 67.6mm x 104mm x 22.7mm for the DreamCharger. <br/>
<br/>The overall size of the DreamCharger is only 39mm longer, 13.6mm wider, and 4.7mm thicker than its battery pack (approximately as big as two iPhone 4s'). The overall weight of the DreamCharger is 198g, or 57g heavier than the battery pack. </div><div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1045009/files/20141124234003-dimension.jpg?1416901203"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<br/>We could have reduced the overall weight even more by minimizing the thickness of the plastic shell, but we didn't want to compromise the DreamCharger's strength &amp; durability. <br/>Beyond the miniscule details - the DreamCharger is extremely lightweight for the power that it provides electronic devices with.   </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1045297/files/20141125024308-pigu.jpg?1416912188"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h4>Output Capacity</h4>
<ul>
</ul>As mobile devices become bigger, faster and stronger - internal battery capacities must also increase as a result of this. More power is needed from external supplies to generate more powerful devices. <br/>
<br/>It has now even become commonplace for people to leave the house with multiple electronic devices. You may need to charge a smartphone and a tablet device at the same time, or share charging capabilities with a friend (be your friend's hero). <br/><br/>Based on all of this, we've designed two standard (Type-A) USB output ports for the DreamCharger. <br/>
<br/><ul>
<li>One of our ports is a low power output port, providing 5V, 1A maximum output, which can charge almost all mobile phones. </li>
<li>The other port is a high power output port, providing 5.2V, 2.4A maximum output, which can charge both mobile phones, <b>and</b> the latest pads/tablets. </li>
</ul>
The most powerful adapter that Apple equips the iPad with is a 5.2V/2.4A/12Watt adapter. Our high power output port is designed with this specification in mind, and is fully compatible with Apple's recognition standard. Therefore, all iPhones and iPads can be charged at their maximum current by using this port. <br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1045347/files/20141125031822-output.jpg?1416914302"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h4>Efficiency</h4>
<ul>
</ul>Higher efficiency means more energy output, and lower generated heat. A typical lithium-ion battery is 2.7V to 4.2V. To get between 5V and 5.2V output voltage, it needs the help of a boost converter circuit. <br/><br/>Most mobile power chargers use non-synchronous boost circuits, which means a lower cost, and a lower conversion efficiency (at around 80%). We didn't want to go down this low-quality route. <b>We needed to achieve high-quality</b>, and a high current output, in order to maximize efficiency, and to reduce the overall heat that is generated through our charger. <br/>
<br/>The DreamCharger utilizes a synchronous boost circuit, setting the average conversion efficiency at different loads ranging up to, or even higher than 90%. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p></p>
<h4>Automatic Recognition Adapters  </h4>
<p>The charging current is typically set at a fixed rate for general mobile power. <br/>But sometimes, problems can occur because of this. Connecting mobile power to a computer's USB 2.0 port (to charge a device) can trigger protection of the computer, and even possibly damage the USB port. This happens because standard USB 2.0 ports on computers can only provide 0.5A maximum output current. <br/><br/>To solve this, we've added an ""automatic recognition circuit"" to the DreamCharger. <br/><br/>So when DreamCharger connects to an adapter, it will automatically identify one of the three generic, main types of chargers. The DreamCharger will then limit the current drawn from the corresponding charger type, preventing hazards from occurring.</p>

<br/>
<h4>User Interface - Working Status Indicator<br/>
</h4>
<ul>
</ul>DreamCharger uses a 0.96inch, 128 x 64 dot-matrix white light OLED panel.<br/><br/>OLED provides many benefits such as self-luminous, high contrast, high viewing angle, high temperature stability and more. This provides the DreamCharger with an excellent display. All of the information that the DreamCharger provides you with is displayed through text or icons in this OLED panel. The OLED panel vividly displays the working status of DreamCharger in four modes: standing by, discharging, charging or charge over. <br/><br/>If the DreamCharger enters protection operation mode, it will indicate: temp too high, temp too low, or overload. This protection function is considered to be the most comprehensive aspect of the DreamCharger. <br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1045013/files/20141124234401-status.jpg?1416901441"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h4>User Interface - Remaining Capacity Indicator</h4>
<ul>
</ul>
Currently, almost all mobile power sources have to ""guess"" the remaining capacity by detecting their batteries' voltage levels. The problem with this method of guessing remaining capacities is that battery voltage may change based on different ranges of load. Therefore, this is nothing less than indicating the remaining capacity through LED's. <br/>
<br/>Voltage of an empty battery will even increase after releasing for some time. This will show that there is a LED lighting, but the mobile power shuts down, once connected to a load. Again, this isn't an accurate method of calculation. <br/>
<br/>Through our continuous efforts, the accuracy of detecting the remaining capacity of the DreamCharger reaches an incredible 1mAh.  Meanwhile, the remaining percentage is up to 1%, and is shown by both the battery icon and Arabic numbers. <br/>
<br/>The more accurate our remaining capacity indicator is, the better you can take advantage of the DreamCharger. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1044995/files/20141124233139-remaining.jpg?1416900699"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">User Interface - Remaining Time for Charging and Discharging</span><br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>When you use a mobile power charger for your electronic devices, you want to see <i>accurate</i> charging data. This is what keeps you from encountering possible unfortunate situations. Being aware of your real-time charging &amp; discharging information at all times is about preventing bad outcomes from happening. It's about taking control. <br/><br/>You want to know the <i>exact </i>duration it will take for your DreamCharger to discharge to empty, and the duration of time that DreamCharger will need to be charged to full. <br/>
<br/>The benefit of 1mAh accurate precision is that if we simultaneously monitor the current flow into or out of the battery pack, we can get the remaining charge time to full, or discharge to empty. <br/><br/>We calculate these precise figures by using simple division: Remaining capacity (mAh) ÷ current. For example - when using the DreamCharger to charge a pad, assuming that the remaining capacity is full (7800mAh), and the current flowing out from the battery pack is 2000mA, the remaining time = 7800mAh÷2000mA = 3.9 hours. Similarly, when we charge the DreamCharger, assuming the remaining capacity is empty (0 mAh), and the current flowing into the battery pack is 1500mA, then the remaining time = (7800mAh - 0mAh) ÷ 1500mA = 5.2 hours. It's not too complex. DreamCharger can calculate these times with accuracy up to 1 minute, and will indicate these figures on-screen, automatically. <br/>
<br/>To go a little deeper, in order to prevent the current from jumping, the current is averaged. Thus, DreamCharger will take a few seconds to average the current at the initial stage of charging or discharging. The more stable the current, the more accurately the remaining time can be calculated for you.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1050977/files/20141127050647-_.jpg?1417093607"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<h4>User Interface - Battery Pack Status Monitor </h4>
<ul>
</ul>When you're driving a car, sometimes you may check your engine's temperature, your speed, and so on. This is all of the important information that is indicative of the health of your automobile. <br/>
<br/>DreamCharger provides an interface similar to this - but instead monitors your battery pack, cell temperature, remaining capacity, voltage, and current flown into or out. You can think of it as the automobile of your electronics. We also show the voltage's current value shown by the bar icon. <br/>
<br/>You can check the current and voltage VS maximum and minimum in the form of a simple ratio. For SANYO UR18650F (which the DreamCharger currently uses) the voltage 3V corresponds with an empty bar, while 4.2V corresponds with a full bar. <br/><br/>For the current bar, 0A corresponds with an empty bar, and 5A corresponds with full when discharging, or 2A corresponds with full when charging. <br/><br/>
<p><b>Tip:</b> When charging your devices, you can roughly estimate the current flowing out of the USB port. The formula is simple: battery voltage × battery current × 90% ÷ 5V (when using 5V/1A output port, or 5.2V when using 5.2V/2.4A port). ""90%"" is the average efficiency of the internal boost circuit. </p>

<br/>
<p></p>
<h4>User Interface - Advanced Information</h4>
<ul>
</ul>With the increase of battery charge-discharge cycles, the full-charge capacity of the battery will decrease, due to the process of Li-ion. In the advanced information screen, you can not only check the charge-discharge cycle number, but also the full-charge capacity. You can roughly determine the health of the battery pack through these two variables. <br/>
<br/>Nowadays, when you travel by air or another form of transportation, security personnel may check the design capacity and other information of your mobile power - and only compliant ones can be taken. <br/>
<br/>We mark the design capacity of the battery pack, battery manufacturer/model, chemical type of the battery, production date, serial number and so on. Some information will simultaneously be indicated on the shell too. </div><div><br/></div><div>

<br/><p></p>
<h4>Operation - The Simpler, The Better<br/>
</h4>
<ul>
</ul>While it seems as if the DreamCharger has a rich functionality and information indicator screen, it's actually very easy to use our device. This provides you with a winning product that packs high-power <b>and</b> a soft learning curve. <br/>
<br/>We designed only one recoil-slide switch for DreamCharger as a power and function switch, considering that when you put a mobile power device in your bag or pocket, a push-switch may cause a malfunction trigger more easily. </div><div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1048254/files/20141126035528-switch.jpg?1417002928"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<b><br/>How to Discharge: </b>The only thing you need to do is connect your device to the DreamCharger, and then short-slide the switch until DreamCharger is turned on. When the discharge is over (when your devices have been charged to 'full'), you'll have no need to manually turn off the DreamCharger. It will shut down automatically after 30 seconds, once detecting the end of the discharge.<br/><br/><b>How to Charge: </b>When you want to charge the DreamCharger, simply connect an adapter to the charge port of DreamCharger. It will automatically turn on, begin to charge, and then automatically stop when charged to full.<br/><br/>In fact - you can charge the DreamCharger at anytime that you like. However the DreamCharger cannot be charged when being discharged simultaneously. DreamCharger would then stop discharging, and change its status to charging preferentially. <br/>
<b><br/>Switching Between Different Screens: </b>Simply short-slide, or slide and hold for one second, then release. All screens can be switched by using this method. </div><div>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Low Self-Discharge - More Capacity Can be Maintained for Longer Periods of Time</h4>
<p>Self-discharge comes from two aspects: one is battery self-discharge, and the other is the leakage current from the internal circuit, when it shuts down. SANYO UR18650F batteries (which the DreamCharger equips) has a very low self-discharge rate. <br/></p>
<p>What we have to do is minimize the leakage current when shutting down. Through our continued exploration and testing, the leakage current is reduced to less than 1uA (0.001mA). Benefiting from these two aspects, the remaining capacity can be maintained for a long time, even if you don't use the DreamCharger for a long period of time. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Security - The Most Important Aspect of Mobile Power<br/>
</h4>Lithium is a highly reactive chemical compound, and the protection of the DreamCharger's batteries is highly important. We've placed security as a top priority from the very beginning of the DreamCharger project. Overall, the security aspect of DreamCharger can be divided into two categories of protection. <br/><br/><p>The first category of protection is the high level of input/output protection. <br/></p>
<p>This includes input voltage/current protection, output current protection, and delayed start of charging protection. This is a conventional protection. <br/></p>
<p>The second category is the low level of comprehensive protection for batteries, including better voltage/current protection, thermal protection, and charge-time protection. This level of protection generally isn't necessary unless the DreamCharger malfunctions. <br/></p>
<p> Of course, if all protection fails, there's a primitive layer of protection which the SANYO UR18650F itself provides. </p>
<p><b>Input Protection: </b>This protection will come into effect from the very moment that you connect a charger to the DreamCharger. The protection circuit will continue to detect the input voltage, then stop charging immediately, and disconnect the external charger once it's detected that the input voltage is higher than 6V. When you plug a damaged charger into the DreamCharger, this situation could occur.<br/></p>
<p>The ""automatic recognition circuit"" that we've mentioned above can also be considered a form of input protection. DreamCharger will determine the type of charger that you connect to, and will then control the maximum input current, in order to protect the external adapter from being damaged. </p>
<p><b>Delayed Start of Charging Protection: </b>We can say that we're the first group of innovators in history to add this form of protection to mobile power. Many people may recognize the experience of the moment that you plug certain household appliances into a wall socket, and you see sparks appear. This happens because, in the absence of the plug being fully inserted into the socket, there's a relatively large contact resistance between the plug and the socket. If the device begins to work in maximum consumption at once, the large current combining with the large contact resistance will product a large amount of heat at the contact point - thereby damaging the plug or socket. <br/></p>
<p>The maximum charging current for DreamCharger is 2A, which isn't exactly a small current. If the DreamCharger begins charging with such a large current at once, it may cause a similar failure. <br/></p>
<p>So we performed a little improvement through starting the charging <b>only</b> after a short period of detecting the charger, once the plug has been fully inserted. This can protect your port contactor from burn or damage, because of the excessively large current and contact resistance. </p>
<p><b>Output Protection: </b>This protection comes into effect from the moment which you connect the DreamCharger to load. The protection circuit will continue to monitor the output current of 5V/1A and 5.2V/2.4A ports, and will then limit the output current once it's detected that the output current is greater than 1A or 2.4A. The OLED screen will indicate which port is overloading or short circuiting. <br/></p>
<p>DreamCharger can then automatically restore output when you eliminate the overload or short circuit. This usually happens when you connect a large power consumption device into the 5V/1A port. This can be easily resolved by reconnecting the device to the 5.2V/2.4A port, which meets almost all of the specifications of handheld devices. </p>

<br/>
<p><b>Cell Voltage Protection:</b> This protection is commonly referred to as ""overcharge protection"" or ""overdischarge protection."" It could be dangerous when improper charging causes cell voltage to become too high. It could also cause damage to the cell when excessive discharging causes cell voltage to become too low, too. The cell voltage protection circuit ensures that cell voltage stays within the normal, allowable range, and cuts off the connection of cell and circuits immediately once it's detected that the voltage is out of range. <br/></p>
<p>The cell voltage will continue to rise by the charge procedure when you charge the DreamCharger. The internal charging circuit will control the cell voltage from exceeding 4.2V. The protection circuit will activate once it's detected that the cell voltage is higher than 4.35V, even if the charging circuit is failing.<br/></p>
<p>Conversely, the cell voltage will decrease when DreamCharger is discharging by the decrease of the remaining capacity. Normally, DreamCharger will stop discharging and indicate a ""too low remaining capacity"" message on the OLED screen, when the remaining capacity becomes too low. However, if the software crashes or other anomalies occur, leading to the automatic stop due to discharge failure, the protection circuit will immediately activate, when detecting that the cell voltage is lower than 2.3V. <br/></p>
<p><b>Cell Current Protection: </b>There has to be a certain limitation for the current flown into or out of the cell, otherwise danger may occur, and the cell could be damaged if this limit is exceeded. The cell current protection circuit will disconnect the battery and circuit immediately, once it's detected that excessive charging or discharging of the current occurs. </p>
<p>When charging the DreamCharger, charging circuit controls the current maximum of 2A. But even if the charging circuit fails, the protection circuit will disconnect the cell from the circuit once it's detected that the charging current has exceeded 3A. Conversely, the protection circuit will disconnect the cell from the circuit once it's detected that the discharging current exceeds 6A - especially when short circuits occur. <br/></p>
<p><b>Cell Temperature Protection:</b> There are different requirements of charging and discharging temperatures which are set by different types of battery chemistries, and manufacturing processes. Excessive temperatures can obviously be dangerous, and too low of temperatures may damage the cell. The cell temperature protection circuit will stop charging or discharging immediately once it's detected that the temperature of the cell is out of the allowable range. For the SANYO UR18650F, the temperature range for charging is 0℃ ~ 40℃ (32℉ ~ 104℉),
and for discharging is -20℃ ~ 60℃ (-4℉ ~ 140℉). The cell temperature protection circuit will continuously monitor the cell temperature, and will stop charging or discharging immediately once the temperature exceeds the allowable range, while also indicating a temperature message on the OLED screen. </p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> In some emergency situations, you may need the DreamCharger to work outside of the permitted temperature range. You can temporarily make the DreamCharger work outside the allowable range if necessary. However, we strongly recommend against this practice. The method of how to achieve this function will be indicated in the instruction manual. </p>

<br/>
<p><b>Charging Duration Protection: </b>The charging duration from empty to full will not exceed over 16 hours, when even connecting the DreamCharger to a standard USB 2.0 port (which only provides 500mA maximum current). The charging duration protection circuit will stop charging once the charging duration reaches approximately 26 hours if the charging circuit detects failure. Overcharging could cause danger. </p>
<p><b>Pressure Valve Protection: </b>This ultra-low level of protection is provided by the SANYO UR18650F itself. We know that explosions are caused instantly, and generate enormous pressure. The pressure valve of the 18650 Li-ion cell is typically designed in a  position near the positive electrode. Once the cell's internal pressure rises to a dangerous level, the pressure valve will then disconnect the positive electrode and release its internal pressure. It will permanently damage the cell once this protection is triggered, but can guarantee the cell from facing danger. SANYO UR18650F has the most stable quality of pressure valve on the market, and we couldn't find that this type of Li-ion cell had experienced any form of explosion or spontaneous combustion ever before. </p>

<p><b>Tip: </b>Although we've mentioned many types of protection, they can also be divided into hardware and software-levels of protection. Hardware-level protection has no need to rely on the software running. This means that even if the software crashes, the hardware-level protection will still be active. It's the most reliable form of protection. The software-level protection needs to rely on the software running, and will fail once the software crashes. All the types of protection listed above are hardware-level protection except the cell temperature protection. The cell temperature protection is a software-level protection. </p>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>
<p><b>1. </b>Q.) Why does the DreamCharger equip three battery cells, but not more or less?</p>
<p>A.) Less cells, like two, only have 5200mAh of design capacity, which seems to be too small. Conversely, more cells - like four (because it will have a larger design capacity) means that the larger dimensions and weight will take a longer time to charge to full. When considering these factors, we decided that it would be the more appropriate choice to equip the DreamCharger with three cells. </p>
<p><b>2. </b>Q.) Why not design the adapter inside of DreamCharger so that it can charge by being plugged directly into a wall socket?</p>
<p>A.) This would increase a lot of electrical components, especially the inclusion of a transformer - which would also greatly increase the dimensions and weight of the DreamCharger. It would have become very hot when the adapter circuit works, which may shorten the life of the battery cells. </p>
<p><b>3. </b>Q.) Why not design a LED flashlight on DreamCharger?</p>
<p>A.) A small size LED lamp leads to a low luminous. A high luminous LED lamp has a larger size, and a higher temperature when it works. This LED lamp may need a larger and more-complex cooling component, which can not be put into the DreamCharger. At present, most mobile phones also provide a flashlight function. So we thought that a low luminous flashlight isn't totally necessary. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>4. </b>Q.)<b> </b>Why does the DreamCharger not have a short movie?</p>
<p>A.)<b> </b>Since
 we've already exceeded our budget and costs associated with developing 
the DreamCharger, we've decided that it's too expensive to make a short 
movie for the DreamCharger. We're saving this money, and we instead find
 it more appropriate to use the majority of our funds on creating 
high-quality molds and components. We will eventually add a simple video
 to our YouTube, so please keep an eye on our channel.</p>
<p><b>5. </b>Q.)<b> </b>Why do some details of the DreamCharger in some of the pictures not look clear enough?</p>
<p>A.)<b> </b>That's
 because almost all of the DreamCharger's pictures are taken of our one 
and only prototype. Rather than using 3D software rendered pictures, we 
wanted to keep the DreamCharger's appearance more realistic. The actual 
appearance of the DreamCharger in future production will appear much 
better than the pictures shown in this campaign. </p>
<p><b>6. </b>Q.)<b> </b>Why are there no words or patterns printed on the DreamCharger's shell?</p>
<p>A.)<b> </b>This
 is only a prototype. We will print our logo, the specifications and a 
lot of other information on DreamCharger's shell once the time comes for
 mass production. In fact, there will be a complete product package when
 we mail them to our customers. The package will include the cable, 
instruction manual, packaging materials and so on. </p>
<p><b>7. </b>Q.)<b> </b>How many DreamChargers should I buy to be able to customize my own logo?<br/></p>
<p>A.)<b> </b>You
 just need to purchase one DreamCharger in this campaign to be able to 
customize your own logo for display on it. Or, if you purchase five or 
more DreamChargers at one time, your logo that you design will be added 
for free. You'll just need to send us the picture of the logo. In the 
future, we will require a minimum order quantity for logo customization.

</div></div>","The DreamCharger Story
 
DreamCharger is the world's newest, most innovative and greatest mobile power source that has been under research, design and development throughout the past year.  

The DreamCharger carries its name because it's not only a fantastic mobile power source, but also a dream for our future customers and ourselves. 
 We truly need your help with reading and sharing our campaign, and making a small contribution - in order for us to realize this dream. 
If you can't contribute with money - that's okay! Please use this campaign to learn more about the world of mobile power generation, and what we can offer good people like yourself. Spread the word about our campaign to your family and friends. 
 One year of research and design has gone towards mastering the intense details that the perfect mobile power source should promote. Our charger is a result of this effort. 
 
From displaying the remaining charge & discharge times, to utilizing dual-USB output ports for you and a friend to charge multiple devices simultaneously - the DreamCharger is a product that people of modern populations throughout the world need. 
Imagine knowing the exact durations of time that your DreamCharger will require to discharge to empty, and charge until full. These unique features of the DreamCharger will save you loads of time, money and energy when you can't afford to miss a moment of your extremely busy life. 
Having the precise charge & discharge details displayed directly on your DreamCharger's OLED panel will keep you consistently informed as to how much power your DreamCharger contains at all times - for the times that you need to charge your smartphone the most. We're setting you up with ALL of the information and powerful charging capabilities that you'll ever need to continue using your smartphone and tablet 24/7 for business, fun and your personal life. 
Never experience your smartphone or tablet ""dying"" ever again. Don't miss out on all of the potential that your electronic devices provide you with. You won't have to miss a single moment of life ever again when using the DreamCharger.  

The Impact Smartphones. iPads. Tablets. They're essential pieces of our high-tech lifestyles. People everywhere are now relying on mobile power more than ever before.
But have you ever been in a situation when you needed immediate access to an electrical outlet, yet you couldn't find one? Maybe you were expecting an important phone call from someone, and then saw that your smartphone's battery was low. Or, maybe you occasionally forget to fully-charge your favorite tablet before leaving the house. 
No one can afford to miss an important phone call, or struggle with using an iPad that has just 7% battery-life remaining.. 
Many of us run into these situations multiple times per week, if not each day. We've all been in these predicaments. 
And our team is here to solve these issues before they happen. But we're doing more than just that. We're solving the 
problems that come with lacking access to mobile power - but we're also doing it in a beautiful way. 
Here's what our team, and the DreamCharger will provide you with: 
Sharp Appearance
 
We offer a powerful, great-looking, and comfortably-held mobile charger. Our prototype is complete, and it looks amazing. With the DreamCharger, you'll be able to charge your mobile devices with serious power - AND you'll be able to do so in style.  
The DreamCharger displays information through an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) panel, which is hidden under a mirror-like cover. When the OLED isn't displaying information, you won't even see it. This adds a hint of mystique to the DreamCharger's image. The surface of the DreamCharger is painted with a UV (ultraviolet) coat which appears gorgeous, smooth and wear-resistant. 


Each of the four corners of the DreamCharger are also arcuated, which makes it very gentle on the hands, and extremely comfortable to hold. The thickness of the plastic shell has also been expanded to 2mm, adding to the overall appeal, strength and comfort of our charger. It's unheard of for technology this powerful to fit so comfortably within the palm of your hand, and look this good. You have to see and feel the DreamCharger for yourself to believe it. Once you use the DreamCharger just once - you'll never leave your home without one again. Whether you decide to keep one in your pocket, bag or purse, there will be days when you absolutely need to use your DreamCharger. 



Impressive Batteries

The heart and lungs of our device consists of its three impressive battery cells. The battery cells make up the primary source of energy for the internal circuit, and also provide the output power for your personal high-tech electronic devices. 
The DreamCharger uses the commonly known 18650 cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. Most laptops actually use these types of batteries. Therefore, they're some of the most mature and reliable batteries on the market. After testing all of the 18650 battery cells on the market, our team decided to utilize the SANYO UR18650F, which is a world-class battery cell with light-blue insulation rings, and red tubes. The advantages of our batteries include utilizing an ultra-high discharge plateau - which provides a better conversion efficiency for the internal boost converter circuit. The batteries also have a low internal resistance of less than 45 milliohms, which increases discharging efficiency, and reduces the overall heat that's generated.  This low self-discharge rate will preserve most initial energy when it's not in use. 

Our batteries offer a longer service life: meaning that more than 80% of the design capacity is reserved after 300+ charge/discharge cycles. The batteries are completely safe and secure. We've minimized the risk of explosion and spontaneous combustion. We've never experienced such an accident, nor have any accidents with the cells been reported so far. The typical capacity of a single SANYO UR18650F is 2600mAh. We've equipped the DreamCharger with three of these cells, equaling a total capacity of 7800mAh. 

Dimensions & Weight

The battery pack's total dimensions are 54mm x 65mm x 18mm. Our three battery cells weigh a total of 141g. After minimizing the overall design as much as possible (down to the millimeter) we've achieved a total size of 67.6mm x 104mm x 22.7mm for the DreamCharger. 
The overall size of the DreamCharger is only 39mm longer, 13.6mm wider, and 4.7mm thicker than its battery pack (approximately as big as two iPhone 4s'). The overall weight of the DreamCharger is 198g, or 57g heavier than the battery pack. 

We could have reduced the overall weight even more by minimizing the thickness of the plastic shell, but we didn't want to compromise the DreamCharger's strength & durability. Beyond the miniscule details - the DreamCharger is extremely lightweight for the power that it provides electronic devices with.   





Output Capacity

As mobile devices become bigger, faster and stronger - internal battery capacities must also increase as a result of this. More power is needed from external supplies to generate more powerful devices. 
It has now even become commonplace for people to leave the house with multiple electronic devices. You may need to charge a smartphone and a tablet device at the same time, or share charging capabilities with a friend (be your friend's hero). Based on all of this, we've designed two standard (Type-A) USB output ports for the DreamCharger. 

One of our ports is a low power output port, providing 5V, 1A maximum output, which can charge almost all mobile phones. 
The other port is a high power output port, providing 5.2V, 2.4A maximum output, which can charge both mobile phones, and the latest pads/tablets. 

The most powerful adapter that Apple equips the iPad with is a 5.2V/2.4A/12Watt adapter. Our high power output port is designed with this specification in mind, and is fully compatible with Apple's recognition standard. Therefore, all iPhones and iPads can be charged at their maximum current by using this port. 




Efficiency

Higher efficiency means more energy output, and lower generated heat. A typical lithium-ion battery is 2.7V to 4.2V. To get between 5V and 5.2V output voltage, it needs the help of a boost converter circuit. Most mobile power chargers use non-synchronous boost circuits, which means a lower cost, and a lower conversion efficiency (at around 80%). We didn't want to go down this low-quality route. We needed to achieve high-quality, and a high current output, in order to maximize efficiency, and to reduce the overall heat that is generated through our charger. 
The DreamCharger utilizes a synchronous boost circuit, setting the average conversion efficiency at different loads ranging up to, or even higher than 90%. 

Automatic Recognition Adapters  
The charging current is typically set at a fixed rate for general mobile power. But sometimes, problems can occur because of this. Connecting mobile power to a computer's USB 2.0 port (to charge a device) can trigger protection of the computer, and even possibly damage the USB port. This happens because standard USB 2.0 ports on computers can only provide 0.5A maximum output current. To solve this, we've added an ""automatic recognition circuit"" to the DreamCharger. So when DreamCharger connects to an adapter, it will automatically identify one of the three generic, main types of chargers. The DreamCharger will then limit the current drawn from the corresponding charger type, preventing hazards from occurring.


User Interface - Working Status Indicator


DreamCharger uses a 0.96inch, 128 x 64 dot-matrix white light OLED panel.OLED provides many benefits such as self-luminous, high contrast, high viewing angle, high temperature stability and more. This provides the DreamCharger with an excellent display. All of the information that the DreamCharger provides you with is displayed through text or icons in this OLED panel. The OLED panel vividly displays the working status of DreamCharger in four modes: standing by, discharging, charging or charge over. If the DreamCharger enters protection operation mode, it will indicate: temp too high, temp too low, or overload. This protection function is considered to be the most comprehensive aspect of the DreamCharger. 



User Interface - Remaining Capacity Indicator


Currently, almost all mobile power sources have to ""guess"" the remaining capacity by detecting their batteries' voltage levels. The problem with this method of guessing remaining capacities is that battery voltage may change based on different ranges of load. Therefore, this is nothing less than indicating the remaining capacity through LED's. 
Voltage of an empty battery will even increase after releasing for some time. This will show that there is a LED lighting, but the mobile power shuts down, once connected to a load. Again, this isn't an accurate method of calculation. 
Through our continuous efforts, the accuracy of detecting the remaining capacity of the DreamCharger reaches an incredible 1mAh.  Meanwhile, the remaining percentage is up to 1%, and is shown by both the battery icon and Arabic numbers. 
The more accurate our remaining capacity indicator is, the better you can take advantage of the DreamCharger. 


User Interface - Remaining Time for Charging and Discharging

When you use a mobile power charger for your electronic devices, you want to see accurate charging data. This is what keeps you from encountering possible unfortunate situations. Being aware of your real-time charging & discharging information at all times is about preventing bad outcomes from happening. It's about taking control. You want to know the exact duration it will take for your DreamCharger to discharge to empty, and the duration of time that DreamCharger will need to be charged to full. 
The benefit of 1mAh accurate precision is that if we simultaneously monitor the current flow into or out of the battery pack, we can get the remaining charge time to full, or discharge to empty. We calculate these precise figures by using simple division: Remaining capacity (mAh) ÷ current. For example - when using the DreamCharger to charge a pad, assuming that the remaining capacity is full (7800mAh), and the current flowing out from the battery pack is 2000mA, the remaining time = 7800mAh÷2000mA = 3.9 hours. Similarly, when we charge the DreamCharger, assuming the remaining capacity is empty (0 mAh), and the current flowing into the battery pack is 1500mA, then the remaining time = (7800mAh - 0mAh) ÷ 1500mA = 5.2 hours. It's not too complex. DreamCharger can calculate these times with accuracy up to 1 minute, and will indicate these figures on-screen, automatically. 
To go a little deeper, in order to prevent the current from jumping, the current is averaged. Thus, DreamCharger will take a few seconds to average the current at the initial stage of charging or discharging. The more stable the current, the more accurately the remaining time can be calculated for you.


User Interface - Battery Pack Status Monitor 

When you're driving a car, sometimes you may check your engine's temperature, your speed, and so on. This is all of the important information that is indicative of the health of your automobile. 
DreamCharger provides an interface similar to this - but instead monitors your battery pack, cell temperature, remaining capacity, voltage, and current flown into or out. You can think of it as the automobile of your electronics. We also show the voltage's current value shown by the bar icon. 
You can check the current and voltage VS maximum and minimum in the form of a simple ratio. For SANYO UR18650F (which the DreamCharger currently uses) the voltage 3V corresponds with an empty bar, while 4.2V corresponds with a full bar. For the current bar, 0A corresponds with an empty bar, and 5A corresponds with full when discharging, or 2A corresponds with full when charging. 
Tip: When charging your devices, you can roughly estimate the current flowing out of the USB port. The formula is simple: battery voltage × battery current × 90% ÷ 5V (when using 5V/1A output port, or 5.2V when using 5.2V/2.4A port). ""90%"" is the average efficiency of the internal boost circuit. 








User Interface - Advanced Information

With the increase of battery charge-discharge cycles, the full-charge capacity of the battery will decrease, due to the process of Li-ion. In the advanced information screen, you can not only check the charge-discharge cycle number, but also the full-charge capacity. You can roughly determine the health of the battery pack through these two variables. 
Nowadays, when you travel by air or another form of transportation, security personnel may check the design capacity and other information of your mobile power - and only compliant ones can be taken. 
We mark the design capacity of the battery pack, battery manufacturer/model, chemical type of the battery, production date, serial number and so on. Some information will simultaneously be indicated on the shell too. 





Operation - The Simpler, The Better


While it seems as if the DreamCharger has a rich functionality and information indicator screen, it's actually very easy to use our device. This provides you with a winning product that packs high-power and a soft learning curve. 
We designed only one recoil-slide switch for DreamCharger as a power and function switch, considering that when you put a mobile power device in your bag or pocket, a push-switch may cause a malfunction trigger more easily. 

How to Discharge: The only thing you need to do is connect your device to the DreamCharger, and then short-slide the switch until DreamCharger is turned on. When the discharge is over (when your devices have been charged to 'full'), you'll have no need to manually turn off the DreamCharger. It will shut down automatically after 30 seconds, once detecting the end of the discharge.How to Charge: When you want to charge the DreamCharger, simply connect an adapter to the charge port of DreamCharger. It will automatically turn on, begin to charge, and then automatically stop when charged to full.In fact - you can charge the DreamCharger at anytime that you like. However the DreamCharger cannot be charged when being discharged simultaneously. DreamCharger would then stop discharging, and change its status to charging preferentially. 
Switching Between Different Screens: Simply short-slide, or slide and hold for one second, then release. All screens can be switched by using this method. 

Low Self-Discharge - More Capacity Can be Maintained for Longer Periods of Time
Self-discharge comes from two aspects: one is battery self-discharge, and the other is the leakage current from the internal circuit, when it shuts down. SANYO UR18650F batteries (which the DreamCharger equips) has a very low self-discharge rate. 
What we have to do is minimize the leakage current when shutting down. Through our continued exploration and testing, the leakage current is reduced to less than 1uA (0.001mA). Benefiting from these two aspects, the remaining capacity can be maintained for a long time, even if you don't use the DreamCharger for a long period of time. 


Security - The Most Important Aspect of Mobile Power
Lithium is a highly reactive chemical compound, and the protection of the DreamCharger's batteries is highly important. We've placed security as a top priority from the very beginning of the DreamCharger project. Overall, the security aspect of DreamCharger can be divided into two categories of protection. The first category of protection is the high level of input/output protection. 
This includes input voltage/current protection, output current protection, and delayed start of charging protection. This is a conventional protection. 
The second category is the low level of comprehensive protection for batteries, including better voltage/current protection, thermal protection, and charge-time protection. This level of protection generally isn't necessary unless the DreamCharger malfunctions. 
 Of course, if all protection fails, there's a primitive layer of protection which the SANYO UR18650F itself provides. 
Input Protection: This protection will come into effect from the very moment that you connect a charger to the DreamCharger. The protection circuit will continue to detect the input voltage, then stop charging immediately, and disconnect the external charger once it's detected that the input voltage is higher than 6V. When you plug a damaged charger into the DreamCharger, this situation could occur.
The ""automatic recognition circuit"" that we've mentioned above can also be considered a form of input protection. DreamCharger will determine the type of charger that you connect to, and will then control the maximum input current, in order to protect the external adapter from being damaged. 
Delayed Start of Charging Protection: We can say that we're the first group of innovators in history to add this form of protection to mobile power. Many people may recognize the experience of the moment that you plug certain household appliances into a wall socket, and you see sparks appear. This happens because, in the absence of the plug being fully inserted into the socket, there's a relatively large contact resistance between the plug and the socket. If the device begins to work in maximum consumption at once, the large current combining with the large contact resistance will product a large amount of heat at the contact point - thereby damaging the plug or socket. 
The maximum charging current for DreamCharger is 2A, which isn't exactly a small current. If the DreamCharger begins charging with such a large current at once, it may cause a similar failure. 
So we performed a little improvement through starting the charging only after a short period of detecting the charger, once the plug has been fully inserted. This can protect your port contactor from burn or damage, because of the excessively large current and contact resistance. 
Output Protection: This protection comes into effect from the moment which you connect the DreamCharger to load. The protection circuit will continue to monitor the output current of 5V/1A and 5.2V/2.4A ports, and will then limit the output current once it's detected that the output current is greater than 1A or 2.4A. The OLED screen will indicate which port is overloading or short circuiting. 
DreamCharger can then automatically restore output when you eliminate the overload or short circuit. This usually happens when you connect a large power consumption device into the 5V/1A port. This can be easily resolved by reconnecting the device to the 5.2V/2.4A port, which meets almost all of the specifications of handheld devices. 






Cell Voltage Protection: This protection is commonly referred to as ""overcharge protection"" or ""overdischarge protection."" It could be dangerous when improper charging causes cell voltage to become too high. It could also cause damage to the cell when excessive discharging causes cell voltage to become too low, too. The cell voltage protection circuit ensures that cell voltage stays within the normal, allowable range, and cuts off the connection of cell and circuits immediately once it's detected that the voltage is out of range. 
The cell voltage will continue to rise by the charge procedure when you charge the DreamCharger. The internal charging circuit will control the cell voltage from exceeding 4.2V. The protection circuit will activate once it's detected that the cell voltage is higher than 4.35V, even if the charging circuit is failing.
Conversely, the cell voltage will decrease when DreamCharger is discharging by the decrease of the remaining capacity. Normally, DreamCharger will stop discharging and indicate a ""too low remaining capacity"" message on the OLED screen, when the remaining capacity becomes too low. However, if the software crashes or other anomalies occur, leading to the automatic stop due to discharge failure, the protection circuit will immediately activate, when detecting that the cell voltage is lower than 2.3V. 
Cell Current Protection: There has to be a certain limitation for the current flown into or out of the cell, otherwise danger may occur, and the cell could be damaged if this limit is exceeded. The cell current protection circuit will disconnect the battery and circuit immediately, once it's detected that excessive charging or discharging of the current occurs. 
When charging the DreamCharger, charging circuit controls the current maximum of 2A. But even if the charging circuit fails, the protection circuit will disconnect the cell from the circuit once it's detected that the charging current has exceeded 3A. Conversely, the protection circuit will disconnect the cell from the circuit once it's detected that the discharging current exceeds 6A - especially when short circuits occur. 
Cell Temperature Protection: There are different requirements of charging and discharging temperatures which are set by different types of battery chemistries, and manufacturing processes. Excessive temperatures can obviously be dangerous, and too low of temperatures may damage the cell. The cell temperature protection circuit will stop charging or discharging immediately once it's detected that the temperature of the cell is out of the allowable range. For the SANYO UR18650F, the temperature range for charging is 0℃ ~ 40℃ (32℉ ~ 104℉),
and for discharging is -20℃ ~ 60℃ (-4℉ ~ 140℉). The cell temperature protection circuit will continuously monitor the cell temperature, and will stop charging or discharging immediately once the temperature exceeds the allowable range, while also indicating a temperature message on the OLED screen. 
Tip: In some emergency situations, you may need the DreamCharger to work outside of the permitted temperature range. You can temporarily make the DreamCharger work outside the allowable range if necessary. However, we strongly recommend against this practice. The method of how to achieve this function will be indicated in the instruction manual. 





Charging Duration Protection: The charging duration from empty to full will not exceed over 16 hours, when even connecting the DreamCharger to a standard USB 2.0 port (which only provides 500mA maximum current). The charging duration protection circuit will stop charging once the charging duration reaches approximately 26 hours if the charging circuit detects failure. Overcharging could cause danger. 
Pressure Valve Protection: This ultra-low level of protection is provided by the SANYO UR18650F itself. We know that explosions are caused instantly, and generate enormous pressure. The pressure valve of the 18650 Li-ion cell is typically designed in a  position near the positive electrode. Once the cell's internal pressure rises to a dangerous level, the pressure valve will then disconnect the positive electrode and release its internal pressure. It will permanently damage the cell once this protection is triggered, but can guarantee the cell from facing danger. SANYO UR18650F has the most stable quality of pressure valve on the market, and we couldn't find that this type of Li-ion cell had experienced any form of explosion or spontaneous combustion ever before. 



Tip: Although we've mentioned many types of protection, they can also be divided into hardware and software-levels of protection. Hardware-level protection has no need to rely on the software running. This means that even if the software crashes, the hardware-level protection will still be active. It's the most reliable form of protection. The software-level protection needs to rely on the software running, and will fail once the software crashes. All the types of protection listed above are hardware-level protection except the cell temperature protection. The cell temperature protection is a software-level protection.

FAQ:
1. Q.) Why does the DreamCharger equip three battery cells, but not more or less?
A.) Less cells, like two, only have 5200mAh of design capacity, which seems to be too small. Conversely, more cells - like four (because it will have a larger design capacity) means that the larger dimensions and weight will take a longer time to charge to full. When considering these factors, we decided that it would be the more appropriate choice to equip the DreamCharger with three cells. 
2. Q.) Why not design the adapter inside of DreamCharger so that it can charge by being plugged directly into a wall socket?
A.) This would increase a lot of electrical components, especially the inclusion of a transformer - which would also greatly increase the dimensions and weight of the DreamCharger. It would have become very hot when the adapter circuit works, which may shorten the life of the battery cells. 
3. Q.) Why not design a LED flashlight on DreamCharger?
A.) A small size LED lamp leads to a low luminous. A high luminous LED lamp has a larger size, and a higher temperature when it works. This LED lamp may need a larger and more-complex cooling component, which can not be put into the DreamCharger. At present, most mobile phones also provide a flashlight function. So we thought that a low luminous flashlight isn't totally necessary. 

4. Q.) Why does the DreamCharger not have a short movie?
A.) Since
 we've already exceeded our budget and costs associated with developing 
the DreamCharger, we've decided that it's too expensive to make a short 
movie for the DreamCharger. We're saving this money, and we instead find
 it more appropriate to use the majority of our funds on creating 
high-quality molds and components. We will eventually add a simple video
 to our YouTube, so please keep an eye on our channel.
5. Q.) Why do some details of the DreamCharger in some of the pictures not look clear enough?
A.) That's
 because almost all of the DreamCharger's pictures are taken of our one 
and only prototype. Rather than using 3D software rendered pictures, we 
wanted to keep the DreamCharger's appearance more realistic. The actual 
appearance of the DreamCharger in future production will appear much 
better than the pictures shown in this campaign. 
6. Q.) Why are there no words or patterns printed on the DreamCharger's shell?
A.) This
 is only a prototype. We will print our logo, the specifications and a 
lot of other information on DreamCharger's shell once the time comes for
 mass production. In fact, there will be a complete product package when
 we mail them to our customers. The package will include the cable, 
instruction manual, packaging materials and so on. 
7. Q.) How many DreamChargers should I buy to be able to customize my own logo?
A.) You
 just need to purchase one DreamCharger in this campaign to be able to 
customize your own logo for display on it. Or, if you purchase five or 
more DreamChargers at one time, your logo that you design will be added 
for free. You'll just need to send us the picture of the logo. In the 
future, we will require a minimum order quantity for logo customization.

slowly moved up on to lead the team of web designers in the company. It was
till July 2014 when I decided to move on
and start working independently and part ways with ""Mavrick Software and
Telecom Service"".</p>
<p>Since then I have been freelancing and till date have worked
for 1700+ hours on successfully completed projects and that can be seen on my Elance and Upwork

<p>Personally I prefers most to work mainly on web based

</div></div>","About the ProjectThis is a project created focusing on the persons willing to learn website design but are confused of where to start and not getting enough resources anywhere and are feeling lost.
The project will basically be a guide for an individual on how to become a website designer. Also, he/she does not need to have any prior knowledge of design or Photoshop, only willingness and dedication would be enough.During this project, I will be creating a video series totally focused on designing websites by using Photoshop. The video series will be distributed into a certain amount of videos. These videos will include introductory lessons on Photoshop and also instructions on detailed use of some Photoshop tools used to design a website. Along with that the video series will also include videos where I would be designing 5 industry standard websites and would be explaining and showing how we can achieve the results and be capable of creating similar designs.The best part, once the full video series is completed, it will than be uploaded on YouTube and would be made public so that whoever is looking for learning videos related to website designing today or in future, he/she would be able to make use of the videos and help take their first step to become an awesome website designer.   Breakdown of the Video Series





On the first 7 videos (Approximately) we will be discussing and learning about the following:

Brief discussion about web design
Get to know the Photoshop interface

<h2 style=""color: #22b6b8;"">Improve your life with Whemsy. </h2>
<p>Improving your life isn’t a small feat - but that doesn’t mean you should spend hours searching the internet for ineffective ways to do it. We think you should do it your way, in your own time - with an app that you can rely on.</p>
<p>Whemsy is a new startup that helps you to do exactly that - it’s lets you improve your life, one task at a time. Whemsy takes advantage of the technology we have in the 21st century to completely change the way you handle your habits and goals. We already have an Android and iOS app - and now it’s time for us to expand.</p>
<p>Whemsy features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A huge library of habits and goals to deploy in your life - there are truly dozens of brilliant goals and more are added each day.</li>
<li>Social motivation and social interaction - Whemsy is focussed on your friends. You can provide and receive motivation for your goals, it’s just so easy.</li>
<li>Your life, played like a game - Whemsy features game-like properties, making achieving your goals easier - and much more rewarding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-improvement just isn't working in this day and age - and we believe that Whemsy is the best solution to solve this.</p>
<h2 style=""color: #22b6b8;"">The key to reaching goals is taking actions</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/120300/files/20131008045042-goal.png?1381233042"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Being a productivity lecturer, I saw just how excited people became at the thought of improving their lives - but excitement just wasn’t enough to make a truly lasting change.</p>
<p>So - it was in my blood to take action, and that is exactly what Whemsy helps you to do. Whemsy is a life-management application built to handle routines, tasks and habits in a beautiful way. Our innovative application puts forward a set of tasks that must be accomplished in-order to reach your goal.</p>
<p>Fun fact:<br/>
We believe that goals are split into 5 categories: (W)ealth, (H)ealth, (E)motion, (M)ind and (S)ocial achievements.</p>
<h2 style=""color: #22b6b8;"">Souround your actions with friends</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/120303/files/20131008045109-friends.png?1381233069"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our friends give us motivation for great things - things that can push us to be better people, to ourselves and to the people around us - Whemsy takes this a step further - giving you a place to host new ventures, and your friends a place to send you motivation wherever they are.</p>
<p>The truth is: Whemsy is most effective when your friends are on the network - but that doesn’t mean you can’t be a lone-wolf. Absolutely anyone from around the world can give you motivation for anything, big or small. Support from real human beings can mean so much more than doing it alone, and making changes can be a lot easier.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/120293/files/20131008044322-comment2.png?1381232602"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We’re collecting advice from the people that matter the most - our users. We are a crowdsourced encyclopedia of life-improvement tips and a place that everyone can contribute towards. Each habit you strive towards features inspirations, tips and other ideas that users from all over the world can add to, it’s social... taken to a whole new level. Everyone is sharing their ideas, so why not share yours?</p>
<h2 style=""color: #22b6b8;"">Your path, your choices. It’s your life afterall</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/120333/files/20131008050232-path2.png?1381233752"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are all different, full stop - and that’s why Whemsy has been designed to cater for everyone. Whemsy puts your life into a higher gear, giving you freedom to alter and change the course of the actions you take.</p>
<h2 style=""color: #22b6b8;"">If life is a game, shouldn’t Whemsy be too?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/120336/files/20131008050343-improve-indie.png?1381233823"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You’ve heard the phrase ‘life is just a game’; and so is Whemsy. Actually, it’s slightly more complicated than that. We try to beat our highscores and we constantly try until we beat the game... and that’s why Whemsy’s points system is so effective. You can earn achievements, unlock challenges, win awards, take on missions and view secret tips - this truly is a game of life.</p>
<h2 style=""color: #22b6b8;"">So, what is Whemsy?</h2>
<p>Good question. This is how Whemsy works:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/120309/files/20131008045228-phones-with-text.png?1381233148"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Read</b> suggestions from users from all around the world on how to combat specific tasks - hundreds of minds are better than one, right?</li>
<li>
<b>Take action</b> by deploying the voices of friends, family and Whemsy users to achieve your goal - receive new comments and push yourself a little bit further.</li>
<li>
<b>Check your progress.</b> Find out what areas you need to focus upon and push forward to reach the final stretch of your goal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""color: #22b6b8;"">Whemsy - everywhere, all the time</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/120343/files/20131008050628-Devices2.png?1381233988"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Whemsy will be free - that’s one thing we decided on day one. We take privacy seriously, too. We won’t sell data about your passion for classical music. We won’t show ads and your data will be accessible in three places: on Android, iPhone and on the web.</p>
<p>Funding will allow us to create a web app - to go alongside our Android and iOS app that launched on July 4th 2013 and the 21st of December 2012 respectively - the day the world ended for some, but started for us.</p>

Improving your life isn’t a small feat - but that doesn’t mean you should spend hours searching the internet for ineffective ways to do it. We think you should do it your way, in your own time - with an app that you can rely on.
Whemsy is a new startup that helps you to do exactly that - it’s lets you improve your life, one task at a time. Whemsy takes advantage of the technology we have in the 21st century to completely change the way you handle your habits and goals. We already have an Android and iOS app - and now it’s time for us to expand.
Whemsy features:

A huge library of habits and goals to deploy in your life - there are truly dozens of brilliant goals and more are added each day.
Social motivation and social interaction - Whemsy is focussed on your friends. You can provide and receive motivation for your goals, it’s just so easy.
Your life, played like a game - Whemsy features game-like properties, making achieving your goals easier - and much more rewarding.

Self-improvement just isn't working in this day and age - and we believe that Whemsy is the best solution to solve this.
The key to reaching goals is taking actions

Being a productivity lecturer, I saw just how excited people became at the thought of improving their lives - but excitement just wasn’t enough to make a truly lasting change.
So - it was in my blood to take action, and that is exactly what Whemsy helps you to do. Whemsy is a life-management application built to handle routines, tasks and habits in a beautiful way. Our innovative application puts forward a set of tasks that must be accomplished in-order to reach your goal.
Fun fact:
We believe that goals are split into 5 categories: (W)ealth, (H)ealth, (E)motion, (M)ind and (S)ocial achievements.
Souround your actions with friends

Our friends give us motivation for great things - things that can push us to be better people, to ourselves and to the people around us - Whemsy takes this a step further - giving you a place to host new ventures, and your friends a place to send you motivation wherever they are.
The truth is: Whemsy is most effective when your friends are on the network - but that doesn’t mean you can’t be a lone-wolf. Absolutely anyone from around the world can give you motivation for anything, big or small. Support from real human beings can mean so much more than doing it alone, and making changes can be a lot easier.

Whemsy+Encyclopedia = Whemsypedia

We’re collecting advice from the people that matter the most - our users. We are a crowdsourced encyclopedia of life-improvement tips and a place that everyone can contribute towards. Each habit you strive towards features inspirations, tips and other ideas that users from all over the world can add to, it’s social... taken to a whole new level. Everyone is sharing their ideas, so why not share yours?
Your path, your choices. It’s your life afterall

We are all different, full stop - and that’s why Whemsy has been designed to cater for everyone. Whemsy puts your life into a higher gear, giving you freedom to alter and change the course of the actions you take.
If life is a game, shouldn’t Whemsy be too?

You’ve heard the phrase ‘life is just a game’; and so is Whemsy. Actually, it’s slightly more complicated than that. We try to beat our highscores and we constantly try until we beat the game... and that’s why Whemsy’s points system is so effective. You can earn achievements, unlock challenges, win awards, take on missions and view secret tips - this truly is a game of life.
So, what is Whemsy?
Good question. This is how Whemsy works:



Read suggestions from users from all around the world on how to combat specific tasks - hundreds of minds are better than one, right?

Take action by deploying the voices of friends, family and Whemsy users to achieve your goal - receive new comments and push yourself a little bit further.

Check your progress. Find out what areas you need to focus upon and push forward to reach the final stretch of your goal.

Whemsy - everywhere, all the time

Whemsy will be free - that’s one thing we decided on day one. We take privacy seriously, too. We won’t sell data about your passion for classical music. We won’t show ads and your data will be accessible in three places: on Android, iPhone and on the web.
Funding will allow us to create a web app - to go alongside our Android and iOS app that launched on July 4th 2013 and the 21st of December 2012 respectively - the day the world ended for some, but started for us.
So here’s the problem...
We are growing - but like any startup, funding is required to take the next big leap. We saved, but it takes much more than that to launch an app, let alone a platform. We can’t stay in a simple state and expect to grow at the rate we want to - so we ask you to help us - to bring our passion and development skills into Whemsy, and we know we can deliver something beautiful and something innovative.

<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">Will my product look like the video and photos?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> This is a working prototype to show what we have accomplished. The crowdfunding will go towards a <strong>custom printed circuit board, better connectors and components, and overall superior design</strong>. The case depicted is the identical one and we list the exterior dimensions below in the details. Please keep in mind that this project is aimed at basic model rocketry out on a Sunday with kids using A-E engines. It is not for the HPR community.<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mobilemissioncontrol.com/indiegogo/BlueNose4.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">Why BlueNose Mobile Mission Control (MMC)?</span></strong></p>
<p>Model rocketry is a lot of fun, but let's face it - the launch process is a little antiquated. Who amongst us hasn't cursed those shiny little alligator clips that barely hang on, except when they're trying desparately to touch each other? And every amateur rocketeer knows the frustration of performing a countdown, pressing down the safety key, holding your breath, and jamming the launch button only to have <strong>nothing happen</strong>.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mobilemissioncontrol.com/indiegogo/BlueNose12.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Imagine this instead. You open the missile cover on your <strong><span style=""color: red;"">Mobile Mission Control (MMC)</span></strong> and flip the toggle switch. The app on your phone immediately recognizes the launch module and activates the control interface. You connect to the igniter using the supplied professional hook clips. They grab on, don't let go, and are fully insulated to prevent short circuits. You plug the cable into the MMC and your smartphone shows you the wiring status. Almost always, that status is Good to Go. But if the igniter was split or squashed when that little plug went in, you know immediately. Status lights on the launcher and an alert in the app tell you whether a short circuit or open circuit would have delayed your launch.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mobilemissioncontrol.com/indiegogo/BlueNose11.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Then you perform your countdown and touch the button. Inside that little box, a sophisticated four-wire sensing circuit is activated to deliver a precision controlled launch current, and with a sharp whoosh, your rocket disappears into the sky. The launch times you see in the video are the real thing. You press the button and it launches immediately.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">Why back us?</span></strong></p>
<p>Model rockets are great for people of all ages. They are fun to build and even more fun to launch! We are passionate about model rocketry and technology, and we want to bring them together to help take the hobby to the next level.</p>
<p>Improving your launches is just the beginning. With your support, we can reach our stretch goals and achieve integrated telemetry. An embedded altimeter and accelerometer will let you log and wirelessly transmit flight metrics such as acceleration, flight time, height, speed and so on. One more wireless hop and your adventures are shared with friends and competitors online. Have a look at our stretch goals below, especially #2 and #3.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy;""> </span></strong></p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mobilemissioncontrol.com/indiegogo/BlueNose8.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">This IS rocket science!</span></strong></p>
<p>Lighting some powder on fire in a cardboard tube to launch a rocket is a pretty simple idea. Doing it efficiently and reliably, however, does require a bit of finesse.</p>
<p>Did you know that the launchers from that big rocket company work by short circuiting your expensive batteries across the igniter?</p>
<p>The MMC fires the igniter under precision microcontroller supervision. Which means you get a strong current for a rapid positive ignition without treating your batteries harshly (so they last longer) and also ensuring that the igniter will glow a nice bright orange for the duration of the ignition, but won't be overdriven and burn out prematurely. </p>
<p>We increasingly live in an untethered world. And let's face it - remote control is fun! We feel that <strong><span>Bluetooth Low Energy</span></strong> (BLE) is the perfect choice. Not only because the range and security work so well for wireless launching. The exremely low power requirements and minimal payload impact make BLE suitable for communicating that crucial launch data that you want to see and share. </p>
<p>While it's not in scope for right now, the design of the launcher takes into consideration the requirements of multi-engine rockets, and simulataneous launches of multiple rockets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img align=""left"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mobilemissioncontrol.com/indiegogo/BlueNose3.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">App</span></strong></p>
<p>With the base project funding goal, we will be releasing an <strong>iPhone</strong> app. We have this working in our proof of concept trials communicating over Bluetooth Low Energy. The app will be used to wirelessly trigger the launcher to ignite the model rocket motor engine by sending a burst of power to the igniter. The iPhone must be running iOS 6 or later. We can support any iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad that has BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). In the case of iPhones, that means iPhone 4S or better.</p>
<p>Should we reach a higher funding level (stretch goal #1) per the details below, we will be able to develop an Android app as well. We have Android app development experience and know we can do this.</p>
<p>But the real adventure starts with stretch goals #2 and #3. A tiny sensor module, attached to the nose cone of the rocket, will capture real time flight data: acceleration, altitude, flight time, maximum velocity, etc. When the rocket lands, this data will be transmitted back to the app and displayed graphically to visualize and share, at the launch site and online. Now that would be AWESOME! Imagine comparing engine performance across flights or competing with your brother-in-law to see who can hit the stratosphere!<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> We know we can do this, it just takes more time and money.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span></p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mobilemissioncontrol.com/indiegogo/BlueNose9.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">How did we make it?</span></strong></p>
<p>Bluetooth low energy system-on-chip, custom circuit board, wires, duct tape and bubblegum. :)  Seriously, we have worked through several challenges to achieve a working prototype. Specifically being able to have a controlled and sufficient amount of power delivered to trigger the igniter in the engine and working on implementing 4-wire sensing to detect if there are any problems with the igniter.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt=""LCD Display"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mobilemissioncontrol.com/indiegogo/BlueNose-LCD.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Getting a custom circuit board ready for this (not the ugly prototype one in the video) is where a lot of the time and money will be used. This is not something we are able to do in our garages and why crowdfunding makes sense.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy;""> </span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">Enclosure</span></strong></p>
<p>ExternalMeasurements of the MMC are:  8<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>"" x 4"" x 1<sup>7</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>""</p>
<p>We thought using this 0.55 litre clear plastic case would be cool for this crowdfunding project. People will be amazed when they see you launching your model rocket with your smartphone and you can see all the electronics and wires in the case. It also helps provide some element of water resistance when launching out in the field.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">Why do we need you?</span></strong></p>
<p>We need you to help promote our project (website, twitter, facebook, email to friends) and help us reach our goals. Model rocketry should be wireless for the launch and we would love to reach our stretch goals so flight metrics can be collected wirelessly and shared online!!</p>
<p>Purchasing the components required for this project alone in single units is much more expensive than being able to buy them in bulk. Getting our custom circuit board printed requires quantity.  Reaching our stretch goals will permit us to also support Android smartphones.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">Safety</span></strong></p>
<p>Model rockets do involve igniting a rocket motor/engine. We recommend an adult is always involved, the launch area is roped off and adults only enters the secured area to connect the igniter ensuring beforehand that the master switch is off on the launcher control box and cable to igniter is disconnected.</p>
<p>Only use prepackaged rocket engines. Check the engines before to ensure your defects or cracks. Inspect the rocket. Do not use any metal parts.</p>
<p>Always do a countdown before the launch (which is part of the fun), that way everyone is aware of an imminent launch.</p>
<p>Do not fly in high winds or threatening weather. Do not fly in unsafe locations.</p>
<p>This is a very fun and exciting hobby however always keep safety as your first priority. Fun can be a close second. :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">Risks and challenges</span></strong></p>
<p>Bluetooth low energy has a small range and uses 2.4 GHz frequencies. It is possible to have interference, possible that multiple smartphones in the same area with the app can cause problems. Having weak batteries can cause issues with igniters and electronics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">Disclaimer</span></strong></p>
<p>You are building and launching rockets at your own risk. You will be responsible to check if everything is safe. Rocketry and related activities is not without risk. You agree not to hold liable any owners, affiliates, employers, Indiegogo, or us. SAFETY ALWAYS COMES FIRST.</p>
<p>Always observe any local safety codes such as by NAR or TRA. Make sure you comply with local, municipal, state/provincial, and/or federal laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Safety isn’t just with the launching of the rockets, it is also when assembling or preparing anything. Wear appropriate protection such as gloves, eye protection, and such as needed.</p>
<p>You are responsible for ensuring the location and weather conditions are safe, and that everything being used to launch the rocket is safe and stable.</p>
<p>Do not back this project unless you understand and agree with this disclaimer and are of sufficient age to do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: navy; font-size: 2em;"">FAQ</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is the app compatible with iPhones, iPod Touch, and iPads?</strong></p>
<p><em>   The iPhone must be running iOS 6 or later. We can support iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad that have BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). <br/>   iPhone4S, iPhone5, iPhone Touch (5th Generation), or iPad (3rd Generation, ""new"" iPad, retina, and mini) or newer.<br/></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Does it work with Androids?</strong></p>
<p><em>   YES! Both iOS and Android will be supported for anyone obtaining an MMC kit. Your smartphone must support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate with the MMC.<br/></em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong>Can I collect flight data?</strong></p>
<p><em>   Only if stretch goal 2 is achieved.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I share flight data information?</strong></p>
<p><em>   Only if stretch goal 3 is achieved.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is there a safety/security concern regarding accidental ignitions?</strong></p>
<p><em>   As far as malicious/accidental launches from interference or other phones, we will protect against that. BLE has encrypted PKI authentication. We'll use that if it works; otherwise we'll roll our own based on a shared secret during initial setup. The app will let you set an identifier for your phone.  We will throw a tiny pushbutton into the circuit on one of the BLE module pins to let the endusers put the thing back into ""setup mode"" if we end up needing that. If not, it can either be a no-op or simply not populated on the board, depending on when we make the decision. This depends on level of funding available and number of units we need to assemble.<br/></em></p>
<p><em>   The key safety mechanism overall is that you don't plug the firing cable in till you're ready to launch. There were will be a master switch as well on the case in addition to LEDs indicating status of the system. Ultimately there is always a chance that the hardware or firmware will fail. The only completely reliable safety is the lack of connectivity (physical cable going to the igniter being disconnected). <br/></em></p>
<p><em>   Keep in mind that the current leading model rocket launchers do not have this as a safety feature (the removable launch cable). While the key-in-launcher system is perfectly safe in practice, with our version you can plainly SEE that the thing is disconnected and can't fire. That beats hoping the kid holding the launcher isn't jaming something into the keyhole. We feel our system can be more secure if used properly.<br/></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is it possible for me to write my own software interface to it (either do my own app or via Ardruino/rPi)?</strong></p>
<p><em>   As for ""hacker"" accessibility, we are fine with publishing schematics and the BLE protocol we use. In addition, we figure we'd keep the female headers - the ones we had in the prototype - in the production version, as well as keeping the BLE (male) programming header in place. These allow testing/troubleshooting for us, as well as last minute reprogramming. Hackers can use these to reprogram the BLE module itself or monitor/control it.<br/></em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do I need to add shipping to my pledge?</strong></p>
<p>     <em>If you live in the US or Canada, shipping is included. For all other countries, please add $30 to your pledge. Local import taxes may apply, we are not responsible for any additional charges.</em></p>

<p><strong>What is the range possible between my smartphone and the MMC? </strong></p>
<p> <em>We are using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which has a nominal range of 160 ft (50 m). This project is aimed squarely at the ""sunday afternoon with kids"" ""Estes rockets"" market. Hope this helps put things into perspective. Our target audience is NOT the HPR crowd.</em>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to have interference issues? </strong></p>
<p> <em>In terms of radio noise triggering the device, that is impossible. The mobile device communicates with our MMC launch box using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. The BLE module in the launcher contains an embedded microcontroller that controls and monitors the launch circuitry. The only way that the launcher will fire the igniter is if it receives a properly formatted, authenticated bluetooth protocol message. This is definitely NOT a ""see this radio frequency, turn on a switch"" type device. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy</a> for more background information. By way of analogy, there are no circumstances under which rubbing a 9V battery on your HDMI cable would put your picture on the TV or interference on your WiFi causing you to accidentally receive a copy of Microsoft Office. This is the same thing.</em></p>
<p>In terms of accidental or malicious launching by third parties, the mobile device and launcher are associated using BLE pairing and bonding. Launch (and other) messages are encrypted and authenticated. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetoo...ng_and_bonding"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetoo...ng_and_bonding</a> for more background information. No one else can fire your rocket.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are some other safety mechanisms? </strong></p>
<p> <em> The cable running from the launch box to the igniter is removable at the launch box end. We are using a simple and easy to remove connector. The safety protocol is that you only plug the cable into the launcher after you have attached the clips and walked away.</em></p>
<p>The launcher detects and reports the following conditions, which are indicated on the launch box with LED's, and also on the app immediately (which is great for instant troubleshooting): 1) launch cable disconnected, 2) launch cable connected but igniter connection open (broken), and 3) igniter short circuited (wires touching somewhere). For those who want the technical details, this is accomplished with Four-terminal sensing. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-terminal_sensing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-terminal_sensing</a> for background information.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are the hook clips good enough for my igniters? </strong></p>
<p> <em> The current requirement to reliably fire an Estes igniter with no perceptible delay is approx 1.5 Amperes. The igniter fire time is less than one second. The hook clips used in the project are rated for 5.9 Amps (continuous duty).</em>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will my MMC kit have a homemade looking circuit like in the video and photos? </strong></p>
<p> <em> No. As posted in the project description above, the product will ship with a printed circuit board, not a perfboard. This is one of the reasons for the crowd funding.</em>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are these model rockets re-usable? </strong></p>
<p> <em> The model rockets we supply are reusable. You can send them up for multiple launches. You just need extra engines and igniters.</em>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I am thinking to back one, but not sure which level should be backed. I am looking for complete solution. </strong></p>
<p> <em> The $149 everything you need kit has everything you need. :) As some have already discovered, you could save $10 by going with the “beginning model rocket kit” at $60 and the “early bird assembled mmc kic” at $79. This totals only $139 for both because you are benefitting from obtaining an early bird kit (same mmc kit, lower price).</em>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are “A” Engines and Igniters? </strong></p>
<p> <em> An “A” sized engine represents the physical size of the engine and the amount of power it has to launch. A/B/C engines are all the same size. B engines are twice as powerful as an A and C engines are twice as powerful as a B (so four times more than an A). This is needed sometimes for heavier/larger rockets, or if you want to launch a lot higher.</em></p>
<p>The A engine kits provided as perks are ideal for beginners. You could launch in a football field sized area. The higher you go with stronger engines, the more space you need to have due to wind potentially carrying your model rocket back (it has a parachute that ejects near the height of the launch).</p>
<p>Our beginner kit includes 3 engines and igniters so you can launch 3 times. It is very inexpensive to buy more engines if you really like it to launch your rocket some more. You can decide if you want to go with B or C sized engines which will also fit in the model rocket we supply. You can also use the MMC and launch pad to launch other model rockets. You will have what you need, so this gets you started in a great hobby.  </p>

Will my product look like the video and photos?
No. This is a working prototype to show what we have accomplished. The crowdfunding will go towards a custom printed circuit board, better connectors and components, and overall superior design. The case depicted is the identical one and we list the exterior dimensions below in the details. Please keep in mind that this project is aimed at basic model rocketry out on a Sunday with kids using A-E engines. It is not for the HPR community. 
 

Why BlueNose Mobile Mission Control (MMC)?
Model rocketry is a lot of fun, but let's face it - the launch process is a little antiquated. Who amongst us hasn't cursed those shiny little alligator clips that barely hang on, except when they're trying desparately to touch each other? And every amateur rocketeer knows the frustration of performing a countdown, pressing down the safety key, holding your breath, and jamming the launch button only to have nothing happen.

Imagine this instead. You open the missile cover on your Mobile Mission Control (MMC) and flip the toggle switch. The app on your phone immediately recognizes the launch module and activates the control interface. You connect to the igniter using the supplied professional hook clips. They grab on, don't let go, and are fully insulated to prevent short circuits. You plug the cable into the MMC and your smartphone shows you the wiring status. Almost always, that status is Good to Go. But if the igniter was split or squashed when that little plug went in, you know immediately. Status lights on the launcher and an alert in the app tell you whether a short circuit or open circuit would have delayed your launch.

Then you perform your countdown and touch the button. Inside that little box, a sophisticated four-wire sensing circuit is activated to deliver a precision controlled launch current, and with a sharp whoosh, your rocket disappears into the sky. The launch times you see in the video are the real thing. You press the button and it launches immediately.
 
 

Why back us?
Model rockets are great for people of all ages. They are fun to build and even more fun to launch! We are passionate about model rocketry and technology, and we want to bring them together to help take the hobby to the next level.
Improving your launches is just the beginning. With your support, we can reach our stretch goals and achieve integrated telemetry. An embedded altimeter and accelerometer will let you log and wirelessly transmit flight metrics such as acceleration, flight time, height, speed and so on. One more wireless hop and your adventures are shared with friends and competitors online. Have a look at our stretch goals below, especially #2 and #3.
 

This IS rocket science!
Lighting some powder on fire in a cardboard tube to launch a rocket is a pretty simple idea. Doing it efficiently and reliably, however, does require a bit of finesse.
Did you know that the launchers from that big rocket company work by short circuiting your expensive batteries across the igniter?
The MMC fires the igniter under precision microcontroller supervision. Which means you get a strong current for a rapid positive ignition without treating your batteries harshly (so they last longer) and also ensuring that the igniter will glow a nice bright orange for the duration of the ignition, but won't be overdriven and burn out prematurely. 
We increasingly live in an untethered world. And let's face it - remote control is fun! We feel that Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is the perfect choice. Not only because the range and security work so well for wireless launching. The exremely low power requirements and minimal payload impact make BLE suitable for communicating that crucial launch data that you want to see and share. 
While it's not in scope for right now, the design of the launcher takes into consideration the requirements of multi-engine rockets, and simulataneous launches of multiple rockets.
 

App
With the base project funding goal, we will be releasing an iPhone app. We have this working in our proof of concept trials communicating over Bluetooth Low Energy. The app will be used to wirelessly trigger the launcher to ignite the model rocket motor engine by sending a burst of power to the igniter. The iPhone must be running iOS 6 or later. We can support any iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad that has BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). In the case of iPhones, that means iPhone 4S or better.
Should we reach a higher funding level (stretch goal #1) per the details below, we will be able to develop an Android app as well. We have Android app development experience and know we can do this.
But the real adventure starts with stretch goals #2 and #3. A tiny sensor module, attached to the nose cone of the rocket, will capture real time flight data: acceleration, altitude, flight time, maximum velocity, etc. When the rocket lands, this data will be transmitted back to the app and displayed graphically to visualize and share, at the launch site and online. Now that would be AWESOME! Imagine comparing engine performance across flights or competing with your brother-in-law to see who can hit the stratosphere! We know we can do this, it just takes more time and money.
 

How did we make it?
Bluetooth low energy system-on-chip, custom circuit board, wires, duct tape and bubblegum. :)  Seriously, we have worked through several challenges to achieve a working prototype. Specifically being able to have a controlled and sufficient amount of power delivered to trigger the igniter in the engine and working on implementing 4-wire sensing to detect if there are any problems with the igniter.

Getting a custom circuit board ready for this (not the ugly prototype one in the video) is where a lot of the time and money will be used. This is not something we are able to do in our garages and why crowdfunding makes sense.
 

Enclosure
ExternalMeasurements of the MMC are:  81⁄2"" x 4"" x 17⁄16""
We thought using this 0.55 litre clear plastic case would be cool for this crowdfunding project. People will be amazed when they see you launching your model rocket with your smartphone and you can see all the electronics and wires in the case. It also helps provide some element of water resistance when launching out in the field.
 

Why do we need you?
We need you to help promote our project (website, twitter, facebook, email to friends) and help us reach our goals. Model rocketry should be wireless for the launch and we would love to reach our stretch goals so flight metrics can be collected wirelessly and shared online!!
Purchasing the components required for this project alone in single units is much more expensive than being able to buy them in bulk. Getting our custom circuit board printed requires quantity.  Reaching our stretch goals will permit us to also support Android smartphones.
 
Production plan
Assembled kits starting to ship after 30 days of project funding.
Optional Android app within 60 days (based on stretch goal 1 funding achieved).
Optional Wireless Altimeter and Accelerometer within 180 days (based on stretch goal 2 funding achieved).
Optional Share Your Flight Metrics Online within 210 days (based on stretch goal 3 funding achieved).
 

Help get us to higher levels for more features!

STRETCH GOAL #1
NOW INCLUDED! - We are adding Android support. Everyone who purchases an MMC kit will have the option to download this version for their Smartphone at no additional charge. No additional perks will be added if we achieve this goal, all people obtaining an MMC will be notified of how to download the Android version of the App.
 

STRETCH GOAL #2
If we can reach $50,000 in funding, we will be able to create a Bluetooth altimeter and accelerometer that will attach to a nose cone. This module will collect flight metrics such as maximum height achieved, fastest speed achieved, and total flight time. When you recover your launched rocket, the module will send the information to your app wirelessly. We have already been conducting tests for this and feel confident it can be done. New perks will appear if we achieve this stretch goal.
 

STRETCH GOAL #3
If we can reach $70,000 in funding, we will be able to have the app share your flight metrics online with your friends. This would be AWESOME. Brag about how high or fast your model rocket was. Have a history of flights. Compare with others identical model kits with different engines used and what effect it has. New perks will appear if we achieve this stretch goal.

Safety
Model rockets do involve igniting a rocket motor/engine. We recommend an adult is always involved, the launch area is roped off and adults only enters the secured area to connect the igniter ensuring beforehand that the master switch is off on the launcher control box and cable to igniter is disconnected.
Only use prepackaged rocket engines. Check the engines before to ensure your defects or cracks. Inspect the rocket. Do not use any metal parts.
Always do a countdown before the launch (which is part of the fun), that way everyone is aware of an imminent launch.
Do not fly in high winds or threatening weather. Do not fly in unsafe locations.
This is a very fun and exciting hobby however always keep safety as your first priority. Fun can be a close second. :)
 
Risks and challenges
Bluetooth low energy has a small range and uses 2.4 GHz frequencies. It is possible to have interference, possible that multiple smartphones in the same area with the app can cause problems. Having weak batteries can cause issues with igniters and electronics.

FAQ
 
Is the app compatible with iPhones, iPod Touch, and iPads?
   The iPhone must be running iOS 6 or later. We can support iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad that have BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).    iPhone4S, iPhone5, iPhone Touch (5th Generation), or iPad (3rd Generation, ""new"" iPad, retina, and mini) or newer.
 
Does it work with Androids?
   YES! Both iOS and Android will be supported for anyone obtaining an MMC kit. Your smartphone must support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate with the MMC.

Can I collect flight data?
   Only if stretch goal 2 is achieved.
 
Can I share flight data information?
   Only if stretch goal 3 is achieved.
 
Is there a safety/security concern regarding accidental ignitions?
   As far as malicious/accidental launches from interference or other phones, we will protect against that. BLE has encrypted PKI authentication. We'll use that if it works; otherwise we'll roll our own based on a shared secret during initial setup. The app will let you set an identifier for your phone.  We will throw a tiny pushbutton into the circuit on one of the BLE module pins to let the endusers put the thing back into ""setup mode"" if we end up needing that. If not, it can either be a no-op or simply not populated on the board, depending on when we make the decision. This depends on level of funding available and number of units we need to assemble.
   The key safety mechanism overall is that you don't plug the firing cable in till you're ready to launch. There were will be a master switch as well on the case in addition to LEDs indicating status of the system. Ultimately there is always a chance that the hardware or firmware will fail. The only completely reliable safety is the lack of connectivity (physical cable going to the igniter being disconnected). 
   Keep in mind that the current leading model rocket launchers do not have this as a safety feature (the removable launch cable). While the key-in-launcher system is perfectly safe in practice, with our version you can plainly SEE that the thing is disconnected and can't fire. That beats hoping the kid holding the launcher isn't jaming something into the keyhole. We feel our system can be more secure if used properly.
 
Is it possible for me to write my own software interface to it (either do my own app or via Ardruino/rPi)?
   As for ""hacker"" accessibility, we are fine with publishing schematics and the BLE protocol we use. In addition, we figure we'd keep the female headers - the ones we had in the prototype - in the production version, as well as keeping the BLE (male) programming header in place. These allow testing/troubleshooting for us, as well as last minute reprogramming. Hackers can use these to reprogram the BLE module itself or monitor/control it.
 
Do I need to add shipping to my pledge?
     If you live in the US or Canada, shipping is included. For all other countries, please add $30 to your pledge. Local import taxes may apply, we are not responsible for any additional charges.
 
I contributed to a perk but forgot to add $30 for shipping. How can I fix this?
  If you need to add funds for shipping, you can make another contribution and select ""No Perk, Just a Contribution."" or you can select the ""FORGOT INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING"" perk. 
 
I cannot get my PayPal payment to work, what should I do?
  Email the Indiegogo Customer Team at support@indiegogo.com - they should be able to track your transaction and help with any issues you have. Provide them with as many details as possible (date/time, amount, etc).
 
What if we fail to reach our funding target?
 We appreciate all the support we get and will still send out any perks that were contributed.  
 
Do any warranties apply?
    Unfortunately there are no warranties provided with any of these perks. However we are nice guys and will definitely help out. Contact us with whatever problems you have encountered.

<h2>Our Work</h2>
<p>As the DOOZY WATCH is slowly coming together we have put in a large amount of effort and time into it.  Starting with our design, we have worked closely with watch expertise to finalize what we have visioned. With the new Bluetooth® technology we have custom a tiny Bluetooth® PCBA for the watch.  Working countless hours designing the APPS software for the iOS 7 was a challenge but have nailed down the functionality to sync with the DOOZY WATCH.  In regards about the ANDROID 4.3 system, it is a little more complicated of a system but we are near completing this platform.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>DOOZY Watch Team </b></p>
<p>The original concept came upon with two family members who is into new innovation products.  As we learned that two people can not accomplish a feat like this, we have 2 additional skilled designers to come up with the DOOZY Watch.  From designing, testing, and development we have came to the stage we are at right now.  </p>
<p><b>The IDEA </b></p>
<p>While I was sitting at the local coffee shop I have done some research on Smart Watches.  I was wondering how can I differ from the existing smart watches out there. I was looking for a simple, functional watch with a lower price point than the existing Digital Smart Watches. There are a lot of smart square faced digital watches which was not appealing to my personal lifestyle.  I am an Analog type of person when it comes to watches.  I wanted simple functionality with Bluetooth® that performs basic alerts.  After all, I always have my phone nearby if I really need to use it.  That is when I came up with an alert watch with Bluetooth® functionality. Even with the idea I had, our team had implemented more features and made it user friendly.  Reality kicked in when we saw the first working prototype. </p>
<h3>Where are we at now? </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Prototypes are finished. We are currently testing the DOOZY App with the iOS 7 platform anticipating the release from Apple very shortly. Once that is completed, we will be working on the Android v4.3.  <br/></p>

<h3>Help get the DOOZY Watch from the prototype stage to production</h3>
<div>
<p>With our talented team, we have made the prototype, finalized the style, and developed applications. With this well built time piece with Bluetooth® Smart features we need Indiegogo and especially <b>YOU</b> to bring this product live into the market late December. Getting to the next step is the biggest obstacle.  We need funds to for initial set up, quality control, and get the DOOZY WATCH to a full capacity working stage. Please pledge to get the DOOZY WATCH into production. </p>
<p>We need funds for development. production, licensing, and materials. We also want to expand this watch to be Android capable which will widen the market. </p>
<p>There are many ways to fund this project such as getting investors, business loans, however we have decided to use Indiegogo  because we believe this community has a one of kind lifestyle and people like you can help us to our goal. </p>
<p>With Indiegogo we can interact with updates and comments and we can assure you everything will be addressed in a timely manner. We hope to ""connect"" with you not with just the DOOZY Watch but to be part of the Doozy life! </p>

Synced with your iPhone or Android* platform via Bluetooth® Smart Technology, you will receive important alerts all on your watch. 
WHAT is the DOOZY Watch? 
The DOOZY WATCH is a trendy, fashionable well designed analog watch with Bluetooth® Smart Technology.  This specially designed watch syncs with your cell phone displaying L.E.D. notification, Vibration and Series of beeps, immediately when you receive an alert.  Keeping the simplicity of the 3 hands movement design, we have implemented today's technology into a well built, eye catching watch.
WHY the DOOZY Watch? 
There are many ""Smart"" watches in today's market that looks good, but functionality is not up to standard. What makes the DOOZY WATCH stand out from the rest?  Most smart watches in the market are ""match box"" like which consumes a lot of power causing constant charging. Many of their designs are dot matrix, cubic shaped, which makes it difficult to read the display. We have believe in our concept of FUNCTIONALITY, SIMPLICITY, and STYLE of a basic analog watch with comparable smart watch capabilities. With a style that you can wear both formally or casually, you will never leave your DOOZY WATCH at home.


The Doozy Watch Concept: ""SIMPLICITY""
With our style and capabilities of the DOOZY WATCH we know that this product is one of a kind geared up to the newest and latest software in the market. How our concept differs: 



What FEATURES are there? 


The DOOZY WATCH focus is very simple: NOTIFICATION ALERTS 


and Many More...!
Most of the time your cell phone is with you.  So why have a DIGITAL Display Bluetooth® Watch with a hard to see screen?


I Misplaced My Phone! 


Don't worry!  The DOOZY WATCH can locate that for you. You can simply hit the ""Find Phone"" feature on your watch and it will communicate with your phone which will sound an alert on your phone so you can find it. 
""Forgot Phone Alert,"" not only if you left the phone in your house but also if it gets stolen or you simply forget it somewhere, your watch will sound and alert. This automatic alert function on the watch would appeal to forgetful people, party goers, and people who just have the tendency to misplace or forget their phones.

""Forgot Phone"" Alert 
Low Battery Alert
The DOOZY WATCH will actually alert you and let you know that your battery is running low on your phone.
""SNAP"" Self Portraits 
Don't need to ask help from strangers ever again. No one will be left out of the picture, and best of all, you can take self photos together with your favoriite background. You can now be in priceless photos with just a click on the DOOZY WATCH. You can also remotely take pictures on your smart phone without any assistance.
Our Unique Designs
With many variations of designs for the DOOZY WATCH, we have come to a conclusion to our current design.  We wanted our design to be simple but yet modern with a unique Bluetooth® feature.  Below are the styles and colors that can be readily produced with our funds. We are hoping to have various colors in the future.

The original concept came upon with two family members who is into new innovation products.  As we learned that two people can not accomplish a feat like this, we have 2 additional skilled designers to come up with the DOOZY Watch.  From designing, testing, and development we have came to the stage we are at right now.  
The IDEA 
While I was sitting at the local coffee shop I have done some research on Smart Watches.  I was wondering how can I differ from the existing smart watches out there. I was looking for a simple, functional watch with a lower price point than the existing Digital Smart Watches. There are a lot of smart square faced digital watches which was not appealing to my personal lifestyle.  I am an Analog type of person when it comes to watches.  I wanted simple functionality with Bluetooth® that performs basic alerts.  After all, I always have my phone nearby if I really need to use it.  That is when I came up with an alert watch with Bluetooth® functionality. Even with the idea I had, our team had implemented more features and made it user friendly.  Reality kicked in when we saw the first working prototype. 
Where are we at now? 

Prototypes are finished. We are currently testing the DOOZY App with the iOS 7 platform anticipating the release from Apple very shortly. Once that is completed, we will be working on the Android v4.3.  


TIMELINE

Help get the DOOZY Watch from the prototype stage to production

With our talented team, we have made the prototype, finalized the style, and developed applications. With this well built time piece with Bluetooth® Smart features we need Indiegogo and especially YOU to bring this product live into the market late December. Getting to the next step is the biggest obstacle.  We need funds to for initial set up, quality control, and get the DOOZY WATCH to a full capacity working stage. Please pledge to get the DOOZY WATCH into production. 
We need funds for development. production, licensing, and materials. We also want to expand this watch to be Android capable which will widen the market. 
There are many ways to fund this project such as getting investors, business loans, however we have decided to use Indiegogo  because we believe this community has a one of kind lifestyle and people like you can help us to our goal. 
With Indiegogo we can interact with updates and comments and we can assure you everything will be addressed in a timely manner. We hope to ""connect"" with you not with just the DOOZY Watch but to be part of the Doozy life!

The <strong>Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act (SSCRA)</strong> provides an umbrella of legal protection for our deployed service members while serving in combat.<br/>Such as the following: Reduced interest rate on mortgage payments ; Reduced interest on credit card debt ; Protection from eviction if your rent is $1,200 or less ; ""<strong>Delay of all civil court actions</strong>, such as bankruptcy, foreclosure <strong>and/or divorce proceedings</strong>"".</p><p><em><strong>""There is no such protections for deployed civilian personnel that provide vital services in support of our troops while in the same combat environment"".</strong></em></p><p><br/>My name is Donald Schell and I'm a father fighting for my basic parental rights! If I had similar protection offered in the SSCRA, I would be home right now with my daughter. Here is my story...</p><p> </p><p>In late 2009 I was deployed to Afghanistan as a Civilian Firefighter both as a patriot and to provide a better life for my family. In May 2010 my ex-wife had an issue leading to her losing custody of our daughter to her parents, and because she was proven an unfit parent by her parents.</p><p>We (My ex-wife's parents and I) made an arrangement over the phone allowing my daughter to reside with them until I completed my contract and acquired a home. They agreed to watch her until my return, as I would gain full custody. They assured me that they would uphold their end of the bargain and my normal visitation rights wouldn't be interrupted.</p><p>In August I called to speak to my daughter and let them know I was returning for my holiday visit in December.  I was informed by my ex-wife's parents that I need to speak to their lawyer and my phone calls with my daughter were terminated until I acquired counsel.</p><p>I retained a lawyer only to discover that some how my Marriage Settlement Agreement (MSA) in Florida had been dissolved, my visitation rights terminated, and her schools had been directed not to release any details of my daughters' progress to me. I also discovered that my ex-wife's parents were filing for custody.</p><p>When I arrived back in the USA from Afghanistan in December 2010 to see my daughter it had been roughly 6-7 months since my last visit with her (Our longest separation from each other at that time). I spent nearly a week in court and nearly $19,000 in fees / expenses just to get 10.5 days visitation with my daughter. My ex-wife's parents filed false claims... such as my daughter not knowing me and/or afraid of my family and I... All which were proved to be false accusations. To prove these allegations false I has to pay my daughters attorney fees ($250/hr) for a 2-3hr assessment, just to see if my daughter would recognize me and/or was afraid of me as claimed. The results of the assessment allowed a 24hr visit with my daughter over the weekend and then in court the following Monday I was granted a 10.5 day visit with her that December.</p><p>Up until that point I've not had any interruptions or hard times visiting my daughter, other that my ex-wife moving around the country numerous times and not finding out till the last minute. I spend as much quality time with her as possible and every chance I can.</p><p>I spent the last 3-4 years battling my ex-wife's parents. My legal fees and traveling expenses from Michigan &amp; Afghanistan to Texas have exceeded over $70,000 to gain visitations and battle for my rights as a father. In January we had a ""Trail by Jury"" and the case was ""Mis-Trialed"" and reset for August 2014.</p><p>I still owe roughly $14,000 to my lawyer from the trial in January, along with his $20,000 retainer for the upcoming trail in August. I also owe my daughters' court appointed lawyer about $5,000 in fees, as ordered by the judge from trial; this doesn't include the fees needed for the upcoming trial in August.<br/>Furthermore this does not include the fees / expenses to fly my daughters lawyer to Michigan this summer to evaluate my home, meet the rest of my family (Estimate$5,000-$10,000 in legal fees/expenses). This doesn't include the fees / expenses so I can have a summer visit with my daughter upon my return from Afghanistan this summer.</p><p>I fly back to the USA from Afghanistan to see my daughter every chance I get; I've met nothing but resistance, resulting in thousands of dollars in fees just for visitations with my daughter. When I should've been able to come home on leave an enjoy good quality daddy/daughter time. </p><p>If similar protection in the SSCRA had been provide to both deployed troops and my fellow civilians supporting the war fighters. My rights as  a father wouldn't have been hindered, I would've been able to return home long ago and have full custody as I should.</p><p>The only thing I'm guilty of is going to Afghanistan to work. I have no criminal record outside of a few traffic violations over the years... I'm a Veteran of the United States Air Force and a Firefighter currently in Afghanistan till mid-summer 2014.</p><p>I've been wrongfully accused of abandoning my daughter, even though I have made every effort on my own to spend as much time with her as possible and bring her back home to Michigan with my family.</p><p>One of the questions I'm most commonly asked is ""Why haven't /don't you come home, get a job and then get your daughter?""</p><p>Answer is simple... Had I been working a normal 9-5 job; with the extreme costs this case has racked up; there is no way I would've been able to afford the legal fees and travel expenses. My job afforded me an opportunity to establish and furnish a home to provide a safe and loving environment for my daughter to grow and prosper...</p><p>So yes, I chose to do what it takes to provide and fight for my daughter! The money I made in the time here, has allowed me to continue the fight, acquire a home for my family and allowed me up to 45 days to fight for and visit my daughter. With the ""Harsh economic conditions"" we have now in Michigan, there is no way I would've been able to afford it, if I had stayed home.</p><p> <br/><strong>My Goals:</strong></p><p>Why I set my goal for $200,000 you may ask...?</p><p>So far this case has cost me about $70,000 in fees / expenses, to include two personal loans (Totaling $45,000) to aid in the legal fees / expenses involving the case.<br/>I still owe a remaining $19,000 from the ""Mis-Trial"" back in January to my daughters lawyer (Approx. $5,000) &amp; my attorney (Approx. $14,000 due by June 1st 2014)<br/>My daughters' lawyer fees will be about $10,000 for the trial<br/>My daughters' lawyer trip to Michigan will cost up to about $10,000 for her several day stay to evaluate my family, my home, neighborhood and schools...<br/>My trip to Texas for the trial in August will cost about $4,000 for airline, hotel, car rental and gas...</p><p>This case will roughly cost me a total of $133,000 altogether. $63,000 in fees / expenses that I need to come up with before August; $34,000 due by June 1st 2014.</p><p>The site has a 4% fee (Up to $8,000) if the goal is successfully reached or 9% fee (Up to $18,000) if your goal isn't reached. (I need $141,000 up to $151,000 depending on if the goal is reached or not).</p><p>This doesn't include the cost to fight for a prolonged summer visit with my daughter before the trial. Pat history proves this will run several thousand more... Lets say best case $4,000 in legal fees (My lawyers rate is $350/hr &amp; his Legal Assistant $100/hr &amp; my daughters lawyer $250/hr) and lets not forget the court filing fees after the lawyers are done going back in forth (Total needed now is $145,000 up to $155,000)</p><p>The remaining $45,000-$55,000 will go towards the <strong>""TAXES""</strong> that Uncle Sam will hit me on the funds raised, any other unexpected costs that may result from the case, my daughters' future education and retaining counsel to push my case to a higher court as an example of why deployed civilians need similar legal protection like in the SSCRA! All this money wasted could've gone to a better purpose involving my daughters future, but I had to redirect my time, money and resources towards the case instead of investing in her future.<br/><br/><strong>Your Impact:</strong></p><p>As I stated before, each time I requested to see my daughter since this case began... I've met nothing but resistance by days/weeks of time wasted by unnecessary court hearings and false claims resulting in more fees exceeding several thousands of dollars that could've gone towards my daughter' future. This robbed my 12 year old and I of precious quality daddy/daughter time together and has been a huge burden on my family that has created a financial hardship and most of all stressed my relationship with my daughter. <br/><br/>By presenting my case to a higher court and approaching congress if needed to modify the SSCRA and/or creating a separate piece of legislation to help protect deployed civilians; would save valuable resources, money &amp; time not only in our judicial system, but reduce those stresses for the impacted family members. Instead of having long drawn out proceedings.<br/></p><p> <strong>If I don't reach my goal:</strong></p><p>If I don't reach my set goal, the money I do raise will still go towards gaining my rights as a father. I plan to use my case to push for legislation similar to the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act but for the Civilians working in Combat Zones.

<h3>SwitchLok is NOT your average phone mount!</h3>

It's patent pending interface auto-aligns--just get your phone close and its magnetic personality takes over, locking your phone in place. <strong>One hand is all you need to put it on or take it off and it's signature 'snap' lets you know that your phone is safe.</strong></p>

<p>Hi, I'm Marc and I am the creator of SwitchLok. I'm a father of two little kids, a mediocre (but aspiring) triathlete and a bike commuter, I was frequently driving, running and riding without a great spot for my phone to come along. Why was everything so clunky, uncomfortable or bulky? Why couldn’t there be a simple, convenient and seamless way to have your phone with you?</p>
<p>After years of frustration, I decided to do something about it: leveraging 14 years of aerospace engineering experience, I created SwitchLok. Initially, it was just an evening project: I'd sketch some ideas, put together a model in CAD, get a 3D print and take it out for a test run or ride. The process was fun and the product was getting better all the time. Soon, people at work started asking about it and if they could buy one. Eventually, I quit my job and went all in. I poured over every detail of how the case should feel in your hand, what the perfect armband would be and most importantly, getting the SwitchLok interface just right.</p>
<p>Now I've brought SwitchLok to Indiegogo and I am so grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this incredible community. All of your support is deeply appreciated and I know that once you try SwitchLok, you will absolutely love it.</p>

<p>The <strong>SwitchLok Case</strong> is the centerpiece of our system and we designed it with comfort, performance and style in mind. Textured sides, a thin profile, responsive buttons and spacious port cutouts mean its a pleasure to handle. With a rigid plate shielding the back of the phone, shock absorbing TPU (rubber-like material) around the sides, and a generous lip above the screen, your phone is well protected.  We also include an optional tether for extra security.  <u>Our case is built for the iPhone X and XS. If you have another phone, we've got you covered! Check out the adapter below.</u></p>

<p>Do you run holding your phone? Maybe you shove it into one of those plastic pockets? The <strong>SwitchLok Run </strong>mount was made for you!

It's also the most comfortable armband you will ever find.  The <strong>SwitchLok Run</strong> mount has a smooth, curved profile to comfortably rest on your arm. The elastic is soft and smooth, totally different from the stiff, scratchy bands you're used to. We lined the interior of the band with grippy material to keep it comfortably in place.</p>

Tired of your phone slipping and sliding around your car? When you're at the gym, is your phone in a pocket or on the ground, just waiting to get crushed? SwitchLok™ is a system of phone case and mounts that's effortless to use and completely secure. It's patent pending interface auto-aligns--just get your phone close and its magnetic personality takes over, locking your phone in place. One hand is all you need to put it on or take it off and it's signature 'snap' lets you know that your phone is safe.

""I was skeptical of another quick-release case mount style system designed for athletes. But this one actually impressed me.""
-DC Rainmaker
“It’s as easy has blindly aiming your phone towards to mount and as long as you are close, it will engage.” 
-Brett (Beta Tester) 
From The Creator

Hi, I'm Marc and I am the creator of SwitchLok. I'm a father of two little kids, a mediocre (but aspiring) triathlete and a bike commuter, I was frequently driving, running and riding without a great spot for my phone to come along. Why was everything so clunky, uncomfortable or bulky? Why couldn’t there be a simple, convenient and seamless way to have your phone with you?
After years of frustration, I decided to do something about it: leveraging 14 years of aerospace engineering experience, I created SwitchLok. Initially, it was just an evening project: I'd sketch some ideas, put together a model in CAD, get a 3D print and take it out for a test run or ride. The process was fun and the product was getting better all the time. Soon, people at work started asking about it and if they could buy one. Eventually, I quit my job and went all in. I poured over every detail of how the case should feel in your hand, what the perfect armband would be and most importantly, getting the SwitchLok interface just right.
Now I've brought SwitchLok to Indiegogo and I am so grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this incredible community. All of your support is deeply appreciated and I know that once you try SwitchLok, you will absolutely love it.


SwitchLok Mounts in Detail

The SwitchLok Case is the centerpiece of our system and we designed it with comfort, performance and style in mind. Textured sides, a thin profile, responsive buttons and spacious port cutouts mean its a pleasure to handle. With a rigid plate shielding the back of the phone, shock absorbing TPU (rubber-like material) around the sides, and a generous lip above the screen, your phone is well protected.  We also include an optional tether for extra security.  Our case is built for the iPhone X and XS. If you have another phone, we've got you covered! Check out the adapter below.





At just 0.1 inches thin, the SwitchLok Adapter allows you to use nearly any modern phone with the SwitchLok system. It provides the same amazing auto-alignment and security as the case. Simply peel the cover off the industrial strength adhesive, line it up and stick it on. If you love your case, this is the ticket.


Note: For the adapter to work properly, your case must have 2.5 x 2.5 inches of flat space on the back of it. Silicone coatings may prevent proper adhesion and due to the large variety of case thicknesses, we cannot promise that Qi charging will work,

Do you run holding your phone? Maybe you shove it into one of those plastic pockets? The SwitchLok Run mount was made for you! Change songs or take a quick picture without stopping--it's so simple. It's also the most comfortable armband you will ever find.  The SwitchLok Run mount has a smooth, curved profile to comfortably rest on your arm. The elastic is soft and smooth, totally different from the stiff, scratchy bands you're used to. We lined the interior of the band with grippy material to keep it comfortably in place.






If you use your phone for navigation or music in the car, you need the SwitchLok Drive mount. Do you ever  wonder if your phone is centered on that cheap magnet or get frustrated by strange clamps to pry apart?  The SwitchLok Drive mount blows everything else out of the water. Not only does it lock your phone securely into portrait or landscape but it automatically aligns it so that it perfectly engages each and every time. It's signature 'click'.

 About our teamAfter finishing my MBA in Dublin, Ireland, I found there was huge demand for smart phone accessories that were both aesthetically pleasing and useful. That’s when Diven, Joy and myself found each other, and created  one company to design and manufacture gadgets.Forcharge is trying to provide the best gadgets and keep them Simple & Portable. We focus on charging stuff like: Portable Charger, Data Cable, Battery Case, Wireless Charging... Where We Started?We started to develop the Blade4000  in 2013 since we launched the 3-in-1 keychain charger in Berlin. The keychain charger was a data-cable, flash drive and charger all in one. . With the success from 3-in-1, we kept hearing the same question: What about my iPhone?In 2014 Apple opened the window for external memory storage (OTG). However they still prohibited any external flash memory. But we heard you the consumers and your need for more space.Where the fund will go?We already have 10K C37 in stock (female Lightning connector) and corresponding chips from Apple’s authorized supplier. The tooling will start with no payment necessary as soon as we pass our goal thanks to our experienced supply chain relationship and control. Now, we are investing in MFi testing, PCBAs, and Battery cells.Risks & ChallengesWe have been at work on Blade4000 and have developed several versions of App and found what works perfect samples for the latest iOS system. The next step for us is to devote securing the MFi certificate which is always tough.Although we have enough experience on simple portable charger and iOS flash drive, we are pioneering the combination of both power and OTG flash memory.. Samples are working perfectly. MFi approval is our biggest issue due to Apple's fussy rules.Regarding the tooling, it is ready for shell.Update for Tooling FinishThe tooling advisement has been finished and just waiting for the trial production. All perks will be shipped in time.

<p>My brother and I had just gotten brand new Nexus 5 phones. Our previous phones had docks built specifically for them, and we had become accustomed to using them in the car. I started looking for a car dock for the Nexus 5 and nothing existed, so I began gathering ideas for how to build my own.</p>
<p>I bought a handful of wireless chargers, car mounts, and other parts, and started hacking them together. After a few days, I had a working car dock for my phone. </p>
<p>I wasn't content with my first attempt. I kept making new ones that were better than the previous. My brother and I would brainstorm new things to try, and then test them on our phones. After a dozen or so iterations, I had a good functioning dock. </p>
<p>It was then that I realized there might be other people who would like a dock like this. I had always wanted to try a crowd funding campaign, so I decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>I knew if I was going to sell the Air Dock, it had to be very polished and work properly. I went through several more versions until I had something I thought was good enough to sell to people. </p>
<p>We reached the funding goal for the first campaign quickly and easily. It was a lot of hard work but we fulfilled the first campaign perks, and even did it on time. The Air Dock was an official success!</p>
<p>During the first campaign, I received some great suggestions from customers about possible avenues of improvement. I was excited to see if I could make the Air Dock even better. After months of working in the shop, I'm pleased to announce that the Air Dock 2.0 directly implements several crucial customer recommendations.</p>
<p>At this point we have perfectly functioning prototypes of the Air Dock 2.0. All we need to get this product into the hands of people all over the world is another successful crowd funding campaign. I was so pleased with the response of the first campaign that I wanted to do it again. I wanted to let the people who are interested in this product fund it, and bring it to market. </p>

</div></div>","Thanks to all our supporters who have made the Air Dock possible.For all things Air Dock, please visit our website at theairdock.comThe Air Dock is a wireless charging station for your mobile device. Simply place your device onto the Air Dock to wirelessly charge!



HOW DOES IT WORK?

The Air Dock is a wireless car charger and dock for smartphones and tablets that are equipped with Qi inductive charging technology, which creates an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two objects, such as your device and The Air Dock.
The face of the Air Dock is made of nano suction foam, so mounting your device is as simple as placing it on the dock. 








The minuscule suction cups secure your phone to the dock without leaving any residue. Magnets hold the device tight to the foam face, allowing for easy removal along with excellent grip strength.







MOUNTING OPTIONSWe like options, so we offer 4 mounting options for the Air Dock 2.0. 



1 - Standard mount for textured surfacesThis is the most versatile mounting option. Its suction cup can be used on many different surfaces. It attaches to textured dashboards, even if they are slightly curved.  
2 - Standard mount for smooth surfacesThis mount is a classic suction cup meant for any flat, smooth surface. It works especially well on windshields.3 - Long flexible mountThis mount has a long, flexible arm that can be bent into many different configurations. It mounts to the windshield or any other flat, glossy surface. 

4 -CD mountThis unique mount is meant to re-purpose your car's CD player. It slips into the CD slot and then expands to hold itself firmly in place.  

DEVICE COMPATIBILITYMany of the newest generation smart phones work on the Air Dock. We are continually testing phones for compatibility as they are released.SUPPORTS MOST NEWER SMART PHONESWe work hard to support as many phones as possible for use on the Air Dock. Every phone is different, and has its own requirements. For a detailed description of what is required for each supported phone please visit the Air Dock device compatibility page. For more info on the Nexus 6 on the Air Dock 2.0 please see the FAQ below.Please make sure you understand exactly what your phone will need to work properly on the Air Dock. If you have questions, feel free to email us at info@theairdock.com before contributing to the campaign.

CASES and THE AIR DOCK 2.0The Air Dock works great with plastic cases that are less than 3mm thick. The nano suction foam works best on glossy surfaces, so we recommend glossy-backed cases.

OPTIONAL MAGNETIC STICKERPhones or cases with non-glossy surfaces, such as satin or other textures, may slip on the nano suction foam. To promote compatibility with as many devices as possible, we provide a magnetic sticker which guarantees reliable attachment to these non-glossy surfaces. Every dock comes with a complementary magnetic sticker, so you can decide whether to use it after trying the dock with your particular phone or case. Visit our website to read more about the magnetic sticker.

I was excited to see if I could make the Air Dock even better. After months of working in the shop, I'm pleased to announce that the Air Dock 2.0 directly implements several crucial customer recommendations.
At this point we have perfectly functioning prototypes of the Air Dock 2.0. All we need to get this product into the hands of people all over the world is another successful crowd funding campaign. I was so pleased with the response of the first campaign that I wanted to do it again. I wanted to let the people who are interested in this product fund it, and bring it to market. 
Lessons Learned from The Air Dock 1.0.The engineering and prototyping phase of the first campaign was nothing new to me, but there were many hard lessons to learn about supply chain timelines and streamlining the manufacturing process. Our plan for the Air Dock 2.0 takes these lessons into account. We are confident we can get this product to you in the timeline we have planned.",21.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><em></em></span></span></span></p>
<blockquote><em>""It leaves me completely stumped why this has to go to the grassroots to get funding. We have seen absolute proof that Process Based Security works in real world scenarios. It is the only thing in all these years for which you can almost give a 99.9999% guarantee that it will not be hacked or otherwise exploited. Yet the marketplace has not embraced PBS and here we are looking for a grassroots movement to step forward to offer an alternative to all the commercially available anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and other 'security' products. This is almost like a David vs Goliath attempt to usurp all those commercial players who reap huge financial windfalls through the marketing of their products - that don't secure anything and always seem to continually need updates and upgrades.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I can understand why 'the security companies' don't want PBS to gain a foothold. They would lose millions of dollars that they reap from end-users. They have a vested interest in seeing PBS disappear.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I can also understand why manufacturers would like to see PBS disappear. The hardware manufacturers are so closely intertwined with the 'security product' vendors and make money on every copy of the 'security products' that they consent to include on their products.</em></blockquote>

<blockquote><em>This attempt to get the grassroots to finallly take charge and arm themselves to storm the commercial security bastille will only work IF the grassroots have reached a point where they have been so thoroughly let down by the commercial players in the past and suffered financial damage or reputation damage.</em></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>First, <strong>YOU, the everyday non-techinically oriented or technically-challenged Android user </strong>is our first priority and preferred target audience.  We feel it is critical that <em><strong>you </strong></em> are among the first to benifit from our revolutionary technology--rescuing you from the daily fear of cyber-crime.  We feel that you should not have to wait on the ""powers that be"" in the technology industry to provide you the cyber security and peace of mind that you deserve and are long overdue to have! <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Secondly, our <em><strong>ultimate goal</strong></em> and target audience for our <strong>SAGESecured</strong> project &amp; product is to rescue <strong>ALL</strong> owners of computer/mobile devices of<strong> ALL operating systems</strong> from the daily imminent danger of cyber-crime, through bringing the market demands of common everyday users to bear on the deisigners, engineers &amp; manufacturers of computer/mobile devices--demanding that they incorporate our <strong>SAGESecured Operating System</strong> fortified with our proven and pantented <strong>Process Based Security (PBS) </strong>into each and every computer/mobile device's core operating system as they come off the factory floor. We believe that the end user will demand that all computers/mobile devices come equipped with our <strong>PB</strong><b>S</b> protocol as standard issued. We also believe it will be the demand of the end user that will ultimately bring an end to tedious retrofitting, aftermarket-afterthought-add-on attempts to provide change control or change prevention.<span><br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>Thirdly, there are <em><strong>gatekeepers to Google Play and other app stores. </strong></em><strong> </strong>We have to introduce those gatekeepers to the fact that the status quo is not as good as it gets.  We also have to show the gatekeepers that it is in their best interests to allow a parallel security model (i.e. one that works) that the gatekeeper can provide at a small premium.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/14488/files/20130815142822-google_play_logo_by_silviu_eduard-d4s7k51.png?1376602102"" src="""" style=""width: 440.1818181818182px; height: 99px;""/></p>
</li>
<li>Finally, once it is established that there is a market appetite for a more reliable, more robust security model then it will be easier to convince the <em><strong>Manufacturers</strong> </em><strong>to deliver their devices with the protocol we provide.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/14496/files/20130815143232-modern-mobile-operating-systems.jpg?1376602352"" src="""" style=""width: 505.1951219512195px; height: 231px;""/></p></strong>
</li>
<li>In the interim there will be a transition period between where we are now as complete sitting ducks to all kinds of cyber threats and where we want to be with devices more secure out of the box.  <strong><em>That interim period will last approximately one product cycle lifetime. <em> </em></em></strong>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal;"">Think about Smart TVs, Smart Watches, Smart Fish Bowls, Smart Anything....as long as it is attached to the Internet it is a sitting duck.  With more and more connectivity to the Internet the model of anti-virus protection becomes less and less attractive.  It is bad enough to have to manage and maintain updates for the desktop, laptop, tablet, etc. Even if anti-virus were reliable, which it has never been, the aggravation of maintaining it is addressed when fixing the underlying cause.  Computer security should never be a ""make work"" proposition.  With our project and introduction of our protocol the underlying problem is fixed and people can deal with other things besides managing and maintaining unreliable updates.  When the Smart House or Smart Car gains traction the problem really needs to be fixed and not just treated.  With more devices being created for the Internet every day, a reliable, permanent solution instead of an ongoing headache of updates begins to make sense.  Our </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><i><b>SAGESecured</b></i></span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal;""> project will also help reclaim the desktop, laptop, tablet etc. from the security treadmill along with all the other Smart devices that are the ""Internet of Things"".  Our project is designed to get more reliable security into the hands of everyone so they can get off the security treadmill of exploit, patch, update....exploit, patch, update....etc.</span></p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the status quo for computer security is not as good as it gets. Properly configured, computers can be more secure than they have ever been since the dawn of the personal computer age. How secure is that? Out of the box they can be delivered permanently immune from that category of exploit involving the surreptitious loading and execution of arbitrary code. That means that spyware, ransomware and all worms, Trojan horses, viruses and similar exploits…<strong>Past, Present AND FUTURE</strong> can be relegated to the dustbin of history. Such exploits can be made irrelevant to all current and future computer users. Future generations of computer users will say “is it true that computers used to drop like flies?”…because such exploits will have become a footnote in history. You can have a major part in hastening the arrival of a more secure computer infrastructure.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><span style=""color: #39a1a6;"">Why Are We Seeking Funding?</span></h2>
<p><strong><em>SAGESecured</em></strong> is 95% complete. It’s almost ready to be introduced to a world where security risks target millions of Android devices every day.  We’re interested in gauging whether or not Android users (and by extension users of other operating systems) are concerned about their device’s security and if they want to do something about it. We’ll use the funding to finalize the system and then bring it to industry leaders of all sorts who will be able to benefit from it. Our goal is to change a big corner of the world of cyber security forever.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to make industry leaders in the network carrier world and handset manufacturing world aware that the status quo is not as good as it gets. In a nutshell we will produce a road show for carriers, manufacturers and financial leaders as well to inform and educate those industry leaders as to how our proven protocol can be used on their behalf as well as on behalf of their end users….specifically you.</p>
<p>The funds collected will specifically be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final Coding Costs</li>
<li>Completing Production of the SAGESecured OS Android Version Prototype.  Making it Available to All Backers Contributing $20 or More by October 2013 to Retrofit their Current Android Devices</li>
<li>Perk Fullfilment</li>
<li>Multi-media Marketing Material Development (Video, Internet, Graphic Design, etc.) Targeting Industry Leaders</li>
<li>PR Campaign Introducing SAGESecured For Android Targeting Android Consumers</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition we will make banks, credit unions and other financial institutions know that mobile banking can be accomplished more reliably and securely with our protocol than can ever be done with conventional best practices.</p>
<p>We have a marketing opportunity to get an initially skeptical but ultimately grateful public aware that there is a preferable alternative to conventional best practices for preventing exploits that involve the loading and execution of arbitrary code. The technology for more secure computers is not in question. After more than two decades of waiting for anti-virus to finally get it right there is a more reliable approach to delivering more control over what a device owner runs and does not run.</p>
<p>Shifting paradigms and changing games is not about the technology. It is about making the world aware that an alternative to the status quo is ready to be deployed to give users a stark choice.

<h2><span style=""color: #39a1a6;"">Why Should You Contribute To The SAGESecured Project?</span></h2>
<p>Why is this protocol useful to the end user?  There are several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>First</strong> it delivers more reliable protection against the surreptitious loading and execution of arbitrary code than anything else currently available. It eliminates from worry a whole category of abuse such as spyware, keystroke loggers, ransomware, Trojan horses, viruses and all manner of exploits that involve the underhanded loading and implementation of arbitrary code. It eliminates not just past and present examples but future ones as well because it deals with the underlying cause of that malware…..not just the symptom. We could stop with this reason alone….that finally there is a reliable approach that does what it is supposed to do…..but there are more reasons.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Secondly</strong>, this approach is more battery friendly than conventional best practices. Remember that a battery powered mobile device only has so much capacity…. Now mobile devices can either run what the owner bought the computer to run or it can run anti-virus software. Currently, battery power that is used to run security applications is not available to run those applications the owner really prefers to have running. With our new protocol the owner of the mobile device gets to use the battery to run the apps that the owner bought the device to run and enjoy.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Thirdly</strong>, funds currently used for subscriptions for security software can be used for other things or saved as the owner of the device chooses.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fourth</strong>, even for static devices that are not battery powered but plugged into the electric grid, the CPU cycles that currently are used to run security software are available to run the applications that the owner prefers to run.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fifth</strong>, you have a lot better chance of protecting your privacy with a change prevention protocol than with conventional best practices.</li>

</p></span></div>","The SAGESecured OS For Android Project Is A Project That The Creator Of Your Currently Flawed Anti-Virus Software Does NOT Want To Succeed!

Let the crusade for more reliable internet security begin! We need YOU, the Android User, to join our world-wide crusade for eliminating cyber-threats & invasions by helping us bring the SAGESecured Operating System project to a reality that will provide the world with the most robust security protocol invented to date by allowing more definative control over what does and does not run on any Android device, permanently eliminating the means and methods that can infect the device with malicious software, PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE. Beginning with Android, SAGESecured serves as a launching pad to bring a new gold standard security protocol to ALL operating systems which are ill-served with conventional best practices.
Marq from Security News Portal explains why our Process Based Security (PBS) protocol is not being embraced by the marketplace and why it will take a grassroots revolution to bring an end to the daily cyber-invasions that threatens our Internet security:

""It leaves me completely stumped why this has to go to the grassroots to get funding. We have seen absolute proof that Process Based Security works in real world scenarios. It is the only thing in all these years for which you can almost give a 99.9999% guarantee that it will not be hacked or otherwise exploited. Yet the marketplace has not embraced PBS and here we are looking for a grassroots movement to step forward to offer an alternative to all the commercially available anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and other 'security' products. This is almost like a David vs Goliath attempt to usurp all those commercial players who reap huge financial windfalls through the marketing of their products - that don't secure anything and always seem to continually need updates and upgrades.
I can understand why 'the security companies' don't want PBS to gain a foothold. They would lose millions of dollars that they reap from end-users. They have a vested interest in seeing PBS disappear.
I can also understand why manufacturers would like to see PBS disappear. The hardware manufacturers are so closely intertwined with the 'security product' vendors and make money on every copy of the 'security products' that they consent to include on their products.
But I really can't understand why the public ( the grassroots ) have not finally reached a level of frustration over the insecurity of hardware and software products that have consistently FAILED to deliver 'security'.
This attempt to get the grassroots to finallly take charge and arm themselves to storm the commercial security bastille will only work IF the grassroots have reached a point where they have been so thoroughly let down by the commercial players in the past and suffered financial damage or reputation damage.
That is about the only way I can imagine this succeeding.""






Who Is Our Target Audience For The SAGESecured Android Operating System? 


First, YOU, the everyday non-techinically oriented or technically-challenged Android user is our first priority and preferred target audience.  We feel it is critical that you  are among the first to benifit from our revolutionary technology--rescuing you from the daily fear of cyber-crime.  We feel that you should not have to wait on the ""powers that be"" in the technology industry to provide you the cyber security and peace of mind that you deserve and are long overdue to have! 

Secondly, our ultimate goal and target audience for our SAGESecured project & product is to rescue ALL owners of computer/mobile devices of ALL operating systems from the daily imminent danger of cyber-crime, through bringing the market demands of common everyday users to bear on the deisigners, engineers & manufacturers of computer/mobile devices--demanding that they incorporate our SAGESecured Operating System fortified with our proven and pantented Process Based Security (PBS) into each and every computer/mobile device's core operating system as they come off the factory floor. We believe that the end user will demand that all computers/mobile devices come equipped with our PBS protocol as standard issued. We also believe it will be the demand of the end user that will ultimately bring an end to tedious retrofitting, aftermarket-afterthought-add-on attempts to provide change control or change prevention.

Thirdly, there are gatekeepers to Google Play and other app stores.  We have to introduce those gatekeepers to the fact that the status quo is not as good as it gets.  We also have to show the gatekeepers that it is in their best interests to allow a parallel security model (i.e. one that works) that the gatekeeper can provide at a small premium.

Finally, once it is established that there is a market appetite for a more reliable, more robust security model then it will be easier to convince the Manufacturers to deliver their devices with the protocol we provide.  

In the interim there will be a transition period between where we are now as complete sitting ducks to all kinds of cyber threats and where we want to be with devices more secure out of the box.  That interim period will last approximately one product cycle lifetime.  





How Long Do We Have To Wait For The SAGESecured Android OS?

The great news is that backers of our SAGESecured project that contribute $20 or more will be the first ones on the planet to have their Android devices SAGESecured! Delivery date for our backers via a secured downloadable link  is late October 2013!  Backers will receive an email containing a link that will allow you to download the SAGESecured Android OS app to your Android device!

During the above mentioned interim period ALL owners of Android devices won't have to wait on computer & smartphone industry companies to responsibly deliver the only robust and reliable security system available to date through incorporation of the SAGESecured OS into every new device coming off the factory floor.  Android users will be able to retrofit their devices NOW (or at least very soon) with the SAGESecured Android OS app.  


Where Will We Be Able To Find The SAGESecured Android OS App?

From Google Play and other app stores.












How Does SAGESecured Work?
Click on the video's play button below to find out!
 
SAGESecured is Process Based Security – a deny-all, permit only-what-the-owner-of-the-system- wants-to-have-running approach to security.  You control what can and can’t happen.  Makes sense, seems simple but it fundamentally changes the way we think of cyber protection. By limiting system access to predetermined processes and by limiting the scope of access to only what is necessary for the process to function, SAGESecured STOPS the execution of malicious programs.  The astute reader will correctly conclude that only allowing predetermined applications is a whitelist.  This is just the beginning for SAGESecured, though.  After mapping all necessary system resources for the application in question, SAGESecured deliberately shuts down any resources in excess of those needed by the predetermined applications.  Malware without access to system resources can do no harm.  To a very real extent the security we provide is a by-product of not allowing system resources to remain available for arbitrary code.

Think about Smart TVs, Smart Watches, Smart Fish Bowls, Smart Anything....as long as it is attached to the Internet it is a sitting duck.  With more and more connectivity to the Internet the model of anti-virus protection becomes less and less attractive.  It is bad enough to have to manage and maintain updates for the desktop, laptop, tablet, etc. Even if anti-virus were reliable, which it has never been, the aggravation of maintaining it is addressed when fixing the underlying cause.  Computer security should never be a ""make work"" proposition.  With our project and introduction of our protocol the underlying problem is fixed and people can deal with other things besides managing and maintaining unreliable updates.  When the Smart House or Smart Car gains traction the problem really needs to be fixed and not just treated.  With more devices being created for the Internet every day, a reliable, permanent solution instead of an ongoing headache of updates begins to make sense.  Our SAGESecured project will also help reclaim the desktop, laptop, tablet etc. from the security treadmill along with all the other Smart devices that are the ""Internet of Things"".  Our project is designed to get more reliable security into the hands of everyone so they can get off the security treadmill of exploit, patch, update....exploit, patch, update....etc.
Remember, computers and the Internet were designed to make life easier.  They were designed to work for the owner, not the other way around...the owner was not intended to work for the computer.




What Is The Current Design Flaw Of All Mobile Devices & Computers That Keeps Your Mobile Devices From Ever Being Truly Secure?
Click on the video's play button below to find out!
 
Strictly speaking, the status quo for computer security is not as good as it gets. Properly configured, computers can be more secure than they have ever been since the dawn of the personal computer age. How secure is that? Out of the box they can be delivered permanently immune from that category of exploit involving the surreptitious loading and execution of arbitrary code. That means that spyware, ransomware and all worms, Trojan horses, viruses and similar exploits…Past, Present AND FUTURE can be relegated to the dustbin of history. Such exploits can be made irrelevant to all current and future computer users. Future generations of computer users will say “is it true that computers used to drop like flies?”…because such exploits will have become a footnote in history. You can have a major part in hastening the arrival of a more secure computer infrastructure.



Why Are We Seeking Funding?
SAGESecured is 95% complete. It’s almost ready to be introduced to a world where security risks target millions of Android devices every day.  We’re interested in gauging whether or not Android users (and by extension users of other operating systems) are concerned about their device’s security and if they want to do something about it. We’ll use the funding to finalize the system and then bring it to industry leaders of all sorts who will be able to benefit from it. Our goal is to change a big corner of the world of cyber security forever.
The funds will be used to make industry leaders in the network carrier world and handset manufacturing world aware that the status quo is not as good as it gets. In a nutshell we will produce a road show for carriers, manufacturers and financial leaders as well to inform and educate those industry leaders as to how our proven protocol can be used on their behalf as well as on behalf of their end users….specifically you.
The funds collected will specifically be used for:

Final Coding Costs
Completing Production of the SAGESecured OS Android Version Prototype.  Making it Available to All Backers Contributing $20 or More by October 2013 to Retrofit their Current Android Devices
Perk Fullfilment
Multi-media Marketing Material Development (Video, Internet, Graphic Design, etc.) Targeting Industry Leaders
PR Campaign Introducing SAGESecured For Android Targeting Android Consumers

In addition we will make banks, credit unions and other financial institutions know that mobile banking can be accomplished more reliably and securely with our protocol than can ever be done with conventional best practices.
We have a marketing opportunity to get an initially skeptical but ultimately grateful public aware that there is a preferable alternative to conventional best practices for preventing exploits that involve the loading and execution of arbitrary code. The technology for more secure computers is not in question. After more than two decades of waiting for anti-virus to finally get it right there is a more reliable approach to delivering more control over what a device owner runs and does not run.
Shifting paradigms and changing games is not about the technology. It is about making the world aware that an alternative to the status quo is ready to be deployed to give users a stark choice. That choice is that they can stay with what is not working now or they can quit being sitting ducks and close the door on THE reason anti-virus does not work.
The technology for more secure computers is not in question. 


Why Should You Contribute To The SAGESecured Project?
Why is this protocol useful to the end user?  There are several reasons.


First it delivers more reliable protection against the surreptitious loading and execution of arbitrary code than anything else currently available. It eliminates from worry a whole category of abuse such as spyware, keystroke loggers, ransomware, Trojan horses, viruses and all manner of exploits that involve the underhanded loading and implementation of arbitrary code. It eliminates not just past and present examples but future ones as well because it deals with the underlying cause of that malware…..not just the symptom. We could stop with this reason alone….that finally there is a reliable approach that does what it is supposed to do…..but there are more reasons.


Secondly, this approach is more battery friendly than conventional best practices. Remember that a battery powered mobile device only has so much capacity…. Now mobile devices can either run what the owner bought the computer to run or it can run anti-virus software. Currently, battery power that is used to run security applications is not available to run those applications the owner really prefers to have running. With our new protocol the owner of the mobile device gets to use the battery to run the apps that the owner bought the device to run and enjoy.


Thirdly, funds currently used for subscriptions for security software can be used for other things or saved as the owner of the device chooses.


Fourth, even for static devices that are not battery powered but plugged into the electric grid, the CPU cycles that currently are used to run security software are available to run the applications that the owner prefers to run.


Fifth, you have a lot better chance of protecting your privacy with a change prevention protocol than with conventional best practices.

<p>The nGroove Snap by Mountek is a revolutionary mount for any mobile device - be it phone, tablet or GPS unit. Its unique design places your phone at the center of your dashboard where you can easily and comfortably see it while driving - right in your CD slot. The effect is a beautiful, seamless, invisible mount that makes your device look like it's ""floating.""</p>
<p><img alt=""Mountek nGroove Snap"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/genejo/IGG_1_HeroShot_3249_800x600_zpsebf4ba44.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mountek nGroove Snap""/>We worked for years to make a mount without any visible or permanent braces, brackets, or clips. The result is a patent pending design with a microblade small enough to fit into the slot of your CD player, narrow enough to hide behind your phone, and sturdy enough to withstand the rockiest of roads.</p>
<p>The way we designed the blade is such that it does not go far enough into your CD slot to activate the CD player mechanism, so that means you can still have a CD in your player while the mount is installed. </p>

<h2>Useful in, Useful out</h2>
<p>When we designed the nGroove Snap, we started with the car and aspired for more. The mount doubles as a portable stand that you can take with you out of the car. </p>
<p><strong>Use it on your desk. </strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Mountek nGroove Snap"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/genejo/Mountek%20Indiegogo/IGG_3_DeskShot_0161_600x400_zpse7c6bdbe.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mountek nGroove Snap""/></p>

<p><strong>Wedge it into any slot. </strong></p>

<h2>How Does It Work? </h2>
<p>1. The nGroove Snap is a 2-piece removable blade system that expands in and out of place with a simple knob. </p>
<p><img alt=""Mountek nGroove Snap prototype"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/genejo/Mountek%20Indiegogo/IGG_6_BladeShot_600x400_zpsf8d11715.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mountek nGroove Snap prototype""/></p>
<p>Note: this is an early prototype of the mount, cast in clear plastic. The final version will be matte black, not clear, and the knob will also be a different design.</p>
<p>2. We supply a low profile badge with a <em>removable, non-permanent</em> adhesive backing for your device. It’s only 0.55mm thin.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mountek nGroove Snap"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/genejo/Mountek%20Indiegogo/IGG_7_ProfileShot_32311_600px_zps73804601.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mountek nGroove Snap""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. The low profile badge snaps to a powerful rare earth magnet that holds your phone or tablet steady. </p>
<p><img alt=""Mountek nGroove Snap"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/genejo/IGG_8_HoldPhoneVideo3_3277_zps1a015d9a.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mountek nGroove Snap""/></p>
<p>Note: the mount is strong enough to hold any phone and most standalone GPS units. It will hold an Apple iPad Mini safely and securely, but we do not recommend mounting a full size Apple iPad as it can become dislodged during sudden bumps in the road because of its weight. We have tested with the full-size iPad with some success, but not consistently enough to recommend its use with the nGroove Snap. </p>
<h2>The Badge</h2>
<p>The low profile badge is what snaps to the magnet on the nGroove Snap. It has a removable, non-permanent adhesive backing that sticks to the back of your device.</p>
<p>If your phone has a case, the badge is thin enough to stick it to the inside of the case for a completely invisible look.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mountek nGroove Snap"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/genejo/Mountek%20Indiegogo/IGG_9_iPhoneCaseShot_0192_600x400_zps2579b568.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mountek nGroove Snap""/></p>
<p>Alternatively, if your device has a removeable battery cover like the Samsung Galaxy S3, the low profile badge is thin enough to stick on the inside of the cover.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mountek nGroove Snap disc inside a Galaxy S3 case"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v313/genejo/IGG_10_CaseShot_3234_600x400_zps5d15903c.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mountek nGroove Snap disc inside a Galaxy S3 case""/></p>
<p>Please note: this is an early testing prototype of the low profile badge and we’re close to finalizing the CMF (color, material, finish). It is not the final production version, which will be smaller and may have a different shape. We’re very picky - if we wouldn’t stick it on our phones, we wouldn’t expect you to stick it on yours, either. We will keep you updated on its progress with photos through the sample production run and welcome any feedback and suggestions.</p>
<p>Each nGroove Snap unit will ship with 2 low profile badges to use with multiple devices. </p>
<p><strong>Please add $2 for each additional badge you'd like to receive.</strong> If you have already contributed, simply increase your contribution accordingly. Each unit will ship with 2 badges, but if you need more just increase your contribution.</p>
<p>Additional badges will also be available after the campaign ends on our website <a href=""http://www.mountek.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mountek.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are Mountek, a 2-person team obsessed with making the best mounts in the universe. To our surprise, our first product wowed journalists like Dan Frakes from <a href=""http://www.techhive.com/article/1164337/twenty_one_overlooked_ios_accessories.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Macworld </a>(“Twenty-one overlooked iOS accessories”), which we sold on eBay. Over the years we’ve gathered many fans from around the world, and the nGroove Snap is our response to the overwhelming encouragement from supporters of our humble beginnings and our quest to make driving safer. </p>

<p>We’ve completed the design for the main blade mount and are ready to complete tooling with a US-based manufacturer. Pending successful funding, we will start production in May with the goal of shipping to backers in July.</p>
<h2>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
<p><strong>What is the badge made out of?</strong><br/>The badge is a blue tempered steel and we’re working hard to get the size, shape, and thinness just right for a perfect, sturdy, hold onto our magnetic mount. It includes a non-permanent adhesive that is easy to remove with no residue left behind – just warm it up with a hair dryer and peel it off.</p>
<p><strong>Will it work with my case?</strong><br/>We’ve been actively testing out a range of cases made of different materials for compatibility. In our tests, hard plastic cases, soft plastic cases, and slim rubber cases all work well. You can easily slip the Mountek metallic badge into cases of many different sizes and shapes.

The nGroove Snap by Mountek is a revolutionary mount for any mobile device - be it phone, tablet or GPS unit. Its unique design places your phone at the center of your dashboard where you can easily and comfortably see it while driving - right in your CD slot. The effect is a beautiful, seamless, invisible mount that makes your device look like it's ""floating.""
We worked for years to make a mount without any visible or permanent braces, brackets, or clips. The result is a patent pending design with a microblade small enough to fit into the slot of your CD player, narrow enough to hide behind your phone, and sturdy enough to withstand the rockiest of roads.
The way we designed the blade is such that it does not go far enough into your CD slot to activate the CD player mechanism, so that means you can still have a CD in your player while the mount is installed. 



Useful in, Useful out
When we designed the nGroove Snap, we started with the car and aspired for more. The mount doubles as a portable stand that you can take with you out of the car. 
Use it on your desk. 

Mount it on a tripod. 

Wedge it into any slot. 

How Does It Work? 
1. The nGroove Snap is a 2-piece removable blade system that expands in and out of place with a simple knob. 

Note: this is an early prototype of the mount, cast in clear plastic. The final version will be matte black, not clear, and the knob will also be a different design.
2. We supply a low profile badge with a removable, non-permanent adhesive backing for your device. It’s only 0.55mm thin.

 
3. The low profile badge snaps to a powerful rare earth magnet that holds your phone or tablet steady. 

Note: the mount is strong enough to hold any phone and most standalone GPS units. It will hold an Apple iPad Mini safely and securely, but we do not recommend mounting a full size Apple iPad as it can become dislodged during sudden bumps in the road because of its weight. We have tested with the full-size iPad with some success, but not consistently enough to recommend its use with the nGroove Snap. 
The Badge
The low profile badge is what snaps to the magnet on the nGroove Snap. It has a removable, non-permanent adhesive backing that sticks to the back of your device.
If your phone has a case, the badge is thin enough to stick it to the inside of the case for a completely invisible look.

Alternatively, if your device has a removeable battery cover like the Samsung Galaxy S3, the low profile badge is thin enough to stick on the inside of the cover.

Please note: this is an early testing prototype of the low profile badge and we’re close to finalizing the CMF (color, material, finish). It is not the final production version, which will be smaller and may have a different shape. We’re very picky - if we wouldn’t stick it on our phones, we wouldn’t expect you to stick it on yours, either. We will keep you updated on its progress with photos through the sample production run and welcome any feedback and suggestions.
Each nGroove Snap unit will ship with 2 low profile badges to use with multiple devices. 
Please add $2 for each additional badge you'd like to receive. If you have already contributed, simply increase your contribution accordingly. Each unit will ship with 2 badges, but if you need more just increase your contribution.
Additional badges will also be available after the campaign ends on our website Mountek.com.
Who are we?
We are Mountek, a 2-person team obsessed with making the best mounts in the universe. To our surprise, our first product wowed journalists like Dan Frakes from Macworld (“Twenty-one overlooked iOS accessories”), which we sold on eBay. Over the years we’ve gathered many fans from around the world, and the nGroove Snap is our response to the overwhelming encouragement from supporters of our humble beginnings and our quest to make driving safer. 

Production Schedule and Delivery
We’ve completed the design for the main blade mount and are ready to complete tooling with a US-based manufacturer. Pending successful funding, we will start production in May with the goal of shipping to backers in July.
FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
What is the badge made out of?The badge is a blue tempered steel and we’re working hard to get the size, shape, and thinness just right for a perfect, sturdy, hold onto our magnetic mount. It includes a non-permanent adhesive that is easy to remove with no residue left behind – just warm it up with a hair dryer and peel it off.
Will it work with my case?We’ve been actively testing out a range of cases made of different materials for compatibility. In our tests, hard plastic cases, soft plastic cases, and slim rubber cases all work well. You can easily slip the Mountek metallic badge into cases of many different sizes and shapes. The thickest case we’ve tested is the Otterbox Defender (see photos - Gallery tab). Even with this thick case, our rare earth magnet is able to snap with the Mountek badge placed inside.
Will the magnet damage NFC chips, memory, GPS, etc?After numerous testing we have not found any damage to NFC, flash memory, gyroscopes, compasses or any other phone component. We have been building and testing this product for over a year and have not come across any issues that we know of.
Can I still charge with Qi or other inductive wireless chargers?Yes, we have tested with a Qi charger and the badge does not affect the phone’s wireless charging capabilities.
Will the badge add any noticeable weight to my device?The two sample badges we produced only weigh 0.13 and 0.16 ounces, respectively. There is no noticeable weight difference.
What if I don’t have a CD slot?The nGroove Snap was designed to wedge into any slot or seam. Although the primary and recommended mounting location is in the CD slot of your dashboard, you can also wedge it into a dashboard seam.

How do I contribute more for additional badges or to add shipping costs?Just add a separate contribution if you need to purchase additional badges ($2 each; unit ships with 2) or forgot to add international shipping. We’ll see that you added a separate contribution.

<h2><strong>Making Communities Safer</strong></h2>
<p>SirenGPS is a start-up working to improve emergency communication and response. Our emergency communication and management software, Siren Emergency, is designed to help schools, hospitals and communities get first responders on the scene faster by connecting your smartphone to emergency services. A free application on your phone lets you share your location with local emergency services that subscribe to Siren Emergency. A paid upgrade to our free application, Siren Safety Circle, lets you share your information and communicate with the people who care about you, connecting friends and family to each other in an emergency.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Siren Emergency:</strong> Siren Emergency turns mass notification into true emergency management. Once a school, university or municipality subscribes to Siren Emergency, individuals in that community will be able to connect with emergency services through location tracking of 911 calls and emergency texts. Siren Emergency helps 911 dispatch and emergency personnel monitor and manage emergencies. Siren's software tracks 911 calls, sends and receives emergency texts and coordinates emergency response with community communication, which means help can come faster and be more effective. Because Siren Emergency is fully interoperable, it lets emergency resources communicate with each other, helping them respond more quickly, especially in large scale emergencies.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Safety Circle Smartphone App:</strong> In a addition to Siren Emergency, Siren also has a paid mobile app, Safety Circle, for sale directly to individuals that you can use to let your friends and family know you are safe, check up on your kids, and talk to each other even when cell service is interrupted -- because our application also works over wireless internet. Safety Circle helps friends and family look out for each other in an emergency. Siren’s Safety Circle allows you to:</p>
<p>• Enable Safety Circle contacts to see your location.</p>
<p>• Automatically send your location to your safety circle when you call 911.</p>
<p>• Automatically share your location and message when you send/receive emergency texts. (Where available)</p>
<p>• Permit Safety Circle contacts to automatically receive notification of your automated alerts regarding dangerous weather, political unrest, etc.</p>
<p>• Tell everyone in your Safety Circle you are OK with one text message, exchanging text messages with your Safety Circle even when cell service is out.</p>
<p>• Turn your phone into a two-way radio to talk to your Safety Circle.</p>
<h2><strong>Getting Siren into Schools, Making Them Safer</strong></h2>
<p>We raised over $400,000 in 2012 to build a prototype and test it in exercises with Boston University. In a December exercise recreating the Aurora, Colorado shooting in Boston University's Bakst Auditorium Siren provided emergency management with caller location, text capability and tactical awareness of people on the scene. Siren provided instant awareness of callers with their location and personal information, shaving three minutes from the standard response time.</p>
<p>Using great feedback we got from the law enforcement community and working with behavioral scientists from Boston University we have come up with the plan to finish building our application. The response from schools and law enforcement has been great!</p>
<p>We are in the process of putting together a Beta program with university, school, municipal and corporate installments of Siren Emergency. The Beta program will run during the Summer of 2013 as we complete our products, and start selling Siren Emergency and Siren Safety Circle. We plan to engage the venture capital community to scale Siren once we are producing revenue. The goal is to grow Siren and extend the benefits of faster emergency response across the country. Your contributions will help us get there.</p>
<h2><strong>School Networking Rewards</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Pre-Purchase Siren Safety Circle and Earn Siren Emergency for your School! </strong></p>
<p><strong>When you pre-purchase Siren Safety Circle for your friends and family, let us know what shool you want to support. Any pre-school, grade school or high school that gets 40 pre-sale Safety Circle subscriptions naming the school will receive Siren Emergency for a year.  </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Did You Know?</strong></h2>
<p>Did you know that you need to tell the 911 operator where you are? Have you ever thought about how nice it would be to send a text in an emergency if you couldn't make a call? Those are the problems we are solving with SirenGPS. We built a prototype and tested it with Boston University. Now we need to turn that prototype into an application you can put on your phone.The Newtown shooting was a horrible tragedy in a series of horrible tragedies and lots of people are looking for answers. Our part of the solution is software that can help police get there faster, saving lives. Virginia Tech, Northern Illinois and other ""Active Shooter"" attacks often end like Newtown: with a perpetrator who is killed or who kills himself when police arrive. Newtown lasted 14 minutes. Emergency dispatch spent ten minutes telling police where to go over RF radio.</p>

However delays and unanticipated development or design issues often come up in software development. Unforeseen issues could delay delivery, or mean different functionality than originally conceived.</p>
<p>Safety Circle, the personal safety reward software associated, does not require your local community to adopt Siren Emergency, our emergency management software platform. However, Safety Circle will do more for you if local police and fire work with Siren so that you can share your location with them. Safety Circle will work great even limited to connecting you to friends and family.</p>
<p>Siren is compliant with all current laws and regulations, and with the Terms of Service for participation in cellular providers and mobile phone manufacturer programs. However, this is an emerging space and the rules are somewhat uncertain. We may not be able to deploy all features on all phones, or in all locations in the future.</p>
