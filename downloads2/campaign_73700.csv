<h3>What is Pandastripes.Org ? <br/>
</h3>
<br/>
Hey you. Yes you! <br/>
</div><p>
Do you want to be a hero and make the world a better place, a place where
people help each other and don`t hate each other? <br/>
<br/>
Awesome! You can do that now! With Pandastripes! <br/>
<br/>
So what exactly is Pandastripes? Well it  is a mix of social network and
a website to meet new friends, kind of like a dating site, but for all kinds of
friends .........and for world peace. <br/>
<br/>
<b>It’s an online-platform where people from different sides of a conflict, who
want to end said conflict, can connect with each other, become friends and
create peace. </b><br/>
<br/>
Okay okay, let me explain from the beginning.  <br/>
My name is Ben I´m from Germany and I think the world could be a much nicer
place than it is at the moment. <br/>
<br/>
Have you watched the news lately? <br/>
We humans usually treat each other very poorly and it seems that we hate each
other for every reason we can find.  <br/>
<br/>
Native inhabitants hating asylum seekers and immigrants, <br/>
Christians demonizing and discriminating homosexuals, <br/>
the eternal conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East.<br/>
<br/>
Conflicts are <b>everywhere</b>. I bet you can name a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
Well I want to make the world a better place, and with your help we can do
that.<br/>
And if you want to make the world a better place you can’t count on the
government, or big organizations. You have to bring the fight to the people.    <br/>
<br/>
Every conflict  has two sides that oppose each other. Like the ones
I listed above.  (Christians and Gays, Native Inhabitants and Asylum
seekers, Israelis and Palestinians, pretty much every religion with every other
religion, you get the point) <br/>
<br/>
The people who want those conflicts are the people who benefit from them. But
they are just the ones who are the loudest.</p><p>
There is a great amount of people who are fed up with all that hate, who
want to reach out, build bridges instead of walls and create peace. 
And those people who put their hands out and reach out to each other are on both
sides of the conflict. <br/>
<br/>
<b>I want to help them connect with Pandastripes.</b>  Pandastripes is a
social network that connects people from two sides of a conflict to form
friendships and make a difference. <br/>
<br/>
The awesome part about this is,<b> you don’t even have to go out of your way to
make a difference. You just do what you love to do anyway.</b> But this time you do
it with people who love the same things as you but happen to be at the other
side of the conflict. <br/>
<br/>
A football fan can look for an asylum seeker or Immigrant who shares his
passion and watch the game together.<br/>
<br/>
A gay guitar player can find a christian bass player to jam together. <br/>
<br/>
An Israeli artist can find a Palestinian artist to do a project together. <br/>
<br/>
Of course this is not only limited to those conflicts, <b>you can use Pandastripes
for every conflict you want</b>. <br/>
<br/>
With Pandastripes you can meet new people, do what you love, and make the world
a better place. Pretty awesome right? <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why it will work: <br/>
</h3>
<p>Big conflicts usually have a narrative of ""US"" vs
""Them""</p>
<p>(In social psychology it’s called Ingroup and Outgroup)  </p>
<p>We tend to have an affinity towards people we perceive as from the same
group as us (ingroup favoritism) and we feel threatened by people we perceive
as not from the same group (outgroup derogation). </p>
<p>The problem with all those big conflicts is that we just focus on the
one big group we are part of, instead of all the tiny other groups. </p>
<p>Yes you may be a Christian, but you are also so much more, a musician, a
gamer and so on. Yet we seem to forget that when it comes to big conflicts. </p>
<p>With Panda we want to bridge that gap and make you focus more on the
little groups you are part of. (Because guess what, if you are a 24 year old
who loves video games you will have more in common with a 24 year old immigrant
who shares your passion than with let’s say, your head of state) </p>
<p>If we focus more on the little groups we are part of, many little bridges
can be build, which bring us closer together and weaken big conflicts. </p>
<p>Another interesting point is that studies show that if a person knows someone
who is gay <b>he is tremendously less likely to discriminate against people with a
different sexual orientation</b>. </p>
<p>That makes of course perfect sense. Since the other group is not a
nameless, faceless group he can’t connect with. He now knows someone of that
group who he likes. So the outgroup is not an outgroup anymore.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>How it works:  <br/>
</h3>
<p>As mentioned Pandastripes.org will be a mix of social network and a site to
meet new people (think of a dating side but not only for dating but for
friends, sports partners, bandmates and all different sorts of people) with the
twist that it focuses on people who are on different sides of a conflict. <br/></p><p>
<br/>
<b>So if you want to reach out it’s easy: </b><br/>
<br/>
1. you create an account on Pandastripes.org<br/>
<br/>
2. You create your page with your information and<br/>
<br/>
3. Tell us which conflict-group you are part of (e.g. Native or Immigrant,
Christian or Gay, Israeli or Palestinian etc.) and <br/>
<br/>
4. What the things are you love. (E.g. Music, Sports, Games, Art etc.) <br/>
<br/>
5. Now you can browse Pandastripes and look for people with your passions, who
are on the other side of the conflict group<br/>
<br/>
6. Meet them, hang out with them, play games with them, do whatever you both
love and make the world a little bit better and the conflict a little bit less
bad.  <br/>
<br/>
<b>You already know that they like the same stuff as you do. And you already know
that they are people who are fed up with hatred and want to reach out and make
friends too. </b><br/>
<br/>
The beauty is that you don’t even have to go out of your way to make the world
a better place. You just do what you love and what you would do anyway, just
with unlikely people. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>What your contribution will
bring: <br/>
</h3>
<p>I need the funding to create this social network.The money is mostly needed for building the platform and keeping it
running. But also to give it a good start, do promotion and get the word out. 

</p><p>This project has the potential to change the world to the better, one
friendship at a time. </p>
<p>A good start is immensely important as the website is nothing without
the people who believe in the idea.  </p>
<p>This project will be a nonprofit, so there is not really anything
produced. But you will still get some cool perks. </p>
<p>First of course you get an awesome website where you can find cool
people to do the things you love with and make the world a better place while
you do it. </p>
<p>That something huh? </p>
<p>The Website will be completely free of course when it’s done. But there
will be paid supporter accounts which have a few different options like
changing their profile site in different ways to make it look cooler. </p>
<p>As a perk for this campaign you can get a yearly and an eternal
supporter account! </p>
<p>You can also grab some of the limited supporter shirts as well. You will
even be able to select what motive you want. It will star our super cute mascot
(Hint: It’s not a giraffe) <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks and Challanges: <br/>
</h3>
<p>There are not too many risks since it’s a pretty straightforward
project.  The only question is: Will people care? </p>
<p>Panda stands and falls with the people. If nobody wants to reach out and
help other people, then we got a problem. But hey you are still here. And you
read this far. So it seems people are interested. I´m sure it’s not just you ;)
</p>
<p>An important aspect is to get the word out as quickly and good as
possible. To draw as much people to Pandastripes as possible. I contacted
several media outlets and planned for additional marketing if necessary in the
budget. I think we have a good chance to make it big.  <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Other ways you can help:  <br/>
</h3>


If you like the idea but you don’t have money to help, I understand. But there
are many other things you could do to help out. <br/>
<br/>
First of all: <b>Tell people!</b> Send this site to all the people that might be
interested, that would be a huge help! <br/>
<br/>
If you want to help in a different way, you are a programmer or a design artist
or anything else that could help or you just want to give me a motivational pat
on the back don’t hesitate and contact me at: <br/>
<br/>
Ben@Pandastripes.org :) <br/>
<br/>Donate a little and get a cool perk! <br/>
Let’s make the world a better place. <br/>
Friendship by friendship :) <br/>
<br/>

<h3>Was ist Pandastripes.Org ? <br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Hey du! Ja, genau du! Willst du die Welt in einen besseren Ort
verwandeln, wo Menschen sich gegenseitig helfen anstatt sich zu hassen? </p>
<p>Sehr gut! Denn das kannst du jetzt, mithilfe von Pandastripes! </p>
<p>Also was genau ist jetzt dieses “Pandastripes.Org”? </p>
<p>Es ist so etwas wie eine Mischung aus einem Sozialen Netzwerk und
einer Website um neue Freunde kennen zu lernen, so etwas wie eine Dating Seite
aber nicht nur für Dating sondern für alle Arten von Freunden…….und für
Weltfrieden. </p>
<p><b>Es ist eine Online-Plattform für einzelne Menschen die auf verschiedenen
Seiten eines großen Konfliktes stehen, den sie beide beenden möchten. Auf
Pandastripes.org bringen wir beide Seiten zusammen, um Freundschaften zu
schließen und Konflikte abzubauen. </b></p>
<p>Okay okay, lass mich von Anfang an erklären! </p>
<p>Ich heiße Ben und ich bin überzeugt davon dass die Welt ein viel
schönerer Ort sein könnte als sie es im Moment ist. </p>
<p>Wenn man die Nachrichten schaut sind es in der Regel keine guten
Nachrichten. <br/>
Wir Menschen behandeln uns gegenseitig ziemlich schlecht, es schein so als
würden wir jeden Grund den wir nutzen können dafür nutzen uns gegenseitig zu
hassen.   <br/>
<br/>
Brandanschläge auf Flüchtlingsunterkünfte in Deutschland,</p>
<p>Christen diskriminieren Schwule und Lesben in den USA, </p>
<p>oder der ewige Konflikt im mittleren Osten.</p>
<p>Nur um einige der unendlich vielen Konflikte zu nennen. <br/>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Ich würde gerne die Welt in eine bessere verändern und mit deiner
Hilfe können wir das schaffen. Und um dies zu tun können wir uns nicht auf die
Regierung oder Organisationen verlassen. Eine bessere Welt fängt mit jedem von
uns an! <br/></p>
<p>Jeder Konflikt hat 2 Seiten die sich ""bekämpfen"". Zum Beispiel
die die ich weiter oben genannt habe.  (Christen und Schwule, “besorgte”
Bürger und Flüchtlinge, Israelis und Palästinenser, so ziemlich jede Religion
und  jede andere Religion, usw usw. Du weißt was ich meine.) <br/>
<br/>
Die Leute die diese Konflikte wollen sind die die davon profitieren,
Extremisten und Mitläufer. Aber diese Leute sind nicht die Mehrheit sondern
lediglich die die am lautesten schreien.</p>
<p>Es gibt eine große Anzahl von Menschen die genug haben von diesen ewigen
Konflikten und diesem ewigen Hass. Menschen die sich die Hände reichen wollen
und endlich Frieden schließen. Und diese Menschen gibt es auf beiden Seiten eines
Konfliktes. </p>
<p><b>Ich will diese Menschen zusammen bringen, mit Pandastripes. </b></p>
<p>Pandastripes ist ein Soziales Netzwerk welches Menschen die genug von
einem Konflikt haben  verbindet, damit diese eine Freundschaft aufbauen
können, und die Welt damit ein bisschen friedlicher machen.  </p>
<p>Das Tolle daran ist, <b>man muss nicht mal irgendetwas anderes machen muss um die
Welt zu verbessern</b>, nur das  was man auch so tun würde. Diesmal tut man es einfach
nur mit anderen Menschen. </p>
<p>Ein Fußballfan kann mit einem Flüchtling der Fußball genauso liebt die
Weltmeisterschaft anschauen gehen. </p>
<p>Ein schwuler Gitarrist kann einen Christlichen Bassisten finden um mit
ihm zusammen Musik zu machen. </p>
<p>Ein Israelischer Künstler kann sich mit einem Palästinensischen Künstler
zusammentun um ein tolles Projekt zu erschaffen. </p>
<p>Natürlich limitiert sich Pandastripes nicht nur auf diese Konflikte.
<b>Pandastripes kann dazu genutzt werden jeden Konflikt zu überbrücken den es
gibt. </b></p>
<p>Mit Pandastripes kannst du neue Leute kennenlernen, mit ihnen zusammen
dass tun was du liebst, und dabei die Welt zum besseren verändern. Ziemlich
cool oder? </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>Warum es funktionieren wird: <br/>
</h3>
<p>Große Konflikte haben für gewöhnlich eine „Wir“ gegen „Die“ Struktur.</p>
<p>(In der Sozialpsychologie nennt man das “Wir” die Eigengruppe und das
“Die” die Fremdgruppe) </p>
<p>Menschen neigen dazu sich zu Menschen hingezogen zu fühlen und diese
besser zu bewerten wenn sie diese als Mitglied der eigenen Gruppe betrachten.
(Ingroup Favouritism). Und sich bedroht zu fühlen von Menschen die sie nicht
als Mitglied der eigenen Gruppe empfinden. (Outgroup Derogation) </p>
<p>Mit Pandastripes schwächen wir diese Dynamik indem wir den Menschen
zeigen dass diese Leute aus der anderen Gruppe eigentlich genau so sind wie
wir. </p>
<p>Das Problem mit diesen Konflikten ist das wir uns nur auf die große
Gruppe in der wir sind Konzentrieren anstatt auf die vielen kleinen Gruppen in
denen wir ebenfalls sind. Ich bin ein junger Deutscher der gerne Computerspiele
spielt, ich habe vermutlich mehr mit einem jungen Syrer der gerne
Computerspiele spielt (oder spielte) zu tun als mit Wolfgang Schäuble. Obwohl
der Wolfgang und ich aus derselben Gegend kommen. </p>
<p>Warum konzentrieren wir uns dann auf die großen Gruppen die so viel
weniger über uns aussagen. Es macht keinen Sinn. Wir sind Teil von so vielen
Gruppen. Gamer, Musiker, Hobbyköche und und und. Warum trennen wir uns über
große Gruppen? </p>
<p>Mit Pandastripes.Org will ich diese Kluft die durch große Gruppen
zwischen uns entsteht überwinden indem ich Menschen aus der gleichen (kleinen)
Gruppe zusammen bringe. </p>
<p><b>Wenn wir viele kleine Brücken bauen, zwischen Musikern, Künstlern, Gamern,
Sportfans usw. Dann wird uns das näher zusammenbringen und wir können Stück für
Stück Konflikte bewältige. </b></p>
<p>Hier ist noch etwas Interessantes: </p>
<p>Wusstest du das viele Studien gezeigt haben das Menschen die jemanden
kennen der Homosexuell ist wesentlich seltener Schwule diskriminieren.</p>
<p>Das ist natürlich nur logisch. Die andere Gruppe ist jetzt nichtmehr
eine Anonyme namen- und gesichtslose „böse“ Gruppe zu der man keinen Bezug hat.
Wenn du jemanden aus der Gruppe kennst den du magst, dann ist die Fremdgruppe
gar nicht mehr so fremd. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>Wie Pandastripes funktioniert: <br/>
</h3>
<p>Wie schon erwähnt wird Pandastripes.Org eine Mischung aus Sozialem
Netzwerk und einer Seite um neue Leute kennen zu lernen. Mit dem Unterschied
das Panda darauf abzielt das diese neuen Leute von der anderen Seite eines
Konfliktes kommen. <br/>
Also wenn du jemandem die Hand reichen willst um einen Konflikt zu beenden ist
das jetzt einfacher als je zuvor: <br/>
<br/>
1. Du erstellst einen Account auf Pandastripes.org<br/>
<br/>
2. Du erstellst ein Profil und erzählst etwas über dich und…<br/>
<br/>
3. gibst an auf welcher Seite du von welchem Konflikt stehst (z.B. Bürger oder
Flüchtling, Christ oder Homosexuell, Israeli oder Palästinenser etc.) danach…<br/>
<br/>
4. Was die Dinge sind die du Liebst. (z.B. Musik, Sport, Games, Kunst etc.) <br/>
<br/>
5. Jetzt kannst schon losgehen, du kannst auf Pandastripes Leute suchen die
deine Interessen teilen und auf der anderen Seite des Konfliktes sind. </p>
<p>6. Triff dich mit ihnen und tut was ihr beide gern macht, schaut das Fußballspiel,
macht eine Lanparty, macht Musik, was immer es auch ist, tut es und sorgt dafür
dass die Welt dabei ein Stück näher zusammen rückt. Ganz automatisch.</p>
<p>Du weißt schon von vorneherein das die Leute das gleiche toll finden wie
du und das sie auch die Hand ausstrecken. Du musst sie nur noch nehmen. </p>
<p>Und dann musst du nicht mal etwas tun was du nicht sowieso schon tun
würdest. Du machst etwas das du liebst mit neuen Freunden. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>Was dein Beitrag erreichen wird: <br/>
</h3>
<p>Ich brauche Unterstützung um Pandastripes Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen.
</p>
<p>Das Geld wird hauptsächlich dafür benötigt die Plattform im Web zu
schaffen und sie am Laufen zu halten. Aber auch um Panda einen guten Start zu
ermöglichen. Also z.B. für eventuell nötige Werbung. </p>
<p>Das Projekt hat das Potential die Welt zum Bessern zu verändern. Ein
guter Start ist immens wichtig denn die Website wird nur so stark werden wie
die Leute die sich uns anschließen.</p>
<p>Das Projekt ist gemeinnützig. D.h. Es wird nichts Produziert. Trotzdem
wird es ein paar coole Perks geben wenn ihr Panda unterstützt. </p>
<p>Hier ist was ihr bekommen könnt: </p>
<p>Zuerst einmal eine Hammer Website wo ihr coole Leute treffen könnt und
mit ihnen die Dinge tun die ihr gerne tut. Und dabei ganz nebenbei die Welt
verbessern. </p>
<p>Das ist doch schon mal was, oder? </p>
<p>Wenn Pandastripes online ist wird es selbstverständlich komplett
kostenlos sein. Aber um unsere Kosten zu decken wird es Unterstützer-Accounts
geben. Diese werden zusätzliche Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten Ihres Profils haben.</p>
<p>Hier könnt ihr jährliche und sogar lebenslange Support-Accounts
bekommen.</p>
<p>Außerdem könnt ihr begrenzt erhältliche Supporter-Shirts bekommen. Ihr
könnt euch sogar das Motiv aussuchen. Darauf wird unser super süßes Maskottchen
zu sehen sein (Pro Tipp: ich verrate noch nicht was es ist, aber es ist keine
Giraffe) </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>Risiken und Nebenwirkungen: <br/>
</h3>
<p>Es gibt nicht viele Risiken da die Plattform Idee eigentlich recht
einfach ist. Die einzige Frage ist: Wird sich jemand dafür interessieren? Gibt
es genug Leute die sich die Hände reichen wollen? </p>
<p>Panda steht und fällt mit den Leuten. Falls niemand die Welt zu einem
besseren Ort machen will haben wir ein Problem. Aber wenn man sich die
Hilfsbereitschaft die die deutsche Bevölkerung den Flüchtlingen entgegen
gebracht hat anschaut denke ich es gibt genug gute Menschen. Und außerdem hast
du auch schon so weit nach unten gelesen, du bist bestimmt nicht der einzige ;)
</p>
<p>Ein wichtiger Aspekt für den Erfolg von Panda ist es, es bekannt zu
machen. Menschen müssen wissen was Pandastripes.Org ist und das sie hier
anderen die Hand reichen können. Um Pandastripes so bekannt wie möglich zu
machen habe ich mehrere Pressestellen kontaktiert, sowohl konventionelle als
auch im Internet. Außerdem habe ich im Budget für eventuell nötiges Marketing
geplant. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>Andere Wege zu helfen: <br/>
</h3>
<p>Vielleicht findest du die Idee klasse, hast aber nicht viel Geld. Kein Problem,
es gibt andere Möglichkeiten wie du helfen kannst: </p>
<p>Zu aller erst: Rede darüber! Sende diese Seite allen Leuten die sich
dafür interessieren könnten. </p>
<p>Das kostet dich nichts, hilft uns aber extrem weiter. Wenn du aktiv
mithelfen möchtest, und du ein Programmierer, Designer oder irgendwas anderes
bist das helfen könnte, oder du mir auch nur sagen möchtest was du über
Pandastripes denkst (oder du einfach nur „Hi“ sagen willst) , zögere nicht mir
zu schreiben : </p>

What is Pandastripes.Org ? 


Hey you. Yes you! 

Do you want to be a hero and make the world a better place, a place where
people help each other and don`t hate each other? 

Awesome! You can do that now! With Pandastripes! 

So what exactly is Pandastripes? Well it  is a mix of social network and
a website to meet new friends, kind of like a dating site, but for all kinds of
friends .........and for world peace. 

It’s an online-platform where people from different sides of a conflict, who
want to end said conflict, can connect with each other, become friends and
create peace. 

Okay okay, let me explain from the beginning.  
My name is Ben I´m from Germany and I think the world could be a much nicer
place than it is at the moment. 

Have you watched the news lately? 
We humans usually treat each other very poorly and it seems that we hate each
other for every reason we can find.  

Native inhabitants hating asylum seekers and immigrants, 
Christians demonizing and discriminating homosexuals, 
the eternal conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East.

Conflicts are everywhere. I bet you can name a lot more.

Well I want to make the world a better place, and with your help we can do
that.
And if you want to make the world a better place you can’t count on the
government, or big organizations. You have to bring the fight to the people.    

Every conflict  has two sides that oppose each other. Like the ones
I listed above.  (Christians and Gays, Native Inhabitants and Asylum
seekers, Israelis and Palestinians, pretty much every religion with every other
religion, you get the point) 

The people who want those conflicts are the people who benefit from them. But
they are just the ones who are the loudest.
There is a great amount of people who are fed up with all that hate, who
want to reach out, build bridges instead of walls and create peace. 
And those people who put their hands out and reach out to each other are on both
sides of the conflict. 

I want to help them connect with Pandastripes.  Pandastripes is a
social network that connects people from two sides of a conflict to form
friendships and make a difference. 

The awesome part about this is, you don’t even have to go out of your way to
make a difference. You just do what you love to do anyway. But this time you do
it with people who love the same things as you but happen to be at the other
side of the conflict. 

A football fan can look for an asylum seeker or Immigrant who shares his
passion and watch the game together.

A gay guitar player can find a christian bass player to jam together. 

An Israeli artist can find a Palestinian artist to do a project together. 

Of course this is not only limited to those conflicts, you can use Pandastripes
for every conflict you want. 

With Pandastripes you can meet new people, do what you love, and make the world
a better place. Pretty awesome right? 

Why it will work: 

Big conflicts usually have a narrative of ""US"" vs
""Them""
(In social psychology it’s called Ingroup and Outgroup)  
We tend to have an affinity towards people we perceive as from the same
group as us (ingroup favoritism) and we feel threatened by people we perceive
as not from the same group (outgroup derogation). 
The problem with all those big conflicts is that we just focus on the
one big group we are part of, instead of all the tiny other groups. 
Yes you may be a Christian, but you are also so much more, a musician, a
gamer and so on. Yet we seem to forget that when it comes to big conflicts. 
With Panda we want to bridge that gap and make you focus more on the
little groups you are part of. (Because guess what, if you are a 24 year old
who loves video games you will have more in common with a 24 year old immigrant
who shares your passion than with let’s say, your head of state) 
If we focus more on the little groups we are part of, many little bridges
can be build, which bring us closer together and weaken big conflicts. 
Another interesting point is that studies show that if a person knows someone
who is gay he is tremendously less likely to discriminate against people with a
different sexual orientation. 
That makes of course perfect sense. Since the other group is not a
nameless, faceless group he can’t connect with. He now knows someone of that
group who he likes. So the outgroup is not an outgroup anymore.
How it works:  

As mentioned Pandastripes.org will be a mix of social network and a site to
meet new people (think of a dating side but not only for dating but for
friends, sports partners, bandmates and all different sorts of people) with the
twist that it focuses on people who are on different sides of a conflict. 

So if you want to reach out it’s easy: 

1. you create an account on Pandastripes.org

2. You create your page with your information and

3. Tell us which conflict-group you are part of (e.g. Native or Immigrant,
Christian or Gay, Israeli or Palestinian etc.) and 

4. What the things are you love. (E.g. Music, Sports, Games, Art etc.) 

5. Now you can browse Pandastripes and look for people with your passions, who
are on the other side of the conflict group

6. Meet them, hang out with them, play games with them, do whatever you both
love and make the world a little bit better and the conflict a little bit less
bad.  

You already know that they like the same stuff as you do. And you already know
that they are people who are fed up with hatred and want to reach out and make
friends too. 

The beauty is that you don’t even have to go out of your way to make the world
a better place. You just do what you love and what you would do anyway, just
with unlikely people. 
What your contribution will
bring: 

I need the funding to create this social network.The money is mostly needed for building the platform and keeping it
running. But also to give it a good start, do promotion and get the word out. 

This project has the potential to change the world to the better, one
friendship at a time. 
A good start is immensely important as the website is nothing without
the people who believe in the idea.  
This project will be a nonprofit, so there is not really anything
produced. But you will still get some cool perks. 
First of course you get an awesome website where you can find cool
people to do the things you love with and make the world a better place while
you do it. 
That something huh? 
The Website will be completely free of course when it’s done. But there
will be paid supporter accounts which have a few different options like
changing their profile site in different ways to make it look cooler. 
As a perk for this campaign you can get a yearly and an eternal
supporter account! 
You can also grab some of the limited supporter shirts as well. You will
even be able to select what motive you want. It will star our super cute mascot
(Hint: It’s not a giraffe) 
Risks and Challanges: 

There are not too many risks since it’s a pretty straightforward
project.  The only question is: Will people care? 
Panda stands and falls with the people. If nobody wants to reach out and
help other people, then we got a problem. But hey you are still here. And you
read this far. So it seems people are interested. I´m sure it’s not just you ;)

An important aspect is to get the word out as quickly and good as
possible. To draw as much people to Pandastripes as possible. I contacted
several media outlets and planned for additional marketing if necessary in the
budget. I think we have a good chance to make it big.  
Other ways you can help:  



If you like the idea but you don’t have money to help, I understand. But there
are many other things you could do to help out. 

First of all: Tell people! Send this site to all the people that might be
interested, that would be a huge help! 

If you want to help in a different way, you are a programmer or a design artist
or anything else that could help or you just want to give me a motivational pat
on the back don’t hesitate and contact me at: 

Ben@Pandastripes.org :) 
Donate a little and get a cool perk! 
Let’s make the world a better place. 
Friendship by friendship :) 

Ben.

Deutsche Beschreibung:


Was ist Pandastripes.Org ? 


Hey du! Ja, genau du! Willst du die Welt in einen besseren Ort
verwandeln, wo Menschen sich gegenseitig helfen anstatt sich zu hassen? 
Sehr gut! Denn das kannst du jetzt, mithilfe von Pandastripes! 
Also was genau ist jetzt dieses “Pandastripes.Org”? 
Es ist so etwas wie eine Mischung aus einem Sozialen Netzwerk und
einer Website um neue Freunde kennen zu lernen, so etwas wie eine Dating Seite
aber nicht nur für Dating sondern für alle Arten von Freunden…….und für
Weltfrieden. 
Es ist eine Online-Plattform für einzelne Menschen die auf verschiedenen
Seiten eines großen Konfliktes stehen, den sie beide beenden möchten. Auf
Pandastripes.org bringen wir beide Seiten zusammen, um Freundschaften zu
schließen und Konflikte abzubauen. 
Okay okay, lass mich von Anfang an erklären! 
Ich heiße Ben und ich bin überzeugt davon dass die Welt ein viel
schönerer Ort sein könnte als sie es im Moment ist. 
Wenn man die Nachrichten schaut sind es in der Regel keine guten
Nachrichten. 
Wir Menschen behandeln uns gegenseitig ziemlich schlecht, es schein so als
würden wir jeden Grund den wir nutzen können dafür nutzen uns gegenseitig zu
hassen.   

Brandanschläge auf Flüchtlingsunterkünfte in Deutschland,
Christen diskriminieren Schwule und Lesben in den USA, 
oder der ewige Konflikt im mittleren Osten.
Nur um einige der unendlich vielen Konflikte zu nennen. 


Ich würde gerne die Welt in eine bessere verändern und mit deiner
Hilfe können wir das schaffen. Und um dies zu tun können wir uns nicht auf die
Regierung oder Organisationen verlassen. Eine bessere Welt fängt mit jedem von
uns an! 
Jeder Konflikt hat 2 Seiten die sich ""bekämpfen"". Zum Beispiel
die die ich weiter oben genannt habe.  (Christen und Schwule, “besorgte”
Bürger und Flüchtlinge, Israelis und Palästinenser, so ziemlich jede Religion
und  jede andere Religion, usw usw. Du weißt was ich meine.) 

Die Leute die diese Konflikte wollen sind die die davon profitieren,
Extremisten und Mitläufer. Aber diese Leute sind nicht die Mehrheit sondern
lediglich die die am lautesten schreien.
Es gibt eine große Anzahl von Menschen die genug haben von diesen ewigen
Konflikten und diesem ewigen Hass. Menschen die sich die Hände reichen wollen
und endlich Frieden schließen. Und diese Menschen gibt es auf beiden Seiten eines
Konfliktes. 
Ich will diese Menschen zusammen bringen, mit Pandastripes. 
Pandastripes ist ein Soziales Netzwerk welches Menschen die genug von
einem Konflikt haben  verbindet, damit diese eine Freundschaft aufbauen
können, und die Welt damit ein bisschen friedlicher machen.  
Das Tolle daran ist, man muss nicht mal irgendetwas anderes machen muss um die
Welt zu verbessern, nur das  was man auch so tun würde. Diesmal tut man es einfach
nur mit anderen Menschen. 
Ein Fußballfan kann mit einem Flüchtling der Fußball genauso liebt die
Weltmeisterschaft anschauen gehen. 
Ein schwuler Gitarrist kann einen Christlichen Bassisten finden um mit
ihm zusammen Musik zu machen. 
Ein Israelischer Künstler kann sich mit einem Palästinensischen Künstler
zusammentun um ein tolles Projekt zu erschaffen. 
Natürlich limitiert sich Pandastripes nicht nur auf diese Konflikte.
Pandastripes kann dazu genutzt werden jeden Konflikt zu überbrücken den es
gibt. 
Mit Pandastripes kannst du neue Leute kennenlernen, mit ihnen zusammen
dass tun was du liebst, und dabei die Welt zum besseren verändern. Ziemlich
cool oder? 

Warum es funktionieren wird: 

Große Konflikte haben für gewöhnlich eine „Wir“ gegen „Die“ Struktur.
(In der Sozialpsychologie nennt man das “Wir” die Eigengruppe und das
“Die” die Fremdgruppe) 
Menschen neigen dazu sich zu Menschen hingezogen zu fühlen und diese
besser zu bewerten wenn sie diese als Mitglied der eigenen Gruppe betrachten.
(Ingroup Favouritism). Und sich bedroht zu fühlen von Menschen die sie nicht
als Mitglied der eigenen Gruppe empfinden. (Outgroup Derogation) 
Mit Pandastripes schwächen wir diese Dynamik indem wir den Menschen
zeigen dass diese Leute aus der anderen Gruppe eigentlich genau so sind wie
wir. 
Das Problem mit diesen Konflikten ist das wir uns nur auf die große
Gruppe in der wir sind Konzentrieren anstatt auf die vielen kleinen Gruppen in
denen wir ebenfalls sind. Ich bin ein junger Deutscher der gerne Computerspiele
spielt, ich habe vermutlich mehr mit einem jungen Syrer der gerne
Computerspiele spielt (oder spielte) zu tun als mit Wolfgang Schäuble. Obwohl
der Wolfgang und ich aus derselben Gegend kommen. 
Warum konzentrieren wir uns dann auf die großen Gruppen die so viel
weniger über uns aussagen. Es macht keinen Sinn. Wir sind Teil von so vielen
Gruppen. Gamer, Musiker, Hobbyköche und und und. Warum trennen wir uns über
große Gruppen? 
Mit Pandastripes.Org will ich diese Kluft die durch große Gruppen
zwischen uns entsteht überwinden indem ich Menschen aus der gleichen (kleinen)
Gruppe zusammen bringe. 
Wenn wir viele kleine Brücken bauen, zwischen Musikern, Künstlern, Gamern,
Sportfans usw. Dann wird uns das näher zusammenbringen und wir können Stück für
Stück Konflikte bewältige. 
Hier ist noch etwas Interessantes: 
Wusstest du das viele Studien gezeigt haben das Menschen die jemanden
kennen der Homosexuell ist wesentlich seltener Schwule diskriminieren.
Das ist natürlich nur logisch. Die andere Gruppe ist jetzt nichtmehr
eine Anonyme namen- und gesichtslose „böse“ Gruppe zu der man keinen Bezug hat.
Wenn du jemanden aus der Gruppe kennst den du magst, dann ist die Fremdgruppe
gar nicht mehr so fremd. 

Wie Pandastripes funktioniert: 

Wie schon erwähnt wird Pandastripes.Org eine Mischung aus Sozialem
Netzwerk und einer Seite um neue Leute kennen zu lernen. Mit dem Unterschied
das Panda darauf abzielt das diese neuen Leute von der anderen Seite eines
Konfliktes kommen. 
Also wenn du jemandem die Hand reichen willst um einen Konflikt zu beenden ist
das jetzt einfacher als je zuvor: 

1. Du erstellst einen Account auf Pandastripes.org

2. Du erstellst ein Profil und erzählst etwas über dich und…

3. gibst an auf welcher Seite du von welchem Konflikt stehst (z.B. Bürger oder
Flüchtling, Christ oder Homosexuell, Israeli oder Palästinenser etc.) danach…

4. Was die Dinge sind die du Liebst. (z.B. Musik, Sport, Games, Kunst etc.) 

5. Jetzt kannst schon losgehen, du kannst auf Pandastripes Leute suchen die
deine Interessen teilen und auf der anderen Seite des Konfliktes sind. 
6. Triff dich mit ihnen und tut was ihr beide gern macht, schaut das Fußballspiel,
macht eine Lanparty, macht Musik, was immer es auch ist, tut es und sorgt dafür
dass die Welt dabei ein Stück näher zusammen rückt. Ganz automatisch.
Du weißt schon von vorneherein das die Leute das gleiche toll finden wie
du und das sie auch die Hand ausstrecken. Du musst sie nur noch nehmen. 
Und dann musst du nicht mal etwas tun was du nicht sowieso schon tun
würdest. Du machst etwas das du liebst mit neuen Freunden. 

Was dein Beitrag erreichen wird: 

Ich brauche Unterstützung um Pandastripes Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen.

Das Geld wird hauptsächlich dafür benötigt die Plattform im Web zu
schaffen und sie am Laufen zu halten. Aber auch um Panda einen guten Start zu
ermöglichen. Also z.B. für eventuell nötige Werbung. 
Das Projekt hat das Potential die Welt zum Bessern zu verändern. Ein
guter Start ist immens wichtig denn die Website wird nur so stark werden wie
die Leute die sich uns anschließen.
Das Projekt ist gemeinnützig. D.h. Es wird nichts Produziert. Trotzdem
wird es ein paar coole Perks geben wenn ihr Panda unterstützt. 
Hier ist was ihr bekommen könnt: 
Zuerst einmal eine Hammer Website wo ihr coole Leute treffen könnt und
mit ihnen die Dinge tun die ihr gerne tut. Und dabei ganz nebenbei die Welt
verbessern. 
Das ist doch schon mal was, oder? 
Wenn Pandastripes online ist wird es selbstverständlich komplett
kostenlos sein. Aber um unsere Kosten zu decken wird es Unterstützer-Accounts
geben. Diese werden zusätzliche Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten Ihres Profils haben.
Hier könnt ihr jährliche und sogar lebenslange Support-Accounts
bekommen.
Außerdem könnt ihr begrenzt erhältliche Supporter-Shirts bekommen. Ihr
könnt euch sogar das Motiv aussuchen. Darauf wird unser super süßes Maskottchen
zu sehen sein (Pro Tipp: ich verrate noch nicht was es ist, aber es ist keine
Giraffe)

Es gibt nicht viele Risiken da die Plattform Idee eigentlich recht

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Once Upon A Sleepover is a sleepover planning and rental service that was started in Buffalo, NY last May. We had just one goal at that time and that to provide children an amazing sleepover. With our tents, lights, trays, and decor we wanted to make sure everyone could have the ultimate sleepover experience. This business started off as just a dream for us and has grown as the months went by making this our reality. With the help of my family, friends, and social media following Once Upon A Sleepover was born and sleepovers will NEVER be the same. Our first party launched May 5th, 2017 and went viral in two days. So far we have done over 60 parties since opening. We have even been featured on Yahoo!, BuzzFeed, The Talk of Alabama and a few other places.  We have reached all of our short term goals thus far and now need your help reaching our final goal. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help of turning our dream of having a physical location into a reality! We believe all children should experience the joy of a sleepover at least once in their lifetime. We have turned the concept of a sleepover around and supersized it. Providing the decor, bedding, and all you need to have the sleepover of your dreams, is what makes Once Upon A Sleepover an easy party option for parents. Once Upon A Sleepover was created by moms to help other parents relax and while we create sweet dreams and memories for you and your child. </p>
<p>Right now our biggest obstacle is finding a venue for our parents to host our amazing sleepovers. Currently we use hotels and often times we have to move the furniture, are not allowed to set up due to hotel policies, the space is not big enough, or parents are not able to afford the party and additional cost for the hotel. Sometimes parents will have the space in their house, but after moving the furniture around it makes getting around for activities hard. </p>
<p>Our dream and solution to our biggest problem (customers not having space) is just a simple fix. We need a building! With your donations Once Upon A Sleepover will be able to lease commercial space, not only giving our customers an affordable space to host their sleepovers, but also helping one of our dreams come become reality. Having a space to host sleepovers will reduce stress, be more cost effective, and provide a space for us to host other children themed events such as etiquette classes. </p>
<p>Your donation will go to the lease of this beautiful we have fallen in love with. It will also help to furnish this space to make it our own. The remaining funds will go to the first few months of bills we will now be responsible like gas, electric, and insurance. Any donation is appreciated and will go 100 % into our business growth. </p>
<p>For helping us obtain our goal we have several perks available like Once Upon A Sleepover water bottles, T-Shirts, VIP tickets to our grand opening, and more. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, and we understand that! You can still help by spreading the word and sharing this campaign on your social media sites. We appreciate even the smallest gesture. </p>

<h3>Creating a Business out of my Passion </h3>
<p>I want to create something from nothing! <br/>My passion is making videos and in the past 1,5 years, I've managed to generate over 6 million views on my YouTube channel (youtube.com/applepieofficial) and I would like to grow my passion into a larger business.</p>
<p>For this to happen I need my own studio and headquarters to host my operations. </p>
<p>In this new studio I will be able to generate daily content in 2 languages (English and Hungarian) for two youtube channels that are related to technology, also boost my video production agency's sales and generate more leads and potential customers.</p>
<p>This unique studio will help me create unique and engaging videos for new and returning customers. </p>
<p>My 3 YouTube channels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple PIE (youtube.com/applepieofficial) – Tech channel in Hungarian with 60,000 Subscribers</li>
<li>Joe Ritter (youtube.com/joeritter) Personal English Youtube channel with 10,000 Subscribers</li>
<li>BROduction (youtube.com/broductionbp) Professional video production agency </li>
</ol>
<p>While currently Apple PIE the second largest tech channel in Hungary. I plan to make videos on all three channels.</p>
<p>Creating videos and professional advertisements, mood videos is also a goal and this studio will help generate interest towards that company. Currently, we have 8 clients to who we generate engaging videos on a monthly basis. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED A NEW STUDIO?</strong></p>
<p>In order to create cool and engaging content, a studio and HQ has to be set up where we can generate and edit all the content. </p>
<ul>
<li>I have decided to move my studio to my family and to my hometown Székesfehérvár</li>
<li>In the new studio there is a possibility to have 10 different locations, green screen environment, and unique recording and photo booths to help diversify our portfolio and have more clients, create cool looking youtube videos and continue the growth of the channels. </li>
</ul>
<p>I am asking for help online because in Hungary there are not many possibilities for young entrepreneurs to get sponsored in the beginning phase of their business. I have already put all of my savings to create my dream studio because I believe there is much potential in this region and there is a high demand for video region. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need $10,000 for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finishing the upgrades on the electrical system in the house to make the environment safe.</li>
<li>The house was built in the 1980's and there had to be many renovations done with the walls and ceiling. The floor has yet to be completed and an evenly level floor is needed for the carpets to be sufficiently placed down. </li>
<li>Currently, there is no heating and we would need electrical heaters along with an AC to keep the temperature at a comfortable level all year round. It is important if we have clients or businesses coming over to do video or photo shoots in a comfortable environment. </li>
<li>Custom tables and desks are necessary to fit into the corners and the designs to make whole room look appealing and 'video worthy' </li>
<li>Decorations and minor equipment upgrades are necessary to have the best results in video production.</li>
<li>We would need a green screen area to be placed on the main walls so we can fulfill any kinds of video requirements. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your contribution I will be able to:</p>
<ul>

</div></div>","Creating a Business out of my Passion 
I want to create something from nothing! My passion is making videos and in the past 1,5 years, I've managed to generate over 6 million views on my YouTube channel (youtube.com/applepieofficial) and I would like to grow my passion into a larger business.
For this to happen I need my own studio and headquarters to host my operations. 
In this new studio I will be able to generate daily content in 2 languages (English and Hungarian) for two youtube channels that are related to technology, also boost my video production agency's sales and generate more leads and potential customers.
This unique studio will help me create unique and engaging videos for new and returning customers. 
My 3 YouTube channels:

Apple PIE (youtube.com/applepieofficial) – Tech channel in Hungarian with 60,000 Subscribers
Joe Ritter (youtube.com/joeritter) Personal English Youtube channel with 10,000 Subscribers
BROduction (youtube.com/broductionbp) Professional video production agency 

While currently Apple PIE the second largest tech channel in Hungary. I plan to make videos on all three channels.
Creating videos and professional advertisements, mood videos is also a goal and this studio will help generate interest towards that company. Currently, we have 8 clients to who we generate engaging videos on a monthly basis. 
 
WHY WE NEED A NEW STUDIO?
In order to create cool and engaging content, a studio and HQ has to be set up where we can generate and edit all the content. 

I have decided to move my studio to my family and to my hometown Székesfehérvár
In the new studio there is a possibility to have 10 different locations, green screen environment, and unique recording and photo booths to help diversify our portfolio and have more clients, create cool looking youtube videos and continue the growth of the channels. 

I am asking for help online because in Hungary there are not many possibilities for young entrepreneurs to get sponsored in the beginning phase of their business. I have already put all of my savings to create my dream studio because I believe there is much potential in this region and there is a high demand for video region. 

We need $10,000 for:

Finishing the upgrades on the electrical system in the house to make the environment safe.
The house was built in the 1980's and there had to be many renovations done with the walls and ceiling. The floor has yet to be completed and an evenly level floor is needed for the carpets to be sufficiently placed down. 
Currently, there is no heating and we would need electrical heaters along with an AC to keep the temperature at a comfortable level all year round. It is important if we have clients or businesses coming over to do video or photo shoots in a comfortable environment. 
Custom tables and desks are necessary to fit into the corners and the designs to make whole room look appealing and 'video worthy' 
Decorations and minor equipment upgrades are necessary to have the best results in video production.
We would need a green screen area to be placed on the main walls so we can fulfill any kinds of video requirements. 


The Impact
With your contribution I will be able to:

Generate content daily for my followers in two languages
I will be able to educate my audience with propres how to videos
I will be able to soley focus on my passion wich is my business
I will be able to create new jobs in my hometown and hire young and talented staff whose passion is creating videos.

<div>I am an <a href=""http://www.waynestadlerphotography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">experienced photographer</a> and road tripper.

I won't be able to get everywhere, but I'm sure willing to try. Another thing to note is that any funds raised by donations, sponsorship, hired commissions and my own art photography print sales along the way will all be applied to the longevity of this project.</div>

<div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Over the past three years the reaction to the portraits I do at Burning Man has been simply overwhelming.

To capture fun, creative memories with everyday people, for whatever reason they may have that is close to them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I also feel the stories and images will not only serve those that they are created for with a lasting memory but in sharing them remind us all that we as people are all one, all in this world together, striving for the same things. That is why I ask that everyone follow along on this journey with me via the website and social media. I may be the one out there doing this, but this project is for and about all of us.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>I feel my biggest risk is going to be that of breakdown or theft of some kind. This <i>isn't</i>  my first road trip and I'm going into this project with as much preparation done as possible but that does not cover the unforeseen. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've driven cross country (Canada) during the winter and throughout the southwest states in all conditions. I have experience with breakdowns, flat tires and accidents and it's all part of the deal.  I know what the road feels like and I know my limitations. I can deal with the isolation it sometimes brings but look forward to the interactions of making artful photographic memories with new friends. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As for challenges, the one I stress over is finding the willing participants. People can be prideful, shy and private. I understand this and want to assure everyone involved that I pass no judgement on anyone's situation. I’ve been in many dire situations myself in which I received help from dear friends and family.

FotosForward is a traveling photography project gifting creative photography sessions and important memories across North America to those with limited income or going through financial hardships, people with limited mobility or who may live in rural/remote areas with limited access to a professional photographer. 

I am an experienced photographer and road tripper. In 2012 I attended the Burning Man festival. I built a small towable cart and did portraits of other attendees.

 The Impact
Over the past three years the reaction to the portraits I do at Burning Man has been simply overwhelming. It was amazing to me how a simple gift of a few still frames could garner so much gratitude from the recipient. I've been wanting to bring that gift to the rest of the world for some time. To capture fun, creative memories with everyday people, for whatever reason they may have that is close to them.

    Risks & Challenges
I feel my biggest risk is going to be that of breakdown or theft of some kind. This isn't  my first road trip and I'm going into this project with as much preparation done as possible but that does not cover the unforeseen. 

I've driven cross country (Canada) during the winter and throughout the southwest states in all conditions. I have experience with breakdowns, flat tires and accidents and it's all part of the deal.  I know what the road feels like and I know my limitations. I can deal with the isolation it sometimes brings but look forward to the interactions of making artful photographic memories with new friends. 

As for challenges, the one I stress over is finding the willing participants. People can be prideful, shy and private. I understand this and want to assure everyone involved that I pass no judgement on anyone's situation. I’ve been in many dire situations myself in which I received help from dear friends and family.

Without sharing it with your friends it doesn't get seen, without eyes on it there are no participants, no connections, no stories, no photos. The more people that see this project, share the website, the Facebook page and the tweets the better of a chance I have of filling each day with meaningful shoots.

Apart from the fact that this Stylish Foldable Paper Table can fit the needs of small homes with insufficient space, the special characteristics of this paper table like artistic appearance, high mobility, easy for storage and user friendliness surely make it very suitable to be used in commercial occasions such as restaurants, exhibition venues, etc. With the continuous hard work and perseverance of mine and the support of my family and friends, I made the first sample successfully but there are still many imperfections needed to be solved before the Stylish Foldable Paper Table can become a mature product for mass production. For example, it's still not very easy to open the table now, the side paper broad of the table will get crumple easily and not good-looking enough because of the velcro. That's the reason why we raise funds here and hope that we can raise enough funds to optimize the design and manufacture of this Stylish Foldable Paper Table.Contributors are also welcome to give comments or constructive suggestions to improve the Stylish Foldable Paper Table design.1.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Teangla Caprice Jackson.  I am the mother of six children and a child care provider.</p>
<p>In 2003, I became a licensed childcare professional with my own center.  I provided before and after care for children six weeks to twelve years old from 6am to 12am.  I also offered transportation to and from school as well as to children's homes.  For four years my business grew and flourished as well as my family.  When I started the business, my three children were ages five, nine and twelve.  Within three of those years I gave birth to two more children.  It was time to move my family and my child care center to a larger space.  My plans were not God's plans.  Unfortunately, my family experienced a financial hardship that required me to close my business and re-enter the workforce.  I continued working in various child care centers all the while longing for my own again. I noticed how differences in the quality of care in the various centers I was employed.  Children from inner city neighborhoods were given care that was lacking in not only supervision but also in resources while other centers flourished with resources for families that were able to pay a steep price for such luxuries.  It was then, that I knew that time was of the essence.  I want to address the disparities of families with low income and the quality of care that their children are provided.  All children deserve the best care possible without regard to their family's income restraints and I would like to fill this void with quality, nourishing, developmentally appropriate child care for all children.  That's where this campaign comes in.  I am striving to raise funds to open a center where children and their families are nurtured and cared for.  Where the development of the whole child is manifested through activities and resources that target cognitive, social/emotional, and physical skills while at the same time providing a quality of care that some families are not privy to.  It is my goal to use the funds from this campaign to buy a building and/or space to open Ready, Set, Grow! Child Care and Family Resource Center.  We would provide quality and affordable child care for children six weeks to twelve years with the addition of before and after school care, transportation to and from school, and Summer Camp! This is such a labor of love for me.  With your help, I will be able to open a child care center that will be the foundation of my mission of serving all children and their families.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $100,000 to help me with this endeavor.  Even if I don't reach my $100,000 goal, all money will go towards opening the child care center of my dreams.  A child care center that is truly needed in our community.</p>
<p>For everyone that contributes there are fun perks in store!  If you want to help but can't contribute money, word of mouth advertising of my campaign would be greatly appreciated as well!</p>

</p><p>Greetings,</p>
<p>My
name is Bethany Palmer.  I’m an attorney from Flagstaff, Arizona. 
I’ve spent the past three years working with a legal aid that provides free
legal services to low-income people around Arizona and in the Navajo
Nation.  This fall, I’m heading to Guayaquil, Ecuador to provide legal
services and community education to refugees.  I will be volunteering with
a wonderful non-profit organization called Asylum Access América Latina.<span>  If you would like to learn more about Asylum
Access América Latina, please visit their website: 
<a href=""http://asylumaccess.org/AsylumAccess/mission-and-vision/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://asylumaccess.org/AsylumAccess/mission-an...</a>.</span></p>
<p>There
are many refugees in Ecuador from neighboring Colombia as well as numerous
refugees fleeing the humanitarian and security crisis in Central America. 
These individuals are fleeing their countries for a variety of reasons;
political oppression, gender-based violence and targeted gang violence, to name
a few.  Asylum Access América Latina seeks to ensure that these
individuals’ rights are respected as they live in Ecuador and go through the
United Nations’ process to determine whether they are refugees.  </p>
<p>In
addition to providing refugees with sorely needed legal services, this move
will help me transition to the next stage in my career, in which I plan to
focus primarily on refugee and asylum law.  This experience will increase
my understanding of the issues that refugees face as they are awaiting
decisions, resettlement and family reunification.  I know I will become a
better lawyer, while learning about different cultures and perspectives.  </p>
<p>While
my current position as a legal aid attorney is extremely rewarding, the rewards
are not financial.  I have not been able to set aside enough funds to last
through six months of volunteering.  As much as I hate asking for help, in
this instance, I must.   </p>
<p>My
fundraising target is $4,800.  This is to cover travel expenses to
Ecuador, visa expenses, daily living expenses including housing, food,
transportation and medical insurance.  Every bit counts.  If you can
throw in $5 or $10, it would be greatly appreciated, and will get me that much
closer to my goal.<span>  Together we can help
the refugees in Ecuador.  Thank you very
much for your support! </span></p>

<p><strong>Ayude a la Provisión de los Servicios Legales a los Refugiados en
Ecuador</strong></p>
<p>Me llamo Bethany Palmer.<span>  Soy
abogada de Flagstaff, Arizona.  He pasado
los tres últimos años trabajando en una defensoría que ayuda a la gente de
pocos recursos de Arizona y de la Nación Navajo.  Este otoño, voy a Guayaquil, Ecuador para
proveer servicios legales y educación comunitaria a los refugiados. Seré

<br/></div>","Greetings,
My
name is Bethany Palmer.  I’m an attorney from Flagstaff, Arizona. 
I’ve spent the past three years working with a legal aid that provides free
legal services to low-income people around Arizona and in the Navajo
Nation.  This fall, I’m heading to Guayaquil, Ecuador to provide legal
services and community education to refugees.  I will be volunteering with
a wonderful non-profit organization called Asylum Access América Latina.  If you would like to learn more about Asylum
Access América Latina, please visit their website: 
http://asylumaccess.org/AsylumAccess/mission-an....
There
are many refugees in Ecuador from neighboring Colombia as well as numerous
refugees fleeing the humanitarian and security crisis in Central America. 
These individuals are fleeing their countries for a variety of reasons;
political oppression, gender-based violence and targeted gang violence, to name
a few.  Asylum Access América Latina seeks to ensure that these
individuals’ rights are respected as they live in Ecuador and go through the
United Nations’ process to determine whether they are refugees.  
In
addition to providing refugees with sorely needed legal services, this move
will help me transition to the next stage in my career, in which I plan to
focus primarily on refugee and asylum law.  This experience will increase
my understanding of the issues that refugees face as they are awaiting
decisions, resettlement and family reunification.  I know I will become a
better lawyer, while learning about different cultures and perspectives.  
While
my current position as a legal aid attorney is extremely rewarding, the rewards
are not financial.  I have not been able to set aside enough funds to last
through six months of volunteering.  As much as I hate asking for help, in
this instance, I must.   
My
fundraising target is $4,800.  This is to cover travel expenses to
Ecuador, visa expenses, daily living expenses including housing, food,
transportation and medical insurance.  Every bit counts.  If you can
throw in $5 or $10, it would be greatly appreciated, and will get me that much
closer to my goal.  Together we can help
the refugees in Ecuador.  Thank you very
much for your support!

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Rochester, NY hides a robust art community. With 8 colleges and universities in the Rochester area(more within a 50-mile radius), street art everywhere, artisan shops that line the streets and open-mics galore it's weird that an art community of this size is unrecognized and unrepresented Since March 2017, <a href=""http://www.projectvisualnw.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Project Visual Network</a> has been connecting like-minded artists from all different backgrounds in the Rochester community. At our core, we strive to immerse our artists in an environment of passionate artists looking to connect, collaborate and create.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512573584/fqoqdw9cjotinbi7irpl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Social Proof</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The demand is real. The Project Visual Network currently partners 5 Visual Artists with a social media following over 15000 fans and growing! <br/>We had our first event, Project: LAUNCH, in March in which we pulled in over 100 attendees and paid out over $350 to our artists, Just for that single night! That happened with no money, just the power of art and word of mouth. <br/>We help our artists host events and experiences for themselves so our second event, a partnered musicians album release party, just happened in November and was out of this world. You can read <a href=""http://www.projectvisualnw.com/blog/i-wanna-makeout-recap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our blog post about it here</a>! We at the Project Visual Network believe in, fund and market our artists and are surrounded by a community who loves their art and are willing to pay for it. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512574775/fwy7k8e07pjd2l7v0pfs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So many times, we have heard<strong> “Art isn’t a stable job”</strong> or <strong>“I wish I could pursue my dream but I don’t have the resources to do it”</strong> and we actively challenge that opinion! If you want something badly enough, <strong>you go out and do it!</strong> Gather the knowledge needed to build your brand, surround yourself with other people passionate about your art, find resources and get it done! But for people who don't know where that process starts, that’s where the startup company, <strong>Project Visual</strong>, comes in. The Project Visual Network is working hard to get to a point where we can more steadily provide resources and funding for <strong>all our</strong> <strong>emerging new visual artists-models, filmmakers, fashion designers, graphic artist, musicians, etc. It all, kinda, starts here!</strong>  <strong>This campaign will help provide a more stable foundation for Project Visual and our content creators.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With the help of our supporters and contributors, we can create a better foundation for providing funding and resources to the artists powering the art of tomorrow. Assist us in destroying the stereotype about careers in art as we get people to see that an art/entertainment career is more achievable than  you think!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are ALWAYS looking for ways to give back to our supportive community, whether that be digitally or the community right here in Rochester, NY. If you can monetarily support our campaign, we'd love to express our gratitude with a piece of our 1-year history, discount codes to affiliate stores, credits and more!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We would love if our goal was met but if it isn't we won't stop pushing! All efforts raised will go into our prioritized budgets and will aid us in creating a foundation for our environment where we support our artists!</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The younger me was so eager to create art.</strong> I wanted to run my own production company and I even took a year off, right after graduating valedictorian of my high school with scholarships to many GOOD schools, to do it. Self-sustaining myself on minimum wage while trying to invest in my business was hard so unfortunately, I had to rethink my situation.

Rochester, NY hides a robust art community. With 8 colleges and universities in the Rochester area(more within a 50-mile radius), street art everywhere, artisan shops that line the streets and open-mics galore it's weird that an art community of this size is unrecognized and unrepresented Since March 2017, the Project Visual Network has been connecting like-minded artists from all different backgrounds in the Rochester community. At our core, we strive to immerse our artists in an environment of passionate artists looking to connect, collaborate and create.

Social Proof
The demand is real. The Project Visual Network currently partners 5 Visual Artists with a social media following over 15000 fans and growing! We had our first event, Project: LAUNCH, in March in which we pulled in over 100 attendees and paid out over $350 to our artists, Just for that single night! That happened with no money, just the power of art and word of mouth. We help our artists host events and experiences for themselves so our second event, a partnered musicians album release party, just happened in November and was out of this world. You can read our blog post about it here! We at the Project Visual Network believe in, fund and market our artists and are surrounded by a community who loves their art and are willing to pay for it. 

 
So many times, we have heard “Art isn’t a stable job” or “I wish I could pursue my dream but I don’t have the resources to do it” and we actively challenge that opinion! If you want something badly enough, you go out and do it! Gather the knowledge needed to build your brand, surround yourself with other people passionate about your art, find resources and get it done! But for people who don't know where that process starts, that’s where the startup company, Project Visual, comes in. The Project Visual Network is working hard to get to a point where we can more steadily provide resources and funding for all our emerging new visual artists-models, filmmakers, fashion designers, graphic artist, musicians, etc. It all, kinda, starts here!  This campaign will help provide a more stable foundation for Project Visual and our content creators.
With the help of our supporters and contributors, we can create a better foundation for providing funding and resources to the artists powering the art of tomorrow. Assist us in destroying the stereotype about careers in art as we get people to see that an art/entertainment career is more achievable than  you think!
 


The goal we're trying to reach is $5,500. Here's a further breakdown of where the money is actually going:

We are ALWAYS looking for ways to give back to our supportive community, whether that be digitally or the community right here in Rochester, NY. If you can monetarily support our campaign, we'd love to express our gratitude with a piece of our 1-year history, discount codes to affiliate stores, credits and more!
We would love if our goal was met but if it isn't we won't stop pushing! All efforts raised will go into our prioritized budgets and will aid us in creating a foundation for our environment where we support our artists!


The Impact
The younger me was so eager to create art. I wanted to run my own production company and I even took a year off, right after graduating valedictorian of my high school with scholarships to many GOOD schools, to do it. Self-sustaining myself on minimum wage while trying to invest in my business was hard so unfortunately, I had to rethink my situation. This led me to go to college to further my education while still retaining this goal in mind. Into my academic career, I began to meet like-minded artists with the same intent in mind-make my art my job. Likewise, these artists had a hard time funding their art, marketing themselves effectively or understanding the business more in depth, all while going to school or working long hours. Hence, Project Visual was born, an opportunity where I could make my own dreams come true while helping others achieve the same thing. From then on out I’ve worked hard inside and outside of school to build the network and bring Project Visual, the manifestation of my previous goal, to life and IT HAS!


Risks & Challenges
There is some risk in our business; art is subjective so what makes our artists stand out? How does the Project Visual Network become self-sustaining? Here's how we plan on tackling these questions: 

It's definitely true, art is subjective. In considering this, we push our artists to be persistent and just keep creating. In the meantime, we work in the background gauging interest, holding focus groups, sending out surveys, reviewing social media analytics growth and social trends and more. With our strenuous research and development from our team, we maximize the opportunities within the target markets for our partnered artists. 

The Project Visual Network contracts every artist looking to join our community. Within these contracts we negotiate profit margin percentages only on creations or opportunities we help our artist fund or we collaborate on. We've been working on so many projects with so many artists that we'd love to bring to life!
We host amazing events all year long! These events are unique and different and target multiple demographics and markets. We believe that with the correct advertising and marketing, but most importantly creating an engaging genuinely immersive experience, we can fund the network while pursuing other business opportunities that'll only expand it more.

In the meantime, we've reached a small but steady following from Salem, Polk County and Washington County families who find our little play place worth the drive.  We feel like we could be on the brink of expanding to the steady numbers that will support Imagine: Play, but have run out of ability to make the further investments needed to push past the three year barrier.</p>
<p>We've identified three issues that we can solve to bring in a higher rate of attendance and with it a sustaining income.  With this campaign we ask our community for the additional investment needed to address those, pushing us past year three and solidly into year four.  Help us continue to be a part of the Yamhill County community, and here for our neighbors in Washington, Marion and Polk Counties as well.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Imagine: Play's attendance levels are good when the weather is bad, and bad when the weather is good.  Offering an outdoor play area will solve this warm weather problem. We've gained permission to cordon off an area just outside the big bay doors where we can place sandboxes and ride-on toys.  This addition will bring in families and consistent income, providing a long-term solution.</p>
<p>The second portion of our campaign is aimed at solving the problem of too few people knowing that Imagine: Play exists.  Improved signage on the building, official ODOT tourist attraction signs on the highway and a cost effective ""gap coverage"" Highway 18 billboard plus increased advertising will help us reach more families both in Yamhill County and in neighboring counties, </p>
<p>The last portion of our campaign involves catching up on assorted replacements and improvements, as well as investing in services to streamline processes.  This will free the owner/manager to focus on adding features and events that will increase patronage and with it, business income.  Having new themed play areas rotate in and out, and organizing events such as Pirate Day and Science Night will keep our offerings fresh and new, and our guests interested in returning regularly.</p>
<p>Our campaign is almost entirely reward-based.  We  believe in the win-win situation, in offering a worthwhile value.  Although there is a place for simple cash contributions, our focus is on perks that will have meaning and value for your investment.</p>
<p>Breakdown of our ambitious funding goal:</p>
<p></p>
<p>$8,800 Outdoor play area</p>
<p>$7,100 Improved signage on building, ODOT highway signs, one year advertising budget and purchase
a ‘gap placement’ highway 18 billboard ad</p>
<p>$2,500 Replace Bounce House </p>
<p>$3,600 One year cleaning service</p>
<p>$3,200 Insurance</p>
<p>$1,200 One year online booking calendar with payment processing and credit/debit card processing service</p>
<p>$1,200 Indoor additions and replacements</p>(See the comments for further description of each category)<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><b>By Investing, You Join Our Team</b></p>
<p>Our family has funded this and worked hard to be here offering
unplugged, healthy fun for Yamhill County Families for nearly three years.  Our team of volunteers has been generous with
their time, helping expand our open play hours so there are more opportunities
to come learn and bond through play. 
Imagine: Play provides an important outlet for development and growth in
the ways that kids naturally learn- through social, creative and active play.  Will you help us complete year three and launch
into year four on a steady base, and answer that need for an outdoor space? I
hope you can join our family and team, and help continue this wonderful place to gather, play, bond and grow.</p>
<p><b>Our Last Ditch Effort </b></p>
<p>Without a successful campaign, Imagine: Play will close for good on May 9th. This is when our business license expires, and shortly after our insurance runs out.  It is also when we can anticipate income will once again drop below the levels needed to even cover basic non-labor monthly expenses.

</div></div>","Let's Keep Imagine: Play Around for Year 4 and Beyond! Imagine: Play began as an idea just over three years ago of providing a local, unplugged play place where children and families could gather to bond through play.  The question our family gambled on was that Yamhill County is large enough to support a user-fee supported play place.  However, we've reached nearly three years of being open, and the business has yet to be able to cover labor costs or even consistently cover all operating expenses. In the meantime, we've reached a small but steady following from Salem, Polk County and Washington County families who find our little play place worth the drive.  We feel like we could be on the brink of expanding to the steady numbers that will support Imagine: Play, but have run out of ability to make the further investments needed to push past the three year barrier.
We've identified three issues that we can solve to bring in a higher rate of attendance and with it a sustaining income.  With this campaign we ask our community for the additional investment needed to address those, pushing us past year three and solidly into year four.  Help us continue to be a part of the Yamhill County community, and here for our neighbors in Washington, Marion and Polk Counties as well.   What We Need & What You Get Imagine: Play's attendance levels are good when the weather is bad, and bad when the weather is good.  Offering an outdoor play area will solve this warm weather problem. We've gained permission to cordon off an area just outside the big bay doors where we can place sandboxes and ride-on toys.  This addition will bring in families and consistent income, providing a long-term solution.
The second portion of our campaign is aimed at solving the problem of too few people knowing that Imagine: Play exists.  Improved signage on the building, official ODOT tourist attraction signs on the highway and a cost effective ""gap coverage"" Highway 18 billboard plus increased advertising will help us reach more families both in Yamhill County and in neighboring counties, 
The last portion of our campaign involves catching up on assorted replacements and improvements, as well as investing in services to streamline processes.  This will free the owner/manager to focus on adding features and events that will increase patronage and with it, business income.  Having new themed play areas rotate in and out, and organizing events such as Pirate Day and Science Night will keep our offerings fresh and new, and our guests interested in returning regularly.
Our campaign is almost entirely reward-based.  We  believe in the win-win situation, in offering a worthwhile value.  Although there is a place for simple cash contributions, our focus is on perks that will have meaning and value for your investment.
Breakdown of our ambitious funding goal:

$8,800 Outdoor play area
$7,100 Improved signage on building, ODOT highway signs, one year advertising budget and purchase
a ‘gap placement’ highway 18 billboard ad
$2,500 Replace Bounce House 
$3,600 One year cleaning service
$3,200 Insurance
$1,200 One year online booking calendar with payment processing and credit/debit card processing service
$1,200 Indoor additions and replacements(See the comments for further description of each category)    
By Investing, You Join Our Team
Our family has funded this and worked hard to be here offering
unplugged, healthy fun for Yamhill County Families for nearly three years.  Our team of volunteers has been generous with
their time, helping expand our open play hours so there are more opportunities
to come learn and bond through play. 
Imagine: Play provides an important outlet for development and growth in
the ways that kids naturally learn- through social, creative and active play.  Will you help us complete year three and launch
into year four on a steady base, and answer that need for an outdoor space? I
hope you can join our family and team, and help continue this wonderful place to gather, play, bond and grow.
Our Last Ditch Effort 
Without a successful campaign, Imagine: Play will close for good on May 9th. This is when our business license expires, and shortly after our insurance runs out.  It is also when we can anticipate income will once again drop below the levels needed to even cover basic non-labor monthly expenses. We still have a small amount of debt owed from covering last year's annual insurance payment plus May's lease and other expenses that we could not pay when the weather turned wonderful in April- and lasted for seven months.  This makes us unable to incur additional debt to invest any more. The business must be built to a level that will allow a small salary for a part time manager as well.  Three year's worth of donating our time and terming it 'sweat equity' is our limit.  A paid manager is reasonable and essential;  even non-profits do not rely solely on volunteer labor.

<p>Hello! My name is Linda Boudousquie, and I'm the owner of the Dark Entry, an alternative fashion and jewelry store in Berkeley. I’ve owned the store for about  17 years now after it opened in New Orleans in 1999—those first five years were some of my best. The store made enough money to open a second location in Berkeley and I thought everything was going to work out great—but then Hurricane Katrina had her say. In one night, that first store that I had put so much of my effort into was taken away. I had to put everything into a desperate relocation to the new store in Berkeley—a store that was barely up and running and hadn’t turned a profit yet. Making it work was my only option though, so that’s what I did.</p>
<p>After several years building my business back up from square one, things were starting to look promising again—and then I was struck by a drunk driver in 2008. My hip was fractured in three places and I couldn't walk for almost four months. Without any employees, and minimal support, I somehow managed to keep the store just above water. The money I got from the insurance companies covered my medical bills, but it didn’t make much a dent in the months of rent and credit card debt the business had incurred. I never once thought about giving up; the road to recovery for me and my store looked hard, but it was my only option, so I went.</p>
<p>By 2011 I still hadn't managed to pay off all of the store’s debts, but I was chipping away at them! Retail everywhere was slower than ever, but I was catering to a wonderful niche of customers in Berkeley that were looking for things they couldn’t yet easily find on the internet. I couldn’t afford to hire any new employees, but with help from family and friends, I started working on a new website to reach more customers on the internet. The weight of all the debt I was carrying, however, along with death in the family and my mother getting a diagnosis of cancer that year, left me in a daze. I was completely overwhelmed, and by the end of that year, I had fallen $40,000 behind on rent.</p>
<p>I finally found the strength to pull things together and get the store back on track again, and even managed to pay off half of the past-due rent last month, but an ultimatum from my landlord came down today: pay off the remaining $20,000 in the next 15 days, or close our doors forever. I was losing hope after I heard that, up until one of my customers pointed out that The Dark Entry has over 58,000 fans following our Facebook page, and that if even half of you are willing to donate just $1, it won't be the end!</p>
<p>I really need your help, and I will give everyone who offers it something in return: every one of you that loves this store enough to support will receive a gift card for 20-25% more than the amount of their donation, as well as thank you letters written by me personally! Every gift card will be transferable with no expiration date and will be honored online as soon as the store is back on its feet again. I really appreciate you taking the time to read this plea for help. Thank all of you who find it in your hearts to make a donation!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Linda Boudousquie<br/>Owner, The Dark Entry</p>

<p>Our concept is to create specialty gift boxes (Isla’s Box) for any special occasion or holiday.        (Weddings, Birthdays, New Baby, Christmas,  Mother's day, Father's day, New home,  etc..) </p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>No ads, no network communication</b> - like the current Encrypted Notepad, this will be a stand-alone application, not a ""cloud"" service. You are in control where you save your files (even if you do end up saving them on Dropbox or something like it - your choice remains your own).</li>
<li>
<b>Open source</b> - like the current version, you can inspect what I did (or pay someone else to inspect it) and be sure that what I'm saying here is actually what appears in the code. Licensed under the BSD license. Will appear on GitHub.</li>
<li>
<b>A standardized file format</b> - the current version saves files in a custom format. The new version will save in the PGP ""ASCII-armoured"" format, which can be opened by 3rd party applications. While doing this, I also want to make the app more robust, fixing bugs present in the current version.</li>
<li>
<b>Desktop and Android versions</b> - I firmly believe there is a need to share encrypted data between the desktop and the mobile devices. The actual way this sharing is to happen is up to you - either do it manually or use an external service.</li>
<li>
<b>User interface improvements</b> - it's fair to say that the 2010. version of Encrypted Notepad had an UI which is ... rudimentary ... to say the least. I want to make it more usable. Meaning: a modern look, better <i>Find</i> function, easier way to navigate between multiple documents.</li>
</ol>
<div>It goes without saying that I will not compromise on the security. Only standard algorithms and practices will be used for encryption, like AES-256-CBC and SHA-256. If you don't know what it means, simply be at ease that no experimentation will occur. This is familiar territory for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><h3>Why should you trust me?</h3><div>People who consciously use encryption are often those who are acutely aware of the concept and the problems associated with <i>trust</i>. When you choose to trust me, you can do it for any of the following reasons:</div><div>
<ul>
<li>I'm an experienced systems developer, working on operating systems and with <a href=""https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributors/staff-committers.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kernel development experience</a> for 10+ years.</li>
<li>Encryption is a personal and professional interest to me, and I have a history of small-scale <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/ivoras/pgenctypes/wiki/Home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">encryption</a> <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/ivoras/rsalogin/wiki/Home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">projects</a>. The most important thing I've learned here is to be careful and avoid experimentation in the implementation.</li>
<li>I will also use Encrypted Notepad 2 daily.</li>
</ul>
<div>So give me a shout and if you want a better, more convenient encrypted notepad for yourself and the society at large, think about backing this project!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Timeline and deliverables</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">This crowdfunding campaign lasts 2 months (60 days), which means I will start working on the project by Summer 2015. You should expect the first usable version of Encrypted Notepad 2 soon after, and at most by Fall.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Long story short, you and the world will get a simple text editor (think ""Notepad"") which saves to the PGP native "".asc"" encrypted file format, with symmetric encryption.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">This new version is to have all the features from this document, plus whatever is suggested by the users with contributor perks and whatever other features become convenient during the initial development. </span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The features will be implemented as a desktop (Java, Cross-platform) application and as an Android mobile device application.</div>
<div>Stretch-goals, if reached, will include making an iOS application.</div>

What are you doing about it?

Hello, everyone!

I've written the original Encrypted Notepad in 2010, because I had an itch to scratch: I needed a convenient, easy to use and uncomplicated way to write down information I wanted kept secret. I also needed these encrypted files to be in sync with my Android-based mobile phone.I didn't want to use external command-line tools, large applications, complex protocols, or anything else which would distract me from the simple workflow of:

Write some text
Hit Ctrl-S to save it, enter a password

No fuss, no unnecessary clicks, no problems.
So I wrote it in the shortest time possible and without big plans, and it apparently became a reasonably popular product in its category. It works on Windows, OS X and Linux, as well as on Android. 5 years later, it is still downloaded around 50 times a week (based on SourceForge's metrics). Think about it - software which is 5 years old and hadn't received almost no updates, and it's still getting used!It's high time I did a decent update for it!Here's what I'm promisingI basically want to do a complete rewrite, a new version of Encrypted Notepad, with the following headlining features:


No ads, no network communication - like the current Encrypted Notepad, this will be a stand-alone application, not a ""cloud"" service. You are in control where you save your files (even if you do end up saving them on Dropbox or something like it - your choice remains your own).

Open source - like the current version, you can inspect what I did (or pay someone else to inspect it) and be sure that what I'm saying here is actually what appears in the code. Licensed under the BSD license. Will appear on GitHub.

A standardized file format - the current version saves files in a custom format. The new version will save in the PGP ""ASCII-armoured"" format, which can be opened by 3rd party applications. While doing this, I also want to make the app more robust, fixing bugs present in the current version.

Desktop and Android versions - I firmly believe there is a need to share encrypted data between the desktop and the mobile devices. The actual way this sharing is to happen is up to you - either do it manually or use an external service.

User interface improvements - it's fair to say that the 2010. version of Encrypted Notepad had an UI which is ... rudimentary ... to say the least. I want to make it more usable. Meaning: a modern look, better Find function, easier way to navigate between multiple documents.

It goes without saying that I will not compromise on the security. Only standard algorithms and practices will be used for encryption, like AES-256-CBC and SHA-256. If you don't know what it means, simply be at ease that no experimentation will occur. This is familiar territory for me.

Why should you trust me?People who consciously use encryption are often those who are acutely aware of the concept and the problems associated with trust. When you choose to trust me, you can do it for any of the following reasons:

I'm an experienced systems developer, working on operating systems and with kernel development experience for 10+ years.
Encryption is a personal and professional interest to me, and I have a history of small-scale encryption projects. The most important thing I've learned here is to be careful and avoid experimentation in the implementation.
I will also use Encrypted Notepad 2 daily.

So give me a shout and if you want a better, more convenient encrypted notepad for yourself and the society at large, think about backing this project!

Timeline and deliverables


This crowdfunding campaign lasts 2 months (60 days), which means I will start working on the project by Summer 2015. You should expect the first usable version of Encrypted Notepad 2 soon after, and at most by Fall.


Long story short, you and the world will get a simple text editor (think ""Notepad"") which saves to the PGP native "".asc"" encrypted file format, with symmetric encryption.



This new version is to have all the features from this document, plus whatever is suggested by the users with contributor perks and whatever other features become convenient during the initial development. 


The features will be implemented as a desktop (Java, Cross-platform) application and as an Android mobile device application.
Stretch-goals, if reached, will include making an iOS application.

This is an all-or-nothing campaign because I believe the idea it presents deserves to get full attention to details, without half-assing it, without cutting corners.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

As such, we've developed AmbiLock™ to remain engaged during a loss of power, and for the batteries to be swapped out with ordinary, easy-to-find batteries.  No need to replace obscure batteries or use confusing “jump start” methods with AmbiLock™.

But if you lose a key or forget a password, the person kept out is the one person who needs to get in.  AmbiLock™ is the secure lock that doesn't rely on either. Form and Function: meet your new lock./// ABOUT Ambi.ioAmbi is a collaboration from a bunch of curious, jovial, semi crazy tech folk living all around the Bay Area. Members of Ambi have consulted for or are/been employed with with various companies including: Hitachi, G-Technology, Boxbee.com, Handle.com, Teamblueotter.com, Fabrik, Roxio, Glam Media, Stanford Learning, SinoSol, Clever Solar, WestEd, Matchframe, Reach Media, Sportgenic, Sonic Solutions, Business Objects, etc... so yeah, we have some experience. OG Spock, you will be missed./// WTF is the AmbiLock™Well, its the next generation of the classic lock, of course. Your keychain's already bulky enough (i'm looking at you Mr. huge bottle opener keychain guy), and there are already enough passwords swirling around your noggin. AmbiLock™ doesn't rely on either of those archaic methods. Instead, all you need is either your mobile phone OR a customizable swipe combination, and it's unlocked and ready to go. For iPhone 5s and newer users, unlocking is at your fingertips (literally, using Touch ID*). It's tough to lose that...unless you have, in which case much love and empathy. So, ditch the keys/memory and lower your stress level with AmbiLock™.*Fingerprint is used to open the AmbiLock™ iOS mobile application./// HOW IT WORKSUnlike locks with a single method for entry, AmbiLock™ comes with an array of features. What you can do with it:
Program your own personal swipe pattern on the Ambi touchscreen. (think Android phone lock screens)
Use BlueTooth to unlock Ambi with your phone.  (it links to your phone and uses iBeacon/Low power Bluetooth technology to open the lock when you're nearby nearby)
Unlock the AmbiLock™ app using your fingerprint (for iPhone 5s+ users).
Share the lock's electronic permissions with others. This option can be set for one-time or constant use.
  /// BATTERY LIFE - WE GOT THIS COVEREDAmbiLock™ solves the big problem that other electronic locks on the market have: Battery power. It is powered with beefy coined sized batteries. However, we know locks can stay put for months, maybe even years, before they're called into action. And all that time, the battery's slowly draining. As such, we've developed AmbiLock™ to remain engaged during a loss of power, and for the batteries to be swapped out with ordinary, easy-to-find batteries.  No need to replace obscure batteries or use confusing “jump start” methods with AmbiLock™. Just take out the slot on the bottom of the AmbiLock™, pop out the battery, put a new one in and you're back in business.We are shooting for one year of battery life with active use and 5 years with minimal use./// MOBILE APP: iOS and Androidary support // COMPATIBILITY - iOS 8, Android flavor Lollipop// UNLOCK HISTORY - The AmbiLock™ creates a history* that allows users to track who's used the lock and when they've used it.  This is Perfect for the office or home!*History data is kept on the firmware.// FINGERPRINT ACCESS - Remember those old sci-fi movies that showed space pirates locking and unlocking doors using only their fingerprints? Well, that technology's finally here. For users with iOS that supports Touch ID, AmbiLock™ allows them to open the iOS app pressing their fingerprint on the touchscreen. Yes you already have your phone locked but isn't extra security always better? (especially if your kid is trying to get into your fun box)// PAIRING - You can pair up to 100 Ambi's with one mobile device.// SECURITY - We realize that the above all else the bells and whistles don't matter if the physical lock doesn't work. So, for AmbiLock™, we utilized a superman level steel skeleton, with an anodized aluminum skin. This allows us to provide tough as nails construction while freeing the outside skin to achieve more design possibilities. Locks can be pretty too. We developed the AmbiLock™ with best practices encryption software, to make sure hacking is kept at bay. When the AmbiLock™ is engaged, it will provide the same amount of security as other top locks in the market. // WEATHER RESISTANT - Though you can’t throw it in the pool, we have designed the lock to weather...well, the weather.// DIG THE COLORS - Show off your own personal style with a tonne of different color options: Red, white, blue, black, gold, yellow, orange, purple and silver. (You will receive an email to select the color shortly before we ship)  We want to thank everyone in advance for their support! /// Shipping Costs  - We estimate customers in the USA will need to pay ~(usd) $7 - $10 per order.  - International customers will be on a country specific basis. We estimate ~ (usd)        $15-$20 per order.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

As you can see the above image shows the accented version.Our aim is to develop an algorithm and code which would take the unaccented word (पुरोहितं) as input and give accented word (पु॒रोहि॑तं)as output.Impact This would be the first of its kind effort in Sanskrit Natural Language Processing.At the end of the project, we would be able to 
  Create a tool which can give accented version of unaccented words.
 Create accented dictionaries out of unaccented database



Future implications
  Though not included in scope of the present work, Sanskrit Text-To-Speech (TTS) convertors can also benifit from the output of this code, because the machine would know that it has to pronounce grave / acute accent properly.
The framework can be extended for other languages.

   
Project Time and Budget

Analysis of Sanskrit grammar texts - 300 hoursPreparation of algorithm - 200 hoursPreparation of code - 200 hoursTesting of code - 150 hoursDocumentation of code - 150 hoursTotal duration - 1000 man hours.Per hour cost - 10 USDTotal project cost - 10,000 USD.The Team
1. Dr. Dhaval Patel - Analysis of grammar texts, preparation of algorithm and code2. Dr. Shivakumari Katuri - Testing and Documentation of the software.Our previous efforts
We have already collaborated on two similar projects earlier.1. Sanskrit noun form generator - https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSubanta/2. Sanskrit Verb form generator - https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/Both of these projects are complete and their outcome is free for all.Open source

This is the key word in whatever we do.The code is free for all, whether the use is commercial or non-profit.Your contribution would keep us doing service of Sanskrit.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Still more studies show a correlation between eg. cancer and allergy and the content of chemicals and pesticides. By buying organic food you do not only protect yourself and your children, you also protect streams, groundwater and the natural vegetation and wildlife.</p><p>Animal welfare is also important in organic farming.

Unfortunately, the consumers do not have access to those products via ordinary supermarkets, since the production of each local farmer is usually too small to be of interest to a chain of supermarkets. Instead, small specialty stores or farm shops are selling the products, thus making them unavailable to the majority of Danes.</p><p>Leaf will make it possible for local organic farmers to sell their own products in their local Leaf supermarket.

</h3><h3>Employment in Leaf</h3><div>
<p>Leaf considers all humans as valuable individuals with resources from which the business and society can benefit. Leaf will primarily hire persons who have difficulties entering the labor market as well as resourceful managers and employees, serving as role models and good colleagues.</p>
<p>All employees in Leaf, no matter rank, are also co-owners. Co-ownership gives a sense of responsibility and personal success and it is more fun and fulfilling to work for oneself than for a big company!</p>
<p>All employees in Leaf will become shareholders after three months of employment, with one stock each. Nobody will own more than one stock. Stocks cannot be sold, and if an employee chooses to leave Leaf, his or her stock will be given to the successor.</p>
<p>Employees are paid in accordance with collective and other arrangements and also get a quarterly bonus of 15 % of the profit, divided equally according to number of working hours.</p>
<p>Weekly a staff meeting will be arranged for all employees. The meeting consists of two parts: presentation and follow up by the management, and input and ideas by the staff. This gives all employees an actual have a say. All employees have equal opportunities to be promoted according to their skills, and continuing education will be offered.</p>
<h3>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</h3>
<p>Leaf has a CSR policy and wishes to have a positive impact on the environment and society.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b></p>
<p>Leaf sells organic products at favorable prices and thus the share of people buying organic food will expectedly increase, leading to a larger production of organic products and less use of chemicals and pesticides, that ultimately end up in the environment.</p>
<p>Leaf will minimize the use of wrapping and use sustainable wrapping as glass and paper. Plastic bags will not be found in Leaf supermarkets.</p>
<p>Leaf does not accept food waste, thus we are making great efforts to adapt the assortment to the consumers. We also have a short delivery time from our suppliers. In addition we have a range of initiatives in the supermarkets; freshly squeezed juice, café and a sandwich bar, all of which can use the supermarket's surplus food. Finally we will offer surplus food to vulnerable families and homeless people through the two humanitarian organisations the Mother's Aid.</p>
<p>It is our vision to build future Leaf supermarkets that are self-sufficient with rainwater and solar power.</p>
<p><b>Society</b></p>
<p>Leaf believes that people want to take an active part in society, to get a work and be part of a community, as far as they are able to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people are challenged by physical, psychological or social issues. These people often have great difficulties finding a job. A challenge also met by persons with a criminal record or a difficult youth.</p>
<p>Leaf wants to give everybody a chance to (re-)enter the labor market, according to their individual skills and capabilities! A chance to get a new and better life, where they feel useful and appreciated.</p>
<p><i>Example 1</i></p>
<p><i>John is 19 years old and has lived in a group home his entire life. He is dyslexic and has two verdicts for violence. By getting the right support, guidance and education in a Leaf supermarket, John can maybe become a butcher after five years of employment. At least he should have the chance.</i></p>
<p><i>Example 2</i></p>
<p><i>Marian is 54 years old and educated as an accountant. She has been off work sick for several years due to psychological illness. She is anxious and cannot handle many people at a time. She also cannot manage a job as accountant. In Leaf she can find a job in the storeroom, where her many years of work experience can contribute to more overview and efficiency. She feels comfortable with her few known colleagues, and never leaves the storeroom. She feels appreciated and as part of the community, despite only being able to work 12 hours pr. week.</i></p>

Økologiske leverandører fra hele Europa har givet os yderst fordelagtige vilkår og venter bare på, at de kan komme og fylde hylderne i det første Leaf supermarked!
Støt, del og hjælp os med at gøre Danmark dejligere og grønnere!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mød 
Forestil dig et supermarked, hvor fokus alene er på din sundhed, den gode smag og omsorg for miljøet. Hvor alle varer er både økologiske og billigere end i de almindelige supermarkeder. Et supermarked, hvor alle anses for værdifulde, og hvor der tages udgangspunkt i medarbejdernes individuelle ressourcer. Det er Leaf! Leaf er et økologisk forretningskoncept med tanke på vores børns fremtid og jorden som helhed. Ikke alene er Leaf 100 % økologisk som forretning, men vil også støtte fremtidige, miljøvenlige initiativer.Leaf er en socialøkonomisk virksomhed, hvor de ansatte også er medejere. Medejerskab giver større ansvarsfølelse, personlig succes og større arbejdsglæde. Leaf vil blive en kærkommen indgang til arbejdsmarkedet for personer med fysiske, psykiske og sociale udfordringer - hvor ressourcestærke ledere og ansatte vil fungere som rollemodeller, guider og gode kolleger.Din donation er derfor ikke alene en investering i Leaf, men også i en bedre verden!Når vi har nået vores mål, åbner den første butik indenfor en måned!                                              Økologiske fødevarer i DanmarkI Danmark er udvalget af økologiske fødevarer i traditionelle supermarkeder stadig meget begrænset og meget dyrt. Igen i 2015 opgjorde EU Kommisionen Danmark til at være det dyreste land at være forbruger i med et prisindeks på 145 % for fødevarer. Hvis man ser isoleret på økologiske fødevarer når prisindekset en svimlende højde på mere end 230 %! Økologisk mad er altså langt dyrere end uøkologisk mad og er dermed ikke en reel mulighed for trængte familier.  I vores sydlige nabolande har forbrugerne reel valgfrihed, når det kommer til økologiske fødevarer. Prisforskellene på uøkologiske og økologiske fødevarer er marginale, udvalget er ubeskriveligt større, og antallet af repræsenterede producenter er enormt.Leaf ønsker at give danske forbrugere et frit valg!         KonceptForretningsplanVi vil placere et lokalforankret økologisk fødevaremarked i alle danske byer med flere end 20.000 indbyggere. Udvalget vil være på ca. 20.000 varer. I byer med 5.000 indbyggere og op vil vi placere et økologisk supermarked med et vareudvalg på 600-800 produkter. Målet er 20 fødevaremarkeder og 120 supermarkeder i Danmark. For at sikre at økologiske fødevarer bliver let tilgængelige for alle, åbner vi også en webshop. Udvalget i fødevaremarkederne vil inkludere:
Frugt og grøntsager
Slagter og pålægsafdeling
Kolonialvarer
Mælkeprodukter
Et bredt dansk, lokalproduceret sortiment i samarbejde med områdets økologiske producenter
Øl, vin og spiritus
Ifht. prisen vil Leaf være 40-60 % billigere end andre danske supermarkeder og på denne måde sikre, at alle har råd til at føre en sund, økologisk livsstil.Leverandører, lokaler og ansatteI Danmark har vi næsten 3.000 lokale, økologiske landmænd, og i Europa har vi adgang til tusindvis af økologisk varer af høj kvalitet. Vi har allerede lavet aftaler med all nødvendige leverandører, og de er klar til at levere deres produkter til Leaf.Vi har også fundet lokalerne i 3 danske byer og indgået aftaler med ejerne.Endelig har vi massevis af mennesker, der gerne vil arbejde i Leaf!Socialt ansvarlig virksomhed (CSR)Leaf har en CSR politik, der går ud på at have en positiv indvirkning på miljøet og mennesker, inklusiv forbrugere, ansatte og lokalsamfundene. Intet madspild I Leaf vil vi ikke acceptere madspild. Derfor har vi gjort meget ud af at tilpasse udvalget til danske forbrugere. Samtidig har vi en kort leveringstid fra leverandørerne, der gør, at udvalget hurtigt kan suppleres.Vi har derudover en række tiltag i butikkerne; som friskpresset grøntsagsjuice, cafémiljø og sandwichbar, der alle sammen kan udnytte butikkernes overskudsvarer, før de bliver dårlige.Endelig er der to organisationer, som ligger tæt op af vores filosofi om social ansvarlighed: Mødrehjælpen. Begge organisationer vil blive tilbudt overskudsmad til særligt udsatte personer.En ny indkøbsoplevelseLeaf er en helt ny indkøbsoplevelse! Ved at udnytte den nyeste teknologi kan vi omgå mange af de traditionelt fordyrende led og samtidig gøre det hurtigere og nemmere at handle ind.Kasserne er af hensyn til medarbejderne ren selvbetjening. Men det klares nemt, da varerne allerede registreres, når du placerer dem i indkøbskurven.En stor del af varerne er emballagefri for at skåne miljøet, ligesom du heller ikke finder plastikposer i Leaf.              Leaf - udenfor Danmarks grænser Når Leaf er blevet godt etableret i Danmark, ønsker vi at udvide vores koncept ud over Danmarks grænser til vores nabolande for at give deres forbrugere de samme økologiske muligheder. Vi vil ligeledes støtte økologiske initiativer over hele verden.                                                   Derfor crowdfunder viDet koster en del at starte en supermarkedskæde op fra bunden.Investorer og banker fokuserer alene på profit, hvorimod Leaf fokuserer på miljøet og social ansvarlighed. Leaf ønsker at tilgodese samfundet, det globale miljø og vores ansatte - ikke i forvejen velhavende investorer.Leaf vil dele 15 % af overskuddet mellem medarbejderne, og geninvestere 85 % i virksomheden; til at åbne nye butikker, uddanne medarbejdere, hjælpe lokale producenter med at omlægge til økologi og lave andre miljøvenlige tiltag.Derfor har vi brug for din donation, uanset om den er lille eller stor.Din donation er med til at plante et frø, der kan vokse sig stort og stærkt, og i læ af Leaf-butikkerne vil fremtidige økologiske initiativer kunne vokse op.Husk også at vise din støtte ved at dele vores hjemmeside og vores indiegogo side!                                          Hvordan bliver pengene brugt?Vores første mål er at åbne et supermarked og lancere vores webshop, så økologiske fødevarer bliver tilgængelige for alle, uanset hvor i Danmark de bor.Afhængigt af hvor mange penge vi får rejst, vil midlerne blive brugt som følger:
175,000 $      1 supermarked og en webshop
300,000 $    2 supermarkeder og en webshop
500,000 $     1 fødevaremarked, 2 supermarkeder og en webshop
+100,000 $   Hver 100.000 $ ekstra giver et ekstra supermarked
Hvis vi, mod forventning, ikke når vores mål på 175.000 $, vil vi bruge dit bidrag til at åbne en lille butik og en webshop. Overskuddet fra disse butikker vil efterfølgende blive brugt til at åbne yderligere butikker. Frynsegoder (Perks)Vi er taknemmelige for hver eneste donation, vi modtager! For at mindes vores grundlæggere, vil vi udødeliggøre deres navne på Grundlæggernes Væg (Founder's Wall). En sådan væg vil blive placeret i alle Leaf supermarkeder samt på vores hjemmeside.Når du laver en donation til Leaf, kan du vælge mellem adskillige lækre frynsegoder til dig selv. Du kan også vælge at donere dit frynsegode til de to humanitære organisationer: Mødrehjælpen (www.moedrehjaelpen.dk). Mødrehjælpen hjælper trængende familier med små børn og gravide kvinder.                                      Mere information Holdet bag Leaf    Sebastian S.

Imagine a supermarket in which focus is solely on your health, a good taste and concern for the environment. In which all products are organic and cheaper than found in ordinary supermarkets. In which everybody is seen as valuable, and focus is on individual resources. This is what Leaf is all about!Leaf is an ecofriendly business concerned about the environment and the future of our children and our planet. Leaf will not only be a 100 % organic organisation, it will also help backing future ecofriendly initiatives.Leaf is a social economic business where employees are also co-owners. Co-ownership gives a sense of responsibility and personal success. Leaf will be an entry point to the labor market for persons with physical, psychological and social challenges – where resourceful managers and employees will serve as role models, guides and good colleagues.Your donation will thus not only be an investment in Leaf, but also an investment in a better world!When reaching our funding goal, the first shop will open within a month!                                            Organic food in DenmarkIn Denmark the assortment of organic food in traditional supermarkets is still very limited and very expensive. The European price index of consumer prices (2015) shows that Denmark is by far the most expensive country with an index of 145 %. Seen in isolation, organic food hits an amazing index of more than 230 %! Thus organic food is much more expensive than non-organic food, making it unavailable to families with less means.In neighboring countries, consumers have an actual choice of freedom when it comes to organic versus non-organic food. The price difference is insignificant, the assortment is much larger and the number of manufacturers is huge.Leaf wishes to give Danish consumers a free choice!            ConceptBusiness planWe wish to build an organic food fair in every Danish city with a population of more than 20,000. The assortment will be of approximately 2.000 products. In cities with a population of more than 5,000, we will build organic supermarkets with an assortment of approximately 600-800 products. Our goal is to open 20 food fairs and 120 supermarkets in Denmark. To ensure that organic food is made readily available to everybody, we will also open a webshop. The assortment of the food fair will include:
Fruit and vegetables
Butcher and cold cuts department
Processed food
Diary products
A wide assortment of locally produced products in cooperation with local, organic farmers
Beer, wine and liquour
With regard to price, Leaf will be approximately 40-60 % cheaper than other Danish supermarkets, thus ensuring that everybody will have the means to lead a healthy, organic lifestyle.Suppliers, facilities and employeesIn Denmark, we have almost 3,000 local, organic farmers, and in Europe we have access to thousands of organic, high quality products. We have already made agreements with all necessary suppliers, and they are ready to deliver their products to Leaf.We have also found the facilities in 3 Danish cities and made agreements with the owners.Finally, we have a lot of people just waiting to get the opportunity to get a job in Leaf!Corporate social responsibility (CSR)Leaf has a CSR policy to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders, including consumers, employees and communities.No food wasteLeaf does not accept food waste, thus we are making great efforts to adapt the assortment to Danish consumers. We also have a short delivery time from our suppliers.In addition we have a range of initiatives in the supermarkets; freshly squeezed juice, café and a sandwich bar, all of which can use the supermarket's surplus food.Finally we will offer surplus food to vulnerable families and homeless people through the two humanitarian organisations the Mother's Aid.   A new shopping experienceLeaf is an all new shopping experience!By using the newest technology we are able to bypass the traditionally price-raising links and at the same time make it quicker and easier to shop.The check-out will be all self-service, which will be easily done since the products are already registered when placed in the shopping basket.A large number of the products are not wrapped in order to protect the environment, and plastic bags are not found in Leaf.                     Leaf - beyond DenmarkWhen Leaf has become well established in Denmark, we wish to expand our concept beyond the borders of Denmark to our neighbouring countries to bring the same organic possibilities to their consumers. We will also support organic initiatives worldwide.                                                     Why do we need your support?It costs a lot to start a new chain of supermarkets from scratch.Investors and the banking system only focus on profit, whereas Leaf focuses on the environment and social responsibility. Leaf wishes to benefit the community, the environment and the employees, not already wealthy investors.Leaf will share 15 % of the profit between the employees, and reinvest 85 % of the profit in the business for opening new supermarkets, education of employees, helping local farmers and manufacturers convert into organic production etc.Therefore we need your contribution, whether small or large.Your donation will help plant a seed, which can grow huge and strong, and under the protection of the Leaf supermarkets, future ecofriendly initiatives will be able to grow.Remember to also show your support by sharing our website or our Indiegogo page!                                          How is your funding used?Our first goal is to open one supermarket and launch our web-shop to make organic food available for everybody no matter where they live.Depending on how much money we raise, the money will be spent as follow:

To commemorate our founders we will immortalize their names on the Founder's Wall. A Founder's Wall will be placed in all Leaf supermarkets as well as on our website.When making af donation for Leaf, you can choose among several nice perks for yourself. You can also choose to donate your perk to the two humanitarian organisations: the Mother's Aid (Mødrehjælpen: www.moedrehjaelpen.dk). The Mother's Aid supports needy families with young children and pregnant women.                                                               More informationThe Leaf Team  Sebastian S. HansenChef and Entrepreneur“I work with Leaf for the sake of my children and future generations to come. I have never understood why food should be contaminated with chemicals or pumped with water? Leaf will be a warrantor of healthy and pure food”.Eva NølkeBiologist, Cand.scient""I am an enthusiastic environmentalist, dreaming of a healthier and safer world for my daughter to live in. I also wish for an easier access to the job market for vulnerable people. Therefore, I find that Leaf is a great and visionary project"".Mads K. B. ThomsenBusiness Administration Economist“I am dedicated to organic living and a more including and tolerant labor market. In Leaf we have developed a concept, combining these two things”Why choose organic?Organic food is healthier and taste better. In organic agriculture animals and plants get enough time to grow in a natural life cycle. They are not filled with growth hormones or force-fed. The slow growth gives af better taste.Organic food is free of pesticides. Pesticides accumulate in plants, animals and humans. Still more studies show a correlation between eg. cancer and allergy and the content of chemicals and pesticides. By buying organic food you do not only protect yourself and your children, you also protect streams, groundwater and the natural vegetation and wildlife.Animal welfare is also important in organic farming. Organic farm animals have space to move around. They are fed organic feed and have acces to outdoor areas. Local producersIn Denmark we have more than 2,600 organic farmers able to deliver af wide variety of organic products from peas, apples and plums to potatoes, wheat and carrots. Unfortunately, the consumers do not have access to those products via ordinary supermarkets, since the production of each local farmer is usually too small to be of interest to a chain of supermarkets. Instead, small specialty stores or farm shops are selling the products, thus making them unavailable to the majority of Danes.Leaf will make it possible for local organic farmers to sell their own products in their local Leaf supermarket. This way, the products will reach a greater audience and the local farmers will increase their profit.                       
Employment in Leaf
Leaf considers all humans as valuable individuals with resources from which the business and society can benefit. Leaf will primarily hire persons who have difficulties entering the labor market as well as resourceful managers and employees, serving as role models and good colleagues.
All employees in Leaf, no matter rank, are also co-owners. Co-ownership gives a sense of responsibility and personal success and it is more fun and fulfilling to work for oneself than for a big company!
All employees in Leaf will become shareholders after three months of employment, with one stock each. Nobody will own more than one stock. Stocks cannot be sold, and if an employee chooses to leave Leaf, his or her stock will be given to the successor.
Employees are paid in accordance with collective and other arrangements and also get a quarterly bonus of 15 % of the profit, divided equally according to number of working hours.
Weekly a staff meeting will be arranged for all employees. The meeting consists of two parts: presentation and follow up by the management, and input and ideas by the staff. This gives all employees an actual have a say. All employees have equal opportunities to be promoted according to their skills, and continuing education will be offered.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Leaf has a CSR policy and wishes to have a positive impact on the environment and society.
Environment
Leaf sells organic products at favorable prices and thus the share of people buying organic food will expectedly increase, leading to a larger production of organic products and less use of chemicals and pesticides, that ultimately end up in the environment.
Leaf will minimize the use of wrapping and use sustainable wrapping as glass and paper. Plastic bags will not be found in Leaf supermarkets.
Leaf does not accept food waste, thus we are making great efforts to adapt the assortment to the consumers. We also have a short delivery time from our suppliers. In addition we have a range of initiatives in the supermarkets; freshly squeezed juice, café and a sandwich bar, all of which can use the supermarket's surplus food. Finally we will offer surplus food to vulnerable families and homeless people through the two humanitarian organisations the Mother's Aid.
It is our vision to build future Leaf supermarkets that are self-sufficient with rainwater and solar power.
Society
Leaf believes that people want to take an active part in society, to get a work and be part of a community, as far as they are able to.
Unfortunately, a lot of people are challenged by physical, psychological or social issues. These people often have great difficulties finding a job. A challenge also met by persons with a criminal record or a difficult youth.
Leaf wants to give everybody a chance to (re-)enter the labor market, according to their individual skills and capabilities! A chance to get a new and better life, where they feel useful and appreciated.
Example 1
John is 19 years old and has lived in a group home his entire life. He is dyslexic and has two verdicts for violence. By getting the right support, guidance and education in a Leaf supermarket, John can maybe become a butcher after five years of employment. At least he should have the chance.
Example 2
Marian is 54 years old and educated as an accountant. She has been off work sick for several years due to psychological illness. She is anxious and cannot handle many people at a time. She also cannot manage a job as accountant. In Leaf she can find a job in the storeroom, where her many years of work experience can contribute to more overview and efficiency. She feels comfortable with her few known colleagues, and never leaves the storeroom. She feels appreciated and as part of the community, despite only being able to work 12 hours pr. week.",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We had a meeting about using Crowdfunding and there were those who wanted to employ fancy videos, high quality graphics and hire a writer to make this ""story"" compelling to the point that you open your wallet. I have something better. Look in the mirror, imagine every time you come home from work your children are asleep, every time. Or when you get your paycheck, it goes directly to rent since there was an increase this year. As a American, you were promised something and this promise did not include missing your children growing up or living to work. It was not a promise of not having enough but that's the reality for 63% of New Yorkers and 49% of the US that is currently under poverty. We choose to correct this and with your help we get at least 5 families a chance to breathe again knowing that they do have enough now.</p>
<h3>Who we are?</h3>
<p>We are the Startup company ""West New York Properties"".  Consisting of individuals that want to bring real change to the world that we live in, starting in New York State. The purpose of this campaign is not for us though, it's for the 63% of families here that are below poverty and can barely afford where they are currently living. Our Government programs are becoming scarce and the larger corporations are only looking at the bottom line. Instead of standing on a soapbox or posting it to social media, we have decided to get our hands dirty and do something about it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help, no we don't need any fancy equipment or a stylish new office, we need your financial assistance to help us acquire these distressed properties throughout NYS and fixing them into affordable housing for low income families.  Crowdfunding allows us to stay true to the goal rather than a loan that will force us to focus on the payback. </p>
<ul>
<li>There are several distressed properties ranging between $5-$10K, including closing costs, with renovations costing round $14-$20k.</li>
<li>When the property is purchased we invite you to come check it out if you are in the area but we will gladly send a thank you letter and photo from us and the families that you helped.</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, the project will still happen, it will just take longer to get started and there is no promise that these properties will still exist for purchase with all of the Urban Revitalization Programs happening throughout the year.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping us with this project, you also help the internal and surrounding communities by:</p>
<ul>
<li>We make the communities look better.</li>
<li>We return these distressed properties back to the county tax roll which leads to.</li>
<li>More families and small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these local Governments are able to strive on their own they won't need to look at option like property or local tax increases which tend to force families to move out or worst.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course we will face some challenges along the way like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affordability, some properties will be perfect but will require more capital than we have to fix up.</li>
<li>There are bigger companies with more friends who will also be looking to acquire these properties for different purposes.</li>
<li>Solution: We move to partner with these firms in hope of at least  50% being devoted to low income family housing.</li>

<p><strong>The Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>Over the past three years the Kruse family has added almost 500 American Flags to the patriotic display along Greenville's historic Park Street, Audie Murphy Overpass leading into Downtown Greenville, and a number of areas around town.  Many residents of Greenville already participate and have a flag placed in their front yard by the Greenville Daybreak Rotary. The Kruse's were inspired to go out on their own and acquire the flags after watching a CBS Sunday Morning episode that featured Larry Eckhardt aka “The Flagman” and his efforts to honor America’s fallen heroes.  In the past couple years, the flags have been used to line a portion of the funeral procession of the late Navy Seal, Chris Kyle, as well as other events around the area.</p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>This year the Kruse family is working to extend the flag lined streets that have already lined the section of Business Highway 69 from Park Street to Downtown Greenville.  This largest goal to date is to line I-30 with from Monty Stratton Parkway to Moulton Street.  This effort will take over a thousand flags and hundreds of hours of work.  </p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We are once again asking for contributions to help with the supplies needed.  With such a large goal this year we are seeking as much help from the community as possible.  You can make a contribution via this campaign of visit our Facebook page for more info on how you can help. (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GreenvilleFlags"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/GreenvilleFlags</a>)</p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So this idea has been toying around in my head (Tom's) for </span><b>nearly a decade!</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">  But after many other priorities over the past 5-10 years of several business ventures, non-profit work, and the biggest priority of family - I’m excited to finally get it off the ground with the help of a key business partner. (Dave) <br/><i>[More about us down below]</i></span></p>
<p><b>Nowadays we see the tipping point of the on-demand economy</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> - whether that’s the mainstream stuff like Airbnb and Uber now, or the up-and-coming, innovative ideas like fuel delivery / on-demand, different models of delivery via Amazon, or food delivery services - both prepared and grocery-level services. And so much more...</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">With that all said, we are truly honored and excited to introduce to you, Shamme!  </span></p>
<p><b></b></p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>You’re looking to get your car cleaned, and you haven’t had time to do this yourself, and either the nearest car wash is busy, not working, or too far away. Adding to this issue, car wash stations charge a small fortune for a mediocre job and can waste gallons of precious water, while possibly damaging your car in the process. </p>
<p>OR, you wait in a long line at an over-priced auto-detailer - wasting your time AND money!</p>

<h3>So we created a simple fix for this...<b><i>introducing Shamme!</i></b>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>Just like ‘shammy’ (chamois) - the rag, Shamme contracts expert car detailers out on the road all day, every day, cleaning cars around the city. As the world’s <b>first online scheduling application for car washes</b>, we’ll clean your car when you’re not there. <b>We can come to your office, your home, recreational activity site, the airport your car is parked at, your hotel, park ‘n’ ride space or the sporting event parking lot where you’re enjoying the game or concert.</b> You just book your order for a wash, or wash &amp; wax and leave the rest to us.</p>
<p>By the time you return, your car exterior is sparkling and you’re good to go!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>How Shamme Works</h2>
<p>Simply schedule your car wash on our mobile friendly website or with our smartphone app (launching fall/winter 2016) within a few minutes, inform us where your car is located and the timeframe in which you’d like us to clean your vehicle. Our Shamme detailers will scrub and expertly clean the exterior of your car/van/pickup, whatever, to a shine - and when you return, it’ll be looking like new. We don’t even need your car keys since Shamme cleans your exterior yet if your car is VIP or valet parked, you can also book interior detailing. Once the job is completed, automatic payment is processed. Hey, you can even leave a tip on Shamme for your detailers as a thank you.</p>
<p><b>Not only are we more environmentally-friendly</b>, using only around <b>15</b> to <b>20</b> gallons of water per vehicle, as opposed to typical car washes that waste 65 to 100 gallons - AND we’re flexible on location and timeframe windows. <b>The ""time and location"" factor is our secret sauce</b>, to doing what NO ONE else is doing out there.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465961977/shamme-howitworks1_xg0h4z.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Shamme Results</h2>
<p>With Shamme, you gain a flurry of benefits from booking our service for an impulse, occasional or weekly clean. </p>
<p>Imagine the possibilities of no more embarrassing situations when you’re heading to a meeting and your boss decides to join, but your car is dirty. </p>
<p>Or leaving your muddy car at the airport and returning to a clean vehicle. <b>Airports are bound to be our biggest seller!</b>  <i>Have you ever driven by these <b>HUGE</b> lots in airports and seen all the cars, just <b>sitting there for DAYS</b>??!</i></p>
<p>How about that rainy morning at your kid’s soccer game yet you’re picking up the in-laws for lunch and you haven’t a moment to clean up your car while you’re watching the match. Goal!</p>
<p>Possibly you’re a regular commuter who parks ‘n’ rides and would love to return to a sparkling car come Friday. Or your car is at the mechanic and when it’s ready for pick up, it’s also Shamme clean!</p>
<p>Maybe you list your car as a peer-to-peer vehicle and a neighbor wants to rent it, but you’re not nearby so the renter could write a negative review about its cleanliness. If you’ve hired a vehicle from a rental agency, they charge surplus cleaning fees so now you can avoid additional overinflated detailing costs. After a relaxing trip to the spa, you don’t want to chip your nails and ruin your hair because your car needs cleaning. While you’re in the salon, so is your car...right outside, being scrubbed to a shine.</p>
<p>Also consider how much gas and time you’ll save from not needing to drive to a car wash, because we come to where your car is parked.</p>

<h2>Geographical Launch</h2>

So this idea has been toying around in my head (Tom's) for nearly a decade!  But after many other priorities over the past 5-10 years of several business ventures, non-profit work, and the biggest priority of family - I’m excited to finally get it off the ground with the help of a key business partner. (Dave) [More about us down below]
Nowadays we see the tipping point of the on-demand economy - whether that’s the mainstream stuff like Airbnb and Uber now, or the up-and-coming, innovative ideas like fuel delivery / on-demand, different models of delivery via Amazon, or food delivery services - both prepared and grocery-level services. And so much more...
With that all said, we are truly honored and excited to introduce to you, Shamme!  


Think Uber crossed with mobile detailing, with a splash of online scheduling thrown in.  We are in the pilot / beta stages, but have already built out the initial site framework and done years of research - and so we’re eager to launch the website this summer, and start piloting out our area around the Washington D.C. / Baltimore / Annapolis areas, as well as consider the next areas that we’ll target.  From there, we plan to get the mobile app up and running by the fall - which will make scheduling even easier! (keeping in mind though, the summer version of the website will still be very responsive and easy-to-use on mobile devices, smartphones, tablets, etc. - so no worries there.  It will almost feel like an app, in fact)
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP! :)
So you’re probably asking - what are we all about?!  Here’s the lowdown how you can get in on our early development stages, and be a KEY part of our growth and adoption throughout the country!


The Problem
You’re looking to get your car cleaned, and you haven’t had time to do this yourself, and either the nearest car wash is busy, not working, or too far away. Adding to this issue, car wash stations charge a small fortune for a mediocre job and can waste gallons of precious water, while possibly damaging your car in the process. 
OR, you wait in a long line at an over-priced auto-detailer - wasting your time AND money!




So we created a simple fix for this...introducing Shamme!


Our Solution
Just like ‘shammy’ (chamois) - the rag, Shamme contracts expert car detailers out on the road all day, every day, cleaning cars around the city. As the world’s first online scheduling application for car washes, we’ll clean your car when you’re not there. We can come to your office, your home, recreational activity site, the airport your car is parked at, your hotel, park ‘n’ ride space or the sporting event parking lot where you’re enjoying the game or concert. You just book your order for a wash, or wash & wax and leave the rest to us.
By the time you return, your car exterior is sparkling and you’re good to go!

How Shamme Works
Simply schedule your car wash on our mobile friendly website or with our smartphone app (launching fall/winter 2016) within a few minutes, inform us where your car is located and the timeframe in which you’d like us to clean your vehicle. Our Shamme detailers will scrub and expertly clean the exterior of your car/van/pickup, whatever, to a shine - and when you return, it’ll be looking like new. We don’t even need your car keys since Shamme cleans your exterior yet if your car is VIP or valet parked, you can also book interior detailing. Once the job is completed, automatic payment is processed. Hey, you can even leave a tip on Shamme for your detailers as a thank you.
Not only are we more environmentally-friendly, using only around 15 to 20 gallons of water per vehicle, as opposed to typical car washes that waste 65 to 100 gallons - AND we’re flexible on location and timeframe windows. The ""time and location"" factor is our secret sauce, to doing what NO ONE else is doing out there.





Shamme Results
With Shamme, you gain a flurry of benefits from booking our service for an impulse, occasional or weekly clean. 
Imagine the possibilities of no more embarrassing situations when you’re heading to a meeting and your boss decides to join, but your car is dirty. 
Or leaving your muddy car at the airport and returning to a clean vehicle. Airports are bound to be our biggest seller!  Have you ever driven by these HUGE lots in airports and seen all the cars, just sitting there for DAYS??!

<p>Border City Cakes is currently a home-based operation. For the past 6 years it has been steadily growing in popularity, and has gained a very loyal clientele. With only word of mouth used for advertising, Border City Cakes has become a city-wide brand name with nearly 4,000 fans on Facebook. I'm regularly booked solid nearly a month in advance, and known locally for being the best place to go for extraordinarily delicious and stunning cake and cupcakes. I believe my success is because <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Border City Cakes has, and will always be, about the incompromisable integrity of the product being presented to clients.</span></p>
<p>After 6 years of dedicated brand-building and hard work, Border City Cakes has become a family business, capable of more than adequetely solely supporting a household. I'm positive that given the opportunity to expand to a commercial location, Border City Cakes would sky rocket to become THE place to get cakes and cupcakes in Windsor Essex County. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need. Brass Tacks Time.</h3> <p>The unfortunate part of transitioning a home-based business to even a small scale commercial bakery, is that it's extremely expensive because the set up is very specific due to building codes, fire safety, and the need to invest in commercial size equipment. The bulk of expenses are the large pricey items such as a walk-in cooler, a refrigerated display case, large Hobart mixers, hood ventilation, commercial oven, a dishwashing station, commercial size fridges and freezers. These items needed to start up add up VERY quickly.</p>
<p>Also, because of the specific set up needed, the chances of finding a space for lease that is bakery-ready and in good condition are slim to none. Whatever space is found, needs to have renovations that are rarely (if ever) included in lease conditions.  </p>
<p>So, that's what the $40,000 covers. I know it's a lot of money. So far this financial hump has been a hurdle I'm not able to tackle on my own, which is why I'm asking for some help in this way. A little bit or a lot, all contributions are very appreciated and helpful. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>If this campaign is successfully funded, here are some of the things you can look forward to seeing from Border City Cakes:</p>
<ul> <li>A truly exciting high end bake shop with a phenomenal established reputation</li>
<li>A full and innovative cupcake menu offered daily for drop-in visits </li>
<li>Fun promotions and events unlike any other in the city. Border City Cakes is home of the wildly successful Mystery Wedding Cake Promotion and Facebook Cupcake Auctions</li> <li>Cake and cupcake classes for adults and children, as well as skill demonstrations</li>

I had fun performing all these jobs titles and learned a lot from them. But my true passion is cleaning and arranging I love keeping houses and cars and yard clean and tidy. I love the Joy I  bring to people once I clean and arrange their house .the smile in their faces is all i need. I have decided to create this small company to make this dream and passion a reality. The money you provide will help with purchase of more cleaning supplies such as vacuum brooms ,mops ,windows squeegees ,rags and a used mini van.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Patsy Barnett, I am a Realtor and Real Estate Property Manager in the Philadelphia, PA area.  I was a single mother and raised my son who is now 36 years old.  I currently lease 3 properties to single mothers.  I have watched them struggle to make ends meet for many years now and I remember the struggle to provide a loving and safe home for my son.  Two of the single moms are in housing programs which subsidize their rental payment.  This is good and bad.  The help is good but the program does not help or prepare them to become homeowners.  One mother has been in the same property for almost 11 years.  She loves the neighborhood, it is close to her mother's house which is a convenience and she would like to stay in the property.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My goal is to help single parents become responsible
homeowners.  There are many hard working
individuals that are trying to raise children and provide a decent home but the
economy has made it hard to make ends meet. 
My program will provide homeownership within a year and teach the
recipient how to maintain and keep their new home.</p>
<p>One day I received a credit card statement in the mail and was billed a $.50 finance charge in error.  I called the company and they made an adjustment but I started thinking about how many people would just pay the charge because it was a nominal amount and how much the credit card company was making just from collecting a $.50 finance charge from many, many people.  </p>
<p>At that point I started thinking how I could raise funds to purchase the homes $1 at a time to allow the current tenant to become the homeowner.  And that's where I need your help.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> I need as many people as possible to donate a minimum of $1, of course we will accept more as you please.  The first house we need to collect $60,000, which is just 60,000 people donating $1 to help a single parent become a homeowner.  I want to help each potential homeowner understand the responsibility and up keep needed to maintain a home.   I want to help these single parents become independent of housing programs where applicable.  We will use the funds to purchase the property, renovate as needed and provide a teaching program for  the tenant/owner to help them prepare for the responsibilities of being a homeowner.  </div><div>My goal is to raise the full amount needed but if we do not reach the goal I will return the funds donated back to the individuals that were supportive of our effort to make single parents homeowners.   </div><div>We need the world to know that you have contributed to a wonderful cause that helps single parents become homeowners, therefore any contribution of $10 or more will receive a refrigerator magnet and $25 or more a car bumper magnet which  will identify the cause so that you can advertise our effort.</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The recipient would lease the property for a
period of one year and be responsible for the insurance, taxes, and maintenance
during this time.<span>  In addition, they

completion of the program the deed would be put in their name and they will become
homeowners.  </span></p>

</div></div>","It all starts with a Vrient
When you
graduate, you have many friends and NOTHING is going to change that.
Nothing? 
So you will
lose friends over the years, but it’s not as easy as it was during the college
days to find new friends who compliment your new lifestyle. You have a family
now and your friends will be your family’s friends. 
Sure, you
got social network sites, but those are to stay in touch with existing friends
or connect with old ones. 
Or you have
single dating sites, but those are only good for finding love, not new friends.

And all of
them give you individual profiles, so as a family you won’t find anybody. 


Why choose to become a Vrient?


Vrient is the new
friend site for couples with or without children, single parents, and even
singles who are fed up with dating sites and just want to meet people based on
interest, hobbies, travel or sports, without any hidden agenda. 
You just
make one profile where you can add your family as multiple users and indicate
what you love doing.
Vrient will
then propose profile matches based on our special algorithm. 


Are you a
family with 3 children and looking for another family to go on a skiing holiday
together? 
Are you a
single mom with 2 children and want to go to the zoo? 
It’s more
fun to meet with other people with children of the same age, don’t you think? 
Your
children just left home and you want to invite some couples without children
over for a barbecue and a few drinks?
Just send a
message, get in contact and get out to meet each other. 


Who is Vrient for?
The new friend platform is suited for: 
- Couples with or without children who are looking for another family to hang out with... 
- Single parents looking for someone their child can have play dates with...
- Singles who are fed up of social websites and want to meet someone new based on their interests...So all who just want to meet people based on location, interest, travel, hobbies or sports, without any hidden agenda. 




Once you're set up within minutes, you can simply login and start finding Vrients.

Log in and indicate which family member you are.
The HIVE will automatically suggest your new Vrients based on your location and interests.
Invite a profile to become Vrients,
Start chatting. The whole family can chat together. 
Meet in real life.

Have fun!




What makes Vrient unique? 

Dating for Families

What are the Vrient goals? 





Goal 1: 1.650 $ we build the website

</p><p>It was in Detroit, Michigan, at a session with
officials of the Arab American Chamber of Commerce in the United States of
America, last month that the nickel dropped about the need to start a social
innovation project back home in Nigeria that helps the small business owner and aspiring
entrepreneur wade through the difficulties of starting and sustaining his
business.</p>
<p>As I listened keenly to the middle age Yemeni
woman addressing us (I was part of a group of International visitors who were
guests of the United States Government) at the chamber, she began to talk about
the activities of Tejara, a Detroit based business incubator that was doing
much in helping the Arab community of the American Midwest to take over the
commanding heights of the Michigan economy after a slow recovery from the US
financial crises of 2008.</p>
<p>A few days later, this conviction about social
innovation was reinforced when I walked through the facilities of Tech Town,
Detroit’s main innovation hub and smart zone located close to Wayne University.
As the city’s most established business accelerator and incubator, I saw
firsthand how it was helping small tech startups succeed in Detroit’s push to
reinvent itself.</p>
<p>I began to think incubation and acceleration as
my vehicle for social change. I felt this form of innovation would be more of a
novel solution to the teething problem of unemployment in Nigeria, as it would
be more effective in creating value which would accrue directly to society as a
whole rather than just a few individuals.</p>
<p>My decision to head up the social innovation path
once I came back to Nigeria was finally cemented weeks later in New England,
Boston Massachusetts to be precise as I toured the facilities of GreenLabs, the
largest clean technology incubator in the United States operating a 30,000sq ft
facility that houses a community of bold, passionate entrepreneurs creating
life changing energy technologies that transform the way we live, work, and
play.</p>
<p>Now, up until that point, I never saw business
incubation as a vehicle for social change. I always looked upon incubation as
just another avenue for business development. Incubation and acceleration were
not totally new to me. Having worked at the Federal Ministry of Trade &amp;
Investment in Abuja as a Special Assistant to the Hon Minister, I have been
part of several teams that worked directly with the Small &amp; Medium
Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) in fashioning out policies
that grow small businesses and position them for success.</p>
<p>However, seeing incubators and accelerators in
full scale operation, from the American Midwest right up to New England,
churning out life changing technology, brought home their importance to me in a
way I never saw in Nigeria.</p>
<p>On my 14 hour flight back home from the Boston
Logan via Frankfurt a few days later, I reappraised the problem statement
again: many small business owners in Africa are struggling. They are smart,
have bold ideas and are very passionate about what they have chosen to do.</p>
<p>However, they lack support- they need to write
business plans or feasibility reports- they can’t. They need to access funds- a
few millions, some just a few hundred thousands, they are not able to. They
need office space to operate; they don’t know any address to even use for
postal purposes.</p>
<p>They need to be mentored, they need to be better
educated about management best practices, but they don’t even know that they
need this sort of education. This was my statement of the problem and Small
Business Activation (SBA) is my solution- my vehicle for social innovation.</p>I know it is now time for
social innovation in the business development space and my team and I have come
up with this project, Small Business Activation, a business incubator and start
up accelerator.<br/><br/><p>Yes, there are several business incubators in
Africa, but only few offer more than office space and/or wet labs. Just a
handful of them provide the necessary professional support team that is needed
to prop up these entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>At SBA, we provide all this and leverage our
global connections to provide entrepreneurial training and education, in
conjunction with nearby universities and training institutions. We provide in
house access to a diverse ecosystem of resource and service providers in a
collaborative environment.</p>So, SBA is building a community of passionate entrepreneurs to help nurture their small  businesses that would create employment and reduce poverty in Africa.The money raised will be used to set up an incubation centre and an acceleration program. <br/><br/>We will invite selected small business owners into the centre, give them small offices and/or wet labs (for them to conduct their businesses and/pr production operations), help them develop business plans, feasibility &amp; marketing reports. We will get a team of legal, financial &amp; IT experts to help them properly ground their operations while we will connect them to financing and funding sources.<br/><br/>Our acceleration program will mentor them, educate them, give them access to a network of angel investors and then make sure they access and are trained in technologies of their industries.<br/><br/>Basically, the idea is to give them tool of their own personal empowerment to help them succeed and then go out and create jobs that not only reduce poverty in Nigeria, but Africa as a whole.<br/><br/>So, Small Business Activation is also a poverty alleviation project of some sort and I hope those who believe in reducing poverty worldwide will key into this.<br/><br/><p></p><p>We hope to raise a new generation of super

<h3><b>Who Benefits?</b></h3>
<p><i>You.</i> 
Your heart will feel so warm and gooey, on top of the physical benefit 
of the reward you’ll be sent (digitally or through the mail!). You can 
even be one of the first people to sign up for a subscription box (one-time delivery or 4-time, quarterly delivery)!</p>
<p><i>Us. </i>We, those terrible, naval-gazing millennials get to do some good. </p>
<p>But most of all…</p>
<p><i>The youth. </i>They’ll have a sustainable way of getting what they need, and the encouragement to get through what is more than likely the hardest period of their lives.</p>
<p>Here are some quotes from the youth we've reached out to:</p>
<p><b>""Access to binders and non-binaried clothing to me means that I am loved 
and appreciated by my LGBT family all around the world. It makes me  
feel like I matter. If I suddenly had a way of getting them, to me it 
would mean that I could finally be me.""</b></p>
<p><b>""It means the absolute world to me. I need a binder as my chest dysphoria is severe but I cannot afford one at the moment. Access to this sort of material would be life changing for so many people, and so many would be extremely grateful for these things.""</b><br/></p>
<br/>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Our Income &amp; Cost Projections</b></h3>
<p>Our
 base cost is calculated through a goal of selling 200 total boxes so 
that we can build our presence, marketing, website (better), brand, 
internal systems, etc. </p>
<p>TOTAL: $15,400 broken down as:</p>
<p>$1100 for pride items for the boxes, as well as the boxes themselves and packing materials.</p>
<p>$2,800 for shipping for all the boxes (since they're buy-one-give-one, this figure it large!)</p>
<p>$500
 for toiletries and discrete bags (and both sponsors and youth will be 
able to pick their binary, or no binary on these items!)</p>
<p>$7,000 on
 clothing, binders, bras, stand-to-pees, books, and other miscellaneous 
requests (of which, we anticipate 32% going to binders alone) </p>
<p>$4,000
 for warehouse space, overhead (including purchase of Quickbooks, 
marketing, website, social channel presence, and potential help packing
 boxes, etc.)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>How it’ll Work</b></h3>
<p><i>This is a buy-one-give-one program, where your purchase of a subscription box provides one for a trans youth in need. <br/></i></p>
<p><i>The youth will be nominated by their center or a friend/relative.</i>
 If they're not out to anyone, they can nominate themselves. We’ve 
reached out to every center we can find, and we will let them know when 
we’re ready to accept nominations. The age of the potential recipient, 
as well as the timing of the nomination, and finally filling out the 
paperwork that allows us to fulfill all of our internal needs (for 
things like reporting), will be the one of the only 2 necessary criteria
 to become a receiver of a subscription-- the other will be being 24 or 
younger.</p>
<p><i>Logistics. </i>For sponsors, we'll be switching information over to either <a href=""http://cratejoy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cratejoy.com</a>
 or WooCommerce, where we'll create accounts for you in order to track 
boxes, preferences, etc! Youth subscriptions may be taken over to one of
 these places-- but we're working out the logistics and safety measures.</p>

<b><br/></b><h3><b>Final Request</b></h3>
<p>This
 is, in so many ways, a community project-- shaped and un-roughed by 
many hands, hearts, and tireless hours of labor. If you love this 
project, please support it financially (if you're able). If you're

</div></div>","The Problem: 



Nearly ½ of trans persons have seriously considered suicide.* They're
 also far more likely to attempt.
Collectively, gender-diverse and trans people are also far more likely to be victims of interpersonal violence.* The Trans Murder Monitoring Project reports 1,374 deaths since January 2008. 
78% of gender non-conforming youth report “significant abuse at school.”* 
It’s also a diversity issue.* Hispanic and Black youth who identify as transgender or gender diverse in any way are twice as likely to attempt suicide.

We want this to change. We believe we can play a role in that change, with you.


Our Solution:
We see access to the simplest things can be denied. We
 want to provide trans and gender-diverse youth with an easy means to 
get what they need-- be it toiletries, clothing, or higher-end items like
 binders, binaried clothing, and bras.Subscription boxes are a trending way of trying out new products, or getting access to things you need every so-often. We'd like to provide subscription boxes with pride items, books selected by the community around this project (see our ""Community"" header, later), binders, bras, clothing item of the binary the recipient wants, and other great items into a completely customizeable subscription box package.Every box purchased by a sponsor gives one to a trans or non-binary spectrum youth. This is the most important part of the project to us. Providing youth with access to items which they may need, and also providing them with a Letter of Encouragement (which will be handwritten and unique, and come in every youth box), is a small way of helping trans youth who might be in an un-supportive or financially strapped home.

<p>Hi, my name is Jeff Frost, I live in Reno, NV and I am very outgoing and passionate about this project, I would like to first thank you for visiting our funding page. I believe that you will find that we have a very interesting project that we are looking for funding. I know that most people do and do not support the use of cannabis.</p>
<p>I must say that no matter what if you do or do not support the marijuana industry, it is a growing industry state by state. Many state laws prohibit the use of marijuana in public, what I’m doing is nothing new, there are social clubs or lounges in Colorado, California, Oregon and Washington which all have legalize marijuana for recreational use. We will be much different than the clubs/lounges in other states as we have much different laws on what we can do an offer to cannabis users.</p>
<p>Nevada has become one of those states that has legalized marijuana for recreational use. Nevada is legal for several things which gives the state it's biggest boost for tourism, we are a 24-hour state with drinking, gambling and prostitution. We will be the first club/lounge in Reno, NV for cannabis users, we are looking for your support to those looking to use cannabis in a social environment. We ask that you read through our plan, to see how we plan to setup Your 420 Club.</p>
<p>We need your support to raise $250,000 to get Your 420 Club up and running in Reno, Nevada, we are offering several perks for your support to raise capital. We ask for your support whether it’s $1 or $600, we are offering some great perks to help support our project.</p>
<p>With your support to Your 420 Club you will help create 20 new job to our economy in the Reno area. These are the perks we are offering;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mini Key Chain Flashlight</li>
<li>Wafer USB Card 4GB</li>
<li>Card Power Bank to charge a cell phones</li>
<li>$300 and $500 Gift Cards with a 20% return</li>
<li>Club Memberships at 50% off.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please take the time and read through our plan and support our efforts to make our dreams become a reality. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Problem Worth Solving</h3>
<p>Nevada will be legal for recreational marijuana use after Jan. 1, 2017. Adults 21 and older can possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis, or one-eighth of an ounce of cannabis concentrate, smoking or consuming it in public will remain outlawed, punishable by a fine of up to $600.  That law states that it’s illegal to drive with certain levels of marijuana in a driver’s system. Those limits are 10 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of marijuana or 15 ng/mL of marijuana metabolite in your urine, or a blood level of 2 ng/mL of marijuana or 5 ng/mL of metabolite.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>With our private membership club we offer a solution to smoking and consuming cannabis that is not considering a public place, offering a BYOC (Bring Your Own Cannabis) private membership club for members only to socialize along with smoking and consuming cannabis.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Target Market</h3>
<p>Market for legal marijuana is a lot bigger than some would have ever imagined. According to Fortune, “a new report by a leading marijuana industry investment and research firm found legal cannabis sales jumped 17%, to $6.9 billion, in 2016 and they will grow by a whopping 25% this year to reach $8.1 billion in total U.S. sales.”</p>
<p><strong>Who are the consumers of legal marijuana?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The average recreational marijuana consumer is 37 years old</li>
<li>Marijuana dispensaries serve customers 21-95</li>
<li>The average marijuana consumer spends $33 on weed per trip to dispensary</li>
<li>Weed smokers spent $645 on average in the last year buying pot</li>
<li>There are more than twice as many men than women in the customer loyalty program</li>
</ul>
<p>We will target cannabis users in our local market area and will also target tourism coming into Nevada to use cannabis. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>Currently there are no private cannabis clubs in Nevada because the legalization of marijuana in Nevada with medical marijuana laws in January 1, 2000 it has taken 16 years before the state started issuing business licenses to sell medical marijuana. It will be another 18 months before Nevada starts issuing business licenses to sell for recreational use. The current medical marijuana businesses will be grandfathered in and with the new marijuana law for recreational use taking effect January 1, 2017 this opens the door for private clubs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Advantages</h3>
<p>We have the opportunity to be the first private cannabis club in Nevada in Reno. With Your 420 Club being the first we will be able to capture a large target of cannabis users.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Marketing Plan</h3>
<p>We will contact all of the marijuana dispensaries and will give information and marketing material for people who buy cannabis from the dispensaries regarding where they can smoke or consume cannabis. We will also have an online presence with a website and use online SEO to advertise the club with an online presence that will help locals and tourist locate our clubs. We will also create printed marketing material to hand out along with signage on each location. </p>
<p>We also have plans to increase 7 day trail membership by using a channel through the tourism industry to get more monthly memberships. We will offer current monthly member an opportunity to bring a guest night to increase membership. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Sales Plan</h3>
<p>Our sales approach is basic, we offer a private place to smoke or consume cannabis. All you have to do is be over the age of 21 years old, bring your own cannabis and purchase a membership, we provide all paraphernalia to our members to use cannabis in the club. We have 3 memberships to choose from:</p>
<ol>
<li>7 day trail membership (Great for tourism)</li>
<li>Po'Boy membership (12 month commitment)</li>
<li>Gambler membership (12 month commitment)</li>
<li>VIP membership (12 month commitment)</li>
</ol>
<p>We will have several areas that will generate more revenue in the club, rentals of VIP areas, pool tables, dart boards, alcoholic beverages, sodas and cigarettes. Only VIP members will not have to rent VIP areas, pool tables or the dart boards.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Locations &amp; Facilities</h3>
<p>The location in Reno will be anywhere from 3,000-4,500sqft, with a location close to downtown Reno, with the location being open 24 hours, since we are in a 24 hour town.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>We will have a membership software program to keep track of club members and we will also have club cards that you will need to enter the club. All membership signup must be in person to check age requirements, we will only be accepting credit card as payment.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Equipment &amp; Tools</h3>
<p>We will be purchasing bar equipment, lighting, cameras, computers/tablets, paraphernalia for using cannabis, signage, tv's, pool tables, dart boards, jukebox, tables, chairs, booths, poker table, smoke filtration system, bar glasses, cigarette vending machine, liquor, beer, soda and food preparation area.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Key Metrics</h3>
<p>Since our prices are fixed, we are focused on maximizing our unit counts. How many memberships, alcohol, etc. — can we sell? Likewise, because our prices have such a wide range, we want to keep a close eye on our mix of sales. If we are selling monthly memberships but not selling VIP memberships, we are going to have to work a lot harder for the money.</p>
<p>Our costs are relatively consistent with the major exception of labor. We want to staff our crews generously to provide fast, top-notch service. If we don’t keep our membership counts up, though, our labor costs per membership will climb, so we are watching that closely too.</p>

</div></div>","Hi, my name is Jeff Frost, I live in Reno, NV and I am very outgoing and passionate about this project, I would like to first thank you for visiting our funding page. I believe that you will find that we have a very interesting project that we are looking for funding. I know that most people do and do not support the use of cannabis.
I must say that no matter what if you do or do not support the marijuana industry, it is a growing industry state by state. Many state laws prohibit the use of marijuana in public, what I’m doing is nothing new, there are social clubs or lounges in Colorado, California, Oregon and Washington which all have legalize marijuana for recreational use. We will be much different than the clubs/lounges in other states as we have much different laws on what we can do an offer to cannabis users.
Nevada has become one of those states that has legalized marijuana for recreational use. Nevada is legal for several things which gives the state it's biggest boost for tourism, we are a 24-hour state with drinking, gambling and prostitution. We will be the first club/lounge in Reno, NV for cannabis users, we are looking for your support to those looking to use cannabis in a social environment. We ask that you read through our plan, to see how we plan to setup Your 420 Club.
We need your support to raise $250,000 to get Your 420 Club up and running in Reno, Nevada, we are offering several perks for your support to raise capital. We ask for your support whether it’s $1 or $600, we are offering some great perks to help support our project.

Problem Worth Solving
Nevada will be legal for recreational marijuana use after Jan. 1, 2017. Adults 21 and older can possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis, or one-eighth of an ounce of cannabis concentrate, smoking or consuming it in public will remain outlawed, punishable by a fine of up to $600.  That law states that it’s illegal to drive with certain levels of marijuana in a driver’s system. Those limits are 10 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of marijuana or 15 ng/mL of marijuana metabolite in your urine, or a blood level of 2 ng/mL of marijuana or 5 ng/mL of metabolite.
 
Our Solution
With our private membership club we offer a solution to smoking and consuming cannabis that is not considering a public place, offering a BYOC (Bring Your Own Cannabis) private membership club for members only to socialize along with smoking and consuming cannabis.
 
Target Market
Market for legal marijuana is a lot bigger than some would have ever imagined. According to Fortune, “a new report by a leading marijuana industry investment and research firm found legal cannabis sales jumped 17%, to $6.9 billion, in 2016 and they will grow by a whopping 25% this year to reach $8.1 billion in total U.S. sales.”
Who are the consumers of legal marijuana?

The average recreational marijuana consumer is 37 years old
Marijuana dispensaries serve customers 21-95
The average marijuana consumer spends $33 on weed per trip to dispensary
Weed smokers spent $645 on average in the last year buying pot
There are more than twice as many men than women in the customer loyalty program

We will target cannabis users in our local market area and will also target tourism coming into Nevada to use cannabis.

<h2><strong>Summary of the story</strong></h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Help Caesar Bishovu and friends start up an on line banking savings and credit cooperative in Uganda, Kampala!!!!!!!!!!!!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>'' Caesar Bishovu and friends are starting up an on line banking Savings and Credit Co-operative (SACCO) in Uganda, Kampala; a modern and multipurpose SACCO project entitled “Refugee women empowerment through self-reliance”, which is an innovative project designed and developed by World Youth Organization (WYO), its partners, different interested individuals and personalities as well as other stakeholders to support the cause!!! ''</strong></p> <p>My name is Caesar Bishovu, I am a Social Economic Development and Human Rights Activist on bias in refugee rights. For the moment I am the Founder and Director of World Youth Organization (WYO), which is a refugee-led and community based organization operating in Kampala, Uganda.</p>
<p>I am inviting you to join our efforts for fundraising of the <strong>“Refugee women empowerment through self-reliance”</strong> project. In this process, we need your help and assistance in one way or another.</p>
<p>As special rewards in exchange, I would like to inform you that all willing people, who are going to give in their financial contributions for this cause that there is an opportunity of getting shares (a set of membership fees including one share is equivalent to $ 30)  in return within this modern and multipurpose savings and credit co-operative with the latest technology of an on line banking system in order to extend the financial services to the vulnerable people and their communities in critical living conditions!!! Otherwise all funds collected will be considered as donations and therefore in this project, we are ready to assess and accept, if possible, any other reasonable and possible suggestions as it may be requested by our potential funders and partners!!!</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration and support!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The story </strong></h3>
<p>World Youth Organization (WYO) was initially incorporated on the September 23, 2009 as a Company Limited by guarantee without share capital. Then on the June 18, 2013 World Youth Organization was registered with the National Bureau for Non-Governmental Organizations. Since its incorporation, the organization has carried its activities in the fields of promoting human rights, education, health conditions and better standards of vulnerable persons living in Kampala suburbs including refugee youth, women, men, elderly and persons living with disabilities as well as other nationals of low income status in Uganda among others.</p>
<p>Normally the organization raised fund from contributions of members and friends who supported the cause of refugee advocacy using Bottom-Up approach, self-reliance and self-representation of refugees including youth and women in decision making, serving better fellow urban refugees and filling gaps where necessary.</p>
<p>As achievements, World Youth Organization managed to support 300 self-employed, who operated in informal sector to start up and develop their small and medium enterprises. And the organization had formed and supported the following working groups including social economic activities like hair salons, catering services, tailoring, art and craft designs, shoes making, yoghurt making, sewing, modern farming and agriculture, environment conservation and protection  etc. as well as cultural and sports clubs; WYO Traditional Cultural Troupe; WYO Young Stars (a Football Club of Boys Under 14 years); WYO FC (a Football Club of Boys Above 18); WYO Basketball Boys; WYO Basketball Girls; WYO Volleyball Boys; WYO Volleyball Girls; WYO Acrobatics Club; WYO Kung-Fu Club; WYO Swimming Club; WYO Vision Bit Entertainment; WYO Arts &amp; Design Group, and WYO SACCO etc.  </p>
<p>Although due to limited access to direct funding for refugee initiatives, in 2014 the organization faced serious shortages of funding and its promoters decided to suspend all its activities in June 2014 and members opted to continue their social economic activities in informal way either through their above mentioned working groups or individually.</p>
<p>In 2019 according to the advice, support and promises of friends, the members of the organization agreed to resume the work. And now World Youth Organization is planning to officially resume its activities, since the organization’s programs and its members had been affected by COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis. </p>
<p>At the end of the year 2019, there had been an outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic Disease of which, the first cases were detected and confirmed in Wuhan, China (<a href=""https://ghrp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41256-020-00135-6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ghrp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186...</a>). And since then the disease started being spread to almost all countries in the world including Uganda. The pandemic has continued affecting all categories of people including refugees living in rural refugee settlements and urban areas in one way or another. According to the statistics of refugees and asylum seekers in Uganda published by UNHCR and OPM on March 21, 2021, refugees and asylum seekers are 1,470,858 and in Kampala they are 91,223 (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/map/uganda/refugees-and-asylum-seekers-uganda-31-march-2021"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://reliefweb.int/map/uganda/refugees-and-a...</a>).</p>
<p>On March 26, 2020, lock down was officially announced in Uganda to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 (<a href=""https://www.health.go.ug/2020/05/14/update-on-covid-19-response-in-uganda/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.health.go.ug/2020/05/14/update-on-c...</a>); all social and economic activities including public places such as markets, shops, offices were suspended. The prolonged lock down has affected all people at different levels; public servants but mostly people in private sector, where people earn as they work daily especially those who are engaged in small and medium enterprises, in which many urban refugees are either formally or informally engaged to earn a living.  </p>
<p>This kind of situation has worsened living conditions of urban refugees living in Kampala and its suburbs especially vulnerable refugee women, youth, elderly and other refugees living with disabilities, chronic diseases and their families since they have spent many months without working. And up to now they are facing many challenges including unemployment, food shortages, arrears of non paid residential houses rent, school dropout and other education issues affecting refugee children without support, shops and offices rent bills, capital shortages to run and sustain their small business projects etc.</p>
<p>Due to the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic crisis and its effects, while considering criteria, requirements, policies or conditionality of servicing loans in Uganda, many people from different refugee-led organizations and their respective refugee communities, have been disqualified for having access to loans that even in most cases are not enough for both, the monthly businesses and personal budgets of the borrowers. And many of those who had managed to receive loans, failed partially or totally to pay back loans plus interests on time, which has negatively affected their businesses and finally made them going bankrupt.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns within the microfinance industry in Uganda, World Youth Organization is planning to set up a <strong>“</strong><strong>Refugee women empowerment through self-reliance” </strong>innovative project that would be implemented by <strong>W</strong>orld <strong>Y</strong>outh <strong>O</strong>rganization <strong>S</strong>taff &amp; <strong>C</strong>ommunity <strong>S</strong>avings and <strong>C</strong>redit <strong>Co</strong>-operative Society Limited (<strong>WYOSCSACCO</strong>), which is the first modern leading refugee-led multipurpose savings and credit cooperative in Uganda, that we are planning to develop to a higher level by using the latest technologies of the on line banking system as the Response to COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis in order to extend financial services to the most vulnerable refugees and their communities living in and around Kampala suburbs. And this will be done in clause collaboration with World Youth Organization’s partners, different interested individuals and personalities as well as other stakeholders to support the cause.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Goal </strong></h3>
<p>The project aims at fostering social economic welfare of vulnerable refugee women and unemployed youth in particular and refugee communities in needs and other vulnerable people including nationals in Kampala by setting up an on line banking microfinance institution that would, to them, provide easy financial services and accessible savings and credit services at fair interest rates and monthly repayment modalities as well as the eventual benefits being enhancing their improved social welfare through various working groups for Income Generating Activities (IGAs).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Objectives </strong></h3>
<p>To provide modern multipurpose innovative and appropriate on line banking Savings and Credit Co-operative (SACCO) system, which will provide financial solutions to its members for economic transformation and economic empowerment with the effective preventive measures against the spread of Covid-19 Pandemic Disease etc.; </p>
<p>To provide savings, deposits and related services earning competitive rates of interest in a professional manner and minimizing financial risks on such savings that will transform livelihoods of the members, their communities and the society at large;</p>
<p>To carry out systematic sensitization in refugees communities exposing members to techniques and methods used for small and medium business startups and encourage them for benefiting from the SACCO and other partners' programs and services;</p>
<p>To organizing vocational trainings and capacity building trainings and impart business knowledge and skills which would enable refugee women and youth in particular and other urban refugees in general to provide employment through working groups, innovative projects and prepare simple business plans in order to ensure the sustainability of their businesses and the proper utilization of the loans granted;</p>
<p>To provide any other necessary legally authorized and economically feasible financial services demanded by its members and partners;</p>
<p>To ensure that the improved social welfare of vulnerable refugee women, youth and other vulnerable groups of people has deep positive ramifications in the host communities;</p>
<p>To rent and equip an on line banking Savings and Credit Co-operative (SACCO) head office in Kampala as a pilot project;</p>
<p>To establish a strong internal control system and provide Information and Communications Technology (ICT) connections and other related infrastructure requirements to speed up service delivery; and</p>
<p>To provide loan services at cost allowing the SACCO to cover its costs including legal reserves, for loan losses and other required reserves etc.  </p>

<p>Business Loans (the aim of this loan is to assist members in their business development projects); Emergency Loans (the aim of the loan is to assist members solving unexpected situations of personal problems); Educational Loans (the aim of the loan is to make an education possible when there is no other ways; and Development Loans (the aim of this loan is to assist members in their development projects).</p>
<p>In addition to voluntary savings and contributing allocated and regulated shares, members, on their own will, will open fixed deposit accounts and any other saving product a member feels that is beneficial as SACCO especially encourages loans against cash security.</p>
<p>For the period of three years ahead, World Youth Organization Staff &amp; Community Savings and Credit Co-operative Society Limited (WYOSCSACCO) plans to achieve remarkable progress towards its long-term goals. It will continue to build a strong and more competitive on line banking micro financial institution that provides quality service to its members including vulnerable refugee women, youth, elderly and persons living with disabilities with a climate, in which members can fulfill their personal, social and economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Amount of money needed is $ 100,000 </strong>(One hundred thousand United States Dollars). And the Crowd funding Campaign is going to take two months, which can be extended if necessary.

Thank you for your consideration and support!!!
 
The story 
World Youth Organization (WYO) was initially incorporated on the September 23, 2009 as a Company Limited by guarantee without share capital. Then on the June 18, 2013 World Youth Organization was registered with the National Bureau for Non-Governmental Organizations. Since its incorporation, the organization has carried its activities in the fields of promoting human rights, education, health conditions and better standards of vulnerable persons living in Kampala suburbs including refugee youth, women, men, elderly and persons living with disabilities as well as other nationals of low income status in Uganda among others.
Normally the organization raised fund from contributions of members and friends who supported the cause of refugee advocacy using Bottom-Up approach, self-reliance and self-representation of refugees including youth and women in decision making, serving better fellow urban refugees and filling gaps where necessary.
As achievements, World Youth Organization managed to support 300 self-employed, who operated in informal sector to start up and develop their small and medium enterprises. And the organization had formed and supported the following working groups including social economic activities like hair salons, catering services, tailoring, art and craft designs, shoes making, yoghurt making, sewing, modern farming and agriculture, environment conservation and protection  etc. as well as cultural and sports clubs; WYO Traditional Cultural Troupe; WYO Young Stars (a Football Club of Boys Under 14 years); WYO FC (a Football Club of Boys Above 18); WYO Basketball Boys; WYO Basketball Girls; WYO Volleyball Boys; WYO Volleyball Girls; WYO Acrobatics Club; WYO Kung-Fu Club; WYO Swimming Club; WYO Vision Bit Entertainment; WYO Arts & Design Group, and WYO SACCO etc.  
Although due to limited access to direct funding for refugee initiatives, in 2014 the organization faced serious shortages of funding and its promoters decided to suspend all its activities in June 2014 and members opted to continue their social economic activities in informal way either through their above mentioned working groups or individually.
In 2019 according to the advice, support and promises of friends, the members of the organization agreed to resume the work. And now World Youth Organization is planning to officially resume its activities, since the organization’s programs and its members had been affected by COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis. 
At the end of the year 2019, there had been an outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic Disease of which, the first cases were detected and confirmed in Wuhan, China (https://ghrp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186...). And since then the disease started being spread to almost all countries in the world including Uganda. The pandemic has continued affecting all categories of people including refugees living in rural refugee settlements and urban areas in one way or another. According to the statistics of refugees and asylum seekers in Uganda published by UNHCR and OPM on March 21, 2021, refugees and asylum seekers are 1,470,858 and in Kampala they are 91,223 (https://reliefweb.int/map/uganda/refugees-and-a...).
On March 26, 2020, lock down was officially announced in Uganda to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 (https://www.health.go.ug/2020/05/14/update-on-c...); all social and economic activities including public places such as markets, shops, offices were suspended. The prolonged lock down has affected all people at different levels; public servants but mostly people in private sector, where people earn as they work daily especially those who are engaged in small and medium enterprises, in which many urban refugees are either formally or informally engaged to earn a living.  
This kind of situation has worsened living conditions of urban refugees living in Kampala and its suburbs especially vulnerable refugee women, youth, elderly and other refugees living with disabilities, chronic diseases and their families since they have spent many months without working. And up to now they are facing many challenges including unemployment, food shortages, arrears of non paid residential houses rent, school dropout and other education issues affecting refugee children without support, shops and offices rent bills, capital shortages to run and sustain their small business projects etc.
Due to the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic crisis and its effects, while considering criteria, requirements, policies or conditionality of servicing loans in Uganda, many people from different refugee-led organizations and their respective refugee communities, have been disqualified for having access to loans that even in most cases are not enough for both, the monthly businesses and personal budgets of the borrowers. And many of those who had managed to receive loans, failed partially or totally to pay back loans plus interests on time, which has negatively affected their businesses and finally made them going bankrupt.
In response to these concerns within the microfinance industry in Uganda, World Youth Organization is planning to set up a “Refugee women empowerment through self-reliance” innovative project that would be implemented by World Youth Organization Staff & Community Savings and Credit Co-operative Society Limited (WYOSCSACCO), which is the first modern leading refugee-led multipurpose savings and credit cooperative in Uganda, that we are planning to develop to a higher level by using the latest technologies of the on line banking system as the Response to COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis in order to extend financial services to the most vulnerable refugees and their communities living in and around Kampala suburbs. And this will be done in clause collaboration with World Youth Organization’s partners, different interested individuals and personalities as well as other stakeholders to support the cause.
 
Goal 
The project aims at fostering social economic welfare of vulnerable refugee women and unemployed youth in particular and refugee communities in needs and other vulnerable people including nationals in Kampala by setting up an on line banking microfinance institution that would, to them, provide easy financial services and accessible savings and credit services at fair interest rates and monthly repayment modalities as well as the eventual benefits being enhancing their improved social welfare through various working groups for Income Generating Activities (IGAs).
 
Objectives 
To provide modern multipurpose innovative and appropriate on line banking Savings and Credit Co-operative (SACCO) system, which will provide financial solutions to its members for economic transformation and economic empowerment with the effective preventive measures against the spread of Covid-19 Pandemic Disease etc.; 
To provide savings, deposits and related services earning competitive rates of interest in a professional manner and minimizing financial risks on such savings that will transform livelihoods of the members, their communities and the society at large;
To carry out systematic sensitization in refugees communities exposing members to techniques and methods used for small and medium business startups and encourage them for benefiting from the SACCO and other partners' programs and services;
To organizing vocational trainings and capacity building trainings and impart business knowledge and skills which would enable refugee women and youth in particular and other urban refugees in general to provide employment through working groups, innovative projects and prepare simple business plans in order to ensure the sustainability of their businesses and the proper utilization of the loans granted;
To provide any other necessary legally authorized and economically feasible financial services demanded by its members and partners;
To ensure that the improved social welfare of vulnerable refugee women, youth and other vulnerable groups of people has deep positive ramifications in the host communities;
To rent and equip an on line banking Savings and Credit Co-operative (SACCO) head office in Kampala as a pilot project;
To establish a strong internal control system and provide Information and Communications Technology (ICT) connections and other related infrastructure requirements to speed up service delivery; and
To provide loan services at cost allowing the SACCO to cover its costs including legal reserves, for loan losses and other required reserves etc.

The on line banking SACCO services to improve social economic status of urban refugees, and in the settlements will supplement relief services provided by refugee supporting organizations.
The hosting communities will automatically emirate refugees activities geared towards facilitating their economic conditions.
 
Sustainability 
Availability of crowd funding is needed to help the project become sustainable; where marginal costs and marginal revenues are constant, among other assumptions.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are family of 7 (3 kids, 2 dogs), who thrive to live naturally. We're full vegans, living in nature in timber house, homeschooling our kids, spending ALL the time together, and searching for ways to lessen our negative impact and increase positive impact in this wonderful world.</p>
<p>Both of us had our businesses, and got tired of corporate life, and meaningless earnin-spending rat race. When first baby was born, we have decided to quit that life and start another- more meaningful way of living. It took 3 years for us to calm down and to find out what we want to do with our life. </p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to build Experience Rasta retreat, where people from all over the world could come to search for calmness, meaning, difficult answers or just simply to take a break. Retreat will include:</p>
<p>* Camper conversion rental</p>
<p>* Air BnB tiny houses on the shore of the beautiful lake</p>
<p>* Boat rental for guests </p>
<p>* Sightseeing flights </p>
<p>* Various workshops</p>
<p>The most important, is that we're going live there and will give our personal attention to our guests, meaning not only giving the keys, but sharing life experiences and views. Giving advice about natural and different way of life, if asked.</p>
<p>As You may understand, it will require financing, and without Your contribution it is extremely difficult to make it come true. </p>
<p>First step is camper conversion rental, which purpose is to give a taste of the whole concept, as well as to spread the word about upcoming retreat.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 30000 Eur. For 3 van conversions.</p>
<p>Breakdown is very simple:</p>
<p>5000 Eur van + 5000 Eur conversion = 10000 Eur/ van * 3 = 30000Eur. </p>
<p>We are choosing flexible goal, because if we raise less, we still have opportunity to start with one van.</p>
<p>We will, of course keep You updated, where Your money goes. If we'll see, that raised money will not help us to do anything towards our goal, we will cancel campaign, and You'll be refunded. </p>
<p>What You will get? Free camper rental! (duration depends on Your contribution)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have rented couple of motorhomes before, and despite they were new, it was plastic box, with no soul. We love idea of every product having soul, and therefore, we are ready to put our love into conversion, so You could enjoy the difference. Maybe that will inspire people to demand more from manufactures, and service providers. Why should You settle for less? </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If You can not contribute with donation, share this campaign on Your social media. That will help a ton! Thank You for caring!</p>

<p>Short Summary</p>
<p>PJ and Rebekah Warren have been married for 5 years. Unable to have children, they turned their love to dogs. In the heat of Mesa, AZ they have found that finding a haven for your dogs can be hard so they decided to create a space for their community to gather and cool off. We need your help to make that dream a reality.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We are seeking to raise $300,000 to build an indoor dog park that also offers remote office space for humans, dog day care, and boarding. We want this space to be a community gather place where all feel like family and their dogs get the care they deserve as your fur babies. If we do not meet the fund goal, we will keep working at it until we can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>Mesa does not currently have indoor places to take dogs that do not require day care or is part of a pet shop. We want to change that and create a safe space to mingle and connect. We are helping those who serve our community by reducing the costs to board their pets so they can keep achieving their career goals and also have their pet family.</p>

</div>
<p>It's been the world's most
popular drink for hundreds of years, if not longer, and you'd be hard-pressed
to find a person who doesn’t have some understanding of what it's all about.
Coffee is everywhere . . . it's almost what you would call “commonplace.” And
that's exactly how I looked at coffee five years ago. I enjoyed drinking it, of
course, as a vast majority of people do. But like that same majority, I never
really understood coffee. I knew nothing about the beans, the roasting, or the
people thousands of miles away that made it possible for me to drink a hot cup
in the morning.</p>
<p>But we were not Coffeetales if we would not have a tale for you so grab a cup of coffee and lean back...</p>

<p>…Toby a young boy and his new
bride Daniela were still laughing about the monkey they saw cavorting just
outside the Uluwatu Temple. She had been making jokes about the little fellow
they spotted the previous afternoon and somehow she managed to bring back the
topic of having kids - a topic that made Toby smile at the prospect. After all,
they were four days into their honeymoon in Indonesia, and the idea of future
kids has been in the forefront of his mind since they said their vows at the
altar.</p>
<p> On their way to Tanah Lot the crashing blue
coastline came into view. He took a deep breath of salt-laden air – one of
those things people always do when they approach the sea or the ocean – and
then looked over to his wonderful wife Daniela, just to see her smile. That's
when his eyes caught sight of Batur. From where they were standing, the mighty
seven-thousand-foot volcano looked like it was touching the beautiful blue sky,
which was nearly as blue as the waters they were approaching. Still, it wasn't
just the scenic view that suddenly caught his attention.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Daniela asked him.</p>
<p>“The volcano,” He said. “There's
a lot of them around here.”</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443415945/hvo0jk0xangtea65bdtq.png"" src="""" style=""width: 578.3193277310925px; height: 333px;""/></p><br/>
<p>“And you're noticing this just
now?” she smiled. “The guides have been talking about them for days. You really
must be distracted!”</p>
<p>“Well, no. It's not that. I just
realized...” He grinned. “Oh, nevermind. My mind's just wandering.”</p>
<p>“Stop wandering and look”, she
pointed. “Isn't that amazing?”</p>
<p>He turned back to their
destination and spotted Tanah Lot, a temple built on a large offshore rock.
While the waves crashed all around it, the tourists who had already mounted the
steps to the top shielded their faces from the resulting spray. The temple
truly was a sight to behold, with its foundation half-covered in the ebbing and
surging waters of the Indian Ocean. As they crossed the waters and climbed up
the steps to the top of Tanah Lot, which was a short twenty foot climb, Toby
looked back toward Bratan. </p>
<p>“Honey”, he said turning to
Daniela, who could now see the fierce determination in his eyes “I know where I
want to go next.” </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443416396/pofn8xe7ap1yoidwswk8.png"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; width: 289.8px; height: 161px;""/><br/></p><p></p><div>The next morning they woke up very early because they had a long drive ahead of them. Daniela had asked Toby several times why they were heading all the way to the agricultural fields near
the village of Ubud. He didn’t respond, not because he didn’t want to, but
because he hoped to find the right answer when they arrived.</div><p></p>
<p>The highlands were surrounded by
lush greenery and a vast expanse of coffee plants as far as the eye could see,
each of them showing clusters of reddish-brown cherries. Coffee, he surmised
from what he has seen in pictures. He pulled over to the side of the road.</p>
<p>“What's going on?” Daniela asked.</p>
<p>“Right there,” he pointed toward
a man standing among big rows of broad-leafed plants. It looked like he was
examining their fruit. Daniela just grinned and shrugged, apparently she was
confused by his sudden desire for adventures. He smiled back and jumped out of
the car. </p>
<p>Toby stood in the field talking
to the man for at least an hour, telling him about his new wife and their
honeymoon trip and afterwards asking him about his work and the farm.  The man named Katut didn't just tell him
about the soil and the coffee cherries, he told him about the family plantation
that had been passed down through generations and about the methods of
harvesting and roasting which his own grandfather had taught him thirty years
back. Toby listened intently, processing and absorbing every word. Katut didn't
stop until he heard Toby’s stomach growl. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443416651/qo1epofzbdiuiulu98si.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>“I am being a poor host,” he said
at that sound. “You and your beautiful wife must be hungry.“ He waved at
Daniela who was still sitting in the car enjoying the beautiful view. She
stepped out of the car and made her way through the plants to her husband and
his new acquaintance. Toby introduced her to the very friendly man who led the
couple to a beautiful little cottage near the edge of a hill. In front of the
cottage there was little bench and a small table. As they sat down they
couldn’t believe their eyes. The view over the coffee plantation was simply
astonishing. A couple of minutes passed while they just sat there and took in the
view.</p>
<p>„Beautiful out here, ain’t it?“
said Katut after he came back with a small basket that seemed to be full.</p>
<p>„Yes, it’s wonderful indeed,“
Toby answered smiling. </p>
<p>Out of the basket the took a
large hunk of cheese, a bowl of rice, and a large bottle of tea. Their trip to
this beautiful place made them forget all about food but now they realized how
hungry they actually were. The highlight of the meal came when the Katut opened
a can of hot coffee. He placed the cup in front of the young man and gave him a
satisfied look. Toby waited a while for the beverage to cool off a little and
afterwards he took a sip. He was profoundly amazed at the taste of this fresh
roasted coffee.</p>
<p>Now Katut’s smile turned into a
grin. This coffee was so rich in flavor and aroma, Toby couldn’t believe it.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>„Why… I mean, how is this
possible?“ he asked, obviously still amazed by the flavor explosion he just
experienced. </p>
<p>„Well son, until now you’ve been
drinking dead beans, just like everybody else.“</p>
<p>„Dead beans?“ Toby was astonished.</p>
<p>„Yes, dead beans. You can store
green coffee beans up to three years without losing quality, but as soon as you
roast them, the flavor starts to decrease exponentially after two weeks.“</p>
<p>„But why doesn’t anyone know
about this?“ Toby wondered.</p>
<p>„Because the big coffee producers
benefit from a long shelf life. That means that they can roast tons of coffee
beans at once and keep them in stores for ages.“</p>
<p>Now Toby was visibly annoyed.
„This is really upsetting! Everyone should be able to drink such an amazingly
good coffee.“ He took a deep breath and waited a few moments. </p>
<p>„Please Katut teach me everything
about coffee and roasting coffee beans!“ Toby then begged. </p>
<p>„I will show you everything you
need to know,“ Katut promised with a grin on his face. He was so happy to have
found people who were interested in quality coffee, or rather be found by such
people.</p>
<p>The following days Katut showed
Toby and Daniela everything, from picking, then peeling the husks, then drying
and lastly to roasting the beans.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443417118/dks2gvqmgmutf4qeactx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443417258/hjmktl3kldh0zreejska.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443417474/dxb5wyrcn2vkwacsx3ro.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>On the last evening before their
departure, the young couple sat again on the bench and enjoyed the beautiful
sunset over the coffee farm.</p>
<p> “So, what’s next on your agenda? Or are you
still not telling me where we’re supposed to be going?” Daniela asked while
they were sipping a cup of coffee. </p>
<p>“This“ he said pointing at the
coffee farm „is the reason why I wanted to come out here,” He smiled. “And now
I also know what I want to do next.”</p>
<p>“You want to be a coffee farmer?”
she was visibly amused.</p>
<p>“Not quite,”  Toby said. “I want to sell the coffee from
farms just like this one. But it's not just about the coffee, you see. It's
about what's behind the coffee . . . <i>who
is</i> behind it. Every blend of coffee, every roast, every bean has a story,
right? Just like Katut’s story. That's what makes each cup special.”</p>
<p>Katut, who quietly walked towards
the couple heard about Toby’s plan and now he couldn’t help but ask him how
exactly he planned on achieving his goal.</p>
<p>Toby was quiet for a while,
remembering every single detail he has been thinking about since he came to
this farm.</p>
<p>„Well first of all, I want to
purchase a coffee roaster. I plan on storing the green beans and roast only on
order in small portions. These portions will be shipped on the same day they’re
roasted and will arrive at my customers the next day after roasting, so they
can enjoy the whole flavor and aroma - the same aroma that I’ve enjoyed with
every cup of coffee I had on this Island. But that’s not all. I want to combine
my customers everyday coffee drinking ritual with some amazing stories related
to coffee and it’s production. So I’m thinking about including a customized
story sheet, which will tell the tale of the coffee they just received. Katut,
I really believe this is a business that needs to be created and I truly
believe I can reach a large market of people who want to have an amazing coffee
drinking experience. You have seen my work and I’m sure that you’ve noticed my
attention to detail and quality. I’m one hundred percent determined to make
this little company a key player if not a leader in the coffee industry. I will
make it my mission to take care of every funder, supporter and customer with
the upmost respect.“ </p>
<p>There was a moment of complete
silence. Then Katut said „This sounds like a good and well-thought plan. But
there’s one more thing you need to consider. How are you going to get started?“</p>
<p>„Well, I thought about that as
well…“ </p>
<p>„Of course he has,“ Daniela
thought, smiling at her husband whom she knew so well.</p>
<p>„…I am sure there are plenty of
people who, once they see my passion, will help me by donating money. Those
people, whose generous funding will help me make my dream come true, won’t go
unnoticed. In addition to being thankful to them forever, I’ll create products
and services to compliment them. And like I said, I’m sure there are people out
there who know what it means to have a dream and they’ll help me spread the
word, by sharing it with everyone.</p>
<p>„Son, I truly believe in you“,
Katut said visibly satisfied before he turned around and went to his little
cottage to get ready for bed. </p>
<p>The next morning he accompanied
the young couple to the airport. They hugged each other and said their
goodbyes. After they parted and Toby and Daniela started walking towards the gate they heard Katut’s voice last time. </p>
<p>„Son, how are you going to name
your company?“ he asked loudly. </p>
<p>Toby smiled and answered „Coffeetales.""</p><p>""Why Coffeetales?"" Katut asked.</p><p>Toby answered ""because every coffee tells a story!""  </p>

It's may come worst, it's may take a lot of time. Yes, it's break all
of your plan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>Do
you really want a solution for this?</b></p>
<p>
Yes,
we have the solution to solve this problem quickly.</p>
<p>In
Vietnam right now and I think like any other country in the world, a
smartphone with 3G and the next 4G connection in every pocket become
normally with no doubt. 2015 statistic show that Vietnam have 123.8
million mobile internet connection :) larger than population (that
mean people have from 1-2 smartphone each, not include children and
elder). Source:

</p>
<p>
<b>The
solution simply is</b>:
Take out your phone run a mobile app and send the SOS message, the
app will show you the nearest services point or any other service
provider among 100.000 point around the country to receive this notification to come to help you based
on your location that has been shown to them.</p><div></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442284709/k1nll4b46lfpxsh4be7k.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>
<p>
It's
like Uber or GrabTaxi solution, it will bring the needed to come
together instantly. The service not only circle in car and motorbike

You
are in or plan to be in Vietnam or some other country like us as
India, Malaysia or Philippine...? Let think about the risks could be
happen when you enter to the traffic system, the social and how do
you think that the peoples in this country suffer from this mess?

Yes,
I think that the government do so much to ensure that it could be
safer but it take time seen limit of resource and capabilities.

But
what happen if you or any other be in troubles everyday?


Call
	for help from friends, police, family, or any other services you
	know?


Ask
	for the nearest service supplier to get support?


Fix
	or manage yourself?

.


Tons
of problems you have to solve and decide what to do with uncertainty.
It's may come worst, it's may take a lot of time. Yes, it's break all
of your plan.

Do
you really want a solution for this?

Yes,
we have the solution to solve this problem quickly.
In
Vietnam right now and I think like any other country in the world, a
smartphone with 3G and the next 4G connection in every pocket become
normally with no doubt. 2015 statistic show that Vietnam have 123.8
million mobile internet connection :) larger than population (that
mean people have from 1-2 smartphone each, not include children and
elder). Source:
http://chabrol.net/2015/06/09/internet-statistics-in-vietnam-2015/


The
solution simply is:
Take out your phone run a mobile app and send the SOS message, the
app will show you the nearest services point or any other service
provider among 100.000 point around the country to receive this notification to come to help you based
on your location that has been shown to them.

It's
like Uber or GrabTaxi solution, it will bring the needed to come
together instantly. The service not only circle in car and motorbike
trouble but also extend to other instant matching like: Police;
Parking lots; Household repair; Travel rental; HomeStay and Hotel...
in the future. 


Some
people said to us, you are follow other model but what happen when
they extend to this services? Our answered is, this is a local
services with it owned culture, manage, running and support by local
people, local relationship, local communities: (The first 100 SOS Me services point commit to join)(The start development team...)
We
are now forming team to start work but it may take a long time seen
we didn't have enough resource to recruit a big team or also invest
into a big system.

The
solution is for free to user and other social service like police,
health care. So
if you find that our jobs can help peoples in developing country a
better serve, more certain and more safer, please help us to
speedup the process and soon go to market.  

What
We Need & What You Get


Yes,
we need fund to recruit more team, running advertisement, build and
maintaining the system (hardware and software), provide training to
the services provider to be more professional and provide better
services to consumers details as follow: 

-
Recruit
more team:
Currently we have 5 member commit to join the project but it's not
enough seen it's can be extend when the app release. We also need
money for team to keep project running to the turn point and gain
profit.-
Build
the system:
Ton of work ahead from build management software; Build the app for
iOS and app for Android; Purchase for server; Work flow, process,
evaluate the  service provider...-
Running
the system:
Mans to keep it be monitor and run; Work with communities and service
provider; Internet & Datacenter; Process the complaints; Evaluate
the quality of services that the supplier give out; Training...-
Advertisement:
Prepare and keep campaign to communities on various type as Facebook,
Google, online newspaper, TV...

We
will spend money for those thing:



Salary for team to build and running the system.


Advertisement and Social activities.

Training and check for the quality of services that provide to end
users.


Through
our survey and estimation that we've done, there is a great demand
for this model and it's bring back to end users a helpful for their
life as same as the phone that they have.

</div><p>Hello Dear Friends, Family &amp; Community!</p>
<p>We are so happy that you have chosen to spend some time
reviewing our request for help with funding of Cosmos Community Light Center. It is
our greatest pleasure to share this idea with you and we
are excited about bringing this to Kansas City! Please accept this fundraising
campaign as our formal invitation to be an integral part of building our
Community Center from the ground-up with us, as One, with compassion and
integrity.</p>
<p><b>-SHORT SUMMARY-</b></p>
<p>In short, Cosmos Community
Light Center is a place to Belong. It’s not a healing center, a church, an
education center, a bookstore, a yoga studio or a coffee shop; instead, we took
the things we liked most about all of those establishments, put them in a
blender and BOOM – out popped CCLC. </p><p>To give you an idea of the types of things the Center will offer, we wanted to share a little snippet from our presentation that's linked to below. This is a *sample* schedule that you might see on a typical week at the Center: </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439101065/d9a33qpdkjgij8yyjkvy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>For more details and
information about what the Center stands for, how we plan to put your
gracious donations into action, and what we plan to bring to YOU and
to our community through the Center, we invite you to review our
presentation, which is housed <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/secret/r1YHTCHSfl5KRy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> (we recommend viewing in Fullscreen
mode for best experience). </p>
<p><b>-WHY SUPPORT?-</b></p>
<p>The reason that we believe this type of community center is so
important today is that there are many of us who enjoy many different aspects
of culture, organic living, nature and spirituality, and yet there are not many
places where we can all truly come together as one group of like-minded
individuals to have fun, play, grow and expand our minds, while spending
amazing and joyful time with friends and neighbors in one central location. We
believe that we are at a time in our culture and history that there
is a need for a Center such as this, which allows so many beautiful and
different people to come together as One to celebrate the joys of life! And
this is why we are so excited to share this project with you today, and ask
that you please assist us in bringing this endeavor to life.</p>
<p><b>-WHAT WE NEED-</b></p>
<p>In order to open the Center
safely and minimize risk within the first 3-6 months of opening, we are seeking
$20,000. This covers everything from business licenses &amp; permits, to
securing a location to rent from, to furnishing the Center, to our Welcome
Gathering, and everything in-between. Check out this graphic to see the path
that your donations will travel. Additionally, we are 100% committed to transparency
and sharing, so know that we won’t even bat an eyelash if you reach out
requesting to see our financial plan; this is your money and your Center, and
we believe you deserve to know exactly how it’s going to be put to use and put
together. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438923464/op1pjhe2huklz4rgvy6e.png"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 1088px;""/></p><p>Please know that <b>you won’t be

<p>To us, this Center means having a chance
to bring a community of like-minded individuals together<em>under
one roof</em>; it means having a safe place to express ourselves
holistically, creatively and artistically; to learn and grow; to
unite with friends and neighbors so that we can make new friends and further
our relationships with old acquaintances; but most importantly, it means having
a <strong>PLACE TO BELONG</strong>.</p>
<p>For us, we have spent so many years not feeling as if there was
one central place where we could go to safely express ourselves in all areas of
life; a judgment-free zone so to speak, and a place to engage with community
who shares the same values and interests as we do. Yes, there was the Church
and some holistic wellness centers and education centers popping up around
town, and events that encourage the masses to come together to share in
artistic experiences, but where could you go to read a book in solitude,
meditate and pray, join with friends to watch a film or documentary, drink
coffee, write poetry and present it at an open mic night– all in one place? We
could not find this anywhere, but we so CRAVED this feeling of <strong>Oneness </strong>and <strong>Community</strong>! Thus, the
idea for the Center was born.</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: black; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/>-THE BOTTOM LINE-</b><br/></p>
<p>Friends, we hope that you see
how this is <em>so much more</em> than “just
another business”– this community center is meant to be a beacon of light,
shining brightly to all those who seek a safe harbor for themselves and their
friends and family; it is an meant to provide an <strong>EXPERIENCE </strong>for all of us; and it is meant to be ingrained within the community and provide<strong> LOVE </strong>and <b>CREATIVITY </b>and a <strong>HOME </strong>to those who so seek it, and for those
who wander, and for those who don't. </p>
<p>Whether we know you personally
or not, whether you choose to donate or not – we love each and every one of you – and we hope that we so soon get the chance to meet and greet each of you as
we Welcome you into our family, our lives, and our Center that is just as much
for YOU as it is for us. </p><p></p><p><b><br/>-CAN'T DONATE NOW?-</b></p><p>Even if you, personally, can't donate...we are sure you know someone who can. Won't you please share this with your social media world? Link to us on Facebook or Twitter. Or, be sure to stop on by once we open the Center! We'd love to see your shining faces and get to know you, and the Center would love your lovin'. </p><p>
<strong>THANK YOU </strong>for allowing us to interrupt your regularly scheduled programming for this message, and for your assistance in

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">When The Flatrock Flatbread Company came to be, the focus was pizza. In creating the best pizza around, we managed to also create some very fine breads. We started with English Muffins and Breakfast Sandwiches at the 2013 Columbus Farmers Market. We added sourdough classes in 2014 that were built on bread techniques learned through making pizza. In 2015, we're growing the pizza and catering business and we're adding a strong, classic bread bakery to stand with it all. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">With this campaign, we will be able to equip our own commercial bakery and kitchen. This will allow us to expand into baking for commercial accounts and also for your home enjoyment. We will bring a variety of traditional breads you are used to seeing in ""big cities"" and ""on TV"". We'll be able to make baguettes, boulles, batards, croissants, bagels, rolls, and sandwich loaves in large quantity. </span></p>
<p>But we can't make this leap without you.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Goal and Your Rewards</h3> <p>Our goal is to raise $20,000 which is enough to equip a kitchen with the tools we need to expand our pizza business and bring our delicious bread to Columbus. As soon as we raise our goal amount, we will be able to settle on a location to set up this kitchen. We plan to be moved in and running at full tilt by the beginning of May.</p>
<p>For helping to support this project, you have a few varieties of rewards to choose from. </p>
<h4>The Bread Club</h4>
<p>Our new bakery will kick off a completely new offering for Columbus. Around the country, bakers have been starting ""Community Supported Bakeries"" or offering ""Bread Shares"". We're starting the <b>Bread Club. </b>The Bread Club is a way for you to enjoy fresh bread every week without having to remember to order it or go to the farmers market. We will have several convenient times and locations for getting your bread for the week. You could stop by the bakery, the market, or a number of other locations we're talking with. Each week of your subscription, you'll get something we make just for the club. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291106/files/20150312182016-IndieGoGo.jpg?1426209616"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 413px;""/></p>
<p>As we get it started, we will have a 5 week cycle that would include a week with Sourdough, Baquettes, Sandwich Bread, Rolls, and a Pastry like Croissants or Bagels. All of these will be handcrafted creations made right here in Columbus. We will have the remnants of our batch for sale at the bakery and other venues as supplies last in case you need more.</p>
<p>In this campaign, we are offering the club subscriptions as rewards for supporting us in the lengths of 6 months and 3 months. We expect to be able to begin in May which gives us 25 weeks to get through October and 12 weeks to get through July. As a supporter of this campaign you will be given an option to renew your subscription when it ends in 3 or 6 months.</p>
<h4>The Bread Punch Card</h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you just aren't sure that you want bread every week, you can get a punch card which you can redeem to pick out 10 bread club selections in any proportion anytime we have bread available. </span></p>
<h4>Pizza Peel</h4>
<p>We have been working with the folks at Perfect Peel and we have what we believe to be the best pizza peel available to home cooks. It has a tight grain that allows bread and pizzas to release from the surface easily without sticking. It looks great and even has our logo etched on it. If you have a wooden pizza peel at home that causes you problems, it's not likely all your fault. This is sure to up your pizza game at home.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">Baking Classes</span></p>
<p>We had two wildly popular classes teaching how to make good and easy sourdough bread in 2014. Part of the reason we are building our own bakery is so that we have room to host more bread classes in a relaxed environment. Our schedule will include classes on Sourdough, Pizza, Waffles, and Croissants. This reward will be given out as a certificate you can redeem for any class once we have a schedule established.

<h4>Early Bird Rewards</h4>
<div>Some of our rewards are designated as Early Bird offers. These have a very limited number available at a discounted price as a special Thank You for supporting our campaign so early. If you manage to snag one of these rewards, make sure to get your friends to support our campaign with you so that we reach our goal. If we don't, you'll get your money back, but you will be without our great bread.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why Support Us?</h3> <p>One of Ben's advisors asked him how this moves the company toward his goal for ""what he wants to be when he grows up."" This was his reply:</p>
<blockquote>I want the Flatrock Flatbread Company to be a great place to work, where people are treated with respect, and where they can make a reasonable living. I want our employees to continue producing world class food for our world class neighbors. When someone works with me making pizza, they get to see amazed faces as the food is made right there and is eaten immediately. I want even more of our staff to experience the sincere thanks of our community for a job well done. Through this expansion, our staff will have a greater chance to grow and take a meaningful role in our great community as we grow.</blockquote>
<p>This is our next step toward that. Our investment in a bakery helps us grow as a community asset. It provides a way for us to serve you all year with another incredible product. By the way, you won't only be seeing our bread at home. We have several restaurants who will start carrying some specialty breads as soon as we can begin making it for them.</p>
<p>This isn't a hand out. You get to choose an incentive or Perk for your contribution which we believe to be an excellent value. We believe in it so much that we know that you will continue on as a subscriber and sign up for more classes for years to come.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>But what if...?</h3> <p>We already know that, with your support, we will make this happen. There are some challenges that we will not be able to address until we have a final location chosen for the bakery. We expect to be able to take over a location that has previously been licensed for food preparation. We have at least three options that look very good. If we have to do more building, we will have more inspections and we could run into some delays. This makes it all the more important to hit our goal quickly so we can begin getting our space set up and licensed. </p>
<p>If we don't happen to reach our goal, everything continues on as it always has. We will enter our fourth year of making the best pizza Columbus Indiana has ever seen.

</div></div>","We're Growing!
When The Flatrock Flatbread Company came to be, the focus was pizza. In creating the best pizza around, we managed to also create some very fine breads. We started with English Muffins and Breakfast Sandwiches at the 2013 Columbus Farmers Market. We added sourdough classes in 2014 that were built on bread techniques learned through making pizza. In 2015, we're growing the pizza and catering business and we're adding a strong, classic bread bakery to stand with it all. 
With this campaign, we will be able to equip our own commercial bakery and kitchen. This will allow us to expand into baking for commercial accounts and also for your home enjoyment. We will bring a variety of traditional breads you are used to seeing in ""big cities"" and ""on TV"". We'll be able to make baguettes, boulles, batards, croissants, bagels, rolls, and sandwich loaves in large quantity. 
But we can't make this leap without you.   Our Goal and Your Rewards Our goal is to raise $20,000 which is enough to equip a kitchen with the tools we need to expand our pizza business and bring our delicious bread to Columbus. As soon as we raise our goal amount, we will be able to settle on a location to set up this kitchen. We plan to be moved in and running at full tilt by the beginning of May.
For helping to support this project, you have a few varieties of rewards to choose from. 
The Bread Club
Our new bakery will kick off a completely new offering for Columbus. Around the country, bakers have been starting ""Community Supported Bakeries"" or offering ""Bread Shares"". We're starting the Bread Club. The Bread Club is a way for you to enjoy fresh bread every week without having to remember to order it or go to the farmers market. We will have several convenient times and locations for getting your bread for the week. You could stop by the bakery, the market, or a number of other locations we're talking with. Each week of your subscription, you'll get something we make just for the club. 


As we get it started, we will have a 5 week cycle that would include a week with Sourdough, Baquettes, Sandwich Bread, Rolls, and a Pastry like Croissants or Bagels. All of these will be handcrafted creations made right here in Columbus. We will have the remnants of our batch for sale at the bakery and other venues as supplies last in case you need more.
In this campaign, we are offering the club subscriptions as rewards for supporting us in the lengths of 6 months and 3 months. We expect to be able to begin in May which gives us 25 weeks to get through October and 12 weeks to get through July. As a supporter of this campaign you will be given an option to renew your subscription when it ends in 3 or 6 months.
The Bread Punch Card
If you just aren't sure that you want bread every week, you can get a punch card which you can redeem to pick out 10 bread club selections in any proportion anytime we have bread available. 
Pizza Peel
We have been working with the folks at Perfect Peel and we have what we believe to be the best pizza peel available to home cooks. It has a tight grain that allows bread and pizzas to release from the surface easily without sticking. It looks great and even has our logo etched on it. If you have a wooden pizza peel at home that causes you problems, it's not likely all your fault. This is sure to up your pizza game at home.


Baking Classes
We had two wildly popular classes teaching how to make good and easy sourdough bread in 2014. Part of the reason we are building our own bakery is so that we have room to host more bread classes in a relaxed environment. Our schedule will include classes on Sourdough, Pizza, Waffles, and Croissants. This reward will be given out as a certificate you can redeem for any class once we have a schedule established. This will depend on our timeframe for getting into the space and the certifications we will need.


Early Bird Rewards
Some of our rewards are designated as Early Bird offers. These have a very limited number available at a discounted price as a special Thank You for supporting our campaign so early. If you manage to snag one of these rewards, make sure to get your friends to support our campaign with you so that we reach our goal.

<p>Very
significant is that the tokens holders with registered wallets choose the

and quite durable or electronic decentralized as cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Value
proposition for customer: </p>
<p>Easy
transferable even abroad but without many flaws of fiat money or strongly
protected against them. Flaws which are: inflation caused by money creation or
political games, stock market games, wars, local natural or economic disasters.
</p>
<p>Build in
automated investment from savings.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>Who I am?</b></p>
<p>Software developer with economic, crypto technology and political education
and experience.</p>
<p><b>Why am I doing this project?</b></p>
<p>My life was very affected by the market gambling which generated 2009 crisis and I don`t want
any repeat of that in our future and future of our children. We don`t need to
wait for it as no legal changes are needed just our actions.</p>
<p><b>History and
background of project:</b></p>
<p>I) Is money - <span>banknotes of which almost all people in the world are
using, have a real - minimal protected value?</span></p>
<p><span>Do
not.</span> In a
dramatic majority of countries currently valid fiat money? What kind of money?<br/>
This worthless money but under duress State.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money</a></p>
<p>at a glance -&gt;
money that has no value in many places around the world but in his country has
a value of contractual because you need it to pay taxes, and others also have
to pay the taxes, so it is more or less probable<span>  that you will want someone in the future do
or sell something for the banknote or coin -&gt; eg. sell bread in the store</span></p>
<p>However, it has
several disadvantages especially when present in the open currency market:<br/>
- Fluctuations in the value resulting from market game play of the great
capitals<br/>
- Fluctuations resulting from economic crises<br/>
- Fluctuations resulting from economic attacks using a variety of instruments
such as political pressure. Lowering the rating of country to BBB<br/>
- Loss resulting from the mistakes of bankers, who will lead to the bankruptcy
of a bank or a stroke or lead to the edge of collapse of the bank - applies in
many countries even in Europe involuntary commitment of private money above EUR
100 000 if the bank is in need it may take private money.<br/>
- Loss as a result of assault<br/>
- Loss as a result of hacker intrusion to the bank<br/>
- A significant loss as a result of the destruction of the database containing
data about the status of your account<br/>
- Zero value in the case of a conventional war and the loss of territory<br/>
- Zero value in the case of a natural disaster<br/>
- Zero value in the event of bankruptcy of a State which is the issuer<br/>
- Almost zero value in the event of hyperinflation<br/>
- Decreasing value due to inflation<br/>
- Decreasing value as a result of the creation of money by private banks<br/>
- The contract price is closely linked to the issuer and its current situation
in the arena of geopolitics games which are complicated and uncertain<br/>
- There are significant fees for the abroad transfer of such money</p>
<p>As you can see money
that now apply to the general public, have to will face many challenges and
it's value is very vulnerable to attacks from different sides.</p>
<p>II) Does the solution
is Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies:</p>
<p>Hence the desire to
spread the mechanism that protects <span>significantly
or even preventing many of these activities.<br/>
The first such attempt - imperfect and solving only part of the problem was
Bitcoin.<br/>
It is a model to follow, but also had a few flaws.<br/>
The first and crucial: It was still fiat money and worthless in real.</span></p>
<p>The differences and
improvements in relation to Bitcoin will find a separate section.</p>
<p><span>III) The effective
solution:<br/>
1) Going one step further wanting to enter the market mechanism that protects
citizens from the greed and stupidity of many politicians, brokers and bankers.

</span></p><p><span>No fiat money </span></p>
<p>but token <span>of participation, which is all worth the same, have any
electronic representation or paper with
cover, in fact, in all kinds of goods that is completely something other than
banknotes, which are in the wallets of most Europeans, Asians, Americans and
Australians.</span></p>
<p>Token <span>of participation ? why token ? and in what participating ?</span></p>
<p>2 . Token because:</p>
<p>2.1. The management of
the token does not exclusively consist only of<span> 
cryptocurrency.<br/>
2.2. The portfolio contains the token representation can take three forms:
physical, electronic cryptocurrency and electronic registered wallets.<br/>
2.3. It is easy to transfer<br/>
2.4. Authorizes access to the system<br/>
2.5. They will be generated one-time password<br/>
2.6. This is not money. Why token of participation
is not money:<br/>
- There is no money creation or spontaneous creation of  tokens, with no cover in the goods<br/>
- The creation of token of participation is
associated with the payment in the accounting sense an adequate sum of money</span></p>
<p>3. Participation?<br/>
3.1 Yes, because these tokens of participation are proportional representation
values.<br/>
3.2 The values? Yes - but which one? Well, this is money that is paid before
the formation of the editing tokens are invested in accordance with the will of
the participants currently in production editing.<br/>
<br/>
3.3 Invested in what?<br/>
<br/>
Mainly in:<br/>
- Companies and projects around the world,<br/>
- Intellectual property like patents, databases, logos and brands, software,<br/>
- Also in raw materials with service of deposit.</p>
<p><span>While</span>, however, the token is in the form
of a token, do I have a direct interest in any of these companies? Only after
the life of edition you get directly some of the resources associated with
tokens and proportional to the number of tokens.

</p><p><b><span>3.4 Benefits. Why is this better than just having regular money wallet.</span></b></p><b>
</b><p><span>3.4.1
Earn. </span></p>
<p>You receive dividends
almost directly if you are a user of registered wallet, or if a mining of the
currency, and always when the investments are increasing and thus the value of
its assets increases.</p>
<p><br/>
More about that in the life cycle and in the statement of differences and
similarities due to Bitcoin. </p>
<p>3.4.2
Value

</p><p><span>Money have very
variable value, are exposed to all of the negative market factors as inflation,
the stock market crash, the game of big capitals, stock market gaming,
political pressure and blackmail in relation to a particular country.<br/>
<br/>
<span>3.4.3 All around the world:

</span></span></p><p>It is a global
currency. Investments are indeed are done locally and sometimes globally, but
you can pass it anywhere to anyone. Transfer of tokens abroad have no fees, in
general any transfer is almost no cost compared to conventional transfers or
operations using a credit card. In addition, the physical representation may
allow the transfer instantly when you are face to face.</p>
<p>3.4.4 Control:</p>
<p>Tokens <span>of participation BARNABITES COIN are under the control
of the users are not banks, state or an office.</span></p>
<p>3.4.5
Resistance and stability:

</p><p><span>Large capitals are
playing the value of one currency or currencies Bitcoin against or another,
tossing a lot of money from one currency to another in order to obtain income.
The effects of this game is bankrupt small businesses that could not or may not
be well protected against fluctuations in the prices of their goods and
services as a result of conversion, which takes place at long term agreements.</span></p>
<p>Stability, although
the market value of BARNABITES COIN change it and so it is backed with minimum
value<span>  in shares of companies and
investments in the basket associated with tokens of participation.</span></p>
<p>3.4.6
The protection of
ordinary people against perturbations <span>caused
artificially in the area<br/>
finance - currency war and other tricks to get more money from stock market
dirty games.</span></p>
<p>Is that a
revolution ? No, it is more like reinventing the wheel from medieval times. </p>
<p>When money
were money not just a thin air.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458482025/rbxkoraz676mgaqgxumz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

significant is that the tokens holders with registered wallets choose the
object of investment or the specialist which have to make investment in their
name. 
3 forms
have tokens - registered to personal details digital wallet, physical but cheap
and quite durable or electronic decentralized as cryptocurrency.
Value
proposition for customer: 
Easy
transferable even abroad but without many flaws of fiat money or strongly
protected against them. Flaws which are: inflation caused by money creation or
political games, stock market games, wars, local natural or economic disasters.

Build in
automated investment from savings.  
Who I am?
Software developer with economic, crypto technology and political education
and experience.
Why am I doing this project?
My life was very affected by the market gambling which generated 2009 crisis and I don`t want
any repeat of that in our future and future of our children. We don`t need to
wait for it as no legal changes are needed just our actions.
History and
background of project:
I) Is money - banknotes of which almost all people in the world are
using, have a real - minimal protected value?
Do
not. In a
dramatic majority of countries currently valid fiat money? What kind of money?
This worthless money but under duress State.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money
at a glance ->
money that has no value in many places around the world but in his country has
a value of contractual because you need it to pay taxes, and others also have
to pay the taxes, so it is more or less probable  that you will want someone in the future do
or sell something for the banknote or coin -> eg. sell bread in the store
However, it has
several disadvantages especially when present in the open currency market:
- Fluctuations in the value resulting from market game play of the great
capitals
- Fluctuations resulting from economic crises
- Fluctuations resulting from economic attacks using a variety of instruments
such as political pressure. Lowering the rating of country to BBB
- Loss resulting from the mistakes of bankers, who will lead to the bankruptcy
of a bank or a stroke or lead to the edge of collapse of the bank - applies in
many countries even in Europe involuntary commitment of private money above EUR
100 000 if the bank is in need it may take private money.
- Loss as a result of assault
- Loss as a result of hacker intrusion to the bank
- A significant loss as a result of the destruction of the database containing
data about the status of your account
- Zero value in the case of a conventional war and the loss of territory
- Zero value in the case of a natural disaster
- Zero value in the event of bankruptcy of a State which is the issuer
- Almost zero value in the event of hyperinflation
- Decreasing value due to inflation
- Decreasing value as a result of the creation of money by private banks
- The contract price is closely linked to the issuer and its current situation
in the arena of geopolitics games which are complicated and uncertain
- There are significant fees for the abroad transfer of such money
As you can see money
that now apply to the general public, have to will face many challenges and
it's value is very vulnerable to attacks from different sides.
II) Does the solution
is Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies:
Hence the desire to
spread the mechanism that protects significantly
or even preventing many of these activities.
The first such attempt - imperfect and solving only part of the problem was
Bitcoin.
It is a model to follow, but also had a few flaws.
The first and crucial: It was still fiat money and worthless in real.
The differences and
improvements in relation to Bitcoin will find a separate section.
III) The effective
solution:
1) Going one step further wanting to enter the market mechanism that protects
citizens from the greed and stupidity of many politicians, brokers and bankers.

No fiat money 
but token of participation, which is all worth the same, have any
electronic representation or paper with
cover, in fact, in all kinds of goods that is completely something other than
banknotes, which are in the wallets of most Europeans, Asians, Americans and
Australians.
Token of participation ? why token ? and in what participating ?
2 . Token because:
2.1. The management of
the token does not exclusively consist only of 
cryptocurrency.
2.2. The portfolio contains the token representation can take three forms:
physical, electronic cryptocurrency and electronic registered wallets.
2.3. It is easy to transfer
2.4. Authorizes access to the system
2.5. They will be generated one-time password
2.6. This is not money. Why token of participation
is not money:
- There is no money creation or spontaneous creation of  tokens, with no cover in the goods
- The creation of token of participation is
associated with the payment in the accounting sense an adequate sum of money
3. Participation?
3.1 Yes, because these tokens of participation are proportional representation
values.
3.2 The values? Yes - but which one? Well, this is money that is paid before
the formation of the editing tokens are invested in accordance with the will of
the participants currently in production editing.

3.3 Invested in what?

Mainly in:
- Companies and projects around the world,
- Intellectual property like patents, databases, logos and brands, software,
- Also in raw materials with service of deposit.
While, however, the token is in the form
of a token, do I have a direct interest in any of these companies? Only after
the life of edition you get directly some of the resources associated with
tokens and proportional to the number of tokens.

3.4 Benefits. Why is this better than just having regular money wallet.
3.4.1
Earn. 
You receive dividends
almost directly if you are a user of registered wallet, or if a mining of the
currency, and always when the investments are increasing and thus the value of
its assets increases.

More about that in the life cycle and in the statement of differences and
similarities due to Bitcoin. 
3.4.2
Value

Money have very
variable value, are exposed to all of the negative market factors as inflation,
the stock market crash, the game of big capitals, stock market gaming,
political pressure and blackmail in relation to a particular country.

3.4.3 All around the world:

It is a global
currency. Investments are indeed are done locally and sometimes globally, but
you can pass it anywhere to anyone. Transfer of tokens abroad have no fees, in
general any transfer is almost no cost compared to conventional transfers or
operations using a credit card. In addition, the physical representation may
allow the transfer instantly when you are face to face.
3.4.4 Control:
Tokens of participation BARNABITES COIN are under the control
of the users are not banks, state or an office.
3.4.5
Resistance and stability:

Large capitals are
playing the value of one currency or currencies Bitcoin against or another,
tossing a lot of money from one currency to another in order to obtain income.
The effects of this game is bankrupt small businesses that could not or may not
be well protected against fluctuations in the prices of their goods and
services as a result of conversion, which takes place at long term agreements.
Stability, although
the market value of BARNABITES COIN change it and so it is backed with minimum
value  in shares of companies and
investments in the basket associated with tokens of participation.
3.4.6
The protection of
ordinary people against perturbations caused
artificially in the area
finance - currency war and other tricks to get more money from stock market
dirty games.
Is that a
revolution ? No, it is more like reinventing the wheel from medieval times. 
When money
were money not just a thin air.

project and all support at searching for them.

to find out more about LGBT community life and see it with their own eyes.
That’s why we are eager to open such places as “Chrome” in other cities, first
of all in Kharkiv and Kirovograd.</p>
<p>In addition, “Chrome Space” has a
well-developed business scheme which will let us to follow market rules and
evolve the chain of LGBT open spaces. That is why we do need your help to

We ask for your
support in creating a cozy warm place where everyone will be able to find
something new and valuable despite his/her sexual orientation and gender
identity.

Our mission
   ""Chrome” is an open space for LGBT society and its friends. Unlike
numerous other LGBT organizations our goal is not about rights protection or
agitation but creating a safe area where tolerance of the team, friendly
atmosphere and creative leisure allow to realize the universality of human
values.  Thanks to aсtive involvement of
LGBT-friendly heterosexuals step by step we adjust differences between
LGBT-community and society as well as influence mutual problems solving.
                      

   
“Chrome” LGBT place is a small step towards our big dream which is to see the LGBT community as anessential part of new progressive and tolerant Ukrainian society.Despite the fact that Chrome exists only since 2012 we have managed to conquer thousands of hearts of people who are not indifferent to the LGBT community.Our path has begun from an online LGBT radio which allowed many activists and volunteers all over the country to illuminate the real state of LGBT rights in Ukraine. This project helped us to realize that people are eager to know not only abouttroubles and difficulties but also to hear the voices of sincere people and seethe happy future of the people equal to them.

                         

                                                          Remarkable events
On January 18, 2014,
the “Chrome space” for LGBT and LGBT-friendly people was opened and “Chrome
Vision” Youtube channel was created.

                         

In February 2014 we have developed our own
training session for those who are willing to understand themselves and their
partners. The “5 languages of love” training has become very popular not only
inside our community but also outside our city.

                          
On May 10, 2014, the
first official event of “Chrome Action” project was held. It was an active
adventure quest in the streets of our city.

                         


On February 1, 2016,
the “Chrome space” organization moves to a new place in the downtown and a
major reformation begins.

                            
Within 2 years “Chrome
Space” was visited by almost 2000 of people, including citizens of Russia,
Belorussia, Germany and Holland. Moreover, “Chrome Space” has been home for 7
visitors in-need for more than a month.

<p><b>#OutbidChang - A David vs Goliath mission. </b></p>
<p>Today,
there is only one remaining team in the biggest league in the biggest sport in
the world – Everton FC, a football team in the English Premier League, who
still has an alcohol brand on their jersey. Their sponsor is Chang beer, a brand
from a Thailand-based multinational corporation. They have a long-term
sponsorship deal with Everton FC, but this is being renegotiated after next
season. We want to replace Chang Beer with our local barbershop <i>The Barber Club</i>, located close to
Everton’s home stadium Goodison Park. And that’s where we need your help –
every penny counts and every cent takes us closer to our goal!</p>

<p><b>About us</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are a father and son owning a local barbershop in Bootle. Our shop, the Barber Club, is located near Everton’s home stadium Goodison Park.</p>Sean ‘the older’ is the owner of the
Barber Club, and Sean ‘the younger’ is a barber by profession. Both of us are
big Everton supporters and our family has been for generations. It would of
course be a dream come true to see our logo on the shirts of our favourite
team, especially when it could benefit a great cause and protect children from Big
Alcohol. 
<p>That’s why we are really happy to take part in this project from BigAlcohol.Exposed.   </p>

side effect – It doesn’t just make adults interested in a certain alcohol
brand, but children even more so. Children in
the UK today are actually more familiar with alcohol brands than they are with sweet
and cake brands. </p>

<p><b>Our expectations</b></p>
<p>Of course our

I told my story to the Italian magazine Donna Moderna.

Feel IT  is my new company, my baby.
It's an amazing journey through small Italian food producers and I will personally drive for kilometres to find the most authentic families that have been produced typical Italian recipes for generations, using LOCAL RAW MATERIALS only.
Are you a ""Curious Foddie"" or a "" Serial Foodie"" ? According to seasons and availability, every three months we will create a new ""box"" so  you will discover, a new Italian area tasting new organic or all-natural products that are not available in supermarkets.
For each area you will decide the size of your box, depending on which kind of Foodie you are!
HD videos, photos and interviews will let you feel my country before even taste products.
I believe in the power of ""taste test"", so our boxes will enable you to taste, smell and experience ingredients before ordering them through our online marketplace.
We're based near the famous Lake Como.

Humans can’t go it alone:</b></p><p>The size of data development – driven by the pace of data change – has come to the point where people basically can't deal with it without the guide of keen PCs, said Dr. Jim Hendler, chief of the Rensselaer Institute for Data Exploration and Application (IDEA), who drives the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute task to investigate new uses and bearings for AI innovation. In the short term, AI will figure out how to do things like reveal to us the online networking posts we'll discover all the more intriguing, be that as it may, in the more extended term, machines with AI capacities will offer clients a great deal more, said Dr. Yann LeCun, chief of AI examination at Facebook and the Silver teacher of software engineering at New York University. He offered situations including ""vision frameworks that can drive your auto, a vacuum cleaner robot that will perceive your furniture and if there's earth on the ground, an independent lawnmower that will cut your yard and not take out your blossoms."" Eventually, such innovation could upset commercial enterprises, for example, ground support, he said</p><p><b>2.

That is the manner by which Google researchers fabricated an AI framework in 2012 that began to carry on in the same route as a human web client—it started searching for feline features on YouTube, without being given any data about how to distinguish one. At the point when the researchers constructed a neural system of 16,000 PC processors with 1 billion associations and let it search 10 million irregular YouTube thumbnails more than three days, the framework learned naturally to search for and perceive pictures of felines, composes Liat Clark in Wired UK. The ​New York Times reported that this neural system ""performed far superior than any past exertion by generally multiplying its exactness in perceiving articles in a testing rundown of 20,000 particular things."" </p><ul>

Humans can’t go it alone:The size of data development – driven by the pace of data change – has come to the point where people basically can't deal with it without the guide of keen PCs, said Dr. Jim Hendler, chief of the Rensselaer Institute for Data Exploration and Application (IDEA), who drives the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute task to investigate new uses and bearings for AI innovation. In the short term, AI will figure out how to do things like reveal to us the online networking posts we'll discover all the more intriguing, be that as it may, in the more extended term, machines with AI capacities will offer clients a great deal more, said Dr. Yann LeCun, chief of AI examination at Facebook and the Silver teacher of software engineering at New York University. He offered situations including ""vision frameworks that can drive your auto, a vacuum cleaner robot that will perceive your furniture and if there's earth on the ground, an independent lawnmower that will cut your yard and not take out your blossoms."" Eventually, such innovation could upset commercial enterprises, for example, ground support, he said2. AI technology is becoming more usable:AI innovations, for example, neural systems, are starting to turn the corner and turn out to be more usable. That is the manner by which Google researchers fabricated an AI framework in 2012 that began to carry on in the same route as a human web client—it started searching for feline features on YouTube, without being given any data about how to distinguish one. At the point when the researchers constructed a neural system of 16,000 PC processors with 1 billion associations and let it search 10 million irregular YouTube thumbnails more than three days, the framework learned naturally to search for and perceive pictures of felines, composes Liat Clark in Wired UK. The ​New York Times reported that this neural system ""performed far superior than any past exertion by generally multiplying its exactness in perceiving articles in a testing rundown of 20,000 particular things.""
