We knew what we wanted and we knew we could improve on what choices were out there. We put our designers to work then rigorously tested the results. When we hit upon the UNO II design, we knew we had achieved what we wanted, a functional and essential day-pack for everyone.     You can easily organize your pack any way you want with UNO II, because it is designed with only ONE water-repellent fabric & one Zipper and can be opened easily and quickly. The other benefit for UNO II is that you won`t need to fumble into the bag to find the tiny things such as a key - just open it and you'll see everything inside.     Standard PanelEvery UNO II includes the incredibly useful work panel.          The standard panel is available for to both 20L and 30L sizes.                              UNO II is in 3 colors, and 2 sizes Sizes: 13.3'' (20L) and 15.6'' (30L)Colors: Charcoal (only for 30L), Grey (only for 20L), and Pink (only for 20L).",43.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Gravity One – The small lightweight external two axis gimbal rig</span><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>The Gravity One, G-1, is a two axis gimbal camera support. It’s built entirely in highest grade aluminium which makes it very light and extremly strong. The main purpose for the G-1 is to simplify camera handling when working with a body mount such as the Easyrig. It also simplifies handheld camera work and greatly reduces motion artefacts and unwanted motion in shots where the photographer is walking or running.</span><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/65110/files/20130910055823-GravityOne_only.jpg?1378817903"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We’ve been looking at a way of to overcome the shortcomings of the </span>preferred<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> way of shooting for many photographers, namely the ones that are using the Easyrig or the Walter Klassen suspender daily. The pendulum effect has always been a thorn in the side for photographers using these very popular body mounts. Now after a long period of design and r&amp;d we are happy to tell you that the Flowcine Gravity One aka G-1 has undergone its final changes, and we now have locked down the functionality of it in our latest prototype. It has now undergone some serious testing and the results are very promising.</span><br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Ergonomics and simplicity</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>Now, we know that the rigs based on helicopter gimbals with sensors and brushless motors are currently very popular. But for the G-1, we have taken a completely different route. We have have focused only on ergonomics first and foremost, with a open frame design that let the operator be as close to the camera as they are used too and still have superior versatility. Therefore it has been very important to make a solid rig, that can take almost any kind of camera weight and size and not limited it in terms of lens choices, balance or accessories.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Targeted at professional photographers</h3>
<p>While developing the G-1, we had professional photographers in mind. It’s a fully mechanic device, that will not let you down in any weather or terrain. Also the G-1 works well with gyros like the KS4x4 Kenyon for vehicle mount style shots, boat, aerial heli etc. mounted in a bungee cord.<br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The G-1 is mounted on the camera using a top plate, so Alexa users will have to have the Alexa handle unscrewed and an additional small mounting plate which we will provide for the Alexa. Also the camera can go from body rig to tripod with out having to remove the G-1 from the camera. Simply attach any kind of bridge plate directly underneath the camera since the G-1 is only mounted on top it wont be in the way and allow you to move easily on and off the tripod. You will also be able to use the Alexa shoulder pad with the G-1 without a problem. Sonys cameras up to F65 are of course also covered.</span></p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Gravity One features</span><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>G-1 is an very small lightweight external 2 axis Gimbal (pan axis is the EasyRig Cord).</li>
<li>It surrounds the camera externally in a very clever way so the operator can use the camera from shoulder to low mode.</li>
<li>It includes x/y positioning stages that enables you to perfectly balance the camera in 3 axis.</li>
<li>Its free float full bearing pivot supported gimbal in all crucial axis points.</li>
<li>It weights approx. 1800 grams and can fully support cameras up to 17 Kg or around 38 pounds.</li>
<li>It eliminates completely the pendulum effect created from the cord in all Easyrig style body mounts.</li>
<li>It allows the operator now to tilt freely with out effort +/- 60 degrees (that is approx. since there is always a little difference in camera height).</li>
<li>It allows the operator to freely roll the camera 30 degrees CCW, and 60 degrees CW.</li>
<li>Depending on the trim balancing tuning of the camera (perfect or a little bottom heavy) the camera will remain at all given tilting angles or rolling angles effortlessly, and the drag pendulum effect will completely be eliminated.</li>
<li>For moves being done without hands on camera, it produces very stable smooth footage, something that cannot be done without the G-1.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<h3>Extend your G-1</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Shortly after the initial launch of the G-1 we will offer the Gravity One Extended – G-1E: This is the most advanced version with sensor type Roll and Tilt gyro </span>stabilised<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> axis, and manual pan control. It includes a very small rocker joystick for tilt and/or roll control and be gyro stabilised at the same time while pan is controlled manually. We have further plans for the extended version, but we are taking it step-by-step and only add functionality that are something a professional photographer actually use every day. Please note that we are working with technology that allows us move up to around 15 kg camera total weight on the extended version! That means you can use any choice of lens/mattebox/camera and other accessories without giving you any worries. This version is designed to be mounted on almost any kind of body mount. The most exciting version though is the G-1 which will be released end of November.</span><br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And since its upgradable to the G-1E you can choose whenever you like to upgrade if you want to change your style of shooting, and go from all mechanical to a </span>motorised<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> version.</span></p>

<h3>Why crowd funding?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>So why did we decide to go on indiegogo and crowd fund the Gravity One? We have three good reasons:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The initial start up of the production of the G-1 is really costly. With your help we can get it started right away and ensure that everyone gets the lowest price possible!</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By securing funding, we can proceed with the next steps. The G-1E is already being worked on, but we got other little projects we want to be able to release as soon as possible. With your help we are sure we can bring this to the market faster.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We want to get in touch with our users. What camera you are using, what your </span>preferred<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> style of shooting is etc. During the </span>campaign<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> we want to run some surveys ensuring that everyone will be able to start shooting with their G-1 from the moment they unpack it.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While crowd funding is really great, and we hope to reach the campaign goal, it's important to know that even <b>if we don't reach our goal, all backers will get their Gravity Ones </b>anyway (and of course their T-shirts and stickers!).<br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We will start up the production even if it's just for one single G-1.</span></p>
<p></p>

<h3>Our perks</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The most interesting perk when backing us would obviously be the Gravity One itself. But if you're not ready to invest in one, you can back us by getting our awesome Flowcine T-shirt or maybe our stickers. And don't forget to spread the word, please share our campaign using the social media buttons at the top of the page!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>Your support is extremely important to us and we want to give back as much as possible. That's why the price range for the G-1 is between €1.920 and €2.200 for you backers. The estimated retail price will be €2.450, so you save a few hundred euros by supporting us early. You will, of course, also get your Gravity One before everyone else, so it's the best of two worlds!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why isn't shipping included in the price?</b></p>
<p>Shipping vary between locations and countries. We always try to find the best and cheapest shipping option for every backer. After the campaign is over we will contact you regarding shipping.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why do Swedish people have to add VAT?</b></p>
<p>Flowcine is a Swedish company. On products sold within Sweden you always have to pay VAT (25%), or ""moms"" as we say. Sorry about this.</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I really like your product and I want one, but I'm worried that you won't reach you goal. What happens to my money if you don't?</b></p>

The Gravity One, G-1, is a two axis gimbal camera support. It’s built entirely in highest grade aluminium which makes it very light and extremly strong. The main purpose for the G-1 is to simplify camera handling when working with a body mount such as the Easyrig. It also simplifies handheld camera work and greatly reduces motion artefacts and unwanted motion in shots where the photographer is walking or running.



Introduction

We’ve been looking at a way of to overcome the shortcomings of the preferred way of shooting for many photographers, namely the ones that are using the Easyrig or the Walter Klassen suspender daily. The pendulum effect has always been a thorn in the side for photographers using these very popular body mounts. Now after a long period of design and r&d we are happy to tell you that the Flowcine Gravity One aka G-1 has undergone its final changes, and we now have locked down the functionality of it in our latest prototype. It has now undergone some serious testing and the results are very promising.



Ergonomics and simplicity

Now, we know that the rigs based on helicopter gimbals with sensors and brushless motors are currently very popular. But for the G-1, we have taken a completely different route. We have have focused only on ergonomics first and foremost, with a open frame design that let the operator be as close to the camera as they are used too and still have superior versatility. Therefore it has been very important to make a solid rig, that can take almost any kind of camera weight and size and not limited it in terms of lens choices, balance or accessories.


Targeted at professional photographers
While developing the G-1, we had professional photographers in mind. It’s a fully mechanic device, that will not let you down in any weather or terrain. Also the G-1 works well with gyros like the KS4x4 Kenyon for vehicle mount style shots, boat, aerial heli etc. mounted in a bungee cord.The G-1 is mounted on the camera using a top plate, so Alexa users will have to have the Alexa handle unscrewed and an additional small mounting plate which we will provide for the Alexa. Also the camera can go from body rig to tripod with out having to remove the G-1 from the camera. Simply attach any kind of bridge plate directly underneath the camera since the G-1 is only mounted on top it wont be in the way and allow you to move easily on and off the tripod. You will also be able to use the Alexa shoulder pad with the G-1 without a problem. Sonys cameras up to F65 are of course also covered.















Gravity One features




G-1 is an very small lightweight external 2 axis Gimbal (pan axis is the EasyRig Cord).
It surrounds the camera externally in a very clever way so the operator can use the camera from shoulder to low mode.
It includes x/y positioning stages that enables you to perfectly balance the camera in 3 axis.
Its free float full bearing pivot supported gimbal in all crucial axis points.
It weights approx. 1800 grams and can fully support cameras up to 17 Kg or around 38 pounds.
It eliminates completely the pendulum effect created from the cord in all Easyrig style body mounts.
It allows the operator now to tilt freely with out effort +/- 60 degrees (that is approx. since there is always a little difference in camera height).
It allows the operator to freely roll the camera 30 degrees CCW, and 60 degrees CW.
Depending on the trim balancing tuning of the camera (perfect or a little bottom heavy) the camera will remain at all given tilting angles or rolling angles effortlessly, and the drag pendulum effect will completely be eliminated.
For moves being done without hands on camera, it produces very stable smooth footage, something that cannot be done without the G-1.



Extend your G-1

Shortly after the initial launch of the G-1 we will offer the Gravity One Extended – G-1E: This is the most advanced version with sensor type Roll and Tilt gyro stabilised axis, and manual pan control. It includes a very small rocker joystick for tilt and/or roll control and be gyro stabilised at the same time while pan is controlled manually. We have further plans for the extended version, but we are taking it step-by-step and only add functionality that are something a professional photographer actually use every day. Please note that we are working with technology that allows us move up to around 15 kg camera total weight on the extended version! That means you can use any choice of lens/mattebox/camera and other accessories without giving you any worries. This version is designed to be mounted on almost any kind of body mount. The most exciting version though is the G-1 which will be released end of November.And since its upgradable to the G-1E you can choose whenever you like to upgrade if you want to change your style of shooting, and go from all mechanical to a motorised version.
Pricing for the upgrade for our backers (Gravity One base rig not included):


G-1E brain including roll motor/sensor (100% stabilistation on roll):
1650 Euro


Additional axis (up to a total of three axis):
1000 Euro/axis


Wireless/Wired Joystick (User controlled tilt/pan etc.):
180 Euro


The prices above are for all of our backers here on the campaign. The retail prices will be around 40% higher, so make sure to reserve your G-1 now to ensure you get the low upgrade price once it's available.




Why crowd funding?

So why did we decide to go on indiegogo and crowd fund the Gravity One? We have three good reasons:



The initial start up of the production of the G-1 is really costly. With your help we can get it started right away and ensure that everyone gets the lowest price possible!


By securing funding, we can proceed with the next steps. The G-1E is already being worked on, but we got other little projects we want to be able to release as soon as possible. With your help we are sure we can bring this to the market faster.


We want to get in touch with our users. What camera you are using, what your preferred style of shooting is etc. During the campaign we want to run some surveys ensuring that everyone will be able to start shooting with their G-1 from the moment they unpack it.


While crowd funding is really great, and we hope to reach the campaign goal, it's important to know that even if we don't reach our goal, all backers will get their Gravity Ones anyway (and of course their T-shirts and stickers!).We will start up the production even if it's just for one single G-1.






Our perks


The most interesting perk when backing us would obviously be the Gravity One itself. But if you're not ready to invest in one, you can back us by getting our awesome Flowcine T-shirt or maybe our stickers. And don't forget to spread the word, please share our campaign using the social media buttons at the top of the page!

Pricing
Your support is extremely important to us and we want to give back as much as possible. That's why the price range for the G-1 is between €1.920 and €2.200 for you backers. The estimated retail price will be €2.450, so you save a few hundred euros by supporting us early. You will, of course, also get your Gravity One before everyone else, so it's the best of two worlds!



FAQ

Why isn't shipping included in the price?
Shipping vary between locations and countries. We always try to find the best and cheapest shipping option for every backer. After the campaign is over we will contact you regarding shipping.

Why do Swedish people have to add VAT?
Flowcine is a Swedish company. On products sold within Sweden you always have to pay VAT (25%), or ""moms"" as we say. Sorry about this.
I really like your product and I want one, but I'm worried that you won't reach you goal. What happens to my money if you don't?
While crowd funding is really great, and we hope to reach the campaign goal, it's important to know that even if we don't reach our goal, all backers will get their Gravity Ones anyway (and of course their T-shirts and stickers!). We will start up the production even if it's just for one single G-1.I have another question thats not listed above, what do I do?



Please email us at info@flowcine.com! We'd love to hear from you!

<p> Even after shooting lots of adventure videos, we hardly ever share them.<br/>In fact, we let the videos die on a hard drive and share selfies for even the most exciting experiences. </p>
<h4>That’s because most travelers and adventurers lack the skill and patience to edit videos. On top of that, they have to buy expensive cameras with even more expensive accessories.<br/>Something had to change.</h4>
<p>Frodo makes shooting videos easy and sharing them, even easier. Its Evolutionary Algorithm edits hours of adventure footage into ready-to-share videos instantly. With Frodo’s auto-editing, you’ll love to share videos with friends and family, as easily as you share selfies. What’s more, you can now say goodbye to numerous mounts and accessories because Frodo is super simple to strap-on anywhere and shoot with.</p>

<p>We at NexGear are a bunch of adventure enthusiasts. But when contained by four walls, we strive to create seamless wearable technology as engineers. That’s why Frodo holds a special place for all of us at NexGear, as it bridges our two passions - Adventure and Technology.</p>
<p>We observed that we were piling up videos on our hard drive, but not sharing any of them. At the same time, we were spending a lot on expensive mounts for expensive cameras. We knew something had to change and fortunately, our IIT Alumni background helped connect us to the right people. To chase the solution with a vision to revolutionise the way we share our adventure stories.</p>
<p>But getting a great team together wasn’t easy. In fact, we’ve been very lucky. Being part of a young start up based in Mumbai, it was important that we surrounded ourselves with a team who had a similar drive and passion, but at the same time, the expertise to back it up. </p>
<p>NexGear is led by our Co-Founder, Amardeep Singh - a pioneer in drone research and manufacturing in India who built India's first drone company, ideaForge. Out of which, the flagship product NETRA has been widely used for homeland security, border security, anti-terrorist operations and disaster management in India. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b style=""color:#ee593e;"">Why are we doing this?</b></p>
<p>Frodo is ready. The Intelligence is ready. All we need is your support to go into manufacturing. By gaining your support and backing through Indiegogo via pre-orders, we plan to manufacture Frodo on a large scale - reducing not just cost of production, but also the effective price of Frodo for the end consumer, you. As contributors and prospective backers, you have the power to help us make innovative technology affordable. So yes, every backer is special to us. </p>

<p><b>2.

That’s comparable to sport watches, but does a whole lot more even though it weighs less than a packet of chips. </span></p>
<p><b>3. What is the Battery Life of Frodo? <br/>What happens when the battery runs low? <br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Frodo can comfortably record 1.5 hours of Full HD footage. And before switching off, autosaves the on-going recording so you never lose your video.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Can I replace the battery?<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Frodo is designed to be waterproof without any casing, </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">but the battery by itself is not replaceable.

We have made sure the battery pack is designed that it can be mounted to any gear, so there are no interruptions to your adventure activity.</span></p>
<p><b>6. Do I need a connecting cable for Frodo? How long does it take to charge?<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">No. There is no hassle of cables at all as Frodo is <br/>wireless and works in a plug and play manner.

<p>Frodo is ready with a hardware manufacturing partner in place. But our team’s experience in creating innovative products has taught us that unforeseen delays can hit at any time. That’s why, after taking these external factors and advice of other experienced product innovators into consideration, we’re offering a conservative delivery date. Our aim is always to deliver a Frodo well in that time frame, but in case things happen beyond our control, we’ll make sure to keep you in the loop <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">and updated.</span></p>
<p>Creating Frodo has been one giant adventure. And as adventure enthusiasts, we take pride in moving away from the desk to make things happen. That’s why to ensure faster, timely and more efficient deliveries of Frodo, we’ll have a team stationed with our manufacturing partners.</p>
<p>When it comes to Frodo’s Intelligence, we’re at a stage where we can proudly share it with a Beta testing group of adventurers and travelers who can use the Frodo App, connect it to their regular action cameras, and give us valuable feedback. Our strong in-house App development team are always working on ways to enhance the auto-editing performance till the time we start shipping. So you’ll have an even more refined and the best possible Frodo delivered to you.</p>

Well, if you’ve read this far, we cannot thank you enough for showing an interest in what we’re doing.

</div></div>","Even after shooting lots of adventure videos, we hardly ever share them.In fact, we let the videos die on a hard drive and share selfies for even the most exciting experiences. 
That’s because most travelers and adventurers lack the skill and patience to edit videos. On top of that, they have to buy expensive cameras with even more expensive accessories.Something had to change.
Frodo makes shooting videos easy and sharing them, even easier. Its Evolutionary Algorithm edits hours of adventure footage into ready-to-share videos instantly. With Frodo’s auto-editing, you’ll love to share videos with friends and family, as easily as you share selfies. What’s more, you can now say goodbye to numerous mounts and accessories because Frodo is super simple to strap-on anywhere and shoot with.





 











Frodo's Facebook Live integration will make the world your audience. On hitting the stretch goal of $75,000, you will be able to broadcast your adventure from the Frodo App in real-time.
Press ‘Frodo Live’ on the Frodo App and share your adventure as it happens with your friends and family on Facebook. Not only that, your followers on Facebook will receive a push notification when you start streaming your ongoing adventure. So you'll never be far away from your friends as they can watch, comment and be a part of every adventure. 



















Action Cut
Parts of the footage which showed most activity on camera are intelligently shortlisted and stitched together in this style.





Calm Cut


Frodo intelligently picks out the calmer, slower, and more seemingly peaceful shots from the adventure footage.




















iOS + Android
Frodo isn’t just a camera. It’s a combination of hardware and software as it seamlessly syncs to your smartphone to deliver the magic of auto-editing through the Frodo app. So now you can edit videos instantly and on the go, without worrying about sitting for hours at an editing table ever again. The app is compatible with both iOS and Android phones.





























Who are we?
We at NexGear are a bunch of adventure enthusiasts. But when contained by four walls, we strive to create seamless wearable technology as engineers. That’s why Frodo holds a special place for all of us at NexGear, as it bridges our two passions - Adventure and Technology.
We observed that we were piling up videos on our hard drive, but not sharing any of them. At the same time, we were spending a lot on expensive mounts for expensive cameras. We knew something had to change and fortunately, our IIT Alumni background helped connect us to the right people. To chase the solution with a vision to revolutionise the way we share our adventure stories.
But getting a great team together wasn’t easy. In fact, we’ve been very lucky. Being part of a young start up based in Mumbai, it was important that we surrounded ourselves with a team who had a similar drive and passion, but at the same time, the expertise to back it up. 
NexGear is led by our Co-Founder, Amardeep Singh - a pioneer in drone research and manufacturing in India who built India's first drone company, ideaForge. Out of which, the flagship product NETRA has been widely used for homeland security, border security, anti-terrorist operations and disaster management in India. 

Why are we doing this?
Frodo is ready. The Intelligence is ready. All we need is your support to go into manufacturing. By gaining your support and backing through Indiegogo via pre-orders, we plan to manufacture Frodo on a large scale - reducing not just cost of production, but also the effective price of Frodo for the end consumer, you.

</p><p>My name is Lucas MacCormack, and I
am a 13 year old nature photographer/artist from Prince Edward Island, in Eastern
Canada. There are many advantages to being a thirteen year old nature
photographer; I get to go birding, I go
on walks in the woods almost every day, and I get to share my love and
knowledge of the natural world with people of all ages. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are disadvantages as
well; I am not old enough to have a job to make money for equipment, and I can't
enter my photos in most contests due to my age as well. I earned the money for my current camera and
lens through grass cutting and shoveling snow. I didn't expect that I would
outgrow my current lens as fast as I have.</p>
<p>I have been told that I have an unusual gift
for capturing that perfect moment with my photographs. Because I am a nature
artist I spend a lot of time learning
about the birds and other wildlife I photograph. I also frequently use the photos I
take to make original paintings and sketches. This campaign to raise funds for
a new lens would allow me to dive deeper into the world of nature photography.
The level of detail I desire for my photos cannot be reached with my current
camera gear. Having this new lens will allow me to show the world the beauty of
nature through my photography. </p>
<p> 
Nature gives us the chance to pause and reconnect.  By contributing to this campaign you can join
with me in bringing images of the natural world I love to more people. How we
see the natural world influences how we take care of it as well. I want to help
more people see the natural world through a new lens so we can all take better
care of nature. </p>
<p> 
The goal of this campaign is to raise $1500. I have saved almost $300 on
my own so far, but need your help to raise the rest of the funds. All of the
funds will go towards the purchase of a Sigma 150-600mm 5-6.3 DG HSM OS
Contemporary lens. This lens will give me the ability to photograph wildlife
with a minimal amount of disturbance on my part. Capturing birds and animals in
their natural, undisturbed state is the key component of really good nature
photography.  <br/></p><p>I really appreciate you taking the time to read this. I hope you will consider donating.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>-Lucas MacCormack<br/></p>

knowledge of the natural world with people of all ages. 
Unfortunately, there are disadvantages as
well; I am not old enough to have a job to make money for equipment, and I can't
enter my photos in most contests due to my age as well. I earned the money for my current camera and
lens through grass cutting and shoveling snow. I didn't expect that I would
outgrow my current lens as fast as I have.
I have been told that I have an unusual gift
for capturing that perfect moment with my photographs. Because I am a nature
artist I spend a lot of time learning
about the birds and other wildlife I photograph. I also frequently use the photos I
take to make original paintings and sketches. This campaign to raise funds for
a new lens would allow me to dive deeper into the world of nature photography.
The level of detail I desire for my photos cannot be reached with my current
camera gear. Having this new lens will allow me to show the world the beauty of
nature through my photography. 
 
Nature gives us the chance to pause and reconnect.  By contributing to this campaign you can join
with me in bringing images of the natural world I love to more people. How we
see the natural world influences how we take care of it as well. I want to help
more people see the natural world through a new lens so we can all take better
care of nature. 
 
The goal of this campaign is to raise $1500. I have saved almost $300 on
my own so far, but need your help to raise the rest of the funds. All of the
funds will go towards the purchase of a Sigma 150-600mm 5-6.3 DG HSM OS
Contemporary lens. This lens will give me the ability to photograph wildlife
with a minimal amount of disturbance on my part. Capturing birds and animals in
their natural, undisturbed state is the key component of really good nature
photography.  I really appreciate you taking the time to read this. I hope you will consider donating.Thank you.-Lucas MacCormack",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>       My name is Brian Evers and I am all-around photographer that specializes in nightlife, model portfolios, and still lifes.  I have been passionate about photography ever since my trip to Washington DC when I was 8.  My first memory of photography is asking for my father’s camera and running up to National Cathedral and laying down in front of it and looking straight up it to take a photograph.  This sparked a huge interest in photography that led to schooling and now living on my photography. </p>
<h2><strong>Unfortunately….</strong></h2>
<p><strong>         </strong>Three weeks ago at a photo shoot the unexpected happened.  The model was a friend this day and she was posing atop a table that seemed sturdy.  Unfortunately it only had one center leg so when the model stepped to the side she started to fall.  I was close so I reached out for her and caught her from falling and landing on the side of the table.  In doing so I had to abandon his camera.  This resulted in a broken lens, busted battery grip, and basically shattered flash.  Being a full time starving artist I have no way to replace all this expensive gear and therefore has no income.</p>
<h2><strong>Get back on my feet….</strong></h2>
<p><strong>         </strong>To get back on my feet and start making art and a living again I need to replace this equipment.  Here is a breakdown of the gear and costs….</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Canon BG-E6 Battery Grip                           $245</p>
<p>Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM Zoom Lens $2299</p>

<p>                                                Totaling $3098</p>
<h2><strong>How you can help….</strong></h2>
<p>         A donation of any size would help.  I will be able to start replacing gear and stop renting it every time.  I have future plans to travel the United States and shoot photo projects but need the gear!  A donation to my photography would show a love for the arts and starving artists out there everywhere.  If you can’t make a monetary donation a simple share on your social media site of this fundraiser is greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It is a delicate piece that beautifully explores the transition of letting something go, the something you have held onto, to stay numb instead of confronting the initial cause of pain and living again.</p>
<p>The idea and inspiration for the short came from our director's close friend Pol Guasch and his <u>Award Winning story</u> <i>Més o Menys</i> which won the award <strong>Joves.Lit 2015 by APELLC</strong>. Rubén, our Director, has worked closely with Pol adapting the work into a nostalgic screenplay. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget &amp; Breakdown</h3>
<p>The budget will be going towards all general costs of production and expenses such as travel, food, cast, etc. </p>
<p>We already have an amazing script and an eager team, for now a lot of our attention is on the Production Design, Art Department and securing the 2 remaining locations.</p>
<p>Production Design is one of the most important factors that is overlooked in student films and it is massively crucial to ours. We aspire to create a very stylised interior and detail is key. </p>
<p>** We need your help to make it happen! We hope you like the perks! **</p>
<p><strong>Take a chance to WIN a ticket and join us in London at the BFI (British Film Institute) NFT screening of our films in June by contributing with £35!!</strong> The NFT (National Film Theatre) is the BFI’s biggest auditorium!! It is a chance to meet professionals in the industry and you will get to see the <u>first screening of <i>Olivia</i></u> with us!!</p>

<p><strong><u>Director</u> - Rubén González</strong></p>
<p>I have a deep connection with this project, with Olivia I feel very personally attached. Developing this project has reminded me of my own experiences and for that reason I am putting every single part of myself into it to create something as sweet and beautiful as possible.</p>
<p>My passion is photography and art, I have directed some films before as well as doing cinematography and<i> Olivia</i> is something I have been determined to make into a film for a while so I am very excited to finally bringing it to life. Thank you so much for helping us to make <i>Olivia</i> possible, your contributions mean a lot to us, we’ll be always grateful.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
It is a delicate piece that beautifully explores the transition of letting something go, the something you have held onto, to stay numb instead of confronting the initial cause of pain and living again.
The idea and inspiration for the short came from our director's close friend Pol Guasch and his Award Winning story Més o Menys which won the award Joves.Lit 2015 by APELLC. Rubén, our Director, has worked closely with Pol adapting the work into a nostalgic screenplay. 
 

Budget & Breakdown
The budget will be going towards all general costs of production and expenses such as travel, food, cast, etc. 
We already have an amazing script and an eager team, for now a lot of our attention is on the Production Design, Art Department and securing the 2 remaining locations.
Production Design is one of the most important factors that is overlooked in student films and it is massively crucial to ours. We aspire to create a very stylised interior and detail is key. 
** We need your help to make it happen! We hope you like the perks! **
Take a chance to WIN a ticket and join us in London at the BFI (British Film Institute) NFT screening of our films in June by contributing with £35!! The NFT (National Film Theatre) is the BFI’s biggest auditorium!! It is a chance to meet professionals in the industry and you will get to see the first screening of Olivia with us!!
 
Our Team

Director - Rubén González
I have a deep connection with this project, with Olivia I feel very personally attached. Developing this project has reminded me of my own experiences and for that reason I am putting every single part of myself into it to create something as sweet and beautiful as possible.
My passion is photography and art, I have directed some films before as well as doing cinematography and Olivia is something I have been determined to make into a film for a while so I am very excited to finally bringing it to life. Thank you so much for helping us to make Olivia possible, your contributions mean a lot to us, we’ll be always grateful.

After 5 kick-ass campaigns, nearly $2 Million in funding, and successfully moving out of dad's basement (literally), we’re stoked to be back with our latest solution for commuters, creators, photographers, and travelers who want more out of their gear.  The DUO Daypack is a dawn-to-dusk, daily carrying beast that was tirelessly designed to go from work to play… to play to work… to work to work… to play to play… or whatever else you call your daily grinds, errands, and passions. WANDRD wasn’t born in a boardroom and it isn’t the brainchild of some serial entrepreneurs looking for the next “big thing”. No, WANDRD was born from two brothers who weren’t satisfied with the status quo. And while we've grown into a thriving team of passionate travelers, photographers, and creators (and a couple of smart asses), the same principles that founded our company run strongly through our veins.Our mission is simple: to inspire people to get out and live passionately; exploring, creating, and living life in the moment. We just happen to do that by creating the world’s best gear.Is there anything more frustrating than digging through every item you own just to find your headphones at the bottom your bag? Well, yes... actually... there are things that are much more frustrating. Like slow internet or kids sneezing directly into your open eyes. But it still sucks, right?With our radical, new InfiniteZip™ system, you get the opening of your choice – which means no more digging for what you need, no matter where it’s located. Our InfiniteZip™ system gives you quick, on-the-go access to what you needOur bags have won awards for their innovative functionality, and the DUO is no exception. We’ve invented a protection system that pops into place when needed, and just as easily pops out of the way when it’s not in use. Pretty neat, eh?The Pop Camera Cube — there when you need it, gone when you don't.The protective Pop Cube is a multifunctional space for a variety of tech and photography items. We have also included a padded EVA foam divider that can be adjusted to snuggly fit your camera, lenses, drone, shoes, or other gear.We've also built in dual padded expansion pockets, made out of a dense EVA foam. Perfect for small cameras, hard drives, lenses, and anything else that needs extra protection.  Don't let the sleek and minimal design of the DUO fool you, the inside is an organizational beast. Most bags turn into what we like to call a black hole, and finding your phone charger is like trying to keep track of a 5-year-old at Disneyland. But no more. With pockets, pouches, and organizers galore, you never have to wonder where your kid, I mean, phone charger is ever again. More pockets than your dad's favorite cargo shortsMost people tout quality, but few back it up with a no questions asked lifetime guarantee. And we can afford to do that because everything we do — from the materials we use to the way our bags are built – is the best of the best.  While we don’t recommend you taking a power washer to your bag, we did it for you in the name of science. And you know what? The DUO came out dry as a whistle. What does that even mean, ""dry as a whistle?"" Nobody knows, but it's provocative. But seriously, do you know who does know? The DUO does. Our dual airflow back panel is made of molded EVA foam with built in dual airflow channels for maximum breathability and comfort.The DUO is built out of a waterproof 840D Jr. Ballistic Nylon with a newly developed 5pm coating and weather resistant YKK zippers. Not only do they withstand the toughest of environments, but they're also damn sexy — kind of like Bear Grylls.Dual grab handles are made of nylon seatbelt webbing, making them soft to the touch, tough as nails, and comfortable to hold.",62.0,1,"7 Campaigns

THE STORY BEHIND DUDR</b><br/><br/>
<p></p>Stefan came back from his vacation - the Fifa World Cup in Brazil. He stayed there with his 3 DUDES in an apartment near Ipanema-Beach.

<p><span>I have spent the past two years studying and working for funding to photograph elephant conservation efforts in Kenya. I have been a Fulbright finalist twice and thanks to the NGYE grant and your help I will finally be able to make my dreams a reality. I spent last summer learning all that I possibly could about honey bees, being mentored by Chicago beekeepers, and zoologists. In addition I have undergone 6 months of Immunotherapy in order to build up my immunity and fight off my allergy to honey bees. I have spent months studying Swahili through the Swahili Institute of Chicago. My drive and passion for this project might be what some people consider a little crazy. But supporting this cause is worth the time and effort its taken to get here. </span></p>

</div></div>","My name is Jessica Van Fleteren and I was recently awarded a National Geographic Young Explorers grant. In April of 2016, I will be traveling to Kenya to partner with Save the Elephants affiliated organization Elephants and Bees. I will be documenting the use of African Bee hives as a mitigation technique in the human-elephant conflict and helping with monitoring their bee hive projects. 
 

Placing beehives along wire fences around the circumference of crops helps to create a needed barrier between farmland and hungry elephants.


Using Audio playback recordings Dr. Lucy King of Elephants and Bees has found that African Elephants are extremely fearful of Africanized honey bees. 
Elephants will emit a low rumble when they hear bees buzzing to notify the herd of potential danger.
Driving elephants away will protect both farmers and elephants.




As an explorer my main goal is to document this incredible process in order to spread awareness through photography and digital media. In addition to photographing my surroundings during my time in Kenya I will also be learning about camera traps, helping monitor beehives, help extract honey and support conservation education in the local village. After the completion of this project I will be focusing on continual grant support to work with human-wildlife conflicts and working towards conservation education initiatives.




For more information on Elephants and Bees amazing work watch the following video produced by Disney:  















I have spent the past two years studying and working for funding to photograph elephant conservation efforts in Kenya. I have been a Fulbright finalist twice and thanks to the NGYE grant and your help I will finally be able to make my dreams a reality. I spent last summer learning all that I possibly could about honey bees, being mentored by Chicago beekeepers, and zoologists. In addition I have undergone 6 months of Immunotherapy in order to build up my immunity and fight off my allergy to honey bees. I have spent months studying Swahili through the Swahili Institute of Chicago. My drive and passion for this project might be what some people consider a little crazy. But supporting this cause is worth the time and effort its taken to get here. 
 


While NGYE grant is covering my living costs while in Kenya (housing, meals, some gear needed for exploration, research costs associated with working with Elephants and Bees) I need to raise $7855.00 in additional funding in order to complete this project safely and effectively . If I do not reach my goal I will still keep the amount of funds raised but Indiegogo will take a larger percent from my total fundraised; the percent is less if I reach my goal. This campaign will help me cover the following cost:


Housing - CoveredFood - Covered Flight - $1300.00Camera Gear - $1700.00Sound Gear - $380.00Media Management - $1050.00Heath Insurance - $600.00Transportation in country - $1200.00Supplies - $480.00BeeKeeping Gear  -$345.00  (Will be donated to the program upon completion)Visa & Passport - $200.00Immunization Upkeep - $400.00Cellphone and Internet - $200.00Total $7855.00





A lot. From health and beauty products to gourmet chocolate, honey, gifts from Kenya, handmade artist handcrafted products and so much more. Check out the ""Gallery"" page for more photos ! 









I realize some people may not be able to help fund JV And The Bees. That doesn't mean you still can't help. It would be just as helpful to share this project with friends or family.

<p>As promised, here are some pics of the final prototype. As you can see, there are many, many improvements over the original prototype:</p>
<p>- overall finish is of much higher quality</p>
<p>- nice rubber hand grip</p>
<p>- longer (more stable) stabilizer arm</p>
<p>- smaller, neater thumb screws</p>
<p>- high quality brass thumb nuts</p>
<p>- much more adjustments to balance a wider range of cameras</p>
<p>- thin anti-slip rubber padding instead of felt padding</p>
<p>- and many more details ...</p>

<p>Some good news finally! I have finally found a shop that seems to be able to deliver. They have provided me 2 samples, for testing, of the aluminum frame that they produced according to the design I gave them. I have assembled a unit and it seems perfectly good.</p>
<p>I have also received all the other parts necessary to complete assembly of the stabilizers. This is a lot of hardware.</p>
<p>I'll post pictures of it all in the next few days for your viewing pleasure!</p>

<p>Ok, this is going to sound ridiculous, but the 2nd machine shop did not complete the work and doesn't even want to send me the unfinished parts so that I can hand them over to another shop to finish.<br/><br/>So, I'm back to square one. This is turning out to be ridiculously complicated for no reason.<br/><br/>I want you guys to know that I'm still not giving up on this. You WILL get your stabilizer. When? I'd love to be able to give an answer to that question, but as you noticed, it is impossible at the moment!<br/><br/>So, again, I apologize for the delay, but rest assured that I will deliver!</p>

<p style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Hello funders!<br/><br/>Here's an update on the status of the project.<br/><br/>After completing the manufacturing of the stabilizer, we noticed a defect. The aluminum frame had cracks at the bends, which could compromise its strength. The cracks were not visible until the frames had been anodized.<br/><br/>I did not want to ship a sub-par products so we are having all the stabilizers re-manufactured from scratch using a different grade of aluminum.<br/><br/>The machine shop I'm working with is kind enough to put a rush on this project. So the waiting shouldn't be as long as for the first try.<br/><br/>I sincerely apologize for the delay. And I hope you can understand that there can be complications and unexpected delays with a start-up company like mine.<br/><br/>Thank you for your understanding.</span></p>

The GUERRICAM Camera Stabilizer is a device to which you mount a camera that enables fluid handheld shots. Watch the video to see what it is capable off.<br/><br/>The Stabilizer was designed to work with most DSLR cameras and consumer camcorders. It is optimized for DSLRs such as the Canon 5D Mk2, the T2i, the Nikon D3000, or the D7000, and it is also compatible with handheld camcorders. With some creativity you can also mount ultra-lightweight cameras like the GoPro. We're working on an adapter to make this very simple.<br/><br/><h3 style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">How different from the Prototype will the Production Stabilizer be?</span></h3>
The Stabilizer you see in the demo video is the Prototype I built myself with limited tools. The production Stabilizer will be professionally manufactured.

<h3 style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">What makes the GUERRICAM Stabilizer so cool?</span></h3>
With a camera stabilizer you will be able to produce smooth, fluid shots that are impossible to achieve handheld.

The Stabilizer is very easy to figure out. Simply attach your camera or camcorder like you would on a tripod. Then balance the stabilizer with the weights included. And that's it, you can start recording right away!<br/><br/><h3><strong><span style=""color: #000000; font-size: large;"">Will there be future GUERRICAM products?</span><br/></strong></h3>
You know it! I had a lot of fun designing the Stabilizer. I'm also very happy I was able to achieve this design with such a low-cost which allows practically anyone to gear up, even on the smallest budgets. I want to continue in this direction and offer a wide range of gear for guerrilla filmmakers who can't afford the more expensive stuff. I have already started developing a low-cost slider and a low-cost rig.

<p>Indeed! There are many other ways you can help. The most important is to spread the word about this campaign. You can do so be sharing the link to this campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, Google+.

You can also invite your friends to ""Like"" our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/guerricam"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Facebook Page</a>, follow us on <a href=""http://twitter.com/guerricam"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Twitter</a>.

</div></div>","UPDATE (2012-09-19):
Finally, the aluminum frames are here! I have started assembly of the Guerricam stabilizers and I will begin shipping them out very soon (by the end of the week). Here are a few pictures of the final production unit before assembly:
 

 

 

 

UPDATE (2012-06-26):
As promised, here are some pics of the final prototype. As you can see, there are many, many improvements over the original prototype:
- overall finish is of much higher quality
- nice rubber hand grip
- longer (more stable) stabilizer arm
- smaller, neater thumb screws
- high quality brass thumb nuts
- much more adjustments to balance a wider range of cameras
- thin anti-slip rubber padding instead of felt padding
- and many more details ...

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
And all the parts required to assemble the stabilizers. All that is missing are the stabilizer arms.
 

 

 

 

 

 

UPDATE (2012-06-21):
Some good news finally! I have finally found a shop that seems to be able to deliver. They have provided me 2 samples, for testing, of the aluminum frame that they produced according to the design I gave them. I have assembled a unit and it seems perfectly good.
I have also received all the other parts necessary to complete assembly of the stabilizers. This is a lot of hardware.
I'll post pictures of it all in the next few days for your viewing pleasure!
If everything goes well, I should be shipping out the stabilizers starting mid-July.
 

UPDATE (2012-05-08):
Ok, this is going to sound ridiculous, but the 2nd machine shop did not complete the work and doesn't even want to send me the unfinished parts so that I can hand them over to another shop to finish.So, I'm back to square one. This is turning out to be ridiculously complicated for no reason.I want you guys to know that I'm still not giving up on this. You WILL get your stabilizer. When? I'd love to be able to give an answer to that question, but as you noticed, it is impossible at the moment!So, again, I apologize for the delay, but rest assured that I will deliver!
 

UPDATE (2012-01-25):
Hello funders!Here's an update on the status of the project.After completing the manufacturing of the stabilizer, we noticed a defect. The aluminum frame had cracks at the bends, which could compromise its strength. The cracks were not visible until the frames had been anodized.I did not want to ship a sub-par products so we are having all the stabilizers re-manufactured from scratch using a different grade of aluminum.The machine shop I'm working with is kind enough to put a rush on this project. So the waiting shouldn't be as long as for the first try.I sincerely apologize for the delay. And I hope you can understand that there can be complications and unexpected delays with a start-up company like mine.Thank you for your understanding.
 
IF YOU MISSED THE CAMPAIGN BUT STILL WANT TO BUY ONE, THE GUERRICAM CAMERA STABILIZER WILL BE FOR SALE SOON. AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE POSTED ABOUT IT.
-------

UPDATE (2011-11-21): The campaign is now over! Thanks everyone for the support! The first batch is currently in production and will be ready in about 2-3 weeks. The first stabilizers will start shipping out a few days later.

-------

UPDATE (2011-11-14): Only 5 days left! The first 25 stabilizers are all spoken for. And there are already 9/35 of the $35 stabilizers gone. Also, a bunch of local filmmakers have arranged to pay me directly. This was enough to convince me to go ahead and order the first batch of 100 stabilizers. THE FIRST BATCH SHOULD BE READY IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS!!!


If you're a member on a forum (filmmaking-related or not), it would be great if you could start a thread about this campaign. If you're on Twitter, please write a quick tweet like: Why DIY when you can buy it so cheap? $35 Camera Stabilizer! http://igg.me/p/45439


To everyone that already paid for a stabilizer, or anyone that helped spread the word in any way: thank you so much for your support guys! 

PS: If you forgot to pay for the shipping fees, please do so ASAP! To do this, select the ""Other Amount"" contribution, enter the appropriate amount ($12 for Canada, $15 for USA, $20 International), and click the ""CONTRIBUTE NOW"" button.
-------

UPDATE (2011-11-02): Already half-way through the campaign! 18 of the first 25 stabilizers are already spoken for. Also, a bunch of local guys are excited about this and have arranged to pay me directly. So, that leaves a few more spots at the $25 price point.

Also, I have made a short video showcasing the capabilities of the stabilizer. I have made it the main video for this campaign. The old video is still available here: http://vimeo.com/30698113
Next up is a video showing exactly how the stabilizer works with different kind of cameras (DSLR, Point-and-Shoot, etc...). I'll show you how to balance the stabilizer and maybe a few tips on how to use it, but I'm still very new at this, so we'll see!

Finally, we need to make even more noise! If you're a member on a forum (filmmaking-related or not), it would be great if you could start a thread about this campaign. If you're on Twitter, please write a quick tweet like: Why DIY when you can buy it so cheap? $25 Camera Stabilizer! http://igg.me/p/45439


Again, to everyone that already paid for a stabilizer, or anyone that helped spread the word in any way: thank you so much for your support guys! 

-------

UPDATE (2011-10-26): We're already a little more than 1 week into the campaign! 10 of the first 25 stabilizers are already spoken for. That's a great start :D Thank you so much for your support guys! A few blogs are talking about this campaign (NextWaveDV, FishXpressions, and Video For Real Estate). The word is also starting to spread on Twitter and Facebook. 

But we need to make even more noise! If you're on Twitter, please write a quick tweet like ""Help make it happen for the $25 Camera Stabilizer! http://igg.me/p/45439"". If you're a member on a forum (video-related or not), it would be great if you could start a thread about this campaign.
Finally, I'm working on a new video to better showoff the performance of the stabilizer. And also, to show exactly how it works with a DSLR mounted and balanced.
-------

Thanks for checking out my IndieGoGo project! Watch the video, become a backer and spread the word! Message me on Twitter or Facebook if you have any feedback or questions. Thanks!

What is the GUERRICAM Camera Stabilizer?
The GUERRICAM Camera Stabilizer is a device to which you mount a camera that enables fluid handheld shots. Watch the video to see what it is capable off.The Stabilizer was designed to work with most DSLR cameras and consumer camcorders. It is optimized for DSLRs such as the Canon 5D Mk2, the T2i, the Nikon D3000, or the D7000, and it is also compatible with handheld camcorders. With some creativity you can also mount ultra-lightweight cameras like the GoPro.

I started a blog in 2012 March named ""Pictures from an organic chemistry laboratory"" where I publish a new picture every day from the lab. The pictures are mainly from the reactions, compounds what I have made during my scientific research and I usually add some info from them e.g.: why not to breathe  hydrogen cyanide. So far I have submitted more than a thousand posts with more than 1200 pictures during the years and the blog has got ten thousands of followers for now. 
Why I'm asking for your help?
My current camera (Nikon D5000) is almost dying. I've made 90.000 photographs, and I can't buy new. The shutter in the Nikon D5000 body is rated to 100.000 shots, so my camera and with this, the blog is also near to it's end. With your help I would like to buy a new camera body what is also capable for taking high quality videos and helps me to continue photographing chemistry.
How can you help?1. Share the IndieGoGo page on Facebook & Twitter: http://igg.me/at/labphotographer1 2. Just visit the blog or share it somewhere: labphoto.tumblr.com3.

<p>Dear everybody,</p>
<p>My name is Max Gyselinck, I am a Belgian freelance photographer based in Athens, Greece since 2002. My work mainly focuses on social and political issues, from the Greek economic crisis and its consequences to the Mediterranean refugee issue. I’ve been published and collaborating on assignments with numerous international newspapers and magazines such as Le Monde, Le Soir, l'Obs, Land, Le Figaro, Causette, Le Parisien, l'Internazionale, The Guardian among others.</p>
<p>As some of you already know, my beloved camera Canon EOS 5D mk2 got stolen on Friday, 15<sup>th</sup> of July, in the center of Athens as I was taking pictures of the Athens’s town hall coloured by the French flag in tribute to the recent attack in Nice, Southern France. Attached to the camera was a Canon EF 24-105 f/4L IS USM lens.</p>
<p>This camera followed me everywhere in Greece and abroad, helped me to capture the post-war in Georgia and Lebanon, the Srebrenica’s massacre commemorations till the economic and refugee crisis in Greece and its consequences.</p>
<p>As a freelance photographer, I can’t afford buying new equipment, especially in these difficult economic times in Greece and throughout Europe, photographers’ incomes are getting lower &amp; lower, newspapers and magazines pay for publications with delay, clients ask for competitive and very low rates that make it sometimes difficult to even cover the basic cost of living.</p>
<p>Freelance photographers don’t depend on any organization or agencies susceptible to cover stolen or damaged camera expenses.</p>
<p><strong><u>Goals</u></strong></p>
<p>I need to raise 3000 EUR to cover the cost of my stolen equipment, the camera body and the lens that was attached on it.</p>
<p><strong><u>What you’ll get</u></strong></p>
<p>Donators will receive a range of visual goodies, depending on their donation,including high quality prints up to 30x40, printed postcards, portrait sessions and photography lessons for those based in Athens.</p>
<p><strong><u>Other ways to help</u></strong></p>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute financially, which is completely understandable, you still can support me by sharing the campaign with your friends and relatives which is also a major help! Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Be certain to use the IndieGoGo share tools. It’s the easiest way to pass the word along.</p>

I started taking the good camera I bought to capture the precious moments of my kids growing up to the shows with me. Turned out to be good at capturing the bands I love and the new friends I make all the time and saving these moments forever. I also share these moments that I captured with everyone so we can all enjoy and remember what a great time that show was. Well...... on Friday the 13, the image sensor went out on the camera and I managed to tear up the lens gears trying to get it to work. Only got 2 pictures that night before the show even started. Went to 5 shows that weekend and everyone was asking where my camera was. I was lost without it and felt like I was not doing my part for the metal community that I am proud to be a part of. I had that one for 8 years, so there is no warranty left and repair costs are close to the cost of a newer model camera. I am going to stick with the same series of camera as it is the best pocket camera I can get into any show with and not need a press pass to use. There were several musicians that mentioned having a benefit show or starting a fundraiser so I can replace my camera and continue to capture amazing images of my friends and the wonderful bands some of them are in, as well as the national acts that come through. Of course I will continue to share all of these with every one of you. I try never to ask for money from people and you all know I would do absolutely anything I can for any of you if I am able. Since the divorce and foreclosures, I just have no extra money at all and I am just barely getting by and proving for my kids. There are 2 different cameras in this series that I am looking at. The 1st will come out in a couple of weeks and has a newer processor that will be better at the low light shots and it has a newer image sensor than my last one, so that problem will not happen again. The 2nd one is last years model, but the image sensor is 3 times the size of the 1st one. The processor in that one is also last years, so it is not as fast as the new one. But with it being 3 times bigger, it has it's own advantages. With that size comes a cost though. The 1st one is about $600 and the 2nd one is about $800. I have set my goal at $900 to cover fees on here and shipping and tax or anything else that comes up.</span></font></h3></span></span></span></span></div>","Everyone knows I love taking pictures at all the shows I go to.

I owned that camera for 4 years and only then I could afford to buy myself a 12 megapixel ""bridge"" camera from my scholarship. It was way more professional than my older cameras were, with manually adjustable shutter speed and aperture values but yet still not enough to let me do what I really want to do due to the lens distortion and point-and-shoot limiations. I feel literally blocked from many of the possibilities caused by my narrow hardware and that also lowers my enthusiasm. People love my work and some of them would like me to make portfolios of them but with my current camera it is just not as good as it gets.

</p><h1>I'am excited, tell me more! </h1><p>MIOPS is a standalone, small factor device which can trigger 
your camera or flash unit. It has three different sensors; light, sound 
and laser. MIOPS uses these sensors to detect external events such as 
lightning, fireworks, popping balloon or a laser beam cut by an 
obstacle, just to name a few. When such an event is detected, it 
triggers your camera or flash unit. MIOPS has an input port where you 
can hook up external sensors as well. You can for example hook up a 
pressure sensor and use the pressure as a triggering event. It is 
possible to program MIOPS so that it will take a picture whenever 
someone steps on your door mat. You just need to place a pressure sensor
 under the mat and connect it to MIOPS. There are so many different 
sensors out there and this means you have unlimited options as well to 
demonstrate your creativity with MIOPS.</p><p>MIOPS is not bigger than a
 credit card and only less than an inch in thickness. It is also light 
weight and consumes very little space in your camera bag. This is 
especially important if you carry your other heavy equipment in your 
bag. MIOPS has a colourful LCD screen and easy to use interface. You can
 configure your device using the on-board buttons and the screen. It 
gets even easier if you do this over your smart-phone. MIOPS has 
Bluetooth capability and with its dedicated smart-phone application you 
can configure MIOPS without even touching it. All of the device settings
 are also available on the application. On top of the basic modes and 
settings, the smart-phone application offers other features like cable 
release modes and scenario processing mode where you can define event 
scenarios using the combination of the different sensors. You can for 
example create a custom scenario like this: <i>I want the sound mode to be activated after the sunset</i>.
 You configure this using the application and the scenario is sent to 
MIOPS over Bluetooth connection. Afterwards, you can take your phone and
 go away, MIOPS will take care of the rest. It does not need the 
smart-phone to be close by to operate. You can store the scenarios in 
the application and reuse them whenever you want. You can store up to 
three scenarios and each of them can check against up two five different
 conditions measured by all of the sensors. MIOPS is Bluetooth 4.0 
compatible, so it is energy efficient, has great coverage and is 
compatible with iOS and Android smart-phones with Bluetooth 4.0.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806387/files/20140823051324-f9d6c9f3c1ac93affe49169bb3195dea_large.JPG?1408796004"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>A mini-USB port has been added to MIOPS and it serves two important 
purposes. First of all, you can charge your MIOPS over this USB 
connection. You can also use a compatible USB charger or you can even 
charge it in your car just as you charge your cell phone. The 
rechargeable battery of MIOPS will last for days, it has energy saving 
features so you don't have to charge your battery very often. The second
 purpose it serves is the firmware upgrade. MIOPS will have an 
upgradeable firmware, so you can have new features with the release of 
new firmware. You will be able to download the new firmware and upgrade 
your MIOPS within a few minutes.</p><p>High speed photography can be 
tricky sometimes. In some cases, you will need to trigger your flash 
unit, not your camera. In order to cover this, MIOPS has two dedicated 
outputs, one is for the camera and the other one is for the flash unit. 
You can use them separately or at the same time. They are electrically 
isolated from each other, so there is no risk of a short circuit. Also, 
each output isolates MIOPS from your camera or flash unit optically. 
This means in fact there is no electrical connection between your camera
 and MIOPS at all. One end of the connection cable goes to the remote 
shutter release port of your camera and the other ends goes to MIOPS. 
The cables are exchangeable, you can use your MIOPS with different 
cameras. You don't need to buy an extra unit for your second camera. 
MIOPS is compatible with most of the major makes and models. You just 
need to get the proper cable for your other camera. The interface of the
 cable connection is a standard 2,5 mm jack. Extension cables are 
commonly available in the market if you have a different setup in your 
mind where the camera has to stay far away from MIOPS. The same is also 
valid for the flash unit connection. It uses the standard 3,5 mm 
connection. Some DSLR cameras do not have a remote shutter release port,
 instead of this they can be triggered with an IR remote controller. If 
you own such a camera, you are also covered. MIOPS can trigger your 
camera with IR connection as well.</p><h1>Which Operation Modes Does MIOPS Have? </h1><p>MIOPS is a high-speed camera trigger with multiple modes 
combined in a single box with all built-in sensors. In order to use the 
available modes of MIOPS, you don't need to add anything else. 
Everything is already in the unit and ready to use. Switching between 
different modes is just a matter of a few clicks and it happens in 
seconds. It has basically six different modes, let's see them all.</p><p><b>LIGHTNING</b></p><p>Even
 this mode is called lightning, there is actually so much more about it.
 Lightning is only one of the events that MIOPS can detect with its 
light sensor. When the lightning strikes, MIOPS detects in a few 
nanoseconds and triggers your camera. There is virtually no delay other 
than the lag time of the camera. MIOPS is well fast enough to capture 
bolts which stay visible for about 100 milliseconds. You don't need to 
keep your finger on the shutter release button without knowing when it 
is going to strike again. MIOPS will detect it and it will help you take
 the perfect picture. You can adjust the sensitivity of MIOPS in this 
mode. If you want to capture the biggest bolts only, you can set it to 
low sensitivity. If you set it to a high level sensitivity, it will even
 detect the smallest strikes which are usually not noticed by human eye.
 Fireworks is another great event to capture using MIOPS. The idea is 
the same with lightning strikes. You can maybe come up with other light 
events to be captured with MIOPS, we have only named two of them. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806392/files/20140823051459-6e3058d8fab81a92e878b3365d821a8f_large.jpg?1408796099"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic;"">Special thanks to Bryan Snider for taking this great photo for us!</span></p><p>
</p><p><b>LASER</b></p><p>MIOPS can detect laser beams as well and they make
 the detection of so many events possible. The idea is very simple. If 
the laser beam is broken, then there must be something happened. And 
most of the time something happens in milliseconds, but it is not a big 
deal for MIOPS. The laser beam is so thin, even a water drop can break 
it. This is how MIOPS detects that the water drop is falling down and 
then it triggers the camera at the perfect time. This is almost 
impossible to do with human reflexes. Laser mode can also be used to 
detect the presence of people, animals or anything bigger than a water 
drop. This means you detect almost anything. One of the most common uses
 would be a photo trap. You know a wild animal is in the area and you 
want to take a picture of it. You never know when it will be coming 
back, but you don't need to. You can set up a laser source and MIOPS so 
that the laser beam will be broken when the animal walks through the 
beam and MIOPS will trigger the camera at that moment, or better said 
whenever you want it to be triggered. You can add some delay to the 
process. MIOPS can also turn your camera into a surveillance device. If 
an intruder breaks the beam, MIOPS will trigger your camera and you will
 have a picture on the intruder. Have a look at the following bullet!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806398/files/20140823051725-06030e33e6899586719430d365e6fca9_large.jpg?1408796245"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic;"">Is it too fast? MIOPS doesn't think so!</span></p><p><b>SOUND</b></p><p>When it is all about high-speed photography, sound
 mode is the mode where things get serious. This is the essential mode 
to take high-speed pictures in a controlled studio environment. Even 
MIOPS is fast enough to take pictures of bullets or arrows, your camera 
is not that fast. Average DSLR camera has a lag time of about 50 
milliseconds. This is too long if your objects fly by in a few 
milliseconds. The sound mode of MIOPS does the trick. You prepare your 
setup in a completely dark room and bring your camera into bulb mode. As
 it is completely dark, the camera will not capture anything. What is 
needed? Light. What delivers the light in a dark room? A flash unit. 
This is why MIOPS triggers your flash unit instead of your camera. The 
built-in microphone of MIOPS detects the sound event and triggers the 
flash unit. When the flash unit is fired, the camera will capture a 
single frame. This is how you can eliminate the lag time of the camera 
and capture a real high-speed picture of the object. The main parameter 
of sound mode is the delay. Delay is the duration starting from the 
sound event until the flying object gets there where you want it to be. 
Using the application or the device menu of MIOPS, you can set any delay
 between 0 ms up to 999 ms. You can also adjust the sensitivity of sound
 mode. It will allow you to tweak your setup per your creativity. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806405/files/20140823052038-9f0a2cab9d7f16cc33f0425664b63e82_large.jpg?1408796438"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic;"">It is not a bottle anymore :)</span></p><p></p><p><b>TIMELAPSE</b></p><p>When it comes to MIOPS, it is not just 
sensors. In timelapse mode, MIOPS does not use any sensors but it 
benefits from the electronics and software to take sequential pictures 
within a time period with equal time difference between each of them. 
You can also specify the exposure of the pictures just per your wish. 
After you have adjusted your parameters, MIOPS will take care of the 
rest. You can do the adjustment on MIOPS itself or you can also use the 
smartphone application to configure MIOPS. You can set the interval 
anywhere between one second and an hour. As MIOPS has energy saving 
features like turning the LCD off, you can shoot timelapse photography 
for days without recharging. If you can supply MIOPS with an external 
power source, you can expect it to last for months depending on the 
capacity of the power source. Timelapse photographs have to be taken 
with great precision as it shows moving object and they will be at a 
different place in each picture. If the time difference between each 
frame is not consistent, you cannot get good result in time lapse 
photography. MIOPS is capable of taking the pictures with great 
precision no matter how long it takes to do this. And this yields to 
high quality timelapse videos where everything is moving around 
smoothly. MIOPS takes care of the difficult part and the time lapse 
video software does the rest. Check the following video if you are 
curios of how a timelapse video looks like.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>HDR</b> </p><p>HDR (High Dynamic Range) photos look to good to be 
true because they are actually not. Digital processing of the same 
picture with different exposures is the main idea behind it. It is again
 done with picture processing software but it is the quality of the 
single pictures which makes a great HDR picture. MIOPS does here again a
 fantastic job by achieving highest precision and providing the best 
time savings. After you have specified the center exposure and step 
up/down numbers, MIOPS triggers your camera exactly per the settings. 
You don't need to do anything manually. MIOPS takes the overall control 
of your camera and does not stop until it gets the job done. Imagine 
that you had to change all the settings for each of the HDR pictures. It
 wouldn't be so much fun for sure. On top of that, it would take quite 
long time to complete all these features. MIOPS eliminates all this 
hassle by completing everything per your settings with zero manual 
involvement. It couldn't get easier.</p><p><b>External Port</b></p><p>MIOPS
 offers unlimited creativity not just with the built-in sensors and 
software but also with the capability of connecting external sensors as 
well. If you have a high-speed photography project in your mind which 
uses another type of sensor, this is not a blocker for MIOPS. MIOPS can 
accept signals from external sensors with the dedicated port, so you are
 not limited to light and sound events only. There are many different 
sensors in the market. Temperature, pressure and humidity sensors are 
only a few of them. If they are electrically compatible (which means the
 output signal must be between 0 and 3V) you can connect them to MIOPS. 
You can use the humidity sensor for example, to trigger the camera if 
the humidity level is above 65%, or you can hook up a pressure sensor to
 initiate lightning mode only if the air pressure is low. Every other 
sensor adds something to your creativity with MIOPS. In fact, MIOPS can 
actually trigger unlimited type of devices as well. The triggering 
mechanism of  MIOPS is not limited to DSLR cameras and flash units at 
all. You can trigger any other device which has a trigger port like your
 DSLR camera. You can use it for early warning system in a farm. If 
MIOPS detects any lightning activity, it can trigger a siren or warning 
mechanism, so no live stock remains outside. This kind of usage is quite
 different from high speed photography, but it is possible with the 
versatile design of MIOPS. The next section is even more interesting.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806442/files/20140823053539-fd2cdad66573b050123ee5da1d4b3cda_large.jpg?1408797339"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Special thanks to Tim Rice for taking this great photo for us!</i></span></p><p></p><h1>Advanced Scenarios with the Combination of Multiple Sensors</h1><p>The
 app brings the functionality of MIOPS to the ultimate level. On top of 
the basic modes (Lightning, Sound, Laser, Time Lapse, HDR and External 
Port) it adds a very cool feature called ""Scenario"". What does this 
mean? In this mode you can create a custom scenario with up to five 
different steps. In each step, MIOPS can use either the same or a 
different sensor. The result will be a totally unique set-up with 
sequential steps utilizing one or more sensors for the overall scenario.
 The following example will make everything clear. Let's say you are 
going out, but you know that there will be a thunderstorm tonight. You 
want to take lightning pictures so bad, but you have to leave. Here 
MIOPS is your saver with Scenario feature. You will add the following 
steps to your custom scenario:</p><p>* First Step: Let's say you want to
 start taking pictures after the sunset. In such a case you can add any 
amount of delay before initiating the action. You add the required delay
 until sunset, so MIOPS knows exactly when to start. If time is up, 
MIOPS will execute the second step.</p><p>* Second Step: You want to do 
some time lapse photography, just to see how the storm builds up. You 
define your timelapse parameters including interval, exposure and total 
period. MIOPS triggers your camera to take all of the required pictures 
for timelapse and when it is done it will move to the third step.</p><p>*
 Third Step: Now it is time to start lightning photography. MIOPS is 
ready to capture all of the lightning strikes as it has already waited 
until sunset and taken all these timelapse pictures. All have been done 
as you were away enjoying your night. This is just an imaginary example 
of what you can do with the scenario mode. When we say unlimited 
creativity, we really mean it. MIOPS has all of the required capability 
and flexibility to provide this. You can store up to three different 
scenarios in your smart-phone. They will be ready to use instantly. You 
can modify them anytime if you want to do something different.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806444/files/20140823053747-57fcae855cd2c6d6b360f6251699e517_large.png?1408797467"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1>Smartphone Compatible &amp; Bluetooth</h1><p>We have added the 
essential features of MIOPS to the device menu, so they can be easily 
configured and used on the device with no need to another tool. On the 
other hand, the real potential of MIOPS is revealed with the smartphone 
application (app). The app offers many advantages and features. First of
 all, you can take the total control of your MIOPS with the app. Any 
mode and any parameter can be adjusted with the app and then you can 
send the settings and commands to MIOPS with a single touch over 
Bluetooth connection. If MIOPS is mounted on your camera or tripod, you 
can leave your setup as it is and control MIOPS without even touching 
it. You will not need to adjust your setup again, nothing will move at 
all. Your smartphone has a big screen and MIOPS app uses it for your 
good. You don't need to look at the screen of MIOPS, everything is in 
your smartphone. The app needs to connect to MIOPS to send the settings 
only, at all other times you can use your phone with no interruption. 
MIOPS does not require the control of the app once the settings are 
received. If you want to switch to another mode, just open the app, 
connect to MIOPS and switch to another mode. It is so easy. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806446/files/20140823053906-fcf54781d9b31384de1ebd0acd6aaa57_large.png?1408797546"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806447/files/20140823054003-03ce71143191f5a77eca3dd7252e1410_large.png?1408797603"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1>Project Timeline</h1><p>We have passed almost all of our critical milestones.

can hook up external sensors as well. You can for example hook up a 
pressure sensor and use the pressure as a triggering event. It is 
possible to program MIOPS so that it will take a picture whenever 
someone steps on your door mat. You just need to place a pressure sensor
 under the mat and connect it to MIOPS. There are so many different 
sensors out there and this means you have unlimited options as well to 
demonstrate your creativity with MIOPS.MIOPS is not bigger than a
 credit card and only less than an inch in thickness. It is also light 
weight and consumes very little space in your camera bag. This is 
especially important if you carry your other heavy equipment in your 
bag. MIOPS has a colourful LCD screen and easy to use interface. You can
 configure your device using the on-board buttons and the screen. It 
gets even easier if you do this over your smart-phone. MIOPS has 
Bluetooth capability and with its dedicated smart-phone application you 
can configure MIOPS without even touching it. All of the device settings
 are also available on the application. On top of the basic modes and 
settings, the smart-phone application offers other features like cable 
release modes and scenario processing mode where you can define event 
scenarios using the combination of the different sensors. You can for 
example create a custom scenario like this: I want the sound mode to be activated after the sunset.
 You configure this using the application and the scenario is sent to 
MIOPS over Bluetooth connection. Afterwards, you can take your phone and
 go away, MIOPS will take care of the rest. It does not need the 
smart-phone to be close by to operate. You can store the scenarios in 
the application and reuse them whenever you want. You can store up to 
three scenarios and each of them can check against up two five different
 conditions measured by all of the sensors. MIOPS is Bluetooth 4.0 
compatible, so it is energy efficient, has great coverage and is 
compatible with iOS and Android smart-phones with Bluetooth 4.0.A mini-USB port has been added to MIOPS and it serves two important 
purposes. First of all, you can charge your MIOPS over this USB 
connection. You can also use a compatible USB charger or you can even 
charge it in your car just as you charge your cell phone. The 
rechargeable battery of MIOPS will last for days, it has energy saving 
features so you don't have to charge your battery very often. The second
 purpose it serves is the firmware upgrade. MIOPS will have an 
upgradeable firmware, so you can have new features with the release of 
new firmware. You will be able to download the new firmware and upgrade 
your MIOPS within a few minutes.High speed photography can be 
tricky sometimes. In some cases, you will need to trigger your flash 
unit, not your camera. In order to cover this, MIOPS has two dedicated 
outputs, one is for the camera and the other one is for the flash unit. 
You can use them separately or at the same time. They are electrically 
isolated from each other, so there is no risk of a short circuit. Also, 
each output isolates MIOPS from your camera or flash unit optically. 
This means in fact there is no electrical connection between your camera
 and MIOPS at all. One end of the connection cable goes to the remote 
shutter release port of your camera and the other ends goes to MIOPS. 
The cables are exchangeable, you can use your MIOPS with different 
cameras. You don't need to buy an extra unit for your second camera. 
MIOPS is compatible with most of the major makes and models. You just 
need to get the proper cable for your other camera. The interface of the
 cable connection is a standard 2,5 mm jack. Extension cables are 
commonly available in the market if you have a different setup in your 
mind where the camera has to stay far away from MIOPS. The same is also 
valid for the flash unit connection. It uses the standard 3,5 mm 
connection. Some DSLR cameras do not have a remote shutter release port,
 instead of this they can be triggered with an IR remote controller. If 
you own such a camera, you are also covered. MIOPS can trigger your 
camera with IR connection as well.Which Operation Modes Does MIOPS Have? MIOPS is a high-speed camera trigger with multiple modes 
combined in a single box with all built-in sensors. In order to use the 
available modes of MIOPS, you don't need to add anything else. 
Everything is already in the unit and ready to use. Switching between 
different modes is just a matter of a few clicks and it happens in 
seconds. It has basically six different modes, let's see them all.LIGHTNINGEven
 this mode is called lightning, there is actually so much more about it.
 Lightning is only one of the events that MIOPS can detect with its 
light sensor. When the lightning strikes, MIOPS detects in a few 
nanoseconds and triggers your camera. There is virtually no delay other 
than the lag time of the camera. MIOPS is well fast enough to capture 
bolts which stay visible for about 100 milliseconds. You don't need to 
keep your finger on the shutter release button without knowing when it 
is going to strike again. MIOPS will detect it and it will help you take
 the perfect picture. You can adjust the sensitivity of MIOPS in this 
mode. If you want to capture the biggest bolts only, you can set it to 
low sensitivity. If you set it to a high level sensitivity, it will even
 detect the smallest strikes which are usually not noticed by human eye.
 Fireworks is another great event to capture using MIOPS. The idea is 
the same with lightning strikes. You can maybe come up with other light 
events to be captured with MIOPS, we have only named two of them. Special thanks to Bryan Snider for taking this great photo for us!
LASERMIOPS can detect laser beams as well and they make
 the detection of so many events possible. The idea is very simple. If 
the laser beam is broken, then there must be something happened. And 
most of the time something happens in milliseconds, but it is not a big 
deal for MIOPS. The laser beam is so thin, even a water drop can break 
it. This is how MIOPS detects that the water drop is falling down and 
then it triggers the camera at the perfect time. This is almost 
impossible to do with human reflexes. Laser mode can also be used to 
detect the presence of people, animals or anything bigger than a water 
drop. This means you detect almost anything. One of the most common uses
 would be a photo trap. You know a wild animal is in the area and you 
want to take a picture of it. You never know when it will be coming 
back, but you don't need to. You can set up a laser source and MIOPS so 
that the laser beam will be broken when the animal walks through the 
beam and MIOPS will trigger the camera at that moment, or better said 
whenever you want it to be triggered. You can add some delay to the 
process. MIOPS can also turn your camera into a surveillance device. If 
an intruder breaks the beam, MIOPS will trigger your camera and you will
 have a picture on the intruder. Have a look at the following bullet!Is it too fast? MIOPS doesn't think so!SOUNDWhen it is all about high-speed photography, sound
 mode is the mode where things get serious. This is the essential mode 
to take high-speed pictures in a controlled studio environment. Even 
MIOPS is fast enough to take pictures of bullets or arrows, your camera 
is not that fast. Average DSLR camera has a lag time of about 50 
milliseconds. This is too long if your objects fly by in a few 
milliseconds. The sound mode of MIOPS does the trick. You prepare your 
setup in a completely dark room and bring your camera into bulb mode. As
 it is completely dark, the camera will not capture anything. What is 
needed? Light. What delivers the light in a dark room? A flash unit. 
This is why MIOPS triggers your flash unit instead of your camera. The 
built-in microphone of MIOPS detects the sound event and triggers the 
flash unit. When the flash unit is fired, the camera will capture a 
single frame. This is how you can eliminate the lag time of the camera 
and capture a real high-speed picture of the object. The main parameter 
of sound mode is the delay. Delay is the duration starting from the 
sound event until the flying object gets there where you want it to be. 
Using the application or the device menu of MIOPS, you can set any delay
 between 0 ms up to 999 ms. You can also adjust the sensitivity of sound
 mode. It will allow you to tweak your setup per your creativity. It is not a bottle anymore :)TIMELAPSEWhen it comes to MIOPS, it is not just 
sensors. In timelapse mode, MIOPS does not use any sensors but it 
benefits from the electronics and software to take sequential pictures 
within a time period with equal time difference between each of them. 
You can also specify the exposure of the pictures just per your wish. 
After you have adjusted your parameters, MIOPS will take care of the 
rest. You can do the adjustment on MIOPS itself or you can also use the 
smartphone application to configure MIOPS. You can set the interval 
anywhere between one second and an hour. As MIOPS has energy saving 
features like turning the LCD off, you can shoot timelapse photography 
for days without recharging. If you can supply MIOPS with an external 
power source, you can expect it to last for months depending on the 
capacity of the power source. Timelapse photographs have to be taken 
with great precision as it shows moving object and they will be at a 
different place in each picture. If the time difference between each 
frame is not consistent, you cannot get good result in time lapse 
photography. MIOPS is capable of taking the pictures with great 
precision no matter how long it takes to do this. And this yields to 
high quality timelapse videos where everything is moving around 
smoothly. MIOPS takes care of the difficult part and the time lapse 
video software does the rest. Check the following video if you are 
curios of how a timelapse video looks like.HDR HDR (High Dynamic Range) photos look to good to be 
true because they are actually not. Digital processing of the same 
picture with different exposures is the main idea behind it. It is again
 done with picture processing software but it is the quality of the 
single pictures which makes a great HDR picture. MIOPS does here again a
 fantastic job by achieving highest precision and providing the best 
time savings. After you have specified the center exposure and step 
up/down numbers, MIOPS triggers your camera exactly per the settings. 
You don't need to do anything manually. MIOPS takes the overall control 
of your camera and does not stop until it gets the job done. Imagine 
that you had to change all the settings for each of the HDR pictures. It
 wouldn't be so much fun for sure. On top of that, it would take quite 
long time to complete all these features. MIOPS eliminates all this 
hassle by completing everything per your settings with zero manual 
involvement. It couldn't get easier.External PortMIOPS
 offers unlimited creativity not just with the built-in sensors and 
software but also with the capability of connecting external sensors as 
well. If you have a high-speed photography project in your mind which 
uses another type of sensor, this is not a blocker for MIOPS. MIOPS can 
accept signals from external sensors with the dedicated port, so you are
 not limited to light and sound events only. There are many different 
sensors in the market. Temperature, pressure and humidity sensors are 
only a few of them. If they are electrically compatible (which means the
 output signal must be between 0 and 3V) you can connect them to MIOPS. 
You can use the humidity sensor for example, to trigger the camera if 
the humidity level is above 65%, or you can hook up a pressure sensor to
 initiate lightning mode only if the air pressure is low. Every other 
sensor adds something to your creativity with MIOPS. In fact, MIOPS can 
actually trigger unlimited type of devices as well. The triggering 
mechanism of  MIOPS is not limited to DSLR cameras and flash units at 
all. You can trigger any other device which has a trigger port like your
 DSLR camera. You can use it for early warning system in a farm. If 
MIOPS detects any lightning activity, it can trigger a siren or warning 
mechanism, so no live stock remains outside. This kind of usage is quite
 different from high speed photography, but it is possible with the 
versatile design of MIOPS. The next section is even more interesting.Special thanks to Tim Rice for taking this great photo for us!Advanced Scenarios with the Combination of Multiple SensorsThe
 app brings the functionality of MIOPS to the ultimate level. On top of 
the basic modes (Lightning, Sound, Laser, Time Lapse, HDR and External 
Port) it adds a very cool feature called ""Scenario"". What does this 
mean? In this mode you can create a custom scenario with up to five 
different steps. In each step, MIOPS can use either the same or a 
different sensor. The result will be a totally unique set-up with 
sequential steps utilizing one or more sensors for the overall scenario.
 The following example will make everything clear. Let's say you are 
going out, but you know that there will be a thunderstorm tonight. You 
want to take lightning pictures so bad, but you have to leave. Here 
MIOPS is your saver with Scenario feature. You will add the following 
steps to your custom scenario:* First Step: Let's say you want to
 start taking pictures after the sunset. In such a case you can add any 
amount of delay before initiating the action. You add the required delay
 until sunset, so MIOPS knows exactly when to start. If time is up, 
MIOPS will execute the second step.* Second Step: You want to do 
some time lapse photography, just to see how the storm builds up. You 
define your timelapse parameters including interval, exposure and total 
period. MIOPS triggers your camera to take all of the required pictures 
for timelapse and when it is done it will move to the third step.*
 Third Step: Now it is time to start lightning photography. MIOPS is 
ready to capture all of the lightning strikes as it has already waited 
until sunset and taken all these timelapse pictures. All have been done 
as you were away enjoying your night. This is just an imaginary example 
of what you can do with the scenario mode. When we say unlimited 
creativity, we really mean it. MIOPS has all of the required capability 
and flexibility to provide this. You can store up to three different 
scenarios in your smart-phone. They will be ready to use instantly. You 
can modify them anytime if you want to do something different.Smartphone Compatible & BluetoothWe have added the 
essential features of MIOPS to the device menu, so they can be easily 
configured and used on the device with no need to another tool. On the 
other hand, the real potential of MIOPS is revealed with the smartphone 
application (app). The app offers many advantages and features. First of
 all, you can take the total control of your MIOPS with the app. Any 
mode and any parameter can be adjusted with the app and then you can 
send the settings and commands to MIOPS with a single touch over 
Bluetooth connection. If MIOPS is mounted on your camera or tripod, you 
can leave your setup as it is and control MIOPS without even touching 
it. You will not need to adjust your setup again, nothing will move at 
all. Your smartphone has a big screen and MIOPS app uses it for your 
good. You don't need to look at the screen of MIOPS, everything is in 
your smartphone. The app needs to connect to MIOPS to send the settings 
only, at all other times you can use your phone with no interruption. 
MIOPS does not require the control of the app once the settings are 
received. If you want to switch to another mode, just open the app, 
connect to MIOPS and switch to another mode. It is so easy. Project TimelineWe have passed almost all of our critical milestones. Now we need your help to clear off the remaining items.

When will I get my Oco2 camera(s)?</b></p><p>A. [UPDATED] After finishing the campaign, we will start mass production in late September, and the first cameras will be shipped in October 2016. The shipment can take from 10 to 30 days (depending on the destination).</p><p><b>Q. Do you ship to the EU / Russia / Australia?</b></p><p>A. Yes, we ship worldwide.</p><p><b>Q. How will shipping be handled internationally?</b></p><p>A. US shipping is free. The shipping cost to EU, Canada, Russia and the rest of the world is $50 per order. The shipment does not include extra fees from customs or additional costs associated with your country. Also, there is no guarantee that this will work in your country (e.g. unknown power &amp; connectivity issues). If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order. </p><p><b>Q. When will the product be on the market after the campaign is over?</b></p><p>A. Once we have shipped cameras to all of our backers, we will release the product to the public.</p><p><b>Q. How many Oco2 cameras should I get for my home?</b></p><p>A. The super-wide 140-degree view angle allows you to use only one Oco2 camera in a room to view it entirely, so you can consider buying 2 or 3 cameras for your home. The 2-pack and 3-pack have the biggest discounts.</p><p><b>Q. Can I have additional cameras in different locations (i.e. home and office) and access them all from my app?</b></p><p>A. Sure, with the free plan you can have up to 15 Oco2 cameras on one account, and these cameras can be at different locations. With any extended plan, you have no limitation on the number of cameras that can be used in one account. You can move them any time and add as many cameras as you want. Oco2 makes it easy for homeowners and businesses to scale their security system instantly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b><a name=""CAMERASETUP"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>CAMERA SETUP</b></p><p><b>Q. How easy is it to set-up the Oco2 camera?</b></p><p>A. It usually takes 1–2 minutes to set up the Oco2 camera and no technical skills are required. Enter your Wi-Fi password into the app. You’ll be provided with a QR code, which you then show to your Oco2 camera. That’s it! Put the camera on any flat surface, adjust the camera tilt angle on magnetic stand, and enjoy</p><p><b>Q. Can I mount Oco2 camera on a wall or ceiling?</b></p><p>A. Yes, you can use the enclosed magnet stand as a wall mount. Use the enclosed screws and dowels or double-sided tape to mount the magnet stand to the wall or ceiling. Then just attach the camera to the magnet stand and adjust the tilt angle.</p><p><b>Q. Screw thread for tripod? What the…?</b></p><p>A. Sometimes you don’t have a shelf or a wall in the place you’d like to mount your camera. Oco2 has a standard 1/4'' screw thread that you can usually find in any photo camera. Using this screw thread, you can attach any tripod, including the flexible Gorillapod, which you can mount almost anywhere. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b><a name=""HOWITWORKS"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>HOW IT WORKS, FEATURES, APPS</b></p><p> </p><p><b>Q. Can I use Oco2 with Oco (gen.1) cameras?</b></p><p>A. Sure, Oco and Oco2 are compatible and you can use both Oco and Oco2 from the same account and using the same apps.</p><p><b>Q. Is Oco2 battery operated? How is the device powered? Is it 100% wireless?</b></p><p>A. Oco2 is plugged in to the power outlet by an enclosed power adaptor and a USB-to-microUSB cable. We don’t have a battery inside the camera; however our system can detect a lost connection to either power or WiFi. In that case, you will receive a mobile alert telling you that the Oco2 has lost its connection.</p><p><b>Q. Does Oco2 Move (Pan / Tilt)?</b></p><p>A. No, it doesn’t, but the 140-degree wide angle is enough to view the entire room, so you just don’t need to pan and tilt!</p><p> </p><p><b>Q. Does Oco2 have a zoom?</b></p><p>A. Yes, Oco2 has 8x digital zoom.</p><p><b>Q. Can I use Oco2 outdoors?</b></p><p>A. You can use Oco outdoors. However, the camera is not waterproof and is designed to be an indoor camera. So, if you can mount it under a tent, so it's hidden from the rain, then there will be no problem. The operating temperature for the camera is 14ºF–122ºF / -10°C–+50°C. The operating humidity is ~ 15–85%.</p><p><b>Q. Can I turn it off (privacy mode)?</b></p><p>A. Yes, you can turn it off. You can do it via the app or camera can be turned off automatically when you come home (using geofencing via IFTTT).</p><p><b>Q. What happens if the power goes out? What if someone steals or smashes my Oco2?</b></p><p>A. In case Oco2 loses connection to either power, you will receive a mobile alert telling you that Oco2 has lost its connection. You will be able to then see footage leading up to that incident.</p><p><b>Q. What happens if the Wi-Fi goes out?</b></p><p>A. Oco2 has SD-card support for local storage. If you have a SD card inserted, the camera records to the SD card when the Wi-Fi goes out, and you can access this footage from your phone as soon as the camera connects to the Cloud again.</p><p><b>Q. Can I use multiple phones with my Oco2?</b></p><p>A. You can use as many phones as you wish with the same account. You can also share your camera access with other users.</p><p><b>Q. Can I share my camera access with my family members?</b></p><p>A. Yes, using the app or web-account you can share the camera access with your family members, friends, or colleagues. The number depends on the price plan. On the free price plan, you can share the camera with 4 other users.</p><p><b>Q. How does Oco2 work?  How does it communicate with my mobile device?</b></p><p>A. Once you have set up your Oco2 smart camera, you can begin to monitor your home. You can watch a live stream any time via your Web Browser, iOS, Android mobile apps, or Mac OS, Windows, and Linux apps. Once the camera detects a motion or sound, it compresses and encrypts the video and sends a notification to the App or user’s email and records either the first 10 seconds of the event or the whole event (if the user is subscribed to one of the cloud recording plans). Because Oco uses self-learning algorithms, it gets smarter every day and learns to avoid false triggers such as tree movement in the window, etc. The video is stored in the cloud for 24 hours (can be extended up to 30 days with paid plans).</p><p><b>Q. Will Oco2 work with Android, Blackberry, Windows? When will my platform be supported? What smartphones does Oco2 work with?</b></p><p>A. You can have access to your camera via web account, apps for iOS, Android, Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. Oco2 works with any iPhone, iPad и iPod touch with iOS 7 or later and Android devices with Android 4.1 or later.</p><p>Advanced features such as Camera Grid are available for desktop monitoring, so those with multiple cameras can arrange screens to see views from each Oco camera all at one time on one frame.</p><p><b>Q. How fast should my Internet be?</b></p><p>A. Oco2 Camera requires a broadband Internet connection with an average bandwidth of 0.5–1.0 Mbit/s. The camera can adapt its video quality to fit the currently available bandwidth.</p><p><b>Q. Can I make my camera public and embed live feed from it on my website or blog?</b></p><p>A. Yes, you can. We provide you a simple code and you can embed it to any website and make you camera public.</p><p><b>Q. How much does the app cost? Are there in-app purchases?</b></p><p>A. All apps are free and don’t have any in-app purchases besides extended cloud price plans.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b><a name=""RECORDINGS"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>SD CARD, NOTIFICATIONS, RECORDINGS</b></p><p><b>Q. What are the subscription costs of Oco2?</b></p><p>A. Every Oco2 comes with free motion and sound alerts and 10-second clips of events for the past 24 hours, which is enough for most home use-cases. You can understand what was going on when camera detected the motion or sound. Optional subscription plans are available for extended cloud video storage and additional sharing options that range from $5 a month (or $50 a year) for 1 day cloud storage of extended video to $19 a month (or $199 a year) for 30 days.</p><p>Oco 2 has a hybrid storage option, so you can avoid storage fees by using the SD card.</p><p><b>Q. How do I access video that has been captured?</b></p><p>A. Oco2 smart camera uses Ivideon Cloud Service for the video and has mobile alerts and push notifications so you can see what is happening at home instantly. You can access a live stream or footage from your laptop, smartphone, or tablet from anywhere, at anytime.  </p><p><b>Q. Is there a Timeline feature? Can I see what has happened in the past?</b></p><p>A. With extended plans enabled, you can view Timeline for all camera motion- and sound-triggered recordings in the past. You can scroll back in time and view a video stream from a particular moment.</p><p><b>Q. How do the Smart notifications work? What type of notifications could I have?</b></p><p>A. When the camera detects a motion or sound, it sends an email and/or alert to your phone (depending on your settings).</p><p><b>Q. How Oco2 camera works with SD card?</b></p><p>A. Our cameras give you the flexibility to choose whether you want to store data on our servers, or you want to store data locally. With Oco2, you can use a SD card as a free local storage. It can be an addition to Cloud Storage or your single video storage location. </p><p>If you inserted a SD card into Oco2 and you have a free cloud plan, you can use the SD card as a free storage. To store a video archive on an SD card, we recommend you to use microSD up to 128 GB with speed class 6 or higher. You can access your footage from anywhere using apps.</p><p>If you have an extended plan and the camera records into the Cloud, it uses the SD card as a backup storage and records to the SD card only when Wi-Fi goes out. In this case, you can access your footage from anywhere using apps as soon as camera is online again.</p><p><b>Q. Can I adjust motion and sound detection sensitivity settings?</b></p><p>A. Yes, you can turn on/off motion and sound detection sensors and adjust its sensitivity</p><p><b>Q. How does Self-Learning algorithm exactly work?</b></p><p>A. Our self-learning algorithm makes Oco2 smarter by the hour as you use it. All videos are first analyzed by the camera and then sent to the Cloud. That’s where the magic happens. The Cloud learns to avoid movements that are frequently repeated (such as shadows, cars passing by, etc.) so you are not inundated with endless false notifications.</p><p><b>Q. Does Oco2 camera work when there is no movement?</b></p><p>A. Oco2 is runs constantly. You can watch the live streaming video from your app at any time you want it. But the video is not saved to the Cloud when there is no motion or sound detected.</p><p><b>Q. Can I schedule notifications? Turn off notifications? </b></p><p>A. Yes, you have these settings!</p><p><b>Q. How can I save/export video from Oco2 to my device/computer?</b></p><p>A. Export is a free feature and only the length of one clip is limited by your price plan. Export is available from your web-account. For free price plan you can export from your camera's SD card an unlimited number of clips (each up to 1 hour long) to your PC or Mac.</p><p><b>Q. Do I need to use your Cloud? Can I run my own storage server/FTP server/backend?</b></p><p>A. Our Cloud is required to take advantage of our self-learning system and advanced algorithms; the camera’s data needs to be analyzed on our cloud system. Oco2 can store your footage in the SD card as a local storage as well. A separate FTP/Backend is not supported by Oco2 as the data needs to be analyzed in our Cloud for the learning capabilities to work.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b><a name=""TECHNICALDETAILS"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>TECHNICAL DETAILS AND SECURITY</b></p><p><b>Q.

BUYING & SHIPPINGCAMERA SETUPHOW IT WORKS, FEATURES, APPSSD CARD, NOTIFICATIONS, RECORDINGSTECHNICAL DETAILS AND SECURITYINTEGRATIONS, GEOFENCINGOTHER QUESTIONS----------------------------------------------------- BUYING & SHIPPINGQ. When will I get my Oco2 camera(s)?A. [UPDATED] After finishing the campaign, we will start mass production in late September, and the first cameras will be shipped in October 2016. The shipment can take from 10 to 30 days (depending on the destination).Q. Do you ship to the EU / Russia / Australia?A. Yes, we ship worldwide.Q. How will shipping be handled internationally?A. US shipping is free. The shipping cost to EU, Canada, Russia and the rest of the world is $50 per order. The shipment does not include extra fees from customs or additional costs associated with your country. Also, there is no guarantee that this will work in your country (e.g. unknown power & connectivity issues). If it turns out that shipment to your country proves impossible, we will reimburse your order. Q. When will the product be on the market after the campaign is over?A. Once we have shipped cameras to all of our backers, we will release the product to the public.Q. How many Oco2 cameras should I get for my home?A. The super-wide 140-degree view angle allows you to use only one Oco2 camera in a room to view it entirely, so you can consider buying 2 or 3 cameras for your home. The 2-pack and 3-pack have the biggest discounts.Q. Can I have additional cameras in different locations (i.e. home and office) and access them all from my app?A. Sure, with the free plan you can have up to 15 Oco2 cameras on one account, and these cameras can be at different locations. With any extended plan, you have no limitation on the number of cameras that can be used in one account. You can move them any time and add as many cameras as you want. Oco2 makes it easy for homeowners and businesses to scale their security system instantly.  CAMERA SETUPQ. How easy is it to set-up the Oco2 camera?A. It usually takes 1–2 minutes to set up the Oco2 camera and no technical skills are required. Enter your Wi-Fi password into the app. You’ll be provided with a QR code, which you then show to your Oco2 camera. That’s it! Put the camera on any flat surface, adjust the camera tilt angle on magnetic stand, and enjoyQ. Can I mount Oco2 camera on a wall or ceiling?A. Yes, you can use the enclosed magnet stand as a wall mount. Use the enclosed screws and dowels or double-sided tape to mount the magnet stand to the wall or ceiling. Then just attach the camera to the magnet stand and adjust the tilt angle.Q. Screw thread for tripod? What the…?A. Sometimes you don’t have a shelf or a wall in the place you’d like to mount your camera. Oco2 has a standard 1/4'' screw thread that you can usually find in any photo camera. Using this screw thread, you can attach any tripod, including the flexible Gorillapod, which you can mount almost anywhere.   HOW IT WORKS, FEATURES, APPS Q. Can I use Oco2 with Oco (gen.1) cameras?A. Sure, Oco and Oco2 are compatible and you can use both Oco and Oco2 from the same account and using the same apps.Q. Is Oco2 battery operated? How is the device powered? Is it 100% wireless?A. Oco2 is plugged in to the power outlet by an enclosed power adaptor and a USB-to-microUSB cable. We don’t have a battery inside the camera; however our system can detect a lost connection to either power or WiFi. In that case, you will receive a mobile alert telling you that the Oco2 has lost its connection.Q. Does Oco2 Move (Pan / Tilt)?A. No, it doesn’t, but the 140-degree wide angle is enough to view the entire room, so you just don’t need to pan and tilt! Q. Does Oco2 have a zoom?A. Yes, Oco2 has 8x digital zoom.Q. Can I use Oco2 outdoors?A. You can use Oco outdoors. However, the camera is not waterproof and is designed to be an indoor camera. So, if you can mount it under a tent, so it's hidden from the rain, then there will be no problem. The operating temperature for the camera is 14ºF–122ºF / -10°C–+50°C. The operating humidity is ~ 15–85%.Q. Can I turn it off (privacy mode)?A. Yes, you can turn it off. You can do it via the app or camera can be turned off automatically when you come home (using geofencing via IFTTT).Q. What happens if the power goes out? What if someone steals or smashes my Oco2?A. In case Oco2 loses connection to either power, you will receive a mobile alert telling you that Oco2 has lost its connection. You will be able to then see footage leading up to that incident.Q. What happens if the Wi-Fi goes out?A. Oco2 has SD-card support for local storage. If you have a SD card inserted, the camera records to the SD card when the Wi-Fi goes out, and you can access this footage from your phone as soon as the camera connects to the Cloud again.Q. Can I use multiple phones with my Oco2?A. You can use as many phones as you wish with the same account. You can also share your camera access with other users.Q. Can I share my camera access with my family members?A. Yes, using the app or web-account you can share the camera access with your family members, friends, or colleagues. The number depends on the price plan. On the free price plan, you can share the camera with 4 other users.Q. How does Oco2 work?  How does it communicate with my mobile device?A. Once you have set up your Oco2 smart camera, you can begin to monitor your home. You can watch a live stream any time via your Web Browser, iOS, Android mobile apps, or Mac OS, Windows, and Linux apps. Once the camera detects a motion or sound, it compresses and encrypts the video and sends a notification to the App or user’s email and records either the first 10 seconds of the event or the whole event (if the user is subscribed to one of the cloud recording plans). Because Oco uses self-learning algorithms, it gets smarter every day and learns to avoid false triggers such as tree movement in the window, etc. The video is stored in the cloud for 24 hours (can be extended up to 30 days with paid plans).Q. Will Oco2 work with Android, Blackberry, Windows? When will my platform be supported? What smartphones does Oco2 work with?A. You can have access to your camera via web account, apps for iOS, Android, Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. Oco2 works with any iPhone, iPad и iPod touch with iOS 7 or later and Android devices with Android 4.1 or later.Advanced features such as Camera Grid are available for desktop monitoring, so those with multiple cameras can arrange screens to see views from each Oco camera all at one time on one frame.Q. How fast should my Internet be?A. Oco2 Camera requires a broadband Internet connection with an average bandwidth of 0.5–1.0 Mbit/s. The camera can adapt its video quality to fit the currently available bandwidth.Q. Can I make my camera public and embed live feed from it on my website or blog?A. Yes, you can. We provide you a simple code and you can embed it to any website and make you camera public.Q. How much does the app cost? Are there in-app purchases?A. All apps are free and don’t have any in-app purchases besides extended cloud price plans.  SD CARD, NOTIFICATIONS, RECORDINGSQ. What are the subscription costs of Oco2?A. Every Oco2 comes with free motion and sound alerts and 10-second clips of events for the past 24 hours, which is enough for most home use-cases. You can understand what was going on when camera detected the motion or sound. Optional subscription plans are available for extended cloud video storage and additional sharing options that range from $5 a month (or $50 a year) for 1 day cloud storage of extended video to $19 a month (or $199 a year) for 30 days.Oco 2 has a hybrid storage option, so you can avoid storage fees by using the SD card.Q. How do I access video that has been captured?A. Oco2 smart camera uses Ivideon Cloud Service for the video and has mobile alerts and push notifications so you can see what is happening at home instantly. You can access a live stream or footage from your laptop, smartphone, or tablet from anywhere, at anytime.  Q. Is there a Timeline feature? Can I see what has happened in the past?A. With extended plans enabled, you can view Timeline for all camera motion- and sound-triggered recordings in the past. You can scroll back in time and view a video stream from a particular moment.Q. How do the Smart notifications work? What type of notifications could I have?A. When the camera detects a motion or sound, it sends an email and/or alert to your phone (depending on your settings).Q. How Oco2 camera works with SD card?A. Our cameras give you the flexibility to choose whether you want to store data on our servers, or you want to store data locally. With Oco2, you can use a SD card as a free local storage. It can be an addition to Cloud Storage or your single video storage location. If you inserted a SD card into Oco2 and you have a free cloud plan, you can use the SD card as a free storage. To store a video archive on an SD card, we recommend you to use microSD up to 128 GB with speed class 6 or higher. You can access your footage from anywhere using apps.If you have an extended plan and the camera records into the Cloud, it uses the SD card as a backup storage and records to the SD card only when Wi-Fi goes out. In this case, you can access your footage from anywhere using apps as soon as camera is online again.Q. Can I adjust motion and sound detection sensitivity settings?A. Yes, you can turn on/off motion and sound detection sensors and adjust its sensitivityQ. How does Self-Learning algorithm exactly work?A. Our self-learning algorithm makes Oco2 smarter by the hour as you use it. All videos are first analyzed by the camera and then sent to the Cloud. That’s where the magic happens. The Cloud learns to avoid movements that are frequently repeated (such as shadows, cars passing by, etc.) so you are not inundated with endless false notifications.Q. Does Oco2 camera work when there is no movement?A. Oco2 is runs constantly. You can watch the live streaming video from your app at any time you want it. But the video is not saved to the Cloud when there is no motion or sound detected.Q. Can I schedule notifications? Turn off notifications? A. Yes, you have these settings!Q. How can I save/export video from Oco2 to my device/computer?A. Export is a free feature and only the length of one clip is limited by your price plan. Export is available from your web-account. For free price plan you can export from your camera's SD card an unlimited number of clips (each up to 1 hour long) to your PC or Mac.Q. Do I need to use your Cloud? Can I run my own storage server/FTP server/backend?A. Our Cloud is required to take advantage of our self-learning system and advanced algorithms; the camera’s data needs to be analyzed on our cloud system. Oco2 can store your footage in the SD card as a local storage as well. A separate FTP/Backend is not supported by Oco2 as the data needs to be analyzed in our Cloud for the learning capabilities to work.  TECHNICAL DETAILS AND SECURITYQ. Which Wi-Fi networks is Oco2 compatible with?A. The Oco2 camera is compatible with 2.4GHz and 5GHz 802.11 a/b/g/n networksQ. How secure is it? How secure is my footage?A.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This film is about three unlucky toy soldiers being played with by a young boy with a wild imagination. This is a war film and will have graphic content but will also be comedic. It will have an early 1970's theme to it as well. My team and I are very excited to get started on this project. The script and storyboard are nearly complete. Let me introduce the crew working on the project.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Helmus</strong></p>
<p>Co-writer of <u><i>Toy Soldiers</i></u> and will be playing a main character in the story. Dan has been my best friend for twelve years now and was in some of my first films. He has recently acted in our films like <u><i>Star Wars: Dark Shroud</i></u> as a stormtrooper and played the antagonist Mark in <i><u>Fear The Fighter</u></i> our latest film. He is a great member of the crew and is very excited to get out on the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Liddy</strong></p>
<p>Special Effects artist of <i><u>Toy Soldiers</u></i> and will be playing a small role in the story but has a much bigger job. He will be our cameraman working with me making sure that all of the shots we get are solid. Jack is very talented with the camera and VFX. He has recently acted in our films <u><i>Star Wars: Dark Shroud</i></u> as the protagonist and played the trainer in <i><u>Fear The Fighter</u></i> our latest film.</p>
<p><b>Brendan Miske</b></p>
<p>Director and writer of <i><u>Toy Soldiers</u></i>. I have been making films since the seventh grade and look to continue studying film in college. I hope that this project will be another great edition to my portfolio.  Working with Jack and Dan is fantastic because they are hard workers and are very reliable. I will be playing a main character in this film as well and I am very excited to work on this next big project.</p>
<p><strong>Spenser Sembrat</strong></p>
<p>Last but not least is Spenser, who has recently joined the team and has been a great edition. He will be playing a main character as well in <i><u>Toy Soldiers</u></i>. He has helped us on our most recent film <i><u>Fear The Fighter</u></i> playing a small role but also worked as a cameraman as well. Cannot wait to see what he can do. It will be his first big role in anything we have ever done and he too is excited to get out there.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For our film we are now in the process of crowdfunding which is always a great way to budget a movie. Unlike <i><u>Fear The Fighter</u></i> which was a very low budget movie, this film will require more in order to make it look more realistic since it is a war film set in the 1970's.</p>
<p><strong>Costumes, Props, &amp; Practical Effects</strong></p>
<p>Most of the money donated will go towards the costumes and props used in the film. Costumes will require pieces like helmets, military button downs, military cargo pants, personalized dog tags, airsoft guns, tactical chest pieces, belts, canteens, fake cigarettes, face makeup, and back packs. We want the costumes to look as realistic as possible so that they are believable. The left over donations we have will go towards practical effects. We need fake grenades, old 1970's military style walkie talkies, fake explosives, big bags of soil, and much more.</p>
<p>With your help we will be able to make this our best film yet. Our goal is $1000 and any donations you make your name will be put into the credits of the film and we will give you a big shoutout for helping us out. So you could donate $1 and could have your name at the end credits. Our solemn purpose is to entertain you and hopefully get a laugh or two as well. We hope that you can help us out and we will highly appreciate any donation made towards the project because without you guys we won't be able to make this our greatest film ever.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help us out. Get the word out we want people to know about <i><u>Toy Soldiers</u></i>. We want our audience to be excited about our next film and want them to watch it and hear their feedback once we release it. I hope that anyone reading this will be able to contribute in some way. Even if donating isn't an option for you, tell people about our upcoming film!</p>

My name is Larry T Hill(you might know me asFrugalist Massive, Sinbad, D man, Nody or Dylan)

Yup, no specific campaign clip sorry but I’ve got a little one take rambling audio spiel here if you like. It’s here, you could open it in a background tab and imagine some editing. Until I re-record it. Thanks for your imagination.
Playing street style with my original busking amp on my bike at theLove on a Real Train Warehouse Party in Melbourne
This little dream
I’ve been a musician for thirteen years or so, mainly playing drums and percussion, in bands you’ve probably never heard of. In late 2008, I left the busyness of Sydney’s legendary Figureight Sustainable Event Production Inc. to find a more rewarding way of being creative and experiencing more of this great Australian land. Slow solo travel left me missing music creation and I lacked the bandmates or instruments to do so. So I secretly and slowly began writing songs with a looping app. This was fresh, new and scary: I was slowly teaching myself how to sing, loop and craft songs all at once. I took this on in a radically self-sufficient way, diving into hitchhike touring whilst developing the performance on the fly and now I'm seeking support for the first time. 
 
As a migrant I had my first flight at 3.5wks old and a very mobile early childhood. More recently, I have been interested in overland alternative transport and have not flown in the past 10 years. This ethos is a strong part of the vision as I sail towards Sri Lanka from mid july, crewing other peoples boats to make my way there.
 

Here I'm meant to say: ""What I Need & What You Get""
The focus is funding two things:
$530 for the beautiful Roland AC-33 battery powered busking amplifier. Virtually impossible to track down second hand because they are so good. My friend Lee Hardisty has one and would almost signup for being an ambassador for them. He uses it for everything from busking to playing at weddings and can hardly stop raving about it. This will be a replacement/upgrade for my Roland Mobile Cube which I scored on ebay for $90 and had recently stolen in Coober Pedy on this trip up. :(
 
$550 to fund filmmaker Tim Parish to shoot, edit and publish a clip for my new tune ""Croc Fever"" which i'm also hoping to enter into the NT song of the year awards shortly. Tim is a talented visual artist who has developed Verb Studios, a hybrid media art studio featuring his diverse body of work ranging from short films, music videos, documentaries. Also check out his work athttp://vimeo.com/verb or on the gallery tab above.
 
Croc Fever Recording is here (open in a background tab to listen) its the basic live to 2track mix, produced swiftly for NT song of the year awards submission: no luck there however)
 
$70 buffer ? There are not-so-visible crowdfunding and credit card fees which are included in this initial figure. Please preference straight credit card payments over Paypal if possible. 
 
Incentives?
I’m offering a few incentives for some of the contributions as per the usual model here, but I also welcome straight donations in the spirit of gifting. One of my challenges is being time poor and - through perpetual travel-touring I have limited resources in my backpack. I don't carry a laptop so I'm writing to you now from a Library computer in Darwin. Even big successful campaigns seem to have issues with keeping up with all the requests. 

Left: My original eBay score for $90 ($250+ new), Mobile Cube - the one that was stolen. Right: The amazing roland AC-33 - Busking amp with an amazing sound. Yes, I am using the loss of my little amp above as an opportunity to upgrade as well. As nice and handy as the little mobile cube it was hard-pressed keeping up with road noise when playing on the street.
Moooore? You want more?
If the campaign goes well and clears the target I can look at some other gear upgrades and offering Tim more funds. In terms of gear my little ipod touch, which I got for the special looping apps a few years ago could do with an upgrade to an ipad which goes for around $250 second hand online. It’s not just the size of the screen but the actual processing power as well. This would be great for the looping workshops in particular with youth. All the great looping and live music apps are only on the iProducts unfortunately.
The Vision
My initial vision with this campaign is to test the crowdfunding waters whilst hoping to elevate my art through quality mobile amplification and a nice clip to accompany my troppo tune. I want to get back out there playing on the street with a good sound, it has been a small nightmare trying to sort out battery powered systems to play market gigs up here. On my sailing journey I’m going to need to have my own self sufficient setup for keeping crew amused and performing at odd spots along the way.
 
Croc Fever?
I would love to showcase the Croc Fever tune in a nice clip that can be shot whilst Tim and myself both happen to be in the Top End together. Tim also leaves in mid July heading for Europe.
I hope this campaign will go well then I will take on a bigger one for support on my motherland voyage. Theres a little teaser of Croc Fever on this clip over here.. as you will see it will be great to showcase this tune in a more polished and fun way than this clip which ends because we ran out of space on the memory cards.
 
It’s about the tricky challenge of wanting to swim in the stinking hot “build-up season” which is when the Crocodiles are active in the rivers, swimming holes and beaches.

What I have managed to do already without financial support (CV style)



National hitch-hike touring over 30 000kms to play at many of Australia's wonderful music festivals such as Woodford Folk Festival (QLD), Rainbow Serpent Festival (VIC), Burning Seed (OZ Burning Man in NSW), Wide Open Space Festival near Alice Springs, Darwin Festival and Gurruwilling Eclipse Festival in Arnhem Land.


That Roo clip and all my video clips and audio recordings so far have been produced in a completely DIY and zero-budget fashion. I have been blessed with generous filmmakers who were happy to have a play with filming me in various settings. (roo clip was a Canadian WWOOFer in Sunshine Coast, QLD Australia who liked the tunes).


I’ve buiḻt a relatively slick website from the ground up using free tools http://quietbackroad.tumblr.com - this has helped greatly with booking gigs and playshops. Much square time.


Established a unique performance which can be adapted to almost any environment.


Developed the looping playshops, supporting emerging artists, youth and other musicians to get music out of their heads and into live vocal looping.


Created digital USB albums as an alternative to CDs and a handy, re-usable way to make digital music and videos tangible objects.   


 My 2012 hitchhike tour. 28 000kms in that year. Living a dream, playing: Songlines Stage Woodford Folk Festival

My performance bio is this:
""With a striking solo performance, Larry T Hill crafts cheeky musical tales using just voice and a looping pedal. He records layer upon layer of his voice live on stage, creating elaborate yet fun musical pieces which you might expect to hear from a small band. Performances can be energetic and animated, soulful and outrageous, witty, pretty or sometimes just silly. The sharp beats, deep basslines and sweet harmonies will have you hooked. Singing the tunes all the way home.""

I have been sitting here trying to verbalize my love for the art in a way that ""resonates with the reader"" for a few hours now, but so far I am coming up short. Photography isn't just a part of my life; it lies within the way I view the world.

<p class=""p1"">I filed a police report with all of my serial numbers and looked into every insurance option imaginable from travelers insurance to work insurance to calling Visa to see if they have any type of protection on the lenses I bought with my credit card.

<p class=""p1"">And now I am asking for your help! </p>
<p class=""p1"">Everything I lost:</p>
<p class=""p1"">-Canon 50D<br/> -Canon 35mm f/1.4L (my newest purchase)<br/> -Canon 50mm f/1.4<br/> -Canon 20mm f/2.8<br/> -Sunpak 383 external flash<br/> -16GB CF card <br/> -2GB CF card <br/> -Contour HD helmet camera<br/> -Flash triggers <br/> -Brand new Lowepro Slingshot 202</p>
<p class=""p1"">After some thought and research, rather than directly replacing all of my gear I would like to upgrade to the 5D Mark II with another L lens. Ideally it would be amazing to raise enough money to cover everything I lost, but I am starting at $3000 to at least buy a 5D Mark II off Craigslist ($1600) and the 35mm f/1.4L ($1479) again (and cover the fees + taxes associated with the campaign).</p>
<p class=""p1"">I am not the biggest fan of asking people for money for something like this, but hopefully the added perks make it more worthwhile without devaluing my photos. Choose from anything on my <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/kellymason"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s1"">Flickr</span></a> or <a href=""http://kellymason.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s1"">website</span></a>.

<p class=""p1"">Kelly</p></div>","My name is Kelly Mason, and I am a 23-year-old photographer from Seattle, WA. I have been sitting here trying to verbalize my love for the art in a way that ""resonates with the reader"" for a few hours now, but so far I am coming up short. Photography isn't just a part of my life; it lies within the way I view the world. Photography is rooted in my mind in a way that I cannot adequately describe with words, but I hope my passion is conveyed through my work.
I have been shooting seriously for about 6 years now. My subject matter ranges from live band to candid lifestyle portraits, but most of my portfolio is comprised of music. As far as clientele goes, I have shot the Vans Warped Tour three times, Identity Festival, and countless other friends and shows (but those are two of my recent favorites).

He is now retired and on a fixed income and his current cameras are over ten years old and do not work the way they used to. If every band or event who was ever photographed by Pops and shared in the bueaty of his talents just gave a small amount there would be more than enough to buy the required ""gear"" to allow Pops to continue his passion!</h3>

<p>We set out to create the world's brightest and most versatile, adventure ready LED light. A light that could keep up with unbridled creativity and imagination. A light that would enable amazing moments never before captured in low or no light conditions.</p>
<p><b>Our mission was to create a:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Best in class mobile light for photo and video professionals</li>
<li>Best in class light for everyday tasks at home, at work, with a smart phone and for walking and biking</li>
<li>Best in class light for outdoor enthusiast and extreme athletes</li>
</ul>
<p><b>A key design criteria was to make sure the light could go anywhere a GoPro Session 4 (and now 5) camera can go - literally! </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fit into the GoPro Session Frame and GoPro mounting system</li>
<li>Match or exceed waterproof and drop test specifications</li>
<li>Light beam angle complements camera lens' wide angle</li>
<li>Match battery life</li>
</ul>

<p><b>We wanted to make the Torch the ""Swiss Army Knife"" of lights so we designed in:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>TWO 1/4 20 standard camera mounts to allow for flexible mounting orientations</li>
<li>MAGNET built into the body to quickly mount to a car hood, tail gate, pole etc</li>
<li>FILTERS for photographic, dive and mood effects = serious photos or serious fun!</li>
<li>SOFT LIGHT with a diffusion cap for a lantern like glow</li>
<li>QUICK CLIP for a simple and secure way to mount to a belt or backpack</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Journey</h1>
<p>Over the past 2 years we have hit all our milestones. We started with defining the MRD (Marketing Requirements Document) and progressed all the way through final design, validation testing and release for tooling.  <b>The major R&amp;D events and expenses are complete.</b></p>

We set out to create the world's brightest and most versatile, adventure ready LED light. A light that could keep up with unbridled creativity and imagination. A light that would enable amazing moments never before captured in low or no light conditions.
Our mission was to create a:

Best in class mobile light for photo and video professionals
Best in class light for everyday tasks at home, at work, with a smart phone and for walking and biking
Best in class light for outdoor enthusiast and extreme athletes

A key design criteria was to make sure the light could go anywhere a GoPro Session 4 (and now 5) camera can go - literally! 

Fit into the GoPro Session Frame and GoPro mounting system
Match or exceed waterproof and drop test specifications
Light beam angle complements camera lens' wide angle
Match battery life

Torch design goal was to go anywhere GoPro Camera can go AND fit into the GoPro and traditional camera mounting systems Torch design goal was to go anywhere GoPro Camera can go AND fit into the GoPro and traditional camera mounting systems
We wanted to make the Torch the ""Swiss Army Knife"" of lights so we designed in:

TWO 1/4 20 standard camera mounts to allow for flexible mounting orientations
MAGNET built into the body to quickly mount to a car hood, tail gate, pole etc
FILTERS for photographic, dive and mood effects = serious photos or serious fun!
SOFT LIGHT with a diffusion cap for a lantern like glow
QUICK CLIP for a simple and secure way to mount to a belt or backpack

The Journey
Over the past 2 years we have hit all our milestones. We started with defining the MRD (Marketing Requirements Document) and progressed all the way through final design, validation testing and release for tooling.  The major R&D events and expenses are complete.

</h3><h3>The Short Story:</h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We’ve all heard the saying “A picture is worth a thousand
words.”  Well in some cases, it can
be worth much more – a photograph can be the means to a way out of a life limited by
blindness and poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I’m a photographer from Squamish BC, and in the new year I
will be travelling to Cambodia to volunteer with Seva Canada, an international
development organization restoring sight and preventing blindness in 12 of the poorest
countries in the world.  I will be capturing
images that show Seva’s work in Cambodia, which they will then be able to share in
order to raise awareness and generate funding.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Photography is storytelling.  And visual imagery is the best way to help individuals understand
the hardships faced by blind people and their families in these poor and remote
areas, as well as the impact that donors can have when they get involved.  I want to help Seva tell these stories.  And I’m hoping you can help me do that.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It’s all happening very soon – we are due to leave the first week
of January!  I need to raise $3000
to cover travel expenses.  So I’m
turning to you amazing people to help me help Seva.  </span></p><p>In exchange, I’m offering some awesome perks – limited
edition block mounted prints, a hard cover book of my images from Nepal,
beautiful Paperblanks journals, even a personal photo shoot.  Your contribution will help me get to
Cambodia so that we can share the story of how the power of sight transforms
lives.</p>

</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Two winters ago, I travelled to Nepal with Seva
Canada, an organization working to eradicate preventable blindness and provide access to eye care to those most in need - women, children and
people living in extreme poverty and isolation. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I photographed patients as they arrived at eye
camps and eye hospitals, had their vision assessed, received treatments, and
regained their sight - and ultimately an opportunity for a better life.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">According to the World Health Organization,
restoring a person’s sight is one of the most cost-effective health
interventions to break the cycle of poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Blindness can deprive a family in so many ways. A
blind person cannot work, and often a spouse or a child bears the burden of
their care, meaning they also cannot work or attend school. Restoring vision to
just one person positively impacts many, as individuals can then earn an
income, support their families and attend school, ultimately benefitting the
entire community.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The images that I captured for Seva have been
used in various media to both raise awareness and generate funding in order for
them to achieve their vision. The work that Seva is doing is truly remarkable.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p>As a photographer who has full vision in only one eye, I feel particularly connected to this cause. It was extremely moving to witness people being given their vision back and to experience their overwhelming gratitude for this gift.</p><p>This time I have been invited to photograph Seva's programs in Cambodia. It means so much to me to be able to support this organization in a tangible way.

We don't do sales except for Kickstarter campaigns and Black Friday so back the campaign before it's over to make sure you get in :)  Rhino Arc II is a compact 4-axis motorized pan/tilt/focus head that enables you to capture unreal video and time-lapse shots. It can hold up to 15lbs of equipment (camera + lens + monitor, etc) and can mount to a tripod or to your Rhino Slider.   Rhino Arc II automates camera movement for interviews, time-lapses and b-roll to save you time and make sure you get the shot on the first take. You can quickly set up multi-point moves with the integrated dual joystick controls. The main joystick controls pan/tilt, and the front joystick controls slide/focus. If you're not next to your camera or are in a tight space, you can setup a move with our new Rhino Arc app for iOS devices.   Here's some quick bullet points if you don't feel like scrolling through the  info below:
15lb load capacity on pan & tilt
Stand-alone functionality lets you replace your fluid head with ultra smooth, repeatable motorized movement
Backwards compatible with Rhino Slider EVO and EVO Motor
Optional motorized follow focus (Rhino Focus) for making sure you nail focus
Optional slider motor (High Torque & High Speed Motor) controls your linear movement
Capture day to night time-lapses with Light Lapse (won't be ready on launch)
Built-in output for powering your DSLR or Mirrorless (requires optional Rhino Power dummy battery)
Built-in 501 plate receiver (includes 501 compatible plate)
OLED screen and dual joysticks for live control over all 4 axis
iOS app for remotely controlling and more control over keyframes
Motorized mounting using its pan motor
Those are just some of the features so keep reading to find out the rest of the details.  Rhino Slider Along with Rhino Arc II, we're introducing an updated Rhino Slider. It still comes in both Carbon (carbon fiber rails) and Pro (stainless steel) models but has been updated to carry heavier loads and operate vertically. We also changed the way it mounts to tripods.   We hate setting up gear. That's why we make it quick and easy so we can spend more time filming. The new Tripod Quick Mount system lets you mount your slider from above so you don't have to spin your tripod onto the bottom of it. Better yet, we added two more of these Tripod Quick Mounts to the ends of our 42"" Carbon and Pro sliders. This makes setting up a Rhino Slider on two tripods infinitely quicker.   Rhino Focus  When you're moving a camera on a slider, your focus point is constantly changing. Autofocus on cameras is getting a lot better but you still can't control where it's going to snap to. Keyframing focus is essential to be able to focus on what you want when you're moving. Rhino Focus uses a carbon fiber industry standard rod and .8 cinema pitch gears. It also includes rubber focus ring gears to let you use your photography lenses.

We will still offer a High Speed Motor that has the original gearing of our EVO motor if you want to move faster (you can choose between the two after the campaign is over). *the new High Torque motor is not compatible with your old Rhino Motion Controller. You can still use your old EVO motor with Rhino Arc II however.  
 
  What is a Robotic Camera Assistant? When we looked at our workflow as filmmakers, we realized that we do a ton of different things. We shoot narrative docs, interviews, weddings, Youtube content, and endless b-roll and time-lapses to make it all cohesive.  Our goal with Rhino Arc II is to automate your camera movement so you can focus on telling your story. Keyframe Mode  The original Rhino Arc could do a 2 point, 2 axis move. Rhino Arc II can do a 5 point, 4 axis move. Use the dual-joystick controls and set your slider position, pan, tilt, and focus and click the joystick. Repeat this up to 5 times and playback with a repeatable, fixed speed move or use the joystick to control the speed of playback.   Rack Mode  You don’t always need a slider but you always need b-roll. That’s why we created rack mode. When paired with Rhino Focus, simply move your camera and set your focus. Move to where you think you’ll pan or tilt and set your focus again. Now, as you move, your focus will automatically rack perfectly as you control your movement in real time with the joystick. Imagine how much time you’ll save nailing focus on the first try.  Interview mode  Doing professional interviews is a staple for most freelancers. Adding motion to your camera ups your production value and is a great way to land higher paying gigs. But what happens if your subject changes their sitting position or moves out of focus? With interview mode you can pause the looping slider by touching the joystick on Arc II or in the app and discreetly reframe and refocus without having to setup a new move and risk killing the moment.   LightLapse Mode It is so frustrating to have to wait to setup your time lapse until dark or have your time lapse cut short by the sunrise. That’s why we created Light Lapse. Using a light sensor and a new iOS app, you’ll be able to capture day to night, Holy Grail time-lapses with the click of a button. This feature won’t be available on launch but we’ll invite our backers to BETA test it when it’s ready.Note: We are only launching this feature on iOS to start and we'll prioritize getting Sony A7 cameras supported first. We'll develop for Android and other cameras based on demand.  
  UI and App 
 Having actual physical controls for motion control is super important. What if your phone dies, doesn’t connect, or the app glitches out? Professional work requires extreme reliability. Because of this, you have full control with physical controls to set up Arc. But, some things are just better in an app experience. With the Arc app, you can setup and playback your move using the virtual joystick. You can create up to 5 key frames and scrub through them for real time remote control. We'll have an iOS version available on launch and consider Android if we have enough demand.   Rhino Power  Changing batteries is a pain. Especially when they only last 45 minutes...thanks S**y. that’s why you’re able to power your camera or monitor directly from Rhino Arc. No more changing batteries mid interview or having your camera run out of juice on a long time-lapse. Battery Life  Powering up to 4 motors and a camera takes a lot of power so we built in a massive 60wh battery pack into Arc. It will allow for 5 hours of continuous use with everything powered up and up to 48 hours for time-lapses. If time is tight it charges in less than 2 hours using our ultra fast international charger.Mounting Plate   A lot of filmmakers use the 501 quick release plate for video work so we built a 501 receiver and plate into Arc. The problem with these plates is how to mount them to your camera. We solved this with a easy to access mounting tool built into the receiver. No more looking for keys or coins to mount your 501 plate. Spoiler alert - it doubles as a bottle opener too.  
 
 Motorized Mounting 
 Setting up gear is time consuming. So we try to make it as quick as possible. Rhino Arc uses one of its motors to mount to Rhino Slider or a tripod and the mounting tool to snug it in place.

<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJLxXovOPLo"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>We started dreaming of iBubble in March 2015. Since then, we’ve refined the idea a lot, both in terms of functionalities and technical specs.</p>
<p><b>During the product definition stage</b><br/>We’ve interacted with hundreds of people from the diving community (scuba divers, free divers, underwater movie professionals, scientists…). We’ve gathered user feedback from experts and amateurs. In fact, we’ve leveraged every single opportunity to meet and discuss with our future backers, from huge diving shows to Facebook or face to face meetings. Our motivation was simple: <b>we absolutely needed to know what YOUR dream underwater camera would be</b>. Because we believe that’s the only way to deliver a great product.</p>
<p><b>On the technical side</b><br/>We first identified the fields of expertise required to make iBubble work, from hydrodynamics to energy management, via signal processing and embedded software. We then developed<b> a proof of concept </b>(a real-life feasibility test to make sure our technical hypothesis are valid) on the most critical technological breakthrough: <b>underwater positioning</b>. Given that high frequency radio transmission, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth don’t work underwater, we had to find another way to ensure communication between the diver and the drone. We’ve looked at other industries and eventually found a <b>solution mixing the best of marine mammals’ echolocation and computer-based tracking algorithms</b>. For all other required functionalities, we’ve either considered technologies available off-the-shelf, and/or performed preliminary studies to check that we could meet our timeframe, quality and costs expectations. We’ve chosen to develop <b>several prototypes</b> and test our ideas in situ.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461319462/junior_j8gyiu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The technical prototype V5 ""Beluga"" you can see in the videos is our most advanced one in terms of functionalities. This prototype integrates ultrasonic transmitters that allow to detect the diver 360° around it. Thanks to the connected bracelet, the diver can change the camera angle scenarios or ask to resurface at the end of the dive.<br/>We also implemented a feature that greatly improves the accuracy of the shots: real-time video recognition. This technology opens many possibilities for the future.<br/>Great work has been done on the fluidity and the precision of the movements. We are now working on the integration of new scenarios such as the 360°.</p></li>
<li><p>The yellow prototype is a design mock-up. We wanted you to have an idea of how cool iBubble will look in the future. Its shape takes into account architecture constraints of all functionalities <b>iBubble will have onboard in a slick, hydrodynamic design</b>. Integrating the different technologies is a time-consuming phase, which should be complete at the end of this calendar year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Regarding the bracelet</b><br/>We have already developed its critical functionality: <b>the positioning system’s transmitter</b>. You can see its first prototype handled by our diver in the Technical Prototype V5 video above. How does it work? The transmitter emits a low frequency signal that the drone uses to calculate its position relative to the diver. The antenna, battery and electronics included in this prototype seem bulky, but they are design to meet a &gt;1 km (~1 mile) range requirement. Once they are scaled back to iBubble’s 25m/80ft range, they will fit in a dive computer.</p>
<p>We’ve also worked on the bracelet’s future <b>design and user interface</b>. You can see one of the previous rendering in the pictures below. In the future, it will also integrate a <b>display</b> to make it even simpler. To industrialize this bracelet, we will turn to a well-known dive computer manufacturer. Several of them have approached us, and we’ve decided that it would be more efficient to leverage their expertise. Backers updates will inform you regularly of our progress on this front.</p>
<p><b>What’s next? The product development</b><br/>We’ve defined a <b>robust methodology</b> based on our <b>extended experience in consumer goods industrialisation and high-end software development</b>. We’ve already pre-selected key partners for both the development and the production phase. You’ll find the main steps of the industrialization process in the timeline below.</p>

<p>We’ve assembled an A-team of <b>passionate divers</b>, <b>underwater world enthusiasts</b> and people with the <b>skills to turn our idea into reality</b>: embedded software developers, manufacturing &amp; supply chain managers for some of largest manufacturers, mechatronics experts, experienced business model designers and creative innovation marketers. <b>We love what we do and do it well!</b></p>
<p>Our team members have completed projects ranging from <b>critical software</b> for commercial <b>airliners</b> to France’s best selling electric car or <b>Hexo+, the world’s first autonomous flying camera</b>. We’re also working with partners who are leaders in their fields, whether it’s <b>launching startups</b> or turning Indiegogo hopes into successful industrial projects.</p>Why are we tooting our horn here? Because launching a product from scratch is a difficult process. And we certainly don’t want to mess it up. Truth be told, we want to go diving with iBubble as much as you do! Delivering a product too late or short on functionality is not an option for us.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489585593/mkjluks18piwggmhgjhl.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><b><b>2. FILMING ANGLES, USES AND MODES</b></b></p>
<p><b>What will iBubble do?</b></p>
<p><span>iBubble will follow divers underwater, filming quality images autonomously. Several filming modes will be available, including moves impossible for a diver to perform (such as rapid vertical climbs). Divers will easily switch between modes thanks to a convenient control bracelet. iBubble will also feature a manual mode for close-ups. Back to the surface, the divers will produce movies with minimal editing, share them with friends or use them to improve their technique.</span></p>
<p><b>Where will iBubble be positioned when filming the diver?</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The location of the drone will depend on the location of the diver and the filming mode selected.</span></p>iBubble's first version will analyze the best angle, keeping the bracelet at the center of the shot. But its wide angle will also capture the surroundings.<p> </p>
<p><b>Which filming modes will be available?</b></p>

<p><b>3. ABOUT iBUBBLE: ORIGINS, COST, TIMELINE...</b></p>
<p><b><span>How did you come up with this idea?</span></b></p>
<p><span>iBubble is the brainchild of Kevin Delfour and Xavier Spengler, keen divers, photographers and technology enthusiasts. They were looking for a way to film quality underwater videos without having to deal with heavy and cumbersome equipment. The idea of an autonomous wireless underwater camera imposed itself.</span></p>
<p><span>Delfour and Spengler turned to Startup Maker, the startup studio behind Hexo+ (1.3M$ on Kickstarter in 2014). The studio provided a complete business development and marketing support team.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, Nicolas Gambini and Benjamin Valtin are respectively CEO and CMO of Notilo+, the company created to support iBubble.</span></p>
<p><span><span><b>When will iBubble be in customers' hands?</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>iBubble units will be shipped to customers in May 2018.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><b>Is there already a functioning product?</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Between July and December 2015, we’ve developed two technical prototypes to validate the positioning technology closed to the diver. It works well, even if it does not have its final design. By the end of the year, a prototype will integrate the same technology to the design final look, thanks to the funds raised in April.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><b>What's the extend of Guillaume Nery and Julie Gautier’s involvement in the project?</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Guillaume Néry is a professional filmmaker as well as a world-class athlete. His partner, Julie Gautier, directed Gravity and other stunning underwater films. We've submitted our idea to them early on. They were taken by it and immediately started contributing to the project. Today, Guillaume Nery is acting as iBubble's ambassador but also helps define technical characteristics, along with Julie Gautier.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>4. TECHNICAL SPECS</b></p>
<p><span><b>Which cameras are compatible with iBubble ?</b></span></p>
<p><span>For our first version, we are working with GoProⓇ Hero versions 3, 4 and 5.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Tell me about the engines</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">iBubble is equipped with 7 propellers</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">4 engines sit in the nozzles, at a 45° angle from the central axle. They propulse the drone forward and backward.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">3 other engines enable upward and downward movements, as well as rotations. They also stabilize the drone.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Each engine is made of three 2.5” blades which can rotate in both directions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><b>You say that iBubble will be quiet, can you explain further?</b></span></p>
<p><span>iBubble doesn’t rely on a ballast system, so there are no actual bubbles! In addition to that, the engines are positioned inside the drone, where we’re trying to contain the noise. Our goal is for iBubble to be as discreet as possible. iBubble adapts to the marine environment, not the other way around.</span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Will iBubble film in low light conditions?</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks to integrated LED lights, iBubble will capture quality video, with brightened colors.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>How will iBubble react to underwater currents?</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This is one of the areas we're focusing on at the moment (along with environmental impact and obstacle avoidance). iBubble is equipped with 8 engines and an inertial unit in order to counteract turbulences. It should be able to go to 3.2 ft/s max and 1.9 knots.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>How will the batteries work?</b></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">iBubble is equipped with a battery pack of 2 LiPo (lithium) batteries lasting up to 1h in standard conditions (10 to 30°C / 50 to 86°F, 15 min lights usage, 1 m/s – 3.2 ft/s max. current)</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span><span><span><b>What happens if iBubble runs out of battery?</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>We are aiming for a 1-hour battery life. When the battery will be nearly empty, iBubble will alert the diver with a set of LED lights. The diver will call iBubble back and hook it on his back. This will be particularly useful for drift dives. Another option will be for iBubble to resurface. This could be useful for longer dives.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><b>What if iBubble loses power or if there is an electrical failure in the water?</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>When the battery runs out, iBubble will come back to the diver and he will be able to finish the dive with it.  In case of a failure, iBubble is equipped by an emergency system that send it directly to the surface.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><b>How does the signal work underwater?</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iBubble “speaks” to the diver via a control bracelet, using Short Baseline (SBL). This is the same low-frequency positioning system used by submarines. We use low power, low frequency signal, which presents no danger to divers or fishes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><b>How does one carry iBubble on land?</b></span></p>
<p><span>We’re really proud of our design, which takes in consideration feedback from our community of divers. With convenient handles and weighing only 5kg (less than 11lbs), the drone is a breeze to transport on land.</span></p>
<p><span><b>How will you ensure filming quality?</b></span></p>
<p><span>iBubble’s IMU (inertial measurement unit) is very precise and will allow for great stability. The 7 engines also help stabilize the drone. </span></p>

<p><span>You will connect your phone, tablet or computer to your iBubble via Wifi or Bluetooth to upload and edit your video!</span></p>
<p><b><span>How should I take care of my iBubble?</span></b></p>
<p><span>Rinse it thoroughly with clear water after each dive and keep it in its case.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>6. ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY</b></p>
<p><b><span>What will be iBubble's impact on the marine ecosystem?</span></b></p>

We’re underwater world lovers. What we enjoy most is exploring the underwater world, taking in the beauty of the oceans. If you’re like us, you know how cool it is to share your diving experiences with people on land. But you also know how complicated filming can be, how it limits your freedom underwater – and freedom is why we dive in the first place.
With iBubble, we’re designing the first intelligent, user-friendly and completely autonomous diving drone. It gives you unprecedented possibilities to create underwater movies with your GoPro®. From scuba divers to freedivers, but also recreational snorkelers and spear fishers, everyone can enjoy iBubble! 







Thanks to our patented underwater localization technology, iBubble follows you and films entire diving sessions – without you having to do anything. It’s your own pilot fish, but with a camera and smarter.


iBubble opens a whole new (underwater!) world of filming opportunities. You will create shots that were, until today, only accessible with professional means: record what you see from a distance, follow and film yourself, orbit around you and many more. To make sure your footage is perfectly steady despite sudden movements or currents, iBubble will be stabilized. The cherry on top: we will add two 1000 lumen lights to increase image quality.
 





Some close-up shots require precise camera handling: an octopus hiding in a crack for instance. We’ve got that covered too – simply call iBubble back from your bracelet, grab it, switch to manual mode and use it as a regular underwater camera. Press the switch again, release iBubble and it’ll resume following you. 





Not sure what’s under the boat? If you’d rather scout unknown spots from the comfort of the boat before diving, you’ll love our remote control option. Plug it in, immerse iBubble and see for yourself if it’s worth getting wet.


 

The oceans are an awesome gift nature gave us. As respectful visitors of the underwater world, we want iBubble to be part of the solution. We’re designing a drone with minimal footprint, minimal noise and maximum regard for the marine environment. Not only that – we’ll also give 1% of our sales to nonprofit organizations fighting for cleaner oceans.

We started dreaming of iBubble in March 2015. Since then, we’ve refined the idea a lot, both in terms of functionalities and technical specs.
During the product definition stageWe’ve interacted with hundreds of people from the diving community (scuba divers, free divers, underwater movie professionals, scientists…). We’ve gathered user feedback from experts and amateurs. In fact, we’ve leveraged every single opportunity to meet and discuss with our future backers, from huge diving shows to Facebook or face to face meetings. Our motivation was simple: we absolutely needed to know what YOUR dream underwater camera would be. Because we believe that’s the only way to deliver a great product.
On the technical sideWe first identified the fields of expertise required to make iBubble work, from hydrodynamics to energy management, via signal processing and embedded software. We then developed a proof of concept (a real-life feasibility test to make sure our technical hypothesis are valid) on the most critical technological breakthrough: underwater positioning. Given that high frequency radio transmission, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth don’t work underwater, we had to find another way to ensure communication between the diver and the drone. We’ve looked at other industries and eventually found a solution mixing the best of marine mammals’ echolocation and computer-based tracking algorithms. For all other required functionalities, we’ve either considered technologies available off-the-shelf, and/or performed preliminary studies to check that we could meet our timeframe, quality and costs expectations. We’ve chosen to develop several prototypes and test our ideas in situ.


The technical prototype V5 ""Beluga"" you can see in the videos is our most advanced one in terms of functionalities. This prototype integrates ultrasonic transmitters that allow to detect the diver 360° around it. Thanks to the connected bracelet, the diver can change the camera angle scenarios or ask to resurface at the end of the dive.We also implemented a feature that greatly improves the accuracy of the shots: real-time video recognition. This technology opens many possibilities for the future.Great work has been done on the fluidity and the precision of the movements. We are now working on the integration of new scenarios such as the 360°.
The yellow prototype is a design mock-up. We wanted you to have an idea of how cool iBubble will look in the future. Its shape takes into account architecture constraints of all functionalities iBubble will have onboard in a slick, hydrodynamic design. Integrating the different technologies is a time-consuming phase, which should be complete at the end of this calendar year.

Regarding the braceletWe have already developed its critical functionality: the positioning system’s transmitter. You can see its first prototype handled by our diver in the Technical Prototype V5 video above. How does it work? The transmitter emits a low frequency signal that the drone uses to calculate its position relative to the diver. The antenna, battery and electronics included in this prototype seem bulky, but they are design to meet a >1 km (~1 mile) range requirement. Once they are scaled back to iBubble’s 25m/80ft range, they will fit in a dive computer.
We’ve also worked on the bracelet’s future design and user interface. You can see one of the previous rendering in the pictures below. In the future, it will also integrate a display to make it even simpler. To industrialize this bracelet, we will turn to a well-known dive computer manufacturer. Several of them have approached us, and we’ve decided that it would be more efficient to leverage their expertise. Backers updates will inform you regularly of our progress on this front.
What’s next? The product developmentWe’ve defined a robust methodology based on our extended experience in consumer goods industrialisation and high-end software development. We’ve already pre-selected key partners for both the development and the production phase. You’ll find the main steps of the industrialization process in the timeline below.


We’ve assembled an A-team of passionate divers, underwater world enthusiasts and people with the skills to turn our idea into reality: embedded software developers, manufacturing & supply chain managers for some of largest manufacturers, mechatronics experts, experienced business model designers and creative innovation marketers. We love what we do and do it well!
Our team members have completed projects ranging from critical software for commercial airliners to France’s best selling electric car or Hexo+, the world’s first autonomous flying camera. We’re also working with partners who are leaders in their fields, whether it’s launching startups or turning Indiegogo hopes into successful industrial projects.Why are we tooting our horn here? Because launching a product from scratch is a difficult process. And we certainly don’t want to mess it up. Truth be told, we want to go diving with iBubble as much as you do! Delivering a product too late or short on functionality is not an option for us.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Simple pleasures are my main focus.  I enjoy expanding my experience by interacting with people and the natural world around me.  My ambition is to help the world see the beauty that already exists, and if I can be a vehicle for that, then I will be able to die a happy man.</p>
<p>Most people know me as a simple person; I value experience over material acquisitions, relationships over associations, and fun over stress... which I believe most people would agree with. </p>
<p>I have been passionately shooting photos for the past 15 years.  I feel very fortunate to have found something that allows me to share some of the beauty I find in this world.  <br/></p>

<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>Last month my camera bag and all my gear was stolen.  I did not have insurance and lost everything.  I was just getting going with a blossoming photography career, and had received much encouragement from peers and family as having a good talent and eye.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/150602/files/20131023124154-the_white_wave.png?1382557314"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>So basically I need to raise money to get my gear, and am hoping by offering some good perks you will see the value in my work, and feel good knowing that by purchasing some good art that you will be helping someone get back to doing what they love.  My perks have two themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical artwork for your desk or wall that I hope you will enjoy - all photos are unmanipulated (except for some lightroom adjustments), but I do my best to keep the image to resemble what my mind's eye saw at that time.</li>
<li>Tutorials on photoshop and lightroom to help you increase your knowledge of these software programs to hopefully further your own photography pursuits.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact will be real:  you will help someone be able to get back doing what they love.  I am not a fan of loans and do not want to rely on the bank for this project.  Instead, I hope that I can do a bit of ""reverse selling"" where people can exchange money for some quality prints that will look great, or make for excellent gifts.  </p>
<p>The funds raised will go toward the purchase of a new camera body, lenses, tripod, bag, memory cards, and accessories.  Any additional money will be invested in gear, and if you know the photography game, it can get expensive.</p>

<p>I’m Aaron St. Bernard from Everything Is A Model. For years I’ve passionately photographed and documented numerous events I attended for coworkers, friends and family. I’m currently completing Digital Photography courses at George Brown College and I’m just about ready to begin my new career as a professional photographer.  I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada and I relish documenting the artistry in and around my city and cities around the world. I am fascinated by elegance and simplicity in everything around me and I believe that anytime is the perfect time for a photo shoot.  I intend to use photo journalistic style to cover events such as weddings, birthdays, graduations as well as concerts, fundraisers, and serious events such as demonstrations and protests in the streets. I will share these stories through digital media and hopefully through publication in the future.  More importantly I will be able to employ myself and hopefully help other amateur photographers start their own businesses to be independent.</p>
<p>Step 1, I need a new camera! Mine was stolen in Chicago (along with some great photos!), and this is why I need your help.</p>
<p>I’m purchasing a new laptop, and paying for the photography courses and I’m finding the cost of this plus a new camera overwhelming. I need to raise $1,500 to cover the cost of a Canon 60D camera and basic accessories. As such, I’m turning to my strongest supporters to ask for contributions.</p>
<p>In exchange for your generous contributions, I’m offering thank you’s, shout outs, love, photo prints, photo books, and photo shoot sessions! Check out the website <a href=""http://everythingamodel.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://everythingamodel.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>(If you prefer to recieve a print that isn't 8x10I'm willing to negotiate!)</p>
<p>All and any contribution amount will help me raise the target $1500, and further, it will help me launch a new career as a self-employed photographer!</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!  I'm creating this for my friend Scot who tragically and quite ironically ""lost"" his camera while in Jamaica shooting a wedding in November. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Let me give some background as to what happened:</p>
<p>Walking along the Jamaican beach, (with his camera of course...who wouldn't have their camera on them in Jamaica?  Anyway...) Scot was enjoying a beautiful afternoon when he spotted an entire schoolbus full of children struggling to swim in the water.  His concern turned to alarm as he saw the sharks beginning to circle and without a moment's hesitation he lept into the water and began to distract the sharks by throwing pieces of meat in the opposite direction of the children (which he conveniently had stored in his pockets) and then proceeded to pull the children out of the water with 4 hanging off of each arm.  In the process of this heroic gesture, his camera was repeatedly subjected to the salt water and after having it looked at, it is conclusively out of service.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Though this is what Scot may have told me, the real story was a lot less heroic and a lot more unfortunate.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a full-time photography student and freelance photographer his camera is an essential piece of who Scot is because of what he does.  In order to help Scot along I am hoping that those who know Scot and his photography will join in getting Scot a new camera.  Many of you have enjoyed Scot's photos and know what a loss this would be. Let's help out a friend during this season of giving!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So what does all this mean: Scot needs a new camera and would also like to continue pursuing photography school.  In order to do both Scot can't dip into the money allotted for school and this is where you and I come in. All of the money raised, whether the full amount needed is met or not, will go directly towards the purchase of a new camera and new lens (which was also ruined in the saltwater heroism).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Scot has always known that the community around him greatly affects and impacts his photography and in continuing to recognize this especially in this time of looking to others for support he would like to say thank you by offering some sweet perks for your giving.  Check out the list on the right to see what it's store for your support!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The more people that give the faster Scot will be back at shooting sweet pics!  If every Facebook friend of Scot's gives $2-$3 the goal will be met.  So don't be overwhelmed by what you might consider a large amount of money needed, instead lets make it small amounts of money from a large amount of friends.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As a young child I was given a neon yellow 110 camera (it was the 90's, everything I owned was neon. Don't hold it against me!). At age seven I won a local photography competition for a photo of seashells I took on our beautiful Maine coast. I haven't put the camera down since.</p>
<p>This campaign ends on my 29th birthday. I am one year away from 30 and this love of photography is still just a hobby. It's time to stop dabbling and get serious!</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get - The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help I can turn a lifetime love of art into a career and use my photographs to help pay for my college education. I am a writing major. I plan to combine my love of photography and my passion for writing into a career that has a positive impact on those around me.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in chronicling the changing world around us. We live in interesting times, and history is being made around us every day. I frequently attend rallies and political events, recording the faces of those changing our world. Recording our history.</p>
<p>I also believe good family photos aren't just portraits. I strive to put children at ease so that family photographs are pieces of art that show personalities instead of just smiling faces (no matter how beautiful those smiles are!)</p>
<p>The camera I currently own has begun to malfunction and no matter how many 2nd and 3rd opinions I get the experts all say it is time to retire her. My fundraiser will not bring enough money to buy a professional camera, but I hope to raise enough to buy a semi-pro camera (a Nikon) and then, with my hard work behind the lens, use that camera to raise the money for the camera I need to go pro.</p>
<p>If this campaign doesn't raise enough money the funds will go into a savings account which I will continue to add to until I can afford the camera my future goals require. Either way the money we raise together here will have a direct impact on my future career goals.</p>
<p>By donating to my campaign you are part of helping make my photography dreams come true. If you donate you have a place in my heart, which means you automatically get the friends/family rates when you decide you need photographic artwork! You can also earn free photo shoots and fine art prints.</p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<p>As a college student I know what it is like to be broke! I have eaten my fair share of Ramen. So if you can't contribute you can help in other ways. Like my Facebook page, Katrina Kent Photography. Spread the word about my IndieGoGo campaign. And no matter what, remember through art we can find peace, so support your local artists!</p>

<p><b>EDIT: Currently I am having technical difficulties getting the perks to show up in the right order, so I apologize if they're not in the ideal order right now. Everything else is working smoothly though.</b></p>
<p>Quick links:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.blurb.com/books/4694424-westward-we-go-free"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Westward We Go Free"" the book (preview)</a><br/><a href=""http://gofreephotography.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Print choices</a><br/><a href=""http://hollykerchneremail.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Email</a><br/><a href=""http://gofreeco.storenvy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Online shop</a><br/><a href=""http://hollykerchner.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Photography website</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>PLEASE READ IF YOU MAKE A PURCHASE: Quick Run-Down For Buying Prints</h3>
<p><b>All prints are printed on high-quality photographic paper by a professional printing company and are not matted or framed.</b><br/></p>
<p></p>If there is a specific print you want that in not on the page I provide, no problem! Shoot me an email at hollykerchner@gmail and we'll get it figured out.<p>For that matter, any kind of custom order is welcomed. Feel free to email me for inquiries or comments, I pride myself as a quick replier.</p>
<p>Okay. On to the nuts and bolts. The ideal procedure for buying a print is:<br/>1. Go to my <a href=""http://gofreephotography.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">print website</a>, pick which image(s) you want as a print, and identify the reference number for that photo. The reference number <a href=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/25271fc3e7b89952e11a5a5e41f8ca70/tumblr_mtazrkQxGI1qcfoiho1_1280.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">is listed under the image</a>.</p>
<p>2. Click on the perk, go about business as usual. But when you type in your shipping address, be sure to put the <b>number</b> of the print(s) you picked out <b>after your name</b>.<br/><b>Example:</b><br/>Holly Kerchner <b>61</b><br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">XXX Street<br/>City ST 00000</span></p>
<p><b>Alternatively, you can email me at hollykerchner@gmail.com with your name and the number of print you want, after you purchase the perk.</b></p>
<p><b>Alternatively to that, you can make a comment in the comments section <b>with your name and the number of print you want, after you purchase the perk</b></b></p>
<p><b>I want to make this as easy painless for you as possible, so choose what method works best for you.</b><br/></p>
<p>3. When I receive your contribution/order, I will see the number of the print you want and archive it along with your name and address. After the campaign ends I'll be sending your print along right away, so keep your eye out! (And of course the shipping address I use will have the random number removed, so we don't confuse the mailman!)</p>
<p>For efficiency's sake, my plan is to order and then mail the prints to you IMMEDIATELY after the campaign is over, on November 5.

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Hello! I am Holly Kerchner, a student and Montana native currently residing in Florida. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I first picked up a camera with serious ambition in June of 2011. More than anything, I wanted to capture natural beauty. I photographed dapples of light, hands, flowers, anything that emanated the magnificence of the seemingly ordinary. In the fall of 2011 I started shooting film photography. I would beg my mom to take me grocery shopping with her so I might sneak into the Sam's Club photo department and exchange my little plastic rolls for the grainy prints of clouds and plants that took my breath away.</span></p>
<p>Since then, I have had the honor of photographing more beauty than I even knew existed. The towering mountains of Southern Alaska. The heartfelt strumming of folk musicians in Northwest Montana. A perfect newborn being baptized in a dimly lit church.</p>
<p>I am eager for a tool that meets the challenges of capturing beauty exactly as it is, even in poor lighting conditions or other unfavorable circumstances. With the Canon 5D Mark II's incredible low-light capabilities and silent shutter mode, I would have at my fingertips an amazing resource for capturing breathtaking scenes in every possible situation.</p>
<p>This is a space for organizing print sales and accruing support as I strive towards earning money for my new camera, the Canon 5D Mark II. The focus of this campaign is not to ask for donations, but rather I am asking that you consider buying one of my <a href=""http://gofreephotography.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">photographs</a> to hold in your hands and possibly even adorn your wall. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>My Goal</h3>
<p>Even the tiniest amount helps. The Mark II costs $2,000+ for the body alone, and although as of September 20th, I have acquired a part-time job, I would like to proudly supplement those wages as much as possible with money that I've earned with my own art, which is not something everyone can say. Your participation in my reaching this goal means the world to me. I put so much love and thought into the photographs I take, and the possibility of those same photographs traveling through the mail and hanging on the walls of people everywhere would give me so much joy.</p>
<p>I also have an online shop, <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/GoFreeCo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Go Free Co</a>. I love creating things in my spare time, and in addition to handmade items you will find gently worn clothes, unique jewelry, old cameras, and other fun surprises. Naturally, all the proceeds from that shop also go towards my goal of buying the Mark II.</p>
<p>I also offer professional photography services. I love taking pictures for couples, families, seniors, and anyone else who is in need of a professional photographer. Examples of my client work can be seen <a href=""http://www.hollykerchner.com/client-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. <b>I also wanted to announce that until the end of this campaign on November 5, all of my client sessions are 25% off.</b> Please email me at hollykerchner.com if you want to book a session, ask a question, or just find out more about what kind of photography I offer.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything, guys! Have a lovely day.</p>

EDIT: Currently I am having technical difficulties getting the perks to show up in the right order, so I apologize if they're not in the ideal order right now. Everything else is working smoothly though.

PLEASE READ IF YOU MAKE A PURCHASE: Quick Run-Down For Buying Prints
All prints are printed on high-quality photographic paper by a professional printing company and are not matted or framed.
If there is a specific print you want that in not on the page I provide, no problem! Shoot me an email at hollykerchner@gmail and we'll get it figured out.For that matter, any kind of custom order is welcomed. Feel free to email me for inquiries or comments, I pride myself as a quick replier.
Okay. On to the nuts and bolts. The ideal procedure for buying a print is:1. Go to my print website, pick which image(s) you want as a print, and identify the reference number for that photo. The reference number is listed under the image.
2. Click on the perk, go about business as usual. But when you type in your shipping address, be sure to put the number of the print(s) you picked out after your name.Example:Holly Kerchner 61XXX StreetCity ST 00000
Alternatively, you can email me at hollykerchner@gmail.com with your name and the number of print you want, after you purchase the perk.
Alternatively to that, you can make a comment in the comments section with your name and the number of print you want, after you purchase the perk
I want to make this as easy painless for you as possible, so choose what method works best for you.
3. When I receive your contribution/order, I will see the number of the print you want and archive it along with your name and address. After the campaign ends I'll be sending your print along right away, so keep your eye out! (And of course the shipping address I use will have the random number removed, so we don't confuse the mailman!)
For efficiency's sake, my plan is to order and then mail the prints to you IMMEDIATELY after the campaign is over, on November 5. This is so that I am not sending a flurry of scattered orders to the printing company. Doing it this way will save a lot of time and shipping/handling. However, if for any reason you would like your print sent earlier, just shoot me an email at hollykerchner@gmail.com! This means that, as of right now, you will not be receiving your prints until the beginning of November, UNLESS you contact me asking for them sooner (because you need them for a birthday gift or something like that).
Depending on popular demand, I am definitely open to add more/different perks if you have any suggestions you want to make.If you want to order prints in bulk (5 or more), just shoot me an email and I will give you a bigger discount.

Slick is an innovative camera stabilizer, compatible with GoPro, that lets you capture smooth videos hands-free. Using standard GoPro mounts, you can attach Slick to any of your favorite accessories -- like a helmet, a pole, a dog, a chest mount, a drone or a surf board !
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

REDBULL : ""SLICK is a must have for the 2016 snow season!""
TECHCRUNCH : ""I played with a SLICK prototype in person. You can shake the stabilizer in every direction and the GoPro stands still. It’s quite impressive!""
ROBERT SCOBLE : ""You can see as you move SLICK around, it's keeping the camera rock-solid steady""
SLASH GEAR : ""Save your viewers the headache and the nausea with SLICK""

 We used our own expertise and gathered feedback from professional riders to provide groundbreaking features.

 
 
 

 
Since we're not all professional riders, we gave SLICK to our skiers friends. They used a single GoPro and a SLICK + GoPro for comparison:SLICK footage is so smooth that you can simply increase playback speed to get that awesome Hyperlapse effect. Below is some street/forest footage shot from a helmet facing backward in Paris:  
BUT WAIT, there's more... SLICK is also 100% WEATHERPROOF!
SLICK is suited for all your favorite action sports in rain or snow such as biking, sailing, skiing, snowboarding... and will provide amazing action shots!SLICK uses motors and sensors: each of the camera’s motorized three axes is driven by a micro-controller, so that the camera stays perfectly level regardless of the kind of terrain you're moving on.
SLICK is compact and very simple to use:
1) Attach your GoPro camera to SLICK
2) Attach SLICK into your favorite GoPro mount -- they are all compatible
3) Switch it on and kick off the action!
 
 
 
 

 

We decided to build SLICK for GoPro since it's the most popular (and arguably best) action camera.Whether you have a GoPro Hero, 3, 3+, 4, 5, Session4 and 5, you can attach it to SLICK and ride. It just works!  
 
 
Since the GoPro 4 Session is smaller, we will provide a small balanced case (white part) to shoot with your GoPro Session. Note : We haven't approved the use of the GoPro battery backpack, so we cannot tell you at the moment if it's compatible. Stay tuned for this info.As far as we can say, you will have to change SLICK'S battery at the same time as GoPro's battery. It's really consumer friendly ! Why buy an expensive 3-axis gimbal, when you can attach Slick to your drone?
Indeed, you will be able to use SLICK upside-down on any GoPro mount !

Slick is the world's first GoPro stabilizer designed for action sport. You will soon be able to pre-order a hard case to carry your GoPro gimbal everywhere.  
 
SLICK RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
 
SLICK's technology has been used on drones for several years. Drone pilots are really focused on adopting leading edge technology. As designers, engineers, and action sports lovers, we realized that each of the ten million GoPro users could benefit from this technology to capture smooth videos hands free. All they really needed was an innovative GoPro accessory to stabilize their cameras! 
After many iterations, our final design works perfectly and is now ready for mass-manufacturing. Will you help us bring SLICK into your hands? Check out the following rewards.
 
 

 
 

 
We’re now raising funds on Indiegogo to get SLICK into the hands of filmmakers as quickly as possible. Indiegogo is an amazing platform designed to accelerate innovative ideas like ours. After watching our sample videos, we hope you'll share our excitement about SLICK. Our prototype is fully functional, produces amazing footage, and we’re ready to move on to the next step. Thanks to your support, our manufacturer will be ready to start production at the end of the campaign. We're all  set to deliver a great product at an affordable price.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Thomas has been innovating in the UAV space for 5 years by improving camera stabilization systems for drones. With SLICK, he wants to brings this professional technology to the mainstream.
Kevin has worked as a product engineer modeling parts for Formula 1. He designed SLICK's hardware to be ready for manufacturing.
For Xavier, life is about experiencing the moment, being in nature, finding your own way, and living on the edge. He is SLICK's ambassador.

SLICK est équipé d'un GoPro mount, vous permettant de fixer SLICK sur n'importe quels accessoires ! Sur un casque, une perche,  une planche de surf ou encore un drone !

 

 
 
 
 
 

REDBULL : ""SLICK est l'accessoire indispensable pour la saison 2016!""
TECHCRUNCH : ""J'ai utilisé un prototype de Slick en personne. Vous pouvez secouer le stabilisateur dans toutes les directions et la GoPro reste stable. C'est vraiment impressionnant""
 
SLASH GEAR : ""Eviter le mal de tête et la nausée aux gens qui regardent vos vidéos""

Nous avons utilisé notre expertise et pris en compte le retour de plusieurs riders professionnels afin de vous procurer les fonctionnalités suivantes. 

Puisque nous ne sommes pas des riders professionnels, nous avons donné SLICK à nos amis skieurs. Ils ont utilisé une GoPro seule et SLICK + GoPro pour la comparaison:Les vidéos tournées avec SLICK sont tellement stables que vous pouvez simplement accélérer la vitesse de lecture pour obtenir un superbe effet d’Hyperlapse. Vous pouvez voir ci-dessous une vidéo tournée depuis un casque tourné vers l’arrière dans les environs de Paris.  
 
SLICK est équipé de moteurs et capteurs: Chacun des axes motorisés est commandé par un micro-contrôleur, afin que votre caméra reste parfaitement stable et ce peu importe le type de terrain où vous évoluez.  SLICK est compact et très simple d’utilisation.
1) Fixez votre GoPro sur SLICK
2) Attachez SLICK sur votre fixation GoPro préférée (Toutes les fixations sont compatibles)
3) Allumez SLICK et ridez !
 
 
Nous avons choisi de développer SLICK pour GoPro car c’est la action cam la plus populaire (et possiblement la meilleure!)
Peu importe que vous possédiez la GoPro 3, 3+, 4, ou 4 SESSION, vous pouvez la fixer à SLICK et commencer à filmer ! Ce n’est pas plus compliqué et ça fonctionne !
La GoPro 4 Session est plus petite. Nous fournissons un adaptateur (pièce blanche) afin d'utiliser la nouvelle GoPro. Note : Nous n'avons pas testé la compatibilité avec SLICK de la batterie additionnelle sur la GoPro, bientôt une news la dessus !Ce que nous pouvons dire est que vous devrez changer la batterie de SLICK en même temps que celle de la GoPro ce qui est très pratique ! 
Pourquoi achetez une nacelle hors de prix, lorsque vous pouvez attacher SLICK directement sur votre drone ?
En effet, vous pouvez fixé SLICK à l'envers sur n'importe quel support GoPro.

<p>My name is Christina Nijim, I am a 26 year old aspiring Palestinian Filmmaker.</p>
<p>I was born in a small city in the west bank called “Ramallah”. I was raised under war and occupation all life through, but living in such a dark reality helped me embrace the darkness in life but create my own light within. Photography was my outlet, and art was my surviving tool.</p>
<p>I have always dreamed of becoming a film maker, of entertaining people around the world with the most precious tool humans possess. The power of a film is infinite and timeless, but more importantly I want to reach out to human beings around the world who are going through hardships and unfair life circumstances, especially children paying the consequences of war and violence.</p>
<p>I want to put a smile on a face, to show people that no matter who you are , no matter where you come from, you can always dare to dream.</p>
<p>Always aspire to inspire.</p>
<p>This short film will portray the story of two Palestinian women who have a unique sense of humor and who survive in their harsh political reality by laughing, and by loving. This film will portray the power of a Palestinian woman, the uniqueness in how she handles hardships with an open mind but more importantly with an open heart. It is a simple story about finding beauty in the damage.</p>
<p>I chose to feature Palestinian talents, and Palestinian locations because I want to give integrity to the film but more importantly I want to give an opportunity for Palestinian talents to reach out and have an international platform where their voices can be heard. This will not only get me a step closer towards my dream, but it will carry on the dreams of other women and fresh talents who deserve a platform for their voices.</p>
<p>For the funding part, since I will be shooting in Palestine I will have limited supplies and connections. Due to the occupation and political restrictions there is no film industry in Palestine. There are no film companies or production companies that can fund and provide all the necessary tools for making a short film.</p>
<p> I will need a budget around 6000 dollars to at least get decent camera equipment, light equipment, production design, crafts and catering services, and to pay for the cast and crew members.</p>
<p>I need human beings who believe in the power of talent and the value of dreaming, who believe in a better future for humanity where war and oppression can be fought with art. I need individuals and companies to put faith in my talent and voice and to help me reach my full potential. This film will be screened in Warner Brothers studios in Los Angeles and it will be the first Palestinian film to ever be screened there. If I can show people that Palestinians are full of life and love, if I can infatuate them with my characters, I believe I will get a step closer towards creating an artistic platform in Palestine.</p>
<p>Anyone who contributes in making this film come to life will be contributing in building a new platform for the Palestinian youth to help them survive and resist through art instead of violence. You will be saving lives by providing much needed outlets for people going through war and the consequences of occupation.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Will Tanksley. I'm an Italian-American from the Hudson River Valley of New York. I attended Fordham University in New York City and earned a BA in fine arts specializing in photography and painting.</p>
<h3><strong>What I'm doing:</strong></h3>
<p>I have been living and photographing in the Philadelphia area for 2+ years, and have the same camera I learned on through my college years. (A beautiful Canon Rebel Xt). Cameras have made quite some progress since then. Most Iphones and Ipads now have comprable/better sensors and I find much of the work I do in low-light settings to be sub-par for this reason. As I attempt to make phorography more than just a passion or a hobby, I need to invest in this and other pieces of equipment to produce and print a better, more professional and polished image.</p>
<h3><strong>What I need:</strong></h3>
<p>My goal is the current price for Canon's <a href=""http://shop.usa.canon.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10051_10051_329737_-1?gclid=CPr10veKh7cCFQqi4AodKkUArQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EOS 6D</a>, which boasts one of the best low-light sensors. </p>
<p><strong>However,</strong> I realize that this investment for just one piece of equipment isn't wise. <strong>So,</strong> unless I exceed this goal, I am going to use the funds to buy a cheaper, but comprable alternativee, the <a href=""http://shop.usa.canon.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10051_10051_262753_-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EOS 60D</a> which is 700$</p>
<p>The rest of the funding will go to the rest of the equipment I need which includes:</p>
<p>lighting - parabolic reflectors and diffusers, a larger lightbox, angled and/or remote flash</p>
<p>gear  - new zoom lens, lens shade, extra battery pack, more backdrop colors, tripod, memory cards, and a new backup terrabyte drive</p>
<p>printing - I'd also like to start producing physical prints to frame and sell, as well as for headshots. This requires photo paper, ink, and of course, a high quality photo printer like <a href=""http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Product/UserReviews.do?sku=C11CB35201"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Epson's Stylus Photo R2000</a> which goes for 500$</p>

Street and portrait photography are my two biggest passions and my work has taken me all around the world. I am not a big fan of ‘staging’ my pictures, I’d rather capture the world around me as it is and use different techniques to put my unique spin on it. <br/>The 35mm focal length is ideal for this kind of photography. And I always use an f/8 aperture to achieve the best possible image depth. </p><p>So far, other lenses have always been either too bulky for me, or the autofocus took too long when trying to take a spontaneous photo. On top of that, most lenses don’t have an exact focus range. So I ended up missing out on a lot of photo opportunities. </p><p>This is how the idea of the CITOGRAPH 35mm was born. With its fixed focus, I am always ready to take instant, high-quality snapshots. The lens is also extremely compact – it easily fits into my bag and goes with me everywhere! And thanks to the large sensor, the CITOGRAPH takes amazing pictures even in low light.” </p><p>C.P.Goerz is a duly incorporated company in Atlanta Goergia.  The company has been newly formed and shares no legal obligations with the former C.P.Goerz in the US. The reason to form C.P.Goerz Inc. in the US was that it makes it easier for the US and international costumers, because we can offer our goods in Dollar and sthe costumer and the company have no currency risk.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504082580/rixcbumi2wuqhebhnyif.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504082608/ynkczopn38yb1wkovhzj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We have chosen a Tessar-type lens.

We’ve all been there: we spot something we’d love to photograph but by the time we’ve grabbed our SLR out of the bag, adjusted the focus and framed the shot, the moment has passed. Or we might use our smartphone to take a quick pic but the resolution just isn’t great.Our solution?We want to produce a professional-grade lens that will put the “Insta” back into Instagram! We want to bring the spontaneity back to photography while maintaining the highest standards of photo creation.The C.P. Goerz CITOGRAPH 35 is a revolutionary type of lens – the next big thing in photography. The angle of view corresponds with your natural viewing angle.Watch the world around you, take part and capture the crucial moment without hesitation or delay. No holding back: there are no mechanics in the lens to slow you down so you’re always ready to shoot. The CITOGRAPH 35mm is the world’s first ever hyperfocal citography lens, designed to capture a unique moment in time, just as YOU see it. The camera sees what you see. All you need to do is hold up your camera and snap away. Instantly. In the moment.  There is no autofocus, no zoom, no adjusting your aperture. Thanks to a fixed aperture and hyperfocal technology, everything from 3m to infinity is automatically in focus. The Tessar-type lens gives you great sharpness and is packed into a hyper-flat lens design that is both cool and innovative.The lens gives you endless opportunities to express yourself and create a personal photo diary of your surroundings as you experience them through your own eyes. Support our campaign to help us make this vision a reality.Citography is a completely new form of spontaneous and pure photography, allowing you to create beautiful and highly professional photos of the world around you – create images that are just as unpredictable and spontaneous as life around you.With the CITOGRAPH 35mm, you can truly express yourself and tell your very own story – from your own unique viewpoint, without compromising on image quality. It offers a creative freedom that has so far not been possible in photography.It is the perfect universal lens for this new way of documenting life – citography. With a focal length of 35mm, the possibilities are almost endless: it strikes the perfect balance between a standard-angle and wide-angle lens. And thanks to its hyperfocal technology, you can take stunning pictures of fast-moving objects – talk about capturing a fleeting moment!   About me“I’ve been working in photography for over 25 years. Street and portrait photography are my two biggest passions and my work has taken me all around the world. I am not a big fan of ‘staging’ my pictures, I’d rather capture the world around me as it is and use different techniques to put my unique spin on it. The 35mm focal length is ideal for this kind of photography. And I always use an f/8 aperture to achieve the best possible image depth. So far, other lenses have always been either too bulky for me, or the autofocus took too long when trying to take a spontaneous photo. On top of that, most lenses don’t have an exact focus range. So I ended up missing out on a lot of photo opportunities. This is how the idea of the CITOGRAPH 35mm was born. With its fixed focus, I am always ready to take instant, high-quality snapshots. The lens is also extremely compact – it easily fits into my bag and goes with me everywhere! And thanks to the large sensor, the CITOGRAPH takes amazing pictures even in low light.” C.P.Goerz is a duly incorporated company in Atlanta Goergia.  The company has been newly formed and shares no legal obligations with the former C.P.Goerz in the US. The reason to form C.P.Goerz Inc. in the US was that it makes it easier for the US and international costumers, because we can offer our goods in Dollar and sthe costumer and the company have no currency risk.We have chosen a Tessar-type lens. This lens construction is known for its sharpness but can also be built in a very compact manner which was key to our mission. It has the necessary basic sharpness and contrast required to create those expressive images.We made the lens super easy, no technical background is needed. But here is a little information on how to use it:Set your ISO setting to automatic and select “time automatic”. That’s it! You’re ready to go and create your own citography world. You won’t miss anything around you anymore. How is the color applied?By adding colored particles the specific colored look is obtained to last for a lifetime.. The Citograph 35 was developed by a german independent engineering firm according to our specificationsSpecs

<h2><strong>NOT JUST ANOTHER CAMERA RIG</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>CAMERA RIG + ELECTRONICS + PRICE + CONVENIENCE: This is not just another shoulder rig.  Traditionally, shoulder rigs such as old-fashion news style camera rigs are weighted pieces of metal mounted on your shoulder.  Those rigs are used <em>only</em> to stabilize the camera.  Our rigs are different.  One of the most unique aspects of our Get A Gripp camera stabilizer is that it has handgripps that have thumbwheels for focus/zoom; index finger triggers to turn video on and off; take stills; and take time lapse photography!  There are other great features our camera stabilizer comes with that no other rig has on the market.  Not only that, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to shoot great digital films, so we've worked hard to make this rig as cost effective as possible, plus, we've open-sourced everything.  Hack it, change it, reinvent it, show it (to us!). We will put your newly designed ideas up for everyone to use as open-source. We want to see more people making better films for less! Please check out the rest of our page for more details.  Happy Filmmaking!</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>What Cameras Are Compatible With Get A Gripp?</strong></h2>
<p>Our camera stabilizer works with practically all videoing devices - anything that has a threaded-base hole on it (most cameras).  We took a logic tester, caught the open-source codes from all the remotes (i.e. big camera companies such as Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Sony, and more).  It works with all DSLR cameras.  We're also working to mass produce a quick release base plate for your iPhone, Android, and handheld digital camera so you can mount your devices on our Get A Gripp.</p>
<h2>Ultimate Stability</h2>
<p>NEVER TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE GRIPS AGAIN. Our unique Genius Gripps have thumbwheels <em>and</em> triggers which make it so that you can focus/zoom, toggle video on and off, take still photos, and take time lapse photography without ever having to take your hands off the handgripps. Camera stabilizers on the market today have grips with no electronic control functionality, which means you have to take your hand off the grips in order to control the camera.  This causes the entire rig to shake, thus your footage will be unclear and shaky as well. Unless you're filming The Blair Witch Project Part 6, shaky footage is not at all desired.  Get A Gripp allows you to keep your hands as far from the center of mass as possible for ultimate stability.  </p>
<h2>Genius Gripps</h2>
<p>Our Genius Gripps allow you to interact with your camera in a way no other camera stabilizer on the market can.  Our Genius Gripps not only have all the features listed above, you will also be able to reprogram our smart little Gripp.  You can control anything with an infrared LED interface, or use our forthcoming servo finger to turn push buttons and rocker style switches on/off (like turning your light switches on/off with our Gripps)... So if you decide you want control the sound toggling on your camera for instance, we'll teach you in a few simple steps via an interactive online tutorial (think YouTube) so that you can decide how you want your Genius Gripps to think!</p>
<p><img alt=""Our Genius Gripps. LEFT: Our first rough prototype of the Gripp. RIGHT: 3-D printed finalized version."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7217/7377724086_6790ee32f5.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Genius Gripps""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Fits Like a Glove</h2>
<p>Our Get A Gripp camera stabilizers are made in such a way that you can tune and adjust both the electronics + modulation and the physical camera parts.  All the physical components including the shoulder pad, battery box, Genius Gripps, and more are adjustable so your rig is comfortable and suited to your needs. Again, you will be able to assign different tasks to your Genius Gripps, so you get the most out of your Get A Gripp.  </p>
<h2>Quick Release Philosophy</h2>
<p>We use bicycle style camlock quick releases on all the components. The Genius Gripps, the front hexagon (Hex Box as shown below in the photo) and the camera mount. The molded foam rubber shoulder pad has two small durable bungees, which hold it to the tube.  To pop it on tripod, just put the tripod's base plate on our Hex Box and then you can use a one inch piece of tube to mount the rig to your tripod no matter what type of camera you have.  There is nothing faster for setup, storage, and adjustment than our quick release system.</p>
<p><img alt=""Hex Box + quick release"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7211/7252467486_66accd75f2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Hex Box + quick release""/></p>
<h2>Build Your Own!</h2>
<p>You can move, adjust, and even make up new rigs for other gear with our Hex Box and tubes. Our camera stabilizer is dseigned to be so dynamic that you can easily break down the components and build a rugged jib pole, light stand, microphone holder, and more! Get A Gripp camera stabilizers and all its components allow you to create almost anything you need on a video shoot. Wanna make a slider for an odd sized setup? With six or eight of our Hex Boxes and one inch diameter tubes, you can quickly build up anything you can imagine! It's like a Legos set for inexpensive, high-quality filmmaking.</p>
<h2>No More Dead Weight (Battery Box)</h2>
<p>On most camera stabilizers, the counterweight is <em>just</em> dead weight.  Our 12 volt battery box not only acts as a counterweight (it sits behind your shoulder for optimal smooth footage), but it also acts as a charger for all your electronic devices.  Our battery box has a cigarette-lighter style car charge port and a mini USB charger port. You'll be able to charge devices such as your phone, laptop, or even your camera's battery if you are out and about filming for long periods of time. Plus, the silica gel 12v battery will run the camera stabilizer for over 8 hours! We are dedicated to making economically efficient gear for everyone, which means all the components on our stabilizer have multiple facets.</p>

<h2>""We're the Juggernaut, B$%&amp;#!""</h2>
<p>RUGGED! Our components such as the Hex Box, our Genius Gripps, and the camera mount are made up of a ABS-like plastic, which is tougher than nails in that they are able to sustain a lot of weathering/impact.  Watch our video below! On top of that, the Aircraft Grade Aluminum (black &amp; anodized) tubing which the rig is made up of can hold up to 200 lb. in bending load!</p>
<p><img alt=""Look how strong we are (the tubing &amp; Hex Box that is...)! Our aluminum tubes are light as a feather, but as strong as can be!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7098/7377752240_79de2ab9f4.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Look how strong we are!""/></p>
<p><img alt=""Here's another pic of us showing off our strong components!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5111/7377729808_bf5f086192.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Here's another pic of us showing off our strong components!""/></p>
<h2>Oh, By The Way!</h2>
<p>We also use 1 inch tubing for everything, so if you need to create something for your specific needs, you can just run to the hardware store to buy the tubing needed in your project and conveniently integrate it into your creation.  It's cheap and easy!   </p>
<h2>What if I already have a camera stabilizer?</h2>
<p>We have designed our components so that you can attach our Genius Gripps to anyone's camera rigs (yes, all the functions on our Genius Gripps will still work!). So, if you already have a perfectly fine camera rig/stabilizer (they're the same thing, remember!), then you can choose from the reward on the right that suits your needs! </p>
<h2>Here's the Plan (Homemade)!</h2>
<p>As you can see in the video, we have a functioning prototype (actually, we have more than just one...)!  In the spirit of keeping things local, we are planning on having our camera stabilizers sourced and put together all in the USA.  The costs of manufacturing our stabilizer in the US is actually quite cost effective, in case you were wondering! All of our materials come from different parts of the US.  We, ourselves make most of the components such as the Hex Box and Genius Gripps using a 3D printer we splurged on!  In this way, we are able to keep costs low, eliminate copy-cats, and making sure our final product is insanely great... Just for you!  We need your help with funding so we can start production!</p>
<div> </div>
<h2>Why is this project on Indie?</h2>
<p>Oh, you wonderful wonderful Indie community! Before launching our camera stabilizer idea on kickstarter, my friends and I had always given small pledges, but we had never thought of doing a campaign myself... Until we came up with this idea. We have spent much of our own money developing this project; Bill wants to start a family soon; Jenni is in college; and we have several other (what we think to be) awesome ideas on the backburner which we'd really like to share with you!  So... Please help support us through our crazy endeavor.  By backing our project, you are telling us how awesome you think our idea is!  If you like our idea and want to see us go further with our stabilizer, please select from one of the backer options on the right hand side of the screen. We want to be able to start producing our stabilizers, so you can start making movies. We need your help to complete our project! Give us a kick, so we can start...</p>
<p>P.S. Check out our other ideas which we'd like to share with you at a future date!</p>
<p>• Servo Finger to turn your non-infrared LED activated device (zoom recorder, a push button on a monitor screen or labtop, or even a house light switch).  </p>
<p>• iPhone/Android digital base plates for the steady cam and stabilizer</p>
<p>• full-blown vest-mounted DSLR steadycam at a price lower than anyone elses</p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there lived three people who loved to shoot videos.  We got really frustrated with really wobbly shaky footage because we had to take our hand off the grip to control focus/zoom or other simple tasks like turning the camera on/off. We really want to keep the camera as steady as possible. Light bulb moment! So we said,""Why can't we program a little open source microproccessor to run a servo, both for focus/zoom, plus, we'll put some triggers on the grips to turn the camera on/off? This way, we don't have to take our hands off the grip, which allows for ultimate stability. Not only that, the servo will pull focus way more smoothly than any human hand ever could achieve. We also wanted to be able to take time lapse photography ...""  We had a few more (what we think to be) awesome ideas.  We wanted to materialize our creativity and produce a camera stabilizer that would help everyone make superb digital films.  We hope you agree with us! Please join us in our crazy endeavor to bring affordable, professional grade camera gear to all of you.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Meet the other 2 members of our team (Bill &amp; Lionel)!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8021/7377843992_ae160d5691.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Bill and Lionel""/></p>
<h2>Credibility</h2>
<p>In case you were wondering, we are not just a bunch of goobers! I know, hard to believe, right?  Lionel has multiple degrees, among which include an electrical engineering degree, a journalism degrees, and a business &amp; economics degree!  He's had his own science channel on YouTube, where he introduces a lot of really interesting, revolutionary technology.  Not only that, Lionel is also a airplane mechanic (he built his own plane!).  So, if you're having any doubts aout our stabilizer, please don't worry!  Bill has a degree in photography and history.  Bill is a master when it comes to electronics (think arduino) and is very inventive.  Lionel and Bill are both pilots, so working on large-scale electronic/mechanical projects is a piece of cake for these guys.  Jenni (that's me who is writing!) is more the people-person... I am studying economics and sociology as Mount Holyoke College.  I was also featured in an upcoming documentary called Somewhere Between - so being in front of and behind a camera is quite familiar to me!  We hope this eases your worries about our creation.  </p>

What if I already have a camera stabilizer?
We have designed our components so that you can attach our Genius Gripps to anyone's camera rigs (yes, all the functions on our Genius Gripps will still work!). So, if you already have a perfectly fine camera rig/stabilizer (they're the same thing, remember!), then you can choose from the reward on the right that suits your needs! 
Here's the Plan (Homemade)!
As you can see in the video, we have a functioning prototype (actually, we have more than just one...)!  In the spirit of keeping things local, we are planning on having our camera stabilizers sourced and put together all in the USA.  The costs of manufacturing our stabilizer in the US is actually quite cost effective, in case you were wondering! All of our materials come from different parts of the US.  We, ourselves make most of the components such as the Hex Box and Genius Gripps using a 3D printer we splurged on!  In this way, we are able to keep costs low, eliminate copy-cats, and making sure our final product is insanely great... Just for you!  We need your help with funding so we can start production!
 
Why is this project on Indie?
Oh, you wonderful wonderful Indie community! Before launching our camera stabilizer idea on kickstarter, my friends and I had always given small pledges, but we had never thought of doing a campaign myself... Until we came up with this idea. We have spent much of our own money developing this project; Bill wants to start a family soon; Jenni is in college; and we have several other (what we think to be) awesome ideas on the backburner which we'd really like to share with you!  So... Please help support us through our crazy endeavor.  By backing our project, you are telling us how awesome you think our idea is!  If you like our idea and want to see us go further with our stabilizer, please select from one of the backer options on the right hand side of the screen. We want to be able to start producing our stabilizers, so you can start making movies. We need your help to complete our project! Give us a kick, so we can start...
P.S. Check out our other ideas which we'd like to share with you at a future date!
• Servo Finger to turn your non-infrared LED activated device (zoom recorder, a push button on a monitor screen or labtop, or even a house light switch).  
• iPhone/Android digital base plates for the steady cam and stabilizer
• full-blown vest-mounted DSLR steadycam at a price lower than anyone elses
Our Story
Once upon a time, there lived three people who loved to shoot videos.  We got really frustrated with really wobbly shaky footage because we had to take our hand off the grip to control focus/zoom or other simple tasks like turning the camera on/off. We really want to keep the camera as steady as possible. Light bulb moment! So we said,""Why can't we program a little open source microproccessor to run a servo, both for focus/zoom, plus, we'll put some triggers on the grips to turn the camera on/off? This way, we don't have to take our hands off the grip, which allows for ultimate stability. Not only that, the servo will pull focus way more smoothly than any human hand ever could achieve. We also wanted to be able to take time lapse photography ...""  We had a few more (what we think to be) awesome ideas.  We wanted to materialize our creativity and produce a camera stabilizer that would help everyone make superb digital films.  We hope you agree with us! Please join us in our crazy endeavor to bring affordable, professional grade camera gear to all of you.  

Credibility
In case you were wondering, we are not just a bunch of goobers! I know, hard to believe, right?  Lionel has multiple degrees, among which include an electrical engineering degree, a journalism degrees, and a business & economics degree!  He's had his own science channel on YouTube, where he introduces a lot of really interesting, revolutionary technology.  Not only that, Lionel is also a airplane mechanic (he built his own plane!).  So, if you're having any doubts aout our stabilizer, please don't worry!  Bill has a degree in photography and history.  Bill is a master when it comes to electronics (think arduino) and is very inventive.  Lionel and Bill are both pilots, so working on large-scale electronic/mechanical projects is a piece of cake for these guys.  Jenni (that's me who is writing!) is more the people-person... I am studying economics and sociology as Mount Holyoke College.  I was also featured in an upcoming documentary called Somewhere Between - so being in front of and behind a camera is quite familiar to me!  We hope this eases your worries about our creation.

But fiddling with the dials and all the little details is not. Rather than rooting through your camera’s forbidding menu, with the Cubic Trigger app the preset modes are only a flick away. Just set it and forget it, and Cubic Trigger will do all the legwork for you, leaving you to enjoy the scene around you. But don’t worry about your phone being tied down; Cubic Trigger can run in the background, keeping your phone free to make calls or surf the internet while you wait for your masterpiece to come to life. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513928402/x83fzo5kipcpqrqyr1be.png"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Keep Your Eye On The Prize</h3><p>One of the guiding principles when designing our app was to allow the photographer the freedom to focus on the subject instead of operating his or her phone. To this end, we made the function as natural as possible with a simple press, drag, and release action.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513930374/bnwaau3mcfizsmu1p0bq.png"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PUJrS2FSHw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><h3>The Basics</h3><p>Despite all this functionality we didn’t forget the simplest things a camera can do. With basic mode, you can take a single shot, set a self-timer, and control exposure time. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513936240/g0ecmbwiobmypoganguu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Two Methods Of Dealing With Tricky Lighting -- HDR</h3><p>Two methods of dealing with tricky lighting: Shooting a subject with huge variations in brightness can sometimes be a headache, but we came up with two painless solutions: pre- and post-exposure manipulation. First, bracket mode will take a series of photographs with different brightness settings and stitch them together to form one optimal HDR photo.</p><p>For our second solution, we’ve taken the guesswork out of dodging and burning (as called as <i><strong>black card photography</strong></i>). Using only a black card, you will now be able to do this advanced photographic technique by yourself. The Cubic Trigger app will calculate the best exposure time based on input from the photographer and at the appropriate time will sound an alert to remove the card from the frame. This saves you from having to buy expensive filters for shooting high contrast scenery.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513935551/l1h44tuxr00btmqppg9j.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>You can find the technigue guides of black card photogrphy on youtube. </p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=black+card+photography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=black+card+photography</a></p><h3> </h3><h3>Time-lapse And Star Trail</h3><p>Cubic Trigger can easily handle time-lapse photography, even up to very long exposure times. Time-lapse can also be coupled with bracket mode to take HDR photos for HDR time-lapse videos. </p><p>The star trail function is another incredibly useful setting. When set to this mode, Cubic Trigger will take a series of long exposure shots which turn the stars in the sky into long streaking lights. The series is then stitched together to form one cohesive image.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513928603/zucfaj0szxnwmz6nlxpz.png"" src=""""/></h3><h3> </h3><h3>Lighting Reflexes</h3><p>Because sometimes your trigger finger is not quick enough to capture the action, we designed a sound trigger mode into Cubic Trigger that will keep an ear out for any noises that may mean something exciting is going on. It’s also useful as a remote trigger when taking selfies, group photos, or anything else you can think of. Now when you say “cheese!” it will really mean something!</p><h3>Scheduled Photos</h3><p>Become the master of time with the schedule photos mode. What would you do if there were a solar eclipse happening right over your town but your boss won’t let you take the day off? Cubic Trigger’s got you covered. You can set a date anytime up to 7 days in advance and your new photo sidekick will make sure you don’t miss the big event.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513929262/z44zqjki7nz4jj7hsjkv.png"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Keeping Tabs On Your Location</h3><p>With the geo-tagging function you’ll always know just where your photos were taken. This <u>Nikon-only</u> feature will update your coordinates and send them from your phone to your camera once a minute. And with GPS and A-GPS, even when taking photos indoors you won’t need to worry about your GPS receiver losing signal. </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513929759/uzwhtg1tyx0j3zelst54.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>Geotagging function demo on iOS with a Nikon camera indoor.</p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

The Android and iOS apps are now both up and available for download. But for the final step, we need your help. </p><p> </p></div>","Smartphone AppsLeave The Details To The DevicePhotography is fun! But fiddling with the dials and all the little details is not. Rather than rooting through your camera’s forbidding menu, with the Cubic Trigger app the preset modes are only a flick away. Just set it and forget it, and Cubic Trigger will do all the legwork for you, leaving you to enjoy the scene around you. But don’t worry about your phone being tied down; Cubic Trigger can run in the background, keeping your phone free to make calls or surf the internet while you wait for your masterpiece to come to life.  Keep Your Eye On The PrizeOne of the guiding principles when designing our app was to allow the photographer the freedom to focus on the subject instead of operating his or her phone. To this end, we made the function as natural as possible with a simple press, drag, and release action.  The BasicsDespite all this functionality we didn’t forget the simplest things a camera can do. With basic mode, you can take a single shot, set a self-timer, and control exposure time.  Two Methods Of Dealing With Tricky Lighting -- HDRTwo methods of dealing with tricky lighting: Shooting a subject with huge variations in brightness can sometimes be a headache, but we came up with two painless solutions: pre- and post-exposure manipulation. First, bracket mode will take a series of photographs with different brightness settings and stitch them together to form one optimal HDR photo.For our second solution, we’ve taken the guesswork out of dodging and burning (as called as black card photography). Using only a black card, you will now be able to do this advanced photographic technique by yourself. The Cubic Trigger app will calculate the best exposure time based on input from the photographer and at the appropriate time will sound an alert to remove the card from the frame. This saves you from having to buy expensive filters for shooting high contrast scenery.  You can find the technigue guides of black card photogrphy on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=black+card+photography Time-lapse And Star TrailCubic Trigger can easily handle time-lapse photography, even up to very long exposure times. Time-lapse can also be coupled with bracket mode to take HDR photos for HDR time-lapse videos. The star trail function is another incredibly useful setting. When set to this mode, Cubic Trigger will take a series of long exposure shots which turn the stars in the sky into long streaking lights. The series is then stitched together to form one cohesive image. Lighting ReflexesBecause sometimes your trigger finger is not quick enough to capture the action, we designed a sound trigger mode into Cubic Trigger that will keep an ear out for any noises that may mean something exciting is going on. It’s also useful as a remote trigger when taking selfies, group photos, or anything else you can think of. Now when you say “cheese!” it will really mean something!Scheduled PhotosBecome the master of time with the schedule photos mode. What would you do if there were a solar eclipse happening right over your town but your boss won’t let you take the day off? Cubic Trigger’s got you covered. You can set a date anytime up to 7 days in advance and your new photo sidekick will make sure you don’t miss the big event. Keeping Tabs On Your LocationWith the geo-tagging function you’ll always know just where your photos were taken. This Nikon-only feature will update your coordinates and send them from your phone to your camera once a minute. And with GPS and A-GPS, even when taking photos indoors you won’t need to worry about your GPS receiver losing signal. Geotagging function demo on iOS with a Nikon camera indoor.

</div></div>","** Video above shows a recent story i have covered in Bangladesh. *** Since ""EMERGING FROM THE ASHES"" is a new story, I was not able to display any image/video yet. Sorry! 


ABOUT ME

          I am a Spanish
photographer currently based in Hong Kong. I am described as curious,
impatient and stubborn. These characteristics have helped me persevere in some
of the most difficult story gathering, waiting for that particular moment,
where my captured image tells the story. 

To be a photographer helps me to perceive the world
not as how it is but the way it is lived in the places I go to, without
boundaries to enable me to comprehend my surroundings, to respect other
cultures and their way of thinking. Photography helps me to discover new
horizons and to value our present as a historical event.

I firmly believe that each
person has his/her own unique story, therefore, each of us has a fascinating
story to tell.

      Prizes & Nominations:


       2011 - International Photography Awards (IPA): 1st place for Photo Essay.       2011 - International Photography Awards (IPA): Honorable mentions.       2011 - Festival EMERGENT-LLEIDA (Spain): Finalist author of the Pati de la Llotja.       2011 - WPGA - Pollux Awards: 1st and 2nd prize (May - Humanitarian documentary).       2011 - Manuel Rivera-Ortiz Foundation: Hall of Excellence.       2011 - Photon Festival scholarship: Winner.       2011 - Sony World Photography Awards: Commended.       2010 - Sony World Photography Awards: Finalist.       2009 - Photographer´s Forum Magazine Contest: Finalist.       2008 - National Geographic contest (Spain’ territory): Finalist.       2008 - Boston, USA - BPPA Photography contest: 1st and 3rd place.       2008 - Photographer´s Forum Magazine Contest: Finalist.


THE PROJECT





        The small republic of Timor Leste has undergone countless
upheavals and changes in the last 30 years since Portuguese control over the
territory was lost to Indonesia and less than a decade ago, it had to
go through one difficult process of independence. In the last decade alone, the
birthing pains of a new republic, a society that is finally rid of its colonial
masters is still struggling to a point of bloodshed.
 
The country maybe poor, subject to a United Nations observation &
monitoring team but it said to be lying in one of the very few last rich oil
fields in the world. Scarred and battered through the years of civil chaos, the
struggling government is still beset with countless and numerous problems in
building a nation, in making an identity as a people and ably managing
resources ripe for exploit.
 
East Timor is a test case, perhaps one of the very last few nations in
the world during this modern era to build for itself an identity as a nation,
blended in the farthest corner of Southeast Asia, in a region dominated by
Muslim countries.
 
Documenting the changes and developments of Timor Leste at this stage
will serve as the point in time wherever the nation will proceed, from current
dismal state or to one of Asia’s roaring tigers. Part of the investigation
is to cover the crimes, mistakes and problems besetting the young republic and
what future lies for the rest of its people.
 
NGOs, government bodies, local journalists and individuals are among
potential contacts that can help me get the goal of picturing a very little
known country and the troubles it faces because of the still blurred crimes
against humanity that happened there.


WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
ALL FUNDS (minus Indiegogo's administrative fee) will go directly toward finishing the project. $2,800 does not pay for everything ( Accommodation, food, etc), but can cover the following costs:

WHAT DO YOU GET

Covering Timor Leste is an opportunity
to document in photographs for future generations what is happening to the
young Republic. Its centuries old history struggling to establish itself as an
independent and sovereign nation brings so much interest for the future.

The nation is rapidly transforming
itself and building a society after decades of war, first struggling against
the Portuguese and later against . The project will enable
countless interest organizations access to images of the present before the
nation transforms itself to possibly one of the dynamic nations of  and the Pacific basin.
 
The photos can be shared to other
projects and groups, that can be utilized for other informational purposes
other than posterity and remembrance. There are possibilities that the photo
documentary could be published and shared in general circulation traditional
media.
 
The materials will also be stored and
shared in my personal website, Facebook and Vimeo for others to witness real
time the story of the people of Timor Leste including updates on Twitter.

<h3>About the Film and Cast...</h3>
<h3>Ice The Movie was imagined by professional figure skater, and actress Maddison Bullock. In addition to Bullock, the film stars several former professional figure skaters, hockey players, as well as current elite level sectional and regional champions. The authenticity of its cast makes Ice The Movie a truly one of a kind Ice Skating Feature Film. The cast also includes Emmy Nominee and star of the hit series '24', Gregory Itzen, Mike C. Manning, star of the Disney Chanel Original Movie 'Cloud 9', and Patrick O'Brien Demsey star of the Disney's 2004 Ice Hockey spectacular, 'Miracle'. </h3>

<h3>What We Need... </h3>
<p>After a month on location in gorgeous Centennial and Winter Park, Colorado we are now 75% complete. This is in large part due to the generosity of the local businesses and skating clubs that facilitated our production needs with a level of enthusiasm and kindness we could never had anticipated. With their assistance we find ourselves now entering the final stages of filming and will be headed into post-production shortly thereafter! This is a very exciting time however we still have lots of work ahead and need your help! </p>
<p>* In order to fairly pay our hard working cast and crew for pick-up shots in LA, as well as pay for proper equipment and locations we need approximately $2,000</p>
<p>*Afterwards, to make the movie sparkle for the big screen post-production will incur a considerable expense, for example:</p>
<p>Renting a professional quality sound studio (approx. $3,000)</p>
<p>Hiring a professional quality colorist to make every frame beautiful and conform our final file (approx. $5,000)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ice The Movie seeks to instill in young athletes, those both novice and senior, the priceless values of character, teamwork, and integrity both on and off the ice. Although the film's core messages can be of value to both boys and girls we believe it to be of particular influence to young women as the narrative's two powerful female leads express strength, determination, passion, and camaraderie in an another-wise cold, and hyper-individualistic  arena. </p>
<p><strong>Popularity and promise for the future...</strong></p>
<p>Of the 25 most popular sports movies of all time 3 films that centered around the stories of strong female athletes made the list- Million Dollar Baby (14) A league of their own (21) Bend it like beckham (24). 2 of the other films on the list where hockey films slap shot (13) and the film that Ice’s writer was largely inspired by, Miracle (11) </p>
<p>According to Business Insider Figure Skating was the most talked about Winter Olympic Sport during the first week of the Olympics in 2014 in the most number of Countries. With the 2018 Winter Olympics just around the corner, and Ice The Movie holds promise as not only a fan favorite, but it has the potential to become an iconic, sports classic. </p>

<h2><strong>About me<br/></strong></h2>
<p>My name is Benjamin Zank. I'm 21 years old and a recent graduate from SUNY Purchase with a major in journalism. My hobbies include photography, photography, and photography.</p>
<p>On my last day of college, I dropped my Canon 5D Mark II into a swamp while on a routine shoot in the woods for my 365 project. My dinky little tripod just wasn't enough to balance it out, and by some stroke of horrible luck my camera will just not take a picture and the autofocus on my lens is unresponsive.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for YOU to get quality prints of images that I've spent hours on and have even risked my safety, and at the same time provide me with the right equipment that will allow me to continue my 365 project and beyond, enabling me to create even more mind-blowing photographs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How your contributions will be spent!</h3>
<p>I've set a goal of $4000. Reaching this goal will allow me to purchase a new 5D Mark II ($1500~$1700), a weather resistant, high quality 50 mm 1.2 L lens ($1450), and a super sturdy tripod (~$300). that leaves me with roughly $550 for printing and shipping expenses.</p>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p><strong>$10~$175 </strong>Prints, prints, prints! You will be getting prints from freshly shot concept with my new camera of sizes as large as 16x20!</p>
<p><strong> $350</strong> I will interpret your dreams/ideas through a photograph and feature it in my 365. You will receive creative credit for the image, and last but certainly not least: I will send you a signed and dated 16X20 or 20X20 print of the image. IT WILL NEVER BE PRINTED OR SOLD TO ANYONE ELSE. EVER. This is a personal collaboration between you and me.</p>
<p><strong>$500</strong> I will visit you anywhere in <strong>New York City</strong> for a portrait shoot. You will be featured in my 365 project. You will receive a 20x24 signed and dated print of one of the images taken.</p>
<p><strong>$750</strong> I will meet you anywhere in <strong>New York City</strong> for an all day hands on workshop and together we will create and edit YOUR photos. I will teach you everything I know from lighting to Photoshop techniques. I'll also take you to my favorite Chinese restaurant for noodle soup.</p>
<p><strong> *please add $10 for international shipping and handling for prints larger than 8x10*</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>If I don't reach my goal...</h3>
<p>I know I've set an ambitious goal, but every bit still counts. If I can raise even just $1000, I will be very close to being able to afford another camera, just no lens or tripod.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Either way, I want to thank all of you for supporting me and taking the time to look at my work. It really means the world to me!</strong></p>

<p>Panoramas become much easier to shoot with LUMI ELFI. Its <span><strong>built-in tilt meter</strong> </span>guides you to find the optimal angle to take a <span><strong>seamless 360°</strong> </span>of your surrounding. When the meter reads green, all you do is press the Panorama icon button and let LUMI work its magic. No weird stretches, glitches, merges and curves - just a clean, crisp shot of the view around you.</p>

</div></div>","This is LUMI ELFI, the next-gen selfie grip that combines the convenience of a smartphone camera with the versatility of a DSLR. Make any mobile picture and video look professional by slapping on LUMI ELFI. 
No more lugging around heavy camera equipment or spending thousands on other devices with redundant features. Just you, your phone, and LUMI ELFI are all you're going to need to make that next viral content!





 

 
 The Auto Face Tracking feature detects your face and motion so that the camera smoothly follows you when you move out of frame. Instead of limiting your range of motion to fit in the small mobile screen, LUMI ELFI gives you the freedom to capture movement with no interruptions to your natural flow.
This feature comes especially in handy when you want to film or shoot vertically. Vertical videos have become the new standard on major social media platforms like Instagram and Tik Tok, so using LUMI ELFI unlocks endless possibilities to shooting in that vertical frame.
Whether you want to live-stream a cool recipe in the kitchen, make a travel vlog, or finally film that new TikTok dance you've been practicing, this feature provides unparalleled convenience for any independent creative.




 
 
Panoramas become much easier to shoot with LUMI ELFI. Its built-in tilt meter guides you to find the optimal angle to take a seamless 360° of your surrounding. When the meter reads green, all you do is press the Panorama icon button and let LUMI work its magic. No weird stretches, glitches, merges and curves - just a clean, crisp shot of the view around you.
 

 

 
Thanks to LUMI ELFI's premium panoramic technology, you can even experiment with cloning illusions! The difference in quality truly shows when you try to get creative.
 

 




 

 

 

 

 
The Auto Motion Timelapse feature gives you ultimate satisfaction in capturing the best sunset, cityscape, or any other breathtaking view. It offers various speed options (4x, 8x, 12x, 20x, 40x), giving you more control to create your desired shot, and enough power to film up to an hour's worth of footage. 
LUMI ELFI's structured build also allows you to use it as a sturdy mount. Place it on a flat, even surface and you'll find your shot looking like you used a DSLR and a tripod. Quality results without the hassle.




 


 


 


 
LUMI ELFI's built-in control panel allows you to adjust the camera angle and zoom functions, the option to capture a picture or video, and whether to shoot from your front or back camera - all conveniently in one hand. 
Unlike most regular selfie sticks that make you retract your arm to fix the camera and then extend back to capture, LUMI ELFI lets you adjust everything with intuitively-placed buttons. So it's like you get the full control of a DSLR but on an easy-to-use mobile camera. 



 
This design went through multiple prototypes to satisfy that feeling of fitting perfectly in your hand. Not too big, not too small - just the right, substantial size. The control panel's buttons are then all located within a single thumb's reach, giving you comfortable access to all of LUMI ELFI's wondrous features.

 

 
When most selfie sticks are not stable enough to guarantee your phone's safety while out and about in dynamic situations, LUMI ELFI's silicone-covered clips put your anxiety to rest. They keep your camera securely locked and rolling even in the most energetic photographer's hands.
 

 

 
LUMI ELFI can extend up to 14 in. (360mm), but it is also compact and light enough to keep in your back pocket, fanny pack, or backpack when contracted. It is your trusty travel buddy and high-grade camera tool to whip out whenever and wherever.
 
Add on the Lumi Tripod for extra stability! More details below.

 


 

 
 
Simply download the LUMI ELFI app, available for both iOS and Android, and pair LUMI via Bluetooth to have all features and more available in seconds. A quick tap into the app gives you access to several shooting modes as well as an editing suite that lets you fine-tune your content to your taste.
Plus, instant wireless connection means you can do all that without draining any battery from your actual phone. LUMI ELFI lets you save your battery life for what's actually important.

 
 


All pictures taken with LUMI ELFI.







 
In the package you receive, you'll see LUMI ELFI itself, a micro USB cable to charge the device, and a user manual that provides an in-depth explanation of LUMI ELFI's many capabilities and features. 



 
LUMI ELFI comes in two colors: Clear White and Bold Black. Either neutral tone easily coordinates with any outfit and occasion. Just choose your personal preference!

 


 

 


 A worldwide operation with offices in Hong Kong and China, Kinofi is staffed by an international group of experts, dreamers, and gadget lovers.
Our desire to fuel creativity pushes us to be creative ourselves. With your help and backing, the brand new technology employed in the Kinofimount will be just the first of our dreams to come true. Our team is hard at work developing more innovative audio-visual solutions for the future.
Born from the question, “Why is my phone so smart and my selfie stick so stupid?”, the founders realized that there had to be a smarter and more affordable way to take great pictures and create engaging content.
Our innovative design and technology has been built upon years of investment, time and energy. We have gained popular recognition in the manufacturing field of mobile phones and cameras in Asia and have been acknowledged with multiple awards such as Hong Kong ICT Award and POLYU Tech Launchpad Fund Award.
To protect our proprietary innovations and inventions, we currently own 45 patents for our unique design and advanced technology, so you can be sure that our LUMI ELFI will be the most unique, advanced, and cutting-edge device for you and your photography needs.

It is a portable and user friendly device that is able to dive up to 100 meters depth and take high quality 16 Mega pixels photos &amp; 4K videos in full HD.</li></ul><p><strong>Who created Gladius? </strong></p><ul><li>Chasing-Innovation Technology Co. Ltd</li></ul><p><strong>Why should I use Gladius? </strong></p><ul><li>At an affordable price, the Gladius allows you to enjoy the filming and exploring in 100 meters depth underwater. Whether you are diving, fishing, island hopping or exploring, the GLADIUS is an excellent tool for you.</li></ul><p><strong>What are the differences between Gladius Standard and Advanced? </strong></p><ul><li>There’re several different features as follows: Camera: 4K for Advanced, 1080P for Standard; Horizontal Operation Range: 500 meters for Advanced, 30 meters for Standard; SD card capacity: 32G for Advanced, 8G for Standard.</li></ul><p><strong>How deep can the Gladius dive</strong>? </p><ul><li>For both the Standard and Advanced models, Gladius can dive up to 100 meters / 328 feet.</li></ul><p><strong>Why does Gladius use wired connection? </strong></p><ul><li>Radio waves don't travel well through water (especially at deeper depths). Thus, the semi-tether system that we have created. The drone is connected by a tether to the a Wifi enabled buoy. You connect to the buoy via the smartphone remote controller. We have optimized the tether’s weight and diameter to make it easy to carry and use, but not impeding on user experience. Moreover, we see the tether as a huge benefit. If anything happens to your drone during a deep dive, you can simply pull it up by the tether so you don’t lose your investment.</li></ul><p><strong>Where’s the location of battery, and how long will it last? </strong></p><ul><li>Unlike other drones which need external power or battery, Gladius comes with onboard LIPO smart batteries on the either side, providing a run time of over 3 hours.</li></ul><p><strong>The maximum tether length is 100 meters, so how could Gladius achieve 500 meters operation range? </strong></p><ul><li>Unlike the traditional ROV, the horizontal range can be independent of the tether length. Gladius uses a neutrally buoyant tether to communicate to a towable buoy on the surface and the buoy connects to the pilot using a long range WiFi communication. The floating buoy has an integrate a wireless module with up to 500 meters wireless range (only in Advanced Edition). Even if you use the 30 meter tether, you still have a 500 meters horizontal operating range.</li></ul><p><strong>How to charge the Gladius? </strong></p><ul><li>It’s very easy. The charging port is on the backend of the drone. Just open it and connect to the charger. One full charge takes around 90 minutes.</li></ul><p><strong>How to use the Gladius? </strong></p><ul><li>We use controller and smartphones to control the Gladius. The controller is used for controlling the movement, and the smartphone (with app) is used for shooting, watching and setting. Both are easy to set up and have a friendly UI.</li></ul><p><strong>How do I know when the Gladius is running out of power? </strong></p><ul><li>You can monitor the live information of batteries on the app. When the battery life reaches 20%, the APP will display a Low Battery warning. You can guide the Gladius back to you or pull the cable if the battery dies. The cable can resist a 50kg pull force so you do not need to worry about breaking anything.</li></ul><p><strong>When will shipping start? </strong></p><ul><li>The first batch will begin shipping in June 2017.</li></ul><p><strong>Where does Gladius ship to? </strong></p><ul><li>The Gladius is available for shipping worldwide!</li></ul><p><strong>How much is shipping? </strong></p><ul><li>Shipping is FREE to US, Canada and China. $60 to EU, UK, Australia, &amp; Japan. $99 to Rest of world</li></ul><p><strong>Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT? </strong></p><ul><li>Prices do not include importation taxes, duties or VAT. The backer is responsible for them. Please check your country's import duties before purchasing.</li></ul><p><strong>Is there a warranty with Gladius? </strong></p><ul><li>We provide a one year limited warranty for manufacturing defects. Free repairs and component replacements will be provided under the warranty period for manufacturing defects. It won’t cover the misuse of the product, human factors, surface damages bumps or scratches.</li></ul><p><strong> Where can I repair my Gladius? </strong></p><ul><li>We will list repair stations on our website for your convenience. </li></ul><p><strong>If I have other questions, who should I contact? </strong></p><ul><li>Please reach out to service@chasing-innovation.com</li></ul><p><strong>If I'm interested in a distribution partnership who should I contact? </strong></p><ul><li>Please direct distribution questions to sales@chasing-innovation.com.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><h1 style=""color:#000000;font-family: 'Antenna Cond', sans-serif;font-weight:700;line-height: 5rem;""> </h1><h1 style=""color:#000000;font-family: 'Antenna Cond', sans-serif;font-weight:700;line-height: 5rem;"">

left/right
forward/back
rise/fall
roll
 The powerful rear thrusters will have Gladius zooming through the water (forwards or backwards) at speeds of 2 meters or 6.6 feet per second or at 4 knots.  Video Game-like Simple ControlsSimply insert your iOS or Android smartphone into the remote control.With similarities to a gaming system, you move Gladius through the operation of two joysticks. One operates the forward, back, and turning of the drone (think of it like walking), while the other operates the direction in which the camera faces (think of it like moving your head).  Your smartphone rests in the center of the remote controller, so you can view the live stream of your underwater exploration.  Piloting Depth, Range & Time SubmersedThe Gladius underwater drone is capable of diving up to 100 meters (328ft) deep with a horizontal range of 500 meters (1640ft), while staying submerged for 3 hours.The internal cabin of Gladius is sealed and uses aluminum alloy materials with oxidation treatment to ensure the drone is waterproof and corrosion resistant, allowing it to safely dive to 100 meters or 328 feet with ease. Our unique semi-tether connection system increases the practical range of Gladius up to 500m or just over 1,600 feet. As radio waves don't travel well in water, this tether allows the drone to communicate with the towable buoy by direct wiring.The tether connects to a towable, floating buoy which wireless connects to your smartphone remote control via long range Wifi communication. The buoy has an integrated wireless module with a range of up to 30m (98ft) for the Standard model and an impressive 500m (1,640ft) for the Advanced model.Finally, Gladius' Polymer Lithium batteries have a run time of 3.5 hours while only requiring 1.5 hours of recharge time.     CLICK BELOW TO GET GLADIUS IN TIME FOR SUMMER   Get Standard - $599  |  Get Advanced - $799  |  Get Premium - $1,025 Stunning Underwater Photography & Videography Made EasyCapture high quality photo and video directly to internal storage or live stream your dive in real-time.The Gladius underwater smart drone allows you to explore the depths with crystal clear HD imagery, conduct search and rescue operations from afar, and inspect boats, pools, and equipment without a diver handy. Ultra HD, High Resolution HD CameraGladius features an on-board 1080P (Standard) or 4K (Advanced) camera in order to take stunning underwater photo and video.See the underwater world like never before...

Combined with our unique PID software algorithm, this ensures that the drone maintains stability while you're shooting video and photo. This means Gladius will always stay suspended in place so you can precisely inspect an object at any depth.  Semi-Tether Communication SystemThe Gladius use unique semi-tether connection system, which extremely increase the practical range of vehicle up to 500 meters.The data and image connection system contains two parts: tether and buoy. The tether connects to a towable, floating buoy which wirelessly connects to your smartphone remote control via long range Wifi communication.Gladius uses a neutrally buoyant tether to communicate to a towable buoy on the surface, as radio waves don't travel well in water and particularly at the depths this submarine can dive to. The buoy has an integrated wireless module with a range of up to 30m (98ft) for the Standard model and an impressive 500m (1,640ft) for the Advanced model.All data and image from Gladius are live bidirectional transmissions, so you can watch live 720P HD video feedback (saves at up to 4k on SD card) or control Gladius using a tabled or laptop from a boat or from the shore. In addition to extending range, we see the tether as a huge benefit...if anything happens to your drone at a deep depth, you can simply pull it up by the tether so you don’t lose your underwater drone investment.  Durable Travel Carrying Case Gladius was designed for portability and can easily fit into most backpacks but travels best in its hard-shell case.The Gladius Underwater Drone Professional package comes with a hard-shell carrying case that protects your drone, tether, buoy and controller while in transit.    CLICK BELOW TO GET GLADIUS IN TIME FOR SUMMER   Get Standard - $599  |  Get Advanced - $799  |  Get Premium - $1,025 Gladius Drone Models, Tech Specs, Meet The Team & Production Timeline           Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is Gladius? The Gladius is a smart underwater drone built for filming, observing, and exploring. It is a portable and user friendly device that is able to dive up to 100 meters depth and take high quality 16 Mega pixels photos & 4K videos in full HD.Who created Gladius? Chasing-Innovation Technology Co. LtdWhy should I use Gladius? At an affordable price, the Gladius allows you to enjoy the filming and exploring in 100 meters depth underwater. Whether you are diving, fishing, island hopping or exploring, the GLADIUS is an excellent tool for you.What are the differences between Gladius Standard and Advanced? There’re several different features as follows: Camera: 4K for Advanced, 1080P for Standard; Horizontal Operation Range: 500 meters for Advanced, 30 meters for Standard; SD card capacity: 32G for Advanced, 8G for Standard.How deep can the Gladius dive? For both the Standard and Advanced models, Gladius can dive up to 100 meters / 328 feet.Why does Gladius use wired connection? Radio waves don't travel well through water (especially at deeper depths). Thus, the semi-tether system that we have created. The drone is connected by a tether to the a Wifi enabled buoy. You connect to the buoy via the smartphone remote controller. We have optimized the tether’s weight and diameter to make it easy to carry and use, but not impeding on user experience. Moreover, we see the tether as a huge benefit. If anything happens to your drone during a deep dive, you can simply pull it up by the tether so you don’t lose your investment.Where’s the location of battery, and how long will it last? Unlike other drones which need external power or battery, Gladius comes with onboard LIPO smart batteries on the either side, providing a run time of over 3 hours.The maximum tether length is 100 meters, so how could Gladius achieve 500 meters operation range? Unlike the traditional ROV, the horizontal range can be independent of the tether length. Gladius uses a neutrally buoyant tether to communicate to a towable buoy on the surface and the buoy connects to the pilot using a long range WiFi communication. The floating buoy has an integrate a wireless module with up to 500 meters wireless range (only in Advanced Edition). Even if you use the 30 meter tether, you still have a 500 meters horizontal operating range.How to charge the Gladius? It’s very easy. The charging port is on the backend of the drone. Just open it and connect to the charger. One full charge takes around 90 minutes.How to use the Gladius? We use controller and smartphones to control the Gladius. The controller is used for controlling the movement, and the smartphone (with app) is used for shooting, watching and setting. Both are easy to set up and have a friendly UI.How do I know when the Gladius is running out of power? You can monitor the live information of batteries on the app. When the battery life reaches 20%, the APP will display a Low Battery warning. You can guide the Gladius back to you or pull the cable if the battery dies. The cable can resist a 50kg pull force so you do not need to worry about breaking anything.When will shipping start? The first batch will begin shipping in June 2017.Where does Gladius ship to? The Gladius is available for shipping worldwide!How much is shipping? Shipping is FREE to US, Canada and China. $60 to EU, UK, Australia, & Japan. $99 to Rest of worldWho is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT? Prices do not include importation taxes, duties or VAT.
