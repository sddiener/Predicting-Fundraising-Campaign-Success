<h3> </h3>
<p>Seventh century Scotland. Henry Gunn leads his clan in a ferocious battle with Viking invaders led by the Savage Rathgar! Rathgar sees victory finally within his grasp. Gunn and his men, sensing that this may be their last stand, are saved by the approach of three unknown ships. The Vikings flee, not sure if the new uninvited ""guests"" are friend or foe.</p>
<p>Gunn and his men are saved by the fortuitous approach of Princess Sa' Ra of Alexandria. Sa' Ra has been sent on a mission to find a champion. One that she believes will aid her in her time of need. But the ""Gods"" have an even greater need for this man, Henry Gunn! And if he chooses to ally himself with Sa' Ra and these ""Gods"", he will be forever changed!</p>
<p>Will Gunn undergo the transformation to something other than human, and at what cost? The fate of civilization rests on the shoulders of a troubled warrior, husband, and father. What are you willing to sacrifice for all of humanity?</p>
<p>In the tradition of The Stars My Destination and The Silver Surfer, OFFWORLDER is a star-spanning science fiction saga that will keep you riveted from the first page to the very last.</p>

<p><strong>Blanco Volume One: The Truth Shall Set You Free</strong></p>
<p>In a post-apocalyptic future where man has long since been gone, and medieval kingdoms control their people with an iron fist, religious rule is the order of the day. And Blanco is one of the most beloved warriors in the kingdom of the seraph Azrael.  </p>
<p>He and his brother Cane hunt the heretics who dare defy their father's law. Zealots of a new apocryphal belief that is spreading across the Five Kingdoms and the Middling Lands.</p>
<p>When Blanco discovers a band of heretics is heading through the Outer Zone to a safe haven, they call New Eden. He decides to make an example of them, but what he finds in the Outer Zone will literally change his perception of the world he lives in.</p>

<p><strong>Power to the Pulp</strong></p>
<p>What we wanna bring to all of you is a killer, fun, and wild over-the-top graphic novel with good old melodrama. That combines the brutal sword and sorcery of Conan with great anthropomorphic characters. Reminiscent of Don Bluth's Secret of Nimh or Brian Jacques Redwall series of novels but in a post-apocalyptic adult world.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will be the first of a series of original graphic novels set in the world of Blanco. A bit of pulp goodness you can read over and over. Just long enough to give you a fulfilling story but short enough so that you can enjoy them in between whatever life is throwing at you.</p>
<p>We're in a new golden age of comics right now with a wide assortment of genres hitting the shelves, but there are too many titles for stores, and they can't order them all. And even with the number of publishers out there, they can't publish them all.</p>
<p> <strong>SO THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!</strong> Because we're also in another golden age of self-publishing. Thanks to IndieGoGo and Kickstarter, so many creators have been able to take their careers into their own hands and put out their passion project. Or a project they know has a fanbase out there waiting for them. Even when publishers have told them they don't exist. And that's you. You're that fanbase waiting for the world of Blanco, and only with your help can we make it happen.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>The $3,900 we're asking for will all go toward bringing you the most beautiful and kick-ass graphic novel you will ever read. Jump to those preview pages below if you can't wait to see some of the thunder David's bringing to this project. Besides printing and distribution costs, the money will also go toward a page rate for the fantastic lettering by DC Hopkins and Kickstarter fees. </p>
<p>What are some of those other perks? Well, we have two SPECTACULAR trading cards (check the images below). Besides that, we're offering a mini print (another gorgeous image by David Brame), an early bird special, and a 50% OFF perk for Retailers (in the United States) that includes FREE shipping.

<p>Look at all that energy, joy, and passion in those pages. This is definitely a comic book you want to give a chance. Every volume is going to be worth your hard-earned money.

<p><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></p>
<p>What's a campaign without some stretch goals? Having a sweet and kick-ass graphic novel is one thing, but what about some additional goods to go along with it? But here's the thing. A lot of these campaigns want to throw at you free stuff (via stretch goals) that, even though they're cool, are just extras you might not care for down the line.</p>
<p>That's why we added the trading cards and our mini print to the tiers. Because that's where we want to be different. We want you to get us to stretch goals you will care about, and we aren't asking for some exorbitant price to help us get there. </p>
<p><strong>8-page Back-Up Story</strong>: At the end of the day, while we all love prints and trading cards, there's nothing better than more comics. And that's what we want to offer here. An 8-page backup story from Blanco's past. We'll travel back to when Blanco was a teen and the time he got in over his head. And ended up alone facing off against the terrors of the old world in a city long abandoned in a zone no one dares enter. Titled: <strong>BLANCO in DAMNATION ALLEY​</strong></p>
<p>Stretch Goal #1 - $5,900</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618347924/l9v27rl7tzrydfzsxlwa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>MORE STRETCH GOALS?</strong> Well, let's get to our first stretch goal, and then we'll talk more stretch goals. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We know not everybody can pledge. Especially during these trying times, we're in, but if you like what you see and still wanna help us, then share this page. Share it far and wide across social media. Maybe hit up your friends that can pledge. Comic book fandom isn't always about spending money. It's also about spreading the joy of something you love and something you think is cool. Hopefully, we'll be both for you.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to have this book in your hands by September 2021. Throughout my comic book career, I've always had my back against the wall with the clock ticking when it came to the projects I worked on. I thrive on tight schedules. And if I could get those projects done with the little time we had. Then David and I can definitely get this project finished, printed, and in your hands by our estimated delivery date. But if any issues do arise, we will let you know and keep you constantly updated. Because our number one goal is getting this book out and showing you that we're creators you can trust and that Blanco is a comic book you want to keep on reading.</p>

Stretch Goals
What's a campaign without some stretch goals? Having a sweet and kick-ass graphic novel is one thing, but what about some additional goods to go along with it? But here's the thing. A lot of these campaigns want to throw at you free stuff (via stretch goals) that, even though they're cool, are just extras you might not care for down the line.
That's why we added the trading cards and our mini print to the tiers. Because that's where we want to be different. We want you to get us to stretch goals you will care about, and we aren't asking for some exorbitant price to help us get there. 
8-page Back-Up Story: At the end of the day, while we all love prints and trading cards, there's nothing better than more comics. And that's what we want to offer here. An 8-page backup story from Blanco's past. We'll travel back to when Blanco was a teen and the time he got in over his head. And ended up alone facing off against the terrors of the old world in a city long abandoned in a zone no one dares enter. Titled: BLANCO in DAMNATION ALLEY​
Stretch Goal #1 - $5,900

MORE STRETCH GOALS? Well, let's get to our first stretch goal, and then we'll talk more stretch goals. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
We know not everybody can pledge. Especially during these trying times, we're in, but if you like what you see and still wanna help us, then share this page. Share it far and wide across social media. Maybe hit up your friends that can pledge. Comic book fandom isn't always about spending money. It's also about spreading the joy of something you love and something you think is cool. Hopefully, we'll be both for you.
Risks and challenges
Our goal is to have this book in your hands by September 2021. Throughout my comic book career, I've always had my back against the wall with the clock ticking when it came to the projects I worked on. I thrive on tight schedules. And if I could get those projects done with the little time we had. Then David and I can definitely get this project finished, printed, and in your hands by our estimated delivery date. But if any issues do arise, we will let you know and keep you constantly updated. Because our number one goal is getting this book out and showing you that we're creators you can trust and that Blanco is a comic book you want to keep on reading.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

A woman named Kay claims to have the answers, and promises a way to fix Knox's life - but at what cost?  Randall Rozzell I'm a web designer, living in Raleigh, North Carolina. I'm married with 3 kids and quite a few pets. I've been writing for years, but Whitaker Knox is my first printed book that I've built on my own. I've been working on this for over 10 years in one form or another, and I'm extremely happy to be offering my book to you. Book 1 full-filled a childhood dream. Book 2 is gonna be a rollercoaster ride! Silvio DBSilvio is a fantastic artist, with a solid background in comics. He produces each page digitally, and I'm in awe of his talent. Silvio lives in Recife, Brazil and has been in the comic industry for quite some time, having worked with Bluewater Prod, Image Comics, Gov't Comics, Immortal Comics and several more.List of previously published work: Legend Of Isis#7, #8 and #9 (Bluewater Production); Clockwork#1 (Gov't Comics); Out of our Mind (Comics experience); Meridien City (Alpha Girl Comics) ; Quest (Bad Cat); Time of reflection (self published-eagle award winner); The VIP room (Alpha Girl Comics) ; destiny (snap Comics), Mascate (Draconian - Brazil), Outlaw Territory V.3 (Image Comics); The Locksmith ( Self Published - USA); Cleansing the World - Flood Myths Around the World (Capstone Books); Gretel - Crônicas dos sobreviventes (Immortal comics ) -Cyberpunks (Immortal comics) - Ctchulhu is Hard to spell (Independant - USA) - Crossroads (Immortal Comics); Ninja -Japan's Stealthy Secret Agents (Capstone Books); Vikings Scandinavian's Ferocious Sea Riders (Capstone Books).",36.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Ties to WW2</h2>
<p>I'm a big history buff and always love to ground my tales in real-life horror. The twisted experiments that the Japanese scientists conducted during the war were some of the most disturbing accounts I had read in a long time. What's even more horrifying is that the worst of those scientists were given immunity after the war. WIREHEAD's creator is Dr. Yuji Akastu. In exchange for his immunity, Dr. Akatsu must continue his research in developing an army of metal men!</p>

<h3>Who is Octobriana?</h3>
<p>The character originally appeared in <i>Octobriana and the Russian Underground</i> by Petr Sadecky, a 1971 book that claimed that a group of dissident youth were fighting back against an oppressive Soviet regime by creating an ongoing series of surreal underground comic strips starring their globe-trotting heroine Octobriana. </p>
<p>The truth that this group never existed and that the strips were doctored works of Czech artists (Bohumil Konečný and Zdeněk Burian) only added to the character's mystique, inspiring other comic creators like Bryan Talbot and Jim Rugg... and even music luminaries like David Bowie, Billy Idol and Amanda Lear.</p>
<p>The assembled creative talent in the anthology provides an eclectic showcase of the Russian Devil-Woman and established fans and new audiences alike.</p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Kevin Marcus joins his old buddy for drinks, and witnesses the unbelievable. In the middle of their visit his friend panics, and races to the restroom. Kevin follows only to walk in on the Reaper having cornered his friend. Kevin attempts to intercede to no avail, and witnesses the Reaper take his friends life. Before leaving the Reaper calls to Kevin by name, and says the next time they see each other, he'll only have 15 minutes left to live. FIFTEEN MINUTES follows Kevin Marcus as he navigates this reality, and how he chooses to prepare for the return of the Reaper.</p>

<p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>I'm Anthony Hary, writer and illustrator for FIFTEEN MINUTES. Originally we published FIFTEEN MINUTES through a Kickstarter campaign. It was a huge privilege to have a successful campaign. It also resulted in a limited number of people getting their own copy of the graphic novel.</p>
<p>With this campaign we're releasing a SPECIAL EDITION version of FIFTEEN MINUTES. The graphic novel still contains the original story, and has increased from a 60 page book, to a 92 page book with the addition of a sketchbook to the end of the book collecting some of my best illustrations over the recent years.</p>

<h3>The Lowdown:</h3>
<p>This campaign is very straightforward. THE BOOK IS DONE and already headed to the printer. We simply want to know how many copies to print. This is where you come in. Order your copy of FIFTEEN MINUTES: SPECIAL EDITION today, and receive it when the books print in August 2021.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>BONUS: When we pass our $500 goal, and reach $750, I will include a surprise ORIGINAL SKETCH with each book. </p>

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>I'm Doug Garrett,  I have always wanted to make my own comic book and I decided that time is now! Jeff Lasley is the artist that I am working with. Jeff and I both have Native American ancestry and a love of the supernatural. We want to bring to you the story of Lone Wolf. You can follow us on twitter @dg310 and @jefflasley.</p>
<h3>What is Lone Wolf about?</h3>
<p>Lone Wolf is about a 200 year old Cherokee warrior and his fight against supernatural evil. He is the last in a long line of protectors, who have always protected the Earth. Wolf was chosen by his grandfather to carry on the fight, but the world was changing around them. He is given a gift that he doesn't understand and struggles to control. He does the best with what he has and is determined to honor his family. With his grandfather's guidance, he continues to push back against evil. His past is far from dead and continues to shape his future. </p>

Wolf was chosen by his grandfather to carry on the fight, but the world was changing around them. He is given a gift that he doesn't understand and struggles to control. He does the best with what he has and is determined to honor his family. With his grandfather's guidance, he continues to push back against evil. His past is far from dead and continues to shape his future. 
The Artwork
The book is going to be offered as black and white newsprint or a full color modern style book.
UPDATED 1/10/19
We just hired a colorist. The book is now going to have some awesome colors, here's a sample.
 
UPDATED 2/3/19 
The colored Pages are coming in. We have posted them for your viewing pleasure!









 

This is what we need.

We need $3000 dollars to make this book happen. That money will be used to pay the artist, the letterer, printing and shipping. We don't make any profit at that point, this is just getting the book done.
Make Comics Great Again!
We want to make a fun book, without any political commentary or ideology! We like our comics to be escapism from the pressures of everyday life!
Please share with your friends
We are just a couple of Tennessee boys trying to chase a dream. Chase that dream with us! Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your friend's family! Comics books are cool!
Stretch Goals
$4000 - hire a colorist 
 
We are adding Jeff's Art Book as a Perk!
If you like creepy creatures this is right up your alley!

<h3>Why Back The Bubbas?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As some of you may know, the Bubbas are my real life family members. They have been with me through some of my lowest moments and my greatest achievements. And this comic book is the legacy I am making for them. During the creation of issue four, Foley lived a lifetime's worth of adventure. From first donning the cape in issue 3, to having his Grandma Marilyn create him his very own Mister Woobie costume, Foley guided his little brother Grayson, on the ins and outs of being a hero. The duo appeared in a 2021 calendar for Arizona entertainment super store, Bookmans in full superhero garb. On March 6, 2021 after more than a year long battle with cancer, Foley's physical being transitioned from this world. He was surrounded by those who loved him. Cradled in my arms, and wearing his Mister Woobie cape, Foley made me promise I would see this project through.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The Bubba Patrol brings the tradition of fun back to comic books. It's akin to the Silver Age of comics where things were a bit more light hearted, boldly colored and printed on newsprint.</li>
<li>Speaking of which, your support means we can bring you issue 4 how it was meant to be experienced, on newsprint. Sure we could do the regular on demand printing, but that's not our end goal. The Bubba Patrol isn't just a comic book, it's the Greatest Comic Book In The World.</li>
<li>The Bubba Patrol is perfect for beginning readers, to first time comic book collectors, to seasoned veterans of the game.</li>
<li>Three full issues and one mini issue have all been funded, and fulfilled utilizing crowd funding since 2017</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Honesty and transparency is extremely important to me, as it should be to you. After all, you're putting your money and trust into these projects. Obviously the side effects of the pandemic have caused issues with publishing for even the biggest of the Big Two in the industry. The printing program we used for the last three issues of the Bubba Patrol is currently on an indefinite hiatus. This has meant finding an alternate printer to meet our needs. And costs are different thus this campaign. But physical challenges are only one obstacle any campaign faces. As an artist who lives in the really real world, I face the challenge of the everyday, and that means hurdles including depression and anxiety along the way. These can slow down the process, but will never stop it. So, like any good hero, we've come up with some contingencies.</p>

I was one of them.</p><p>A few years ago I’ve found out about Independent Comics, from watching Jeff Lafferty’s videos on YouTube.

<h3><u><strong>A Dream Years In The Making</strong></u></h3>
<p>I'm the writer/director of <i>Escape the Night  </i>and the gaming shows<i>Tabletop, Spellslingers, </i>and<i> Sagas of Sundry.</i> I've been dreaming up this story and wanting to bring it to life through comics for years, the place where my love for visual storytelling started and still lives.</p>
<p><strong>THE EIGHTH<i> </i></strong>is the epic story of three teenagers who unlock a piece of ancient Sumerian armor and end up committing murder. Before they know it, they find themselves on a terrifying journey to destroy the world, with no going back.</p>
<p>Math is the language David, our anti-hero, uses to command the living piece of armor to take different shapes, his true superpower. The armor once belonged to The Eighth Sage of the Sumerian world. The other seven were responsible for the flood that cleansed the earth four thousand years ago, an event some would like to see happen again.</p>
<p>David believes the armor can make the world change. However, his two friends share different thoughts. Emma sees the armor as a way to exact revenge, and Atticus wants to destroy it. They leave their hometown in ruins and scramble across the world searching for the missing pieces of the armor and themselves.</p>
<p>The series is hard-hitting, fantastical, and full of twists. All brought to life by the amazing art of JORIN EVERS, my longtime creative collaborator.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Keith Gleason and I’m the creator and writer of the Mighty Mascots. Welcome to my campaign! The series started in 2019 with Alterna Comics and was a great success (it was the tenth best seller in Alterna comics history!) Now, the Mascots and I are back with the next story, and I'm asking the fans for some help!</p>
<p>For those new to the comic, The Mighty Mascots are a super-group formed from a freak 3D printing accident. Together, they fight the evil Al-Chem group that is bent on taking over the world by using an army of corrupted and twisted versions of beloved brand mascots and characters.</p>

<p>The series was inspired by my love of Saturday Morning Cartoons and my passion for silver age comic books! Joining me in my crusade to bring the Mascots to life is the incredible art team of Ian Waryanto (Doorkickers) and Anton Bandi (Jawara)! Both of these artists are seasoned professionals in the field and their work is top notch. They have helped to give the series its signature look! </p>

<h3>Storyline</h3>
<p>The new story arc (Issues 4,5,6) titled ""Byte the Dust"" introduces us to a new villain named Jordan Tecmo. He is charged with finding a powerful energy source for the corrupt Al-Chem Group. Setting up in an old abandoned arcade he brings to life a group of sinister 16-bit video game characters using the tainted 3D Printing formula! The Mighty Mascots are once again called to action, but their leader Captain Horatio HoneyFlakes is distracted and suffering from a troubling dream he keeps having about an old breakfast commercial. Will the mascots be able to save the day and once again stop Doctor Baneful and the Al-Chem group from destroying the city?</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since this is a 100% independently made comic book, all production costs fall on the creator's shoulders.</p>
<p>All of the money raised with this campaign will first go towards paying the artists for their hard work. Any additional funds raised after they are paid will be funneled into creating future issues, reward perks, additional stretch goals, shipping, fees, convention appearances, etc.</p>
<p>This will be my third crowd funding campaign and my first on Indiegogo. In previous campaigns I have delivered on all my rewards, and I am committed to making the perks and stretch goals of this campaign everything a comic book fan could ask for!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word on social media if you can! Any help is greatly appreciated!! I'm also available for interviews on Podcasts, You Tube Streams, etc. Message me through the campaign.</p>

The new story arc (Issues 4,5,6) titled ""Byte the Dust"" introduces us to a new villain named Jordan Tecmo. He is charged with finding a powerful energy source for the corrupt Al-Chem Group. Setting up in an old abandoned arcade he brings to life a group of sinister 16-bit video game characters using the tainted 3D Printing formula! The Mighty Mascots are once again called to action, but their leader Captain Horatio HoneyFlakes is distracted and suffering from a troubling dream he keeps having about an old breakfast commercial. Will the mascots be able to save the day and once again stop Doctor Baneful and the Al-Chem group from destroying the city?



Various Perks Available With This Campaign!




Stretch Goals!












Risks & Challenges
Since this is a 100% independently made comic book, all production costs fall on the creator's shoulders.
All of the money raised with this campaign will first go towards paying the artists for their hard work. Any additional funds raised after they are paid will be funneled into creating future issues, reward perks, additional stretch goals, shipping, fees, convention appearances, etc.
This will be my third crowd funding campaign and my first on Indiegogo. In previous campaigns I have delivered on all my rewards, and I am committed to making the perks and stretch goals of this campaign everything a comic book fan could ask for!
Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word on social media if you can! Any help is greatly appreciated!! I'm also available for interviews on Podcasts, You Tube Streams, etc. Message me through the campaign.",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Lore:</strong> The VeilWalker takes place in a world where a small percentage of the population is born with The Gift, which allows those granted with it to use their mana to cast all kinds of spells. To protect those aforementioned from not only the ignorance of man, but also the evil spawn of the Veil, The Order Of The Veil Guard was established in the late middle ages. For centuries The Order has balanced the study of the Veil and maintained not just its secrecy but that of the Gifted population as a whole. The Veil and why it has weakened at an exponential rate still remains shrouded and in the days to come Alexander will witness the Veil ripped asunder like never before. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Set up:</strong> After the disappearance of an urban explorer is seen on live stream, The head of the Veil Guards Inquisitors branch is tasked with investigating for potential VeilSpawn involvement. However, Alexander soon finds that the greatest challenge he will face tonight was one he thought long subdued. This story will push Alexanders and his skills to their limits, Ultimately placing the fate of the world on his ability to find answers he has spent a lifetime searching for.</p> <p><strong>Why Indiegogo:</strong> The art has already been funded, pencils and inks are done, colors have just started. The reason I'm asking for your support on Indiegogo is to begin the funding process for Issue two, but primarily I would love to give you all the ability to join The VeilGuard as our fight is just beginning. I truly believe The VeilWalker belongs on Indiegogo, I hope you do to. &lt;3</p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We've tried to mitigate any potential lateness with this book by beginning production months ago. We will ideally ship all books by the end of October, but set our delivery deadline to November 2021. We've done this to ensure that we deliver your rewards on time or EARLY. We've learned the hard way; with experience, that delays CAN happen and sometimes there's not a thing we as publishers can do about it. We strive to give our Artist enough time to do their best work and accommodate their needs especially around these trying times. We make sure that regardless of any delay, we give consistent updates throughout the process, often with examples of work-in-progress (WIP) pages. We love what we do, and we always finish what we start with quality and longevity in mind. At Oasi Comics we understand the care, the quality, and the craft that comics deserve. We love comics and overall great story telling, so making them is a dream come true for us. Thanks to all of our backers for helping us tell these stories.</p>
</div></div>","A 25 paged Action-thriller, The VeilWalker #1 introduces us to a world of horrors ruled from the shadows by an ancient institution of magicians called The Order Of The Veil Guard. Readers will follow the exploits of this orders most decorated Inquisitor, Alexander Salvador Infamously known as The VeilWalker.

Risk and Challenges



Lore: The VeilWalker takes place in a world where a small percentage of the population is born with The Gift, which allows those granted with it to use their mana to cast all kinds of spells. To protect those aforementioned from not only the ignorance of man, but also the evil spawn of the Veil, The Order Of The Veil Guard was established in the late middle ages. For centuries The Order has balanced the study of the Veil and maintained not just its secrecy but that of the Gifted population as a whole. The Veil and why it has weakened at an exponential rate still remains shrouded and in the days to come Alexander will witness the Veil ripped asunder like never before. 
 
The Set up: After the disappearance of an urban explorer is seen on live stream, The head of the Veil Guards Inquisitors branch is tasked with investigating for potential VeilSpawn involvement. However, Alexander soon finds that the greatest challenge he will face tonight was one he thought long subdued. This story will push Alexanders and his skills to their limits, Ultimately placing the fate of the world on his ability to find answers he has spent a lifetime searching for. Why Indiegogo: The art has already been funded, pencils and inks are done, colors have just started. The reason I'm asking for your support on Indiegogo is to begin the funding process for Issue two, but primarily I would love to give you all the ability to join The VeilGuard as our fight is just beginning. I truly believe The VeilWalker belongs on Indiegogo, I hope you do to. <3

<h3><i><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></i></h3>
<p>THE ULTIMATE CRUSADERS is a<strong> 36-page sci-fi, action-adventure comic book series based on the mid 90's and early 2000's television shows and comic books.</strong> The story revolves around a young, socially awkward boy genius named Orion Williams and his best friend, Claire Rosemary, who work together to build a massive mechanical suit in the hopes of discovering the whereabouts of Orion's father, who has been lost in space for nearly three years.</p>

<p><strong>""BUT JOE, YOU'RE A NOOB IN COMICS! HOW CAN I TRUST YOU TO DELIVER?""</strong></p>
<p>Woah there friend! This may be my FIRST comic book, but I've been both an art student and freelance artist for years now and have been expected to deliver on deadlines. I take pride in always meeting my deadlines and delivering QUALITY. I've always loved comics and am naturally drawn to them as an art form. I will not let you down! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>WE CAN DO THIS!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>All I'm asking for is $500 to print the first batch! That's it! OF COURSE there will be multiple stretch goals set later. I'm already talking to artists about trading cards, figurines and other things but that's down the line. My goal is to fund this comic and get it into your hands!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHEN WILL I GET IT?</h3>
<p>I have the campaign ""estimated delivery"" set for this time next year, but don't worry! I'm shooting to have this book in your hands before APRIL of 2021, just in time for ""For The Fans Fest""!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm a one man team right now, that means two things.</p>
<p>THE BAD: I bear the entire workload of the comic.</p>
<p>THE GOOD:  I don't need to rely on anyone else for work to be delivered on time. I already have about 6 pages completed.</p>
<p>The challenge is the time it takes to do this. BUT as I've already started the art and am probably drawing as you read this, the book is well on its way to completion.</p>

</div></div>","Overview
From the creators of Englewood, Doc Salem, and Battle Brick Road comes a horror comic like no other. Three Knights, Four Days part one is a 44 page full-color graphic novel set in the year 1188. After returning from the Second Crusade, Three Knights from three different orders of knighthood return to the hometown of their leader to hopefully retire from war. As they arrive at their comrade's home, they find the town besieged by a Satanic cult, and are the only thing that stands between the townspeople and utter annihilation. 
If you're a fan of Berserk, The Thirteenth Warrior, Prince of Darkness, or video games like Baldur's Gate and Doom, this is the comic for you!

 



A Comic Book All-Star Team!
The creative team behind this comic is unmatched when it comes to raw talent. Micah Curtis, creator and writer of Englewood takes the helm of the project. The grim visuals are brought to life by the art of Preston Acevedo of Rockabilly Roadtrip, and Doc Salem, with the gruesome pages colored by Oliver Lee Arce. The thoughts and words of these complex characters are brought to life by the wonderful lettering of Eric Weathers, creator of Flying Fortress.

<h3>How does Indiegogo work?</h3>
<p>I have a funding goal of $500, but really that's just the pre-set minimum amount Indiegogo let's you start at. This new zine will be printed regardless if we reach $500 total pledges. This isn't like Kickstarter in that if we don't reach the goal the campaign doesn't happen.<br/><br/>So if you pledge to any of the perks here you will definitely be getting that one, no worries.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>As to who I am...</h3>
<p>I'm a cartoonist and self-publisher, with 23 years experience in creating and producing numerous comic books and graphic novels. My signature comic book character El Muerto debuted in 1998 and in 2007 was adapted into a live action film starring Wilmer Valderrama. I also work as an educator, teaching comic book workshops at schools and libraries. I also lecture at museums and universities, sharing the story of my creative journey and also on the contributions of Latino creators in the American comic book market.<br/><br/>And of course I'm also a lifelong Steve Ditko fan, having first seen his work through Marvel Tales as well as the Marvel Pocket Books from the late 1970s. This zine is my love letter to the amazing comics and inspiring career of the man from Johnstown, PA, and I hope you can join in with support by pre-ordering the new book.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is my first Indiegogo campaign but I did run my first Kickstarter campaign in 2020 for some new El Muerto comics, which raised over $5,000.</li>
<li>I chose Indiegogo this time around because it has a much faster approval process and I wanted to get this book printed and in your hands as soon as possible, plus it's set to debut on September 11 at the Ditko Con during the last day of the  Bottle Works Steve Ditko exhibit.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Any pitfalls?</h3>
<p>The one thing hovering over all of us is the unpredictability of Covid-19. Mail service or my printing partners could be affected, but as of right now everything seems to be running as usual. The zine is just about done, with only a few more days work on it. Those of you who follow me on social networks know I'm constantly active on there so I'll keep everyone updated there as well as through the Indiegogo channel. Remember this is a quick two week campaign so things will move fairly quickly!<br/> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We at Club Stripes/Hot Cider Press have been producing books and digital content for the furry/anthro community for more than ten years. While we try to accommodate as much of our production risks as possible, we acknowledge there is always a slight risk of problems in production, and keep backup companies in mind for production assistance in the unlikely event of a problem in manufacturing. The biggest risk is that the books cannot arrive in time for the convention, but our current printer is highly reliable and as long as our files are turned in by the time specified, they have been reliably early, rather than late. :)<br/>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

While we try to accommodate as much of our production risks as possible, we acknowledge there is always a slight risk of problems in production, and keep backup companies in mind for production assistance in the unlikely event of a problem in manufacturing. The biggest risk is that the books cannot arrive in time for the convention, but our current printer is highly reliable and as long as our files are turned in by the time specified, they have been reliably early, rather than late. :)

Sogna di diventare un maestro musicista, ed ogni anno attende con impazienza di poter ritrovare la madre, con la quale passa i mesi invernali in un ambiente impregnato di musica.Oyukiお雪 – NeveMisteriosa e bellissima, la madre di Kyōka veste abiti preziosi e vive in ritiro tra le montagne. La sua straordinaria abilità nel canto, e lo splendido suono del suo koto, un raffinato strumento a corde, sembrano rievocare gli antichi fasti delle corti del passato. COME USEREMO I FONDIIl primo volumetto di Yukidama includerà primi due capitoli sceneggiati da Masakoi e interamente disegnati e colorati da KumiShire.

Prince Gunnar Rovewulf defends the Moonshire with the help of the Blood Hammer, the most powerful weapon in the universe that just so happens to be powered by the blood of it's enemies. When his father is kidnapped by the evil Tollman, Prince Gunnar sets out to find him, but along the way unearths the truth behind the Blood Hammer and his father's dealings with the Tollman. His quest takes him to Earth, where he is bonded with an unsuspecting and unwilling human, Travis.

<h3>Behind DOWNCAST</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Clint Stoker. I have been writing fiction for years. Most notable was my novel ALL FOR OWEN. While I love writing novels, comics are my passion. I set aside writing novels to write comics. I honed my skills, and developed the craft of writing comics until it was time to team up with the right people to publish a professional-level comic.</p>
<p>DOWNCAST was a project that I had wanted to publish for years. I wrote a few versions of the script but it never quite felt ready. Until now. With the right script under my belt and with the help of a professional creative team, DOWNCAST is here, and better than I had ever imagined it could be</p>

</ul><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><ul>
<li>As with ""Origin"" and ""Odyssey"" in the past, Jim Lawson has very graciously attached himself to the project as our artist, however he does need compensation. 6 pages of “THE SHREDDER” have already been commissioned and completed in order to show you what is in store, but to complete the project additional funding is needed. Beyond this and the printing costs (which we know very well what to expect after ""Origin,"" ""Odyssey,"" and the Image conclusion) and the actual campaign fees to Indiegogo, we need to make sure every base is covered.</li>
<li>We are definitely not asking for money to profit in any way, shape, or form – we are only looking for funds to continue commissioning Jim Lawson for the pages that remain, then see things through on the production side. In addition to helping bring to fruition this project contributing is also a big way to give back to a man who has given a great deal to TMNT as we know it today. </li>
<li>Funds received will be going to Jim Lawson first and foremost to get the remaining pages pencilled and inked, then to our colorist, and then to cover the final cost of the printing and distribution which we need to not lose sight of. Rich Horn, who was a huge asset during ""Origin"" and ""Odyssey""'s distribution, has also graciously agreed to help in all matters of that to ensure speedy delivery of the final product.</li>
<li>The greatest care will be taken in the final shipping of the printed books. Rich Horn at tmnt-ninjaturtles.com has been been doing this a long time and sends books out with high quality packaging.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Risk</strong></p><ul><li>In the event this campaign is unsuccessful to meet its goal, if at least 50% of goal is met then it will still be full-steam ahead. This is a passion project and it will be seen through, the same as ""Origin,"" ""Odyssey"" and the Image TMNT finisher. Jim Lawson will continue to be commissioned, albeit at a slower pace. If less than 50% of the goal is reached, however, all funds will be returned. </li></ul><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><ul>
<li>Can’t contribute? You can help by getting the word out about our campaign, spreading the word about “THE SHREDDER” and this Indiegogo page to other Turtle fans.</li>

Frank Fosco has done the back cover! Colored by Courtland Brugger.

Backup material from other talent to be announced!
An additional backup with Shadow will be included as well, featuring art by Arseniy Dubakov.
We have a variety of rewards in store for people able and willing to contribute to the project, as you will see below.
What We Need & What You Get
As with ""Origin"" and ""Odyssey"" in the past, Jim Lawson has very graciously attached himself to the project as our artist, however he does need compensation. 6 pages of “THE SHREDDER” have already been commissioned and completed in order to show you what is in store, but to complete the project additional funding is needed. Beyond this and the printing costs (which we know very well what to expect after ""Origin,"" ""Odyssey,"" and the Image conclusion) and the actual campaign fees to Indiegogo, we need to make sure every base is covered.
We are definitely not asking for money to profit in any way, shape, or form – we are only looking for funds to continue commissioning Jim Lawson for the pages that remain, then see things through on the production side. In addition to helping bring to fruition this project contributing is also a big way to give back to a man who has given a great deal to TMNT as we know it today. 
Funds received will be going to Jim Lawson first and foremost to get the remaining pages pencilled and inked, then to our colorist, and then to cover the final cost of the printing and distribution which we need to not lose sight of. Rich Horn, who was a huge asset during ""Origin"" and ""Odyssey""'s distribution, has also graciously agreed to help in all matters of that to ensure speedy delivery of the final product.
The greatest care will be taken in the final shipping of the printed books. Rich Horn at tmnt-ninjaturtles.com has been been doing this a long time and sends books out with high quality packaging.
The RiskIn the event this campaign is unsuccessful to meet its goal, if at least 50% of goal is met then it will still be full-steam ahead. This is a passion project and it will be seen through, the same as ""Origin,"" ""Odyssey"" and the Image TMNT finisher. Jim Lawson will continue to be commissioned, albeit at a slower pace. If less than 50% of the goal is reached, however, all funds will be returned. Other Ways You Can Help
Can’t contribute? You can help by getting the word out about our campaign, spreading the word about “THE SHREDDER” and this Indiegogo page to other Turtle fans.

She usually tends to spend time with Reiko who she makes her cosplay and use her as a doll due to her height.</p>

Why Back Mizuki Saga
 

The funds from the campaign will go directly towards the printing and rewards first, then production second.
The core artwork production has already been funded internally so the book pages are already in production and we're going for a flex funding this round. 
The funds will help us get the book and the series off the ground and allow us to eventually expand. 
We’ll be continuing to update free pages to the public every two weeks via our main website and other respective sites.
We are doing this to prove that we can release a quality product and release it in a timely manner.
Our goal is to release the physical releases quarterly or every two months, depending on how much support we get.
We’ll need your support to help get this series off the ground.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As a fan of many Fantasy and Science Fiction works, <i>Necromancer</i> is world that scratches all those itches I enjoy in my entertainment: Tense thriller, enticing mystery, heart-pumping action, epic, heroic fantasy, and meticulously thought out societies and dogmas that flesh out this world. In this world the (Orthodox) Necromancer follows three simple precepts: Do not consort with the Dark Gods, the Undead are profane, and do as you wish, but pay the price.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this 24 page story a Necromancer by the name of Gregor Mortem will navigate this treacherous world of dark magic and advanced technology as he goes up against rabid goblins and the profane undead. Gregor will question himself and his upbringing as he faces these daunting and dangerous trials while navigating sleazy mob bases, virtual-reality simulations, and desecrated graves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course the perfect artist to illustrate this lurid tale as you will see below in the preview pages is senior Ibai Canales. His Basque's use of expressive faces, over the top violence, and love of Gothic architecture paint a beautiful picture on the world of Necromancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This comic will be the very first of many to come in the world of Necromancer, and if this campaign is successful then in the future you will be able to see the setting go from gritty cyberpunk noir to a High Fantasy, WW2-esque war epic as Gregor Mortem moves beyond the walls of District 13.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding goal is just enough to cover the printing and shipping costs of the book to backers.  I did meticulous research and arithmetic to make sure the goal would not be set too low to not be able to cover all expenses and taxes. The art has already been paid for and done as was intended so that I could make the price of the book as low as possible up front. Hopefully you will all be kind enough to get us above and beyond so that we may be able to hire a professional colorist, letterer, and maybe even make a  backup story to go along with the book.</p>
<p>The perks of this campaign are designed to give options to the backers whether you prefer reading digital (or live abroad), like holding a physical book in your hand, and for those who want to collect those special first edition copies.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>With the funding of this campaign I will not only be able to put the wild and crazy thoughts in my head into print, but you will be helping to build a Necromancer universe that will go on to tell many inspiring stories to come and maybe even branch out into other mediums. In the meantime without corporate backing or the infrastructure of an established comic company we need your help in order to print this baby and deliver it write to you (or email it if that's your thing).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though Ibai Canales has been behind other crowdfunding campaigns (including the six-figure hit Ironsights with Richard Meyer) this will be my first campaign myself so I will take full responsibility in bringing you a high-quality book in a professional and timely manner.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we unfortunately do not get funding we need then the book will not see print and you will be refunded for your contribution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the book does get funded and beyond then there may be mistakes made along the way as this is my first campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Know that If we at least reach the base funding goal then you will be Guaranteed to receive the book no matter what it costs me.</p>

<p>Of course if you don't have the money at the moment you can help by sharing this project across the social media landscape whether its twitter, facebook, gab, minds, the chans, or you can even spam your friends discord channels.</p>

<p><strong>Lila</strong>— formerly one of the evil Astrals (and an alien/human hybrid)— struggles between her loyalties to her former masters and her ""human friends"" who have encouraged her to cultivate her own ""free will"".  Nevertheless, Lila's ""darker side"" can be unrelenting and unforgiving— though she is usually calm, cool and coldly logical unless provoked!</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>, a sneaky Russian hacker and wanted fugitive, can open any lock, crack any code, and solve any puzzle!  He is usually out for his own personal gain— unless his current goals just ""happen"" to align with DeVane, etc.  ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend?"" Rob would no doubt agree— but are his amazing abilities the result of his exposure to Astral energy as a small child?</p>
<p><strong>DeVane </strong>is, well, DeVane— a ""man's man"" relic from the bygone era of bravado— take it or leave it!  An ex-NASA space-shuttle commander, DeVane spiraled into drunken obscurity— and out of his mind— after a space accident years ago that killed hundreds of people.  Now, he's back— and fixated on spoiling the plans of the evil Astrals and acting as a ""de facto"" mentor to Lila.  He's Dirty Harry, Rooster Cogburn, John McClane, and Snake Plissken all rolled into one!  How's that for a role model?  Cryptocurrency? Cisgender?  ...the Internet?  DeVane has no clue what you're talking about!</p>
<p><strong>Jeannie </strong>is a NASA-shuttle-pilot-turned-academic-overachiever, and a single mom to Angelica.  Her intense drive to succeed in technology, aerospace, and medical sciences often results in strained relationships with her friends (ex-fiancée, DeVane) and her relatives (Angelica)— although her kind, caring, and generous nature makes up for it!  Often the ""voice of reason"", Jeannie is the ""glue"" binding them all together!</p>
<p><strong>Angelica</strong>, a classic ""bad girl"", comes with a matching bad attitude to boot!  Born without the ability to hear or speak, she's not going to let those small deficiencies stop her from being a rebellious, badass, hell-raising teen-- much to the chagrin of her ""proper"" and ""squeaky-clean"" law-abiding mother, Jeannie!</p>

<h3><strong>Wait... these are the GOOD GUYS?</strong></h3>
<p>Yep, and that’s the appeal of ""<strong>Astral</strong>"" graphic novels— the quirkiness of these characters and their interactions is a gold mine for <i><strong>humor</strong></i>, something often found lacking in much of today's science fiction and action fare...</p>
<p>More importantly, however, no matter how dire any alien threat faced by Earth, our little band of misfit heroes (or anti-heroes?) must first confront a much greater challenge:</p>
<p><i>Can they resolve to set aside their differences, and learn to work together as a team?</i></p>
<h3><strong>...and, speaking of teams:</strong></h3>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong>You're in good hands!</strong></h3>
<p>We're the <strong>Astral Team:</strong> A troupe of international artists and creators with hundreds of years of comics-industry experience between us!  We produce <strong>ASTRAL </strong>under the <strong>Pet Piranha Entertainment </strong>and <strong>Visionary Creative Services </strong>banners!</p>

<h3><strong>Jay, why are you doing this?</strong></h3>
<p>I'm <i><strong>passionate </strong></i>about ""<strong>Astral</strong>"", and over the years I've grown to absolutely <i><strong>love </strong></i>it-- as many others do-- and I'm sure <strong>YOU</strong> will, <i><strong>too!</strong></i></p>
<p>The fact is, I'm a <i><strong>fully-independent</strong></i> creator of comics— <i><strong>without </strong></i>the <strong>multibillion dollar </strong>promotion, advertising, and distribution networks of those other ""big"" comic publishers.</p>
<p>By <strong>pledging for our books</strong>, you're not only <strong><i>supporting me and my team</i></strong>— you're making a <strong>direct contribution </strong>to the <i><strong>survival </strong></i>of <strong>small independent publishers like us</strong>— <i><strong>proving </strong></i>that <strong>quality storytelling and artwork</strong> can <i><strong>prevail </strong></i>in a <strong>hypercommercial </strong>world of <strong>mass-production</strong> dominated by <i><strong>rich and </strong></i><i><strong>powerful corporations!</strong></i></p>
<p>The way we're <i><strong>different </strong></i>is that, through the ""<strong>Astral</strong>"" graphic novels and their <strong>character-driven stories</strong>, we explore <i><strong>core themes </strong></i>about <strong>humanity </strong>and <i><strong>challenge </strong></i>the ""<strong>human condition</strong>""— by way of a <strong>gripping</strong> and <strong>action-packed</strong> thrill ride!  Also, <i><strong>explosions!</strong></i></p>
<p><strong>The cool part is:</strong> Unlike a lot of <i><strong>heavy-handed </strong></i>sci-fi books out there, the <strong>Astral </strong>adventures splash-in a little humor here-and-there, so it’s <strong>upbeat</strong>, <strong>engaging</strong>, and— <strong>most importantly</strong>-- <i><strong>FUN!</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Having completed several crowdfunding campaigns already, I have a deep appreciation for what it means to launch a campaign and ask for your support!</p>
<p>I also have a keen understanding of how crowdfunding platforms work, having already completed fulfillment for our past campaigns, ""Astral Genesis"" and ""Astral Evolution"". As such, I'm confident that my team and I will be able deliver your rewards as promised, upon successful completion of the campaign.</p>
<p>In addition, my team and I have over 30 years' experience in comics and collectibles fulfillment— so please rest assured that we’ll have no problem shipping your books and other rewards to you promptly as soon as we receive them from our printer.</p>
<p>With overseas production there is always a possibility that delays can occur in the phases of printing, shipping, and customs inspections. As with our previous campaigns, I will be monitoring the process closely, and you have my assurance that if there is any schedule slippage, I will communicate it to you (along with our plan for addressing it) as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, unforeseen circumstances and resulting delays may occur due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. If such conditions arise, I will communicate the situation— and our contingency plan— to you at my earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p>Notice to backers residing outside of the United States who pledge for physical (mailed) rewards: We cannot be responsible for import/duty fees your home country may charge.  Thus far, we have not had any reports of import/duty fees from backers of previous ""Astral"" campaigns— but since other countries' import laws have the potential to change at any time (and without any notice to us), we cannot absolutely guarantee that it will not occur.</p>
<p>REFUND POLICY: Backers eligible for a refund under Indiegogo's Refund Policy may request one via that method. If a refund is not possible through Indiegogo's Refund Policy (or the backer is deemed ineligible) then refunds for this campaign are governed by the Pet Piranha Refund Policy, below. Note that purchases made via InDemand are governed by Indiegogo's Refund Policy for InDemand projects, and no refunds will be provided once the time period allotted for refunds under InDemand has elapsed.</p>
<p>PET PIRANHA REFUND POLICY: Backers may request refunds from Pet Piranha through the 15TH DAY after the campaign's final ""active date"" (or ""end date"") for raising funds. The amount refunded will be less any INDIEGOGO, payment-processing, and administrative fees— and all perks associated with the refunded pledge will be considered forfeited. After the 15th day post-campaign, no refunds will be provided by Pet Piranha, since all monies raised through the campaign will, at that time, be fully committed toward the fulfillment of the project.</p>
<p><strong>PLEDGE WITH CONFIDENCE!</strong></p>
<p>As always, all of your ""Astral"" rewards are fully backed by the ""Pet Piranha Entertainment Guarantee"" (see below). Please contact me if there is anything amiss with your rewards package, and my team and I will do whatever is within our power to make it right!</p>

Lila— formerly one of the evil Astrals (and an alien/human hybrid)— struggles between her loyalties to her former masters and her ""human friends"" who have encouraged her to cultivate her own ""free will"".  Nevertheless, Lila's ""darker side"" can be unrelenting and unforgiving— though she is usually calm, cool and coldly logical unless provoked!
Rob, a sneaky Russian hacker and wanted fugitive, can open any lock, crack any code, and solve any puzzle!  He is usually out for his own personal gain— unless his current goals just ""happen"" to align with DeVane, etc.  ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend?"" Rob would no doubt agree— but are his amazing abilities the result of his exposure to Astral energy as a small child?
DeVane is, well, DeVane— a ""man's man"" relic from the bygone era of bravado— take it or leave it!  An ex-NASA space-shuttle commander, DeVane spiraled into drunken obscurity— and out of his mind— after a space accident years ago that killed hundreds of people.  Now, he's back— and fixated on spoiling the plans of the evil Astrals and acting as a ""de facto"" mentor to Lila.  He's Dirty Harry, Rooster Cogburn, John McClane, and Snake Plissken all rolled into one!  How's that for a role model?  Cryptocurrency? Cisgender?  ...the Internet?  DeVane has no clue what you're talking about!
Jeannie is a NASA-shuttle-pilot-turned-academic-overachiever, and a single mom to Angelica.  Her intense drive to succeed in technology, aerospace, and medical sciences often results in strained relationships with her friends (ex-fiancée, DeVane) and her relatives (Angelica)— although her kind, caring, and generous nature makes up for it!  Often the ""voice of reason"", Jeannie is the ""glue"" binding them all together!
Angelica, a classic ""bad girl"", comes with a matching bad attitude to boot!  Born without the ability to hear or speak, she's not going to let those small deficiencies stop her from being a rebellious, badass, hell-raising teen-- much to the chagrin of her ""proper"" and ""squeaky-clean"" law-abiding mother, Jeannie!

 
Wait... these are the GOOD GUYS?
Yep, and that’s the appeal of ""Astral"" graphic novels— the quirkiness of these characters and their interactions is a gold mine for humor, something often found lacking in much of today's science fiction and action fare...
More importantly, however, no matter how dire any alien threat faced by Earth, our little band of misfit heroes (or anti-heroes?) must first confront a much greater challenge:
Can they resolve to set aside their differences, and learn to work together as a team?
...and, speaking of teams:
 

 
You're in good hands!
We're the Astral Team: A troupe of international artists and creators with hundreds of years of comics-industry experience between us!  We produce ASTRAL under the Pet Piranha Entertainment and Visionary Creative Services banners!


 
Jay, why are you doing this?
I'm passionate about ""Astral"", and over the years I've grown to absolutely love it-- as many others do-- and I'm sure YOU will, too!
The fact is, I'm a fully-independent creator of comics— without the multibillion dollar promotion, advertising, and distribution networks of those other ""big"" comic publishers.
By pledging for our books, you're not only supporting me and my team— you're making a direct contribution to the survival of small independent publishers like us— proving that quality storytelling and artwork can prevail in a hypercommercial world of mass-production dominated by rich and powerful corporations!
The way we're different is that, through the ""Astral"" graphic novels and their character-driven stories, we explore core themes about humanity and challenge the ""human condition""— by way of a gripping and action-packed thrill ride!  Also, explosions!
The cool part is: Unlike a lot of heavy-handed sci-fi books out there, the Astral adventures splash-in a little humor here-and-there, so it’s upbeat, engaging, and— most importantly-- FUN!
 

 
Best of all:
I’d like to offer YOU— the INDIEGOGO community, my friends and peers-- the opportunity to share in our adventures and support our work— and some of our super-cool and exclusive perks!


 

Purpose of Campaign Funds Raised
Funds raised in this campaign will go directly toward printing books and items associated with perks + postage, and the usual associated Indiegogo and payment-processing fees/costs.
































Risks and challenges
Having completed several crowdfunding campaigns already, I have a deep appreciation for what it means to launch a campaign and ask for your support!
I also have a keen understanding of how crowdfunding platforms work, having already completed fulfillment for our past campaigns, ""Astral Genesis"" and ""Astral Evolution"". As such, I'm confident that my team and I will be able deliver your rewards as promised, upon successful completion of the campaign.
In addition, my team and I have over 30 years' experience in comics and collectibles fulfillment— so please rest assured that we’ll have no problem shipping your books and other rewards to you promptly as soon as we receive them from our printer.
With overseas production there is always a possibility that delays can occur in the phases of printing, shipping, and customs inspections. As with our previous campaigns, I will be monitoring the process closely, and you have my assurance that if there is any schedule slippage, I will communicate it to you (along with our plan for addressing it) as soon as possible.
In addition, unforeseen circumstances and resulting delays may occur due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. If such conditions arise, I will communicate the situation— and our contingency plan— to you at my earliest possible opportunity.
Notice to backers residing outside of the United States who pledge for physical (mailed) rewards: We cannot be responsible for import/duty fees your home country may charge.  Thus far, we have not had any reports of import/duty fees from backers of previous ""Astral"" campaigns— but since other countries' import laws have the potential to change at any time (and without any notice to us), we cannot absolutely guarantee that it will not occur.
REFUND POLICY: Backers eligible for a refund under Indiegogo's Refund Policy may request one via that method. If a refund is not possible through Indiegogo's Refund Policy (or the backer is deemed ineligible) then refunds for this campaign are governed by the Pet Piranha Refund Policy, below. Note that purchases made via InDemand are governed by Indiegogo's Refund Policy for InDemand projects, and no refunds will be provided once the time period allotted for refunds under InDemand has elapsed.
PET PIRANHA REFUND POLICY: Backers may request refunds from Pet Piranha through the 15TH DAY after the campaign's final ""active date"" (or ""end date"") for raising funds. The amount refunded will be less any INDIEGOGO, payment-processing, and administrative fees— and all perks associated with the refunded pledge will be considered forfeited. After the 15th day post-campaign, no refunds will be provided by Pet Piranha, since all monies raised through the campaign will, at that time, be fully committed toward the fulfillment of the project.
PLEDGE WITH CONFIDENCE!
As always, all of your ""Astral"" rewards are fully backed by the ""Pet Piranha Entertainment Guarantee"" (see below). Please contact me if there is anything amiss with your rewards package, and my team and I will do whatever is within our power to make it right!
Your friend & fellow comics fan,
-Jay

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<p> </p>
<p>JUST ADDED!!! A NEW 6 page tale, The Case of the Littlest Dino! This is added to the MAIN BOOK as a thank you for supporting! Its a tale meant to mirror storytime with my daughter, and is about a little girl losing her pet dinosaur and going to get it back. Drawn by Peter Gilmore with words by LUG, TUG, and Gilmore! </p>
<p>STRETCH GOAL 1: At 20,000; The Case of The Littlest Umbrella will add the AMAZING Kyle Ritter as a colorist to the FRONT cover! Kyle has done work on projects like Cyberfrog, and it would be AMAZING to add his talent here! </p>
<p>STRETCH GOAL 2:  At 30,000; I will be adding SIGNATURES for myself to EVERYTHING. This is making sure that you not only get a comic, but a SIGNED comics!</p>
<p>STRETCH GOAL 3: At 40,000, MORE PAGES for the GOODIE BIRD TALE! This will allow us to give a few more pages to the tale and make it even better! </p>
<p>STRETCH GOAL 4: At 50,000. Signatures from TUG AND LUG. Now, I already plan to sign those comics, but what would be cooler than a ThatUmbrellaGirl signature on it? After all, her future is LOOKING BRIGHT in comics and having that later on? O yeah. </p>
<p>STRETCH GOAL 5: AT 70000. I will record a video that adds a read-through for BACKERS. That way, we have something for ANYONE wanting something fun with vocals, or needing assistance because of needs. </p>
<p>STRETCH GOAL 5: AT 100000: The BIG 6 FIGURES. At this level, we're adding something special. ESCAPE FROM DINO ISLAND. This will be added to the main book as a secondary story. 10 pages, Black and White to fit the theme. From Peter Gilmore. The cover art is in the ""updates"" section if you'd like to see it! </p>
<p>Part of the Goodie Bird explanation is hers as well, plus a few story notes here and there. So she IS part of our creative team! </p>
<p>Hey THERE!!! This is ThatUmbrellaGuy, teaming up with Keung Lee, to bring you a tale of Lovecraftian-based mystery, paying homage to  the things that go bump in the night! The tale begins with the idea of madness and something more trying to enter our world, and revolves around a certain detective and the cutest unwitting sidekick trying to stop it! We wanted to create something  EVERYONE can love and enjoy, and I also wanted to be able to give something to my daughter to enjoy as well.</p>

<p><strong><i>BLACK HOPS: U.S.A.-*-G.I</i></strong> is the ongoing comic book series about a covert strike force consisting of modern day cryptids. Their mission: to thwart an evil organization that specializes in the creation, capture, and weaponization of cryptids of their own. First published in 2018 by Antarctic Press, the characters in <i><strong>BLACK HOPS</strong></i> have gone on to cameo in other comics, such as <strong><i>Punchline</i></strong> and <strong><i>RAGS</i></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>TASK FORCE 22114: ""BLACK HOPS""</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>U.S.A.-*-G.I</strong>: After surviving an atomic bomb in the 1940's, the rabbit known as U.S.A.-*-G.I. displayed heightened intelligence and other skills, including optic camouflage, prolonged longevity, and the ability to communicate selectively with other creatures using an indecipherable carrier frequency. He has lived for generations with the Frelings, a career military family.</li>
<li>
<strong>PATRIOT-R</strong>: In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima reactor meltdown, an irradiated otter was found by United States cleanup personnel. He manifested the same heightened intelligence as U.S.A.-*-G.I. but is much more unpredictable and violent by nature.</li>
<li>
<strong>RIGOR TORTOISE</strong>: A multi-billion dollar experiment to artificially create the same set of skills displayed by U.S.A.-*-G.I. Ultimately the money was spent to augment a naturally intelligent terrapin with bionic enhancements and neural implants to be used as a trainable, walking weapon.</li>
<li>
<strong>Penelope Freling</strong>: The current owner of U.S.A.-*-G.I. and descendant of the man who first discovered him, she is bonded to him and is the only person capable of understanding his communication frequency. She has reluctantly joined BLACK HOPS and undergone training to be an independent contractor, serving as a translator and necessary backup.</li>

<p><strong>CRYTIQ HIGH COMMAND</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>APEX MOTH</strong>: The enigmatic leader and creator of CRYPTIQ, he was a scientist commissioned in 1966 to study and recreate the same conditions that made U.S.A.-*-G.I. A freak accident at his lab in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, turned him into an abomination. He wears a helmet to hide his visage. The leading expert on cryptids, his goal is to find, create, and bio-weaponize them for sinister purposes.</li>
<li>
<strong>HARE TRIGGER</strong>: Kanina Lovacova, CEO of the internationally renowned private military company NINGEN. Her company was responsible for keeping watch over Apex Moth while he was in captivity, but he successfully bribed her to join him and use NINGEN as CRYPTIQ's private army. Wanted by the United States for treason, she is currently traversing Europe as she avoids extradition.</li>

<p>This campaign is the debut of the 3rd installment of the<i> BLACK HOPS</i> saga: taking place almost a year after the events of <strong><i>BLACK HOPS VOLUME 2: HARE TRIGGER</i></strong> and serving as an interquel and bridge between<i><strong> KAMEN AMERICA VOLUME 1</strong></i> and <strong><i>KAMEN AMERICA VOLUME 2</i></strong>, the team is joined permanently by <strong>Penelope </strong>as the translator and backup for the team. They must infiltrate a castle in Europe to rescue a defector to the United States with critical information on CRYPTIQ.

<p>We pride ourselves on 2 years of successful crowdfunding and shipping in a timely manner: all of our books between 2019 and 2020 were delivered either a month early or on-time. However, the unique system by which IndieGoGo operates necessitates some personal policies to protect both you, the reader, and us the creators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital PDFs are sent within 24 hours of receiving funding from Kickstarter, which is usually <strong>14-17 days after the campaign ends.</strong> These files are sent via WeTransfer links, which expire after 7 days. Due to our busy schedules, we will honor the re-sending of links for up to 31 days after the first time the link is sent out. <strong>After 31 days, we are not responsible for backers</strong> who do not download our files: we have to be able to focus on other work without taking time out of our day to resend huge files to delinquent backers.</li>
<li>Physical books will be replaced if our tracking data shows that the parcel has not arrived within a reasonable period of time, or if significant damage was done to the books in transit. However,<strong> we are not responsible for book inquiries 3 months after the ship date</strong>. After 3 months, USPS will typically scrub tracking data. We cannot be dealing with shipping inquiries 6 months, a year, 2 years after the shipping date: that is not fair to us, nor is it fair to backers who have been monitoring the status of their orders. The onus of responsibility must fall on the customer to keep up with our updates regarding shipping schedules and other inquiries.</li>

BLACK HOPS: U.S.A.-*-G.I is the ongoing comic book series about a covert strike force consisting of modern day cryptids. Their mission: to thwart an evil organization that specializes in the creation, capture, and weaponization of cryptids of their own. First published in 2018 by Antarctic Press, the characters in BLACK HOPS have gone on to cameo in other comics, such as Punchline and RAGS.

TASK FORCE 22114: ""BLACK HOPS""


U.S.A.-*-G.I: After surviving an atomic bomb in the 1940's, the rabbit known as U.S.A.-*-G.I. displayed heightened intelligence and other skills, including optic camouflage, prolonged longevity, and the ability to communicate selectively with other creatures using an indecipherable carrier frequency. He has lived for generations with the Frelings, a career military family.

PATRIOT-R: In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima reactor meltdown, an irradiated otter was found by United States cleanup personnel. He manifested the same heightened intelligence as U.S.A.-*-G.I. but is much more unpredictable and violent by nature.

RIGOR TORTOISE: A multi-billion dollar experiment to artificially create the same set of skills displayed by U.S.A.-*-G.I. Ultimately the money was spent to augment a naturally intelligent terrapin with bionic enhancements and neural implants to be used as a trainable, walking weapon.

Penelope Freling: The current owner of U.S.A.-*-G.I. and descendant of the man who first discovered him, she is bonded to him and is the only person capable of understanding his communication frequency. She has reluctantly joined BLACK HOPS and undergone training to be an independent contractor, serving as a translator and necessary backup.




CRYTIQ HIGH COMMAND


APEX MOTH: The enigmatic leader and creator of CRYPTIQ, he was a scientist commissioned in 1966 to study and recreate the same conditions that made U.S.A.-*-G.I. A freak accident at his lab in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, turned him into an abomination. He wears a helmet to hide his visage. The leading expert on cryptids, his goal is to find, create, and bio-weaponize them for sinister purposes.

HARE TRIGGER: Kanina Lovacova, CEO of the internationally renowned private military company NINGEN. Her company was responsible for keeping watch over Apex Moth while he was in captivity, but he successfully bribed her to join him and use NINGEN as CRYPTIQ's private army. Wanted by the United States for treason, she is currently traversing Europe as she avoids extradition.



BLACK HOPS VOLUME 3
This campaign is the debut of the 3rd installment of the BLACK HOPS saga: taking place almost a year after the events of BLACK HOPS VOLUME 2: HARE TRIGGER and serving as an interquel and bridge between KAMEN AMERICA VOLUME 1 and KAMEN AMERICA VOLUME 2, the team is joined permanently by Penelope as the translator and backup for the team. They must infiltrate a castle in Europe to rescue a defector to the United States with critical information on CRYPTIQ. Unfortunately for them, CRYPTIQ is gunning for this asset as well and it's a race against time to see who gets the target first!






Along the way, the team will pick up new members -- including the highly trained COMMANDO-G -- as the stakes are raised between both sides!




Many of our recent readers have discovered BLACK HOPS for the first time thanks to the revealed tie-in from the epilogue of KAMEN AMERICA, VOLUME 1. As such, we are offering tiers that combine items with VOLUME 3 or with the OMNIBUS, which collects all 3 volumes of BLACK HOPS to date!

I work at Chick-fil-A, and I draw and create characters on the side. I've created a wide range of characters and story lines that I would love to publish in my own comic books. some day, when my fan base is built high enough, I would love to start producing movies for the comics. 
$250 will be used to print my first 100 comic books$1,000 will be used Illustration for the first comic book$250 for miscellaneous expenses
 
This campaign will help fund the creation of my first comic book. Then hopefully start a future world of characters. 
I am a young comic book writer, but I'm a very passionate writer, and seeing encouragement from other people about my work helps me push through.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h2>Let's Face It....The Future Is F#$@&amp;)</h2>
<h3>Maybe The People Just Might Need ""a little old fashioned""</h3>
<p>Imagine if you will, a Samurai and his beloved, also a Samurai. Together they have found in countless battles. Now they face an encounter unlike anything before. The Future. Stranded  in a more uncaring world than they left behind, Kiro and especially Myshi are like lambs ready for the slaughter.</p>
<h3>2100 Samurai is a story of two worlds, of two timelines.</h3>

<h3>
<br/>Help Launch Clownfish Comics!</h3>
<p>We're hoping to use <i>Shadowbinders</i> as a springboard to launch the <strong>Clownfish Comics</strong> imprint! We want to produce unique comics and graphic novels that aren't mainstream superhero titles or mopey Tumblr autobiographies. Clownfish Comics aims to produce comics for fans of animation, for gamers, and for pop culture enthusiasts that maybe don't read a lot of monthly books. We have more projects in the works -- stay tuned for announcements!</p>
<h3>

</div></div>","Steampunk! Fantasy! Romantic Comedy?!
Mia White was an ordinary high school girl with ordinary high school problems. That all changed the day she was given her grandfather's mysterious journal and an even more mysterious antique ring -- one that transports her to another world!
Now this ordinary girl finds herself in an extraordinary realm filled with airships, flying serpents and clockwork cities! But her biggest challenge may come in the form of handsome, aloof (and downright infuriating) mage Crimson Rhen... 
 

The Classic Webcomic Returns! 
SHADOWBINDERS first set sail in 2010 and ran until 2015 on its own domain, and later on Keenspot and WEBTOON. During its peak, the webcomic was regularly getting over one million pageviews per month. This two book graphic novel set is your second chance to pick up the definitive print edition of Shadowbinders in hardcover!

Created by Kambrea and Thom Pratt (aka Geeky Sparkles and Kneon)
Help launch the Clownfish Comics imprint!
Each 160 page hardcover book is 6"" x 9"" and in full color -- over 300 pages of material!
Book 1 contains Chapters 1-6 of the webcomic, and Book 2 contains Chapters 7-10.
Get caught up now for the return of Shadowbinders with all new material in Book 3 (Coming 2022)!
They'll be ready to ship almost immediately after Indiegogo releases funds!
Check out the teaser comic below for a taste of what the comic is about!










Help Launch Clownfish Comics!
We're hoping to use Shadowbinders as a springboard to launch the Clownfish Comics imprint! We want to produce unique comics and graphic novels that aren't mainstream superhero titles or mopey Tumblr autobiographies. Clownfish Comics aims to produce comics for fans of animation, for gamers, and for pop culture enthusiasts that maybe don't read a lot of monthly books. We have more projects in the works -- stay tuned for announcements!

Tier 1 - Shadowbinders Books 1 and 2
Our primary tier will be Shadowbinders Collection Vol. 1 and Shadowbinders Collection Vol. 2 shipped for $60.00 USD in the United States. Worldwide shipping is additional.

<h3> </h3>
<p>I am relaunching Volume One of Guardians of Erloth for two reasons. First, to give everyone another chance to get in on this incredible story from the beginning. Second, I hope to cover more of the costs associated with hiring an artist and letterer and printing the comic. I funded my first campaign mostly out-of-pocket because I have full faith in the story and wanted to fulfill my obligation to my amazing backers.</p>
<p>I am offering two versions of the comic book: cover A by the brilliant Keith Hinman and cover B by the phenomenal Caanan White. Can't decide? Get both! In addition to the comic books, you can also purchase some great perks including prints and posters. Check out all the tiers and options to the right!</p>

$1,500 STRETCH GOAL- Digital Character Preview- UNLOCKED
We would like to announce our first stretch goal! Once the campaign reaches $1,500, all backers will receive a special look at an upcoming character for Volume 2. This is a new character to the story and a first look at the next chapter in the Guardians of Erloth series. This perk will be sent to all backers once the campaign has been completed. 

 

 
My name is Chael Roberts and I am a first-time comic book creator. Writing is a passion I have been pursuing since my time in the US Navy. I am pleased to finally be able to bring one of my stories to life with the help of my artist, Ryan Best, and fans like you!
 

 
I am relaunching Volume One of Guardians of Erloth for two reasons. First, to give everyone another chance to get in on this incredible story from the beginning. Second, I hope to cover more of the costs associated with hiring an artist and letterer and printing the comic. I funded my first campaign mostly out-of-pocket because I have full faith in the story and wanted to fulfill my obligation to my amazing backers.
I am offering two versions of the comic book: cover A by the brilliant Keith Hinman and cover B by the phenomenal Caanan White. Can't decide? Get both! In addition to the comic books, you can also purchase some great perks including prints and posters. Check out all the tiers and options to the right!
 


 

 

 

 
You’ll definitely want a copy of this book if you...
...are a fan of fantasy.
...enjoy action-packed stories.
...appreciate amazing artwork.
...want to support indie creators.
...want to support indie artists.
 

 



 


 

No risk to you! Because this campaign is a relaunch of a previously printed book, you are guaranteed to receive your product(s) regardless of whether I reach my goal or not.
 



 
Already backed the book? Not ready to back at this time? No problem! You can still help me reach my goal by sharing this campaign. Make someone's day by introducing them to Guardians of Erloth today!

<p><i>Stalled Trek: The City on the Edge of Foreclosure</i> (COTEF, for short!) is an animated puppet parody of what is widely regarded as the original series' best episode! It's like an animated Mad Magazine parody with digital puppets.</p>
<p>The previous Stalled Trek parody was <i>Stalled Trek: Amutt Time</i> (a parody of ""Amok Time"") and was animated in 2012. I don't call this STALLED Trek for nothing! </p>
<p>That parody had its beginnings way back in 1995 when it started as a comic parody on my Star Trek fan page. In 2001, I made a full comic version of it and began work on a follow up comic ...which was COTEF.</p>
<p>Now I'm re-making them both as comics twenty years later, making the Stalled Trek name even more accurate. </p>
<p>I'm currently finishing up the animation on COTEF ...and for a home-made animated puppet movie, it's coming out even better than the first one. That's not a huge accomplishment, I'll grant you, but I want to make this one the Big One.</p>
<p>Thanks to the original funding, I'm making 250 Blu-Rays and I have the extremely talented Max McGuire scoring the film! </p>
<p>Which leads me to this second round of funding. Audio has been my Achilles Heel partly because I'm largely deaf in one ear and my good ear isn't great, either. Not a good scenario for mixing a film's audio.</p>
<p>Audio is 50% of the film experience and Max has been doing such a fantastic job with scoring, that I really don't want to sabotage that with inferior sound quality.</p>
</div><div>
<h2><strong>That's where you come in!</strong></h2>
<p>I'm starting this second round of funding so I can give the audio the best quality I can and since there's a limit of how many discs I have left over from the first campaign, I'm going back to Stalled Trek's comic roots!</p>
<p>Well, sort of, anyway!</p>
<p>If you're an older Trekkie like me, then you certainly remember the Star Trek ""Fotonovels"" from the 1970s, that turned twelve episodes of the original series into paperback photo-stories. Like comics, but using frames of film from the actual shows.</p>
<p>That's the idea here. And for the ultimate nostalgia, there's even a variant cover that parodies the covers of those original books!</p>

<h3>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe meet old school Heavy Metal Magazine! </h3>
<h3>If you love properties like MOTU, Thundercats, and Heavy Metal, then Serpent Handler is the right comic for you!</h3>
<p>I'm a 2011 Kubert School graduate who has committed my life to freelance cartooning and comics. Over the past few years I've worked on several licensed sketch cards for Topps and Upper Deck. That includes multiple one of a kind sketch cards for several Star Wars trading card sets for Topps, and one of a kind sketch cards for several Marvel Comics sets for Upper Deck.</p>
<p>I've penciled and inked a one shot pirate adventure comic for Blue Juice Comics, Anne Bonnie: Gummerblot Day, that will be in comic shops Summer 2019.</p>
<p>Serpent Handler started out as Badge Art for Zapp Con 3 in New Jersey. I've reversed engineered a whole wealth of ideas that I'd like to illustrate in comics to enjoy! There's nothing like creating and sharing narrative comics with others!</p>
<p>With your support, this will be the starting point for what will be a continuing series of Serpent Handler comics! </p>
</div><div>
<p>I initially need $5,000 to commit the time needed to draw the planned minimum 48 pages of content and cover. This will also allow me to print the comics, stickers, and prints to fulfill the orders. This will be a limited print run of 250 copies of this book! They will each be individually numbered.</p>
<p>If $10,000 is raised artist and colorist Anwar Hanano will color the book! We have to be able to pay him too for his hard work! Anwar is a fellow Kubert School graduate who has various credits with Archie Comics, DC Comics, and Toresh Games! </p>
<p>Projected completion date would be February 2020. That allows me the time needed to make the pages as great as I can make them in order for you to have a more stellar comic!</p>
<p>I have several perk tiers lined up, so check those out and choose what's right for you. We'll be adding more as we go along. Also, spread the word! Grass Roots!</p>
<p>If my initial goal of $5,000 isn't met, it would definitely prolong the projected/planned release and ship date. The more I raise essentially allows me the time I need to produce the art! If I don't reach goal I'd still print the exact amount of copies to fulfill orders, which is why my goal is so important!</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for reading, contributing, and spreading the word!</p>

While the city of Denver see's Cobalt as a hero, Vincent finds out he is almost as corrupt as the people they are throwing in prison. This causes Stryde to eventually quit his life of crime fighting and pursue other things. Years later and Vincent is pulled back into the fight by Cobalt when a mysterious organization called The Underworld settles in their town. </p><h3><strong>ASCENSION</strong></h3><p>Stryde: Ascension is the finale to Vincent's Stryde. It's a giant sized issue, with it being well over 30 pages, it makes it bigger than my previous two issues COMBINED. The majority of the story takes place in The Underworld, with Stryde and Cobalt taking on the villains Animus and Romulus. This issue is very action packed, so expect very fun interactions with these villains. This specific issue tackles the important side of being a hero that hasn't really been touched on in mainstream comics. </p><h3><strong>FULL STORY</strong></h3><p>Stryde: Full Story is the entire story of Vincent's Stryde. It has taken years but the entire story of Vincent's Stryde is in one book. It follows Vincent as a kid, to sidekick, all the way to and adult with a kid of his own.

<p>East Congo, 1849:  A baby gorilla is orphaned when a big-game hunter slaughters his entire tribe.  Placed aboard a boat to Europe, a kindly circus owner, Malloy, wins him in a card game and raises him like a son next to his daughter, Abigail, who names the tiny simian Kumba (an African word for ""roar""),</p>
<p>Texas, 1866. Kumba has grown to maturity and become the star attraction of Professor Malloy's Traveling Circus, putting on a spectacular show as the most novel trick shot artist West of the Pecos, the Six-Gun Gorilla! Abigail and Kumba yearn to see the big cities in the East, but Malloy wants to put as much space as possible between them and the Civil War.</p>
<p>The war, however, comes to them in the form of Giuliano Schmidt, a Union spy wounded and on the run from hired gun Gravesend and his gang of cut-throats. When Gravesend discovers that Malloy and his circus family have been helping Schmidt, he exacts a terrible revenge. Now Kumba takes up his guns and sets out on the vengeance trail, a journey that will lead him to unexpected places, old friends and a conspiracy that could change the course of history.</p>

<h3>About Us:</h3>
<p>Rhys here, for Ideal Comics. </p>
<p>The Ideal Comics crew has been making super-hero, horror, and comedy comics (all set in our shared universe), since 2006; but this is our first crowd funding. We are excited to bring you along with us as we share an unsung adventure from one of the first characters we created!<br/><br/>Our universe is full of superheroes, demons, monsters, and aliens intersecting in a world as down-to-earth as it is fantastic. <i>Tales of Shadow:  Sola Voce </i>is a story that crosses many of those intersections, and we are stoked to bring it to you. </p>
<p>Unfortunately in 2020, our original penciller became unable to continue, and so we had to start over with are from page one. I am providing the words for art by Barry Tetz.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>And what are we offering? Twenty-eight full color pages of monsters and mystery starring The Expositioner and some unexpected friends! Part procedural, part action, with character drama mixed, if you love classic comics of crime-solving and head busting, <i>Tales of Shadow: Sola Voce </i>is for you!</p>
<p>But that's not all! Every physical copy will come included with a centerfold poster by our team.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559394640/xfnhznkobmicvzx8e9t3.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">(not the final poster)</p>
<p>Additionally, we will be producing a nine card set of Ideal Comics trading cards. These cards will feature characters from the ""VoX Populi"" miniseries, as well as from our greater universe; and will feature art from Barry Tetz, Rico Cobos, and <strong>Peter Simeti</strong></p>

<p>Higher levels will also get a special in-universe ashcan that will be a separate, stand alone story!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While we have been making indie comics for print and the web for almost 15 years, we are excited to stretch our legs on this platform. Social Media is a whole  new world than existed when we began, and we have met so many great folks out there and hope you will come alongside us to create something great.</p>
<p><i>Tales of Shadow: Sola Voce</i> is a story that we have not seen much of in comics these days--a genuine detective story paired with all the over the top action that make super-heroes beloved. We believe their is a gap today's market for that kind of story, and we want to meet that demand!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559397443/zofrwg3j7u73mkfojq2q.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are asking $2000 for this project, which will cover our printing costs, give a little something for our team, and a nest egg to start Issue 2.</p>
<p>We are very excited for this project! So excited that we are running it on a shoe string! We want to get the comic into your hands! We want to hear you all talking about Expositioner around the water cooler! We believe so much in this project that we are committed to fulfillment! We are running a flexible funding campaign, which means Indiegogo will disperse funds if we cross $500. Our commitment to you is to get out your books even if we don't net a dime. We are working behind the scenes to get you your copy in March 2020!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We have tried to incorporate awards at many levels--something for everyone! But life is tough for everyone, we get that. If you believe in what we are doing, and you just can't afford to get our books, please be part of the dream!</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about <i>Sola Voce </i>and <strong>Ideal Comics</strong>.</li>
<li>Hit that link and share this Indiegogo!</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Progress So Far!</strong></h3>
<p>As we complete new pages, we will post low res versions here!</p>

Social Media is a whole  new world than existed when we began, and we have met so many great folks out there and hope you will come alongside us to create something great.
Tales of Shadow: Sola Voce is a story that we have not seen much of in comics these days--a genuine detective story paired with all the over the top action that make super-heroes beloved. We believe their is a gap today's market for that kind of story, and we want to meet that demand!

Risks & Challenges
We are asking $2000 for this project, which will cover our printing costs, give a little something for our team, and a nest egg to start Issue 2.
We are very excited for this project! So excited that we are running it on a shoe string! We want to get the comic into your hands! We want to hear you all talking about Expositioner around the water cooler! We believe so much in this project that we are committed to fulfillment! We are running a flexible funding campaign, which means Indiegogo will disperse funds if we cross $500. Our commitment to you is to get out your books even if we don't net a dime. We are working behind the scenes to get you your copy in March 2020!

Other Ways You Can Help
We have tried to incorporate awards at many levels--something for everyone! But life is tough for everyone, we get that. If you believe in what we are doing, and you just can't afford to get our books, please be part of the dream!

Though still an newbie talent, he has illustrated numerous comics for many small press publishers in the Netherlands such as Windmill-Comics and Comics of the West. Inspired by ancient mythology and current films Dinesh has a unique approach to depicting fast paced action and fighting scenes. Creating stories set in an ancient and strange past, and pitting massive armies against one another he is able to throw the reader straight into the conflict immersing them in the chaos.  His style mixes the japanese action manga and American superhero comics into a great blend of the two. In 2017 he released his first book “Drakan” where the epic scale of mass combat blends with ancient norse mythology introduced a unique world, first released in small segments in the Dutch anthology magazine “Holllandsch Metaal”.            If you are interested in seeing more of his work check him out at his links: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dinocomics4ever/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/dinocomics4ever/</a> <a href=""http://dineshart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://dineshart.com/</a>            If you’re interested in helping him develop more comics and getting more involved making the story then check out his Patreon: <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/dinocomics4ever"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.patreon.com/dinocomics4ever</a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600766405/vydcijhnklb5tjfxlush.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>FREE for All Physical Backers!!</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600766444/e8mtak4g92rcc8w7uius.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The comicbook is all written, penciled and colored.

As his contact list grew, so  did his interest in the  complete field of comic. Starting up a Bad Grrl Comics Fan club in 2001  was the first step to go further then his own living  room. Soon  thereafter he began setting up websites for Arthur Suydam,  Eric  Basaldua, Broadsword Comics and focussing on titles like  Vampirella,  Cavewoman, Hack/Slash and more... He even started working  with the FACTS comicon organization where he also met the founder of  Broken Frontier and  shortly thereafter began doing headlines for this  news site. Later he  founded the website COMICSFORSINNERS which more resembles his prior BadGrrl fanclub.  Nowadays Richard  dabbles in Art Agency, sending out comic Press  Releases and since 2019 publishing various comic books.J.L.

After this, he started  a complete story of The Creeps for a US editor. He has also  worked on various projects for Urban Rivals, Alien franchise, for  Legendary Encounters, Existenz X610z trading card, Arcana comics, Hammer light FX, Wireless Generation, Collision studio, Canal +, Millimages,  Golden moustache for Microsoft X-box One… and many other projects for  American editors, among which covers for Zenescope’s Wonderland and Lady Death...Since 2015, he lives at Montreal and  work principaly in Videogames Industry, as concept Artist and  Storyboarder.

Though still an newbie talent, he has illustrated numerous comics for many small press publishers in the Netherlands such as Windmill-Comics and Comics of the West. Inspired by ancient mythology and current films Dinesh has a unique approach to depicting fast paced action and fighting scenes. Creating stories set in an ancient and strange past, and pitting massive armies against one another he is able to throw the reader straight into the conflict immersing them in the chaos.  His style mixes the japanese action manga and American superhero comics into a great blend of the two. In 2017 he released his first book “Drakan” where the epic scale of mass combat blends with ancient norse mythology introduced a unique world, first released in small segments in the Dutch anthology magazine “Holllandsch Metaal”.            If you are interested in seeing more of his work check him out at his links: https://www.instagram.com/dinocomics4ever/ http://dineshart.com/            If you’re interested in helping him develop more comics and getting more involved making the story then check out his Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/dinocomics4everFREE for All Physical Backers!!The comicbook is all written, penciled and colored.

<p>Amazing news fellow Pakinslanders!!!</p>
<p>We've hit our $19K stretch goal, and we're so close to the summit of reaching our big $20K goal!</p>
<p>King Aryah has put out the call to the kingdom far and wide to ask if you can help us in reaching this grand milestone. Our gratitude and thanks go out to all of you that have made the Pakkins' Land Omnibus Campaign a success thus far, but we need your help in giving us an extra boost past $20K. As a way of saying Thanks to all of our loyal Pakkins' Land supporters, we've come up with a special limited time program that we think you'll like.</p>
<p>Here's how it works - <br/>Refer family, friends, or anyone that you think may enjoy becoming part of the Pakkins' Land family and supporting this campaign, and if they become a backer, you will get a special, limited-edition Pakkins' Land Adventure Patch created to commemorate the Omnibus campaign! This is our way of saying Thanks for going the extra mile in making our $20K goal a reality! This patch is exclusive and only available to our supporters who make the referral. That's it. It's that easy! So put the call out far and wide to family and friends, and let's hit the $20K goal and beyond!</p>
