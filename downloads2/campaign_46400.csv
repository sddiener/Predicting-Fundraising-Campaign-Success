<br/><strong>HOW THE IDEA WAS BORN.</strong>
</h3><p>Sometimes, it is only a short step from product to accessory… a shorter and easier step than you can imagine! The real challenge consists rather in determining a starting point, something that makes taking “that step” worthwhile! A stimulus, an idea, a thought which is too insistent to be ignored! A thought like FreakishCLOCK: a carefree, “fresh” and immediate wall clock. </p><p>The original idea was based on a simple principle: making an analogue clock which was as easy to read as a digital clock. Just one simple advantage: to be easy to read, for everyone – young and old alike! Designed to focus on the current time and little else: just on simplicity, neatness and immediacy; a little ‘window’ on the current time: the FreakishSegment, the section that “reads the time”! Basically, a “digital hand”.</p><p>... Stretching a line, finding the right measurements, drawing and erasing, in the attempt to reach the goal that only a few have ever reached: to get from product to accessory! The move had been made, the aim was very clear: FreakishCLOCK had to be made into an accessory! A small and elegant window on time, following you throughout the day, at all times.</p><p>A watch for everyone - an everyday object, and not just a home decor item! At work or at leisure - just by casting a fleeting glance at it - the watch will set the pace of your day with immediacy and charm.</p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483007794/o9zuh1swjmlf0wuofaia.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><div> </div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNHohm-PVdE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Okhrj4s0zT8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-XdT-hnItw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dmyPAHaMg4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> *For a better visualization, please put the video in HD resolution.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>HOW TO GET IT.</strong></h3><p>Help us to bring FreakishWATCH to life!

For everyone and every situation.
HOW THE IDEA WAS BORN.
Sometimes, it is only a short step from product to accessory… a shorter and easier step than you can imagine! The real challenge consists rather in determining a starting point, something that makes taking “that step” worthwhile! A stimulus, an idea, a thought which is too insistent to be ignored! A thought like FreakishCLOCK: a carefree, “fresh” and immediate wall clock. The original idea was based on a simple principle: making an analogue clock which was as easy to read as a digital clock. Just one simple advantage: to be easy to read, for everyone – young and old alike! Designed to focus on the current time and little else: just on simplicity, neatness and immediacy; a little ‘window’ on the current time: the FreakishSegment, the section that “reads the time”! Basically, a “digital hand”.... Stretching a line, finding the right measurements, drawing and erasing, in the attempt to reach the goal that only a few have ever reached: to get from product to accessory! The move had been made, the aim was very clear: FreakishCLOCK had to be made into an accessory! A small and elegant window on time, following you throughout the day, at all times.A watch for everyone - an everyday object, and not just a home decor item! At work or at leisure - just by casting a fleeting glance at it - the watch will set the pace of your day with immediacy and charm.   *For a better visualization, please put the video in HD resolution. HOW TO GET IT.Help us to bring FreakishWATCH to life!

However, even with our now years of experience with klokers, given the degree of innovation that KLOK-08 represents, the risks of this campaign are:</p><p>- technical risk of KLOK-08 dial colors: the watches presented on these pages are prototypes. Considering the state-of-the-art technologies used, the industrial phase may make changes to the KLOK-08 dial colors. This will not however affect the aesthetical quality of KLOK-08.</p><p>Besides, klokers reserves the right to change one color or even not provide some color references at all if these ones have not been enough requested. In such a case, klokers may provide another model.</p><p>- industrial risk: in the watchmaking industry, the extremely high precision of components is essential. The technical team will be paying very close attention to respect of tolerances, precision, and quality of components. It is possible that the manufacturing tolerances could change depending on the challenges and difficulties encountered to comply the components’ specifications. The necessary mastery of the production ramp-up phase may also cause changes to the delivery schedule.</p><p>- financial and economic risk: klokers is a successful but a young company which constantly adapts to the evolutions of its exploitation and environment (market, legislation, norms, etc.). This environment may affect the development of the company and postpone some elements of the production planning.</p><p>- Indiegogo risk: for campaigns in InDemand, backers can request a refund from Indiegogo within 10 days of the transaction provided the InDemand page is live, the perk has not been fulfilled, and the funds have not been disbursed to the campaigner.</p><p>All contributions will be engaged for the manufacturing and the industrialization of KLOK-08. These funds will be committed for this purpose. As backers on Indiegogo, reimbursement for the pledge is only possible as mentionned above. Delays in deliveries cannot be a reimbursement reason. In the Indiegogo context, the backers do accept these risks as they support a project under development.</p><p>Deliveries should start from December 2018 and can last, according to total quantities backed on Indiegogo, until the end of Q1 2019.</p><p>If any of the information provided in this document changes then we will notify all of our backers in a transparent and timely manner.</p></div>","The new klokers’ Swiss Made watch KLOK-08 is available through Indiegogo.

The disks display time on a vertical line at the top of the dial.KLOK-08 flies in the face of the traditional watchmaking in that the disks rotate counterclockwise! klokers used innovative state-of-the-art technologies and conducted extensive research and development in developing KLOK-08 and perfecting the concept of simple but secure interchangeability.The fixing system and time display are both patented.Reference for the fixing system patent: WO 2016/001598Reference for the time display patent: WO 2017/042456 The patented fixing system - the klokers' key:An integrated lens in the triple injected glass ensures high legibility when reading the time:Patented 316L stainless steel fixing system with red push-button at 8 o’clock to unlock KLOK-08 from its support (strap or accessory):Exploded view of KLOK-08  (non-contractual picture as KLOK-08 is still under development, the construction presented below is a provisional version):KLOK-08 is a certified Swiss Made watch at an affordable price.The non-conventional and proprietary assembly process required an overall investment of €1M. ____________________You will receive your KLOK-08(s) and accessory(ies) in an elegant protective travel case. This case has foam drawers to protect your KLOK-08 from shocks and ensure a safe journey.You can adjust compartments in the travel case according to your choice of products.Colors: cream, black and red Dimensions: 169 mm (long) x 169 mm (wide) x 25 mm (high)Materials: cardboard and foam You can help us to successfully launch KLOK-08 by joining our Time Travelers Guild!  And sharing the campaign throughout your social media channels! Thank you for this valuable help, and welcome into the Time Travelers Guild! Risks and challengesIn September 2015, klokers was born on Kickstarter and, after successful crowdfunding and the wild experience of startup life, has grown up. However, even with our now years of experience with klokers, given the degree of innovation that KLOK-08 represents, the risks of this campaign are:- technical risk of KLOK-08 dial colors: the watches presented on these pages are prototypes. Considering the state-of-the-art technologies used, the industrial phase may make changes to the KLOK-08 dial colors. This will not however affect the aesthetical quality of KLOK-08.Besides, klokers reserves the right to change one color or even not provide some color references at all if these ones have not been enough requested. In such a case, klokers may provide another model.- industrial risk: in the watchmaking industry, the extremely high precision of components is essential. The technical team will be paying very close attention to respect of tolerances, precision, and quality of components. It is possible that the manufacturing tolerances could change depending on the challenges and difficulties encountered to comply the components’ specifications. The necessary mastery of the production ramp-up phase may also cause changes to the delivery schedule.- financial and economic risk: klokers is a successful but a young company which constantly adapts to the evolutions of its exploitation and environment (market, legislation, norms, etc.). This environment may affect the development of the company and postpone some elements of the production planning.- Indiegogo risk: for campaigns in InDemand, backers can request a refund from Indiegogo within 10 days of the transaction provided the InDemand page is live, the perk has not been fulfilled, and the funds have not been disbursed to the campaigner.All contributions will be engaged for the manufacturing and the industrialization of KLOK-08. These funds will be committed for this purpose. As backers on Indiegogo, reimbursement for the pledge is only possible as mentionned above. Delays in deliveries cannot be a reimbursement reason. In the Indiegogo context, the backers do accept these risks as they support a project under development.Deliveries should start from December 2018 and can last, according to total quantities backed on Indiegogo, until the end of Q1 2019.If any of the information provided in this document changes then we will notify all of our backers in a transparent and timely manner.",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

Using SMS, HERA will only answer to the managing phone. The software will require login information in order to track the phone. </p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">6) How big is HERA? Is it available in different sizes?</span></h4><p>Currently, HERA is 4 cm (1.5 inches). We are working to make it smaller, or at least wider than it is tall. It will be available in one size that will fit a wide variety of people.</p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">7) Will my child be able to turn HERA on or off? Will I receive a notification if HERA is turned off?</span></h4><p>The child can turn off the phone, but it will only affect the phone’s ability to make outgoing calls. Through the managing phone or software, the parent will still be able to use GPS tracking, hear what is going on around the child, and make calls to the child.</p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">8) When will I get to choose the color of my HERA?</span></h4><p>At the end of the project, backers will be contacted to confirm color choices. In addition to child-friendly colors, we hope to create a black or white option that will appeal to senior citizens, or adults with special needs.</p><p>9) Do I need to add shipping costs manually?</p><p>Yes, shipping costs must be added to your selected perk. When you pledge, manually add US$10 to receive your perk in the US, or US$30 to receive it in another country.</p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">10) I forgot to manually add shipping. How can I correct this?</span></h4><p>No problem. Click on “Contribute Now” at the top of the page. Manually enter US$10 to receive your perk in the USA, or US$30.00 to receive it elsewhere. Enter the same personal information as you did in your initial order, and it will be added to your pledge amount.

With GPS capabilities and only four programmable buttons on the keypad, it is both easy for children to use and convenient for parents to monitor. Created for Safety As a parent, I have always been deeply affected by stories of missing children; so much so, that whenever the TV news would feature kidnapped or lost children, I would have to change the channel. I didn't want to imagine the panic and desperation that a family would face being separated from their child. For years, I have worked as a developer, and I knew that I had an opportunity to create something meaningful; something that could change the world for the better. I began working on a project to improve the lines of communication between children and parents. Out of this, HERA was developed.Designed with children in mind. Through testing many prototypes, we have discovered essential components of a phone designed for children: Easy to use. With only four preprogrammed buttons, a child as young as one year old can make a call. Unlike a mobile phone placed in a pocket or backpack, the watch is constantly visible to children, and easily accessed when they need it. Compatible with an active lifestyle. Children are constantly active; running, jumping, falling, and moving around. While other prototypes such as a mobile phone necklace were affected by the constant motion, the HERA watch phone is durable and uninhibited by children’s activities.Adaptable for all ages. Children at different stages have different needs and abilities. A very young child has little independence, and no need to use a phone on a regular basis. An older child might need to contact a parent with questions or information.With its GPS technology, HERA works well for young children to wear on outings, such as trips to the mall or park. For older children who walk to and from school and activities, it can be worn daily. HERA is especially useful for children of any age to wear on international trips.Designed for your peace of mindHERA is designed to ﬁt your lifestyle as a parent, and to allow you to easily contact and locate your child. As the project grows, we will be able to offer an increasing amount of features to make the phone even more efﬁcient and effective.We got funded, Hera will be delivered with at least  this features; CALL FIREWALL The phone will be programmed to only receive calls from pre-authorized numbers.SECRET CALL High quality speakers and microphones will allow parents to hear what is happening around their child. GPS SYSTEM GPS location technology will alert parents either by SMS or online when the child arrives at or leaves a preprogrammed place. Location can be tracked online at all times. LBS SYSTEMLBS location system compliments GPS by using cell phone tower antennas to verify position. Unlike GPS alone, LBS allows location to be tracked indoors, and in heavy cloud cover.                                                                LOW RADIATION HERA will have a very efﬁcient system for reducing radiation. The emission of radiation will be reduced to 0.28mW/g; one seventh of the European standard$100,000;                                                              IOS SOFTWARE HERA will include a software allowing it to be controlled using iPhones and iPads                                                              CHOOSE THE SECOND COLOR HERA will be available in a second color, chosen by the backers $200,000;                                                                ANDROIDS TOO HERA will include a software allowing it to be controlled by Android phones                                                                ONE MORE COLOR HERA will be available in a third color $350,000;                                                                REMOVAL ALERTSHERA will alert parents of the child’s position when the watch is removed                                                              4 COLORS TO CHOOSE FROMHERA will be available in a fourth color$500,000;                                                              WIRELESS RECHARGEABLE The phone will be chargeable at a wireless charge table (sold separately)*We are seeking backers at another website as well. If we reach $300,000 from this campaign and $200,000 from our other one, we will be able to deliver HERA with the features listed at the $500,000 mark. Patent PendingWe have filed requests with the International Patent System, the International Trademark System, and the International Design System. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS1)  Can HERA be used exclusively as either a GPS tracker or a phone rather than both?HERA has both GPS and cellular phone capabilities, but you can choose to use it exclusively as a GPS tracking device.2) How long is battery life?Our goal is to make the battery life as long as possible; at least two full days with frequent use, and one week in standby.3) Will I be notified if my battery is running low?You will be able to program the phone to send an SMS alert when the battery is running low.4) Will HERA be waterproof or water resistant?At the very least, HERA will be water resistant. We will work towards making HERA as waterproof as possible.5) How can I ensure that I have exclusive access to my child’s GPS location, and no one else can track my child?The phone can be tracked by SMS, or through the included software. Using SMS, HERA will only answer to the managing phone. The software will require login information in order to track the phone. 6) How big is HERA? Is it available in different sizes?Currently, HERA is 4 cm (1.5 inches). We are working to make it smaller, or at least wider than it is tall. It will be available in one size that will fit a wide variety of people.7) Will my child be able to turn HERA on or off? Will I receive a notification if HERA is turned off?The child can turn off the phone, but it will only affect the phone’s ability to make outgoing calls. Through the managing phone or software, the parent will still be able to use GPS tracking, hear what is going on around the child, and make calls to the child.8) When will I get to choose the color of my HERA?At the end of the project, backers will be contacted to confirm color choices. In addition to child-friendly colors, we hope to create a black or white option that will appeal to senior citizens, or adults with special needs.9) Do I need to add shipping costs manually?Yes, shipping costs must be added to your selected perk. When you pledge, manually add US$10 to receive your perk in the US, or US$30 to receive it in another country.10) I forgot to manually add shipping. How can I correct this?No problem. Click on “Contribute Now” at the top of the page. Manually enter US$10 to receive your perk in the USA, or US$30.00 to receive it elsewhere. Enter the same personal information as you did in your initial order, and it will be added to your pledge amount. We will match the pledges and shipping costs manually at the end of our campaign.11) When are you going to be shipping my HERA?The estimated shipping date for both national and international orders is December 2014.12) I asked for my perk to be sent to my address, but I want to send it as a gift to another address. What do I do?At the end of the campaign, we will contact each of our contributors to confirm their product choice. At this time, you can respond with the correct shipping address. 13) How can I be sure that you will deliver?We have already produced HERA. Currently, it works as a GPS and phone, but does not include all of the features that we will be able to provide through this campaign. Although we can deliver now, the funds raised through this campaign will allow us to improve our product. We will be able to afford high quality engineers, and implement advanced research and development. Additionally, we will be able to use higher quality materials, and introduce exciting new features. We are fully committed to making HERA the superior product we know it can be.I am originally from Brazil, but I have been traveling the world to develop this product. My company is located in Wilmington, Delaware USA; this will be the development and delivery center for HERA. The phone has evolved into what it is today with help from many skilled workers located in the USA, Canada, India, and China.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

HELLO and thank you for taking the time to have a browse at what
I'm trying to achieve. I'm Helen, I work as an actress when the jobs come in
and the rest of the time I go slightly mad! This project came into fruition
from the need to be constantly creative and the love of making people feel
wonderful.
To give you an idea where and why this project has come about
and why it is so important to me- I need to take you back in time to November
and a hop skip and jump over to Hong Kong. 'Secret Island Party' is the name of
the music and arts festival my friend Rachel founded in Asia. I had the
pleasure of attending the festival last year and the even bigger pleasure of
creating a headdress fit enough for the hostess of the party!

Getting dressed up for festivals is one of my favourite
pastimes. Dressing other people up for festivals I revel in even more. The
open-minded crowds that attend festivals allow such freedom to play and express
and it is this good feeling that I want to heighten through my fashion designs.
I made the headdress for Rachel in the chaotic communal corridor
of an old house dedicated to the production team on the island. With a hot glue
gun, a glass of wine and a couple of mosquitoes for company I got to work.
Using artificial sparkly flowers, leaves, birds, butterflies, more flowers and
a vine to wrap around the arm, I created a piece that was completely over the
top and magical.

insides! As the festival went on lots of people commented on how much they

making Kimonos, jewellery, turbans, leotards, having a shop at a festival,
doing a charity catwalk, taking part in some jewellery courses, making beach wear,

“I want to create pieces that are rich in the beauty of female
strength. That are connected to and taking inspiration from dynamic women
throughout the ages. That are bold, playful and empowering.”
""Matriarch"" said my friend.
And that’s how the name came about.

Over the last few months I have been developing the idea,
through sketches, mood boards, making headdresses out of whatever I can
find in my craft box, attending business planning workshops and gathering information on-line.
As I’ve soon discovered, I need help! With the old acting work

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>Do you have a head? Does your head have ears? Yeah? Well it has the wrong kind! </p>
<p>With this Indiegogo project, my goal is to get everybody the right pair of ears. Whether it be a hat, tail, or a hoodie, your wild side will show through! </p>
<p>My name is Merm, and I'm an aspiring designer. I'm currently studying apparel design at the University of Minnesota's College of Design. I've always loved putting together costumes and reenactment attire, but it's usually so expensive and time consuming to make that it gets too costly for anyone to afford! That's why I developed patterns for three basic items-- a hat, a tail, and a hoodie. These are items that can be worn anywhere, be it a convention, the mall, or even out in the cold.</p>
<p>After finding the lowest possible price for my creations, I now offer them to you!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/61125/files/20130908143653-Capture.PNG?1378676213"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3>The Donations</h3>
<p>Making the apparel always been a gamble. What if fabric prices rise?   What if I undercharge and end up paying out of pocket? I really wanted to find a way to be able to sell my products at an affordable price so that everybody could rep them, but how would I do that without losing money?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is your support.</p>
<p>Now you may be wondering, what does one do with $6,000? Well, let's take a quick look at the costs to manufacture the items. The industrial sewing machine itself is upwards of $2,000. Hoodie fleece is $12.99/yard, while regular fleece is around $9.00/yard. Meanwhile, faux fur is closer to $24.99/yard. One yard of fabric doesn't do very much, so the fabrics need to be ordered in large quantities. The cost of stickers and buttons is close to $600 and that's not to mention the amount of thread, elastic, and other sewing necessities such as quality scissors. Don't forget shipping costs! Keep in mind that FREE SHIPPING is offered for orders within the United States!</p>
<p>In exchange for your generous donations, you will receive one (or two, or three, or four!) of these items: A hat, a tail, or a hoodie. Each comes in either black cat, wolf, fox, or white cat. These are my own original design and will be handmade with love for each and every one of my backers!<br/>Each package above $5 will also include a 1"" button and a sticker.<br/></p>

Martin has always been destined for fashion greatness.  Graduating from Howard University in Washington, DC with a  Bachelor's of Arts in Fashion Merchandising. Martin then moved to the fashion Capital New York, studying at the Fashion Institute of Technology and currently studying at Harrington College of Art and Design.  
Once in New York, Martin worked as a designer for the following brands, Sean John, Fashiman & Tobin, Liz Claigorne, IZOD, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Macy's, Lord & Taylor, and Company 81, Oved Apparel.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hello my name is Ashley. I haven't long turned 21 and I'm a UK based self- taught male designer located in the green lands of Norfolk, Kings Lynn to be more exact. I specialise in hand crafting bespoke masks and headwear with an all unique couture fashion twist. Mostly I go by the label <strong>'Mystic Magic' </strong>- maybe you might have already heard of me? </p>
<p>Feel free to check out my official website, <a href=""http://www.mysticmagiconline.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.mysticmagiconline.co.uk</u></a> <br/> <br/>Since last year I've slowly started to venture more into clothing design while dabbling in my artistry talents. At the moment I'm delved in the process of creating my biggest and excitedly awaited first full featured collection to be aimed at London Fashion Week, (once it's completed!), Code name <strong>'REDEMPTION'</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431028655/fedpndaffoo4nzr7ygk1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 494.39px;height: 666px;""/></p>
<p>For as long as I can remember I've been full of creative imagination and able to see past the obvious. Where most people would see a pile of junk I'd think of it as a playground full of treasures. </p>
<p>My parents never brought me up to be spoiled so I was always making my own toys and mostly playing in the mud (Fun Times). If ever they couldn't find me I'd no doubt be hiding in a cardboard box pretending that it was a Wendy house!</p>
<p>When I moved up to high school I had to deal with the traumatic loss of my grandfather plus all the stresses that come with adapting into a new crowd of unfamiliar territory. It was only a matter of time before the bullies descended like a ravenous horde of Vultures tearing in to my light. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I created Mystic Magic as a safe haven to escape to
when everyone in the world seemed to have abandoned me. It was there where I
sort comfort in creations from my own imagination to give
purpose and make sense of the darkness that had unforgivably fallen upon my
mental state of wellbeing. Eventually removed from schooling and
plagued with numerous breakdowns, my confidence was stripped barer than
the bones that lay beneath the ground. I was subjected to harsh
cruelty that left me in a very dark place. It was only then at my
lowest point I sort to a glimmer of light burning sharp like the
delicate flames of a candle. I sacrificed the last remnants of my fractured
heart in the hopes to feed the fire to burn bright as the night
sky shining as one amongst the stars enveloping Mystic Magic into the business
it is today, a beacon of hope to all those that stand wounded beneath the feet
of others showing our life is in our own hands not theirs. They may name
and shame us but in the end we get to choose which path to
take. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431032229/f8avqbrceryqxqei9avt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I've started up this campaign in the hopes to help achieve
the completion of my first full collection. For me this is no
ordinary project as it represents my journey through the gates
of limbo. Like a gothic fairytale filled with darkened despair, every
creation designed down to the tiniest detail represents an emotional part of me
that has long since been caged within eating away at my glowing light as if it
was a demonic disease destroying every part of what made me human. It's
taken many years to get to the state of finally being ready to let go and
leave all the shadows behind moving onto a new chapter of life full of happy
and brighter things. <strong>""Like a phoenix I shall rise from
the ashes"" </strong>This collection will be the means to an end and the beginning
to a life changing transition that needs your support in order to succeed.</p>
<p>By creating this collection and unleashing it upon the world, it will
allow me to lay bare my scars and release all the hatred that has shrouded
my life for so long, turning something truly ugly into a work of beautiful
artistic expression. Words cannot even begin to describe how much this
whole project means to me on a spiritual level and the self healing
it will achieve whilst boosting my confidence and self belief.</p>
<p>All I can ask is for you to have faith and trust within me as I warningly
hold open my hands to take anyone who is willing upon an unforgettable journey
that's is sure to break boundaries in the world of fashion. My mind knows no
limits to what can be achieved if given the right support and help from others
that believe in me.</p>

<p></p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div>For this project to be successful in keeping up the
quality of design work that I’m aiming to achieve, I’m looking to raise around £3080
or more if I should be seen lucky enough!</div><p>Some of the key components the funding will be put
towards include, </p><ul>
<li>cost of materials and embellishments</li>
<li>Support from
dressmakers/pattern cutters. <strong>(I'll initially be doing all the dress making myself as this is my project but if I should come to an area out of my exsperties then I'll have a budget put by to help out)</strong>
</li>
<li>the lovely crochet lady who lives down the road
from me</li>
<li>a doll maker who has the most amazing uniqueness</li>
<li>and one of the most important key features for one of my
designs is a beautiful faux fur coat inspired by Cerberus, a three headed dog
that guards the gates to the underworld, (Trust me it’s going to be unforgettable!).
</li>
</ul><div>
</div><p>I’ll also be looking to hire a videographer to help
create an artistic short fashion video to help bring my creations to life
and have as an introduction to the collection before coming out on the
catwalks. There will also be photography done too for promotional and
advertisement purposes. </p><div>
</div><p>I’ve already planned and am looking ahead in researching
costs for services and have been given quotes from various collaborators to help
give me an idea on how to allocate funding. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431101077/sj9jmz938fp8nkmyatbj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>One of the main features in this project as you may have already gathered is
to collaborate with various artists and crafters to not only showcase my work
at its best but also there’s too, creating a unique platform that will provide
individual opportunities having possibly never been offered to them
before. <strong>I love to help others and get talented people involved.</strong></p>
<p>Some more unique features to my collection that is sure to make it
stand out from anything seen before showcases use of a variety of unimaginable
materials such as a Charleston dress made from ruff cut crystals and animal
bones! A fly net covered in dazzling diamonds, ghostly honey bees, 3D printing,
Doily dresses, candles and that’s just the normal stuff! </p>
<p>During the catwalk show itself the models will be in a state of dramatic
role play creating a mesmerising atmosphere foretelling the stories behind
their characters while putting on a breathtaking showcase of creative infused
fashion. Mourning bride, fallen angels, a sinful nun, ballerina, urban Jesus,
the duchess and plenty more... tallying up to a total of 15 looks eagerly awaiting
to breathe life into the world. </p><p><br/></p>

donating towards our creative project I’ve created a quirky set of
perks that is sure to brighten up even the darkest of days. Just a little

holds the key to finding... </p>
<p>When I was a child I was so full of carefree happiness even though under the

and like an empty vessel the void was filled with something that really wasn’t me.
My collection will help to rid myself from the last remains of this darkness allowing
me to ascend to a higher state of mind starting a new journey where as
individual I’ll be able to support and use my talents to help others in giving
them hope and power to not allow the same events to control their lives.
Showing them that you don’t have to settle with second best of what the others
make you out to be and <strong>YES</strong> it is alright to dream big as you only get to live
this unique life once. Not a single moment show be wasted nor stolen. </p>

_____________________________________________________________________________
Mystic Magic has awoken yet again to create a high fashion gothic collection filled with history, cultural couture, Angels, Demons, Mourning Brides and much more!...
With using materials sourced from across the globe, toe bones and sequined laces from America, Ruff cut crystals from Lithuania, 3D printing from Spain and luxury fabrics from my England home.
Designs inspired by the religiously undead and those who are trapped within the horrors of limbo itself. Forever forced to walk the earth between two colliding worlds of darkened unrest, frozen in a circled moment of time.
I bring to you an all exclusive collection, set to transform the face of Mystic Magic itself bring us out of the fairytale and into a new dimension. It's time to descend into my world of,



Short Summary 
Hello my name is Ashley. I haven't long turned 21 and I'm a UK based self- taught male designer located in the green lands of Norfolk, Kings Lynn to be more exact. I specialise in hand crafting bespoke masks and headwear with an all unique couture fashion twist. Mostly I go by the label 'Mystic Magic' - maybe you might have already heard of me? 
Feel free to check out my official website, www.mysticmagiconline.co.uk  Since last year I've slowly started to venture more into clothing design while dabbling in my artistry talents. At the moment I'm delved in the process of creating my biggest and excitedly awaited first full featured collection to be aimed at London Fashion Week, (once it's completed!), Code name 'REDEMPTION'.


For as long as I can remember I've been full of creative imagination and able to see past the obvious. Where most people would see a pile of junk I'd think of it as a playground full of treasures. 
My parents never brought me up to be spoiled so I was always making my own toys and mostly playing in the mud (Fun Times). If ever they couldn't find me I'd no doubt be hiding in a cardboard box pretending that it was a Wendy house!
When I moved up to high school I had to deal with the traumatic loss of my grandfather plus all the stresses that come with adapting into a new crowd of unfamiliar territory. It was only a matter of time before the bullies descended like a ravenous horde of Vultures tearing in to my light. 


I created Mystic Magic as a safe haven to escape to
when everyone in the world seemed to have abandoned me. It was there where I
sort comfort in creations from my own imagination to give
purpose and make sense of the darkness that had unforgivably fallen upon my
mental state of wellbeing. Eventually removed from schooling and
plagued with numerous breakdowns, my confidence was stripped barer than
the bones that lay beneath the ground. I was subjected to harsh
cruelty that left me in a very dark place. It was only then at my
lowest point I sort to a glimmer of light burning sharp like the
delicate flames of a candle. I sacrificed the last remnants of my fractured
heart in the hopes to feed the fire to burn bright as the night
sky shining as one amongst the stars enveloping Mystic Magic into the business
it is today, a beacon of hope to all those that stand wounded beneath the feet
of others showing our life is in our own hands not theirs. They may name
and shame us but in the end we get to choose which path to
take. 



I've started up this campaign in the hopes to help achieve
the completion of my first full collection. For me this is no
ordinary project as it represents my journey through the gates
of limbo. Like a gothic fairytale filled with darkened despair, every
creation designed down to the tiniest detail represents an emotional part of me
that has long since been caged within eating away at my glowing light as if it
was a demonic disease destroying every part of what made me human. It's
taken many years to get to the state of finally being ready to let go and
leave all the shadows behind moving onto a new chapter of life full of happy
and brighter things. ""Like a phoenix I shall rise from
the ashes"" This collection will be the means to an end and the beginning
to a life changing transition that needs your support in order to succeed.
By creating this collection and unleashing it upon the world, it will
allow me to lay bare my scars and release all the hatred that has shrouded
my life for so long, turning something truly ugly into a work of beautiful
artistic expression. Words cannot even begin to describe how much this
whole project means to me on a spiritual level and the self healing
it will achieve whilst boosting my confidence and self belief.
All I can ask is for you to have faith and trust within me as I warningly
hold open my hands to take anyone who is willing upon an unforgettable journey
that's is sure to break boundaries in the world of fashion. My mind knows no
limits to what can be achieved if given the right support and help from others
that believe in me.




   What We Need & What You GetFor this project to be successful in keeping up the
quality of design work that I’m aiming to achieve, I’m looking to raise around £3080
or more if I should be seen lucky enough!Some of the key components the funding will be put
towards include, 
cost of materials and embellishments
Support from
dressmakers/pattern cutters. (I'll initially be doing all the dress making myself as this is my project but if I should come to an area out of my exsperties then I'll have a budget put by to help out)

the lovely crochet lady who lives down the road
from me
a doll maker who has the most amazing uniqueness
and one of the most important key features for one of my
designs is a beautiful faux fur coat inspired by Cerberus, a three headed dog
that guards the gates to the underworld, (Trust me it’s going to be unforgettable!).


I’ll also be looking to hire a videographer to help
create an artistic short fashion video to help bring my creations to life
and have as an introduction to the collection before coming out on the
catwalks. There will also be photography done too for promotional and
advertisement purposes. 
I’ve already planned and am looking ahead in researching
costs for services and have been given quotes from various collaborators to help
give me an idea on how to allocate funding. 
One of the main features in this project as you may have already gathered is
to collaborate with various artists and crafters to not only showcase my work
at its best but also there’s too, creating a unique platform that will provide
individual opportunities having possibly never been offered to them
before. I love to help others and get talented people involved.
Some more unique features to my collection that is sure to make it
stand out from anything seen before showcases use of a variety of unimaginable
materials such as a Charleston dress made from ruff cut crystals and animal
bones! A fly net covered in dazzling diamonds, ghostly honey bees, 3D printing,
Doily dresses, candles and that’s just the normal stuff! 
During the catwalk show itself the models will be in a state of dramatic
role play creating a mesmerising atmosphere foretelling the stories behind
their characters while putting on a breathtaking showcase of creative infused
fashion. Mourning bride, fallen angels, a sinful nun, ballerina, urban Jesus,
the duchess and plenty more... tallying up to a total of 15 looks eagerly awaiting
to breathe life into the world. 

Your Perks!
In
donating towards our creative project I’ve created a quirky set of
perks that is sure to brighten up even the darkest of days. Just a little
way for me to personally say Thank You and to show that your support really means the world...

<p><b>Hi Crowd Funders</b></p>
<p>Firstly let me thank you for spending your time checking out
the VYZA grab strap. VYZA is the clever sun visor mounted vehicle storage
solution for holding sunglasses, mobile phones almost anything, have a look at
our video and I'm sure you will understand why our initial customers say that
they firstly dont know why this hasn't been done before and secondly how they
got by without it!</p>
<p><b>Thanks again!</b></p>
<p><b>Jim and the team at VYZA</b></p>
<div></div>
<div>If you have any questions or feedback please don't hesitate to e-mail us at info@vyza.com.au</div>

<p></p>
<p><b>WHY WE CREATED THE VYZA GRAB STRAP</b></p>
<p>After twenty years in the eye-wear industry people kept
telling me how they always damaged their sunglasses in their car by sitting on
them or leaving them in the glove box or console.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443501628/kb2jb5rc8immufnnvwba.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>From this VYZA was designed, during the testing phase it soon became apparent that VYZA was not only great at safely securing sunglasses  but could also hold mobile phones, wallets, garage door openers, reading glasses almost anything which solved the same problem people all over the world experience of unsecured items being damaged or hard to locate in their vehicles. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443771249/mbu2uwkrfdepsalcnnjg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></div>
<div></div>
<p>The VYZA grab strap is fully adjustable to fit all vehicle
types, simply use the adjustment loops to set your size and slide your VYZA
into position on your sun visor.</p>
<p>VYZA incorporates three innovative ""GRIP STRIPS""
on the inner surface to ensure whatever you need VYZA to hold stays in place.</p>

<p>Our research shows that anyone who spends time in their
vehicle would benefit from using a VYZA. It stands to reason though that those
that spend an extended period in their vehicle would find VYZA most useful
people like.</p>
<p>- Couriers</p>
<p>- Bus and Truck drivers</p>
<p>- Taxi &amp; Uber drivers</p>
<p>- Emergency services workers</p>- Sales
representatives </div><div><br/></div><div><b>VYZA NOT JUST FOR CARS?</b></div><div>
<p>Not only have our initial customers told us how great the
VYZA works in their cars they have also told us they have used their VYZA for
things we never thought of.</p>
<p>How about holding your pad, phone  and reading glasses
together when you get out of your car?</p>
<p>Travelling? Use your VYZA to keep your documents, wallet,
tickets together.</p>
<p>How about holding your snow skis together when you're
walking to the lifts?</p>
<p>Someone even used their VYZA as an emergency dog collar.</p>
<p>Whatever it is if you have a crazy new way to use your VYZA
let us know.</p>

Firstly let me thank you for spending your time checking out
the VYZA grab strap. VYZA is the clever sun visor mounted vehicle storage
solution for holding sunglasses, mobile phones almost anything, have a look at
our video and I'm sure you will understand why our initial customers say that
they firstly dont know why this hasn't been done before and secondly how they
got by without it!
Thanks again!
Jim and the team at VYZA

WHY WE CREATED THE VYZA GRAB STRAP
After twenty years in the eye-wear industry people kept
telling me how they always damaged their sunglasses in their car by sitting on
them or leaving them in the glove box or console.

From this VYZA was designed, during the testing phase it soon became apparent that VYZA was not only great at safely securing sunglasses  but could also hold mobile phones, wallets, garage door openers, reading glasses almost anything which solved the same problem people all over the world experience of unsecured items being damaged or hard to locate in their vehicles. 




HOW IT WORKS

The VYZA grab strap is fully adjustable to fit all vehicle
types, simply use the adjustment loops to set your size and slide your VYZA
into position on your sun visor.
VYZA incorporates three innovative ""GRIP STRIPS""
on the inner surface to ensure whatever you need VYZA to hold stays in place.









The VYZA grab strap can hold just about anything in your car and keeps it in close proximity so those important objects are never out of reach.





WHO NEEDS A VYZA?

Our research shows that anyone who spends time in their
vehicle would benefit from using a VYZA. It stands to reason though that those
that spend an extended period in their vehicle would find VYZA most useful
people like.
- Couriers
- Bus and Truck drivers
- Taxi & Uber drivers
- Emergency services workers- Sales
representatives VYZA NOT JUST FOR CARS?
Not only have our initial customers told us how great the
VYZA works in their cars they have also told us they have used their VYZA for
things we never thought of.
How about holding your pad, phone  and reading glasses
together when you get out of your car?
Travelling? Use your VYZA to keep your documents, wallet,
tickets together.
How about holding your snow skis together when you're
walking to the lifts?
Someone even used their VYZA as an emergency dog collar.
Whatever it is if you have a crazy new way to use your VYZA
let us know.

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
Now the design work is done and the initial manufacturing
run complete our goal is to get this great product out to the market place not
only in Australia but worldwide.
The problem we have is after
spending more than twelve months on getting the VYZA project to this stage our
cash reserves are exhausted.
In order for us to realise the next stage we need your
support in helping fund a larger manufacturing run and the search for
distributors around the world.
The great news is by helping us we can help you by offering
you VYZA grab straps in return for your support, check out our perks for

people of all ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses to continuously transcend

  I’m using IndieGoGo to help me raise
$5,500 which will provide me with the balance of funds needed to establish a
legit fashion line (DEMONSTRATE) and supply a line sheet to major fashion
retailers. Camera lenses, fabrics, notions, raw materials for jewelry and an
eCommerce website will all be purchased / built with these funds. In the rare
event that I don't reach my goal in its entirety, I'll disburse the funds in a
manner which will help me get closest to my goal in the shortest amount of time.

We are 5 individuals from 5 different countries. Every one of us witnessed a war in his or her country and was lucky enough to have an opportunity to escape the war and find a new Life in Germany.
We all went to middle school together and became close friends through the years. The War took away our childhood… Witnessing a war where your family members or friends got killed in front of your eyes or losing your house with everything you love, is something that no child in the world should go through.
We do not want to draw the attention on us personally, we want to bring attention to the Project and the cause. We see this Indiegogo Project as a chance to let our pain go, by designing Fashion that moves the world in a positive way.
People, who grew up in peace, can’t imagine what it’s like for children to actually witness war and be confronted with death in this young age.  Watching TV and hearing about decisions which country should be bombed next is something that we at QuitWar don’t understand…
We know that War is not the solution; it’s the cause of many problems for humanity and therefore we want to get our voice heard and fight in our own creative and personal way! WE COUNT ON YOUR HELP!
 
OUR VISION
QuitWar is the Voice for Millions of children that have been present at events far beyond the worst nightmares of most adults... With your help we want to Launch QuitWar and make T-Shirts, Longsleevs and Bags with the QuitWar Logo and spread them in the whole world!
 
THE PRODUCT



 
HOW WILL WE DO IT? 

We work together with a manufacturer from Germany who is a strong supporter of our Project.

We have a young talented fashion designer in our Team, who is working on future Designs.

We will make an International Online-Shop with different Products (The variety depends on how much money we will receive)

We will update everyone on Facebook & Twitter on the Status of our Project and blog about charity projects that we are involved in.

We will collect pictures of people world wide who are wearing the T-Shirt and supporting QuitWar and make an photo album that we will send out to all institutions that are involved in a war today.

With the help from a good friend of us who is a known International Music Producer, we will push our T-Shirts into the Music Industry and have Artists wear the shirts in public to draw more attention in the media.
 
OUR INITIAL GOAL

<p>We know you want to show off your watch, so we are working hard to get them manufactured and ready to ship as soon as possible. We refuse to send you anything but the highest quality product!</p>
<p><b>Will the screen crack?</b></p>
<p>The screen is made out of tempered glass and will not crack unless there is a VERY heavy impact. If it does crack, let us know and we will either fix it or replace it. </p>
<p><b>Is there a warranty for the 1:Face watch?</b></p>
<p>Yes. There is a 1-year warranty. If there are any defects, our repair center will fix it or replace it. However, we strive to provide the highest quality materials so this will not be an issue.</p>
<p><b>How long does the battery last?</b></p>
<p>The watch battery lasts up to two years. </p>
<p><b>Can the battery be changed?</b></p>
<p>You can definitely replace the battery. Take it to any watch repair shop in your city and they'll be able to do it for you easily.</p>

<p>Yes, water resistant 3 ATM. </p>
<p><b>Are the watches available in retail stores?</b></p>
<p>Not yet, but soon! 1:Face :M will be available in retailers in 2016. </p>
<p><b>What percentage of donations go to the charities?</b></p>
<p>Each watch comes with a metric which is carried out with the purchase of the watch.  We want to make the business model as transparent as possible and never want you to have to ask the question ""And then what?""  With that said we will not only tell you what, we will show you what!</p>
<p>For example, for every white watch purchased, Faces of Change will provide 20 children in Kenya with food.  The same holds true for each of the other metrics. The goal is to create an actual quantified change in people's lives around the world for each watch sold.</p>

<p>The watches are designed at the Mirza Minds headquarters in Chicago, IL &amp; assembled in Shenzhen, China. The facility has passed the SA8000 (Social Accountability) and ISO14000 (Environmental) audits. Furthermore, our manufacturing facility is ROHS compliant.  </p>

<p>
<a href=""#C4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Jump to FUNDING BREAKDOWN</a>
</p>
<p><b>To start with, thanks
for taking the time to open up our campaign and look into it.</b></p>
<p>Our company is a
“semi-start-up” fashion brand which initially began while we were living and
working in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Ju_j0Y2ozXbyXDyNMrE4A/ls.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p>Us, the founders, are
me, Marlena Guzowski from Canada and my partner Rizwan (Riz) Zafar from
Pakistan.</p>
<p>We met in Dubai where our thought was that men, and especially middle
class/upper middle class guys are overlooked in the fashion industry.  We
wanted to create smart casual and cool clothes for guys between the average
ages of 25-50; guys who still wanted to look cool but not dress in cheap ‘teen
store’ clothing. These men have some disposable income and want high quality
but are not in the ranks of ‘Armani or Gucci’ purchasers.  They are the
majority of our population and yet the majority of stores, rather than catering
to this middle-class professional guy who needs cool every day clothes, sell
either cheap cost, cheap quality (and usually cheap looking) clothing, or
high(er) quality but overly expensive clothes.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rizandmarlena.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/25.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p>We started with some
trials in Pakistan where production is more expensive than in places such as
China but is generally 100% natural fibers and many things are still handmade
when done on a smaller scale.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rizandmarlena.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSC_0340.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p>We first opened up 2
stores in Lahore, Pakistan where we produced by the people and sold back to the
people. We design all our clothes with the help of  a
professional and very talented tailor who now also works as our General Manager on the Pakistani
side of things.</p>
<p>After about a year our
goal became to bring our products to the western world and what better place to
build a reputation than the capital of fashion – Milan, Italy.</p>
<p>Besides building up a
reputation as a true, high quality brand we also chose Milan due to the gaping
lack of middle-class clothing in Italy.  Known as the capital of fashion,
the majority of the population is simply middle class individuals working
regular jobs. Conversely, most of the clothing stores in Italy are either
highly over-priced or the exact opposite; very cheap, low quality products. It
is nearly impossible to find decent quality at a decent price. Additionally,
the extra hurdle for men in Milan is trying to find 'regular' clothes. The
majority of stores either cater to full-out suits or super casual, teen wear.
Anything in between is a rarity.</p>
<p>We have found a gap in
Italy; a gap which actually exists in most countries but is just much more
prominent here. <br/></p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is
to return to North America and expand our stores in Canada and the US, keeping
the same mentality as we started with; the production of high quality, natural
clothing for middle-class men between the average ages of 25-50. We want to
become an international clothing brand that real men can afford but are still
proud to wear.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rizandmarlena.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSC_0386.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p>Outside of our business goals we hope to make a positive impact on the people we work with. We have
started working on a small scale in Pakistan, helping families pay for the
education of their children as well as funding independent producers of textiles by purchasing their equipment, such as industrial sewing machines etc...</p>
<p>Of course, all
businesses need to make money to survive, however, our number 1 prerogative is
not the highest profits possible, but reasonable profits for high quality items
and the possibility to give back and work with the world around us.</p>
<p>Obviously we make
basically zero in profits in Pakistan (due to their economy as well as the
inflation and exchange rate). However, we have managed to pool our money and
open up our first store in Milan, Italy. We have now been open around 2 months
and things are going well but of course we need to look at months of bare
survival before our business can support itself.</p>
<p>Additionally, to lower
production and shipment costs as well as to gain audience trust we need to have
more visibility  than just one small store. We need to ‘look and feel’
like a real brand. In order to do this, we need a minimum of another store in
Milan within hopefully the next year and ultimately 3 stores within the
city. Extra funds can also allow us to produce a greater variety of
clothing immediately, which in turn will allow us to gain a reputation quicker
and therefore grow faster.</p>
<p>Trying to do this with
our own finances is brutally hard and being in one of the most expensive cities
in the world means that we are barely scraping by.</p>
<p>If you believe in our
image and our conviction that with some help and extra start-up funds we can
become something great and lasting, help us, and in return we will give you
some amazing perks and gifts. <strong>Go to the perks section to find out
what awesome perks we have for you.</strong></p>
<p><b>The Funds:</b></p>
<p>In the funding section
we have broken down as simply as possible the funds necessary for the upkeep of
our first store for approximately another 6 months (after which it is projected
to be able to support itself), and separately the funds necessary to open
up a second store and run it for about 9 months (again, the projected amount of
time that it needs to begin supporting itself). We’ve tried to be as
transparent as possible while refraining from killing our audience with scores
of pages of financial calculations. If you need/want any more details regarding
any aspect please feel free to contact us and we will give you as much detail
as you require to make an educated decision.</p>
<p>We hope to open up 3
stores in Milan in the shortest time span possible, however, if we can obtain
help with the first 2 we will be able to get to the opening of the third store
on our own.</p>
<p>Anything helps. We will look for any and all means possible to gain the funds necessary for
these two first stores. Everything we receive will get us one step closer and step by
step we will succeed.  So thank you for helping us take these steps!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Our first store in Milan officially opened at the beginning
of June, 2014. The month of our opening was based predominantly on locating and
obtaining a good commercial location at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>This was the month during which the street was shut down for
construction and will remain so until February 2015.</p>
<p>In the long term this is a very positive thing as major
improvements are being done in this commercial neighbourhood in anticipation of
Expo 2015 which will be in Milan beginning May 2015 and is expected to bring in
around 40 million tourists.</p>
<p>However, for the short term, and especially for the first
months of survival of a store this is a huge difficulty. Outside of trying to collect the total of 150, 000 Euros for expansion and growth, we really need assistance in covering our quarterly rent in October. If we could obtain the funds at least for this rent, which is 12K, we will have the time necessary to look for more funding solutions.</p>
<p>In its first month, the store earned around 1200. In its
second month it earned 2000. We predict that in around 6 months it will earn
enough monthly to pay for itself as well as production costs etc…</p>
<p>We therefore need funding to maintain the store for another
6 months. </p>
<p>Whatever the store earns for the next 6 months, on top of
the funding, will be partially used to provide us with some basic salaries
(which, since last year, we have not been able to have) as well as quicker
growth.</p>
<p>If we receive enough funding we will also open a second
store as soon as possible, in order to build up visibility before Expo 2015.</p>
<p>The financial breakdown is based on costs in Milan, which
may or may not compare to your city of residence/work. For example, commercial rent in Milan is taxed
at 22%. Therefore, each month you pay rent + 22%. For the rental of commercial
properties the general rule of thumb is also the payment of 3 months deposit +
3 months forward, which may also vary depending on what country you reside in.
If a specific cost does not make sense to you, please ask and we will clarify.</p>

To start with, thanks
for taking the time to open up our campaign and look into it.
Our company is a
“semi-start-up” fashion brand which initially began while we were living and
working in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
Us, the founders, are
me, Marlena Guzowski from Canada and my partner Rizwan (Riz) Zafar from
Pakistan.
We met in Dubai where our thought was that men, and especially middle
class/upper middle class guys are overlooked in the fashion industry.  We
wanted to create smart casual and cool clothes for guys between the average
ages of 25-50; guys who still wanted to look cool but not dress in cheap ‘teen
store’ clothing. These men have some disposable income and want high quality
but are not in the ranks of ‘Armani or Gucci’ purchasers.  They are the
majority of our population and yet the majority of stores, rather than catering
to this middle-class professional guy who needs cool every day clothes, sell
either cheap cost, cheap quality (and usually cheap looking) clothing, or
high(er) quality but overly expensive clothes.
We started with some
trials in Pakistan where production is more expensive than in places such as
China but is generally 100% natural fibers and many things are still handmade
when done on a smaller scale.
We first opened up 2
stores in Lahore, Pakistan where we produced by the people and sold back to the
people. We design all our clothes with the help of  a
professional and very talented tailor who now also works as our General Manager on the Pakistani
side of things.
After about a year our
goal became to bring our products to the western world and what better place to
build a reputation than the capital of fashion – Milan, Italy.
Besides building up a
reputation as a true, high quality brand we also chose Milan due to the gaping
lack of middle-class clothing in Italy.  Known as the capital of fashion,
the majority of the population is simply middle class individuals working
regular jobs. Conversely, most of the clothing stores in Italy are either
highly over-priced or the exact opposite; very cheap, low quality products. It
is nearly impossible to find decent quality at a decent price. Additionally,
the extra hurdle for men in Milan is trying to find 'regular' clothes. The
majority of stores either cater to full-out suits or super casual, teen wear.
Anything in between is a rarity.
We have found a gap in
Italy; a gap which actually exists in most countries but is just much more
prominent here. 
Our ultimate goal is
to return to North America and expand our stores in Canada and the US, keeping
the same mentality as we started with; the production of high quality, natural
clothing for middle-class men between the average ages of 25-50. We want to
become an international clothing brand that real men can afford but are still
proud to wear.
Outside of our business goals we hope to make a positive impact on the people we work with. We have
started working on a small scale in Pakistan, helping families pay for the
education of their children as well as funding independent producers of textiles by purchasing their equipment, such as industrial sewing machines etc...
Of course, all
businesses need to make money to survive, however, our number 1 prerogative is
not the highest profits possible, but reasonable profits for high quality items
and the possibility to give back and work with the world around us.
Obviously we make
basically zero in profits in Pakistan (due to their economy as well as the
inflation and exchange rate). However, we have managed to pool our money and
open up our first store in Milan, Italy. We have now been open around 2 months
and things are going well but of course we need to look at months of bare
survival before our business can support itself.
Additionally, to lower
production and shipment costs as well as to gain audience trust we need to have
more visibility  than just one small store. We need to ‘look and feel’
like a real brand. In order to do this, we need a minimum of another store in
Milan within hopefully the next year and ultimately 3 stores within the
city. Extra funds can also allow us to produce a greater variety of
clothing immediately, which in turn will allow us to gain a reputation quicker
and therefore grow faster.
Trying to do this with
our own finances is brutally hard and being in one of the most expensive cities
in the world means that we are barely scraping by.
If you believe in our
image and our conviction that with some help and extra start-up funds we can
become something great and lasting, help us, and in return we will give you
some amazing perks and gifts. Go to the perks section to find out
what awesome perks we have for you.
The Funds:
In the funding section
we have broken down as simply as possible the funds necessary for the upkeep of
our first store for approximately another 6 months (after which it is projected
to be able to support itself), and separately the funds necessary to open
up a second store and run it for about 9 months (again, the projected amount of
time that it needs to begin supporting itself). We’ve tried to be as
transparent as possible while refraining from killing our audience with scores
of pages of financial calculations. If you need/want any more details regarding
any aspect please feel free to contact us and we will give you as much detail
as you require to make an educated decision.
We hope to open up 3
stores in Milan in the shortest time span possible, however, if we can obtain
help with the first 2 we will be able to get to the opening of the third store
on our own.
Anything helps. We will look for any and all means possible to gain the funds necessary for
these two first stores. Everything we receive will get us one step closer and step by
step we will succeed.  So thank you for helping us take these steps!
FUNDING BREAKDOWN

Our first store in Milan officially opened at the beginning
of June, 2014. The month of our opening was based predominantly on locating and
obtaining a good commercial location at a reasonable price.
This was the month during which the street was shut down for
construction and will remain so until February 2015.
In the long term this is a very positive thing as major
improvements are being done in this commercial neighbourhood in anticipation of
Expo 2015 which will be in Milan beginning May 2015 and is expected to bring in
around 40 million tourists.
However, for the short term, and especially for the first
months of survival of a store this is a huge difficulty. Outside of trying to collect the total of 150, 000 Euros for expansion and growth, we really need assistance in covering our quarterly rent in October. If we could obtain the funds at least for this rent, which is 12K, we will have the time necessary to look for more funding solutions.
In its first month, the store earned around 1200. In its
second month it earned 2000. We predict that in around 6 months it will earn
enough monthly to pay for itself as well as production costs etc…
We therefore need funding to maintain the store for another
6 months. 
Whatever the store earns for the next 6 months, on top of
the funding, will be partially used to provide us with some basic salaries
(which, since last year, we have not been able to have) as well as quicker
growth.
If we receive enough funding we will also open a second
store as soon as possible, in order to build up visibility before Expo 2015.
The financial breakdown is based on costs in Milan, which

3 months forward, which may also vary depending on what country you reside in.

<p>Our undershirts aren't white. Why?! So they don’t show through under a white or light-colored shirt. Thanks to the low V-neck, Sizable undershirts stay invisible, even with an extra button opened.

Confidence, Comfort & Style brought to you by Sizable!

About a year ago, we faced the exact same
problem as our friend Joe. At Sizable, we believe that underwear shouldn't stop
you from being confident.Therefore, we created and designed Sizable - Invisible Undershirts in Brussels, the capital of Europe. What makes it truly revolutionary, is that
Sizable provides a tailor-made solution for every man. We understand that people come in different body shapes, but no problem: we took care of that.

Sizable is available for the three body types, indicated with following logo's and names: 

                             




Jim: The tall, slim guy - available in S, M & L


Joe: Average Joe with standard posture - available in M, L & XL


Jack: Lumber Jack, with athletic posture - available in S, M & L








Our undershirts aren't white. Why?! So they don’t show through under a white or light-colored shirt. Thanks to the low V-neck, Sizable undershirts stay invisible, even with an extra button opened. Because of the slightly longer fit, the undershirt stays tucked in and doesn't bunch up under your shirt.



Sizable takes care of your body, which is
why only the most ecological and high quality fabrics are used, bamboo and
organic cotton. Bamboo fibers are extremely soft, for a comfortable feeling.Did you know that bamboo absorbs three to four times more moisture than any other fabric?




Sizable undershirts will truly change your life.
And you know, the best thing about it is that people won’t even notice it, but
they will see the difference. We need your help to continue our journey
in providing a tailor-made solution that will bring confidence, comfort and
style to the modern man. 




   What We Need & What You Get 
With your support, we want to raise 6.000 EUR to bring our products to the market. Thanks to your support, Sizable will be able to further expand the product range and produce extra series of undershirts and bamboo garments. Today, we give you the opportunity to receive one of the first made-to-fit Sizable undershirts.
True adventure seekers can opt for a sweat-proof skydive experience or be the star in our next photo shoot! 




Extra crowdfunding offer: Bamboo socks
Exclusively for our Indiegogo funders: Sizable super soft Bamboo socks.
True love is like a pair of socks: you gotta have two and they've gotta match. We will provide bamboo socks in black or navy blue color. Available in size 39-42 and 43-46.






Pick-up party!
Instead of receiving your products by mail (and pay for shipping costs), we invite you to raise a glass with us and receive your order, directly after the crowd funding campaign. On the 15th of May, you will be one of our honored guests at the unforgettable Sizable launch event, near Brussels.
In case you cannot join us, you can alternatively add an optional 5 EUR (or 15 EUR for international shipping) shipping cost in the Additional Gift category.

   The Impact 
Sizable produces all of their products in a responsible way, with respect to the highest standards of quality & sustainability.  At Sizable, we use superior bamboo, a natural fabric with minimal impact on the environment.

  
Other Ways You Can Help Sizable already contracted several stores in Belgium, but our ambition is to sell worldwide!  If one of your friends hasn't discovered Sizable - Invisible Undershirts yet, please help him and give him the confidence and style he deserves. Support us by spreading the word and help us achieve our ambitions!

<p>The aim of our project is to prove the practicality of replacing ski resorts' conventional one-time-use wasteful paper trail maps with the eco-friendly, recyclable and reusable NaviSki.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal and how the funds will be used...</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to provide enough NaviSkis to between three and five ski resorts next winter as a pilot project demonstrating how the resorts can cost-effectively further their efforts to go green!</p>
<p>The funds will be used on a three tiered basis. The first use will go toward the printing, folding and mounting of sample maps like the one below.</p>
<p><span class=""notranslate""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7085/7250019186_2189c3b3b3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p>The second tier use will allow us to attend the National Ski Areas Association trade show in early May where we will present the concept to ski resort owners and general managers. The final tier funds will go for the purpose of offseting the cost of tooling and producing multi-cavity injection molds for the housing unit to replace our current single-cavity mold, <span class=""notranslate"">which would include specialized insert plates to create resort-specific logos for the face of the housing.</span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/023/395/984c914c2dbe1d805d4fb3e4e74cdf5e_large.jpg?1339301891"" src="""" style=""""/></span></span></p>
<p>Using the latest high tech materials, NaviSki is our decidedly <em>low tech</em> solution to the problems of both paper waste (more on that below) and the inconvenience of the current road-map style of ski map now in use. It's not a sexy new app, but we think it's kinda cool, super convenient and <em>so</em> easy on the environment! With the exception of the elastic band, every element of Naviski is made of recyclable plastic. Even the ""paper"" is environmentally friendly produced plastic; and you can read more about that further down as well.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so we've had some fun demonstrating the convenience of NaviSki in the video, and while we think this is a pretty deft solution to all of our clumsy map problems, we also have our eye on a far bigger and more important issue.</strong></p>
<p>That large, folded-up paper trail map that the resort ever so kindly gave you when you purchased your lift ticket comes with a serious environmental price. Not their fault. It was what it was. But consider the numbers for a minute. Each one of those maps is roughly the size of four, 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper. With over 300 ski resorts in the United States hosting around 16 million skiers and snow boarders who purchase over 60 million lift tickets, that's a lot of paper, not to mention ink, which, at the end of the day, ends up in the garbage... which ends up in landfills, or sometimes, the maps wind up flying around the mountain as twirling trash twisting in the wind. So just how much paper is that? With upwards of 10 million maps printed up each year and with paper being 0.004 inches in thickness, that amounts to quite a hill of beans. Sorry not a hill... but a mountain. In fact, it's pretty close to a stack of paper over thirteen thousand, two hundred feet tall. So if you were standing on the peak of East Wall at Arapahoe Basin Ski Resort, at thirteen thousand fifty feet, you would have to look <em>up</em> to see the top of that stack of paper.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/042/105/573ed6de89d193dbf8930653c2b25589_large.jpg?1340505145"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><span class=""notranslate""> </span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate"">Part of the funds will go toward producing a multi-rack perforation die larger than our homemade prototype that you see here, for cutting the maps into their uniquely foldable shape, below.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranslate""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/006/604/c31a50dbc64200bbf8e5f958a7b2ce66_large.JPG?1338271194"" src="""" style=""""/></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/006/639/a03dc2ea621564bd940e01e490b71e7c_large.JPG?1338273165"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">The artwork for the maps is already completed but the printing, perforating and mounting within the housings must be executed as well.</span></p>
<p>To achieve the best possible cost effectiveness, minimum order quantities from the manufacturer are necessary to secure the lowest available per unit price. That low cost will be passed along to the resort in order to remain competitive with the current conventional maps. It's important to remember that because of its reusability, the number of NaviSkis in use at a resort will be far smaller than the quantity of paper maps needed to service the same number of skiers. And that will reduce even further, the resort's expenditure for their maps. That speaks to their bottom line as well as their desire to be environmentally friendly. All we ask of our fellow skiers and riders is that they drop 'em in a convenient barrel on their way out for reuse the next day.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize here that in order to both lessen our environmental footprint by eliminating unnecessary transportation and fuel consumption and provide as many jobs as we possibly can in the local economy, NaviSki will be made entirely in America.</p>
<p>If we prove successful, we can then embark on an effort to expand the use of NaviSki industry-wide and finally eliminate that mountain of paperwork we outlined above. With your help, that goal can be achieved and we will have done our small part to improve life on this lovely blue planet of ours.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>OKAY A LITTLE TECHNICAL STUFF:</strong></p>
<p>For the ""paper"" maps we use a 100% tree and pulp-free synthetic paper, which results in conservation of forests, water and natural resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>No ozone-threatening emissions result from the synthetic paper's manufacturing process.</li>
<li>The manufacturing facility in Chesapeake, Virginia has been recognized for excellence in the handling and discharge of waste water.</li>
<li>Crafted of tree-free polypropylene pellets, the ""paper"" is 100% recyclable.</li>
<li>Using the recommended methods, the recycling of the synthetic paper generates no sulfur, nitrogen or dioxin gases.</li>
<li>Internal processes are continually reviewed at every stage to maximize environmental stewardship and minimize our carbon footprint.</li>
<li>Very little water is used in the creation of the paper, which results in the preservation of Earth's water resources.</li>
<li>The paper's durability and attributes yield a map that will have extremely long wear and stay out of the waste stream longer.</li>
<li>Trim created during the manufacturing process is recycled and reintroduced in the production of further maps.</li>
<li>The pulp-free, tree-free synthetic paper is free of toxins and heavy metals, producing yet another environmental benefit.</li>
</ul><p>There you have it. Thank you for taking the time to give us a look-see. Here's hoping that together, we can prove the feasibility of replacing paper maps with recycled plastic to help conserve our resources... one NaviSki at a time!</p>

<p> </p></div>","What we're trying to do...
The aim of our project is to prove the practicality of replacing ski resorts' conventional one-time-use wasteful paper trail maps with the eco-friendly, recyclable and reusable NaviSki.
Our goal and how the funds will be used...
Our goal is to provide enough NaviSkis to between three and five ski resorts next winter as a pilot project demonstrating how the resorts can cost-effectively further their efforts to go green!
The funds will be used on a three tiered basis. The first use will go toward the printing, folding and mounting of sample maps like the one below.

The second tier use will allow us to attend the National Ski Areas Association trade show in early May where we will present the concept to ski resort owners and general managers. The final tier funds will go for the purpose of offseting the cost of tooling and producing multi-cavity injection molds for the housing unit to replace our current single-cavity mold, which would include specialized insert plates to create resort-specific logos for the face of the housing.

Using the latest high tech materials, NaviSki is our decidedly low tech solution to the problems of both paper waste (more on that below) and the inconvenience of the current road-map style of ski map now in use. It's not a sexy new app, but we think it's kinda cool, super convenient and so easy on the environment! With the exception of the elastic band, every element of Naviski is made of recyclable plastic. Even the ""paper"" is environmentally friendly produced plastic; and you can read more about that further down as well.
Okay, so we've had some fun demonstrating the convenience of NaviSki in the video, and while we think this is a pretty deft solution to all of our clumsy map problems, we also have our eye on a far bigger and more important issue.
That large, folded-up paper trail map that the resort ever so kindly gave you when you purchased your lift ticket comes with a serious environmental price. Not their fault. It was what it was. But consider the numbers for a minute. Each one of those maps is roughly the size of four, 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper. With over 300 ski resorts in the United States hosting around 16 million skiers and snow boarders who purchase over 60 million lift tickets, that's a lot of paper, not to mention ink, which, at the end of the day, ends up in the garbage... which ends up in landfills, or sometimes, the maps wind up flying around the mountain as twirling trash twisting in the wind. So just how much paper is that? With upwards of 10 million maps printed up each year and with paper being 0.004 inches in thickness, that amounts to quite a hill of beans. Sorry not a hill... but a mountain. In fact, it's pretty close to a stack of paper over thirteen thousand, two hundred feet tall. So if you were standing on the peak of East Wall at Arapahoe Basin Ski Resort, at thirteen thousand fifty feet, you would have to look up to see the top of that stack of paper.

The pre-assembled components of NaviSki...

 
Part of the funds will go toward producing a multi-rack perforation die larger than our homemade prototype that you see here, for cutting the maps into their uniquely foldable shape, below.

 

The artwork for the maps is already completed but the printing, perforating and mounting within the housings must be executed as well.
To achieve the best possible cost effectiveness, minimum order quantities from the manufacturer are necessary to secure the lowest available per unit price. That low cost will be passed along to the resort in order to remain competitive with the current conventional maps. It's important to remember that because of its reusability, the number of NaviSkis in use at a resort will be far smaller than the quantity of paper maps needed to service the same number of skiers. And that will reduce even further, the resort's expenditure for their maps. That speaks to their bottom line as well as their desire to be environmentally friendly. All we ask of our fellow skiers and riders is that they drop 'em in a convenient barrel on their way out for reuse the next day.
We want to emphasize here that in order to both lessen our environmental footprint by eliminating unnecessary transportation and fuel consumption and provide as many jobs as we possibly can in the local economy, NaviSki will be made entirely in America.
If we prove successful, we can then embark on an effort to expand the use of NaviSki industry-wide and finally eliminate that mountain of paperwork we outlined above. With your help, that goal can be achieved and we will have done our small part to improve life on this lovely blue planet of ours.
To show our appreciation, your rewards...

OKAY A LITTLE TECHNICAL STUFF:
For the ""paper"" maps we use a 100% tree and pulp-free synthetic paper, which results in conservation of forests, water and natural resources.

No ozone-threatening emissions result from the synthetic paper's manufacturing process.
The manufacturing facility in Chesapeake, Virginia has been recognized for excellence in the handling and discharge of waste water.
Crafted of tree-free polypropylene pellets, the ""paper"" is 100% recyclable.
Using the recommended methods, the recycling of the synthetic paper generates no sulfur, nitrogen or dioxin gases.
Internal processes are continually reviewed at every stage to maximize environmental stewardship and minimize our carbon footprint.
Very little water is used in the creation of the paper, which results in the preservation of Earth's water resources.
The paper's durability and attributes yield a map that will have extremely long wear and stay out of the waste stream longer.
Trim created during the manufacturing process is recycled and reintroduced in the production of further maps.
The pulp-free, tree-free synthetic paper is free of toxins and heavy metals, producing yet another environmental benefit.
There you have it. Thank you for taking the time to give us a look-see. Here's hoping that together, we can prove the feasibility of replacing paper maps with recycled plastic to help conserve our resources... one NaviSki at a time!

Short Summary Faucet Handle Safety Restraints is a""Faucetlock"" that guards against small children and aging seniors with special needs from accessing water from bathroom faucets and accidentally scalding themselves and can prevent them accessing water by some  bathtub faucets (depending on the style handle).About Us: 
My name is Larry Holmes, a father of 2 young boys and a Senior Product Designer with over fifteen  years of solid expertise in developing safe, innovative, and consumer items. There are no safety items that prevent small children from accessing water in home bathrooms.  65% of scald burns happen to young children are due to exposure to tap water from sinks and tubs in our homes. Since starting the development of the safety restraints I am constantly connecting with parents, care-givers, pre-K educators and doctors that share with me encounters that they too have had with their juveniles and water burns. 

  How It All Began...      When my son was almost 3 I left him to put 
something in our kitchen for literally less than 2 minutes when I heard 
the sound of running water.  As I ran to the room I found that my 
son had entered our bathroom and turned on our bathtub faucet
 and was falling into the tub when I grabbed him. After making sure that he was ok, I couldn't  help but think ""What if I would've arrived a minute or two later?""    That experience and the thought of ""what if..."" has changed me and how I parent forever!  I learned that day that an accident can happen when we least expect.  
Caring for our aging loved ones...
                 In my later years, my wife and I became tasked with taking care of an aging love one.  This loved one of ours shared with us how one day she had been off her meds which caused crazy side effects.  Waking up one night and feeling confused she went to the bathroom to splash water in her face with hopes of getting her composure back.  While resting her hands in the sink she accidentally turned on the hot water instead of the cold, burning it severally with almost 2nd degree burns.  Thankfully, her neighbor was home to take her to the emergency room for care.  Little did I know that years later that talk would become part of my inspiration behind the Faucet Handle Safety Restraint.    With those two experiences in mind, I set out to do whatever I can to help prevent other families from having occurrences like what I had experienced.  Since that time I’ve heard similar accounts from other parents and care-givers which has fueled me and my wife to continue on this mission to educate care-givers about safe-guarding their homes and thus helping to prevent these occurrences....and the ""FaucetLock"" Faucet Handle Safety Restraint systems were born.Scalds,  account for 33%--58% of all patients hospitalized for burns in the United States. Adults aged ≥65 years have a worse prognosis than younger patients after scald burns because of age-related factors and medical conditions.              ""DON'T LET YOUR LOVED ONE BE SCALDED BY HOT WATER!!!""
What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail: 
I need $50,000 to fund the restraints to manufacturing and full part production.  This will allow us to get aluminum or steel tools for Plastic injection molds, additional engineering services, distribution, packaging, UPC coding, pay for marketing, plus....
The restraints are ready for full scale production, but we need your help to reach a minimum volume needed to make production economically viable. 

Aluminum tools will provide precise and quality parts in a mass scale.
Because its about the children, we want to focus on the item and not other gimmicks; and give contributors really good discounts on the restraints.

They are fighting to rebuild their homes, their families, their lives.And according to them what they need the most are... jobs!They need jobs to ""help them help themselves"" to fully recover from the tragedy that they went through. And that is what TACLOB is set on accomplishing.TACLOB is a collective of artists, designers, social workers, and entrepreneurs that have partnered with survivors and businessmen in disaster zones to  establish a social enterprise dedicated in providing immediate jobs for disaster survivors. As a first initiative we will be training survivors to make ""eco-friendly"" and ""disaster resilient"" bags that they themselves appreciate and the rest of the world would want to have.Meet COMPASSION

COMPASSION will endure your lifestyle.But aside from these details... what excites us about COMPASSION is the functionality of it's interior jeans lining/large pocket which can snugly fit a 13"" Macbook or any standard folder. Yes, this bag does not only look good but it is very functional and handy as well... but more importantly, COMPASSION is not just a bag... it's a badge!Get COMPASSION.  Give COURAGE.Yes, when you get a COMPASSION backpack you help in creating immediate  and much needed jobs for Haiyan survivors. But COMPASSION does not stop there...For every COMPASSION bag that you get, we will give a Haiyan child survivor a  specially designed backpack that will  prepare them in case of an emergency like a tsunami, storm surge and tidal waves!Meet COURAGE
COURAGE is a multi-functional survival backpack that will equip young children to float!!!Masterfully designed by a team of bag makers and designers, this backpack utilizes 2 empty two-liter PET bottles strapped to the side of the bag to enable a child to float.Constructed with high-density, water resistant nylon fabric, it is double stitched with military-grade nylon thread to ensure its longevity.  We've also included reflective striping on the front and back that enhances visibility at night, or in times of search and rescue operations.Everyone we've introduced the COURAGE backpack to is very excited about the bag.  Especially the school officials, parents, and child survivors!COURAGE not only gives them a fighting chance in any case of emergency, it also helps address a deep emotional trauma of uncertainty that is still haunting children to this day.Watch the video below to see how this amazing survival backpack works.How Did We Choose our Funding GoalOur goal of $157,500 is based on the amount needed to:-Purchase the optimized combination of industrial sewing equipment -Sign the lease on our reserved facility (in a typhoon/flood resilient area)-Maintain a 6-month overhead budget-Purchase the materials needed and pay a competitive salary to produce 2,500 COMPASSION backpacks for the world and 2,500 COURAGE backpacks for the

THANKS AGAIN!!!!

The Pinky Promise: Eco-Friendly Jewelry with a social causeBeautiful Jewelry - Good Karma

 Thank you for your interest in the start of my new company. To my ""new friends,"" my name is Brooke Hauser. I have always wanted to start a sustainable business that would have a social and environmental impact, while making a fair profit. My inspiration came from my background in art and design and working at a fair-trade wholesale company that worked with at-risk Artisans. My life changed when I went on a four month volunteer trip to Africa where I saw the big impact that a few dollars a day can make to the less fortunate of the world.

But I need your help to make this a reality...
       Please join me and be a part of this exciting venture


3 NEWLY ADDED PERKS!
NEW PERK A: ""Twist and Shout (Girls)""
Pledge $20 or more...


...and you will receive 4 braided bracelets. 3 solid colored bracelets with recycled African metal beads and 1 multicolored bracelet decorated with a traditional Ethiopian metal trade bead.

NEW PERK B: ""Twist and Shout (Guys)""
Pledge $25 or more...

...and you will receive 3 braided bracelets. 1 wide, 1 with a metal bar bead and 1 with a recycled African glass bead. Color choices:wide braided bracelet: black/olive, navy/olive or red/olivebraided bracelet with metal bar: black, navy, red, or olivebraided bracelet with recycled glass: black/olive, navy/olive or red/olive
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW PERK C: ""A Bit Of Everything""
Pledge $95 or more...


...and you will receive a lavish necklace from Mali, decorated with beautiful traditional glass trading beads, cowrie shells and metal African adornments. Braided leather cord with loop closure. Guaranteed to get a second look from the hip, stylish crowd.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My campaign goal is $8,000. It is expensive to start a new company. The money that I am raising will help cover the set-up costs, both locally and in Mali, promotion, design, product development and the initial inventory. As a huge THANK YOU for your pledges, you will receive my new, stylish, eco-hip jewelry produced by a wonderful at-risk women's group in the African nation of Mali.

Tired of the same old ""factory made"" jewelry from China?  I am!
So get ready for my initial line of vibrant, eco-hip jewelry made from recycled materials and unique African beads.
After Indiegogo - The good karma and The Pinky Promise continues...
This is the start of something big! After the completion of this campaign, I will have a sustainable company with a distribution network from Mali. I will add local team members and start selling online and wholesale to retail stores. I will continue to add new, exciting product lines. Where do we go next? Stay tuned. I will continue to work with talented, at-risk Artisans and as my business grows, so will social impact. Wow, am I excited!
The design and product evolution- not Made in China 
I was tired of the generic designs coming out of factory shops in China. I wanted to provide modern, vibrant jewelry that not only looks great, but also has a positive social impact. GOOD KARMA...Pass it on. While in Africa, I saw firsthand what beautiful creations can come from recycled and other materials. 
When USAID introduced me to this women's group that was creating jewelry from colorful recycled flip-flops, recycled plastic bags and African beads, the light bulb switched on. Eureka!!! 

My art experience at Arizona State University required me to create jewelry and art from recycled materials. This inspired my first line. The Malian women originally sent me recycled flip-flops that were melted down then molded into vibrant, round strings. I also received samples of recycled plastic bag colors and unique African beads. It was fun designing with different color combinations and accents.
What is The Pinky Promise?

My promise is to offer products that fit within my mission and business model of supplying unique, handmade products produced by at-risk individuals. With every business decision I make, the social and environmental impact will be considered - including a fair and sustainable wage for the producers.

I am also fortunate to have a close network of businesses and design mentors that assist me at a reasonable fee, or even free (thanks Mom and Dad!). If I do not reach the $8,000+ goal, you will still get 100% of your perks and I will reevaluate my growth plan.

You can make The Pinky Promise a reality!
Please consider making a pledge and spread the word to your friends and family by email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.

Statistically, the first three days of the campaign are crucial to gain momentum and to have a successful project. THEREFORE, PLEASE PLEDGE EARLY.


To quote Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story:         Together let’s take The Pinky Promise “to infinity and beyond!”

FREE ADDITIONAL GIFTS FOR MY FUNDERS
If you post my project on your Facebook or Twitter, etc. and send 10 personal referral emails - to thank you, I will send you a FREE Recycled Rubber Ring and Recycled Rubber Bracelet with your order. To receive the free gifts, just write, I gave The Pinky Promise a Shout Out on the email that will be sent to you at the end of the project and I will add the extra free gifts to your order.

My Heartfelt Thanks - I couldn’t have done it without you! 


To all my great funders- Thank you for believing
To Indiegogo for offering this awesome platform – Keep it up
To all my great friends who gave me advice and encouragement - you rock!

To Bob and Julie for your insightful business and design advice


Finally, a gigantic Thank You and shout out to my awesome photographer Jessica, my Papa, my gorgeous models and friends Dana, Missy, Laura, Julie, Ali, Erik, Ben, Evangely, Kareen, Irit and their adorable children. Finally, to Mom and Dad who have helped me every step of the way (your check is in the mail).
YOU ALL HELPED MAKE THIS A REALITY!





Pick Your Colors
You will choose your colors once the campaign is over. I will send you an email at the end of the campaign, where you will verify your shipping address and choose your colors. The recycled rubber bracelets are packaged in groups of five. For example, if you purchase 20 bracelets, then you can choose up to four different color groups. For the recycled plastic bag bracelets, please choose one of the color groups below.


*Please Note: Recycled Rubber Multi-Strand Statement Necklace, Recycled Rubber Dangle Earrings and Mali Wedding Glass Bead Necklace and Earrings are multi-colored, similar to the photos. The free Recycled Rubber Rings are also multi-colored, and sizes will vary. Since these products are all handmade with recycled materials, the color and sizes may vary slightly.








FAQ's

When do I choose my colors?I will send you an email at the end of the project time period requesting your color choice(s).


Will the colors and designs exactly match the pictures?Since these are all hand-made from recycled materials and by different Artisans, the color and design of the individual bracelets will vary. I will do my best to send you the closest match possible.


Is it possible to order different sized bracelets?The bracelet sizes will vary slightly and are designed to ""float"" on you wrist for a comfortable fit and fashionable look. Because they are flexible, they will fit most wrists.  I will send you an email at the end of the project time period where you can indicate your preferred size range of S/M or M/L.  The men's bracelets will only come in one size.


Are your earring hooks hypoallergenic?Yes. I personally attached the hooks in San Diego, CA with sensitive ears in mind. I want everyone to be able to enjoy my products!


What is the quality control of the products?When we receive the products, we wash them and check the size and workmanship.
Can you pledge more than one perk?Yes, you can...more good karma! However, you can only pledge one perk per transaction.",28.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> p29:18 is a collection of outerwear for fashion-forward, driven, social butterflies who just happen to be plus size.  p29:18 is built on a commitment to fashion and respect of the consumer and community.</p>
<p>New designers have a catch 22 to overcome. Buyers from boutiques and department stores don't want  to invest in companies who don't have a proven track record. In short, you can't sell to them unless you have sold to someone else.  p29:18 wants to prove that this market is hungry for new designers and great design. Purchasing a coat through  our Indiegogo campaign will help p29:18 take our coats off the internet and bring them to local boutiques in your city</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Starting a clothing line requires a lot of upfront cost. Traditional banks want to see a track record of sales before I can get funding to purchase fabric and get  the coats sewn in a factory. I need women sizes 14-24 to by this collection! </p>
<p>If I presell 25 coats, I can make a deposit to order fabric. </p>
<p>If I presell sell 50 coats, I can pay for my minimum order of fabric ( 1,000 yards!)</p>
<p>If I presell sell 75 coats, I can pay to have the coats sewn at our factory in Washington State, USA.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Young professional plus-sized women are no longer accepting the small, matronly selections offered by popular department stores, and more turbulent seasonal weather is driving the demand for good outerwear. p29:18 is looking to fill this hole in the market; by pre-ordering a coat, you are communicating to the buyers, stylist, editors, and boutique owners that you want beautiful plus-size clothing in your city.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>p29:18 coats will be manufactured in the US based on orders received. The challenge of this philosophy is that, with no backstock on hand, there will be some wait time, after your purchase. A fully funded campaign will be shipped sooner than if we don't meet our goal, BUT IF YOU A BUY A COAT YOU WILL RECEIVE A COAT OR BE FULLY REFUNDED.</p>

The final result is a heavy-duty, colorful pin that will feel like jewerly.
All pins will include flat-head clutches which ensure better comfort, durability, and support compared to butterfly and rubber backings.
Each pin is signed and dated (but not numbered) on the back.
Factory PhotosPins are ready! We're waiting for the final payment to clear. Estimated distribution will be mid-September.There's a shirt!?Yes!

<p>Our vision</p>
<p><strong>«To create a new breed of watch to match our perception of architectural design and functionality. Manufactured in Switzerland at an un-Swiss price»</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>It's bold, it's a Bólido.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Having received the Red Dot Award 2018, the new BÓLIDO X now takes the concept to the next level.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The stainless-steel case incorporates a turning bezel with a diamond-cut side-knurling and additional attractive functionality. What looks competently sleek, requires a radically new technical construction, the complication being hidden on the inside. </strong></p>

<h3><strong>Bólido X Log</strong></h3>
<p>Only few watch brands have defied the challenges of incorporating a slide-ruler disk to their timepieces. To achieve accurate performance, this demands a particularly high level of mechanical precision in the case-making.</p>

<p>Being ""always at hand"", a slide-rulers on your wrist is very useful for quick conversions of currencies when travelling, lengths, speeds and distances, weights, temperatures etc. on the fly. The new Bólido X Log enables quick easy divisions, multiplications and «rule of three»- calculations. Aside of this and its performance as a Swiss automatic mechanical timekeeper, the Bólido X Log is also simply a stunning eye-catcher.</p>

Alternatively available at an additional cost of just 30 CHF to be added to your pledge, we offer a luxurious genuine ostrich-leather strap SAVANNA or a fashionable, fully adjustable MILANO wire-mesh bracelet; the MILANO is either steel coloured or black PVD coated to match the case colour.  Choose the preferred band-model on the survey that you'll receive after the campaign is completed.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Bólido rocks because it ticks</strong></h3>
<p>True longevity of watches is measured in generations, not in sequences of yearly updates.  Bólido timepieces are strictly mechanical and can be serviced and repaired during a lifetime and beyond; they will never become obsolete just because a certain battery type is no longer produced. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Only a watch made in Switzerland is SWISS MADE</strong></h3>
<p>Savvy backers are not fooled by intentionally misleading euphemisms like “Swiss parts”, “Swiss design”, “Swiss company”, etc.  A truly “Swiss made” must comply with stiff regulations defined by the Swiss government in conjunction with the federation of the watch-making industry. They are manufactured in the birth land of watchmaking, where it is subjected to high statutory standards. Where an apprentice undergoes four years of basic professional training to learn the practical and the intellectual skills and to pass a demanding governmental examination, before being permitted to using the title of a Swiss watchmaker. And this of course is only the start, as freshmen will continue to enhance their skills to further their careers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>COSC chronometer certification</strong></h3>
<p>The one way to further enhance a product that already has received the best technical and artisanal attention of highly competent professionals would be an official and neutral certification of <a href=""https://www.cosc.swiss/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">COSC Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584018738/ptjks4qkukvt2ibfbwzt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This coveted certification is awarded to an individually numbered movement after it has successfully passed an independent, 14-day inspection-sequence of precision and reliability in high and low temperatures as well as in 5 different positions. (It helps that all Bólido movements are factory-tested in the same 5 positions by default).</p>
<p>A C.O.S.C. certification is the highest quality rating a Swiss timepiece can obtain, the prestigious “Certified Swiss Chronometer C.O.S.C.” badge printed on the dial is seen on only 6 % of Switzerland’s total watch production. Backers can pledge for the chronometer-option at additional cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>A mechanical watch is as good as its service</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584019044/ixmpd7gj6d3qyxy4mcbe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We take care of your timepiece, be it within the international 2-year warranty and beyond. Designated Bólido service centers are located in Switzerland, Germany (for the EU), the USA and Japan and are expanded to more countries as we grow.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>A Bólido keeps its value</strong></h3>
<p>Anyone knowledgable about watches will wonder how it is possible that a timepiece such as the Bólido X costs only a fraction of absolutely comparable models of established brands with the same specs; and we are talking of our forthcoming regular shop prices! The additional discounts of our limited crowdfunding rewards are flat-out incredible, but you must take advantage quickly, as this opportunity will not come back. In all probability, the Bólido X, –notably from a company with a proven track-record of two successful previous campaigns–, will be our last project to be financed by crowd-funding at such exceptional conditions. To afford the advertising necessary to grow, we will no longer be able to give away the heavy crowdfunding discounts.  Price increases are to be expected; you'll never get a genuine Bólido at these outstanding offers again. </p>

<p>Unsere Vision:</p>
<p><strong>«Mit archetypischem Design Authentizität schaffen. Schweizer Manufaktur zu un-schweizerischen Preisen»</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sie ist kühn, es ist eine Bólido.</strong></p>
<p>Nach der Auszeichnung mit dem Red Dot Award 2018 führt die neue BÓLIDO X das Konzept nun auf die nächste Stufe.</p>
<p>Das Gehäuse aus Edelstahl verfügt über eine Drehlünette mit einer seitlichen, diamantgeschliffenen Rändelung und zusätzlicher attraktiver Funktionalität. Was einfach und schlicht aussieht, erfordert eine radikal neue technische Konstruktion, deren Komplikation jedoch im Inneren verborgen bleibt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bólido X LOG</strong></p>
<p>Nur wenige Uhren Marken haben sich der Herausforderung gestellt, eine Rechenscheibe in ihre Zeitmesser einzubauen. Dies erfordert eine besonders hohe mechanische Fertigungs- und Druck-Präzision. Eine in die Uhr eingebaute Rechenscheibe ist unterwegs «stets zur Hand» und sehr nützlich für die rasche Konvertierung von Währungs-, Längen-, Geschwindigkeits-, Distanz-, Gewichts- und Temperatur-Einheiten. Die aussergewöhnliche BÓLIDO X LOG ermöglicht auch Divisionen, Multiplikationen und Dreisatz-Rechnungen. Dazu besticht der neue mechanische Schweizer Zeitmesser mit seinem atemberaubend modernen Design.</p>

</div></div></div></div></div>
<p><strong>Bólido X CD</strong></p>
<p>Die gleiche Drehlünette ist auch in die Bólido X CD eingebaut und zeigt auf graphische Weise an, welche Restzeit einer vorher eingestellten Dauer bleibt, denken Sie an Parkuhr, Meetings, Tauchen usw. Das Ganze funktioniert auf denkbar einfache Weise: Stellen Sie die gewünschte Zeitdauer auf der Lünette auf die Position des Minuten-zeigers; der Pfeil zeigt nun das Ende des Countdowns an; die letzten 15 Minuten (bei Segelregatten die wichtigsten!) sind farblich hervorgehoben.</p>
<p>Mit ihrer Drehlünette und der breiten Palette häufig verwendeter Funktionen sind beide Bólido X Modelle im Vergleich zur klassischen Bólido auch etwas grösser. (s. Daten)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Eine Auswahl an attraktiven Bändern</strong></p>
<p>Die vier Bólido X-Modelle sind standardmässig mit einem maßgefertigten und lang-lebigen Band aus Kautschuk ausgestattet; dieses hält ""ewig"" und lässt sich unter dem Wasserhahn reinigen. Wir sind der Meinung, dass es perfekt zum modernen, sportlichen Design der Uhren passt. Alternativ bieten wir Ihnen gegen einen kleinen Aufpreis von nur 30 CHF das luxuriöse SAVANNA Band aus echtem Straussenleder oder ein modisches, voll einstellbares MILANO-Drahtgeflecht-Stahlband an, welches wahlweise natürlich auch mit schwarzer PVD-Beschichtung passend zur Gehäusefarbe geliefert wird. Nach Abschluss der Kampagne erhalten Sie einen Fragebogen zugestellt, in welchem Sie das bevorzugte Bandmodel bestimmen können.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Die Bólido rockt, weil sie tickt</strong></p>
<p>Die wahre Langlebigkeit von Uhren wird in Generationen gemessen, nicht in Sequenzen von jährlichen Updates. Die Mechanik aller Bólido-Uhren kann ein Leben lang – und darüber hinaus – gewartet und repariert werden; mit ihrem zeitlosen Design werden sie auch nicht veraltet sein, nur weil ein bestimmter Batterietyp nicht mehr hergestellt wird.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584026007/cal0lsejypdwcmmycqev.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nur eine in der Schweiz hergestellte Uhr ist SWISS MADE</strong></p>
<p>Uhren-Kenner lassen sich nicht von irreführenden Euphemismen wie «Swiss Parts"", ""Schweizer Design"", ""Schweizer Hersteller"" usw. täuschen; nur die gesetzlich geschützte Bezeichnung ""Swiss made"" auf dem Zifferblatt gewährleistet, dass die Uhr die strengen Vorschriften erfüllt, die von der Schweizer Regierung in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Verband der Uhrenindustrie festgelegt wurden. Nur dann wurde sie im Geburtsland der Uhrmacherei hergestellt, wo sie hohen gesetzlichen Mindest-Standards unterworfen ist. Wo ein Uhrmacher eine vierjährige berufliche Grund-ausbildung und eine anspruchsvolle staatliche Abschluss-Prüfung bestehen muss, bevor er den Berufstitel tragen darf. Und die weiteren Karriere-Schritte bedingen eine ständige Weiterbildung.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COSC-Chronometer-Zertifizierung</strong></p>
<p>Die einzige Möglichkeit, den Nimbus einer Schweizer Uhr zu steigern, ist deren offizielle Zertifizierung durch die unabhängige <a href=""https://www.cosc.swiss/de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">COSC Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres</a>.</p>
<p>Diese exklusive Zertifizierung wird an ein einzeln nummeriertes Uhrwerk vergeben, nachdem es eine 14-tägige Prüfsequenz von Präzision und Zuverlässigkeit bei hohen und tiefen Temperaturen sowie in 5 verschiedenen Positionen erfolgreich durchlaufen hat. (Es hilft, dass alle Bólido-Werke bereits werksseitig in den gleichen 5 Positionen getestet werden).</p>
<p>Eine C.O.S.C.-Zertifizierung ist die höchste Auszeichnung für einen Schweizer Zeitmesser. Die auf dem Zifferblatt aufgedruckte, prestigeträchtige Bezeichnung “Certified Swiss Chronometer C.O.S.C.” findet sich nur auf ca. 6 % aller Schweizer Uhren.</p>
<p>In dieser Kampagne haben Sie die exklusive Möglichkeit, sich Ihre Bólido gegen Aufpreis als zertifizierten Chronometer zu bestellen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Eine mechanische Uhr ist so gut wie ihr Service</strong></p>
<p>Wir kümmern uns um Ihre Bólido. Ausgewiesene Bólido-Servicezentren befinden sich in der Schweiz, in Deutschland (für die EU), in den USA und in Japan und werden im Zuge unserer Marktentwicklung auf weitere Länder ausgedehnt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Eine Bólido behält ihren Wert</strong></p>
<p>Jeder, der sich mit Uhren auskennt, wird sich fragen, wie es möglich ist, dass ein Zeitmesser wie die Bólido X nur einen Bruchteil vergleichbarer Modelle etablierter Marken mit den gleichen Spezifikationen kostet; und wir sprechen hier von unseren zukünftigen regulären Ladenpreisen! Die zusätzlichen Preisnachlässe unserer limitierten Kickstarter-Prämien sind umso unglaublicher, aber Sie müssen sich schnell entscheiden, denn diese Gelegenheit wird sich nicht mehr bieten.</p>
<p>Aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach wird die Bólido X unser letztes Crowdfunding Projekt sein, dessen Realisierung mit solch außergewöhnlichen Bedingungen finanziert wird. Um uns die für das weitere Wachstum notwendige Werbung leisten zu können, werden wir nicht mehr in der Lage sein, die hohen Preisnachlässe aus dem Crowdfunding zu verschenken; Preiserhöhungen sind zu erwarten. Deshalb werden Sie nie wieder eine Bólido zu derart sensationellen Preisen bekommen.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584028349/evfypl3zoyscgbi0z03s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Wozu dient der Ertrag aus diesem Crowdfunding ?</strong></p>
<p>Wir haben die gesamten Kosten für Design, Forschung und Entwicklung und die Vorbereitung von (funktionierenden!) Prototypen selbst finanziert. Um dieses Projekt nun zu realisieren, sind neue Werkzeuge und die Vorfinanzierung beträchtlicher Mindest-Bestellmengen (MOQ) erforderlich. Erst Ihre Investition in diese Kampagne ermöglicht die Realisierung dieses ehrgeizigen Projekts. Deshalb wollen wir Sie im Gegenzug mit den am schärfsten je gerechneten Preisen belohnen.</p>
<p>Nur mit Ihrer Hilfe werden diese wunderschönen Zeitmesser Wirklichkeit werden. </p>
<p>Wir danken Ihnen allen.</p>

<p>Notre vision :</p>
<p><strong>«Créer l'authenticité avec un design archétypal. Manufacture suisse à des prix non suisses» </strong></p>
<p><strong>Elle est audacieuse, c'est une Bólido.</strong></p>
<p>Ayant reçu le Red Dot Award 2018, la nouvelle BÓLIDO X fait passer le concept à un niveau supérieur.</p>
<p>Le boîtier en acier inox intègre une lunette tournante avec un moletage latéral taillé en diamant et des fonctionnalités supplémentaires attrayantes. Ce qui paraît simple et épuré, nécessite une construction technique radicalement nouvelle, la complication étant cachée à l'intérieur. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bólido X Log</strong></p>
<p>Peu de marques de montres sont parvenus à relever le défi d'incorporer des disques de règle à calcul à leurs garde-temps. Pour obtenir des performances correctes, cela exige un niveau de précision mécanique particulièrement élevé dans la fabrication des boîtiers.</p>
<p>Étant ""toujours à portée de main"", une règle à calcul à votre poignet est très utile pour convertir rapidement les devises lors de vos déplacements, les longueurs, les vitesses et les distances, les poids, les températures, etc. à la volée. La nouvelle Bólido X Log permet de faire des divisions, des multiplications et des calculs rapides. Outre ses performances en tant que chronométreur mécanique automatique suisse, la Bólido Log est tout simplement un étonnant accroche-regard.</p>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/391012036?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Bólido X CD</strong></p>
<p>La Bólido X CD a la même construction de lunette tournante, mais elle indique graphiquement un temps restant, pensez au parcmètre, aux réunions, à la plongée, etc. Simple, pratique et rapide : faites correspondre la position de l'aiguille des minutes avec un temps choisi sur la lunette et la flèche indique la fin du compte à rebours ; les 15 dernières minutes (dans les régates de voile, les plus importantes) sont mises en évidence en couleur.</p>
<p>Les nouveaux modèles Bólido X sont des instruments pour un large éventail de tâches souvent utilisées. Sa taille globale légèrement augmentée plaira aux supporters aux poignets masculins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Un choix de bracelets attrayantes</strong></p>
<p>Les quatre modèles Bólido X sont d’office équipés d'un véritable bracelet en Caoutchouc, fabriqué sur mesure et durable ""à jamais"", il peut être nettoyé en le tenant sous un robinet d'eau ; nous pensons qu'il s'adapte parfaitement au design moderne et sportif des montres. Cependant, vous pouvez également choisir, pour un coût supplémentaire de 30 CHF seulement à ajouter à votre engagement, un luxueux bracelet en cuir d'autruche véritable SAVANNA ou un bracelet en acier à mailles métalliques MILANO à la mode et entièrement réglable ; la MILANO est soit de couleur acier, soit revêtue de PVD noir pour s'harmoniser avec la couleur du boîtier.  Choisissez le modèle de bracelet préféré sur le questionnaire que vous recevrez une fois la campagne terminée.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>La Bólido vibre parce qu'elle fait tic-tac</strong></p>
<p>La véritable longévité des montres est mesurée en générations, et non en séquences des updates annuelles.  Les montres Bólido sont strictement mécaniques et peuvent être entretenues et réparées tout au long d’une vie entière et au-delà ; elles ne deviendront pas obsolètes simplement parce qu'un certain type de pile n'est plus produit.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584026097/ccvy94veuk8nvsxoqza2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Seule une montre fabriquée en Suisse est SWISS MADE</strong></p>
<p>Les connaisseurs avertis ne sont pas dupes d'euphémismes intentionnellement trompeurs comme ""Swiss Parts"", ""design suisse"", ""entreprise suisse"", etc.  Un véritable ""SWISS MADE"" doit se conformer à des règles strictes définies par le gouvernement suisse en collaboration avec la fédération de l'industrie horlogère. Elles sont fabriquées dans le berceau de l'horlogerie, où elles sont soumises à des normes légales élevées. Où un apprenti suit une formation professionnelle de base de quatre ans pour acquérir les compétences pratiques et intellectuelles et passer un examen gouvernemental exigeant, avant d'être autorisé à utiliser le titre d'horloger suisse. Et ce n'est bien sûr qu'un début, car  les étapes suivantes de la carrière nécessitent une formation continuelle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Certification de chronomètre COSC</strong></p>
<p>La seule façon de valoriser davantage un produit qui a déjà reçu la meilleure attention technique et artisanale de professionnels hautement compétents serait une certification officielle et neutre du <a href=""https://www.cosc.swiss"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">COSC Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres</a></p>
<p>Cette certification très convoitée est attribuée à un mouvement numéroté individuellement après qu'il ait passé avec succès une séquence d'inspection de 14 jours de précision et de fiabilité à haute et basse température ainsi que dans 5 positions différentes. (Il est utile que tous les mouvements Bólido soient testés en usine dans les mêmes 5 positions par défaut).</p>
<p>La certification C.O.S.C. est le plus haut niveau de qualité qu'un garde-temps suisse puisse obtenir. Le prestigieux badge “Certified Swiss Chronometer C.O.S.C.” imprimé sur le cadran apparaît sur seulement 6 % de la production horlogère totale de la Suisse. Les bailleurs de fonds peuvent s'engager pour l'option chronomètre moyennant un coût supplémentaire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Une montre mécanique est aussi bonne que son service</strong></p>
<p>Nous prenons soin de votre montre. Les centres de service Bólido sont situés en Suisse, en Allemagne (pour l'UE), aux États-Unis et au Japon et s'étendent à d'autres pays au fur et à mesure de notre croissance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Une Bólido garde sa valeur</strong></p>
<p>Quiconque s'y connaît en horlogerie se demandera comment il est possible qu'un garde-temps comme le Bólido X ne coûte qu'une fraction des modèles comparables de marques établies ayant les mêmes caractéristiques ; et nous parlons ici de nos prochains prix réguliers en magasin ! Les réductions supplémentaires de nos récompenses Kickstarter limitées sont tout simplement incroyables, mais vous devez en profiter rapidement, car cette opportunité ne se représentera plus. Selon toute probabilité, le Bólido X, notamment de la part d'une société qui a fait ses preuves lors de deux campagnes précédentes, sera notre dernier projet financé par le public à des conditions aussi exceptionnelles. Pour nous permettre d'assurer la publicité nécessaire à notre croissance, nous ne pourrons plus accorder les lourdes remises liées au financement par le public et il faut s'attendre à des hausses de prix. Vous n'aurez plus jamais de Bólido à ces offres exceptionnelles.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584028401/qz7qfm8yoiyane3cvlig.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>À quoi sert cette collecte de fonds ?</strong></p>
<p>Nous avons financé nous-mêmes la totalité des coûts de conception, de R&amp;D et de préparation des prototypes de travail à l'échelle 1:1. Pour réaliser ce projet, il faut maintenant de nouveaux outillages et des avances pour des quantités initiales minimales de commande (MOQ) considérables. Vos nombreuses promesses de dons rendent tout cela possible. En retour, nous rendons nos récompenses aussi attrayantes que possible.  Ensemble, faisons de ces beaux garde-temps une réalité ! Merci à tous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Les médias s'enthousiasment pour Bólido</strong></p>
<p>Il ne s'agit que d'une sélection de la couverture médiatique (non rémunérée !) de Bólido, ""un luminaire qui croise les vedettes fixes quelque peu immobiles des marques établies sur le firmament horloger"".</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risques et défis</strong></p>
<p>L'équipe de Bólido est composée de professionnels expérimentés de l'horlogerie, qui connaissent les rouages du développement, de la production, du contrôle qualité et de la logistique des montres. Toutes nos sources et tous nos fournisseurs sont des entreprises réputées et éprouvées. Ceci, combiné à notre expérience en matière de crowdfunding de deux campagnes réussies dans le passé, constitue une base solide pour une exécution ordonnée de ce projet.</p>
<p>Néanmoins, nous sommes bien conscients que chaque projet comporte ses propres risques et défis. Il est inévitable que des difficultés surviennent au cours du processus et l'expérience nous aide à les surmonter. Si nous devions rencontrer un problème important susceptible d'affecter nos performances, nous nous engageons à vous en informer immédiatement.           </p>
<p> Il est évident que le plus grand risque (pour nous) est de ne pas obtenir le finance-ment de ce projet; si tel est le cas, vous n'aurez aucun frais à payer et votre carte ne sera pas débitée. Cependant, dès que nous aurons atteint notre objectif de financement de cette campagne, nous et nos fournisseurs serons prêts à commencer la production.</p>

«To create a new breed of watch to match our perception of architectural design and functionality. Manufactured in Switzerland at an un-Swiss price»
 
It's bold, it's a Bólido.
Having received the Red Dot Award 2018, the new BÓLIDO X now takes the concept to the next level.
The stainless-steel case incorporates a turning bezel with a diamond-cut side-knurling and additional attractive functionality. What looks competently sleek, requires a radically new technical construction, the complication being hidden on the inside.

Bólido X Log
Only few watch brands have defied the challenges of incorporating a slide-ruler disk to their timepieces. To achieve accurate performance, this demands a particularly high level of mechanical precision in the case-making.

Being ""always at hand"", a slide-rulers on your wrist is very useful for quick conversions of currencies when travelling, lengths, speeds and distances, weights, temperatures etc. on the fly. The new Bólido X Log enables quick easy divisions, multiplications and «rule of three»- calculations. Aside of this and its performance as a Swiss automatic mechanical timekeeper, the Bólido X Log is also simply a stunning eye-catcher.
 
Bólido X CD

The Bólido X CD has the same turning bezel construction, but it graphically indicates a remaining time, think of parking meter, meetings, diving etc. Simple, practical and quick: Match the position of the minute hand with a chosen amount of time on the bezel and the arrow indicates the end of the countdown; the last 15 minutes (in sailing regattas the most important-) are highlighted in color.

The crystal at the back of the BÓLIDO X is dome-shaped to give a loupe view of the movement, Also note the Quick-release spring bars that allow easy change of bands
 
 
A choice of attractive bands
The four Bólido X models come with a genuine, custom-made and durable Caoutchouc strap lasting ""forever"", it can be cleaned by holding it under a water tap; we think that it fits the modern, sporty design of the watches perfectly. Alternatively available at an additional cost of just 30 CHF to be added to your pledge, we offer a luxurious genuine ostrich-leather strap SAVANNA or a fashionable, fully adjustable MILANO wire-mesh bracelet; the MILANO is either steel coloured or black PVD coated to match the case colour.  Choose the preferred band-model on the survey that you'll receive after the campaign is completed.

Optional: SAVANNA ostrich leather (left), MILANO wire mesh steel and black (right)
 
 

 
 
Bólido rocks because it ticks
True longevity of watches is measured in generations, not in sequences of yearly updates.  Bólido timepieces are strictly mechanical and can be serviced and repaired during a lifetime and beyond; they will never become obsolete just because a certain battery type is no longer produced. 
 
Only a watch made in Switzerland is SWISS MADE
Savvy backers are not fooled by intentionally misleading euphemisms like “Swiss parts”, “Swiss design”, “Swiss company”, etc.  A truly “Swiss made” must comply with stiff regulations defined by the Swiss government in conjunction with the federation of the watch-making industry. They are manufactured in the birth land of watchmaking, where it is subjected to high statutory standards. Where an apprentice undergoes four years of basic professional training to learn the practical and the intellectual skills and to pass a demanding governmental examination, before being permitted to using the title of a Swiss watchmaker. And this of course is only the start, as freshmen will continue to enhance their skills to further their careers.
 
COSC chronometer certification
The one way to further enhance a product that already has received the best technical and artisanal attention of highly competent professionals would be an official and neutral certification of COSC Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres

This coveted certification is awarded to an individually numbered movement after it has successfully passed an independent, 14-day inspection-sequence of precision and reliability in high and low temperatures as well as in 5 different positions. (It helps that all Bólido movements are factory-tested in the same 5 positions by default).
A C.O.S.C. certification is the highest quality rating a Swiss timepiece can obtain, the prestigious “Certified Swiss Chronometer C.O.S.C.” badge printed on the dial is seen on only 6 % of Switzerland’s total watch production. Backers can pledge for the chronometer-option at additional cost.
 
A mechanical watch is as good as its service
 

 
We take care of your timepiece, be it within the international 2-year warranty and beyond. Designated Bólido service centers are located in Switzerland, Germany (for the EU), the USA and Japan and are expanded to more countries as we grow.
 
A Bólido keeps its value
Anyone knowledgable about watches will wonder how it is possible that a timepiece such as the Bólido X costs only a fraction of absolutely comparable models of established brands with the same specs; and we are talking of our forthcoming regular shop prices! The additional discounts of our limited crowdfunding rewards are flat-out incredible, but you must take advantage quickly, as this opportunity will not come back. In all probability, the Bólido X, –notably from a company with a proven track-record of two successful previous campaigns–, will be our last project to be financed by crowd-funding at such exceptional conditions. To afford the advertising necessary to grow, we will no longer be able to give away the heavy crowdfunding discounts.  Price increases are to be expected; you'll never get a genuine Bólido at these outstanding offers again. 
 

 
 

Bólido X on your wrist, what a statement! (Top: CD, bottom: LOG)
 
 
What is this fund raising for?
We have financed the entire cost for design, R&D and the preparation of 1:1 working prototypes by ourselves. To now realise this project, new tooling and the advance-payments for considerable minimum initial order quantities (MOQ) are required. Your numerous pledges are making it all possible. In return we make our rewards as attractive as possible.  Let's make these beautiful timepieces a reality together! Thank you all.
 

Close your pledge NOW to secure your package!

Deutsch-Übersetzung der Texte
Unsere Vision:
«Mit archetypischem Design Authentizität schaffen. Schweizer Manufaktur zu un-schweizerischen Preisen»
Sie ist kühn, es ist eine Bólido.
Nach der Auszeichnung mit dem Red Dot Award 2018 führt die neue BÓLIDO X das Konzept nun auf die nächste Stufe.
Das Gehäuse aus Edelstahl verfügt über eine Drehlünette mit einer seitlichen, diamantgeschliffenen Rändelung und zusätzlicher attraktiver Funktionalität. Was einfach und schlicht aussieht, erfordert eine radikal neue technische Konstruktion, deren Komplikation jedoch im Inneren verborgen bleibt.
 
Bólido X LOG
Nur wenige Uhren Marken haben sich der Herausforderung gestellt, eine Rechenscheibe in ihre Zeitmesser einzubauen. Dies erfordert eine besonders hohe mechanische Fertigungs- und Druck-Präzision. Eine in die Uhr eingebaute Rechenscheibe ist unterwegs «stets zur Hand» und sehr nützlich für die rasche Konvertierung von Währungs-, Längen-, Geschwindigkeits-, Distanz-, Gewichts- und Temperatur-Einheiten. Die aussergewöhnliche BÓLIDO X LOG ermöglicht auch Divisionen, Multiplikationen und Dreisatz-Rechnungen. Dazu besticht der neue mechanische Schweizer Zeitmesser mit seinem atemberaubend modernen Design.

 

 

Bólido X CD
Die gleiche Drehlünette ist auch in die Bólido X CD eingebaut und zeigt auf graphische Weise an, welche Restzeit einer vorher eingestellten Dauer bleibt, denken Sie an Parkuhr, Meetings, Tauchen usw. Das Ganze funktioniert auf denkbar einfache Weise: Stellen Sie die gewünschte Zeitdauer auf der Lünette auf die Position des Minuten-zeigers; der Pfeil zeigt nun das Ende des Countdowns an; die letzten 15 Minuten (bei Segelregatten die wichtigsten!) sind farblich hervorgehoben.
Mit ihrer Drehlünette und der breiten Palette häufig verwendeter Funktionen sind beide Bólido X Modelle im Vergleich zur klassischen Bólido auch etwas grösser. (s. Daten)
 
Eine Auswahl an attraktiven Bändern
Die vier Bólido X-Modelle sind standardmässig mit einem maßgefertigten und lang-lebigen Band aus Kautschuk ausgestattet; dieses hält ""ewig"" und lässt sich unter dem Wasserhahn reinigen. Wir sind der Meinung, dass es perfekt zum modernen, sportlichen Design der Uhren passt. Alternativ bieten wir Ihnen gegen einen kleinen Aufpreis von nur 30 CHF das luxuriöse SAVANNA Band aus echtem Straussenleder oder ein modisches, voll einstellbares MILANO-Drahtgeflecht-Stahlband an, welches wahlweise natürlich auch mit schwarzer PVD-Beschichtung passend zur Gehäusefarbe geliefert wird. Nach Abschluss der Kampagne erhalten Sie einen Fragebogen zugestellt, in welchem Sie das bevorzugte Bandmodel bestimmen können.
 
Die Bólido rockt, weil sie tickt
Die wahre Langlebigkeit von Uhren wird in Generationen gemessen, nicht in Sequenzen von jährlichen Updates. Die Mechanik aller Bólido-Uhren kann ein Leben lang – und darüber hinaus – gewartet und repariert werden; mit ihrem zeitlosen Design werden sie auch nicht veraltet sein, nur weil ein bestimmter Batterietyp nicht mehr hergestellt wird.

 
Nur eine in der Schweiz hergestellte Uhr ist SWISS MADE
Uhren-Kenner lassen sich nicht von irreführenden Euphemismen wie «Swiss Parts"", ""Schweizer Design"", ""Schweizer Hersteller"" usw. täuschen; nur die gesetzlich geschützte Bezeichnung ""Swiss made"" auf dem Zifferblatt gewährleistet, dass die Uhr die strengen Vorschriften erfüllt, die von der Schweizer Regierung in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Verband der Uhrenindustrie festgelegt wurden. Nur dann wurde sie im Geburtsland der Uhrmacherei hergestellt, wo sie hohen gesetzlichen Mindest-Standards unterworfen ist. Wo ein Uhrmacher eine vierjährige berufliche Grund-ausbildung und eine anspruchsvolle staatliche Abschluss-Prüfung bestehen muss, bevor er den Berufstitel tragen darf. Und die weiteren Karriere-Schritte bedingen eine ständige Weiterbildung.
 
COSC-Chronometer-Zertifizierung
Die einzige Möglichkeit, den Nimbus einer Schweizer Uhr zu steigern, ist deren offizielle Zertifizierung durch die unabhängige COSC Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres.
Diese exklusive Zertifizierung wird an ein einzeln nummeriertes Uhrwerk vergeben, nachdem es eine 14-tägige Prüfsequenz von Präzision und Zuverlässigkeit bei hohen und tiefen Temperaturen sowie in 5 verschiedenen Positionen erfolgreich durchlaufen hat. (Es hilft, dass alle Bólido-Werke bereits werksseitig in den gleichen 5 Positionen getestet werden).
Eine C.O.S.C.-Zertifizierung ist die höchste Auszeichnung für einen Schweizer Zeitmesser. Die auf dem Zifferblatt aufgedruckte, prestigeträchtige Bezeichnung “Certified Swiss Chronometer C.O.S.C.” findet sich nur auf ca. 6 % aller Schweizer Uhren.
In dieser Kampagne haben Sie die exklusive Möglichkeit, sich Ihre Bólido gegen Aufpreis als zertifizierten Chronometer zu bestellen.
 
Eine mechanische Uhr ist so gut wie ihr Service
Wir kümmern uns um Ihre Bólido. Ausgewiesene Bólido-Servicezentren befinden sich in der Schweiz, in Deutschland (für die EU), in den USA und in Japan und werden im Zuge unserer Marktentwicklung auf weitere Länder ausgedehnt.
 
Eine Bólido behält ihren Wert
Jeder, der sich mit Uhren auskennt, wird sich fragen, wie es möglich ist, dass ein Zeitmesser wie die Bólido X nur einen Bruchteil vergleichbarer Modelle etablierter Marken mit den gleichen Spezifikationen kostet; und wir sprechen hier von unseren zukünftigen regulären Ladenpreisen! Die zusätzlichen Preisnachlässe unserer limitierten Kickstarter-Prämien sind umso unglaublicher, aber Sie müssen sich schnell entscheiden, denn diese Gelegenheit wird sich nicht mehr bieten.
Aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach wird die Bólido X unser letztes Crowdfunding Projekt sein, dessen Realisierung mit solch außergewöhnlichen Bedingungen finanziert wird. Um uns die für das weitere Wachstum notwendige Werbung leisten zu können, werden wir nicht mehr in der Lage sein, die hohen Preisnachlässe aus dem Crowdfunding zu verschenken; Preiserhöhungen sind zu erwarten. Deshalb werden Sie nie wieder eine Bólido zu derart sensationellen Preisen bekommen.
 

 
Wozu dient der Ertrag aus diesem Crowdfunding ?
Wir haben die gesamten Kosten für Design, Forschung und Entwicklung und die Vorbereitung von (funktionierenden!) Prototypen selbst finanziert. Um dieses Projekt nun zu realisieren, sind neue Werkzeuge und die Vorfinanzierung beträchtlicher Mindest-Bestellmengen (MOQ) erforderlich. Erst Ihre Investition in diese Kampagne ermöglicht die Realisierung dieses ehrgeizigen Projekts. Deshalb wollen wir Sie im Gegenzug mit den am schärfsten je gerechneten Preisen belohnen.
Nur mit Ihrer Hilfe werden diese wunderschönen Zeitmesser Wirklichkeit werden. 
Wir danken Ihnen allen.

Traduit en Français
Notre vision :
«Créer l'authenticité avec un design archétypal. Manufacture suisse à des prix non suisses» 
Elle est audacieuse, c'est une Bólido.
Ayant reçu le Red Dot Award 2018, la nouvelle BÓLIDO X fait passer le concept à un niveau supérieur.
Le boîtier en acier inox intègre une lunette tournante avec un moletage latéral taillé en diamant et des fonctionnalités supplémentaires attrayantes. Ce qui paraît simple et épuré, nécessite une construction technique radicalement nouvelle, la complication étant cachée à l'intérieur. 
 
Bólido X Log
Peu de marques de montres sont parvenus à relever le défi d'incorporer des disques de règle à calcul à leurs garde-temps. Pour obtenir des performances correctes, cela exige un niveau de précision mécanique particulièrement élevé dans la fabrication des boîtiers.
Étant ""toujours à portée de main"", une règle à calcul à votre poignet est très utile pour convertir rapidement les devises lors de vos déplacements, les longueurs, les vitesses et les distances, les poids, les températures, etc. à la volée. La nouvelle Bólido X Log permet de faire des divisions, des multiplications et des calculs rapides. Outre ses performances en tant que chronométreur mécanique automatique suisse, la Bólido Log est tout simplement un étonnant accroche-regard.


 

Bólido X CD
La Bólido X CD a la même construction de lunette tournante, mais elle indique graphiquement un temps restant, pensez au parcmètre, aux réunions, à la plongée, etc. Simple, pratique et rapide : faites correspondre la position de l'aiguille des minutes avec un temps choisi sur la lunette et la flèche indique la fin du compte à rebours ; les 15 dernières minutes (dans les régates de voile, les plus importantes) sont mises en évidence en couleur.
Les nouveaux modèles Bólido X sont des instruments pour un large éventail de tâches souvent utilisées. Sa taille globale légèrement augmentée plaira aux supporters aux poignets masculins.
 
Un choix de bracelets attrayantes
Les quatre modèles Bólido X sont d’office équipés d'un véritable bracelet en Caoutchouc, fabriqué sur mesure et durable ""à jamais"", il peut être nettoyé en le tenant sous un robinet d'eau ; nous pensons qu'il s'adapte parfaitement au design moderne et sportif des montres. Cependant, vous pouvez également choisir, pour un coût supplémentaire de 30 CHF seulement à ajouter à votre engagement, un luxueux bracelet en cuir d'autruche véritable SAVANNA ou un bracelet en acier à mailles métalliques MILANO à la mode et entièrement réglable ; la MILANO est soit de couleur acier, soit revêtue de PVD noir pour s'harmoniser avec la couleur du boîtier.  Choisissez le modèle de bracelet préféré sur le questionnaire que vous recevrez une fois la campagne terminée.
 
La Bólido vibre parce qu'elle fait tic-tac
La véritable longévité des montres est mesurée en générations, et non en séquences des updates annuelles.  Les montres Bólido sont strictement mécaniques et peuvent être entretenues et réparées tout au long d’une vie entière et au-delà ; elles ne deviendront pas obsolètes simplement parce qu'un certain type de pile n'est plus produit.

Seule une montre fabriquée en Suisse est SWISS MADE
Les connaisseurs avertis ne sont pas dupes d'euphémismes intentionnellement trompeurs comme ""Swiss Parts"", ""design suisse"", ""entreprise suisse"", etc.  Un véritable ""SWISS MADE"" doit se conformer à des règles strictes définies par le gouvernement suisse en collaboration avec la fédération de l'industrie horlogère. Elles sont fabriquées dans le berceau de l'horlogerie, où elles sont soumises à des normes légales élevées. Où un apprenti suit une formation professionnelle de base de quatre ans pour acquérir les compétences pratiques et intellectuelles et passer un examen gouvernemental exigeant, avant d'être autorisé à utiliser le titre d'horloger suisse. Et ce n'est bien sûr qu'un début, car  les étapes suivantes de la carrière nécessitent une formation continuelle.
 
Certification de chronomètre COSC
La seule façon de valoriser davantage un produit qui a déjà reçu la meilleure attention technique et artisanale de professionnels hautement compétents serait une certification officielle et neutre du COSC Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres
Cette certification très convoitée est attribuée à un mouvement numéroté individuellement après qu'il ait passé avec succès une séquence d'inspection de 14 jours de précision et de fiabilité à haute et basse température ainsi que dans 5 positions différentes. (Il est utile que tous les mouvements Bólido soient testés en usine dans les mêmes 5 positions par défaut).
La certification C.O.S.C. est le plus haut niveau de qualité qu'un garde-temps suisse puisse obtenir. Le prestigieux badge “Certified Swiss Chronometer C.O.S.C.” imprimé sur le cadran apparaît sur seulement 6 % de la production horlogère totale de la Suisse. Les bailleurs de fonds peuvent s'engager pour l'option chronomètre moyennant un coût supplémentaire.
 
Une montre mécanique est aussi bonne que son service
Nous prenons soin de votre montre. Les centres de service Bólido sont situés en Suisse, en Allemagne (pour l'UE), aux États-Unis et au Japon et s'étendent à d'autres pays au fur et à mesure de notre croissance.
 
Une Bólido garde sa valeur
Quiconque s'y connaît en horlogerie se demandera comment il est possible qu'un garde-temps comme le Bólido X ne coûte qu'une fraction des modèles comparables de marques établies ayant les mêmes caractéristiques ; et nous parlons ici de nos prochains prix réguliers en magasin ! Les réductions supplémentaires de nos récompenses Kickstarter limitées sont tout simplement incroyables, mais vous devez en profiter rapidement, car cette opportunité ne se représentera plus. Selon toute probabilité, le Bólido X, notamment de la part d'une société qui a fait ses preuves lors de deux campagnes précédentes, sera notre dernier projet financé par le public à des conditions aussi exceptionnelles. Pour nous permettre d'assurer la publicité nécessaire à notre croissance, nous ne pourrons plus accorder les lourdes remises liées au financement par le public et il faut s'attendre à des hausses de prix. Vous n'aurez plus jamais de Bólido à ces offres exceptionnelles.

 
À quoi sert cette collecte de fonds ?
Nous avons financé nous-mêmes la totalité des coûts de conception, de R&D et de préparation des prototypes de travail à l'échelle 1:1. Pour réaliser ce projet, il faut maintenant de nouveaux outillages et des avances pour des quantités initiales minimales de commande (MOQ) considérables. Vos nombreuses promesses de dons rendent tout cela possible. En retour, nous rendons nos récompenses aussi attrayantes que possible.  Ensemble, faisons de ces beaux garde-temps une réalité ! Merci à tous.
 
Les médias s'enthousiasment pour Bólido
Il ne s'agit que d'une sélection de la couverture médiatique (non rémunérée !) de Bólido, ""un luminaire qui croise les vedettes fixes quelque peu immobiles des marques établies sur le firmament horloger"".
 
Risques et défis
L'équipe de Bólido est composée de professionnels expérimentés de l'horlogerie, qui connaissent les rouages du développement, de la production, du contrôle qualité et de la logistique des montres. Toutes nos sources et tous nos fournisseurs sont des entreprises réputées et éprouvées. Ceci, combiné à notre expérience en matière de crowdfunding de deux campagnes réussies dans le passé, constitue une base solide pour une exécution ordonnée de ce projet.
Néanmoins, nous sommes bien conscients que chaque projet comporte ses propres risques et défis. Il est inévitable que des difficultés surviennent au cours du processus et l'expérience nous aide à les surmonter. Si nous devions rencontrer un problème important susceptible d'affecter nos performances, nous nous engageons à vous en informer immédiatement.           
 Il est évident que le plus grand risque (pour nous) est de ne pas obtenir le finance-ment de ce projet; si tel est le cas, vous n'aurez aucun frais à payer et votre carte ne sera pas débitée. Cependant, dès que nous aurons atteint notre objectif de financement de cette campagne, nous et nos fournisseurs serons prêts à commencer la production.

<h2><b>MADE IN ITALY JUST DESERVES IT!</b></h2>
<p>For 10 years we have been working with SMALL Italian
manufacturing companies … doing what? Just management consulting! Boring
management consulting ;) </p>
<p>We have been in their SMALL factories, we have seen their
potential, we touched the quality characterizing the Italian craftsmanship
world.</p>
<p>We realized how the qualities embedded in artisan thinking and
creation reflect some of today’s society most significant values: attention to
details, ability to adjust, empathy, flexibility, and sustainability.</p>
<p>So now what? </p>
<p>We want to take those SMALL realities into the online
battlefield! We need them to fight, we need them to rise, we need them to be
appreciated all over the world!</p>
<p>Why? Because the Italian craftsmanship just deserves this!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And this is the main reason why we are asking for your support!</p>

<p></p>
<p>The web portal will be based on a specific business model known
as the “Omni Channel Distribution” that allows producers to manage the products
availability among retail, outlet and online channels through the clouding
system. The MADE-IT Store will collect all the best Made in Italy products such
as shoes, bags, accessories and cashmere apparel and it will put them on-line
in order to spread the Italian manufacturing at international level! The Store
is going to be international, integrated and perfectly synchronized with the
producers stock availability. </p>
<p>The products will be exclusive, handmade with high quality
materials and characterized by a typical fashion Italian style. The average
price for the selected products will be between 300 and 400 dollars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To succeed, we count on our close connection with those SMALL
realities made of artisans, high-quality products and sense of styling. We
count on our understanding of how much important is the relation between
producer and consumer. </p>
<p>But this is not enough! WE COUNT ON YOU to make all of this a

MADE IN ITALY JUST DESERVES IT!
For 10 years we have been working with SMALL Italian
manufacturing companies … doing what? Just management consulting! Boring
management consulting ;) 
We have been in their SMALL factories, we have seen their
potential, we touched the quality characterizing the Italian craftsmanship
world.
We realized how the qualities embedded in artisan thinking and
creation reflect some of today’s society most significant values: attention to
details, ability to adjust, empathy, flexibility, and sustainability.
So now what? 
We want to take those SMALL realities into the online
battlefield! We need them to fight, we need them to rise, we need them to be
appreciated all over the world!
Why? Because the Italian craftsmanship just deserves this!


And this is the main reason why we are asking for your support!
Our project objective is to design, create and manage a unique
Made in Italy web portal: the MADE IT Store.



The web portal will be based on a specific business model known
as the “Omni Channel Distribution” that allows producers to manage the products
availability among retail, outlet and online channels through the clouding
system. The MADE-IT Store will collect all the best Made in Italy products such
as shoes, bags, accessories and cashmere apparel and it will put them on-line
in order to spread the Italian manufacturing at international level! The Store
is going to be international, integrated and perfectly synchronized with the
producers stock availability. 
The products will be exclusive, handmade with high quality
materials and characterized by a typical fashion Italian style. The average
price for the selected products will be between 300 and 400 dollars.

To succeed, we count on our close connection with those SMALL
realities made of artisans, high-quality products and sense of styling. We
count on our understanding of how much important is the relation between
producer and consumer. 
But this is not enough! WE COUNT ON YOU to make all of this a
BIG opportunity for the Made in Italy brand!
It’s not just about designing a web site – we need much more!
See yourself why…

<h2><strong>About me                                               </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Katrin Leiber</strong></h3>
<p>I was born in Germany. At a young age I became interested in art and design and decided that Paris was the best place for me to be. After passing my A-levels I moved from Germany to Paris to study fashion design at “ESMOD Paris”. In 1996 I received the first prize of ESMOD as best student of my year. <br/> After this first step in the fashion world, I have started my professional life by working for several brands I made an early start as freelance designer. <br/> After I started my career as designer I decided to create my personal vision of fashion. The dream came true in January 2003 when I presented my first handbag collection for winter 2004, illustrating my talent in design.</p>
<p>In October 2009 I presented my first shoe collection of changeable heels(screw type) at the the trade show “Premiere Class “in Paris.The press releases were very positive.When creating my second collection I realised that my designs would be limited as all the heels had to be round because of the screw system.This was the start of the new system which I started with my father, a well-known engineer in the automobile industry. I am now reay to start a brand new technology and Must-Have in women's shoes.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3><strong>AS SEEN IN :</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a501/leiberk/logospresse_zpsad35ed0c.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""presse""/></p>
<p><em><strong>and more.......</strong><br/></em></p>
<p><em>""<strong>ELLE</strong> (Germany)” in the September 2005 edition presented me as a new talent with a great future in the fashion world, they also underlined my original and personal conception of accessories. </em><br/><em> “<strong>Lucky</strong> (USA)”selected me as one of the 8 best new designers worldwide and presented my portrait and biography in the September edition 2006. </em><br/><em> “<strong>C+ Accessoires</strong> (France)” presented me in 2007 as the “rising star of leather goods”. </em><br/><em> <strong>SWR</strong>, a german television channel, selected me in 2009 as one of the best European new Designers. </em></p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>OUR STORY</strong></h2>
<p>We offer a new possibility in women's footwear with our patented idea of making high heels with changeable heels. These are expressed in thoughtful designs, handmade in Italy using ecologically advanced technology in sophisticated forms and materials. The major part of the heels can be also produced by 3 D printing which allows incredible heels designs never seen before. This production tool is absolutely new in the shoe industry.</p>
<p>Now women have the freedom to change shoe heels according to the mood or situation they are in. Just with a few adjustments they are ready for work, clubbing, shopping and so on. Heels ruined on curb stones are no longer a disaster- just click on a new heel and the shoe is brand new or has another style.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.katrin-leiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/black_peep_toe.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""black peep toe""/></p>
<p><em>Picture of black high heel with changeable leather heels</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Getting it right in combining Italian fitting and workmanship with German high-tech tools for heels also meant finding a manufacturer whose “got it”. Our partners for the development of the changeable heel system and manufacturing of the heels are based in Munich and Dieburg, Germany. Our partner for the shoe development and production is based in Italy’s specialized shoe region “Le Marche“ (near Ancona). This region is known as the heart of the Italian footwear industry. Artisans here have honed their skills over generations. Just as our manufacturer has done for other well-known labels, each high heel is tailored and manufactured using the finest materials.</p>

<p><em>Picture of black high heels with changeable Swarovski crystal heels</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is the difference between our technology and other changeable heel systems?</h2>
<p>- We can offer any heel design as the ouside of the heel is just a cover  stuck to the heel itself</p>
<p>- We can use new technology like 3 D printing and produce designs not possible with inject molding</p>
<p>- We do not need  extra soles inside or outside the shoe to fix the heel</p>
<p>- Our shoes can be of the same design as shoes without the changeable heel system</p>
<p>- Our system is very light beause it is made of abs plastic which is as solid as metal, but lighter in weight</p>
<h2>Why don't we offer heels of different heights?</h2>
<p>Even a few millimeters difference in the height will destroy the perfection of the shoes. You might even have some back pain from walking with heels that are not perfectly balanced.</p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>COLLECTION</strong></h2>
<h3>Collection Details:</h3>
<p>- Patented heel system made in German<em>y</em></p>
<p>- Shoes handmade in Italy<br/> - High quality and eco-friendly materials <br/> - Shoes are delivered in a very high quality, sophisticated shoe box with  2 extra shoe bags, 1 heel bag and a certificate of authenticity</p>

<h2><strong>THE IMPACT </strong></h2>
<p>Having the freedom to change shoe heels according to your mood or situation you are in. This is what I want to feature to all women in the world.</p>
<p>In short: one shoe + different heels = endless, funky styles and looks!</p>
<p>The project is in its final stage and ready for production. To make all of this happen I need your help. I need to raise $38.000 to purchase the first inventory. If you like the shoes and want your own pair with changeable heels, please buy your limited, first founder edition shoes through Indiegogo.<br/> Participating now is the only way you can get the limited, founder edition shoes and heels. These come with a special metallic edition logo and a numbered certificate of authenticity, with special discounts of up to 30% off post-launch retail pricing, because we change the euro price into dollar price for this project. Within one month after we completed our Indiegogo project successfully, we will email you to finalize the style and size you wish to order.<br/> When you buy high-quality pumps and high heels, they can last longer and save you money in the long-run. Your cost per wear can be lower with high-quality shoes that last for several years than cheaper one that lasts for only one season. Shoes with changeable heels save you even more money. If your heel is damaged you don´t need to dump your shoes - with few adjustments you practically have a new pair of shoes!</p>

<h2 class=""Standard1""><strong>Über Katrin Leiber</strong></h2>
<p class=""Standard1"">Ich bin in Mannheim geboren und habe mich schon früh für Kunst und Design interessiert. Deshalb bin ich nach meinem Abitur nach Paris gegangen, um an der berühmten ESMOD Schule Modedesign zu studieren. Hier habe ich 1996 als Jahrgangsbeste in den Fächern Styliste und Modeliste abgeschlossen.</p>
<p class=""Standard1"">Während einiger Stationen als Freelancer bei namhaften Modefirmen reifte in mir immer mehr der Traum eine eigene Handtaschenkollektion mit meiner ganz persönlichen Handschrift zu kreieren. Im Januar 2003 wurde der Traum Realität und ich präsentierte meine erste Handtaschenkollektion für Herbst / Winter 2003.</p>
<p class=""Standard1"">Im Oktober 2008 präsentierte ich meine erste Schuhkollektion mit auswechselbaren Absätzen (damals noch ein einfaches Schraubsystem) auf der Prèmiere Class in Paris. Für diese Idee habe ich bereits damals schon einige positive Pressestimmen geerntet. Beim Designen der zweiten Kollektion wurde mir klar, dass ich mit diesem Schraubsystem zu limitiert war im Design der Absätze, weil diese alle rund sein mussten. Ich habe deshalb gerne die Hilfe meines Vaters, einem renommierten Ingenieur aus der Automobilbranche, angenommen. Heute kann ich ein System präsentieren, das technisch absolut neuartig ist und das Potential für ein absolutes must have bei Damenschuhen hat…</p>
<h3 class=""Standard1"">GESEHEN IN:</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a501/leiberk/logospresse_zpsad35ed0c.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""presse""/></p>
<p><em><strong>und mehr............</strong><br/></em></p>
<p><em>Die deutsche Elle präsentierte mich in der Ausgabe vom September 2005 als ein neues Talent mit großer Zukunft in der Modewelt. Auch mein eigenständiger, unverwechselbarer  Stil wurde lobend erwähnt.</em></p>
<p><em>Die amerikanische Lucky kürte mich im Herbst 2006 zu einer de acht besten Nachwuchsdesignerinen  weltweit und präsentierte ein Portrait von mir.</em></p>
<p><em>Das französische Magazin C+ accesoires titelte in der März 2007 Ausgabe «der aufgehende Stern bei Lederwaren»</em></p>
<p><em>Der Fernsehsender SWR wählte mich in einem Fernsehbeitrag im Jahr 2009 zu einer der besten europäischen Designer.</em></p>
<h2 class=""Standard1""><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2 class=""Standard1""><strong>Unsere Geschichte</strong></h2>
<p class=""Standard1"">Mit unserem patentierten System für Pumps und High Heels mit auswechselbaren Absätzen eröffnen wir völlig neue Möglichkeiten im Bereich der Damenschuhe. Diese erscheinen in ansprechenden Designs, werden in Italien per Hand unter Berücksichtigung  ökonomischer und ökologischer Standards mit anspruchsvollen Materialien gefertigt.  Der größte Teil der Absätze kann dabei auch mit 3 D Druckverfahren hergestellt werden, was bisher noch nie gesehene Designs bei den Absätzen ermöglicht. Diese Technik kam bisher in der Schuhindustrie noch nie zum Einsatz.</p>
<p class=""Standard1"">Als Frau die Freiheit zu haben sich, mit wenigen Handgriffen, auf die aktuelle Stimmung oder Situation einzustellen. An Bordsteinkanten ruinierte Absätze bedeuten jetzt nicht mehr den Verlust eines geliebten Schuhs. Einfach einen neuen Absatz angebracht und der Schuh ist wieder wie neu.</p>

<p class=""StandardWeb1"">Unsere Pumps und High Heels sind dabei eine Deutsch / Italienische High-Tech Koproduktion und es war gar nicht so einfach die passenden Partner zu finden. In Deutschland sitzt die Entwicklung des Systems in München, die Produktion der Absätze in Dieburg. Unsere italienischen Partner, die für die Entwicklung und perfekte Passform der Schuhe verantwortlich sind, haben in der Gegend um Ancona (Region le Marche) ihren Firmensitz. Diese Region ist bekannt als das Herzstück italienischer Schuhmanufaktur und die Mitarbeiter in den Firmen haben über Generationen das Handwerk verfeinert.

<p class=""Standard1""><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 class=""Standard1""><strong>Worin liegen die Unterschiede unseres Systems im Vergleich zu anderen System am Markt?</strong></h2>
<p class=""Standard1""><strong> Designvorteil</strong>: unser Absatz ist eine Hülle ohne tragende Funktion. Deshalb können wir Produktionsverfahren wie 3 D Druck, um bisher nie da gewesene Designs zu produzieren.</p>
<p class=""Standard1""><strong>Produktionsvorteil:</strong> durch den Einsatz von 3 D Druckverfahren können wir sehr schnell und flexibel kleine und große Stückzahlen (nach)-produzieren.</p>
<p class=""Standard1""><strong>Kostenvorteil</strong>: wir benötigen bei der Produktion der  Absätze weniger Material und haben ein einfaches Rastsystem, das auf zusätzliche Sohlen / Halteschienen verzichtet.</p>
<p class=""Standard1""> <strong>Besserer Tragekomfort: </strong>unsere Schuhe sind perfekt austariert und bieten damit einen hervorragenden Tragekomfort. Bei den anderen Systemen  mit unterschiedlichen Absatzhöhen stimmt die Statik nicht mehr und dadurch ist der Tragekomfort extrem eingeschränkt. Dies kann dauerhaft zu Gelenkschädigungen führen.</p>
<p class=""StandardWeb1""> </p>
<h2 class=""Standard1""><strong>Warum bieten wir keine unterschiedlichen Absatzhöhen bei einem Modell an?</strong></h2>
<p class=""Standard1"">Bei Systemen mit unterschiedlichen Absatzhöhen stimmt die Statik nicht mehr und dadurch ist der Tragekomfort extrem eingeschränkt. Dies kann dauerhaft zu Gelenkschädigungen führen. Selbst ein paar Millimeter Höhenunterschied sind spürbar.</p>

<p class=""Standard1"">Schwarzer Peep toe mit Zebraabsatz</p>

<p class=""Standard1""><em>Zebraabsatz</em></p>
<h2 class=""Standard1""><strong>Die Wirkung</strong></h2>
<p class=""Standard1"">Als Frau die Freiheit zu haben den Schuh der jeweiligen Stimmung oder Bedarf anzupassen. Das ist es, was ich allen Frauen in dieser Welt ermöglichen möchte.</p>
<p class=""Standard1"">Kurz gesagt: eine Schuh + verschiedene Absätze = unendlich viele Styles und Looks!</p>
<p class=""Standard1"">Das Projekt ist in der Produktionsreife. Um die Produktion zu starten benötige ich ihre Hilfe. Ich brauche 38.000 $, um die erste Kleinserie zu produzieren. Wenn Ihnen die Schuhe gefallen und sie als eine der ersten ihr erstes Paar High Heels mit auswechselbaren Absätzen in der Hand halten wollen, kaufen Sie dieses einfach als limitierte Edition auf Indiegogo.</p>
<p class=""Standard1"">Das ist die einzige Möglichkeit, wie sie an die ersten limited Edition High Heels und Absätze gelangen können. Diese Edition ist mit einer speziellen Metallplakette im inneren des Schuhs und einem Echtheitszertifikat ausgestattet. Und das zu einem Spezialpreis mit bis zu 30% Rabatt, weil wir die € Preise einfach 1 zu 1 in $ Preise umgewandelt haben.</p>
<p class=""Standard1"">Innerhalb eines Monat nach Abschluss des Projekts auf Indiegogo bekommen sie von uns eine Bestätigungs-Email mit ihrer Bestellung und dem Auslieferungstermin.</p>
<p class=""Standard1"">Qualitativ hochwertige Schuhe sparen bares Geld, denn sie halten länger als billige Saisonware und geben ein gutes Gefühl beim Tragen, weil sie eine perfekte Passform haben.</p>
<p class=""Standard1"">Schuhe mit auswechselbaren Absätzen von Katrin Leiber sparen mehrfach, denn ruinierte Absätze bedeuten jetzt nicht mehr den Verlust des geliebten Schuhs. Einfach den Absatz gewechselt und der Schuh ist wie neu. Auch das gute Gefühl beim Tragen wird gesteigert, weil sie jetzt die Freiheit haben den Schuh ihrer Stimmung oder dem Anlass anzupassen.</p>
<h2 class=""Standard1""><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2 class=""Standard1""><strong>Warum dem Projekt auf die Beine helfen? </strong></h2>
<p class=""Standard1"">- Helfen sie die Kosten der ersten Produktion für Herbst / Winter 2013 mit zu tragen</p>

<p class=""FreieForm""> </p>
<h2 class=""FreieForm"">Katrin Leiber</h2>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Je suis née en Allemagne. Très tôt, j‘ai été attirée par le monde artistique: la peinture et la mode,  ce qui me poussa à m’installer à Paris en 1993, pour intégrer l’école de mode « ESMOD Paris » dont je suis sortie major de ma promotion.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Après une première étape d’apprentissage chez des créateurs, j‘ai décidé de me lancer comme styliste free lance. Dès mes premiers pas dans le monde de la mode, je souhaitais exprimer ma vision personnelle de mon univers créatif.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Ce sera chose faite en 2003 : je lance ma propre ligne d’accessoires, en exprimant ma sensibilité et mon talent dans une première collection de sacs à mains.</p>

<p class=""FreieForm""><em>« ELLE » dans son édition de Septembre 2005 présente Katrin Leiber comme nouveau talent dans l’accessoire, en soulignant également l’originalité et le style très personnel de mes créations.</em></p>

<p class=""FreieForm"">En octobre 2008 j‘ai présenté ma première collection de chaussures avec les talons échangeables au salon d‘accessoires Première Classe de Paris.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">L‘accueil  positive de la presse me rendait consciente du potentiel de cette idée. Pendant le développement de ma deuxième collection j‘ai corrigé le système initial d‘hélice grâce à l‘aide de mon père, un ingénieur renommé de l‘industrie automobile. La chaussure doit être au maximum confortable et surtout la parfaite stabilité du talon doit être assurée. Mon système de talons échangeables est techniquement une nouveauté absolue. Aujourd‘hui il est breveté internationalement ( PCT ). </p>
<p class=""FreieForm""> <img alt=""peep toe with black &amp; white Swarovski heels"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.katrin-leiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/black_peep_toe_with_chrystals.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""black peep toe with chsytal heels""/></p>
<h2 class=""FreieForm"">Notre histoire</h2>
<p class=""FreieForm"">On ouvre des possibilités infinies à l‘univers des chaussures aux femmes grâce à notre système breveté de talons hauts échangeables.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Infinies au niveau du design et pratiques pour la femme, qui aura enfin la liberté de changer ses talons selon ses envies ou situations de vie: du bureau au shopping et ensuite au cocktail sans perdre du temps. Avec très peu de manipulation: d‘un simple ‘‘clic ‘‘ et la chaussure s‘adapte à votre envie dans la vie quotidienne. </p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Les talons abimés au bordures de trottoir ne poseront plus de problème et n‘entraineront pas la perte de votre chaussure aimée: avec un simple ‘‘clic ‘‘ la chaussure est neuve. L‘avantage de la diversité au niveau du design s‘explique toute seule. Je vais créer de nombreux modèles de talons ce qui permettra d‘avoir un choix interminable.  Il me sera donc facile de changer: la couleur, la matière et le design selon les saisons et mes inspirations.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm""> </p>
<h2 class=""FreieForm"">L‘aspect production: </h2>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Nous fabriquons en co-production, notre production est aujourd‘hui une symbiose du savoir-faire de chaque partenaire: </p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">En Allemagne nous avons développé le système technique et la production des talons et en Italie la fabrication. </p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Nous avons su trouver le fabricant adapté à nos exigences en Italie, pays spécialisé et renommé  pour la production de la chaussure dans le monde entier. </p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Nos partenaires italiens fabriquent les chaussures manuellement et selon des critères strictes économiquement et écologiquement. Nous exigeons des matériaux nobles. Nos manufactures ont sublimé leurs artisanat sur des générations et ils produisent aussi bien pour d‘autres marques réputées.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Je peux produire la plus grande partie des talons avec une imprimante 3D, ce qui me permet des choix infinis au niveau du design avec une technique jamais vue dans l‘industrie des chaussures. </p>
<p class=""FreieForm""> Les avantages de notre système des talons échangeables par rapport aux concurrents </p>
<p class=""FreieForm""> </p>
<h3 class=""FreieForm"">Design: </h3>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Une gaine se clipsant sur un talon stable.  Cela nous permet une technologie comme l‘impression en 3D, donc en conséquence des possibilités de design infinies. </p>
<h3 class=""FreieForm"">Production: </h3>
<p class=""FreieForm"">La mise en jeu de l‘imprimante 3D nous permet de produire sur des délais courts et d‘être très flexible: en petite ou en grande quantité.</p>
<h3 class=""FreieForm"">Coûts: </h3>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Il nous faut peu de matériel pour les talons. Un simple système de clip d‘accrochage nous permet d‘éviter les rails de retenue et souliers supplémentaires.     </p>
<p class=""FreieForm""> </p>
<h2 class=""FreieForm"">GRAND CONFORT À PORTER:</h2>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Nos chaussures sont précisément équilibrées, ce qui permet un confort absolu.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Les systèmes avec différentes hauteurs des talons ne peuvent pas garantir la stabilité et peuvent provoquer des atteints articulaires.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm""> </p>
<h2 class=""FreieForm"">Collection</h2>
<h3 class=""FreieForm"">Détails</h3>

<p class=""FreieForm""> </p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Avoir la liberté en tant que femme d‘adapter à son humeur, ses envies ou ses besoins sa chaussure. C‘est ce que je veux rendre possible aux femmes de ce monde.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm""><strong>En bref: une chaussure + divers talons = des styles et looks infinis.</strong></p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Mon projet est à maturité de production. Il me faut de l‘aide pour commencer la première production : 38 000 $ pour le début d‘un lançement de la première petite série. Si mes chaussures vous plaisent et si vous voulez être parmi les premières à posséder une paire de high heels avec talons échangeables, vous pouvez les acheter en exclusivité sur Indiegogo en édition limitée.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Dès maintenant profitez de la seule possibilité de recevoir la première édition limitée de mes talons hauts. Cette édition contient un certificat d‘authenticité et une vignette de métal exclusive. Nos prix sur Indiegogo permettent une économie de près de 30% car nous avons adapté le taux de change pour qu‘un euro vale un dollar.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Vous allez recevoir un mois, après l‘achèvement du projet sur Indiegogo notre mail de confirmation avec votre commande avec la date précise de livraison.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Des chaussures de grande qualité vous permettent de faire une importante économie. Ils durent plus de temps que des produits bon marché et ils vous donnent un bon sentiment, car ils sont d‘un confort absolu.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Les chaussures avec les talons échangeables de Katrin Leiber permettent de multiples économies car un talon cassé n‘est plus synonyme de mise au rebus de votre paire de chaussure préférée.</p>
<p class=""FreieForm"">Juste un clic et le talon est échangé et la chaussure comme neuve. A partir de maintenant, vous avez la liberté d‘adapter la chaussure à votre humeur et la situation, vous offrant de la fantaisie chaque fois que vous les portez... </p>

About me                                               
Katrin Leiber
I was born in Germany. At a young age I became interested in art and design and decided that Paris was the best place for me to be. After passing my A-levels I moved from Germany to Paris to study fashion design at “ESMOD Paris”. In 1996 I received the first prize of ESMOD as best student of my year.  After this first step in the fashion world, I have started my professional life by working for several brands I made an early start as freelance designer.  After I started my career as designer I decided to create my personal vision of fashion. The dream came true in January 2003 when I presented my first handbag collection for winter 2004, illustrating my talent in design.
In October 2009 I presented my first shoe collection of changeable heels(screw type) at the the trade show “Premiere Class “in Paris.The press releases were very positive.When creating my second collection I realised that my designs would be limited as all the heels had to be round because of the screw system.This was the start of the new system which I started with my father, a well-known engineer in the automobile industry. I am now reay to start a brand new technology and Must-Have in women's shoes.
 
AS SEEN IN :

and more.......
""ELLE (Germany)” in the September 2005 edition presented me as a new talent with a great future in the fashion world, they also underlined my original and personal conception of accessories.  “Lucky (USA)”selected me as one of the 8 best new designers worldwide and presented my portrait and biography in the September edition 2006.  “C+ Accessoires (France)” presented me in 2007 as the “rising star of leather goods”.  SWR, a german television channel, selected me in 2009 as one of the best European new Designers.

We offer a new possibility in women's footwear with our patented idea of making high heels with changeable heels. These are expressed in thoughtful designs, handmade in Italy using ecologically advanced technology in sophisticated forms and materials. The major part of the heels can be also produced by 3 D printing which allows incredible heels designs never seen before. This production tool is absolutely new in the shoe industry.
Now women have the freedom to change shoe heels according to the mood or situation they are in. Just with a few adjustments they are ready for work, clubbing, shopping and so on. Heels ruined on curb stones are no longer a disaster- just click on a new heel and the shoe is brand new or has another style.

Getting it right in combining Italian fitting and workmanship with German high-tech tools for heels also meant finding a manufacturer whose “got it”. Our partners for the development of the changeable heel system and manufacturing of the heels are based in Munich and Dieburg, Germany. Our partner for the shoe development and production is based in Italy’s specialized shoe region “Le Marche“ (near Ancona). This region is known as the heart of the Italian footwear industry. Artisans here have honed their skills over generations. Just as our manufacturer has done for other well-known labels, each high heel is tailored and manufactured using the finest materials.

What is the difference between our technology and other changeable heel systems?
- We can offer any heel design as the ouside of the heel is just a cover  stuck to the heel itself
- We can use new technology like 3 D printing and produce designs not possible with inject molding
- We do not need  extra soles inside or outside the shoe to fix the heel
- Our shoes can be of the same design as shoes without the changeable heel system
- Our system is very light beause it is made of abs plastic which is as solid as metal, but lighter in weight
Why don't we offer heels of different heights?
Even a few millimeters difference in the height will destroy the perfection of the shoes. You might even have some back pain from walking with heels that are not perfectly balanced.
 
COLLECTION
Collection Details:

THE IMPACT 
Having the freedom to change shoe heels according to your mood or situation you are in. This is what I want to feature to all women in the world.
In short: one shoe + different heels = endless, funky styles and looks!
The project is in its final stage and ready for production. To make all of this happen I need your help. I need to raise $38.000 to purchase the first inventory. If you like the shoes and want your own pair with changeable heels, please buy your limited, first founder edition shoes through Indiegogo. Participating now is the only way you can get the limited, founder edition shoes and heels. These come with a special metallic edition logo and a numbered certificate of authenticity, with special discounts of up to 30% off post-launch retail pricing, because we change the euro price into dollar price for this project. Within one month after we completed our Indiegogo project successfully, we will email you to finalize the style and size you wish to order. When you buy high-quality pumps and high heels, they can last longer and save you money in the long-run. Your cost per wear can be lower with high-quality shoes that last for several years than cheaper one that lasts for only one season. Shoes with changeable heels save you even more money. If your heel is damaged you don´t need to dump your shoes - with few adjustments you practically have a new pair of shoes!

- Help cover the remaining cost of the first ever mass production order for fall /winter 2013

Katrin Leibers Designer Pumps und High Heels mit dem besonderen Kick – der Absatz ist auswechselbar und kann je nach Stimmung oder Anlass beliebig ausgetauscht werden.
                                                                                                           
Über Katrin Leiber
Ich bin in Mannheim geboren und habe mich schon früh für Kunst und Design interessiert. Deshalb bin ich nach meinem Abitur nach Paris gegangen, um an der berühmten ESMOD Schule Modedesign zu studieren. Hier habe ich 1996 als Jahrgangsbeste in den Fächern Styliste und Modeliste abgeschlossen.
Während einiger Stationen als Freelancer bei namhaften Modefirmen reifte in mir immer mehr der Traum eine eigene Handtaschenkollektion mit meiner ganz persönlichen Handschrift zu kreieren. Im Januar 2003 wurde der Traum Realität und ich präsentierte meine erste Handtaschenkollektion für Herbst / Winter 2003.
Im Oktober 2008 präsentierte ich meine erste Schuhkollektion mit auswechselbaren Absätzen (damals noch ein einfaches Schraubsystem) auf der Prèmiere Class in Paris. Für diese Idee habe ich bereits damals schon einige positive Pressestimmen geerntet. Beim Designen der zweiten Kollektion wurde mir klar, dass ich mit diesem Schraubsystem zu limitiert war im Design der Absätze, weil diese alle rund sein mussten. Ich habe deshalb gerne die Hilfe meines Vaters, einem renommierten Ingenieur aus der Automobilbranche, angenommen. Heute kann ich ein System präsentieren, das technisch absolut neuartig ist und das Potential für ein absolutes must have bei Damenschuhen hat…
GESEHEN IN:

und mehr............
Die deutsche Elle präsentierte mich in der Ausgabe vom September 2005 als ein neues Talent mit großer Zukunft in der Modewelt. Auch mein eigenständiger, unverwechselbarer  Stil wurde lobend erwähnt.
Die amerikanische Lucky kürte mich im Herbst 2006 zu einer de acht besten Nachwuchsdesignerinen  weltweit und präsentierte ein Portrait von mir.
Das französische Magazin C+ accesoires titelte in der März 2007 Ausgabe «der aufgehende Stern bei Lederwaren»
Der Fernsehsender SWR wählte mich in einem Fernsehbeitrag im Jahr 2009 zu einer der besten europäischen Designer.
 
Unsere Geschichte
Mit unserem patentierten System für Pumps und High Heels mit auswechselbaren Absätzen eröffnen wir völlig neue Möglichkeiten im Bereich der Damenschuhe. Diese erscheinen in ansprechenden Designs, werden in Italien per Hand unter Berücksichtigung  ökonomischer und ökologischer Standards mit anspruchsvollen Materialien gefertigt.  Der größte Teil der Absätze kann dabei auch mit 3 D Druckverfahren hergestellt werden, was bisher noch nie gesehene Designs bei den Absätzen ermöglicht. Diese Technik kam bisher in der Schuhindustrie noch nie zum Einsatz.
Als Frau die Freiheit zu haben sich, mit wenigen Handgriffen, auf die aktuelle Stimmung oder Situation einzustellen. An Bordsteinkanten ruinierte Absätze bedeuten jetzt nicht mehr den Verlust eines geliebten Schuhs. Einfach einen neuen Absatz angebracht und der Schuh ist wieder wie neu.

Unsere Pumps und High Heels sind dabei eine Deutsch / Italienische High-Tech Koproduktion und es war gar nicht so einfach die passenden Partner zu finden. In Deutschland sitzt die Entwicklung des Systems in München, die Produktion der Absätze in Dieburg. Unsere italienischen Partner, die für die Entwicklung und perfekte Passform der Schuhe verantwortlich sind, haben in der Gegend um Ancona (Region le Marche) ihren Firmensitz. Diese Region ist bekannt als das Herzstück italienischer Schuhmanufaktur und die Mitarbeiter in den Firmen haben über Generationen das Handwerk verfeinert. Unsere Firmen arbeiten auch für andere namhafte Marken.

Worin liegen die Unterschiede unseres Systems im Vergleich zu anderen System am Markt?
 Designvorteil: unser Absatz ist eine Hülle ohne tragende Funktion. Deshalb können wir Produktionsverfahren wie 3 D Druck, um bisher nie da gewesene Designs zu produzieren.
Produktionsvorteil: durch den Einsatz von 3 D Druckverfahren können wir sehr schnell und flexibel kleine und große Stückzahlen (nach)-produzieren.
Kostenvorteil: wir benötigen bei der Produktion der  Absätze weniger Material und haben ein einfaches Rastsystem, das auf zusätzliche Sohlen / Halteschienen verzichtet.
 Besserer Tragekomfort: unsere Schuhe sind perfekt austariert und bieten damit einen hervorragenden Tragekomfort. Bei den anderen Systemen  mit unterschiedlichen Absatzhöhen stimmt die Statik nicht mehr und dadurch ist der Tragekomfort extrem eingeschränkt. Dies kann dauerhaft zu Gelenkschädigungen führen.
 
Warum bieten wir keine unterschiedlichen Absatzhöhen bei einem Modell an?
Bei Systemen mit unterschiedlichen Absatzhöhen stimmt die Statik nicht mehr und dadurch ist der Tragekomfort extrem eingeschränkt. Dies kann dauerhaft zu Gelenkschädigungen führen. Selbst ein paar Millimeter Höhenunterschied sind spürbar.

Die Wirkung
Als Frau die Freiheit zu haben den Schuh der jeweiligen Stimmung oder Bedarf anzupassen. Das ist es, was ich allen Frauen in dieser Welt ermöglichen möchte.
Kurz gesagt: eine Schuh + verschiedene Absätze = unendlich viele Styles und Looks!
Das Projekt ist in der Produktionsreife. Um die Produktion zu starten benötige ich ihre Hilfe. Ich brauche 38.000 $, um die erste Kleinserie zu produzieren. Wenn Ihnen die Schuhe gefallen und sie als eine der ersten ihr erstes Paar High Heels mit auswechselbaren Absätzen in der Hand halten wollen, kaufen Sie dieses einfach als limitierte Edition auf Indiegogo.
Das ist die einzige Möglichkeit, wie sie an die ersten limited Edition High Heels und Absätze gelangen können. Diese Edition ist mit einer speziellen Metallplakette im inneren des Schuhs und einem Echtheitszertifikat ausgestattet. Und das zu einem Spezialpreis mit bis zu 30% Rabatt, weil wir die € Preise einfach 1 zu 1 in $ Preise umgewandelt haben.
Innerhalb eines Monat nach Abschluss des Projekts auf Indiegogo bekommen sie von uns eine Bestätigungs-Email mit ihrer Bestellung und dem Auslieferungstermin.
Qualitativ hochwertige Schuhe sparen bares Geld, denn sie halten länger als billige Saisonware und geben ein gutes Gefühl beim Tragen, weil sie eine perfekte Passform haben.
Schuhe mit auswechselbaren Absätzen von Katrin Leiber sparen mehrfach, denn ruinierte Absätze bedeuten jetzt nicht mehr den Verlust des geliebten Schuhs. Einfach den Absatz gewechselt und der Schuh ist wie neu. Auch das gute Gefühl beim Tragen wird gesteigert, weil sie jetzt die Freiheit haben den Schuh ihrer Stimmung oder dem Anlass anzupassen.

Talons hauts de Katrin Leiber avec un plus innovant : le talon est échangeable selon l‘occasion, l‘envie et l‘humeur.
 
Katrin Leiber
Je suis née en Allemagne. Très tôt, j‘ai été attirée par le monde artistique: la peinture et la mode,  ce qui me poussa à m’installer à Paris en 1993, pour intégrer l’école de mode « ESMOD Paris » dont je suis sortie major de ma promotion.
Après une première étape d’apprentissage chez des créateurs, j‘ai décidé de me lancer comme styliste free lance. Dès mes premiers pas dans le monde de la mode, je souhaitais exprimer ma vision personnelle de mon univers créatif.
Ce sera chose faite en 2003 : je lance ma propre ligne d’accessoires, en exprimant ma sensibilité et mon talent dans une première collection de sacs à mains.
Vu dans

et d ´autres...............

« ELLE » dans son édition de Septembre 2005 présente Katrin Leiber comme nouveau talent dans l’accessoire, en soulignant également l’originalité et le style très personnel de mes créations.
 « Lucky (USA) » a sélectionnée Katrin Leiber en 2006 parmi les 8 meilleurs nouveaux designers mondiaux.
 « C+ Accessoires » présente Katrin Leiber en 2007 comme « l’étoile montante de la maroquinerie »
 
En octobre 2008 j‘ai présenté ma première collection de chaussures avec les talons échangeables au salon d‘accessoires Première Classe de Paris.
L‘accueil  positive de la presse me rendait consciente du potentiel de cette idée. Pendant le développement de ma deuxième collection j‘ai corrigé le système initial d‘hélice grâce à l‘aide de mon père, un ingénieur renommé de l‘industrie automobile. La chaussure doit être au maximum confortable et surtout la parfaite stabilité du talon doit être assurée. Mon système de talons échangeables est techniquement une nouveauté absolue. Aujourd‘hui il est breveté internationalement ( PCT ). 
 
Notre histoire
On ouvre des possibilités infinies à l‘univers des chaussures aux femmes grâce à notre système breveté de talons hauts échangeables.
Infinies au niveau du design et pratiques pour la femme, qui aura enfin la liberté de changer ses talons selon ses envies ou situations de vie: du bureau au shopping et ensuite au cocktail sans perdre du temps. Avec très peu de manipulation: d‘un simple ‘‘clic ‘‘ et la chaussure s‘adapte à votre envie dans la vie quotidienne. 
Les talons abimés au bordures de trottoir ne poseront plus de problème et n‘entraineront pas la perte de votre chaussure aimée: avec un simple ‘‘clic ‘‘ la chaussure est neuve. L‘avantage de la diversité au niveau du design s‘explique toute seule. Je vais créer de nombreux modèles de talons ce qui permettra d‘avoir un choix interminable.  Il me sera donc facile de changer: la couleur, la matière et le design selon les saisons et mes inspirations.
 
L‘aspect production: 
Nous fabriquons en co-production, notre production est aujourd‘hui une symbiose du savoir-faire de chaque partenaire: 
En Allemagne nous avons développé le système technique et la production des talons et en Italie la fabrication. 
Nous avons su trouver le fabricant adapté à nos exigences en Italie, pays spécialisé et renommé  pour la production de la chaussure dans le monde entier. 
Nos partenaires italiens fabriquent les chaussures manuellement et selon des critères strictes économiquement et écologiquement. Nous exigeons des matériaux nobles. Nos manufactures ont sublimé leurs artisanat sur des générations et ils produisent aussi bien pour d‘autres marques réputées.
Je peux produire la plus grande partie des talons avec une imprimante 3D, ce qui me permet des choix infinis au niveau du design avec une technique jamais vue dans l‘industrie des chaussures. 
 Les avantages de notre système des talons échangeables par rapport aux concurrents 
 
Design: 
Une gaine se clipsant sur un talon stable.  Cela nous permet une technologie comme l‘impression en 3D, donc en conséquence des possibilités de design infinies. 
Production: 
La mise en jeu de l‘imprimante 3D nous permet de produire sur des délais courts et d‘être très flexible: en petite ou en grande quantité.
Coûts: 
Il nous faut peu de matériel pour les talons. Un simple système de clip d‘accrochage nous permet d‘éviter les rails de retenue et souliers supplémentaires.     
 
GRAND CONFORT À PORTER:
Nos chaussures sont précisément équilibrées, ce qui permet un confort absolu.
Les systèmes avec différentes hauteurs des talons ne peuvent pas garantir la stabilité et peuvent provoquer des atteints articulaires.

L‘impact
 
Avoir la liberté en tant que femme d‘adapter à son humeur, ses envies ou ses besoins sa chaussure. C‘est ce que je veux rendre possible aux femmes de ce monde.
En bref: une chaussure + divers talons = des styles et looks infinis.
Mon projet est à maturité de production. Il me faut de l‘aide pour commencer la première production : 38 000 $ pour le début d‘un lançement de la première petite série. Si mes chaussures vous plaisent et si vous voulez être parmi les premières à posséder une paire de high heels avec talons échangeables, vous pouvez les acheter en exclusivité sur Indiegogo en édition limitée.
Dès maintenant profitez de la seule possibilité de recevoir la première édition limitée de mes talons hauts. Cette édition contient un certificat d‘authenticité et une vignette de métal exclusive. Nos prix sur Indiegogo permettent une économie de près de 30% car nous avons adapté le taux de change pour qu‘un euro vale un dollar.
Vous allez recevoir un mois, après l‘achèvement du projet sur Indiegogo notre mail de confirmation avec votre commande avec la date précise de livraison.
Des chaussures de grande qualité vous permettent de faire une importante économie. Ils durent plus de temps que des produits bon marché et ils vous donnent un bon sentiment, car ils sont d‘un confort absolu.
Les chaussures avec les talons échangeables de Katrin Leiber permettent de multiples économies car un talon cassé n‘est plus synonyme de mise au rebus de votre paire de chaussure préférée.
Juste un clic et le talon est échangé et la chaussure comme neuve. A partir de maintenant, vous avez la liberté d‘adapter la chaussure à votre humeur et la situation, vous offrant de la fantaisie chaque fois que vous les portez...

<h2>A little bit about this lil' company I call GutterQueen...</h2>
<p>I started up <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/GutterQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GutterQueen Jewellery</a> as I've always been a very DIY kind of gal, and have now been running it single-handedly for nearly a year and a half. I always design for people who love a bit of colour, attitude and a big helping of studs, and aren't scared of standing apart from the rest. I've been lucky enough to have some of the most awesome customers around, which makes it worth every ounce of passion and effort that I pour into making the products.</p>
<p>I have SO many ideas for a brand new collection in mind that's ready to go, but it's near impossible to achieve as every penny that I make from selling the jewellery goes straight back into buying materials and keeping the company going. I had to take a break a few months ago, as trying to balance the business and my personal life and the finances of keeping GutterQueen afloat was becoming too much, but now I'm back and ready to be bigger than ever, and I really need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where the funds are going...</h3>
<p>Every single penny will go straight toward new products to ensure that I can provide you guys with some brand new, spankingly badass pieces!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>-</strong> I'm planning to branch out to acrylic necklaces and rings, which means there will be more variety in design and colours. Also will be introducing some really badass stickers and badges, which will be professionally designed!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>- I source a lot of my materials from abroad to make sure that the quality stays high but the prices for customers stay as low as possible. This means that with funding I can afford to ship over many more materials for new necklaces, hair fascinators and, most importantly, LOTS OF STUDS! :)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>- I have some AMAZING models on board for new promotional materials such as flyers, stickers and banners. A lot of this material will be used at a couple of tattoo conventions that I'm planning on having a trader's stall at this year, including the Manchester International Tattoo Show.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>- Plans for a new, proper GutterQueen Jewellery website are underway, and this funding would help to get it set up and professionally designed. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What it would mean...</h3>
<p>I've not asked for any financial help with my company before, as I've always been a bit stubborn ;) So every spare bit of money that I've used to fund it has been off my own back, so I really toyed with the idea of setting up this page. But without a doubt this money would completely change everything for GutterQueen, and help me provide you guys with some really amazing products, without a single pound being wasted. I've never really come from a well off background, and even though I've struggled sometimes in the past it's still such a huge passion for me, and £500 would mean the difference between GutterQueen sinking into nothingness, and GutterQueen getting taken to a completely new level. The appreciation I have for your help is beyond words.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know not everyone will be able to contribute, but even if you can't spare anything please do help get the word out. Share, share, share with your friends and on any social media platforms you possibly can! The more people that spread the word the more funds I'll be able to raise and that means better products for you all!</p>

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>About 3 months ago i was looking for more out of life and wanted to do something that made me happy for a living. I was out and about and came upon a yard sale where i saw a woman whose daughter had a great bow in her hair. I started talking with the woman about the bow and asked her where she got it from, she replied that a friend of hers had made it and she did not know where you could buy them from. I got to thinking and realized that it was a great product for kids but there was no where locally to buy them from. I want to Walmart and bought all the supplies i needed and got to work. I created a bunch of bows and started showing them off around town and to people with kids. The bows were a hit but due to the cost of materials i had to sell them for $5 each to turn a small profit and make it worth my time to keep making them. I faced a new problem and that was being able to buy materials in bulk so i could charge less for the bows and in the end sell more of them. This is where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>What i need to get started?</strong></p>
<p>I am in need of more capital so i can buy more materials in bulk and cut down on my cost of each bow. Currently i have to charge $5 for each bow but i would like to be able to charge $3 per bow to make them more affordable for people to buy while still getting a hand crafted designer bow.</p>
<p><strong>The End Result</strong></p>
<p>If i was able to raise $4,000 i would be able to really start rolling on making many more bows and take my business online. If i was able to charge less for the bows not only would i sell more but my customers would be able to get a great product at a fair price.</p>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">The coolest wallet for minimalists and artists</strong></p>
<p class=""Standard1""><br/><strong>Story:</strong><br/> Hi everybody there! I am Alexei Nagel, the developer and manufacturer of the Victoria wallet. It is my happy fortune to tinker crazy and unusual things, especially when it gives me a real pleasure. To test, to play and to tinker have been my passions since the time I can remember. Even as a child I tried to build my own bike. Later, wood sculptures, furniture, and even radios used to be my hobbies. I could never stop with tinkering! Why? Because I love it!</p>
<p class=""Standard1""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/885802/pictures/full/20130622022940-iphone.jpg?1371918586"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p class=""Standard1""><strong>Why a</strong><strong> wallet?</strong><br/> I was always in search of a special kind of wallet. Although the market is literally flooded with different kinds of wallets, there has never been anything suitable for me till now. I need a wallet that is like a shadow - everywhere with me. Thus, it must be easy and lie unobtrusive in my pocket, but being out of the pocket it must be an elegant eye-catcher. Finally, it keeps all my important documents together and deserves therefore a lot of attention.</p>
<p class=""Standard1""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/885792/pictures/full/20130622020948-visitenkarte.jpg?1371917398"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> About a year has passed from the moment as I started to tinker my own wallet. I remembered as being a little boy in kindergarten I made a kind of a “magic bag” from rubber bands and paper. After having made many various prototypes in the past months, I have finally achieved the result with which I can be very satisfied. And the best of all is: The wallet can be also designed individually. </p>
<p class=""Standard1""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/885801/pictures/full/20130622022627-schwarz_2.jpg?1371893189"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p class=""Standard1""><strong>Style:</strong><br/> The wallet Victoria has a simple design and is very practical for everyday life. Banknotes, credit cards, notes and receipts (and of course much more) can be easily stowed with the help of the wallet. The wallet Victoria has been an eye-catcher at numerous fairs - especially in combination with business cards. With the help of the eccentric function of the wallet I stayed in memory of many people and thus received significantly more callbacks from the interested. </p>
<p class=""Standard1""><strong>Universal:</strong><br/> The Victoria wallet is very light, has a comfortable size and lies well in the hand. The wallet can be quickly hidden in a trouser pocket or a pocket of a jacket and remains not obtrusive. Even in a woman's handbag, the Victoria wallet can be found very well.</p>

Story: Hi everybody there! I am Alexei Nagel, the developer and manufacturer of the Victoria wallet. It is my happy fortune to tinker crazy and unusual things, especially when it gives me a real pleasure. To test, to play and to tinker have been my passions since the time I can remember. Even as a child I tried to build my own bike. Later, wood sculptures, furniture, and even radios used to be my hobbies. I could never stop with tinkering! Why? Because I love it!

Why a wallet? I was always in search of a special kind of wallet. Although the market is literally flooded with different kinds of wallets, there has never been anything suitable for me till now. I need a wallet that is like a shadow - everywhere with me. Thus, it must be easy and lie unobtrusive in my pocket, but being out of the pocket it must be an elegant eye-catcher. Finally, it keeps all my important documents together and deserves therefore a lot of attention.
 About a year has passed from the moment as I started to tinker my own wallet. I remembered as being a little boy in kindergarten I made a kind of a “magic bag” from rubber bands and paper. After having made many various prototypes in the past months, I have finally achieved the result with which I can be very satisfied. And the best of all is: The wallet can be also designed individually. 

Style: The wallet Victoria has a simple design and is very practical for everyday life. Banknotes, credit cards, notes and receipts (and of course much more) can be easily stowed with the help of the wallet. The wallet Victoria has been an eye-catcher at numerous fairs - especially in combination with business cards. With the help of the eccentric function of the wallet I stayed in memory of many people and thus received significantly more callbacks from the interested. 
Universal: The Victoria wallet is very light, has a comfortable size and lies well in the hand. The wallet can be quickly hidden in a trouser pocket or a pocket of a jacket and remains not obtrusive. Even in a woman's handbag, the Victoria wallet can be found very well.


Material: After long considerations and countless tests the material for the purse has been finalized: acrylic glass. Acrylic glass is durable, light and can be multifunctionally used. Additionally acrylic has a high gloss finish and offers very good maintenance qualities.

Production: For the reason that the price of production remains adequate, the minimal produced quantity should be at least 300 wallets. It means at least 600 acrylic plates that are needed for the production. The acrylic plates are cut by a laser and brought to a right form. A pattern is engraved on one side of the plates, and then they are colored. Both acrylic plates are manually connected by an elastic rubber band. The used rubber band is very stable and extremely durable. I've been using my first prototype since 7 months – faultless and without any weaknesses. The rubber band remains in a good form even by an intensive usage of the wallet. 

Perks:










Further development: If I succeed in a start of the project – of course only with your great support - Victoria wallet has great potentials for further developments in different directions - for example in color, personalized engraving, different materials (leather, aluminum, wood, etc.). The possibilities are far from being exhausted.

Your support: At this point your support is needed to bring to life this type of a wallet. Manufacturing, packaging and logistics are funded with your support. Thanks a lot in advance for your interest in my project.

Risks: It is now almost a year passed since I've started working on the first Victoria wallet.  Many things have changed meanwhile. I have developed and optimized, and now I can proudly present you ""Victoria"". At this point I would like to thank you as active supporters. Still, I do not know how much interesting the wallet will be really. In case of really great interest, it can happen that the production will take more time and thus it may come to delays in deliveries. I would like to thank you in advance for your understanding.

</div><p>Our campaign is aimed to fund raise the seed money necessary for our first steps towards our BIG dream. Your contribution forms a big hope for us to start up our business that’s aimed to not only generate revenue for a limited number of people, but to contribute in boosting our country’s economy by creating lots of new jobs while significantly cutting cost for our customers - <i>our business model keeps a good balance between being smart and labor-based</i> - enabling them to create new revenue channels and typically an extraordinary profit growth.</p><div>
</div><p>Your contribution will help us to make significant improvement on how our customers (<i>mainly retailers &amp; SMEs</i>) run their business in much smarter way (by leveraging cutting-edge technologies of mobile/tablet POS (Point of Sale) &amp; apps, e-payment, e-commerce/m-commerce and cloud computing at these sectors) that will make the life of everyone doing shopping better (faster, more flexible, diverse, secure and cost efficient shopping will definitely mean better day and better life!).</p><div>
</div><p><b>The Start</b></p><div>
</div><p>Our planned investment for the first year is ~ USD 1.3M. Only an initial fund of USD 50K is required to make the first steps those are:</p><ul>

<h3>Why funding us?</h3>
<p>We are a small design brand. It allows us to focus on designing good products and to have a close relationship and follow-up with our customers. Using crowdfunding such as Indiegogo will help us keep our creative freedom.</p>
<p><b>Become a backer!</b> This campaign is a very secure and exclusive way for you to get our products at an <b>unbeatable price</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1275274/files/20150306223141-Lookbook-20.jpg?1425709901"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Where does your money go?</h3>
<p>Our number one goal is to make good products so about 85% of the money we will collect will be used to <b>making the watch</b> themselves. It will cover the design, development and production cost. The remaining 15% will be used to promote our products, take part of trade shows and help pay for our online store and sales expenses.</p>

<h3>How do I buy a watch?</h3>
<p>On the right side of our campaign page, a vertical banner shows you the different perks you can buy. Some of them will get you one or two watches in return. You can also get a special discount for our existing pocket watches on our online store.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How to specify the watch model and engraving?</h3>
<p>At the end of the campaign, we will send you an email in order to confirm your choice of watch model (and engraving - if you chose the ''Get your MMT engraved"" perk).Of course, you can already let us know your choice(s) by writing to sales@mmtstore.com, or you can think a little bit more and wait for our email!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Can I buy the watch after the campaign?</h3>
<p>After the Indiegogo campaign, the R series will be available for sale on our website and at selected retailers. The retail price will be $399 so you save a lot by buying the watch during the crowdfunding campaign!</p>
<p></p>

<h3>When will I receive my watch?</h3>
<p>Good news ! We have worked hard on shortening the production lead-time of our collection. Therefore, we will be able to deliver the 'R series' watch to you starting mid-June 2015!</p>

<p>Another good news! YES! We bare all costs relative to shipping, wherever you are! shipping is worldwide and free.</p>

</div></div>","Founded in 2011, MMT specialises in singular watches, blending quality watchmaking and poetic storytelling.
In all our products, we integrate our signature material: wood. As a lively material, all pieces of wood are unique in texture and age differently over time, making each MMT watch a one-of-a-kind piece.We believe that honesty and simplicity in design are the keys to make beautiful and lasting products. MMT watches are the perfect match for people in search of quality timepieces, easy to wear but with a unique twist and character.

So far, MMT has already successfully released two collections of pocket watches, the 'Calendar series' and the 'T series'. These two collections have been featured on several reference blogs and sold in design stores across the globe.
We are passionate about what we do and we are very excited to introduce our new collection, the 'R series'. We have come to Indiegogo to raise funds and with your help, bring our new collection to life!

The R series is an elegant wristwatch, combining very clean lines and rich textures and quality materials.
In line with MMT’s DNA, the new 'R series' features a delicate wooden ring, making a complete revolution around a domed glass.The secret of the 'R series' lies inside its case: it is powered by a Swiss parts movement that doesn’t require a crown to set the time, allowing the watch outline to remain perfectly circular.
Here are some key elements of the MMT 'R-series':



Clean and minimalist silhouette: In addition to its iconic silhouette, the 'R-series' reveals a minimalist design, perfected in details and use of quality materials.



No watch crown! A clean and elegant timepiece around your wrist! Easy to wear on your right or your left wrist.





Swiss parts movement: We sourced a very specific Swiss parts Movement from renown brand  ISAswiss.




Your MMT Revolution is unique: The 'R series' bezel, made of walnut wood, makes each watch a truly one-of -a-kind timepiece.




Engrave it! Make it even more personal by getting a message engraved at the back of the watch case. Perfect for a gift!





Premium stitched genuine leather strap: Comes in 2 colors: black and brown.




Each watch comes in a smart box: The packaging is sized to well protect your watch while using small shelving space.



Setting the time
At the back of the watch, just press on the central button with a pointy object to make the hands move forward (it works well with a pen).











Swiss parts movement from ISAswiss


All 316L Stainless Steel watch


Walnut wood bezel


Domed glass


Metallic or off-white embossed dial


Premium stitched leather strap 


Water resistant 3 ATM 


Watch diameter : 43 mm

Unisex, left and right handed!





The MMT R series collection includes 4 models:








Limited edition
The first 20 pieces of each model will be numbered 01/20 to 20/20. Make sure to order one before they sell out! (Numbers will be attributed chronologically)







Custom engraving
Select the engraving perk ($15) and we will engrave the message of your choice at the back of your R series. Your engraving can include up to 20 characters (including spaces).

We have managed to optimise the production lead time with our factory so that you can receive your watch as early as possible.
We plan on shipping your watch starting from mid June 2015.







Why funding us?
We are a small design brand. It allows us to focus on designing good products and to have a close relationship and follow-up with our customers. Using crowdfunding such as Indiegogo will help us keep our creative freedom.
Become a backer! This campaign is a very secure and exclusive way for you to get our products at an unbeatable price.


Where does your money go?
Our number one goal is to make good products so about 85% of the money we will collect will be used to making the watch themselves. It will cover the design, development and production cost. The remaining 15% will be used to promote our products, take part of trade shows and help pay for our online store and sales expenses.






In order to make MMT 'R series' campaign on Indiegogo successful, we need your support! 
You can help us by :



Buying perks on the right side of this page. This is a great opportunity to pre-order our new 'R series' collection at a special price!


Sharing our campaign through social medias , emails or your website and blog.


























How do I buy a watch?
On the right side of our campaign page, a vertical banner shows you the different perks you can buy. Some of them will get you one or two watches in return. You can also get a special discount for our existing pocket watches on our online store.

How to specify the watch model and engraving?
At the end of the campaign, we will send you an email in order to confirm your choice of watch model (and engraving - if you chose the ''Get your MMT engraved"" perk).Of course, you can already let us know your choice(s) by writing to sales@mmtstore.com, or you can think a little bit more and wait for our email!

Can I buy the watch after the campaign?
After the Indiegogo campaign, the R series will be available for sale on our website and at selected retailers. The retail price will be $399 so you save a lot by buying the watch during the crowdfunding campaign!


When will I receive my watch?
Good news ! We have worked hard on shortening the production lead-time of our collection. Therefore, we will be able to deliver the 'R series' watch to you starting mid-June 2015!
Do you ship everywhere? How much does it cost?
Another good news! YES! We bare all costs relative to shipping, wherever you are! shipping is worldwide and free.
Will there be any additional fees?
There may be additional fees specific to your countries such as VAT, import and customs fees. We do not cover these possible extras.
What is your refund policy?
Following Indiegogo terms and conditions, all contributions are definitive and we cannot refund you.

<br/>The ViveNchill has a runtime of 70,000 hours.  It should last as long if not longer than your Vive.  Premium MagLev vapo bearings ensure vibration free operation throughout it's lifespan.  To stay ahead of the curve, the ViveNchill is compatible with the HTC deluxe audio strap, TPCast wireless module, and current prototype DisplayLink XR. The ViveNchill is a perfect partner in crime for these upgrades since it allows for greater mobility and a bigger chance of being a sweat mongrel.<br/> </div>

However, wearing a bulky headset while being physically active is the perfect recipe for an uncomfortable and sweaty situation.  The ViveNchill is a heat fighter! It's effective, quiet, and discrete.  It's the perfect companion for your headset, keeping you cooler and more comfortable with the press of a button.  
See what people are saying about ViveNchill!
 





We iterated over many design choices when creating the ViveNchill.  Our initial prototypes focused on piping air into the headset.  Users complained about dry eyes, high noise levels, vibration, interference with the built in mic, and low cooling effect.  So we took things outside and directed airflow at the forehead and contact area with the facial foam.  We found a drastic improvement in its ability to cool you off with no negative side effects.  As an added benefit, reducing heat and moisture also reduced fogging and nausea.  The science behind the madnessAccording to research at Veostrip:""The forehead produced the largest absolute volume of sweat per unit of surface""""The forehead is the best heat dissipating skin on the body""“The forehead is particularly important to cooling and can dissipate heat at 4x the rate of the torso”“Bloodflow to the forehead increases by 12x during exercise, specifically to aid cooling”A similar study from Frontiers in Neuroscience states that “Conversely, although the head and neck represent only 7–9% of the total body surface area, even a small increase in heat loss from surface cooling of this region causes a relatively larger cooling of the body core (Pretorius et al., 2006)."" By directing air at and over this crucial part of the body, the ViveNchill helps reduce your overall temperature effectively in a compact package. Reference 1: Veostrip. “Science behind Veo.”, 2017, www.veostrip.com/science-behind-veoReference 2: Frontiers in Neuroscience. “Thermal Regulation of the Brain”, Jan. 2016, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4720747/#s7titleSwitch developmentVarious prototype partsInjection mold machine with 3 plate double cavity ViveNchill mold setup for run.Core of the ViveNchill mold with slider components made from high quality NAK80 Steel2+2 Cavity side mold with edge / pin gates made from high quality NAK80 SteelThe ViveNchill packs a 1-2-3 punch. A clean and discrete form factor is paired with effective cooling and an easily accessible on/off switch.  This allows you to regulate your temperature instantly based on the intensity of the game play.         Actual production injection molded components and custom cable harness with overmolded switch shown below. 












 




 
 

 
The ViveNchill uses high quality CE, CUR, TUV, and UL approved fans and draws under 200mAh from the accessory USB port.  The fans feature auto-stop and restart feature, and won't snag on hair, skin, clothing, or whatever else you feel like sticking in there.
 

 




The ViveNchill has a runtime of 70,000 hours.  It should last as long if not longer than your Vive.  Premium MagLev vapo bearings ensure vibration free operation throughout it's lifespan.  To stay ahead of the curve, the ViveNchill is compatible with the HTC deluxe audio strap, TPCast wireless module, and current prototype DisplayLink XR. The ViveNchill is a perfect partner in crime for these upgrades since it allows for greater mobility and a bigger chance of being a sweat mongrel.

Choose “cycling widget” in the app and pair remote with your PIX.  Simply add a Power Bank to your pledge and we'll deliver it to you with PIX backpack.We wanted to make something that helped people stand out from the crowd, be noticeable and visible, so we set out to make the reddest backpack out there.We developed PIX as a way to help people develop their creativity and share their unique vision with the world. We also loved the added fun factor that PIX brought to people’s everyday lives. PIX can be used as a customizable personal display to help in many different situations: meeting a person at the airport, indicating turns and stops for cyclists, playing old-school video games and so much more!   We can’t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make PIX a reality. We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can’t give a dollar or purchase a PIX backpack, if you’re a supporter of PIX, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!",33.0,6,"2 Campaigns

<p><span>The silent, soulful recognition in the eyes of the Oneida artisans as they watched a video of traditional Maasai song performed by OMWA:  Olorgesailie Maasai Women Artisans of Kenya, stirred my soul, I cried.  Something I often do as this process evolves.  Neither the Maasai or Oneida have time for tears so I have learned to hide my emotional outbursts.

</div></div>","SUMMARY
The silent, soulful recognition in the eyes of the Oneida artisans as they watched a video of traditional Maasai song performed by OMWA:  Olorgesailie Maasai Women Artisans of Kenya, stirred my soul, I cried.  Something I often do as this process evolves.  Neither the Maasai or Oneida have time for tears so I have learned to hide my emotional outbursts. But it was so beautiful, I don’t have the words to express it properly. 
At that moment sitting in the Oneida Nation of New York over 7,000 miles away from the small Maasai village in the South Rift Valley. I realized that a new creative community was born.  Back in March,  when I was in Olorgesailie with OMWA, I showed the Maasai women the amazing work of the Oneida artisans: the wampum Haudenosaunee bracelets, the bone and turquoise necklaces, the elaborate beading depicting flora and fauna.  The women excitedly placed the jewelry on their arms and necks, smiling, nodding, “Sidai! Sidai oleng,""  they exclaimed.  ""Beautiful, very beautiful!""  Mpuyuk, a Maasai elder woman said, ""Together we can take over the world.""    
My name is Tereneh Mosley of Idia'Dega, along with my creative partners OMWA and the Oneida Beading Wolves artisans we have co-designed, a first of its kind, global Indigenous eco-design collection.  A collaboration with Indigenous artisans working together across the globe.  We need you to help bring it to life. 
   

What we're doing and why we need youTo begin this global take over powered by passion, fabric and beads -  we have co-designed a collection based on the June flowering fruits that blossom in Olorgesailie and Oneida.  In Kenya, it’s the plum and in Oneida the strawberry. In fact, the Haudenosaunee people (the Oneida is one of the Six Nations) call June, Strawberry Moon.  Combining the environmental and cultural connections of these communities we created a collection that builds on these and other shared cultural, creative and environmental themes. 
We need your support to buy the sustainable fabrics and materials, beads (both artisans groups use the same Czech glass beads, size 11!) and to fund the artisans work.  
Another exciting thing is that we know our work will be presented this fall during New York Fashion Week in September, continuing our amazing collaboration with a gallery in Brooklyn.  So time is of the essence.  We have already designed the collection, now we need to bring it to life, with your help and only with your help, we can do it!

Risks & Challenges

 From living/working in a hut in the rural Rift Valley waiting for the OMWA women to agree to become our creative partners, to showing our first collection in Paris - to approaching our now, design partners Oneida Beading Wolves at a Pow-Wow last year in New York.  Every step of this process is a challenge, a beautiful challenge.  So far we meet each one and succeed.

<p>Nalla is a brand new and revolutionary type of swimwear that allows a single cut of stitchless Lycra to be used for multiple purposes. With a simple twist, knot or accessory, this patent pending design allows you to create unlimited styles and looks without compromising functionality or comfort. Now, you can transition from one look at the beach, to a different look at the party, and everything in between without going somewhere to change outfits. Our goal is to empower women by giving them a garment that suits various body types and can be used for many different applications. Our premium fabrics and color options will ensure there is a Nalla here for you!</p>

<p><span>                 <strong>            Our First Audience is Developers of Content.  </strong>Here and in Part 1 - ""Inside NULYX,"" we carefully reason our proposition that a new discovery in Neuroscience will give an edge to the earliest adopters in the development community. We seek the brightest developers and content producers - those who strive for new features to give them a deciding edge.  A</span><span>nd, those  who will read and grasp the fundamental discoveries that open a new market opportunity - <em>Gold Mine for development.</em></span></p>
<p><span>                              Now for just this time on Indiegogo, a few early adopter Developers can use our headphone and SDK as a test module and easily experiment and build gaming and mobile apps with a powerful new medium for programing neuromodulaton: producing peak experiences  and new highs for consummers of all media content - movies, TV, games and handheld devices. We anxiously wonder:<strong><em> What ""Dark Arts"" will the programming Wizards conjure up next ? </em></strong></span></p>

<h2><span><strong>                                       Inside NULYX</strong></span></h2>
<p><span><strong>                           Earliest Discoveries.</strong> NULYX has emerged from years of research in Neuroscience in Canada and Europe. Its heritage can be traced to Tesla,"" the first hacker,"" who first pioneered the patterning of energy as waveforms for transmission.  <strong>Today, NULYX patterns signals and sends them via Bluetooth from a Smartphone app to a special conductor chip in a headset to create the NULYX special effect. (See: Our Science.)</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>                           Neuromodulation with Music. </strong>Listening to music is among the most rewarding human experiences. Peak responses with music can range from the measurable equivalent of eating a pleasurable meal up to that of psychoactive drugs.  Music can arouse feelings of euphoria and can be accompanied by ""chills"" which are now also measurable as an experience.</span></p>
<p><span>                        <strong>   New Research.</strong> Recently, music heard through a headphone was traced conclusively to show release of  the neurotransmitter Dopamine.  Intense peak pleasure was measured as chills sensations as follows:</span></p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/546687/files/20121120021550-Screen_Shot_2012-11-09_at_10.13.56_PM.png?1353406550"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Published Research: quantifying Dopamine release while wearing a headphone and listening to music.<a href=""http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/14960986/1761327716/name/dopamina+e+m%C3%BAsica.PDF%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span> See Full Research Article</span></a> ;  and, <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007487"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>See Full Research Article</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>                           Energizing the Story or Song. </strong>Writers and composers have long known how to program peak emotions using the narrative form. We see this in it's simplest two-step form above, comprising: (1) anticipation; and, (2) release or dramatic resolution accompanied by neurotransmitter release. We see this same effect of peak emotional high again when our team finally wins The Series or Superbowl with many smaller highs preceding the finale. NULYX is additive and layered on top of present content to amplify its intensity using a weak pulsed magnetic waveform like adding caffeine with alchohol to stimultate neurotransmitter dopamine release.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>                           NULYX Engineers Emotional Experience.</strong> Remarkably, emotional immersion can be engineered by neuromodulation and <strong>added</strong> or <strong>stacked</strong> as numerous studies show. <strong>NULYX tracks the unfolding of music or story and then is added to amplify emotional effect. </strong></span></p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/546690/files/20121120021754-IMG_9576.JPG?1353406674"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span><strong>                           Peak Experieces in Music.</strong> Listen on You Tube to the Finale of the William Tell Overture, the rousing Hallelujah Chorus, The Ride of the Valkyre, or America the Beautiful to feel how this time course of neurostimulation plays out in the composition.</span></p>
<p><span>                      <strong>   <em>  Or,</em> in Everyday Life. </strong>The success of Facebook and Twitter rest, in part, on neuromodulation.  Neuroscientists at Harvard have just shown their secret.  Brain imaging has revealed that social media derive much of its success by providing a vehicle for self-disclosure which occupies 30- 40% of our daily speech. Here, disclosure stimulates measurable surges in dopamine release. See: <a href=""http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtamir/Tamir-PNAS-2012.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Full Research (Self-Disclosure Harvard) Article.</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>                           A Fundamental Discovery. </strong>Prescription medication, coffee, music - just about any stimulus can trigger neurostimulation. In addition to music, both ultrasound and magnetic waveforms can also be programmed with narrative media for neuromodulation. This provides a big opprotunity for content development. The operant mechanism in the pivotal role of neurotransmitter Dopamine as a reward and progenitor signaling molecule in all of the above is now believed to influence the release of tiny amounts of natural morphine by white blood cells for the pleasurable rewarding response. And intriquingly for content developers, morphine is known for being the most euphoric of medications.</span></p>
<p><span>                          An interesting correlation with these findings can be made between the repeated administration of magnetic fields in numerous studies and pain relief. In just one tentative study cited immediately below, a weak and pulsed magnetic waveform was administered using a headset for pain relief wherein it was observed to be equivalent in it's effectiveness to that of prescription Morphine.  For how this works, see: ""Endogenous Morphine: Up-to Date Review 2011"" by Stefano and Kream,  <a href=""http://fb.cuni.cz/file/5635/FB2012A0008.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Full Research (Endogenous Morphine) Article</span></a>.

<p><span><strong>                           BLUETOOTH: <em> HEADPHONE NEWS FOR DEVELOPERS</em> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>                          Bluetooth Trumps VR.  </strong>Bluetooth is about to release a wide variety of specifications for synchronization of economical 3D entertainment applications including theatres, TV, and display devices of all kinds.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>                          Bluetooth 3D.  </strong>Foremost for 3D TV will be stereo headphones deployed with Bluetooth to increase immersion. Headphones are combined with 3D Bluetooth glasses using the new Bluetooth 3D Synchronization Protocol. Argueably,<em> a far more practical and mass-market solution for total immersion than present Virtual Reality.</em> Special Bluetooth 3D glasses and Bluetooth high quality stereo will be streamed and synchronized with 3D display and stereo headphones to create emotional immersion for an an amazing experience, as depicted below:</span></p>

<p><span><strong>                          Bluetooth Dual View for Gamers.</strong> For game developers, the revolutionary Bluetooth Dual View interactive system allows two players to have two different views on the same display ---  just like in real life combat. Our NULYX developers will immediately get all the Bluetooth details on these and other applications long before hardware release.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>                          Bluetooth Integration with NULYX. </strong>The NULYX Headphone connects by Bluetooth to the IPhone or Android device automatically. All smartphones now have Bluetooth as does 60% of new TV. The total of Bluetooth enabled devices is at 2+ BILLION a year and rapidly growing - opening vast opportunities for apps arising from this accelerating interoperability.  </span></p>
<p><span><strong>                          Bluetooth Enables New Headphone Applications. </strong> For example, who wants to read Email when your headphone can do it for you with Bluetooth; while driving, running, biking, or busy in the kitchen.  For developers, Bluetooth is a recognizable brand and has become a valuable resource in the consumer decision making process.

<h2><span><strong>                    Developer Headphone Test Modules: </strong></span></h2>
<p><span><strong>                          Our First Audience is Developers : those who want to create applications for big markets. With the NULYX System Development Kit (SDK), the imaginations of Wizards will run wild. Imagine being able to amp music, games and handheld apps to a new level of intensity.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>                          And,</strong> <strong>beginning in June 2013</strong>, we plan to host Skype international hackathons -  just like Facebook does -  to bring together our then new community of hacker and developer contributors together in a  12 hour game-like application environment to experiment and build new apps with NULYX.</span></p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/546696/files/20121120022359-IMG_2557.JPG?1353407039"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span><strong>                            Development Possibilities are Endless.</strong> Combining our  licensed and registered  SDK with our headphones makes a test module ( perk tiers 3 and 4 ). It's all you need for designing, testing and studying  neuromodulation for entire packages of content. Or, try NULYX with weight - loss workouts where hundreds of apps, sensors and devices support the fitness industry and need more intensity. Apps with NULYX will seem  to make tedious routines to pass by more swiftly. Routines with NULYX combined with music will give you wings! For examples of present workout apps see: <a href=""http://wahoofitness.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>wahoofitness.com</span></a>. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>                             Programming Is Easy.</strong> Waveforms can be <em>graphically </em>configured into patterns like objects, then into strings and finally pulse trains using the NULYX SDK and our simple drawing tool that manipulates straight lines for constructing waveforms from your laptop or PC. Waveforms can be copyrighted the same as Music.</span></p>
<p><span>                            <strong> Programming Waveforms. </strong>The NULYX configuration tool for drawing  is one of our favorite aspects of the Project. For example, here's one way to break down a basic waveform into its constituent parts for configuration. Like composing music, patterns of these waveforms can then be synchronized with the content to intensify the broad arc of the story or song for more exhilarating experiences.  </span></p>

<h2><span><strong>                     Market Opportunity for Developers:</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span><strong>                      <em>                 -- It's all in the Arithmetic. </em></strong></span></h3>
<p><span><strong>                            Why Develop NULYX apps? Application development is about being in the right place at the right time. History shows that only the earliest adopters in app development can seize the low hanging fruit. If you could turn the clock back, what app theme would you develop? Today, with nearly a million apps it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish new offerings in a crowded  marketplace. Increasingly, only new features (pixie dust) can give you an edge.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>                      <strong>     Headsets .</strong>For application developers, headphones are presently a $2 Billion market worldwide ( $1.2 Billion US). This market is broad and deep, estimated to be 20X larger than for the Smartwatch.  Increasingly, headphones have become a place to get away to - your own private retreat. Also, they are now combined with other devices and technologies like gaming, Skype, computers, tablets and TV.  </span></p>
<p><span>                           <strong>A Captive Audience.</strong> The linkage and interoperability between the smartphone and headphone via Bluetooth holds audience attention. Now, visualize games, music, distant learning, self-help and the entire world of content-- all made more intense with greater audience attention provided with the combination of NULYX and a headphone..

<p><span><strong><br/></strong></span><span>                           <strong>Deeper into Nulyx</strong>. It was Dr. Aaron Seitz at the University of California who for us first identified weak magnetic fields as stimulating neurotransmiter release and causing measurable effects below conscious perception. He observed that these fields could potentiate ""organized and meaningful improvement of discriminative performance,""( as, in gaming ) <em>and that</em>, ""magnetic stimulation could boost signals to surpass learning thresholds,"" (as, in Internet and Distance Learning).  See: <a href=""http://faculty.ucr.edu/~aseitz/pubs/SeitzDinse07.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Full Article.</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br/><strong>                           Published Headset Research.</strong> The first published research using a headset occurred in Canada in 2007. This effect was described in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using a pulsed low frequency waveform from a magnetic field. What has become NULYX was first observed as an artefact in Medicine in MRI imaging and was seen again in pain and depression relief. Initially, it was tested using a headset for pain relief in a published  comparative study against prescription oral pain relievers of  the opioid morphine, oxycodone and codeine class. Morphine is generally considered the most euphoric of pain relievers.

Analysis, subsequent re-analysis and correlation of the data from 407 subjects, confirmed the effect. Most significantly, subjects described their experiences as,"" personally very meaningful,<strong> richer, more emotional and real."" </strong> See Published Research on 19 studies: International Journal of Neuroscience 116: 1079-1096,2006: See: <a href=""http://www.laurentienne.ca/NR/rdonlyres/54878F0B-BBDD-4119-AD45-497E5B298FD4/0/StPierre_Persinger_2006.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Full Article.</span></a></span></p>

                              More Than a Headphone: A New Way to Listen. Here, you can experience the NULYX special effect in an advanced headphone: a perk for our Contributors.  The goal of the NULYX project on Indiegogo is to raise awareness for a new fundamental discovery in Science and to build a commercial product from this finding from our working models and fund our production run.  By supporting our debut and manufacturing roll-out  -  you'll be first to get your hands on an amazing instrument. 
                                                    
                   Part 2 - for Developers, a New Gold Rush 
                             Our First Audience is Developers of Content.  Here and in Part 1 - ""Inside NULYX,"" we carefully reason our proposition that a new discovery in Neuroscience will give an edge to the earliest adopters in the development community. We seek the brightest developers and content producers - those who strive for new features to give them a deciding edge.  And, those  who will read and grasp the fundamental discoveries that open a new market opportunity - Gold Mine for development.
                              Now for just this time on Indiegogo, a few early adopter Developers can use our headphone and SDK as a test module and easily experiment and build gaming and mobile apps with a powerful new medium for programing neuromodulaton: producing peak experiences  and new highs for consummers of all media content - movies, TV, games and handheld devices. We anxiously wonder: What ""Dark Arts"" will the programming Wizards conjure up next ?

                                       Inside NULYX
                           Earliest Discoveries. NULYX has emerged from years of research in Neuroscience in Canada and Europe. Its heritage can be traced to Tesla,"" the first hacker,"" who first pioneered the patterning of energy as waveforms for transmission.  Today, NULYX patterns signals and sends them via Bluetooth from a Smartphone app to a special conductor chip in a headset to create the NULYX special effect. (See: Our Science.)
                           Neuromodulation with Music. Listening to music is among the most rewarding human experiences. Peak responses with music can range from the measurable equivalent of eating a pleasurable meal up to that of psychoactive drugs.  Music can arouse feelings of euphoria and can be accompanied by ""chills"" which are now also measurable as an experience.
                           New Research. Recently, music heard through a headphone was traced conclusively to show release of  the neurotransmitter Dopamine.  Intense peak pleasure was measured as chills sensations as follows:
 
Published Research: quantifying Dopamine release while wearing a headphone and listening to music. See Full Research Article ;  and, See Full Research Article.
                           Energizing the Story or Song. Writers and composers have long known how to program peak emotions using the narrative form. We see this in it's simplest two-step form above, comprising: (1) anticipation; and, (2) release or dramatic resolution accompanied by neurotransmitter release. We see this same effect of peak emotional high again when our team finally wins The Series or Superbowl with many smaller highs preceding the finale. NULYX is additive and layered on top of present content to amplify its intensity using a weak pulsed magnetic waveform like adding caffeine with alchohol to stimultate neurotransmitter dopamine release.
                           NULYX Engineers Emotional Experience. Remarkably, emotional immersion can be engineered by neuromodulation and added or stacked as numerous studies show. NULYX tracks the unfolding of music or story and then is added to amplify emotional effect. 
 
                           Peak Experieces in Music. Listen on You Tube to the Finale of the William Tell Overture, the rousing Hallelujah Chorus, The Ride of the Valkyre, or America the Beautiful to feel how this time course of neurostimulation plays out in the composition.
                           Or, in Everyday Life. The success of Facebook and Twitter rest, in part, on neuromodulation.  Neuroscientists at Harvard have just shown their secret.  Brain imaging has revealed that social media derive much of its success by providing a vehicle for self-disclosure which occupies 30- 40% of our daily speech. Here, disclosure stimulates measurable surges in dopamine release. See: Full Research (Self-Disclosure Harvard) Article.
                           A Fundamental Discovery. Prescription medication, coffee, music - just about any stimulus can trigger neurostimulation. In addition to music, both ultrasound and magnetic waveforms can also be programmed with narrative media for neuromodulation. This provides a big opprotunity for content development. The operant mechanism in the pivotal role of neurotransmitter Dopamine as a reward and progenitor signaling molecule in all of the above is now believed to influence the release of tiny amounts of natural morphine by white blood cells for the pleasurable rewarding response. And intriquingly for content developers, morphine is known for being the most euphoric of medications.
                          An interesting correlation with these findings can be made between the repeated administration of magnetic fields in numerous studies and pain relief. In just one tentative study cited immediately below, a weak and pulsed magnetic waveform was administered using a headset for pain relief wherein it was observed to be equivalent in it's effectiveness to that of prescription Morphine.  For how this works, see: ""Endogenous Morphine: Up-to Date Review 2011"" by Stefano and Kream,  Full Research (Endogenous Morphine) Article. And also See: Full Research (Pain Management) Article using a headset. For more discussion see Our Science.
                                            PART 2 
                          A New Medium for Developers
                                         BLUETOOTH: a Two - Way Radio on a Chip:                              
 
                           BLUETOOTH:  HEADPHONE NEWS FOR DEVELOPERS 
                          Bluetooth Trumps VR.  Bluetooth is about to release a wide variety of specifications for synchronization of economical 3D entertainment applications including theatres, TV, and display devices of all kinds.
                          Bluetooth 3D.  Foremost for 3D TV will be stereo headphones deployed with Bluetooth to increase immersion. Headphones are combined with 3D Bluetooth glasses using the new Bluetooth 3D Synchronization Protocol. Argueably, a far more practical and mass-market solution for total immersion than present Virtual Reality. Special Bluetooth 3D glasses and Bluetooth high quality stereo will be streamed and synchronized with 3D display and stereo headphones to create emotional immersion for an an amazing experience, as depicted below:
 
                          Bluetooth Dual View for Gamers. For game developers, the revolutionary Bluetooth Dual View interactive system allows two players to have two different views on the same display ---  just like in real life combat. Our NULYX developers will immediately get all the Bluetooth details on these and other applications long before hardware release.
                          Bluetooth Integration with NULYX. The NULYX Headphone connects by Bluetooth to the IPhone or Android device automatically. All smartphones now have Bluetooth as does 60% of new TV. The total of Bluetooth enabled devices is at 2+ BILLION a year and rapidly growing - opening vast opportunities for apps arising from this accelerating interoperability.  
                          Bluetooth Enables New Headphone Applications.  For example, who wants to read Email when your headphone can do it for you with Bluetooth; while driving, running, biking, or busy in the kitchen.  For developers, Bluetooth is a recognizable brand and has become a valuable resource in the consumer decision making process. See: Video 1 and Video 2.

                    Developer Headphone Test Modules: 
                          Our First Audience is Developers : those who want to create applications for big markets. With the NULYX System Development Kit (SDK), the imaginations of Wizards will run wild. Imagine being able to amp music, games and handheld apps to a new level of intensity.
                          And, beginning in June 2013, we plan to host Skype international hackathons -  just like Facebook does -  to bring together our then new community of hacker and developer contributors together in a  12 hour game-like application environment to experiment and build new apps with NULYX.
 
                            Development Possibilities are Endless. Combining our  licensed and registered  SDK with our headphones makes a test module ( perk tiers 3 and 4 ). It's all you need for designing, testing and studying  neuromodulation for entire packages of content. Or, try NULYX with weight - loss workouts where hundreds of apps, sensors and devices support the fitness industry and need more intensity. Apps with NULYX will seem  to make tedious routines to pass by more swiftly. Routines with NULYX combined with music will give you wings! For examples of present workout apps see: wahoofitness.com. 
                    
                             Programming Is Easy. Waveforms can be graphically configured into patterns like objects, then into strings and finally pulse trains using the NULYX SDK and our simple drawing tool that manipulates straight lines for constructing waveforms from your laptop or PC. Waveforms can be copyrighted the same as Music.
                             Programming Waveforms. The NULYX configuration tool for drawing  is one of our favorite aspects of the Project. For example, here's one way to break down a basic waveform into its constituent parts for configuration. Like composing music, patterns of these waveforms can then be synchronized with the content to intensify the broad arc of the story or song for more exhilarating experiences.  
  
                     Market Opportunity for Developers:
                                       -- It's all in the Arithmetic. 
                            Why Develop NULYX apps? Application development is about being in the right place at the right time. History shows that only the earliest adopters in app development can seize the low hanging fruit. If you could turn the clock back, what app theme would you develop? Today, with nearly a million apps it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish new offerings in a crowded  marketplace. Increasingly, only new features (pixie dust) can give you an edge.
                           Headsets .For application developers, headphones are presently a $2 Billion market worldwide ( $1.2 Billion US). This market is broad and deep, estimated to be 20X larger than for the Smartwatch.  Increasingly, headphones have become a place to get away to - your own private retreat. Also, they are now combined with other devices and technologies like gaming, Skype, computers, tablets and TV.  
                           A Captive Audience. The linkage and interoperability between the smartphone and headphone via Bluetooth holds audience attention. Now, visualize games, music, distant learning, self-help and the entire world of content-- all made more intense with greater audience attention provided with the combination of NULYX and a headphone.. See: Full Research (Learning) Article. See: Full Research (Video Game) Article. 
       
                         Specific Gaming and Education Applications. Intriguingly, development opportunities exist for gaming applications to stimulate Dopamine  and other neurotransmitters to improved visual processing, speed reflexes and  cognitive processing as US Army now studies show. Result:  WIN MORE OFTEN---the Ultimate Secret Weapon. For Learning, Dopamine stimulation enhances memory and speed of recall, replacing study drugs and without the later letdown. Result: BETTER GRADES. 
Additional applications for Developers identified with neurotransmission described below can be found in the NULYX published research archive in the Tier 4 - ""Mad Scientist"" Perk:  
 
We are working with the best researchers and techs in the industry -
 
SPECIAL THANKS: To Distinguished Professor, Dwight Streit, Ph.D and his staff at the UCLA Engineering Institute of Technology Advancement for their support which helped us answer some key questions. ( Link: See Letter.) Thanks also to staff at the Behavoral Neuroscience Laboratory, Laurentian University in Canada and to its Director, Dr. Michael A Persinger, and especially to its Chief Technology Officer Stanley Koren,and to Alex W. Thomas, Ph.D at Western Ontario University and the Lawson Research Institute staff which was patient and helpful.
Furthermore, special thanks are particularly owed to: Aaron R. Seitz, Ph.D,. UC Riverside. Doctor Seitz’s pioneering work in perception provided the basis and overarching theory for the application by NULYX of a way to make entertainment richer and more immersive. 
Thanks too, to the chief technology officers: Richard Kulavick ( Turtle Beach-gaming headphones ), Tony DiChiro ( Monster Products mfg.of Beats by Dr.Dre ), Ed Woodard (Grado Labs), Dr.Testuro Oishi (Skullcandy), Dan Gauger (Bose Corporation, co-inventor of Noise Cancellation) and special thanks to Walt Husak (Dolby Labs), Sean Cooney ( Warner Bros VP, Advanced Technology), Roberto Padovani (Qualcomm  EVP and former CTO), and Faroog Hameed ( Broadcom - Bluetooth ).  And, there are nameless others involved but, they could get fired if we told who they are.
 
                                 Part 3: Our Science
                           Deeper into Nulyx. It was Dr. Aaron Seitz at the University of California who for us first identified weak magnetic fields as stimulating neurotransmiter release and causing measurable effects below conscious perception. He observed that these fields could potentiate ""organized and meaningful improvement of discriminative performance,""( as, in gaming ) and that, ""magnetic stimulation could boost signals to surpass learning thresholds,"" (as, in Internet and Distance Learning).  See: Full Article.
                           Published Headset Research. The first published research using a headset occurred in Canada in 2007. This effect was described in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using a pulsed low frequency waveform from a magnetic field. What has become NULYX was first observed as an artefact in Medicine in MRI imaging and was seen again in pain and depression relief. Initially, it was tested using a headset for pain relief in a published  comparative study against prescription oral pain relievers of  the opioid morphine, oxycodone and codeine class. Morphine is generally considered the most euphoric of pain relievers. See Published Research on this Headset Effect: See: Full Article.
                           Neurostimulation. A pleasant neurostimulative, even euphoric effect, was consistently observed again at another Canadian University.  There, pleasant effects and even transcendent experiences had been facilitated using a headpiece in 19 published experiments spanning a number of years. Analysis, subsequent re-analysis and correlation of the data from 407 subjects, confirmed the effect. Most significantly, subjects described their experiences as,"" personally very meaningful, richer, more emotional and real.""  See Published Research on 19 studies: International Journal of Neuroscience 116: 1079-1096,2006: See: Full Article.

Pairing Experimentation with NULYX Headphones:

                          Sharing Feelings. Feelings appear to have been conveyed silently in the laboratory between subjects by converting single words representing a feeling recorded digitally for transmission as a natural weak magnetic waveform.  In addition to music creating sonic energy, the electronics in all headphones create a weak magnetic field which could convey single word information to the mind. (Words used in the experiments were like "" marvelous,"" "" happy,"" "" giving,"" ""comfortable,""'and "" beautiful."").                        
 The implications of these tentative findings are potentially significant - a phenomenon that has been reproduced and published twice. It could be fun -  an intriguing experiment with a special friend!  Applications exist for use by gamers in combination with Bluetooth Dual View.                         
All those who purchase two or more NULYX  headphones will receive instructions on how to set up these experiments. See reward tier 4. See Full Article.

The name means more, it means We ALL have addictions, but We decided to do something Saintly instead. Turn a Negative into a Positive. Be Positive. Be A Saint.</p>
<p>I started SA's in my mind, before leaving America for 4 years of World Travel, this Idea hit me like lightning, and almost made me NOT Travel. I Launched as soon as I landed a year ago in Las Vegas Sept. 2012. I have been working Local Events consistently, on the weekly, with Great Success and Community Support, ever since. I am Originally from Las Vegas, Proud to say that I am, and that's why I called it, ""The Las Vegas Original."" I have worked at Sales, Marketing, and Networking for my whole LIFE, built a database of 5,000 Local LIFE Time Customers (LTC's), all before I stepped a foot out of Vegas.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to own my own business, and this business had to reach People, a lot of People, People World Wide. The business had to make a difference in Peoples LIVES, NOT just profits, but something We ALL could share and grow Together. So, I took a chance at LIFE, packed everything I owned in a storage unit, and Traveled the World. I sold my car, sold my condo, and proceeded into the World with one Idea: Tattoo T-Shirts. The idea is simple, but struck me like lightning: Tattoo's are REALLY Popular, they are also ART, and any tattoo design could be printed on a T-Shirt. People have a HUGE Passion for their tattoo's, and everywhere I LIVED in the World, my Local Friends owned Tattoo Shops, but didn't sell apparel. Could I be so lucky to find a business niche, as to start an International Company, that NOT only made shirts, but distributed them World Wide. That my Friends and I could express Our Creativity, Our Originality, Share Our Positivity, and We would Change this World Together. That We would let the World decide what design would come to fruition, print those chosen shirts as needed, and NOT be left with over-stock. With this Network, we would NEVER have to discount a garment, but simply give it extra LOVE, and send that garment to another profitable location. We would be United, Ideas would be Shared, and We ALL would give back to ALL Our Local Communities. </p>
<p>Be the Change you want to see in the World. - Mahatma Gandhi </p>
<p>On My Journey, the world provided the fact that all my Friends abroad owned Tattoo Shops, but didn't sell their designs, or any apparel. They say to be a Millionaire, you must take a Millionaire to lunch, so I did. Here's what she told me: Buy Wholesale, mark up your apparel 5 times, and sell through creative Marketing. Sure, this is easy information, and definitely NOT worth the lunch money, but I Learned. I took that knowledge with me as I Traveled, visiting factories in China, Turkey, and Thailand, with this idea in my head, and trying to find a way to bring it to reality. </p>
<p>What I found was that I have a lot of Friends, Local and around the World, who were hungry to sell apparel, make their own apparel, and needed help to distribute said apparel. We ALL have businesses, full of Talent and Ambition, but without working capital. There was plenty of designs, many tattoo shops that wanted to join, but no money to, ""Make it Happen' Captain'!!!"" So, I decided to Unite Us ALL, Create a Network were designs, apparel, and ideas flowed Universally, and We would ALL Grow simultaneously. We are starting a company like the World has NEVER seen. A business based on Co-Sharing; The concept is simple, but Strong: An Idea that if We ALL work Together, sharing ALL the Knowledge, Ideas, and Solutions Together - We will Grow Together. Within Our TEAM - We will Grow Faster and Stronger Together. By doing so, We NOT only maximize Our Growth and Profits, but We will Create a platform with the most original designs, fastest distribution, and make a difference in Our Local Communities. </p>
<p>With new technology in Logistics and Analytics, We can Grow a business that covers the World, Connects the World, and Unites Us as a Family. The way technology intended. Now our Cultures, ART, and Ideas get shared rapidly, without fear of competition, but in the Spirit, that if one of Us makes it, We ALL make it.</p>
<p>As ONE or NOT at ALL</p>
<p>We just need one design, one phrase, or one trademark to become a Global Success, and we ALL benefit from the groups efforts. We feel confident that Our Global Network, will cover a wider range of possible customers, increasing our chances for higher sales revenue, and bringing more Connectivity to Our small planet. Our ultimate GOAL is to reach People, from ALL walks of LIFE, through shirts, because everyone wears shirts. That is just the beginning, the shirts get Our foot in the door, once the door is open, We can Share Our Ideas, We can then spread the Philosophy of Co-Sharing, People can join Our Network, and the World will have a Global Group doing something Positive for the betterment of Our Human Species.</p>
<p>Knowledge is Power - Words have Power - We want that Power to go to the People. </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We need working capital, the moneys contributed will go directly to growing this business. Step one is getting everything legal, business licenses, tax ID numbers, and DBA's. We need contracts made to sign new Artists, before We launch their designs or brands. We need a multi-lingual website, that will need social media software, and search engine optimization. We need to buy more apparel to fulfill orders, and to manufacture more shirts. We want to create a successful website, before a single brick is put into place, establishing ourselves in the local Community. </p>
<p>All of the above has been done through my own personal funds, every cent goes to Events. ALL the Networking, the social media, and gathering the troops has been done. The social media is primed and ready for take off, we have created a 1,000 People Like Page, and looking to expand ten fold to that. We are regulars at weekly Events in Las Vegas, every First Friday is filled with Friends and possible customers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need: </p>
<p>$500 dollars to get ALL of Our Business Licenses complete.</p>
<p>$1,000 dollars to finish and Launch Our New Website by November 5th.</p>
<p>$750 dollars to do the Las Vegas Bike Festival again, October 3rd-6th.</p>
<p>$2,500 dollars to re-supply Our shrinking inventory, approximately 500 pieces.</p>
<p>$6,000 dollars to Travel back to Finland, Turkey, and Thailand ($2,000 each) and secure supply lines and sign contracts with Our World Wide Partners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Total - $10,000 in Start-Up Cost</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$50,000 to go International - Honk Kong and Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>$100,000 to build ""The Coolest T-Shirt Shop in Las Vegas""</p>
<p>$250,000 to Launch Saints Brand Internationally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The business plan has been re-written, the financials have been tightened, and now we have come to a point were additional funds are needed to move forward and grow to Our FULL capacity. An attorney needs to make contracts, our CPA needs to balance the books, and we need to replenish our supplies for back-orders.</p>
<p>Even if We don't reach Our entire GOAL, as you can see above, every little bit will Help. We already make the most of what We have. We will still have to get legal, We still will vend at more Events, and the website is ready to Launch on November 5th. </p>
<p>If you Help Us reach this GOAL on Time, NOT only will You receive a hand shake and a HUG, an outpouring of acknowledgement, but a FREE T-Shirt.</p>

That it is possible for the first time in history where Artists help their Local Community through ART, and in return for their ART, We will distribute their ART to different Countries.

The name means more, it means We ALL have addictions, but We decided to do something Saintly instead. Turn a Negative into a Positive. Be Positive. Be A Saint.
I started SA's in my mind, before leaving America for 4 years of World Travel, this Idea hit me like lightning, and almost made me NOT Travel. I Launched as soon as I landed a year ago in Las Vegas Sept. 2012. I have been working Local Events consistently, on the weekly, with Great Success and Community Support, ever since. I am Originally from Las Vegas, Proud to say that I am, and that's why I called it, ""The Las Vegas Original."" I have worked at Sales, Marketing, and Networking for my whole LIFE, built a database of 5,000 Local LIFE Time Customers (LTC's), all before I stepped a foot out of Vegas.
I have always wanted to own my own business, and this business had to reach People, a lot of People, People World Wide. The business had to make a difference in Peoples LIVES, NOT just profits, but something We ALL could share and grow Together. So, I took a chance at LIFE, packed everything I owned in a storage unit, and Traveled the World. I sold my car, sold my condo, and proceeded into the World with one Idea: Tattoo T-Shirts. The idea is simple, but struck me like lightning: Tattoo's are REALLY Popular, they are also ART, and any tattoo design could be printed on a T-Shirt. People have a HUGE Passion for their tattoo's, and everywhere I LIVED in the World, my Local Friends owned Tattoo Shops, but didn't sell apparel. Could I be so lucky to find a business niche, as to start an International Company, that NOT only made shirts, but distributed them World Wide. That my Friends and I could express Our Creativity, Our Originality, Share Our Positivity, and We would Change this World Together. That We would let the World decide what design would come to fruition, print those chosen shirts as needed, and NOT be left with over-stock. With this Network, we would NEVER have to discount a garment, but simply give it extra LOVE, and send that garment to another profitable location. We would be United, Ideas would be Shared, and We ALL would give back to ALL Our Local Communities. 
Be the Change you want to see in the World. - Mahatma Gandhi 
On My Journey, the world provided the fact that all my Friends abroad owned Tattoo Shops, but didn't sell their designs, or any apparel. They say to be a Millionaire, you must take a Millionaire to lunch, so I did. Here's what she told me: Buy Wholesale, mark up your apparel 5 times, and sell through creative Marketing. Sure, this is easy information, and definitely NOT worth the lunch money, but I Learned. I took that knowledge with me as I Traveled, visiting factories in China, Turkey, and Thailand, with this idea in my head, and trying to find a way to bring it to reality. 
What I found was that I have a lot of Friends, Local and around the World, who were hungry to sell apparel, make their own apparel, and needed help to distribute said apparel. We ALL have businesses, full of Talent and Ambition, but without working capital. There was plenty of designs, many tattoo shops that wanted to join, but no money to, ""Make it Happen' Captain'!!!"" So, I decided to Unite Us ALL, Create a Network were designs, apparel, and ideas flowed Universally, and We would ALL Grow simultaneously. We are starting a company like the World has NEVER seen. A business based on Co-Sharing; The concept is simple, but Strong: An Idea that if We ALL work Together, sharing ALL the Knowledge, Ideas, and Solutions Together - We will Grow Together. Within Our TEAM - We will Grow Faster and Stronger Together. By doing so, We NOT only maximize Our Growth and Profits, but We will Create a platform with the most original designs, fastest distribution, and make a difference in Our Local Communities. 
With new technology in Logistics and Analytics, We can Grow a business that covers the World, Connects the World, and Unites Us as a Family. The way technology intended. Now our Cultures, ART, and Ideas get shared rapidly, without fear of competition, but in the Spirit, that if one of Us makes it, We ALL make it.
As ONE or NOT at ALL
We just need one design, one phrase, or one trademark to become a Global Success, and we ALL benefit from the groups efforts. We feel confident that Our Global Network, will cover a wider range of possible customers, increasing our chances for higher sales revenue, and bringing more Connectivity to Our small planet. Our ultimate GOAL is to reach People, from ALL walks of LIFE, through shirts, because everyone wears shirts. That is just the beginning, the shirts get Our foot in the door, once the door is open, We can Share Our Ideas, We can then spread the Philosophy of Co-Sharing, People can join Our Network, and the World will have a Global Group doing something Positive for the betterment of Our Human Species.
Knowledge is Power - Words have Power - We want that Power to go to the People.

<p>Hi! I’m Amelia, owner and head designer of my self-titled label, Amelia Walsh. Right now I am a one-man show in creating my collections, and I do so straight out of my home in Phoenix, Arizona. All products are made as sustainable and environmentally friendly as possible using natural fibers, eco-friendly materials or deadstock fabrics whenever they are available. </p>

<div><b>What are CuffloCs?</b></div>
<div>CuffloCs are cufflinks that are glass lockets (Cufflinks + Locket = CuffloCs) that can be unscrewed and changed for any occasion.  They are approximately the size of a nickel and constructed out of stainless steel.  The screw/on off design keeps your items securely inside the double sided glass and can easily be taken apart to change the design.  They are the perfect gift to give or receive and can be customized to make the perfect accessory. </div>

</div>
<div>I recently got married and looked for months for the perfect groomsman gifts.  I was still looking up to the very last moment trying to find the most unique and useful items.  Besides something unique, I wanted something personalized... well I couldn't find or have both.  All personalized items were unoriginal and were mainly some type of drinkware.  I eventually settled on personalized tuxedo flasks, hence why I was still buying items on the day of our rehearsal.  Everyone loved the flasks as well as the other misc items I got, but I still wanted better and more.  I've always been a fan of cufflinks and a more fitting occasion than a wedding to show them off.  However I couldn't justify spending $50 or even $100 on a pair of personalized cufflinks that the guys would wear for one night.  So maybe I won't put the date and just get initials I thought, but initials were too plain for my taste and again I looked for more. The bottom line there wasn't anything else so I thought why not make something?  And that's how CuffloCs were born.  CuffloCs are not just for wedding gifts.  Being able to change the charms or even put your own picture in them makes them the only pair of cufflinks you need.  You can create your own unique piece to match any outfit (coming from someone who owns too many sneakers cause they have to match) and any occasion (think anniversary, birthday, retirement, holidays/father's day, vacations, etc).  It's time men wear a unique piece a jewelry and one our counterparts can't/don't wear.  Still not sold on CuffloCs? Watch how easy it is to make an original accessory...</div>

<p><b>Wearable tech glass that you see the world the best way- your way.</b> We know what you’re thinking. Wearable tech glasses were revealed to the market a couple years ago by a big name company and, well, let’s just say it the product didn’t soar. So, why even bother with this product? The answer is simple. We can do it better and make it way more affordable. We believe MAD Gaze can ease and amplify everyday life. This generation needs a product that uses the world’s most advanced technology to not only make lives more convenient, but also enhanced. Our young, energetic group worked passionately to create an easy-to-use, stimulating product that transforms <b>traditional 2D graphics into an exciting 3D experience.</b></p>
<h1><b>What Exactly Is MAD Gaze?</b></h1>
<p>MAD Gaze is a line of smart glass that runs on Android mobile operating system. <b>It has ALL the functions- and MORE- of a smart phone.</b> This state-of-the-art, exclusive wearable tech makes you feel in control of all your surroundings. </p>

<figcaption>4 Major Functions of MAD Gaze</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<ul><li>
<b>Instant Translation</b> - Ever walk around a foreign country and have no idea what is going on? MAD Gaze is going to fix that for you. There is an auto-translate application that translate everything the glass see into the language of your choice. You’ll never want to travel without your MAD Gaze. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Social</b> - MAD Gaze allows users to make phone calls, text, send multimedia to contacts, access personal data assistant (PDA) and play any media. Seeing as this is the main reason people are on their smart phones all the time, by replacing that phone with MAD Gaze, a lot more time will be spent looking up. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Entertainment &amp; Games</b> - Imagine playing your favorite game not having to look down at the screen, or using AR+ to play games where your surrounding real world interacts with you. Suddenly, the game becomes more interactive than idle. The world is enriched. MAD Gaze takes gaming to a whole new, more exciting and entertaining level. As a player, you truly feel in game. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>GPS Navigation</b> - The GPS on MAD Gaze will ensure you never get lost. With the map and directions right in front of you, you will no longer miss a turn. A completely hands-free map creates a safer alternative than a smartphone in situations where having your hand free is quite important. Just envision having a little map in the corner of your eye directing you as you bike, drive, walk, run, kayak, anything! </li></ul>

<h1><b>What Is Augmented Reality? </b></h1>
<p>AR+ is a live direct or indirect view of physical, real-world environments who elements are augmented by a computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics, or GPS data. Basically, it makes your surrounding world digital and interactive. When you are using MAD Gaze and look at a specific object, the device uses AR+ to display texts, images, audios, videos and 3D animations on the screen.</p>

MAD Gaze


Wearable tech glass that you see the world the best way- your way. We know what you’re thinking. Wearable tech glasses were revealed to the market a couple years ago by a big name company and, well, let’s just say it the product didn’t soar. So, why even bother with this product? The answer is simple. We can do it better and make it way more affordable. We believe MAD Gaze can ease and amplify everyday life. This generation needs a product that uses the world’s most advanced technology to not only make lives more convenient, but also enhanced. Our young, energetic group worked passionately to create an easy-to-use, stimulating product that transforms traditional 2D graphics into an exciting 3D experience.
What Exactly Is MAD Gaze?
MAD Gaze is a line of smart glass that runs on Android mobile operating system. It has ALL the functions- and MORE- of a smart phone. This state-of-the-art, exclusive wearable tech makes you feel in control of all your surroundings. 



MAD Gaze is more than just an Android phone!


Using Augmented Reality technology (AR+), the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digital. It is operated by multi-touch and voice control with high recognition by motion and voice sensors embedded. Leaving your hands free to handle the millions of other things you have to do. MAD Gaze gives you a reason to keep your head up.
What Does MAD Gaze Do?
Our product is truly AMAZING! The following functions are what truly believe make it pop. In reality, though, the potential with MAD Gaze is infinite.


4 Major Functions of MAD Gaze



Instant Translation - Ever walk around a foreign country and have no idea what is going on? MAD Gaze is going to fix that for you. There is an auto-translate application that translate everything the glass see into the language of your choice. You’ll never want to travel without your MAD Gaze. 

Social - MAD Gaze allows users to make phone calls, text, send multimedia to contacts, access personal data assistant (PDA) and play any media. Seeing as this is the main reason people are on their smart phones all the time, by replacing that phone with MAD Gaze, a lot more time will be spent looking up. 

Entertainment & Games - Imagine playing your favorite game not having to look down at the screen, or using AR+ to play games where your surrounding real world interacts with you. Suddenly, the game becomes more interactive than idle. The world is enriched. MAD Gaze takes gaming to a whole new, more exciting and entertaining level. As a player, you truly feel in game. 

GPS Navigation - The GPS on MAD Gaze will ensure you never get lost. With the map and directions right in front of you, you will no longer miss a turn. A completely hands-free map creates a safer alternative than a smartphone in situations where having your hand free is quite important. Just envision having a little map in the corner of your eye directing you as you bike, drive, walk, run, kayak, anything! 



4 Major Functions: Social, GPS Navigation, Instant Translation, Entertainment & Games (from left to right)These are just a few examples of what MAD Gaze can do. In fact, MAD Gaze is more than that. It can also take photos or record videos with the camera, web browse with broadband internet, use Wi-Fi, and run third party applications. The possibilities are endless. Literally imagine anything you can do with a smart phone and now imagine doing that with your head up and your hands completely free. That’s MAD Gaze!

What Does MAD Gaze Look Like?
MAD Gaze will come with glasses for every purchaser to use. We want as many people as possible to be able to use MAD Gaze , regardless of their style. For that reason, we have made it so you can disconnect the dock of MAD Gaze and reconnect it to most other glasses. The product will be available in silver, titanium and rose gold.



MADDY (Silver)





TITAN (Titanium)





ROSA (Rose Gold)


What Is Augmented Reality? 
AR+ is a live direct or indirect view of physical, real-world environments who elements are augmented by a computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics, or GPS data. Basically, it makes your surrounding world digital and interactive. When you are using MAD Gaze and look at a specific object, the device uses AR+ to display texts, images, audios, videos and 3D animations on the screen.



Example of Augmented Reality apps developed by Dragon Creative


Is It Easy To Use? YES! We've Developed AR+ Cloud For YOU.
AR+ may sound somewhat complicated, but MAD Gaze makes in easy to incorporate into your everyday life. In fact, making your own AR+ application is as easy as managing Facebook. 



We have created an AR+ application generating platform, AR+ Cloud on  >> arcloud.madgaze.com/en/ which requires NO technical knowledge. You can make an AR+ app for anything you can think up. MAD Gaze can truly enhance all aspects of your life that you can imagine.
Where To Get The Apps For MAD Gaze?
No worries. We have thought about it and planned it and created MAD Store, an online platform specifically for MAD Gaze users to download apps from there. 
Everything You Need At One Spot
There will be variety of apps on MAD Store.You can simply scan the QR codes to download app to your MAD Gaze . Of course, developers can share their good work on MAD Store at >>store.madgaze.com

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Close to 8.1 million underprivileged children in India are out of school and into child labor in order to earn a single meal in a day. Their family income is less than $2 a day. There is no food security and mortality rate is very high. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In an under construction building, where we were planning to take an office, we asked a 5 year old who was helping his mother carry bricks, if he wanted to go to school – his answer was simple and hits the nail on its head – I would love to go to school and play with other children and toys, but who will give me food?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">When basics in life are not secure, priorities for these children are not the same as you and me. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This campaign is about raising funds to secure food for 550 under privileged children.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/101955/files/20130929042958-why-food.jpg?1380454198"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is our belief, if we secure food for these underprivileged children, we can get them to school. We are helping underprivileged children by providing them with a healthy, balanced meal that they would otherwise have to work for. The meal is an incentive for them to continue their education and go to school. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">If these children get educated, their quality of life can be different. They can start dreaming of a better life again and work towards it. Instead of being on the streets, begging, doing drugs, stealing, and becoming marginalized by society - they can be active contributors to society.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Today, their only dream is getting one meal a day. At times when their parents do not get work as they are daily wage laborers, they have to make do with just water.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It takes roughly $15 (or 4c per day) to feed a child for a year. A coffee a day at $1.85 costs $675 annually!! </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">With this campaign we aim to raise $100,000 and use the profits (expected at $8,000) we generate towards securing food and nutrition for 550 underprivileged children. This means we will be able to get these children to go to school and off the streets as meals become an incentive for them to be regular at school.</span></p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">With our 16 hrs a day jobs, there was hardly any time for any other activity. Giving back to the community and working towards helping underprivileged children was always at the back of our minds, but we never got an opportunity and the time. Sounds like an excuse, but that is the reality for most of us.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The incident at the construction site in Nov 2012 changed all that. We quit our jobs and started building what we feel will help us contribute better to this cause. We have pledged a part of our profits every year towards this goal. This year we aim to ensure food for 1,500 under privileged children. Next year our target is to ensure food for 3,000 under privileged children.</p>

A special prize for referring most amount of funders and helping to raise most amount of contributions! The prizes will include the wallet starter packages and a trophy for the person referring the most amount of funders, with an inscription and your name!

Close to 8.1 million underprivileged children in India are out of school and into child labor in order to earn a single meal in a day. Their family income is less than $2 a day. There is no food security and mortality rate is very high. 
In an under construction building, where we were planning to take an office, we asked a 5 year old who was helping his mother carry bricks, if he wanted to go to school – his answer was simple and hits the nail on its head – I would love to go to school and play with other children and toys, but who will give me food?
When basics in life are not secure, priorities for these children are not the same as you and me. 
This campaign is about raising funds to secure food for 550 under privileged children.



It is our belief, if we secure food for these underprivileged children, we can get them to school. We are helping underprivileged children by providing them with a healthy, balanced meal that they would otherwise have to work for. The meal is an incentive for them to continue their education and go to school. 
If these children get educated, their quality of life can be different. They can start dreaming of a better life again and work towards it. Instead of being on the streets, begging, doing drugs, stealing, and becoming marginalized by society - they can be active contributors to society.
Today, their only dream is getting one meal a day. At times when their parents do not get work as they are daily wage laborers, they have to make do with just water.




It takes roughly $15 (or 4c per day) to feed a child for a year. A coffee a day at $1.85 costs $675 annually!! 






With this campaign we aim to raise $100,000 and use the profits (expected at $8,000) we generate towards securing food and nutrition for 550 underprivileged children. This means we will be able to get these children to go to school and off the streets as meals become an incentive for them to be regular at school.




We are professionals, who left their corporate jobs to start Yaasna Fusion Jewelry & Accessories that designs and retails sterling silver gemstone jewelry and leather accessories. Please visit www.yaasna.com to see our products. 
With our 16 hrs a day jobs, there was hardly any time for any other activity. Giving back to the community and working towards helping underprivileged children was always at the back of our minds, but we never got an opportunity and the time. Sounds like an excuse, but that is the reality for most of us.
The incident at the construction site in Nov 2012 changed all that. We quit our jobs and started building what we feel will help us contribute better to this cause. We have pledged a part of our profits every year towards this goal. This year we aim to ensure food for 1,500 under privileged children. Next year our target is to ensure food for 3,000 under privileged children.



We need your help in ensuring we achieve our goal of raising $100,000 with this campaign to make sure we are able to sponsor 550 children. It does not cost much – just the cost of a few cups of coffee!

As our heartfelt gratitude for your help in achieving this goal we are giving the following perks –

Before making the schlep from Westchester to Syracuse for my freshman year of college, I had only heard rumors of how brutal the winters would be. Once the temperatures dropped, the snow piled up, and the vodka hot chocolate just wouldn't keep me warm anymore, I knew I had to resort to another method of raising my body heat. Time had come to get creative...
Though looking good while staying warm was the inspiration, being comfortable in whatever I wore was always a top priority. Rather than throwing on an old hoodie, I wanted to look put together and fashionable...and I wanted to feel that way in whatever I was wearing. I decided to design wraps that fit women of all shapes and sizes, and just like the 'go-to' LBD (little black dress), these wraps were meant to be a staple in every woman's closet. Versatility played an important role in the creation of my line...


...and my 20 years of experience as a fashionista didn't hurt either.

To my surprise, I soon found myself surrounded by girls in Just Jamie Scarves all around campus.
After graduating, I did the responsible thing and took a typical 9 to 5 job behind a desk. But something was missing. I needed to give the gift of warmth that I had spread so graciously throughout my college years.

Marginalized communities of negativity, fatherless children, gun violence, and substance abuse. If anyone faced adversity in their life, she has.   Through out the years, she's learned to overcome almost impossible circumstances, and tragedy. In spite of obstacles Althea has won awards from all over Toronto for her business plans and ideas: Recognition from Microskills Canda, City of Toronto, Spider Jones, and Humber College.  For years Althea has worked in the social community field working with youth and children programs.  She is well recognized for her hard work and commitment in the lives of many.  Being inspired, she decided to change her career from working with children to Multi Media Design. Graduating as an overachiever in June 2012,  Althea thought entering the work force the second time would have been easier. However, in the past year and a half she’s been out of work and faced with even more hardship.   Althea faced eviction notices, which threatened her residency. She starred at homelessness many times.  Luckily, she had people around her who helped her with her rent and food. With no money, barely anything to eat she would cry herself to sleep some nights. Wondering when will the struggle be over.  It seemed as if no matter how hard she tried, and how much she proved herself, nothing would break.  Mid 2013, Althea laid in her bed hungry, and frustrated.  Suddenly her heart grew fond a great idea that would change so many lives…She combined her experience working with children and youth, a desire to be a great entrepreneur, and her recent situation of going without decent meals, into one plan...To build a company that would share a message of hope by providing meals for those who need it most. Somehow, everything she went through began to all tie together.  She began to think about her situation, and the millions children around the world that have no help.  Althea’s belief is she was meant to go through struggle for a time as this. To relate to others, and be an effective business leader… Not only making profit, but more importantly making a difference in the world.  She realized she had what it took to be a successful business leader. But what she needed was for the public to see her vision, and ideas…Talking to some of her professors at Humber College, they encouraged her that this business idea was great for Indiegogo. So, she took this new social innovation business idea to the next level…. Now on Indiegogo... is the beginning of Tees That Feed.http://mediaservices.humber.ca/awards12/awards12-MSIT.htmlhttp://www.humber.ca/vpacademic/content/testimonialshttp://www.microskills.ca/spider-jones-youth-leadership-award-recipients/What We Need & What You Get

Here's my story.</strong></p><p>I am the loving father of three children and i have been married for 15 years. I've been wanting to do this project for a long time and so i am asking you, the Indiegogo community, to fund to the Bald Brothers and Bald Sisters project. Keep in mind, if the Bald Brothers and Bald Sisters  project meets its goal and continues to be succesful, donations will be made to wounded soldiers fighting for our country.</p><p><strong><em>How it happened.</em></strong> </p><p>I got inspired to make the Bald Brothers and Bald Sisters cartoons when my eldest daughter and I were spending some time together when I heard her cry. I looked back and saw that she was in pain. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she hurt her hand. Nothing i did seemed to cheer her up until i got the idea of drawing faces on her fingers. She started giggling immediately and that's when the idea came to me.</p><p><strong><em>Where we're up to.</em></strong> </p><p>I did a 44 second commercial / motion picture just so I can bring these characters to life. As a small Company I am starting from the bottom  by doing merchandise first. I created a few car air fresheners and they came up beautifully, so this time I want to hit the beach with this gorgeous product... Flip flops, and lovely cartoons for all ages. This cartoon is made for males and females alike. The faces on the Bald Brothers characters show a variety of emotions. I wanted to give them unique character traits by having them show different facial features. From the big brother to the little one, and from the smart brother, to the slow one, each character has an original personality.

<p>How often do you find yourself in need of a website template, a photo, a graphic, a plugin, an audio or a video file for your project?</p>
<p>How often do you end up paying for one of these?</p>
<p>Wouldn't you agree that some things in life should be more accessible and free?</p>
<p>This is what we believed when we started creaTTor a year ago.</p>
<p>We embarked on a mission and invested our own time and money in developing a platform that will bring together creative people driven by the same vision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.creattor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""creaTTor"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flashxml.net/creattor/creattor-display.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h1><img alt=""Where we are now"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flashxml.net/creattor/where.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h1>
<p>We have already created a fast and reliable platform with a complex architecture that is capable of hosting and displaying multiple types of assets, each with different attributes and characteristics.</p>
<p>We have gathered together more than 100 ""creattors"" and over 5,000 free assets.</p>
<p>We developed a fast assets browsing tool with flexible category selection which will show the most relevant and popular files according to selected categories, search queries and filters.</p>
<p>We created a user accounts system and an admin interface to manage all the aspects of user uploads, file and account details.</p>
<p>Take a look around at <a href=""http://www.creattor.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #118bdd;"" target=""_blank"">www.creattor.com</a> and see what we currently have to offer. </p>
<p>Then imagine it taken to the next level ...</p>
<h1><img alt=""What is your money going toward?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flashxml.net/creattor/what.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h1>
<p>We need $200,000 to fund a creative team that will make creaTTor and its assets simply stunning.</p>
<p>We will add new creative categories to creaTTor, including: stock photos, audio &amp; video loops and templates, code snippets, plugins and modules for mobile devices and Wordpress and other CMS's.</p>
<p>We will hire world class designers and developers to create awesome material that we will share for free for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>We will advertise on relevant websites to raise awareness, to persuade and motivate people to submit and share their creations for free.</p>
<p>We will launch creative contests.</p>
<p>We will create a blog with news regarding each creative industry and with a discussion forum.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal, upon completion, is to have a platform where you can't tell the difference between creaTTor's most popular free assets, and the premium assets offered for sale by other established creative websites, in relation to the general style and quality of content.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><img alt=""Who will do all these"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flashxml.net/creattor/who.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h1>
<p>We're <a href=""http://www.flashxml.net/our-team.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #118bdd;"" target=""_blank"">a team</a> of creative people who love design and technology. Each member may have different hobbies and unique skill sets, but everyone shares the same love.</p>
<p>In the past, we created <a href=""http://www.flashxml.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #118bdd;"" target=""_blank"">www.FlashXML.net</a>  and the most popular and flexible Flash components on the web, made in-house, when Flash was the main platform available for creating interactive web content.</p>
<p>We designed and created multiple websites, templates, plugins, graphic and video content. Most of our team members have extensive experience in the online industry, and many have also worked for major IT companies.</p>

<h1><img alt=""Management and timeline"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flashxml.net/creattor/management.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h1>
<p>As with any project involving team work, management is the key to success.</p>
<p>Clear targets will be set and each of our team members will be focused on one or two particular tasks.</p>
<p>Our main numeric goal will be to create, bring and approve at least 100 new assets on creaTTor each day.</p>
<img alt=""Timeline"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flashxml.net/creattor/timeline.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p>The quality is more important than numbers and we will concentrate on what we like best: creating beautiful content.</p>
<p>We will keep you posted on our blog with the evolution of our project each step of the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><img alt=""Challanges and approaches"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flashxml.net/creattor/challanges.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h1>
<p>The most common question asked by professional web designers and developers is how would a website offering content created without a monetization goal could keep up with similar commercial websites in terms of quality, complexity and diversity?</p>
<p>Well, the first part of this achievement will result from this campaign. With the funds collected we will ensure that the quality of the uploaded content will be amongst the highest available.</p>
<p>Secondly, once creaTTor reaches a certain level of popularity, we are confident we will find resources to keep a world class team engaged in this continuously creative process, bringing fresh content to the website and adding innovative minds to our team on a regular basis.</p>
<p>This commitment comes from the fact that, as a team, we are the <a href=""http://www.flashxml.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #118bdd;"" target=""_blank"">all time top-selling producers</a> of Flash components. Our team will have surpassed, not only in sales and popularity, but also in complexity and quality of content other authors from websites with a more diverse content. This simply goes to show that a well-organized team can deliver better results in a highly competitive industry.</p>
<p>And, most importantly, we will be backed by an open community. Amazing things happen when people from all over the world work together.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><img alt=""Copyright issues"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flashxml.net/creattor/copyright.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h1>
<p>We take copyright infringement seriously, allowing only original and properly licensed work to be uploaded to our website. We will display and respect any license terms and distribution rights of each and every individual author.</p>
<p>Most of the files on creaTTor are under a <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #118bdd;"">creative commons</a> license which basically means they are all free for personal and many times commercial use.</p>

<p></p></span></div>","How often do you find yourself in need of a website template, a photo, a graphic, a plugin, an audio or a video file for your project?
How often do you end up paying for one of these?
Wouldn't you agree that some things in life should be more accessible and free?
This is what we believed when we started creaTTor a year ago.
We embarked on a mission and invested our own time and money in developing a platform that will bring together creative people driven by the same vision.
 

 

We have already created a fast and reliable platform with a complex architecture that is capable of hosting and displaying multiple types of assets, each with different attributes and characteristics.
We have gathered together more than 100 ""creattors"" and over 5,000 free assets.
We developed a fast assets browsing tool with flexible category selection which will show the most relevant and popular files according to selected categories, search queries and filters.
We created a user accounts system and an admin interface to manage all the aspects of user uploads, file and account details.
Take a look around at www.creattor.com and see what we currently have to offer. 
Then imagine it taken to the next level ...

We need $200,000 to fund a creative team that will make creaTTor and its assets simply stunning.
We will add new creative categories to creaTTor, including: stock photos, audio & video loops and templates, code snippets, plugins and modules for mobile devices and Wordpress and other CMS's.
We will hire world class designers and developers to create awesome material that we will share for free for everyone to enjoy.
We will advertise on relevant websites to raise awareness, to persuade and motivate people to submit and share their creations for free.
We will launch creative contests.
We will create a blog with news regarding each creative industry and with a discussion forum.
Our ultimate goal, upon completion, is to have a platform where you can't tell the difference between creaTTor's most popular free assets, and the premium assets offered for sale by other established creative websites, in relation to the general style and quality of content.
 

We're a team of creative people who love design and technology. Each member may have different hobbies and unique skill sets, but everyone shares the same love.
In the past, we created www.FlashXML.net  and the most popular and flexible Flash components on the web, made in-house, when Flash was the main platform available for creating interactive web content.
We designed and created multiple websites, templates, plugins, graphic and video content. Most of our team members have extensive experience in the online industry, and many have also worked for major IT companies.
 

 

As with any project involving team work, management is the key to success.
Clear targets will be set and each of our team members will be focused on one or two particular tasks.
Our main numeric goal will be to create, bring and approve at least 100 new assets on creaTTor each day.
The quality is more important than numbers and we will concentrate on what we like best: creating beautiful content.
We will keep you posted on our blog with the evolution of our project each step of the way.
 

The most common question asked by professional web designers and developers is how would a website offering content created without a monetization goal could keep up with similar commercial websites in terms of quality, complexity and diversity?
Well, the first part of this achievement will result from this campaign. With the funds collected we will ensure that the quality of the uploaded content will be amongst the highest available.
Secondly, once creaTTor reaches a certain level of popularity, we are confident we will find resources to keep a world class team engaged in this continuously creative process, bringing fresh content to the website and adding innovative minds to our team on a regular basis.
This commitment comes from the fact that, as a team, we are the all time top-selling producers of Flash components. Our team will have surpassed, not only in sales and popularity, but also in complexity and quality of content other authors from websites with a more diverse content. This simply goes to show that a well-organized team can deliver better results in a highly competitive industry.
And, most importantly, we will be backed by an open community. Amazing things happen when people from all over the world work together.
 

We take copyright infringement seriously, allowing only original and properly licensed work to be uploaded to our website. We will display and respect any license terms and distribution rights of each and every individual author.
Most of the files on creaTTor are under a creative commons license which basically means they are all free for personal and many times commercial use.
Everything our team creates will be MIT licensed, which is the most permissible open source license out there. It means you can do whatever you want and choose whatever license you want when you build something with our files.

In short, depending on your level of financial contribution, the following perks may be available to you:
1. Licenses for FlashXML products (www.flashxml.net)2. Badges next to your name on creaTTor site3. Exposure for your name and/or brand on creaTTor4.

<p>Hello, my name is TJ Byerson. I
am a 25 year old man from New York City currently living in Baltimore,
Maryland. While I am new to this form of fundraising, I am excited to share
with you a little bit about myself and what I am doing.</p>
<p>As a member of Alpha Phi Alpha
Fraternity, Incorporated, I have come to learn the pride in representing an
organization that means so much to me as it does to my fellow fraternity
brothers as well as the men and women of other Black Greek-Lettered
Organizations through paraphernalia (shirts, hats, sweaters, etc.). However,
many of the looks of the apparel available didn’t always appeal to my personal
sense of style. After discussing my frustration with fellow fraternity and
sorority members, I learned I wasn’t alone. It was from that a spark occurred
within me. Why couldn’t there be apparel that has both mass appeal as well as
fit into the Greek life niche?</p>
<p>It is from that spark that
Unconquerable Soul was born. A line that serves both Greeks and non-Greeks alike. I am taking the leap and putting my hat in the
ring to provide a unique take on apparel. But this idea born into a brand is
still in its infancy, and is for that reason that I am asking for the support
of those who believe in me, my idea and my passion. Helping me launch this
effort will allow me to see this effort through to the end, make a difference
and most importantly, demonstrate that chasing dreams are possible when you’ve
got drive, ambition and support.</p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Hailing from the west coast of Canada, in the rainy city of Vancouver, our story began with the ambition to develop the smallest, most portable everyday umbrella while retaining strength. Ideally, a product small enough to fit in a jacket pocket, yet sturdy enough to last season after season. However, this proved to be more troublesome than we imagined. Umbrellas haven’t really changed at all for the past century. The mechanisms still remain the same in how they’re built and how they operate. There were tweaks here and there, whether changing the profile of the members or changing the materials to improve size and strength. After countless weeks of trying to design a smaller umbrella to compete with others, we started realizing why small umbrellas were all constructed the same: every shortcut is taken to reduce that final size and weight. If we were to compromise strength for size, it would be yet another product with a short life span. So we decided that while we can’t make the smallest umbrella, we can most definitely make the strongest and most durable umbrella.<br/>

<div>We listed every feature that we liked amongst current umbrellas and everything we would want in ours. Working out of the <a href=""https://hackspace.ca/wp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vancouver Hack Space</a>, we had to redesign almost every component. Going back to basic engineering principles and leveraging new innovative processes, we defined we a new architecture, new mechanisms and improved product life. In the end, aside from making the strongest umbrella, we believe we have created the most versatile umbrella. An umbrella with a fully telescopic architecture, interchangeable canvas capability, an Independent Suspension System and finally a drip-free concealed handle enclosure.<br/>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As we optimize the assembly for production, there will likely be some minor changes. The Cypress Umbrella is a well-defined and working prototype, but there's more to perfect. Improvements are planned for the handle, enclosure and top hub components to improve aesthetic appeal and make it even more user-friendly. The Cypress Umbrella is currently compromised largely of 3D printed parts alongside our precision machined components. These 3D printed parts will translate into production intent materials and manufacturing processes. Just imagine how strong the umbrella will become when our 3D printed parts are constructed from aluminum and injection molded plastic! All changes will only be of benefit to you, and of course we will always keep you informed of any modifications and advancements.</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING: Together, we have over 15 years of experience in the automotive sector dealing with suppliers and manufacturing. We will only be working with suppliers with experience in providing high quality components ensuring your Cypress Umbrella is built to last.</p>
<p>FULFILLMENT: We will do our best to meet our delivery goals. As this product is so new and unique, there is a high chance that we'll encounter obstacles along our way. However, we can ensure you that we will not take shortcuts or accept poor quality components while creating your Cypress Umbrella. So please be patient with us as we bring you the last (and best) umbrella that you will ever buy!</p>

We listed every feature that we liked amongst current umbrellas and everything we would want in ours. Working out of the Vancouver Hack Space, we had to redesign almost every component. Going back to basic engineering principles and leveraging new innovative processes, we defined we a new architecture, new mechanisms and improved product life. In the end, aside from making the strongest umbrella, we believe we have created the most versatile umbrella. An umbrella with a fully telescopic architecture, interchangeable canvas capability, an Independent Suspension System and finally a drip-free concealed handle enclosure.




The past 10 months has been an endless cycle of design ? fabricate ? test ? break ? repeat. The result is the refined prototype you see now. Our goal in the next 10 months is to make sure the umbrella is in your hands.






Cahay Ho, born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, is a Mechanical Engineering graduate out of the University of Alberta. Throughout his studies, Cahay was heavily involved with the Formula SAE race car, the experience that sparked the idea behind the Cypress Umbrella’s Independent Suspension System. In the workplace, he is a product design engineer, constantly creating innovative solutions across multiple sectors from automotive to biomedical. 
Kevin Truong, from Toronto, Ontario, is a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Waterloo. A natural problem solver, Kevin’s jack-of-all-trades skill set is especially useful during time-critical situations. He brings a wealth of experience from automotive and aerospace sectors through his work for GM and Daimler as well as multiple Tier 1 suppliers.

Risks and challenges
PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As we optimize the assembly for production, there will likely be some minor changes. The Cypress Umbrella is a well-defined and working prototype, but there's more to perfect. Improvements are planned for the handle, enclosure and top hub components to improve aesthetic appeal and make it even more user-friendly. The Cypress Umbrella is currently compromised largely of 3D printed parts alongside our precision machined components. These 3D printed parts will translate into production intent materials and manufacturing processes. Just imagine how strong the umbrella will become when our 3D printed parts are constructed from aluminum and injection molded plastic! All changes will only be of benefit to you, and of course we will always keep you informed of any modifications and advancements.
MANUFACTURING: Together, we have over 15 years of experience in the automotive sector dealing with suppliers and manufacturing. We will only be working with suppliers with experience in providing high quality components ensuring your Cypress Umbrella is built to last.
FULFILLMENT: We will do our best to meet our delivery goals. As this product is so new and unique, there is a high chance that we'll encounter obstacles along our way. However, we can ensure you that we will not take shortcuts or accept poor quality components while creating your Cypress Umbrella. So please be patient with us as we bring you the last (and best) umbrella that you will ever buy!",28.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p> We've been developing Georgie over the past year and a half. It began with our search for the perfect active wear fabric that will wick moisture to keep us cool, have the right amount of stretch allowing us to move freely and still look fashionable and stylish.</p>
<p> After we sourced our fabric, we started working with local pattern and sample makers with over 30 years of industry experience, and ultimately we teamed with a production facility in Austin, TX that are known for their high level of detail and craftsmanship. We are proud to work with a local factory and offer you beautiful dresses and skirts that are made in the USA.</p>

<p>Georgie Wear was launched in 2014 as a collaboration between two artists, athletes and life long friends, Danielle Hatch and Meikel Reece. Our love of sports began in school as co-captains of our high school volleyball team. Danielle went on to study architecture and sculpture, where her background in sewing came in handy as she created a 10' tall Victorian dress for her masters thesis at UC-Santa Barbara. Meikel studied photography and established her freelance photography business, while also working in the fashion industry as a buyer and  retail manager. </p>
<p>As we both transitioned into our careers in the arts and motherhood, we found ourselves, like so many women, spending the entire day in our workout clothes. We loved the comfort and ease of these clothes but didn't always feel fashionable going out to dinner in our yoga pants and running shorts. Georgie Wear was inspired by our desire to bridge the divide between our active wear and casual wear. We wanted to create athletic inspired pieces that can take you quickly from your workout to the rest of your day without wasting time or sacrificing style. </p>

<h3>About the hemisphere lamps</h3>
<p>Dear Contributors, thank you for your interest and for reading these lines.</p>
<p>I started this project because I moved to a new flat and wanted to buy lamps for the rooms. After running to several shops I can tell you: lamps are really expensive. So I decided to make a lamp myself. You can see the prototype in the picture above.</p>
<p>It would be great for me to help other people who don't have enough money to buy expensive lamps, with their lighting situations. In my online shop (read about it later) you can decide which color each lamp should be and so you can get a unique designed piece at a low price.</p>
<p>Please help me to bring some light into the world!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you can see this is only a prototype to prove that it's not a fake. I need some more things to make those lamps more professional and to sell them to everyone in the world.</p>
<p>First of all I need some good tools like a professional milling machine (like this one: <a href=""http://img4web.com/view/XSLJK2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://img4web.com/view/XSLJK2</a>), a workbench, tools for painting, and other tools. Then I need better materials (silicon coated wires, better sockets for the lamps, ...).</p>
<p>With these tools and materials I can produce the lamps and sell them to my customers. For doing that I need a website with a shop - I'm no web designer and I need someone who sets it up for me.</p>
<p>That's why I need those funds and I hope I can reach my goal.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>
<p>Just tell your family, classmates, friends, husband, wife,... about my campaign. :-)</p>

<h1>Hi there, Indiegogo!</h1>
<p>I'm Zihao, and along with my friend Rob we are working on bringing wooden sunglasses to you this summer, through our project <strong>Canopy Sunglasses</strong>!</p>
<p>Not only are we trying to do something different in the world of sunglasses, we're also doing our bit for the planet by planting a tree for every pair that we ship. </p>
<p>We've already made a handful of prototypes and are looking for funding to ramp up production. We would be honoured if you would be part of our journey.</p>

<h1>Something different</h1>
<p>So what are we talking about when we say ""something different""? Surely there's enough variety in the market already?</p>
<p>Not sure if you know, but the global sunglasses industry is largely under the control of one company. <strong>Luxottica</strong>.</p>
<p>These guys are <strong>EVERYWHERE</strong>. They own <strong>Ray-Ban, Persol, Oakley, Oliver Peoples </strong>and <strong>Vogue</strong>, just to name a few. They are also the guys that make the sunglasses branded under <strong>Armani, Bulgari, Chanel, D&amp;G, DKNY, Ralph Lauren, Prada, Versace</strong> - you name it! In addition to all these brands, they also own <strong>Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, ICON, Cole Vision Care</strong> among a whole host of other subsidiaries. All this made them more than seven billion Euros in 2012. <strong>More than seven billion</strong>.</p>
<p>So essentially you've got a single company offering you ""choice"" between its ""competing"" brands. All that's happened is the prices have gone up and up. <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704518904575365362932852610.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Find out more.</a></p>
<p>With Canopies we're trying to break the mould. Rob and I are just two guys in London who are trying to make a bit of a splash. With us, you get a pair of exquisite hand-made wooden sunglasses that features a unique wooden grain, with none of the brand inflation to pay for the glossy billboard advertising. </p>

<p>With this Indiegogo project we're trying to launch our first line of Canopies. We're keeping it simple right now. Two classic styles in a number of different types of wood for you to choose from. The lenses are also premium polarising lenses that offer full UV protection. Each pair is hand made and inspected to ensure quality is top notch. We've been wearing them for a while now and genuinely love them.  If this goes well, we've got many ideas up our sleeves for future models!

<p>We built Canopy with more in mind than just cool summer styles. We're convinced that responsible businesses can do a lot of good in the wider community, too. Desertification is one of the biggest challenges facing the planet today. We're not experts on the topic, but <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Allan Savory is</a>. With every pair of Canopies you buy, you're not only supporting responsibly-sourced wood production, but also contributing to the fight against desertification.</p>
<p>For each pair of Canopies, we will be planting a tree in the Koulikoro region of Mali - an area that faces increasing desertification, terrible soil erosion and destruction of animal habitats. The trees planted not only reforest the area, they also act as windbreaks which protect fields and fights soil erosion.</p>
