<h2>Why Haiti Needs Moringa Trees</h2>
<p>Haiti has the highest risk of climate disaster of any country in the world, largely due to deforestation. International development agencies have spent billions of dollars to reforest Haiti but the trees are often cut down to use as cooking fuel. 70% of Haitians live off less than $2 dollars a day. Haiti also has the highest rate of malnutrition of any country in the Western Hemisphere. Moringa thrives in Haiti's dry climate and is incredibly nutritious, making moringa trees the ideal solution to help battle deforestation and malnutrition in Haiti. By launching Moringa Green Energy Shots in the US, Kuli Kuli and the Smallholder Farmers Alliance will provide hundreds of Haitian moringa farmers with a sustainable income. This will ensure farmers will protect the trees and have access to nutritious moringa leaves. </p>

They going to scrape down to her muscle and some of her bone. A Slow and PAINFUL recovery is her reality now... She and her family cannot afford to hire any outside help, let alone pay the already discounted cost of the surgery and the supplies she'll need monthly to care for her wound.What We Need & What You GetThe generous surgeons understand Jennifer's financial situation and have dropped the cost of her surgery from upwards of $20,000 to a reasonable $7,000. This generous discount is still too much out-of-pocket for Jennifer's family. In addition to the initial cost of the surgery Jennifer needs Private Home Care Assistance for a minimum of 18 months.Surgery - $7,000Supplies like gauze, sterile soaking fluid, bandages, etc. - $600 per monthHousekeeper / Living Assistace - $15,000-22,000+Jennifer needs more than 2-3 hours of help a day, but she is going to take what she can get. I had originally calculated a 2 hour a day plan, and then decided to calculate a 3 hours a day schedule (after I'd made the video) for her to hire care at $15 an hour (which is on the low end of what qualified people charge) because even 3 is barely enough... Basically it'd be:$15 per hour for 3 hours a day, 7 days a week for 18 months... or$15 per hour for 2 hours a day, 7 days a week for 18 months...Which adds up to our TOTAL GOAL of: $30,000+After fees to pay inidiegogo and Paypal the total raised if we meet our goal will be around $3,000 lower once it gets to Jennifer. So, our goal is not going to cover all of her costs but it will make it possible to get care for at least a year or so... We're totally being modest and understating how enormous of a financial burden this is going to be for her.>>For every donation you will get the satisfaction of knowing you contributed to Jennifer's healing journey and well-being. She needs all the support she can get right now. Anything you can give will help her family out, and lessen the burden. With donations of $25 or more you can receive various perks including: free eBooks (written by Jennifer), a private Spiritual Aromatherapy Consultation or Tarot/Oracle card reading, a mention in one of Jennifer's blog posts for your business or organization, and/or a ad space on Jennifer's very popular blog (http://www.hybridrastamama.com)Jennifer's Physical LimitationsNo sitting, squatting, bending, lifting, etc... How does one do this and still take care of her daughter and home...? (I don't know.) She needs more than 3 hours of help a day! She needs so much help... I cannot emphasize enough how challenging this is going to be (and already is) for Jennifer. She struggles every day not having hired help. She needs your donations urgently!The ImpactJennifer helps other people every single day. She goes way beyond the average blogger and pours her heart into every well-researched post or valuable project she embarks upon. She has created a community of health-minded people surrounding her blog and Facebook page, and is well-loved and appreciated for her contributions that she does for free. The least we can do is give back to her now in her crisis. Your donations, positive thoughts, and help spreading this campaign will allow Jennifer to heal faster and continue to write articles that help thousands of people improve their health. You can make a huge difference in the lives of many by helping Jennifer.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can’t donate, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Kristian is an Honor student going into the 11th grade. He is a drummer in marching band which placed first in state for their division and is in concert band. Kristian is a great kid, always studying at school and helping other kids with their school work. Kristian is always aiming for A's in all his classes especially his honor classes. Kristian hopes to become a lawyer one day and is starting his studies early. Kristian was about to begin a police academy training camp for a week when we discovered his hernia. He is supposed to attend scout camp in July and then band camp for two weeks.</p>
<p>Kristian has an Indirect Inguinal Hernia. The surgeon hopes to be able to stitch the problem rather than inserting mesh that will last with Kristian the rest of his life. We are hopeful too.</p>
<p>This surgery will put him out the rest of his summer holidays and of course put a hold on his police training camp. He has worked so hard we would hate for him to miss all the activities he works so hard to be a part of.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The funds raised will go directly to the insurance costs (about $5,000), and after surgery care.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, any funds we do raise will still go towards the bills.</p>

<p>The story I am about to tell you doesn’t evoke happiness, but rather about getting some financial relief to fight a brutal disease named Leukemia, which has started a battle of it’s own inside my cousin Annie’s body.</p>
<p>Annie Wagner is 17 years of age. She has Down Syndrome. Annie has a Brother named Lawrence Wagner who served in Iraq. Shortly after her brother came back from duty Annie was diagnosed with Bilineal Leukemia in February 2012.</p>

<p>Annie’s Father Joseph works very hard to take care of his family. Annie’s Mother (Amy Wagner), takes care of Annie at home. Annie’s Leukemia is rare because of her Down Syndrome and her age as a teen. After Annie’s first round of Chemo she contracted Metapontum ( the common cold virus) that almost took Annie’s life in April 2012.</p>
<p><img alt=""Annie and her brother"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Owxj0.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>Annie has since responded to the Chemo Treatments and is now in remissionm but still has two long years of Chemo treatments to come.</p>
<p>What Annie has is called <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17611554"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bilineal Leukemia </a>which is a rare disease with a poor outcome because she has Downs Syndrome, and on top of that, she is just a teenager. After Annie's chemo treatments, she contracted what is known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapneumovirus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Meta Pneumo</a>. </p>
<p>What is Leukemia? In simple terms, Leukemia is cancer of the blood cells. It starts in the bone marrow; the soft tissue inside most bones and bone marrow is where blood cells are made. Over time, leukemia cells can crowd out the normal blood cells. This can lead to serious problems such as anemia, bleeding, and infections. Leukemia cells can also spread to the lymph nodes or other organs and cause swelling or pain. In other words, this is something that needs to be treated on a daily basis to ease the pain of this disease.</p>
<p>We want Annie to experience life as all of us reading this have, and pull-through the treatment with unlimited support and determination. She has an amazing and supportive family who are by her side 24/7, and now we are looking at any size donation to put towards an amazing cause… that cause is the gift of life.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise just $1800 for my cousin Annie. Just something to ease the pain of high medical bills and to keep the life saving treatments going.

<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Hi.</p></span><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></p></span><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></p>
<p>I'm Dr. Debra Solomon. Based on my own personal experience and need, I've created an effective, fashionable, non-medical solution to hot flashes and night sweats. It's so simple, effective, and life-changing that I want to share it with the world of women--and the men who share their challenges!!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/156453/files/20131026185615-Deb_Open_reduced.jpg?1382838975"" src="""" style=""width: 358.19px; height: 420px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> Having experienced hot flashes and night sweats myself, I can tell you--they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Uncomfortable</p></li>
<li><p>Unpredictable </p></li>
<li><p>Distracting</p></li>
<li><p>Distressing </p></li>
<li><p>Disruptive </p></li>
<li><p>and potentially Debilitating.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I needed to get past my temperature regulation issues to be at my best for my patients, my family, and my community and I know that there are millions of other women--and men and couples--with temperature issues who could experience life-changing benefits from our temperature regulating garments and bedding products too.  </p>
<p><strong>Beyond making and selling products that work</strong>, we're looking at being game changers in the health/wellness world and in fashion.  We're done with the top down approach of the fashion industry and the medical world. We want to create a non-standard shopping experience in which our customers will be our consultants, our models, and our sales force--and share in the rewards of our success.  In addition to crowd-funding, we're looking to crowd-create as well.  We want to forge a new relationship with our customers--one where we are responsive to their input and we serve their needs.</p>
<p>I'm 55 years old and I just recently went through the menopausal change.  I used to suffer from hot flashes and night sweats. They are still there in the background of my day somewhere, but I found an effective way to tame them without medication. </p>
<p>As a physician in psychiatric practice for 30 years, I've always seen medicines as a powerful last resort to be used when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.   But I've watched the pharmaceutical industry ""medicalize"" all kinds of normal life issues.  Now they're investing heavily to develop new drugs for menopausal women. I think we need to be cautious about this. Menopause is no more a disease than childhood, adolescence, or pregnancy and many of the often-recommended hormones and medications may cause more problems than they treat.  </p>
<p>But the standard non-medical advice on dealing with hot flashes - carry little fans and spray bottles, wear layers we can strip off in public, avoid spicy food and hot drinks, wear clothing that wicks away sweat, etc. - wasn't good enough for me.  I wanted something safe AND effective.  Something that would reliably stop or diminish my hot flashes BEFORE the sweating and distraction and loss of sleep.  </p>
<p>Fortunately for me--and you--my hot flashes coincided with a solar heating project my husband was working on with ""phase change technology"" and I wondered whether it could be used in clothing...</p>
<p>Sure enough, it has been applied to fabrics in NASA space suits, in firefighter gear, and in some sports gear.  But no one before now has created garments specifically for the 15 million or more of us women who need temperature regulation 24/7, day and night.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/156287/files/20131026162915-ascent.jpg?1382830155"" src="""" style=""""/>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I started working on this project, it was important to ME to have garments as stylish as they were effective, that I could wear ALL the time since hot flashes happen any time.  It was astounding to me that, not only was no one catering to our physical needs in the fashion industry, so many of the fashions for older women seem to be reworked versions of the designs created for younger women.  There are so many of us, I thought.  Doesn't anyone care what we want and need to wear?  So I figured we needed an insider to create a new paradigm in fashion and comfort for more mature women.  And that's how PrettyCoolWoman Cooling Tanks and Cooling Tunics began...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong> (and why it's better than anything else out there)</p>
<p>Our products use microencapsulated Phase Change Materials (PCM) that are embedded in the fiber of the fabric. Under 5000x magnification, they look like this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/164354/files/20131030120947-Outlast_Viscose_annotated.jpg?1383160187"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The patented processes for integrating PCM into fiber for textiles was originally developed for NASA for use in space suits. We license the technology from Outlast LLC, the patent-holder. ""Phase Change"" in this technology simply means the change from solid to liquid (melting) and liquid back to solid (freezing).</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center"">Here's an example of a common phase change material - water!</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/139050/files/20131017125644-pcm-ice.jpg?1382039804"" src="""" style=""width: 562.53px; height: 412px;""/></p>
<p>The graph shows what happens to the temperature of water as it absorbs heat. The flat portion of the line shows the constant temperature of 32° as it melts from ice to liquid. Water absorbs a lot of energy while it melts, but the temperature stays constant until the ice is completely melted. Of course, 32° is too cold, so we use PCM based on other materials (mostly waxes) that melt and solidify at ideal temperatures for natural skin comfort. It works without ever wearing out, for the entire life of the fabric!</p>
<p>Our PrettyCoolWoman phase change materials are pro-active.  They'll minimize your temperature swings so you don't have to sweat, but, just in case, we've added wicking action and antibacterial properties to the fabric too so you don't have to worry about a thing!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We Need Your Support, You Need Our Products</strong></p>
<p>We have assembled some of the best minds and hands we could find to create a series of prototypes.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175962/files/20131104190724-marpmontage1.jpg?1383620844"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Because this special fabric has to be custom made and dyed in large minimum quantities, we had to order almost a mile in black to get started!  It will be knit and dyed to our specifications right here in the United States and our production line in Albuquerque is just waiting for the material to arrive.</p>
<p>Here's your chance to order your CoolingTanks and CoolingTunics in black.  If we can sell a few hundred, we have a business.  When we get to a couple thousand, we'll be on our way to changing the world together!</p>

<p>We've already spent thousands of our own dollars getting to where we are now.  We've bought fabric, paid designers and pattern makers, and spent thousands of hours in research and development.  </p>
<p>Our initial goal of $25,000 will cover some of those expenses. Another $10,000 will  allow us to begin a line in soft white.</p>
<p>$60,000 will get us to run a third color (or style) that you get to vote on.</p>
<p>Check out our perks.  In addition to our PrettyCoolWoman CoolingTanks and CoolingTunics, we're offering a full line of <strong>PrettyCoolHome temperature regulating bedding</strong> that your sleeping partner will appreciate as much as you do!</p>
<p>And, if you can't use our products yourself, you can buy them as gifts!</p>
<p>Or, <strong>donate </strong>them to one of our listed non-profits or a non-profit of your choice that can accept gifts in kind.  We'll ship them there and make sure you get the receipt for your donation.  </p>

<p><span>1.<span>  </span></span><b>How do I know what size to buy?</b><span>  Our tanks and tunics are professionally designed and sized to fit most real women’s bodies in all shapes and sizes from XS  to XXL. Our <a href=""http://www.prettycoolwoman.com/PCW_Size_Chart.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sizing chart</a> shows the range of measurements that each size should fit. If you’re like me, you’ll want to also get tunics a size or two up to wear to bed!</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>  </span></span><b>Do your tanks and tunics shrink?</b><span>  They shrink just a little, maybe 3%, but then they stretch back out a little too when you wear them.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>  </span></span><b>What colors do you have?</b><span>  Right now just black—which seems to look great on every woman who puts it on!  The special fabric is expensive with high minimums in each color, so we had to purchase nearly a mile and could only afford one color!  If our Indiegogo campaign goes well, we hope to make them in a soft white.  If it goes REALLY well, we’ll ask our customers to vote on the next style and/or color.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>  </span></span><b>I need it now!<span>  How quickly can I expect to get it? </span></b>The fabric should reach our production plant in Albuquerque by November 25.<span>  Once we get some orders, we’ll get on production right away and get your tanks and tunics to you by December 11.  This should also be in time for holiday gifts! Our bedding products are available immediately!</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>  </span></span><b>Do the colors run?</b><span>  We have not had that experience, but you might want to wash the black with dark colors.  Wash in warm water and hang to dry.</span></p>
<p><span>6.<span>  </span></span><b>Will the phase change microcapsules wash out?</b><span> No. We chose this particular application of PCM because it never washes out or loses its effectiveness.  </span></p>
<p><span>7.<span>  </span></span><b>Will I be able to feel the microcapsules?</b><span> No, the fabric is soft and comfy—you can’t see them either.  You would never know they were there if they didn’t work so well!!</span></p>
<p><span>8.<span>  </span></span><b>What if I don’t want to take it off?</b><span>  I’ve had that problem!!  I wear my prototypes day and night!  Fortunately, I don’t sweat much when I wear them most days, but when I sweat during a workout, the added wicking and antibacterial properties prevent them from getting stinky!  You’ll still want to wash them regularly so I<br/>recommend getting at least 2 in each style.</span></p>
<p><span>9.<span>  </span></span><b>What will you do with the money you raise?</b><span> We’ve gone out of pocket to produce our first line in black.  That's guaranteed delivery, which is why we opted for the flexible campaign.  We also want to make them in a soft white and, then, other colors and styles.  We can’t fund this expansion ourselves.   We'll do it with your help and your input on new colors and styles.  </span></p>
<p><span>10. </span><b>I’ve tried wicking products before and they work a little.</b><span>  <b>How is yours different? </b>Wicking products pull your sweat away from your body so you don’t get chilled.  Our PrettyCool technology actually pulls your HEAT away BEFORE you sweat and then gives it back to you when you chill down, within seconds--again and again.  So your temperature stays in a much narrower range and doesn’t swing wildly with hot flashes and night sweats.</span></p>
<p><span>11. </span><b>Can I expect my hot flashes and night sweats to disappear?</b><span>  I can’t promise that they’ll disappear entirely, but they might!  Some of our testers have had them disappear entirely. What I’ve found is that I’m sometimes aware of a hot flash coming on, but it never really gets going enough to distract me!  I like that my body continues to do what’s natural without making me suffer!</span></p>
<p><span>12.</span><strong> What’s the deal with your bedding?</strong><strong><span>  Is it as good as the tanks and tunics?</span>  EVERYBODY </strong>loves our bedding!  It uses the same phase change technology we’ve put in our garments and optimizes sleep temperatures for everyone whether they have night sweats or not! We have a full line of bedding, including mattress pads, sheets, pillow covers, blankets, etc.  Check out our website at  <a href=""http://www.PrettyCoolWoman.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.PrettyCoolWoman.com</a> for details.  </p>
<p><span>13. </span><b>Why should I order now if I can just wait and order on your website? </b>The more orders we get now and the more money we raise, the more options we’ll be able to offer sooner.<span>  Also, we’d like our early adopters to be part of our inner circle. <br/>If you join us now, we’ll give you closer access to us; we’ll be able to hear and respond to your needs and suggestions even as we grow!</span></p>
<p><span>14. </span><b>What if I don’t like it? </b>We don’t think that will happen, but we want you to be completely satisfied.<span>  Just return your unused product to us within 30 days for a refund less the percentage that goes to Indiegogo.</span></p>
<p><span>15. </span><b>Can I use your products even if I’m not having hot flashes or night sweats?</b><span>  Definitely!  We’re targeting women with menopausal hot flashes and night sweats because the need is so obvious! But think about it--all clothing we put on is meant to help to keep us cool or warm.  Our tanks and tunics are the perfect base for both—under anything! If your work day involves going between hot and cold, say in a restaurant between stove and fridge, or between indoors and out, you’ll appreciate our tanks and tunics.  And--we’ve found that couples often sleep better with our bedding products because they optimize sleep temperature for both partners.  </span></p>
<p><span>We're also finding a surprising number of women who are not in menopause expressing a need for temperature regulation for all sorts of reasons including thyroid problems, food allergies, toxic exposures, cancer treatments, or even just a variable climate or changing activities. Whatever the reason, our products will help regulate temperature to the normal human comfort zone.</span></p>

Hi.
I'm Dr. Debra Solomon. Based on my own personal experience and need, I've created an effective, fashionable, non-medical solution to hot flashes and night sweats. It's so simple, effective, and life-changing that I want to share it with the world of women--and the men who share their challenges!!  
 

 
 Having experienced hot flashes and night sweats myself, I can tell you--they are:

Uncomfortable
Unpredictable 
Distracting
Distressing 
Disruptive 
and potentially Debilitating.

I needed to get past my temperature regulation issues to be at my best for my patients, my family, and my community and I know that there are millions of other women--and men and couples--with temperature issues who could experience life-changing benefits from our temperature regulating garments and bedding products too.  
Beyond making and selling products that work, we're looking at being game changers in the health/wellness world and in fashion.  We're done with the top down approach of the fashion industry and the medical world. We want to create a non-standard shopping experience in which our customers will be our consultants, our models, and our sales force--and share in the rewards of our success.  In addition to crowd-funding, we're looking to crowd-create as well.  We want to forge a new relationship with our customers--one where we are responsive to their input and we serve their needs.
I'm 55 years old and I just recently went through the menopausal change.  I used to suffer from hot flashes and night sweats. They are still there in the background of my day somewhere, but I found an effective way to tame them without medication. 
As a physician in psychiatric practice for 30 years, I've always seen medicines as a powerful last resort to be used when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.   But I've watched the pharmaceutical industry ""medicalize"" all kinds of normal life issues.  Now they're investing heavily to develop new drugs for menopausal women. I think we need to be cautious about this. Menopause is no more a disease than childhood, adolescence, or pregnancy and many of the often-recommended hormones and medications may cause more problems than they treat.  
But the standard non-medical advice on dealing with hot flashes - carry little fans and spray bottles, wear layers we can strip off in public, avoid spicy food and hot drinks, wear clothing that wicks away sweat, etc. - wasn't good enough for me.  I wanted something safe AND effective.  Something that would reliably stop or diminish my hot flashes BEFORE the sweating and distraction and loss of sleep.  
Fortunately for me--and you--my hot flashes coincided with a solar heating project my husband was working on with ""phase change technology"" and I wondered whether it could be used in clothing...
Sure enough, it has been applied to fabrics in NASA space suits, in firefighter gear, and in some sports gear.  But no one before now has created garments specifically for the 15 million or more of us women who need temperature regulation 24/7, day and night.  
 
  
 
When I started working on this project, it was important to ME to have garments as stylish as they were effective, that I could wear ALL the time since hot flashes happen any time.  It was astounding to me that, not only was no one catering to our physical needs in the fashion industry, so many of the fashions for older women seem to be reworked versions of the designs created for younger women.  There are so many of us, I thought.  Doesn't anyone care what we want and need to wear?  So I figured we needed an insider to create a new paradigm in fashion and comfort for more mature women.  And that's how PrettyCoolWoman Cooling Tanks and Cooling Tunics began...
 
How it works (and why it's better than anything else out there)
Our products use microencapsulated Phase Change Materials (PCM) that are embedded in the fiber of the fabric. Under 5000x magnification, they look like this:

The patented processes for integrating PCM into fiber for textiles was originally developed for NASA for use in space suits. We license the technology from Outlast LLC, the patent-holder. ""Phase Change"" in this technology simply means the change from solid to liquid (melting) and liquid back to solid (freezing).
 
Here's an example of a common phase change material - water!

The graph shows what happens to the temperature of water as it absorbs heat. The flat portion of the line shows the constant temperature of 32° as it melts from ice to liquid. Water absorbs a lot of energy while it melts, but the temperature stays constant until the ice is completely melted. Of course, 32° is too cold, so we use PCM based on other materials (mostly waxes) that melt and solidify at ideal temperatures for natural skin comfort. It works without ever wearing out, for the entire life of the fabric!
Our PrettyCoolWoman phase change materials are pro-active.  They'll minimize your temperature swings so you don't have to sweat, but, just in case, we've added wicking action and antibacterial properties to the fabric too so you don't have to worry about a thing!
 
We Need Your Support, You Need Our Products
We have assembled some of the best minds and hands we could find to create a series of prototypes.  

We now have our pattern and sizing perfected for real women's bodies and the right fabric blend for maximum effectiveness, look and comfort.  
                         CoolingTunic                                              CoolingTank
 
 
Because this special fabric has to be custom made and dyed in large minimum quantities, we had to order almost a mile in black to get started!  It will be knit and dyed to our specifications right here in the United States and our production line in Albuquerque is just waiting for the material to arrive.
Here's your chance to order your CoolingTanks and CoolingTunics in black.  If we can sell a few hundred, we have a business.  When we get to a couple thousand, we'll be on our way to changing the world together!

We've already spent thousands of our own dollars getting to where we are now.  We've bought fabric, paid designers and pattern makers, and spent thousands of hours in research and development.  
Our initial goal of $25,000 will cover some of those expenses. Another $10,000 will  allow us to begin a line in soft white.
$60,000 will get us to run a third color (or style) that you get to vote on.
Check out our perks.  In addition to our PrettyCoolWoman CoolingTanks and CoolingTunics, we're offering a full line of PrettyCoolHome temperature regulating bedding that your sleeping partner will appreciate as much as you do!
And, if you can't use our products yourself, you can buy them as gifts!
Or, donate them to one of our listed non-profits or a non-profit of your choice that can accept gifts in kind.  We'll ship them there and make sure you get the receipt for your donation.  
 
IMPACT!
Let's create a movement together!  We can't do this without you!  Even if you are not a customer right now, PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD THROUGH YOUR NETWORK!!!  Every woman will eventually reach menopause and likely need this relief. We want to be there, ready to serve. And that means we need to establish a sustainable business NOW. Help us do that, so we can be there for your mothers, your sisters, your daughters, your wives, your friends and maybe even you!

<p>With it's patented technique, <b><b>U.B.Fit.</b></b> takes the workout outside of the weight room. Imagine an athlete performing their normal training

1ST 50 CONTRIBUTIONS GETS A FREE SET
UniBody Fitness System (U.B.Fit.),
(previously Body Armor Fitness System), is a revolutionized invention that allows the user to receive
the benefits of lifting weights while doing a cardio workout. People have been donning ankle weights, weighted gloves,
weight vests, creating new and innovative ways to achieve a complete workout. ""UNIBODY IS THE EVOLUTION OF FITNESS"" 
The problem with these devices is that studies show that they cause long-term injuries due to excessive force on the joints & ligaments or either short-term damage by restricting the user's movement and causing improper movement. This
lightweight / stylish system has found away to achieve everything each of these
product attempts to provide for its user. However, U.B.Fit. not only provides a complete workout, Unlike all these other products, it disperses the resistance throughout the entire limb,
therefore eliminating the excess force on the limbs & joints. It also
prevents injuries by moving in total unison with the user and not restricting
the user's movement in any way, like regular weights.  
With it's patented technique, U.B.Fit. takes the workout outside of the weight room. Imagine an athlete performing their normal training
routine, sparing, running the court or football obstacle course, while toning
their muscles at the same time. Or imagine a fitness class doing aerobics with U.B.Fit. to give them a complete workout. We
plan to create an entire fitness franchise around this product that will
benefit regular fitness enthusiasts as well as underserved individuals in this
genre, such the youth, elderly, and military service member abroad. 


We've
 worked patiently behind the scene for the past 7yrs in securing a 
patent and finalizing a cost effective design that will achieve the best
 workout for the user of the U.B.Fit..
 After all our effort, and turning down several undesirable purchase and 
licensing offers, We have secured one US patent, another patent 
pending, soon to file a China patent, and have several key members onboard, including a retired 2x Superbowl Champion (Rodney Goosby) and a powerful attorney who's taken one fitness company public (Robert Herbst). U.B.Fit. has drawn interest from major players in the sports, fitness and corporate industry, including a Senior V.P. at Gold's Gym. We now feel its time to move forward with launching this phenomenal product to the world. 
The demand for U.B.Fit. has been so great, the most common responses to this invention are ""How come its not out yet"", and ""Where do I get one"". There
 is no other product that provides a total workout by giving the user 
complete mobility, strengthening during cardio workouts, reduces the 
possibility of injuries, and has more functionality (MP3, Download 
Music, Electronic Personal Trainer, etc..) as U.B.Fit..

Health Industry
Millions
of individuals are injured from car wrecks, work related incidents, and other
unfortunate events each year. Also, the Baby Boomer generation is the largest
demographics in the U.S. For these two reasons, medical rehabilitation is on an
up rise. The health / rehabilitation industries are  the secondary markets
we are pursuing for U.B.Fit..
Because resistance can be applied without excessive force to the
ligaments and the amount of resistance can be adjusted in increments, it could be used by Physical, Occupational and Sport therapists. Because
 the final design uses fluid to produce resistance, it actually gives 
the user the highly-desired, low impact resistance of a pool workout. 
That's right! U.B.Fit. takes the pool workout out of the water. We have
begun discussion with one of the country's largest medical product evaluation
company, SciMed
Partners. With their guidance, we are
certain that the U.B.Fit. could capitalize on this
growing market.

Our Solution


We have invented a multi-functional hospital bed which, among other things, is able to turn a person on his side to prevent the formation of bedsores. 




We developed patent pending invention that can turn patient on his side without any extra efforts from nurses. This helps to ensure the prevention of deadly bedsores and improves the quality of life not only for patients, but for nurses, as well. As of today, our product has no analogues affordable to regular home users, senior houses and hospitals.











How does it work in practice?

 
Who is it for?
This bed is designed for overweight people, seniors, people with disabilities, and the most important - those who are temporary unable to move.

Our bed will ease the job of the nursing staff by reducing the number of responsibilities, at the same time increasing the physical, social and psychological comfort of the patient. 

Yes, there is a group of people who are forced to suffer sleep deprivation because of their physical disabilities. For example, disadvantaged people, (paralyzed, with muscular dystrophy, etc.), overweight people, seniors, who cannot turn, sit, or lift their legs in bed without the help of nursing staff. 

When people cannot change their position for extended periods of time, the blood circulation gets disrupted, sores emerge, and  muscular dystrophy starts. 




Why we need your help?
We already have a working prototype, however, we need your help to finish it, release it to the market and make it accessible to home users.

We have finally finished and attached safety grating on both sides. The most important - they are flexible and you can move them up and down. That means if you do not need them - person can simply push them down.

<p>Deb has been through multiple tests over the years and the only diagnosis that has been given to her at this time is chronic fatigue.  Doctors coudn't find where the pain was coming from or why she has it.  She has multiple symptoms and many allergies that only hinder her way of life, and I want to help continue the fight for a diagnosis and medication/remedy for her since she now has no health insurance or is able to work due to the pain.</p>

All funding will go towards medical testing and doctor visits to help find a way for Deb to move forward in her life and bless others through her art.  If the goal is not reached, all funds will still go towards her medical needs. 

The Impact

Donating to this campain will not only help Debra, but others that have suffered like her with no diagnosis. 
I mentioned earlier that I am a project manager.  I pride myself in leading successful projects and want to add this one to my list because it means more than any of the others.
Help me help my friend.
Other Ways You Can Help


Contributing financially is not the only way you can help Deb..

Get the word out to everyone so that others like Deb don't suffer in silence.

cancer mechanism and ways to increase chances of a cancer patient’s
survival.  Since I have no medical
degree, and modern medicine is getting better and better results in cancer
treatment every day, my main area of interest and research was very early
cancer prevention; before cancer is possible to detect with any existing
instrument.  To be more precise, the
cancer life cycle period between a single cancer cell and a cancer of the size
detectable by medical instruments in any way.</p>
<p>My opinion is that cancer is a common name for various
diseases.  The cancer mechanism is
simple: a single cell in our body mutates and if the immune system doesn’t
destroy it, in time it becomes cancer. 
Today medicine can cure many cancer patients, especially if they are
lucky to have their cancer discovered in an early stages.  Generally, curing cancer is a long process
and a chances game.  But, at the time
when cancer is diagnosed, no matter how early it was, it is already a well
developed cancer, lethal if not treated.</p>
<p>Everyone has cancer cells in their body.  A healthy immune system constantly keeps
these cells under control.  It is known
that stress may influence our immune system in negative ways.  There are some theories that stress also may
reduce the ability of the immune system to keep cancer cells under
control.  Science today accepts that
various meditation and relaxation exercise techniques to reduce stress have
health benefits.  In other words, stress
is a strong enemy of our health and any stress reducing technique is welcomed.</p>
<p>My interest was to find a way to keep the immune system
stronger by reducing stress through a relaxing, compelling game.  I believe an ounce of prevention is worth a
ton of cure.  In order to fight stress and
improve health and the chances of our immune system to fight various diseases,
I created a game that has relaxing effects. 
Many users (even those that never play games) felt more relaxed after
playing it.  Due to the lack of funding
it was not possible to do scientific research of the spectrum of benefits,
cancer, blood pressure regulation, relaxation related or any other
benefit.  That is planned in the near
future.</p><p></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p><h3><b><b>The Game</b></b></h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>In order to offer such a program to as many people as
possible, an excellent, fun, compelling and relaxing game had to be made.  It was just made as Pentamino game iOS app
for iPhone and iPad and is currently offered on iTunes:</p>
<p><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pentamino/id639850897?ls=1&amp;mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pentamino/id639...</a></p>
<p></p><p>It is there for you and for your personal evaluation as to
how good, fun, compelling and relaxing it is, and if you like it or not.  It will be offered for free during this
campaign, so if you have an iOS device you can check our claims yourself for
free.</p>
<p>At this moment, the first item required is funding for the
final debugging.  After that, marketing

cancer mechanism and ways to increase chances of a cancer patient’s
survival.  Since I have no medical
degree, and modern medicine is getting better and better results in cancer
treatment every day, my main area of interest and research was very early
cancer prevention; before cancer is possible to detect with any existing
instrument.  To be more precise, the
cancer life cycle period between a single cancer cell and a cancer of the size
detectable by medical instruments in any way.
My opinion is that cancer is a common name for various
diseases.  The cancer mechanism is
simple: a single cell in our body mutates and if the immune system doesn’t
destroy it, in time it becomes cancer. 
Today medicine can cure many cancer patients, especially if they are
lucky to have their cancer discovered in an early stages.  Generally, curing cancer is a long process
and a chances game.  But, at the time
when cancer is diagnosed, no matter how early it was, it is already a well
developed cancer, lethal if not treated.
Everyone has cancer cells in their body.  A healthy immune system constantly keeps
these cells under control.  It is known
that stress may influence our immune system in negative ways.  There are some theories that stress also may
reduce the ability of the immune system to keep cancer cells under
control.  Science today accepts that
various meditation and relaxation exercise techniques to reduce stress have
health benefits.  In other words, stress
is a strong enemy of our health and any stress reducing technique is welcomed.
My interest was to find a way to keep the immune system
stronger by reducing stress through a relaxing, compelling game.  I believe an ounce of prevention is worth a
ton of cure.  In order to fight stress and
improve health and the chances of our immune system to fight various diseases,
I created a game that has relaxing effects. 
Many users (even those that never play games) felt more relaxed after
playing it.  Due to the lack of funding
it was not possible to do scientific research of the spectrum of benefits,
cancer, blood pressure regulation, relaxation related or any other
benefit.  That is planned in the near
future.
The Game
In order to offer such a program to as many people as
possible, an excellent, fun, compelling and relaxing game had to be made.  It was just made as Pentamino game iOS app
for iPhone and iPad and is currently offered on iTunes:
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pentamino/id639...
It is there for you and for your personal evaluation as to
how good, fun, compelling and relaxing it is, and if you like it or not.  It will be offered for free during this
campaign, so if you have an iOS device you can check our claims yourself for
free.
At this moment, the first item required is funding for the
final debugging.  After that, marketing
is needed to let the world know about the existence of such a
program/game/app.  Even putting this
project on IndieGogo is spreading the word about it and a kind of
marketing.  Thank you very much for your
support, either through funding or just through social marketing networking and

The right wig can make all the difference in the world – boosting self-esteem, even helping the healing process for chemotherapy patients.</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">Living with Alopecia can be very stressful as well. Feelings towards baldness have been devastatingly negative as most view hair loss as a sign of weakness. Most Alopecia patients are not frail. Alopecia is an autoimmune disease that causes a person to lose their hair as the immune system destroys the hair follicles.</p>

<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">Egypt Lawson, co-owner of Hairline Illusions, has been making and designing cranial prosthetics for over 2 decades and have listen to the stories from many patients. They have expressed to her how upsetting it is to experience their hair falling out in the shower and chunks of hair coming out when they brush. How their scalps ache and they can’t wear traditional wigs because of how much they hurt. How the experience of loosing hair robbed their confidence and self esteem. How they dreamt at night about still having their lovely hair only to wake up to a nightmare of realizing their hair is gone. One cancer patient shared as she looked in the mirror, she didn’t see herself anymore, she saw a feeble cancer victim. But after she received her natural looking wig from us she felt like a real woman – she felt whole again and her life was less stressful!</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">Yet the medical industry doesn’t accept hair loss as a vital medical problem and disregards the real distresses endured by so many.</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">So with that in mind our mission is to produce the Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis <em>a realistic looking medical wig for those suffering from Alopecia and Cancer to help aid scalps and restore confidence.</em></p>

<p align=""left"" class=""style7""><strong><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">What is a Healing Cap® Cranial Prosthesis</span></strong>?</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">It's a medical wig used to stimulate the scalp and aid infected sebaceous glands in the skin and protect scarred tissue from bacteria, microorganisms-inducing extra collagen production in the scar tissue.</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style7""><strong><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">What is a Disposable Healing Cap®</span></strong>?</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">The Disposable Healing Caps are similar to the cap of the wig. You can wear it under your own wig, scarf or hat. They are reusable and will last about a month. Pre-Order now and save!</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style7""><strong><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">What is made of</span></strong>?</p>
<p class=""style1"">The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis “Medical Wigs” foundation is made of medical formulated polymers that mimics skin. It is flexible, breathable, washable and reusable. Human hair or hair fiber is used on the outer-side of the foundation.</p>
<p class=""style1"">The Healing Cap is made with a variation of medical formulated polymers that mimics skin. It’s also flexible, washable and reusable.</p>
<h2 align=""left"" class=""style1""><strong><span class=""style7"" style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">How to use it?</span></strong></h2>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">Apply Healing Cap Medical Wig on scalp for a minimum of 4 hours a day up to 4 days. Clean inside of the cap with base cleaner and dry with towel before reapplying. So far patient results have varied from 1 week to 2 months depending on how long the patient wore the wig.</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">Wear the Healing Cap under your regular wig, hat or scarf to protect your scalp. The cap should be worn for at least 10 hours a day for 3 days. Clean inside of the cap with base cleaner and dry with towel before reapplying.</p>

<p class=""style1"">The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis will come in 4 sizes: Children, Adult - small, medium and large. Custom sizes will also be offered. Initially, Healing Cap will come in 2 sizes: Children and Adult.  Later we will offer more sizes.</p>
<h2 class=""style1""><strong><span class=""style7"" style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">Challenges</span></strong></h2>
<p class=""style1""><em>Production and Technical Challenges</em><br/>From the conceptual stage we have done tons of research on developing the Healing Cap® and Healing Cap® Medical Wig.  A few volunteers have tried the first trial version with good feedback. We require the cap to have different strengths for adults and children and have consulted with engineers to sort out issues including accurate materials with formulation and availability for mass production.</p>
<h2 class=""style1""><strong><span class=""style7"" style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">Objectives</span></strong></h2>
<p class=""style1""><em>A Healing Cap® for every cancer and Alopecia patient with scalp issues</em><br/>With your support, our objective is to make the Healing Cap® the standard. After the first production run the Healing Caps® will be given to participating physicians and organizations to distribute to hair loss patients for feedback. After we launch eventually physicians, pharmacies and hospitals will make the Healing Cap® accessible to patients.</p>
<h2 align=""left"" class=""style1""><strong><span class=""style7"" style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">Why the Healing Cap® Cranial Prosthesis?</span></strong></h2>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">It is estimated that approximately two percent of the population will be affected with Alopecia - over 4.5 million people in the United States. Alopecia is a autoimmune disease such as diabetes or lupus that causes a person to lose their hair as the immune system destroys the hair follicles. Hair can fall out in small areas, clumps or may lead to severe hair loss. Anyone can be affected by alopecia. Some people may have an increased risk if they have a family history of the disease. Children and young adults are also commonly affected. Scalp infections and rashes can develop in Alopecia patients.  The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can aid Alopecia sufferers of this common problem.</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">According to Cancer.org the Estimated cancer prevalence in the United States as of January 1, 2009 is 12,549,000 men and women. Chemotherapy patients can loose their hair as well as develop folliculitis (inflammation of a hair follicle) and head sores. The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can aid chemotherapy patients suffering from these issues.</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can also help with emotional pain of patients who suffer from hair loss, because they look extremely realistic - Enhancing one's self-confidence and positive self-image.</p>
<p align=""left"" class=""style1"">The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can be the answer to many of these problems.</p>

<p align=""left""> </p></div>","If given the choice, no one would want to lose hair due to medical reasons. Hair loss can be a crisis that's hard for many to take. The right wig can make all the difference in the world – boosting self-esteem, even helping the healing process for chemotherapy patients.
Living with Alopecia can be very stressful as well. Feelings towards baldness have been devastatingly negative as most view hair loss as a sign of weakness. Most Alopecia patients are not frail. Alopecia is an autoimmune disease that causes a person to lose their hair as the immune system destroys the hair follicles.

Egypt Lawson, co-owner of Hairline Illusions, has been making and designing cranial prosthetics for over 2 decades and have listen to the stories from many patients. They have expressed to her how upsetting it is to experience their hair falling out in the shower and chunks of hair coming out when they brush. How their scalps ache and they can’t wear traditional wigs because of how much they hurt. How the experience of loosing hair robbed their confidence and self esteem. How they dreamt at night about still having their lovely hair only to wake up to a nightmare of realizing their hair is gone. One cancer patient shared as she looked in the mirror, she didn’t see herself anymore, she saw a feeble cancer victim. But after she received her natural looking wig from us she felt like a real woman – she felt whole again and her life was less stressful!
Yet the medical industry doesn’t accept hair loss as a vital medical problem and disregards the real distresses endured by so many.
So with that in mind our mission is to produce the Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis a realistic looking medical wig for those suffering from Alopecia and Cancer to help aid scalps and restore confidence.

Introducing the World's First Healing Cap® Cranial Prosthesis and the Disposable Healing Cap®
What is a Healing Cap® Cranial Prosthesis?
It's a medical wig used to stimulate the scalp and aid infected sebaceous glands in the skin and protect scarred tissue from bacteria, microorganisms-inducing extra collagen production in the scar tissue.
What is a Disposable Healing Cap®?
The Disposable Healing Caps are similar to the cap of the wig. You can wear it under your own wig, scarf or hat. They are reusable and will last about a month. Pre-Order now and save!
What is made of?
The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis “Medical Wigs” foundation is made of medical formulated polymers that mimics skin. It is flexible, breathable, washable and reusable. Human hair or hair fiber is used on the outer-side of the foundation.
The Healing Cap is made with a variation of medical formulated polymers that mimics skin. It’s also flexible, washable and reusable.
How to use it?
Apply Healing Cap Medical Wig on scalp for a minimum of 4 hours a day up to 4 days. Clean inside of the cap with base cleaner and dry with towel before reapplying. So far patient results have varied from 1 week to 2 months depending on how long the patient wore the wig.
Wear the Healing Cap under your regular wig, hat or scarf to protect your scalp. The cap should be worn for at least 10 hours a day for 3 days. Clean inside of the cap with base cleaner and dry with towel before reapplying.
What sizes we offer?
The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis will come in 4 sizes: Children, Adult - small, medium and large. Custom sizes will also be offered. Initially, Healing Cap will come in 2 sizes: Children and Adult.  Later we will offer more sizes.
Challenges
Production and Technical ChallengesFrom the conceptual stage we have done tons of research on developing the Healing Cap® and Healing Cap® Medical Wig.  A few volunteers have tried the first trial version with good feedback. We require the cap to have different strengths for adults and children and have consulted with engineers to sort out issues including accurate materials with formulation and availability for mass production.
Objectives
A Healing Cap® for every cancer and Alopecia patient with scalp issuesWith your support, our objective is to make the Healing Cap® the standard. After the first production run the Healing Caps® will be given to participating physicians and organizations to distribute to hair loss patients for feedback. After we launch eventually physicians, pharmacies and hospitals will make the Healing Cap® accessible to patients.
Why the Healing Cap® Cranial Prosthesis?
It is estimated that approximately two percent of the population will be affected with Alopecia - over 4.5 million people in the United States. Alopecia is a autoimmune disease such as diabetes or lupus that causes a person to lose their hair as the immune system destroys the hair follicles. Hair can fall out in small areas, clumps or may lead to severe hair loss. Anyone can be affected by alopecia. Some people may have an increased risk if they have a family history of the disease. Children and young adults are also commonly affected. Scalp infections and rashes can develop in Alopecia patients.  The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can aid Alopecia sufferers of this common problem.
According to Cancer.org the Estimated cancer prevalence in the United States as of January 1, 2009 is 12,549,000 men and women. Chemotherapy patients can loose their hair as well as develop folliculitis (inflammation of a hair follicle) and head sores. The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can aid chemotherapy patients suffering from these issues.
The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can also help with emotional pain of patients who suffer from hair loss, because they look extremely realistic - Enhancing one's self-confidence and positive self-image.
The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can be the answer to many of these problems.
The Healing Cap® Cranial Prosthesis VS. Traditional Hair Replacement Wigs
Hairline Illusions™ unique Healing Cap `Scalp prostheses' differ from wigs, in many ways.


The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can aid in healing scalp rashes, acne and infections by protecting scarred tissue from bacteria and preventing microorganisms-inducing extra collagen production in the scar tissue.
The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can help to protect disease-weakened immune systems from the sun, and to regulate body temperature.
From a template of the client's head, The custom Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis is individually hand made with the highest quality human hair which is matched to the color, density and texture of the wearer's own hair.
Believable, realistic prosthetics - The custom Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis features a natural and undetectable hairline that can be cut into the latest, shortest styles and allows the wearer to comb the hair away from the face.
The wearer sleeps, showers and surfs in The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis only removing it for cleaning.
The custom Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis looks so real that many wearers do not suffer from the embarrassment and scrutiny of friends and family members which boost confidence!
The custom Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis is made with 100% Human Hair with no synthetic or animal hair fillers used. Wigs with fillers can cause scalp irritation.
The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis wigs do not cause patients scalp irritation like traditional wigs.  
The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis is hygienically manufactured with the finest materials   


Through this special campaign we are alo offering our Disposable Healing Caps® you can wear under your own wig, scarf and/or hat. 
The Disposable Healing Caps are not the cranial prosthesis medical wig.  It's similar to the cap of the Healing Cap medical wig.
Children and Adult Sizes are offered.
Save over 50% off the retail price if you order through this campaign.
The innovative Disposable Healing Cap® is reusable and will last about a month.






Perks

Every dollar is appreciated
Through this special campaign, we’re offering our supporters on Indiegogo a wide range of perks for every budget.If you have a loved-one who has medical related hair loss or work in this industry, our perks cater to everybody.
 


In addition to the physical ailments, the emotional and psychological pain of being bald especially for women and young children is beyond measure.  For the person who wants the chance to lead a physically healthy life, free of emotional torment, the traditional wig is not an option.  What is the alternative for the woman or young child suffering from these afflictions?

The answer is the “Healing Cap® Cranial Prosthesis.”  To minimize the damaging effects of the aforementioned ailments Hairline Illusions, a local wig manufacturer, has effectively created a replacement scalp, and like a healthy scalp, the Healing Cap® Cranial Prosthesis can accomplish the following physical benefits:
1.     Can stimulate healing of the scalp from the effects of burns, chemotherapy and alopecia
2.     Can aid in healing scalp rashes, acne and infections.
3.     Can protect scarred tissue from bacteria, microorganisms-inducing extra collagen production in the scar tissue
4.     Mimics scalp and looks extremely natural – as if the hair is growing from the scalp.
The elimination of the emotional pain and embarrassment brought on by hair loss and baldness may be the greatest benefit of all, especially for women and young children.
Following our inspiration for providing premium problem solving products for women with hair loss, we have developed a diverse base design that looks extremely natural. We have beta tested several versions of our Healing Cap through due diligence and have had an abundance of positive feedback and some great testimonials praising us on the affects of our product.
We need your help to fund the manufacturing and development of at least 10 Healing Caps to give to physicians for patient trials.  The follow-up research will enable us to refine the design for a more economical version for mass production.
After we have confirmed the design, we will mass produce a more affordable Healing Cap medical wig. 









 Front, Top and Side of Cranial Prosthesis
Patients are able to wear their hair off the face in many hairstyles!Human hair is collected locally enabling us to have full control over the quality of the hair.
We appreciate your pledges to continue the development for the final scalp prosthesis designed for mass production and are passionate to move this idea forward. We know with R and D funding we can accelerate the process of creating a scalp prosthesis that can better the lives of many.
The Healing Cap Cranial Prosthesis can be the best and economical substitute for surgery, hair transplant or hair weaving.
Traditional Hair Replacement Wigs can be hot, sweaty, and unrealistic plus cause even more irritation and infections of the scalp from the friction of the wig foundation and chemicals used to treat the hair.
We would like to mass-produce the Healing Cap Scalp Prosthesis and we want it to be perfect.
Making prototypes, formulating, molding and more testing is required to perfect the therapeutic base of the wig. The wigs need to last longer and wear well.
It has taken a lot of hard work and alterations to make it this far.  Now we require your support.

After surgery, 56% are left with mastectomy scars and often, no nipples.

BREAST CANCER SUCKS.



Even if you survive, it ravages the body, complicates relationships, and leaves permanent, uninvited marks. We think that covering these scars with a different kind of mark—a tattoo—can not only help mastectomy patients reclaim their bodies, but also turn something painful into something beautiful.







P.INK DAY 2013
We're planning the first inaugural, crowd-funded P.INK Day on October 21 at Saved Tattoo in Brooklyn, NY. At the event, 10 of NYC’s top artists will ink scar-coverage and/or nipple-replacement tattoos on 10 breast cancer survivors. Our partial lineup of participating artists includes:
Virginia Elwood from Saved Tattoo
Stephanie Tamez from Saved Tattoo
Michelle Tarentelli from Saved Tattoo
Ashley Love from NY Adorned
Roxx from 2Spirit Tattoo (San Francisco)
Shannon Purvis Barron of Indigo Rose Tattoo (Columbia, SC)
Nikki Lugo from Tattoo Paradise
Joy Rumore from Twelve 28 Tattoo
Miranda Lorberer from Pop's Tattoo Emporium
Jen Carmean from Monarch Tattoo





WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
Consider this an investment in art—body art. Your tax-deductible contribution will help commission a beautiful work that will serve as a constant, permanent celebration of life.

But more specifically: Our base goal of $25K will fund tattoos for at least 10 survivors and allow us to produce the event.


STRETCH GOALS


If we surpass this goal (which would be awesome) we can do even more.



$50K will fund tattoos for at least 25 more survivors in the future.
$100K will fund tattoos for at least 50 survivors in the future. 
$250K will help us grow P.INK DAY into an annual, international event and allow us to fund tattoos for hundreds of breast cancer survivors in cities across the globe. 
$500K or more will help us establish a permanent P.INK Space—a high-end tattoo shop/spa exclusively for breast cancer survivors, with tattoo services provided free of charge.

10/25 UPDATE
The first-ever P.INK Day was a success! We had an amazing time and are so glad we've been able to connect artists with survivors to help them in their recovery process. Thanks so much to the awesome Stephanie and Scott at Saved Tattoo and the talented artists who joined us. However, we haven't yet reached our goal and still need donations to cover the event and to fund future P.INK Days. Please help us make this an annual tradition. To see more on the event, check out this HuffPost Live story on P.INK Day 2013.









WHAT IS P.INK?
We began at Boulder-based ad agency CP+B with a handful of employees who had each been affected by cancer. Our goal is to connect breast cancer survivors with tattoo artists—two disparate communities that seem (to us) naturally allied. In early 2013 we launched p-ink.org on Pinterest, and what started out as a nights-and-weekends passion project has snowballed into a movement that we would all like to see expand.



AND IF YOU CAN'T CONTRIBUTE MONEY...

That's okay. You can contribute by sharing our page and helping us spread the word, using #PinkTattooDay. 

Thank you,
The P.INK Team

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Ricardo Banda I am a 27 year old guy and I was in a car accident 8 years ago that left me paralyzed from the chest down and bed ridden. I have been stuck inside my room for 8 years! The only way that I've been able to go outside is on a stretcher with an ambulance taking me to a hospital. Other then that I've only seen the 4 walls of my room. Think about it, prisoners who have committed rape and murder get to go outside for at least 1 hour a day to get some sun. I literally go months without seeing the sun shine in my face. I live with my parents who are both in their 60's and are unable to physically help me get out of bed and I've gained allot of weight I'm about 300 lbs, so it's not easy to move me. So they have to get me everything. Which is also taking their toll on them. If I want a drink of water or even if I just want to eat at a table I'm unable to because I can't leave my room. Please Help!!! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal here is to raise $21,000 for a new electric chair and a battery for my electrical lift. I've talked to several wheel chair company's and they've all said that new wheel chairs cost a little over $20,000 and a new battery for my electrical lift will be a couple of hundred dollars. So that's where all the money if going.  To help e see the sun once again whenever I want to see it not just when a ambulance takes me outside.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact this will have on me would be amazing! Like I said I haven't been outside in 8 years the affect that has on someone is hard to describe. I can't tell you how it's damaged me mentally and emotionally. Every Christmas/Birthday/New Years/Thanksgiving ect... has been spent inside my room. 8 years of my life might as well not of existed. I'm a ghost in this world... I would like to go outside and become somebody.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hey if you guys cant contribute money to the my cause no worries. Please! Spread the word on social media. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Youtube just spread the word and let as many people as you know, well know. Every little bit counts. :) </p>

We would like to change that, this weekend.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Who else is doing this? Who would we play?</h3>
  AFC Ann Arbor would be placed in the Great Lakes West Conference, central region.The teams for this conference 2014 include: Cincinnati Saints, Detroit City FC, Indiana Fire, Lansing United,and Michigan Stars. Lansing and Detroit have started successful teams where fan interest flourishes and games sell out. Supporter clubs create makeshift marching bands guiding neighbors to game days with drums and tubas. Talented players and coaches remain in the area for the summer. Local businesses benefit from promotion and support. Kids awe at the performances and seek autographs after. The quality of the play on the pitch is excellent. Most importantly to us, the atmosphere is alive, fun and<em> local</em>.

<p></p><p><b>ZeSa Fitness</b><br/></p><p>ZeSa needs your help in bringing the next evolution in
fitness to the workout world. Based on the principles of unstable training,
ZeSa founder Shanti Rainey has developed and patented the <b>ZeSa Activator
Training Platforms</b>. These Activators are fast becoming the new floor for
fitness training. They will be available in a range of difficulty levels,
making this training regimen perfect for the workout novice to the professional
athlete. All campaign funds will go to the manufacturing of the ZeSa Activators.</p>
<p><b>The Next Evolution in
Physical Fitness</b></p>
<p>ZeSa is a cutting
edge, never-before-seen fitness breakthrough that is the logical evolution of
the two biggest themes in contemporary training—balance training and functional
training.  In development for 15 years by fitness expert Shanti Rainey,
the program’s guiding principle is <i>Balance is Strength/Strength is
Balance ™</i>.  ZeSa incorporates the science behind instability training
into its unique program to help the human body improve strength and balance,
resulting in peak performance and maximum health and wellness. </p>
<p><b>What problems does
ZeSa solve in the fitness world?</b></p>
<p>The fitness industry
has so many different options, it’s hard to know what is best for each
individual.  ZeSa Fitness is the all-encompassing balance, strength and
cardio workout that suits and challenges everyone from beginners to fitness
enthusiasts and elite athletes.  The program generates maximum muscle
recruitment through the combination of unstable training and a progressive
exercise methodology.  The results are improved strength and peak
performance at every level.  And, ZeSa workouts take advantage of the
body’s natural fitness blueprint with low impact routines that focus on natural
movements performed in equilibrium to reduce stress on specific muscles and
joints.</p>
<p><b>What Makes ZeSa®
Unique?</b></p>
<p>ZeSa, a high
performance regimen, incorporates two basic components for unique, fun and
progressively challenging workouts.</p>
<p><u>ZeSa® Activator
Training Platforms</u></p>
<p>Shanti has personally
developed and patented the progressive series of <b>Activator Training</b> <b>Platforms</b> used
in all ZeSa workouts. They are the new “workout floor” and range in height from
the <b>Level I </b>1/8 spheres for beginners to <b>Level
IV </b>3/4 spheres for the experienced balance workout enthusiast.</p>
<p>The abundance of
“bio-feedback” generated by the use of the unstable platforms, recruits all
muscles including primary muscles (quadriceps, biceps, etc.) as well as
stabilizers and neutralizers. The result is dynamic and rapid development of
strength, agility and balance.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467830944/Capture_deklzp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><u>P.E.A.L Workout Method</u></p>
<p>During his years as a
personal trainer Shanti has designed and perfected ZeSa’s proprietary training
algorithm called P.E.A.L.  The letters stand for P. (position) E.
(environment) A. (action) and L. (load). By following the P.E.A.L. exercise
methodology, trainers and participants are guided through a dynamic progression
of exercise routines.  All the exercises are performed using the <b>ZeSa
Activator Training Platforms</b>.   Users vary the four elements of
P.E.A.L., which establishes the framework for an infinite series of exercises for people at all
fitness levels.</p>
<p><b>Be a part of our
journey on this exciting new breakthrough in fitness.</b></p>
<p>The next step in
introducing ZeSa Fitness to the market is to get the Activator Training
Platforms into the hands of as many trainers, yogis, physical therapists,
coaches and fitness enthusiasts as possible.  To do that we need capital
to fund the manufacturing of this dynamic and unique equipment, and we are
asking for your help.  When you do, you will have an opportunity to be one
of the first to try – and benefit from - the <b>ZeSa</b> <b>Activator
Training Platforms</b>.  See the PERKS  for more details.</p>
<p><b>Help us spread the
word!</b></p>
<p>We want you know how
much we appreciate your generous contribution to the production of the <b>ZeSa
Activator Training Platforms</b>.  If we can just ask one more thing
– please help us create buzz about ZeSa with your friends, families and
colleagues.  Social media is a great way to let people know about this new
fitness concept that could make a big difference in their lives.  So
please, follow ZeSa Fitness on Facebook and Twitter.</p>

performance at every level.  And, ZeSa workouts take advantage of the
body’s natural fitness blueprint with low impact routines that focus on natural
movements performed in equilibrium to reduce stress on specific muscles and
joints.
What Makes ZeSa®
Unique?
ZeSa, a high
performance regimen, incorporates two basic components for unique, fun and
progressively challenging workouts.
ZeSa® Activator
Training Platforms
Shanti has personally
developed and patented the progressive series of Activator Training Platforms used
in all ZeSa workouts. They are the new “workout floor” and range in height from
the Level I 1/8 spheres for beginners to Level
IV 3/4 spheres for the experienced balance workout enthusiast.
The abundance of
“bio-feedback” generated by the use of the unstable platforms, recruits all
muscles including primary muscles (quadriceps, biceps, etc.) as well as
stabilizers and neutralizers. The result is dynamic and rapid development of
strength, agility and balance.
P.E.A.L Workout Method
During his years as a
personal trainer Shanti has designed and perfected ZeSa’s proprietary training
algorithm called P.E.A.L.  The letters stand for P. (position) E.
(environment) A. (action) and L. (load). By following the P.E.A.L. exercise
methodology, trainers and participants are guided through a dynamic progression
of exercise routines.  All the exercises are performed using the ZeSa
Activator Training Platforms.   Users vary the four elements of
P.E.A.L., which establishes the framework for an infinite series of exercises for people at all
fitness levels.
Be a part of our
journey on this exciting new breakthrough in fitness.
The next step in
introducing ZeSa Fitness to the market is to get the Activator Training
Platforms into the hands of as many trainers, yogis, physical therapists,
coaches and fitness enthusiasts as possible.  To do that we need capital
to fund the manufacturing of this dynamic and unique equipment, and we are
asking for your help.  When you do, you will have an opportunity to be one
of the first to try – and benefit from - the ZeSa Activator
Training Platforms.  See the PERKS  for more details.
Help us spread the
word!
We want you know how
much we appreciate your generous contribution to the production of the ZeSa
Activator Training Platforms.  If we can just ask one more thing
– please help us create buzz about ZeSa with your friends, families and
colleagues.  Social media is a great way to let people know about this new
fitness concept that could make a big difference in their lives.  So
please, follow ZeSa Fitness on Facebook and Twitter.

<h2>ABOUT THE CHELSEA HUTCHISON FOUNDATION</h2>
<p>""The Chelsea Hutchison Foundation is a Colorado non-profit corporation formed by Julie and Doug Hutchison to help individuals, particularly children and young adults, who have epilepsy. The main focus is to raise funds to provide grants for trained seizure-response dogs who may be able to detect an oncoming seizure and provide warnings and/or respond after the onset. The Foundation also provides Emfit monitors for those in need. Emfit movement monitors are the latest technology for monitoring an individual who, during sleep, may experience seizures which a caregiver or family member should be alerted to. The Chelsea Hutchison Foundation is named for Julie and Doug's beloved daughter, Chelsea, who died in her sleep during a seizure in April of 2009, called SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy). During the 6 years that Chelsea had seizures, no one ever told the Hutchisons that a seizure could take her life, other than through an accidental fall or drowning. As a result of that omission, the Chelsea Hutchison Foundation raises SUDEP awareness so other families are not blindsided.""</p>

<p>Be sure to check out this <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/life-is-pain-wear-something-funny/x/3025345?c=activity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">update video</a>! There's bonus prizes for every contributor! </p>
<h2>What's All This?</h2>
<p><em>Life is Pain</em> is a line of T-shirts celebrating the fact that life isn't always easy or fair, but that's no reason you can't laugh in life's face and give it your best shot. Even when life is delivering lemons with a high-speed potato gun.</p>
<p><em>Life is Pain</em> acknowledges those rough patches and encourages you to keep at it. When things go awry, some really great stories are born!</p>
<h2>About the Shirts</h2>
<p>The main goal of this project is to make some funny shirts with an encouraging message of taking life less seriously. Every supporter will get first pick at the print run, some fun bonuses, and the extra shirts that get printed will make a debut in artist alley at this year's Denver Comic Con.</p>
<p>These tees will be printed at a local shop right in our little home town, run by awesome folks, each of whom has over 18 years in the screen printing biz. Needless to say, they know that they're doing. With their guidance, we picked out a soft-style shirt that feels like you've already worn it. The color(as you'll see below) is a dark heather that compliments the white artwork.</p>
<h3>Where the Funds Will Go</h3>
<p>All of the funds(minus the processing fees) will go toward printing and shipping everything to supporters in the United States. <br/><strong>*If you are pledging from outside the United States, extra shipping costs will be requested at the end of the campaign.</strong></p>
<h2>The Designs</h2>
<p>This is what you're really here for, the shirt designs! Check out the reward levels on the right and remember that you can mix and match any of the designs if you back a level that includes multiple tees/goodies. <strong>A survey will be sent to you if you pledge at any of the multiple-item levels.</strong> As mentioned in the video, every shirt that is rewarded to you amazing backers allows us to print <em>your</em> shirt and <em>an extra one for us</em> that can be taken and sold at Denver Comic Con.</p>

<h3>Handmade Scarf</h3>
<p>I wanted to offer something extra unique, handmade, and functional at the higher perk level: a handmade scarf. The prototype has been knitted and I'm working with my wife to apply the Eyepoke design to it. If that image interests you, great! If you are interested in a different option, I'll be happy to work with you if you plegde at that level.</p>
<h3>Original Art</h3>
<p>At the highest level you'll get an original ink &amp; watercolor illustration on watercolor paper. Here are a couple of tiny examples. What you'll receive will be bigger and more fun!</p>

<h2>All or Nothing Funding</h2>
<p>I've chosen to go with the All or Nothing funding option here at indiegogo, similar to the model at Kickstarter. The project can't come to life without the full funds because certain minimums need to be met at the print shop before they'll print the shirts. </p>
<p>This means that the project will benefit most from spreading the word. If you are unable to pledge, <em>please help by sharing the project!</em> That is a fantastic way to support the project and will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<h2>Risks/Challenges</h2>
<p>These are minimal. We have worked with the print shop in town before they are great. We expect no issues there. The other printed items will be coming from companies I've ordered prints from in the past and the quality is great.</p>
<p>As soon as June rolls around, your perks will start shipping!</p>
<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>Your support and spreading the word is greatly appreciated!</p>

What's All This?
Life is Pain is a line of T-shirts celebrating the fact that life isn't always easy or fair, but that's no reason you can't laugh in life's face and give it your best shot. Even when life is delivering lemons with a high-speed potato gun.
Life is Pain acknowledges those rough patches and encourages you to keep at it. When things go awry, some really great stories are born!
About the Shirts
The main goal of this project is to make some funny shirts with an encouraging message of taking life less seriously. Every supporter will get first pick at the print run, some fun bonuses, and the extra shirts that get printed will make a debut in artist alley at this year's Denver Comic Con.
These tees will be printed at a local shop right in our little home town, run by awesome folks, each of whom has over 18 years in the screen printing biz. Needless to say, they know that they're doing. With their guidance, we picked out a soft-style shirt that feels like you've already worn it. The color(as you'll see below) is a dark heather that compliments the white artwork.
Where the Funds Will Go
All of the funds(minus the processing fees) will go toward printing and shipping everything to supporters in the United States. *If you are pledging from outside the United States, extra shipping costs will be requested at the end of the campaign.
The Designs
This is what you're really here for, the shirt designs! Check out the reward levels on the right and remember that you can mix and match any of the designs if you back a level that includes multiple tees/goodies. A survey will be sent to you if you pledge at any of the multiple-item levels. As mentioned in the video, every shirt that is rewarded to you amazing backers allows us to print your shirt and an extra one for us that can be taken and sold at Denver Comic Con.


 


What Goodies Come with the Shirts?
Buttons
These will be 1.5-inch buttons. The art may be modified a bit before they are actually produced.

Stickers
2"" x 5"" in size, they compliment the shirt illustrations

Postcards
5"" x 7"" limited edition print run. These are only being made for this campaign!


Handmade Scarf
I wanted to offer something extra unique, handmade, and functional at the higher perk level: a handmade scarf. The prototype has been knitted and I'm working with my wife to apply the Eyepoke design to it. If that image interests you, great! If you are interested in a different option, I'll be happy to work with you if you plegde at that level.
Original Art
At the highest level you'll get an original ink & watercolor illustration on watercolor paper. Here are a couple of tiny examples. What you'll receive will be bigger and more fun!


I've Seen That Somewhere Before...
This avatar? Well, that's fantastic! I hope it made you smile. It's been floating around the internet since I made it back in October of 2003 and posted it to LiveJournal. And you know what happens to avatars posted there...
Anyway, this is the animation that eventually lead to the designs featured in this campaign. Anyone is welcome to use the avatar!


All or Nothing Funding
I've chosen to go with the All or Nothing funding option here at indiegogo, similar to the model at Kickstarter. The project can't come to life without the full funds because certain minimums need to be met at the print shop before they'll print the shirts. 
This means that the project will benefit most from spreading the word. If you are unable to pledge, please help by sharing the project! That is a fantastic way to support the project and will be greatly appreciated!
Risks/Challenges
These are minimal. We have worked with the print shop in town before they are great. We expect no issues there. The other printed items will be coming from companies I've ordered prints from in the past and the quality is great.
As soon as June rolls around, your perks will start shipping!
Thank You!
Your support and spreading the word is greatly appreciated!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Mom has a progressive form of MS and she has steadily gotten worse over the years.  She has tried many different treatments, including subjecting herself to 20 bee stings every two days for over a year.  She did this because she wanted to actively participate in our lives.  She wanted to walk into my youngest brother's graduation, she wanted to play with her grandkids and be with us for holidays and vacations.  Unfortunately, none of this worked and she has quickly deteriorated in recent years.  It wasn't long after she received her Master's degree that she had to retire from her job as a Social Worker.  When most people retire it's so they can spend more time with their family, travel the world or just relax.  She was unable to do any of this.  She had to retire because she could no longer work a full day, she couldn't sit up in her wheelchair and she couldn't drive.  At the age of 50 she had to go into a nursing home because we could no longer care for her at home.  This was the hardest thing we have ever done.  My mom is a huge animal lover (we used to have to move turtles that were in the road to the side, whichever side they were going to!) and she had to leave her beloved dogs.  She is now 57 and bedridden because we are unable to afford an electric wheelchair and her last one broke.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that depression has a profound physical effect on people.  Depression is killing my mother.  She has 3 beautiful grandchildren that she is unable to fully interact with.  She is unable to come home for holidays or just go on outings because we don't have anything she can sit up in.  This once vibrant, determined, selfless woman is now forced to lie in bed 24 hours a day and stare at the wall.  When she first went into the nursing home she brightened up the lives of the other residents.  She would go visit and talk with everyone and this kept herself and many other people happy.  Being a Social Worker, she knew the life story and problems of staff and residents alike and would ""unofficially"" counsel them..  She is unable to do any of this anymore.</p>
<p>The picture up there is one of the last times we were able to get her up for any length of time and that was taken in July 2011.  My youngest brother got married in October of last year and she attended the wedding, but only for 30 minutes because she was unable to sit up in a normal wheelchair. </p>
<p>I just want my mom home for the holidays.  But to do this we have to get her an electric wheelchair.  The basic model costs $10,000 and any customizations could raise the price to $25,000.  My mother has spent her whole life giving to other people.  She would kill me if she knew I was doing this, because she always believed there were people worse off than her, but for once she deserves to be the one that gets the help.  Please help me make her, mine, my brothers, and my niece and nephews holiday dreams come true and help stave off the worst effects of MS that depression helps cause.</p></div>","My mom has battled Multiple Sclerosis for 36 years.  She had her first major MS attack in 1984 when my youngest brother was only a year old.  But looking back on her symptoms, the doctors decided she probably began experiencing this horrible disease in 1976, the year I was born.  My mom has been a single mother for most of my life and without any support from my father, she selflessly raised us four kids.  She always put us first and would go years without buying anything new for herself.  She was always putting everyone else first.  She went to school over an hour away to get her Bachelor's degree and eventually her Master's degree so that we could live a better life.  It took her 7 years and multiple MS attacks to get her Master's, but she has always been determined and that was the proudest I've ever been of her.

<li>Research-based information about exercise after pregnancy</li>
<li>A step-by-step exercise progression (Levels 1-3 of the main exercise progression, post C-section, and recovery from bed/rest or multiples) and the accompanying printables and videos</li>

Exercise after pregnancy is incredibly important.  This goes way beyond fitting into your pre-pregnancy jeans.  Exercise in the first year of pregnancy has an effect on mom's fitness level and health for decades to follow.  It's important for mom's day-to-day physical, emotional, and mental wellbeing.  And it's important for baby's future exercise habits and long term health.  Exercise after pregnancy helps mom to function, prevents injuries, optimizes athleticism, and simply makes life healthier for both mom and baby.3.  Exercise after pregnancy is complex, yet under-emphasized by the medical community.  Exercise is complex on its own.  Add breastfeeding, postpartum hormonal changes, vaginal tearing, diastasis recti, C-section precautions, and the musculoskeletal injuries that can occur during and after childbirth, and that's bringing the complexity to a level no sleep-deprived new mom should have to navigate alone.  We medical professionals have done our research, sure, but we haven't communicated the findings to moms.  For some reason, we leave it to Pinterest and Instagram.  That needs to change. The MissionEverymom Athletics seeks to reach moms all over the world with the research-based information they need to get back to or start exercising after pregnancy.    Each exercise program with Everymom Athletics starts with the type of delivery, and with a physician or midwife's permission the program begins the day after coming home from the hospital (detailed permission packets for the physician or midwife are available as printables to make it easy for everyone).  There's even help for moms who had a baby years ago.  The new website will also feature up to date information about exercise gear, instructional videos for core muscle testing, exercise with a baby carrier or stroller, and diastasis recti testing.  For moms with pelvic floor problems, including incontinence and pelvic pain, there will be a growing resource database for physical therapists around the country (and world) who can help, including how to reach them. What We Need & What You GetThe cost for the new website is $3400.  Any contribution will help.  Everyone who visits EverymomAthletics.com will have open access to everything they need to get started with their post-pregnancy exercise plan, including: 
Research-based information about exercise after pregnancy
A step-by-step exercise progression (Levels 1-3 of the main exercise progression, post C-section, and recovery from bed/rest or multiples) and the accompanying printables and videos
A post-pregnancy walking progression
Exercise prescription packets for their physician or midwife
Access to a resource hub for connecting with a local physical therapist
Resources for exercising solo or with other moms

</div></div>","There are dozens of personal water filters and filter bottles on the market that clean water by ""trapping"" bacteria and cysts. Many of them are slow, awkward to use and complicated. Unfortunately, bacteria trapped in a moist and sometimes warm environment of a water filter will continue to live and multiply creating its own water problem. But by far, the greatest limitation of water filters is that they do not eliminate or even trap waterborne VIRUSES that are really the biggest concern of all in drinking water.

Meet Pure2Go
pure2gopurifier.com





Meet Pure2Go, the most advanced, unique and multi-functional, true water purifier in the world. Pure2Go ""kills""  waterborne bacteria and viruses instantly, ON CONTACT and ON DEMAND while also completely eliminating waterborne cysts such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. With Pure2Go, there is no waiting time or preparation required. As contaminated water passes through, it is purified INSTANTLY without the holding time and procedures other true water purifiers require.   



Adaptive, Functional, Flexible
Pure2Go can be used by one person or multiple users. With its cleanable and replaceable insert cartridges, Pure2Gowill be used over and over again for many years or stored conveniently for potential emergencies and disasters. Replaceable cartridges provide 300 US gallons of purified water. 



How did we come up with this design?
Over nearly a half of century, Water One, Inc. and its affiliate companies Water One of SW Florida and CALCO, Ltd. have provided ultra pure water to science and industry, and premium bottled drinking water to customers throughout the world. An industry innovator in many respects, we developed a proprietary water purification media, ViroBac, that in over twenty eight years of independent testing has been proven to kill waterborne bacteria and viruses on contact and on demand. Utilizing ViroBac ,Water One, Inc., was the first company in the world to produce a US EPA registered water purifier, allowing us to sell our first and second generation drinking straw style purifiers to US and international customers, including all branches of the US Military.

Since that time, the need and requirements for personal water filters and purifiers has changed dramatically, driven by the growth of outdoor activities, adventure travel and emerging nations, as well as the needs of military, missionaries humanitarian services and disasters. Inspired by a meeting with the US Marine Corp., Water One of Southwest Florida was determined to meet their new requirements, marrying our water perfection experience with form and functionality and setting a new standard for hydrating on the go. After almost two years of research and development Pure2Go is ready to launch. 

Why Do We Need The Money?




Independent laboratory testing using ANSI/NSF and US EPA Protocol has already established that the Pure2Go Water Purifier with ViroBac:

""Kills"" 99.9999% of waterborne bacteria
""Kills"" 99.997% of waterborne viruses
Eliminates cysts such as Giardia & Crypto
Significantly reduces radioactive contaminants in water

To meet US Military requirements for water purifiers, Pure2Go must be tested and certified to NSF P248 standards, a certification that no water filter or hand held water purifier have ever achieved.  The cost of this certification and other ongoing testing will be substantial but ongoing testing will remain a key component of our global sales strategy further setting Pure2Go apart from competitors.  Why is P2G Different, How Does It Work?

<p>This year, I discovered that something remarkable happens when overwhelming grief is combined with the drive to accomplish a goal. Having lost my close friend Kathy to ovarian cancer in February, I wanted to hole myself up in my house and avoid anything I considered difficult (like interacting with people), but somewhere within I had just enough energy to run. It’s been a lifelong, familiar means of exercise for me. What seemingly little energy I had transformed into long, focused runs that had me mentally working through the memories of Kathy’s final days. I realized in order to function normally, I needed to get out there and move it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/198440/files/20131114191610-photo_2.JPG?1384485370"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For Kathy to die was a shock because she was very good at living. She would send me cards that said, “I’m so thankful to have you in my life,” and I knew she meant it. She filled her days with meaning by investing in people.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/198450/files/20131114192107-photo_3.JPG?1384485667"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When someone you love has cancer, you might feel there is nothing you can do to make a real difference. The day I learned about Hello Gorgeous!, though, was when an opportunity presented itself to me. I simply visited their <a href=""http://hellogorgeous.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> and nominated Kathy for a makeover - and she was chosen! When we surprised her, she was walking to a meeting, looking tired and defeated. We’ll never forget how we saw her let out a heavy sigh. By the end of the day, Kathy’s funny, feisty personality had resurfaced as she bounced from guest to guest at her “reveal” luncheon following the makeover. She looked so polished and confident. Her makeup and new wig were so natural, enhancing her beauty. And her look was completed with a new outfit that she loved. Her special day was as much a gift to her loved ones as it was to her.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/198454/files/20131114192254-group_pic_.jpg?1384485774"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When Kathy died, I knew I had to channel my grief into something that gave me joy, as well as challenged me. When I think about Hello Gorgeous! it uplifts me. And I can’t think about Hello Gorgeous! without thinking about Kathy. I wanted to tell the world how these people made my friend feel so beautiful and adored. So, running for Hello Gorgeous! is what made sense to me. Running a distance that had mystified me after years of running marathons. 50 miles.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/198581/files/20131114200853-IMG_1567.PNG?1384488533"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>During my training, I felt close to Kathy because she didn’t know what her journey would look like, and neither did I. My challenge to myself to run 50 miles was a celebration of the gift of life and what people can do together to make life better for someone else. I knew I had the mental capacity to complete the challenge, but I couldn’t say with absolute certainty that I would finish. I was nervous. And I’m sure I was sometimes hard to be around because it was all I talked about. But taking this risk to help Hello Gorgeous!, and bringing people alongside me on the journey, was what brought me joy while I mourned.</p>

<p>Forty-seven days before my run, I made it public what I was doing, set a goal of raising $10,000, and I saw people give with such sincere generosity, my heart ached. A friend with an unemployed spouse and hospital bills gave what I thought was too much. But then I saw that this kind of generosity was sort of a trend. Countless people - some I’d never met - wanted to see my dreams come true. I heard stories of how cancer had touched their lives, how some of them knew women who had received a Hello Gorgeous! makeover, and from others, there was just sheer enthusiasm about my attempting to run 50 miles. In 47 days, any disenchantment I felt toward humankind fell away. I was humbled and awe-struck.</p>

<p>That support and encouragement carried me the entire distance. My feet felt lighter because of all the faces of loved ones I saw that day. I ran 50 miles, but the effort is a blur compared to the celebrating that happened leading up to, and on the day of, that monumental run.</p>

<p>My heart has been broken open and wide because of this experience. And I feel like it’s only a reflection of the generous hearts I’ve encountered. Last weekend at the Hello Gorgeous! annual luncheon, I was able to present them with a check for $17,049.24!</p>

<p>My life feels different since Kathy died. But I think I appreciate my life more because she wanted so much to survive. She lived fully, even in the darkest days, inspiring me to live that way too.</p>

<h2>
<br/>Why 50 Miles?</h2>
<p>Because it's time to go big! My friend Kathy Gribbin courageously fought a three-year battle with ovarian cancer. A few months before she died, I nominated her for a surprise makeover from Hello Gorgeous! of HOPE, Inc., and she was selected. They want women with cancer to feel beautiful, feminine and reminded of how loved they are. Kathy was surprised at work with flowers and chocolate and a big, ""Hello Gorgeous!"" by friends and stylists from The Beehive, an affiliate salon in South Bend. She received a facial, a manicure and pedicure, makeup, a new wig and a beautiful outfit - as well as a ""reveal"" party where 35 of her friends greeted her with ""Hello Gorgeous!"" This organization helped us celebrate Kathy in a profound way, and she loved every minute of it. She died on February 6, 2013. I've thought so often about what Kathy's surprise makeover meant to her - and what it means to the other women like her. So it's time for me to reach beyond what I know I can do. I've run 15 marathons, but to celebrate Kathy's life in my own way, and to give back to Hello Gorgeous!, I really need to go further.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>Beyond 50 Miles</h2>
<p>My goal is to raise $10,000. Kim and Mike Becker, the founders of Hello Gorgeous!, owned a large full-service salon in South Bend for ten years before selling it and committing to their mission: ""To provide complimentary, professional makeovers and cosmetic education to any women battling any cancer free of charge in our Mobile Day Spa and affiliate salons."" </p>
<ul>
<li>The average cost of a Gorgeous Visit is $700. (This doesn't include the cost of utilizing one of their Mobile Day Spas.)</li>
<li>The average cost to set up an affiliate salon for one year's worth of Gorgeous Visits is $5,000. Their goal is to foster two affiliate salons in every city in the U.S. so they can help at least 500,000 women each year.</li>

This year, I discovered that something remarkable happens when overwhelming grief is combined with the drive to accomplish a goal. Having lost my close friend Kathy to ovarian cancer in February, I wanted to hole myself up in my house and avoid anything I considered difficult (like interacting with people), but somewhere within I had just enough energy to run. It’s been a lifelong, familiar means of exercise for me. What seemingly little energy I had transformed into long, focused runs that had me mentally working through the memories of Kathy’s final days. I realized in order to function normally, I needed to get out there and move it.

For Kathy to die was a shock because she was very good at living. She would send me cards that said, “I’m so thankful to have you in my life,” and I knew she meant it. She filled her days with meaning by investing in people.

When someone you love has cancer, you might feel there is nothing you can do to make a real difference. The day I learned about Hello Gorgeous!, though, was when an opportunity presented itself to me. I simply visited their website and nominated Kathy for a makeover - and she was chosen! When we surprised her, she was walking to a meeting, looking tired and defeated. We’ll never forget how we saw her let out a heavy sigh. By the end of the day, Kathy’s funny, feisty personality had resurfaced as she bounced from guest to guest at her “reveal” luncheon following the makeover. She looked so polished and confident. Her makeup and new wig were so natural, enhancing her beauty. And her look was completed with a new outfit that she loved. Her special day was as much a gift to her loved ones as it was to her.

When Kathy died, I knew I had to channel my grief into something that gave me joy, as well as challenged me. When I think about Hello Gorgeous! it uplifts me. And I can’t think about Hello Gorgeous! without thinking about Kathy. I wanted to tell the world how these people made my friend feel so beautiful and adored. So, running for Hello Gorgeous! is what made sense to me. Running a distance that had mystified me after years of running marathons. 50 miles.
During my training, I felt close to Kathy because she didn’t know what her journey would look like, and neither did I. My challenge to myself to run 50 miles was a celebration of the gift of life and what people can do together to make life better for someone else. I knew I had the mental capacity to complete the challenge, but I couldn’t say with absolute certainty that I would finish. I was nervous. And I’m sure I was sometimes hard to be around because it was all I talked about. But taking this risk to help Hello Gorgeous!, and bringing people alongside me on the journey, was what brought me joy while I mourned.

Forty-seven days before my run, I made it public what I was doing, set a goal of raising $10,000, and I saw people give with such sincere generosity, my heart ached. A friend with an unemployed spouse and hospital bills gave what I thought was too much. But then I saw that this kind of generosity was sort of a trend. Countless people - some I’d never met - wanted to see my dreams come true. I heard stories of how cancer had touched their lives, how some of them knew women who had received a Hello Gorgeous! makeover, and from others, there was just sheer enthusiasm about my attempting to run 50 miles. In 47 days, any disenchantment I felt toward humankind fell away. I was humbled and awe-struck.

That support and encouragement carried me the entire distance. My feet felt lighter because of all the faces of loved ones I saw that day. I ran 50 miles, but the effort is a blur compared to the celebrating that happened leading up to, and on the day of, that monumental run.


My heart has been broken open and wide because of this experience. And I feel like it’s only a reflection of the generous hearts I’ve encountered. Last weekend at the Hello Gorgeous! annual luncheon, I was able to present them with a check for $17,049.24!


My life feels different since Kathy died. But I think I appreciate my life more because she wanted so much to survive. She lived fully, even in the darkest days, inspiring me to live that way too.

Why 50 Miles?
Because it's time to go big! My friend Kathy Gribbin courageously fought a three-year battle with ovarian cancer. A few months before she died, I nominated her for a surprise makeover from Hello Gorgeous! of HOPE, Inc., and she was selected. They want women with cancer to feel beautiful, feminine and reminded of how loved they are. Kathy was surprised at work with flowers and chocolate and a big, ""Hello Gorgeous!"" by friends and stylists from The Beehive, an affiliate salon in South Bend. She received a facial, a manicure and pedicure, makeup, a new wig and a beautiful outfit - as well as a ""reveal"" party where 35 of her friends greeted her with ""Hello Gorgeous!"" This organization helped us celebrate Kathy in a profound way, and she loved every minute of it. She died on February 6, 2013. I've thought so often about what Kathy's surprise makeover meant to her - and what it means to the other women like her. So it's time for me to reach beyond what I know I can do. I've run 15 marathons, but to celebrate Kathy's life in my own way, and to give back to Hello Gorgeous!, I really need to go further.
Beyond 50 Miles
My goal is to raise $10,000. Kim and Mike Becker, the founders of Hello Gorgeous!, owned a large full-service salon in South Bend for ten years before selling it and committing to their mission: ""To provide complimentary, professional makeovers and cosmetic education to any women battling any cancer free of charge in our Mobile Day Spa and affiliate salons."" 

The average cost of a Gorgeous Visit is $700. (This doesn't include the cost of utilizing one of their Mobile Day Spas.)
The average cost to set up an affiliate salon for one year's worth of Gorgeous Visits is $5,000. Their goal is to foster two affiliate salons in every city in the U.S. so they can help at least 500,000 women each year.

<p>On August 17th, 2011 Katie McCall, a CA licensed midwife, was convicted of practicing medicine without a license for a 2007 birth she assisted as a midwifery student. She was arrested, charged, tried and convicted while holding her medical license in good standing and while having no complaints issued against her as a licensed professional. She has never lost a baby or harmed anyone while serving the over 1,000 birthing families she has served in midwifery care and education over the past ten years. She has never had a complaint filed by a family she has cared for. <br/> <br/>Her criminal charge arose from a home birth where her supervising midwife could not arrive because she was at another birth. Instead of leaving the family to birth unassisted, Katie stayed.  She recommended that the family transfer to the hospital and the family refused.  They were aware that she was only a student midwife and that she was unable to secure an overseeing midwife. The original complaint was made by a bystander and not by the family who chose to birth at home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the mother began to push, the baby got stuck in a condition called shoulder dystocia.  Using her training as a student, Katie performed the Gaskin maneuver to free the baby.  The maneuver was successful, however, the mother began to hemorrhage due to a partially retained placenta.  Again, using her training, Katie was able to stop the bleeding and protect the mother from harm.  She went on to get her license and was later arrested from her licensed midwife office and taken to jail. At trial, Katie argued through counsel that her practicing medicine was justified due to the emergency situations above. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In most every state that recognizes out of hospital midwifery, Katie would not have been charged for refusing to abandon a woman who was birthing that refused a transport. But the state of California's legislation makes something as simple as palpating a pregnant belly or taking a blood pressure a felony.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite expert testimony from the Assistant Director of the Emergency Department at UCLA-Santa Monica and a renowned OB/GYN that Katies actions potentially saved two lives, a jury convicted her of one felony count of practicing medicine without a license at trial. Hundreds of letters were written in defense of Katie and the judge remarked that he had never seen so many people show support to a convicted criminal in his court room.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>On September 16, 2011, despite the fact that Katie has no prior criminal record of any sort, the judge upheld the felony conviction and sentenced Katie to 3 years probation and told her she cannot work as a midwife during that time. She was not given any time in prison or jail, but was instead given 280 hours of community service and $10,000 in restitution to the CA Medical Board, which was down from the $45,000 they were asking for to reimburse them for their investigation costs. This amount shocked even the judge, especially since the one birth was the only birth Katie was being tried for and the state of California is in such dire economic straits. Katie is unable to work in her profession during probation and the medical board will revoke her license as a result of the conviction. This is causing untold financial hardship on Katie, a single mother, and her two children, Christiana and Robert. She may never be allowed to be a midwife in CA again.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Fact: Health Literacy Saves Lives.</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">When people have access to information about their health and wellness, they are more equipped to make healthy decisions.  With advancements in mobile, touchscreen, and tablet technology, people are more informed than ever, with one notable exception: the doctor's office.</p>
In many ways, going to a healthcare facility feels like visiting the past. The computers are outdated, and there's no good way for a patient to view the information that their doctors are inputting.  Despite all the great advances of the last few years, a lack of health literacy is still a devastating issue. It needs to be addressed multi-laterally: not just through the development of apps and dissemination of information, but in all related fields as well.

<a name=""FAQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">F.A.Q.</h3></a>
<b>What is Health Literacy?</b>
Health literacy is the ability for an average person to understand everything that influences their health and wellness and make proper decisions based on that information. For example, it includes the ability to understand instructions on prescription drug bottles, appointment slips, medical education brochures, doctor's directions and consent forms, and the ability to negotiate complex health care systems. <a href=""http://nnlm.gov/outreach/consumer/hlthlit.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">[source]</a> <div>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>How Do We Help Patients?</b>
The more patients can understand what is occurring in their bodies, the more they engage in the health care process. This workstation will facilitate better communication and collaboration between patients and providers, enabling a visually accessible approach when reviewing images, charts, and lab results. Electronic Health Records such as EPIC and Cerner can readily be displayed on Informacio. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It will allow physicians to utilize touchscreen technology to draw, annotate and write notes onto CT Scans, MRIs, patient notes and other medical documentation records that need to be updated. This decreases time spent double-checking notes and reduces miscommunications. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How Do We Help Doctors and Care Givers?</b>
<i>Informacio'</i>s touchscreen and tablet technology will help to engage the patient in their care (as per Meaningful Use, Accountable Care Organization (ACO) regulations). The provider and the patient can easily view the details of the patient care on the large touchscreen. For providers who have not yet begun to update to modern technology, <i>Informacio</i> still offers the benefits of being able to share information with the patient in different display modes. Since the workstation supports multiple display formats and viewing angles, one workstation can accommodate various types of users - standing, sitting, or even bedridden. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How Do We Help Hospitals, Institutions, and Healthcare Medical Facilities?</b>
It can become costly and frustrating for providers when they need to continually repurchase furniture to accommodate new technology. The flip side of that - not purchasing furniture that accommodates new technology - casts aside the advances in health literacy that that technology effects.

 F.A.Q. |

Fact: Health Literacy Saves Lives.
When people have access to information about their health and wellness, they are more equipped to make healthy decisions.  With advancements in mobile, touchscreen, and tablet technology, people are more informed than ever, with one notable exception: the doctor's office.
In many ways, going to a healthcare facility feels like visiting the past. The computers are outdated, and there's no good way for a patient to view the information that their doctors are inputting.  Despite all the great advances of the last few years, a lack of health literacy is still a devastating issue. It needs to be addressed multi-laterally: not just through the development of apps and dissemination of information, but in all related fields as well.
  Who are we, and what are we doing to help? We are a global team of designers, scientists, and entrepreneurs who have been motivated by personal frustrations with health-related information access.
Combining modern furniture design and information technology, our project develops integrated solutions that enhance healthcare settings for both the patient and clinician.
Meet Informacio. After 12 prototypes, our team has created a modern healthcare workstation that will easily accommodate users of various technical levels, allowing increased access to relevant medical information. With an eye to the future, these workstations will support future hardware and software, creating a seamless upgrade path for patient centers.
Informacio is designed to incorporate a 27-inch touchscreen table PC that can be used as a surface-level workstation, or rotated to an upright position (similar to a traditional computer). A keyboard and mouse are embedded inside, conserving space.

What We Need

Our fundraising goal is $30,000, which will allow us to build the final, functional prototype out of composite materials. Working with local manufacturers, we will ensure that the final prototype is produced on antimicrobial surfaces and meets our high level of standards. In producing our final prototype, we will be able to place Informacio in a clinic or primary care office and begin user testing.

Here is a breakdown of how the funds will be spent:


What You Get

F.A.Q.
What is Health Literacy?
Health literacy is the ability for an average person to understand everything that influences their health and wellness and make proper decisions based on that information. For example, it includes the ability to understand instructions on prescription drug bottles, appointment slips, medical education brochures, doctor's directions and consent forms, and the ability to negotiate complex health care systems. [source] 

How Do We Help Patients?
The more patients can understand what is occurring in their bodies, the more they engage in the health care process. This workstation will facilitate better communication and collaboration between patients and providers, enabling a visually accessible approach when reviewing images, charts, and lab results. Electronic Health Records such as EPIC and Cerner can readily be displayed on Informacio. 

It will allow physicians to utilize touchscreen technology to draw, annotate and write notes onto CT Scans, MRIs, patient notes and other medical documentation records that need to be updated. This decreases time spent double-checking notes and reduces miscommunications. 

How Do We Help Doctors and Care Givers?
Informacio's touchscreen and tablet technology will help to engage the patient in their care (as per Meaningful Use, Accountable Care Organization (ACO) regulations). The provider and the patient can easily view the details of the patient care on the large touchscreen. For providers who have not yet begun to update to modern technology, Informacio still offers the benefits of being able to share information with the patient in different display modes. Since the workstation supports multiple display formats and viewing angles, one workstation can accommodate various types of users - standing, sitting, or even bedridden. 

How Do We Help Hospitals, Institutions, and Healthcare Medical Facilities?
It can become costly and frustrating for providers when they need to continually repurchase furniture to accommodate new technology. The flip side of that - not purchasing furniture that accommodates new technology - casts aside the advances in health literacy that that technology effects. With Informacio, repurchasing furniture will not have to occur as frequently. This prevents unnecessary expenses for the facilities. New and emerging technologies can easily be integrated into our workstation, including new versions of tablets, smart phones and other digital devices.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

He has touched the lives of so many in such beautiful ways.  Recently he had an accident which left him with 18 stitches, multiple lacerations on his hand and a huge medical bill.  Unfortunately he has no insurance and cannot afford to pay.  This is a way for all the people who have met Henry (and those who have yet to meet him) to help him out.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The device is 'simple' in operation, requiring only the pull of one finger on an 'ejected' stowed ""pull ring"" which is activated by a bi-lateral force against each (occupied, belted), seatbelt.  Even the impact 'g-force' weight of a baby's car seat will activate the unit. Once activated, the unit immediately ejects a pull ring, which simultaneously causes a bright, flashing,  LED light to activate, which indicates the location of each (belted) passenger (in the dark) - so that none would be left behind.   The ejected pull ring offers the 'opportunity' to cut the seat belt by being pulled perpendicularly, internally (across) the seat belt.   An internal surgical steel blade instantly sever the threaded, 2.9 inch wide standard sea belt.  If there is no need to cut the seat belt, the pull ring would simply be pushed back inside the unit and reset for a 'possible' next event where it might be needed.  Changing cars? Simply remove each individual unit, using the special supplied tool, and mount them on the seat belts in the new car.                                                                                                        THE REAL 'PRIORITY' COMPARISON As I write this update, the campaign has less than seven days of life.  We  know that many more lives could be saved if we could eliminate the fear of entanglement  from the equation.   We covet your support in this lifesaving safety effort, even at this late hour, which is why every one who supports us at each level will receive at least one unit for the driver.  Benefits: This simple product will save lives - possibly your own.  Then, once away from the accident, when everyone is safe (hopefully), you can use that $725.00 ""smart phone"" to call for help - or 'stew' in your regret for not taking advantage to prepare for a clear and present danger your family faces every time you drive your car, IN FAVOR OF ELECTRONIC 'TOYS'.  THE TRUTH STANDS FOR ITSELF - THERE SHOULD BE PRIORITIES.   This product is about self-preservation of you and your family in a (possible) crisis situation. This is the one product, like paper insurance, that  you don't need until you need it, then you'll be glad you have it.   Noah didnt wait for the rain to fall before starting to build the Ark.  Remember, the American-made ""RIP-CORD"" Emergency Seatbelt Cutter is the best (and least expensive) ""Insurance At The Accident"".                     ANOTHER REASON WHY WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT  We need funds to launch a 'buckle-up'  publicity seatbelt campaign, and build a demonstration device for the simulation of different escape techniques using the ""RIP-CORD""  to remove the fear of entanglement.  We feel this campaign will be more effective than anything that has been offered before , since we uniquely offer each belted passenger an on-board device to enable an 'E.S.C.ape' from that (possible) deadly restraint.  Unlike giving for a general 'feel good' social cause, buying that must-have newest cell phone, or latest 'game', your support could be a direct reason for a life being saved  -  possibly your own.  We will honor all campaign perks to the end of this campaign, it's not too late.Should we ultimately fail to reach our campaign goal, which seems likely at this point, we will resubmit an unpgraded campaign version at a later date - but will wonder how many lives may have been lost in the meantime, due to non response.  Thanks for your support, !  Talk it up!   Johnny out.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>ALEX communicates with your phone or tablet using Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy. This saves your phone's battery, extends ALEX's battery life to seven days, and reduces the number and duration of Bluetooth transmissions.</p>

<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Why We Developed ALEX</h1>
<p>Our founding team began with an idea of creating something to protect people against the health concerns brought on by prolonged computer and smartphone use.

</div><p> </p></div>","About this project Beat Poor Posture.End neck and back pain with ALEX! ALEX is your wearable posture coach and posture tracker. It's the first wearable to accurately measure the angle of your neck and the position of your head, so you can put an end to neck pain.More than 80% of office workers suffer from Forward Head Posture (FHP) or Text Neck.(Just look around.) These conditions are caused by looking down at laptops, smartphones and other digital devices for extended periods. Even if you've never heard of FHP or Text Neck, you probably know their effects: Soreness and stiffness in your neck and spine.In the short term, FHP and Text Neck can make it that little bit harder to get out of bed in the morning or to sit in your chair at work. In the long term they can lead to chronic pain and more serious spinal issues. Medical studies have even shown that physiological changes invoked by bad posture can include increased levels of cortisol and decreased testosterone, leading to stress and depression.Many products promise relief from the pain cause by an epidemic of poor posture. We've tested out quite a few wearables and found that they're often overly complicated, inaccurate or inconvenient. And while pills and massage therapies exist to treat the pain, none of these options effectively treat the underlying problem: Poor posture.Our team of biomechanical engineers, developers and technology experts created ALEX to be different.ALEX doesn’t treat your pain, but addresses the causes underlying your pain by gently coaching you towards better posture, every day.How ALEX WorksA number of other wearables claim to determine posture via devices fixed on your wrist or clothing. ALEX, on the other hand, sits lightly on the back of your neck, the only reliable location to measure neck posture. When you adopt poor posture for more than a few minutes, ALEX vibrates gently, encouraging you to improve. You can customise the exact length of time and the intensity of the vibration using ALEX’s companion smartphone app.The app also lets you track your progress over time and monitor your posture in real time.ALEX can track the angle of your neck and the position of your head, relative to your body. This means it can tell if you’re looking too far down or if you’re holding your head too far forward. 4 Easy Steps to Wearing ALEXStep 1Squeeze or separate the legs of the device to adjust the position of the sensor module to just below your hairline.Step 2Place the sensor module on the back of your neck and hang the legs over your ears. ALEX's legs will naturally unfold to achieve the correct position.Step 3Ensure that Alex is not placed on top of a shirt collar, or other clothing or jewelry.Step 4Check that the sensors are working correctly by selecting Avatar Mode in the companion coaching app and tilting your neck back and forth while watching the screen. You can calibrate ALEX for your own posture using the app. About the Coaching AppThe accompanying coaching app will help you get the most from ALEX. It offers a number of unique features that help you track your posture over time and make improvements.Avatar Mode allows you to view and manage posture changes in real-time. The app also provides graphs that track your progress toward improving your posture with ALEX. The video below demonstrates these features.

The companion coaching app's feedback settings let you set the length of time before ALEX alerts you to poor posture, the angle at which it determines your posture to be poor, and the strength of the vibration.
ALEX communicates with your phone or tablet using Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy. This saves your phone's battery, extends ALEX's battery life to seven days, and reduces the number and duration of Bluetooth transmissions.
We're working on even more features and will announce these in due course!

The Technology Inside ALEX
Vibration Motor: Provides feedback to users when they adopt poor posture. (This is built into ALEX. You don't need to rely on your phone for poor posture alerts.)
Tri-Axis Motion Sensor: Measures the angle of your neck in real time and sends data to the companion application.
Bluetooth 4.0 LE: Connects ALEX to the app on your mobile device.
Flash memory: Retains posture data temporarily before syncing with the App.
LED: Indicates power status (on/off), Bluetooth connectivity status, and battery recharging status.
ALEX features extremely precise accelerometers to measure the exact angle of your neck
 
Why We Developed ALEX
Our founding team began with an idea of creating something to protect people against the health concerns brought on by prolonged computer and smartphone use. We thought; 'Protective clothing is available for dangerous work and for sports, so why not when we do other activities that also lead to ill-health?
Our CEO, Jonathan and Co-Founder, Youngjoon, a Biomedical Engineering Professor, spent years finding a solution that really addresses the shortcomings of other posture wearables.
The design process
We also wanted to create something that would resolve poor posture in the long term, rather than provide a quick fix through short term pain relief. The idea is that once ALEX coaches you to better posture, you’ll develop muscle memory and no longer need to wear it.
 
Where We Are In Development
We began designing the technology for ALEX around two years ago. By late 2014 we were able to track poor posture using this technology and began work to bring it to life.
Through numerous iterations we've worked tirelessly to ensure that ALEX tracks posture with precision, looks and feels great and makes a positive long term impact on health.

 

Timeline of the life of ALEXWe're proud of how much we've achieved. We have been testing market-ready prototypes and have completed development of the complimentary smartphone app.

We believe that inflammation plays a significant role in all disease, specifically cancer. It is also known that angiogenesis is a major component to tumor development.

Published literature has established a firm connection between toxins and breast cancer.  </p><p>Thus, our goal is to identify a connection between the MTHFR gene mutation and a higher risk for breast cancer.  From there, we can illustrate how the diagnostic exam can be utilized as a tool primarily for the detection and augmentation of risk factors and to implement a nutritional protocol to reduce modifiable risks for having this gene mutation and potentially reduce the risks for breast cancer.</p><p></p><p><b>METHODOLOGY AND YOUR HELP</b></p><p><b>If you will help me raise $315,000</b>, we can conduct pioneering research, working with 100 women at our Long Island facility during the initial 18 months of this study.  Using the non-invasive Breast Thermography, we will identify the prevalence of the MTHFR gene mutation in “high risk” women, further identify gene mutation and the link to increased risk, and implement holistic nutritional and lifestyle adjustments that will avoid toxins.  The prevention protocol will incorporate the synergistic effect of Iodine, Vitamin D, Boswellia Sacra, an anti-inflammatory diet, breast self-exam, and stress relief. </p><p>Our hypothesis is that we will be able to demonstrate how reversing basic nutritional deficiencies and simple life style changes in these high risk women can reduce risk.</p><p>We want to empower women to minimize their own risks of breast cancer.</p><p></p><p><b>PARTNERSHIP </b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/599872/files/20140523111120-Dr._George_Einstein.jpg?1400868680"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><b><br/></b><p></p><p><b>George Einstein, PhD, DSc HC</b> is my PhD mentor.

I have witnessed this amazing transformation in countless patients’. Inspired by what I have seen, I decided to pursue an MD/PhD.  I know, now more than ever, that a preventative approach to healthcare is the future of medicine. Here is how we will help this future be realized.PREVENTION RESEARCHAs a part of my MD/PhD degree at the USAT School of Medicine, I aim to publish research data that will help fortify the movement of preventative medicine throughout the country.  This thesis is titled: Digital Infrared Imaging and Genetic Testing as a Tool to Stratify Risk for Breast Cancer, Implement and Monitor Impact of Breast Cancer Prevention Protocol, and Monitor Decrease in Fibrocystic Breast Disease as well as Minimizing Neo-vascularity. Bear with me, but I need to speak technically with you for a moment.My research seeks to fortify the evidence that Breast Thermography can stratify women into high, moderate, and low risk groups for breast cancer. Thermography detects the heat pattern within a body part. We believe that inflammation plays a significant role in all disease, specifically cancer. It is also known that angiogenesis is a major component to tumor development. With the thermogram, we can identify areas of “neovascularity” (indicating new blood vessels leading to a given area) which will alert us to the fact an aggressive prevention protocol is needed.This neovascularity can be seen as early as 6-8 years before the problem is detectable on a mammogram . . . this gives us precious time . . . 6-8 years to prevent that disease!Additionally, it is documented that the mutation of a gene known as MTHFR effects the methylation and thus detoxification pathways in the human body. Published literature has established a firm connection between toxins and breast cancer.  Thus, our goal is to identify a connection between the MTHFR gene mutation and a higher risk for breast cancer.  From there, we can illustrate how the diagnostic exam can be utilized as a tool primarily for the detection and augmentation of risk factors and to implement a nutritional protocol to reduce modifiable risks for having this gene mutation and potentially reduce the risks for breast cancer.METHODOLOGY AND YOUR HELPIf you will help me raise $315,000, we can conduct pioneering research, working with 100 women at our Long Island facility during the initial 18 months of this study.  Using the non-invasive Breast Thermography, we will identify the prevalence of the MTHFR gene mutation in “high risk” women, further identify gene mutation and the link to increased risk, and implement holistic nutritional and lifestyle adjustments that will avoid toxins.  The prevention protocol will incorporate the synergistic effect of Iodine, Vitamin D, Boswellia Sacra, an anti-inflammatory diet, breast self-exam, and stress relief. Our hypothesis is that we will be able to demonstrate how reversing basic nutritional deficiencies and simple life style changes in these high risk women can reduce risk.We want to empower women to minimize their own risks of breast cancer.PARTNERSHIP George Einstein, PhD, DSc HC is my PhD mentor. Dr. Einstein is a Distinguished Professor of Biophysics and Director of Einstein Research Foundation at Einstein Medical Institute, USAT Montserrat. Dr. Einstein has a distinguished international career in teaching and research. He is former US Navy scholar and consultant for NASA and the Tennessee Valley Authority. He has taught courses in engineering, mathematics and physics in the USA since 1986. He also served as a Visiting Associate Professor for the University in Poland and Thailand. His research interests include: medical treatment instrumentation, biophotonics matrix treatment and coherence bio-communication, medical treatment robotics, rehabilitation robotics, assistive technology robotics, environmental robotics and algorithmic & heuristic models for problem solving. Dr. Einstein is passionate about preventative medicine. YOUR INVESTMENT CAN CHANGE LIVESIf we are right, we will show that breast cancer is not a ticking time bomb waiting around the next turn of a woman's life.Women will know that their fate is their own.We will show that there are many things women can do to protect themselves and their breasts from this disease, and that there are options other than prophylactic mastectomies to prevent breast cancer.Equally important, this research could help physicians realize that non-invasive tools are available to them and their patients that will identify women at increased risk and recommend the use of natural nutritional protocols to decrease the risk of this disease.The outcome of this research could spark a preventative revolution in medicine.  I need you in this fight with me.  If you have ever lost someone you loved to cancer or if you yourself have ever had to endure those three horrific words “you have cancer,” help me fight.We can change the paradigm.  We can save lives.  I see it every day in my practice. I know the power of prevention and empowerment in healing.  I just need the data to prove it to the world.Join me.  Together we can change the face of medicine.Kristine Blanche, RPA-CFounder, Integrative Health SolutionsPhD CandidateListen to Kristine on the pod cast interview talking about this research:Part 1 - Interview on this research with John Cote on HealthcareElsewhere.comPart 2 - Interview with John Cote on HealthcareElsewhere.comCheck out our press Release!Check out a real patient testimonial video herePod cast interview with Jen Julius",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE!



THE PURPOSE OF THE HYDRO-TRANSPAK:
We want to help women and children transport water, from schools or other water sources, to their homes in a more safe, comfortable and timely manner.
The Hydro-TransPak is a new and innovative wearable water carrying device, that will allow one to carry water longer distances and in a more safe and comfortable manner as the weight of the water is evenly distributed throughout one's body.The Hydro-TransPak is versatile, allowing the user to wear the pack as a double pack or a single pack.
The Double Pack:

Wearing the Hydro-TransPak as a double pack, will allow the user to carry a maximum of 4 gallons of water. Simply attach the two smaller straps with the yellow coded female fasteners to the yellow color coded male end fasteners, Fill the  pack with water, roll the top of the pack down three times, connect the top and drape the pack over your shoulders. Total weight: 4 gallons of water = 33.4 pounds.

The Single Pack:

Wearing the Hydro-TransPak in single pack mode will allow the user to carry a maximum of 2 gallons of water. To use the Hydro-TransPak as a single pack, simply attach the two longer straps to the appropriate color coded fasteners, fill the pack with water, roll the top of the pack down three times, connect the top and wear the pack as you would a school backpack. Total weight: 2 gallons of water = 16.7 pounds. Wearing the pack in this method is ideal for smaller children that cannot handle very much weight.

The Effects of Head-Loading:
   In 2010 a study was conducted by the Environmental Health Journal. According to the study: Water carrying was mainly performed by women or children carrying containers on their head.  This method is know as, ""Head-Loading.""During the study: The containers used, typically weighed 43 pounds and were carried over a distance of a 1/4 mile. Due to the ""Head-Loading"" method, 69% of the participants in the study reported spinal pain in their neck and back, while 38% reported pain in their backs only.

The Hard Reality:

Head loading can lead to Musculoskeletal Disorders and other physical injuries.
Women and children in water-stressed regions walk on average 3.5 miles everyday to get water to their homes.
On average women and children travel 3 times per day to collect water.
Due to the distance one may have to travel to get clean water one may be tempted to stop at the closest water source, which may be a contaminated pond, river or swamp.


Many of the items used to carry clean drinking water are worn-out jerry cans, discarded clay pots and contaminated buckets that originally carried fuel, oils, pesticides, paints and other chemicals.WHO WE ARE:

<p><strong>As many of you may or may not know, our dear friend Victor has been in the Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital for about 6 weeks with a rare blood disease that unfortunately took quite a while to be diagnosed.  During that time, he has been in and out of ICU, suffered a few mini strokes and has continued to fight hard and defy the odds, every step of the way, largely due to the immeasurable and unwavering support of Jay Becker and prayers from friends and family. </strong></p>
<p><strong>  Although Victor is receiving the best care possible from the amazing doctors and nurses at the hospital and is responding well to the treatment, he still doesn't have Health Insurance and the bills are mounting.   </strong></p>

<p><strong>Victor's amazing mom, sister Cathy and brother James have been handling many of his expenses, but the time has come for outside assistance.   </strong></p>
<p><strong>The treatment that he is receiving may keep him in the hospital for many more weeks and during this time he is obviously not able to work and earn the money necessary to continue to pay his rent and utilities. Even after he is finally released from the hospital (which we hope will be soon) he will be recovering and still may not be able to work for a while. This is why your donation will help more than you’ll ever know. </strong></p>

<p><strong>How?   </strong></p>
<p><strong>We have set up this Indiegogo account as a way to help raise funds for his medical bills as well as his everyday living expenses while he is still in the hospital as well as after. Indiegogo is a crowd funding website that allows everyday people the opportunity to set up a campaign to raise funds for a cause. In this case it is our amazing friend Victor.   </strong></p>
<p><strong>By giving through Indiegogo, you are giving Victor and his family some financial breathing room and alleviating some of the mental stress from being in a hospital that may be weighing on him (Even though he'll never let it show).  </strong></p>

<div> </div>
<div>Grace Waite and her twin sister, Gloria, were born on April 17, 1947 in Cleveland, OH.  They were the youngest of ten children of Parents, Anne Marie and Montrose Waite.  In 1948 the family made its second pilgrimage to Liberia as missionary ambassadors for Antioch Baptist Church.  Grace loved having spent her formulative years “on The Continent.”  The family returned to Cleveland in March of 1954.</div>
<div>
<p>As an adolescent, Grace was initially confused by the goings on of the Civil Rights Movement in America, having been raised in a predominantly Black, African nation under a Black governing body.  As she gained further understanding though, Grace became angry and passionate about the Struggle and watched with fascination as it unfolded during her teenage years.</p>
<p>On January 28, 1967 Grace Waite wed Richard E. Jones.  The Draft sent Richard to Vietnam before the birth of their only child, Richard E. Jones Jr. whom Grace’s twin sister, Gloria affectionately nicknamed Asante, which means “thank you” in Swahili, the common tongue of the native Liberians.  The new nomenclature stuck.</p>
<p>Grace and Richard divorced in 1970 and she found employment with the Call &amp; Post Newspaper covering the entertainment beat.  Grace interviewed such notable acts as Earth, Wind and Fire, Stevie Wonder and the Harlem Globetrotters in their 1970s heyday.  Afterwards she worked for boxing promoter Don King as his first secretary upon his release from prison. </p>
<p>In 1974 Grace went to a screening of a documentary short film titled, “Last Grave at Dimbaza.”  Shot in secret, the film was smuggled out of South Africa during the Apartheid era.  The film’s unabashed display of the evils of Apartheid made a lasting impression on her that would set her on an entirely new path.  In 1976 a group of Black South African schoolchildren decided to demonstrate against the racist regime in Soweto, South Africa.  South African police opened fire on the children and massacred several hundred of them.  To which Grace angrily queried, “What if one of them had been my son?”</p>
<p>Thereafter Grace Waite Jones quite famously went about organizing demonstrations and rallies on the streets of Cleveland to draw focus to a tremendous injustice taking place half a world away.  From the forefront of the Anti-Apartheid Movement she joined her voice with others on a national scale to raise American awareness of the inequities of Apartheid.  By the early 80s Grace was a professional social activist, getting paid for speaking engagements on the subject of not only Apartheid but racial disproportions right here in America.</p>
<p>She remained fervently on this path until Nelson Mandela was released from Robben Island Prison in 1990.  In 1994, Grace traveled to South Africa as a delegate for The Africa Fund to oversee the elections process and helped to insure Mandela’s overwhelming appointment to the office of President of South Africa.  She viewed this as her crowning achievement.</p>
<p>Subsequently Grace opted out of the hustle and bustle of social activism and focused wholly on her family.  After her twin sister, Gloria succumbed to breast cancer in 2000, Grace filled her days quietly gardening in her yard on Cleveland’s east side.  She organized neighbors to get to the polls in large numbers in 2008 and 2012, making multiple trips to drive them herself.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, November 27, 2012, Grace Waite Jones passed away in her home.  She is survived by her four brothers, Robert (Joan), Jimmy, David and Paul and her son, Asante (Kelli), a host of nieces, nephews, great nieces &amp; nephews and 3 grandkids by proxy....  She impacted the world on both a global scale and an individual basis.  Though gone from us now, her indelible mark on the world will not soon be forgotten.</p>
<p>The Memorial Service for Grace Waite Jones will be held on Saturday December 8, 2012 @ 1PM at Lucas Memorial Chapel, 9010 Garfield Blvd., Garfield Hts., OH 44125.</p>

A more severe form of Stevens Johnson Syndrome. I was 34 years of age at the time. My son was 8.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>SJS/TEN is a severe life threatening allergic reaction which is usually caused by certain pharmaceutical medications. Mainly Pennicillins, Sulpha medications, some anti-convulsants, as well as some mainstream pain relievers. Mine was caused by an anti-convulsant I was taking to control Juvenille Myoclonic seizures as well as Absence seizures. I was given a 50/50% chance of surviving, having blistered and burnt over 60% of my bodies surface. I spent a little over a month in a Burn Unit, receiving iVIG treatment for my condition. I spent 4 weeks in a drug-induced coma, and another few weeks simply healing and receiving physical therapy in order to get back walking again.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This condition also caused me to lose half my hair, my fingernails, and my toenails. I suffered liver damage which lasted a year in entirety. Today; TEN has left me with dry eye syndrome, Interstitial lung disease, photo-sensitivity, anxiety, scarring of my esophagus, as well as increased sensitivity to other medications.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In essence with SJS/TEN, your body is unable to metabolize the offending medication. So it distributes it under the skin. (Hence the name: Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. aka: Skin death.) Once under your skin, it causes the patient to ""burn from the inside out."" Developing severe blistering, sloughing of layers of epidermis; leaving the patient of increased risk of sepsis, pneumonia, as well as other infections and death. I firmly believe that patients who survive this ordeal, give all new meaning to the term ""Survivor.""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There are many other after-effects I haven't listed here. I only listed what I have been effected with. Some patients lose their ability to see, others have GI issues, the list is endless it seems.

A group of people who walk/run the marathon to raise awareness of SJS/TEN. Some members of this team are survivors themselves, and some are family/friends/supporters of survivors. The day I was invited, was truly an honor. My son and I walking with fellow survivors, raising awareness, and bringing a little bit of Saskatchewan to Wisconsin!</p>

</div><div>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>From a personal perspective, I see a tremendous impact being had on my son and myself; as well as some of the survivors we will be meeting in Wisconsin. Many I have met through Facebook, and have been a huge support for myself and my son over the three years since my hospitalization in the Burn Unit. I feel this will be a very cathartic as well as therapeutic experience for all of us whom are involved. Putting a real time face to the name. Spending ""real-time"" with our support system a country away. It will truly be an experience of a lifetime, and one my son and I won't soon forget.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If our campaign doesn't happen, then we simply miss out on what I feel would be an extremely healing experience emotionally for both my son and myself. I have yet to talk to or meet anyone in my home city, let alone province; who has experienced the hell of TEN, and the after effects it can bring. Meeting others who understand first hand what life is like post-SJS/TEN would be an amazing experience to say the least!</p>

<p>Jaden and I are looking at $1,450.00 in travel costs to make this goal a reality. If we succeed in our fundraising goal; we have the opportunity to meet fellow survivors and their families. As well as raise awareness on this under-diagnosed and life threatening disease, which affects 100,000 people each and every year.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Monies donated to this cause, will cover our flight only. If we exceed our fundraising goal of $750.00, anything over and above will be donated to the Stevens Johnson Syndrome Foundation.

<h3>About Liam!</h3>
<p>Liam was born December 29, 2011 to his amazing mommy and daddy, Erica and Andrew. Liam's start to life wasn't easy with two fractured legs, so he spent his newborn days in casts. Now that he's older, they have more of an understanding of what he has, but still no real idea of how Liam's mobility will be impacted.</p>
<p>Liam was born with a rare disorder called Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita in his lower extremities.  Arthrogryposis or AMC for short.  He also has Muscular Dystrophy in his lower extremities. Clubbed feet that was finally corrected on Sept. 14th 2012.  And finally bilateral (both sides) Hip Dysplasia. </p>
<p>We're not sure if Liam will be able to crawl or walk, so your generous gift will help towards Liam's mobility!!</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Since Liam doesn't have use of his legs to walk, this little guy needs a way to get around. The ZipZac is a small seat with wheels (it looks like a mini wheelchair!!) that will allow Liam the freedom and mobility to explore and be a child!</p>
<p>Read more about the ZipZac here!! <a href=""http://www.zipzac.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zipzac.com</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As an almost one year old, it would be so amazing for Liam to be able to explore his surroundings and be a mobile child! I know this would be an absolutely amazing gift for Liam.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute, spread the word! Maybe this campaign will help to raise awareness for AMC!</p>
<p>Also pray! Praying can be so powerful, so is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>And finally, even if our goal isn't reached, Liam is facing some large medical bills now and in the future! Every little bit helps!</p>

Here are some ways to measure safe levels of radiation that occur naturally in these various environments:</p><ul>
<li>During air travel, you can measure the increase in background radiation as the plane increases altitude.</li>
<li>When visiting antique shops, it can be used to determine if uranium glass is authentic or not.</li>
<li>You can take measurements on granite counter-tops to see their elevated level and find possible uranium hot spots.</li>
<li>If you travel to a potentially contaminated area, you could scan food before eating it and scan your clothing and shoes to make sure they were not contaminated.</li>

Here is a summary:</p><p><strong>1) The mushroom cloud imagery is a bit over the top.</strong></p><p>The mushroom cloud image can rub people the wrong way. But it is timely. According to some analysts, there is about a 20% per year probability that a nuke will be used somewhere. This is not necessarily a nuclear Armageddon, but not an insignificant event either. For a really good discussion on this please see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW7IgKJWtqk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW7IgKJWtqk</a> . This is a 2008 TED event, and does not include some of the more recent threats. </p><p>For some people, spending $200 as a precaution on an instrument that tells them if they need to wash their hands or change their contaminated clothes is not unreasonable. If you wait until you need it, it will be too late.</p><p>The CT007F has a wide range of uses, going from the worst case scenario, to transport accidents, to just educating yourself by measuring natural radiation all around you. We tried to be reasonably balanced in our description. Whether or not we have succeeded will depend on your perspective.</p><p><strong>2) To allow alpha particles into the sensor, the Mylar cover has to be thin. Wouldn’t that make the CT007F just as fragile as a pancake tube based detector?</strong></p><p>No. The actual sensor is a solid. Therefore, changes in air pressure will not put stress on our Mylar and there is no tube to pop. </p><p>Even if you do stick a pin through the Mylar (which isn't easy to do with the aluminum slider), you have a light leak but have not totally destroyed the instrument (unlike a pancake). You just have to keep light from shining through the hole and the instrument will still work. You can put a piece of tape over the entire window, and you still see beta and gamma. With a hole in a pancake, you see nothing! Also, with some skill and manual dexterity, you can put a drop of paint or black silicone on the pin hole and you end up with a tiny spot that is blind to alpha, but otherwise everything still works. Try that with a pancake!</p><p><strong>3) How does the sensitivity compare with a pancake based detector like the CT007P?</strong></p><p>Both the CT007F and CT007P will detect almost all charged particles that enter them. The P has about 3 times the detection area. So, if you put both on a distributed source (e.g. a bag of KCl salt substitute), the P will read about 3 times the CPM. If you put them both on a point source (e.g. the alpha source from a smoke detector), they will read about the same. For typical gamma (Cs-137, natural background etc.), the efficiencies are also more or less proportional to the surface area. We are planning to send a couple of units out this week for a Cs-137 calibration.<br/><br/>For a contamination meter, you want to have the gamma sensitivity fairly low, so that you can still detect surface contamination (alpha, beta) without getting swamped by gamma background. As shown in our video (see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VATv9ls0L9w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VATv9ls0L9w</a> ), the CT007F works well detecting small amounts of contamination, without getting swamped by background gamma radiation.</p><p>One thing CT007F users may notice if they are used to pancake type detectors, is that the sensitivity of the F to very low energy gamma radiation is quite low. For example, you won't measure anything above background on the outside of a smoke detector (60 keV gamma), while the P does respond to that. The F does respond to 60 keV gamma, but the efficiency is low. Pancake type detectors tend to over-respond to low energy gamma rays, considering the fact that these carry very little radiation dose. Of course, both the P and the F will easily detect the alpha particles from an exposed smoke detector source.</p><p><strong>4) The constant beeping would annoy me. Can the beeps be turned off?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can turn off the local buzzer through the settings menu of the Android app. The app also allows you to play the beeps (or any alarms you set through the app) through ear buds. </p><p><strong>5) I want to go prospecting for Rare Earth deposits, and I need to be able to detect tiny changes in background radiation. Is the CT007F the best instrument for this?</strong></p><p>No. If you want to get very high sensitivity in a small instrument, consider the CT007N (AKA NanoNuke). See video here <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIXLUSOqPUk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIXLUSOqPUk</a> . The NanoNuke does not detect alpha/beta contamination.</p><p><strong>6) Does the CT007F do the same thing as a $50 000 instrument?</strong></p><p>Probably not. There are special purpose instruments that are better at a particular purpose. </p><p>The CT007F is the best, most practical, general purpose radiation detector. It detects both ambient gamma and alpha/beta contamination. It is small, light weight, rugged and affordable. </p></div>","IntroductionThe CT007F is the most practical and economical way to measure radioactive contamination.

We are planning to send a couple of units out this week for a Cs-137 calibration.For a contamination meter, you want to have the gamma sensitivity fairly low, so that you can still detect surface contamination (alpha, beta) without getting swamped by gamma background. As shown in our video (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VATv9ls0L9w ), the CT007F works well detecting small amounts of contamination, without getting swamped by background gamma radiation.One thing CT007F users may notice if they are used to pancake type detectors, is that the sensitivity of the F to very low energy gamma radiation is quite low. For example, you won't measure anything above background on the outside of a smoke detector (60 keV gamma), while the P does respond to that. The F does respond to 60 keV gamma, but the efficiency is low. Pancake type detectors tend to over-respond to low energy gamma rays, considering the fact that these carry very little radiation dose. Of course, both the P and the F will easily detect the alpha particles from an exposed smoke detector source.4) The constant beeping would annoy me. Can the beeps be turned off?Yes, you can turn off the local buzzer through the settings menu of the Android app. The app also allows you to play the beeps (or any alarms you set through the app) through ear buds. 5) I want to go prospecting for Rare Earth deposits, and I need to be able to detect tiny changes in background radiation. Is the CT007F the best instrument for this?No. If you want to get very high sensitivity in a small instrument, consider the CT007N (AKA NanoNuke). See video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIXLUSOqPUk . The NanoNuke does not detect alpha/beta contamination.6) Does the CT007F do the same thing as a $50 000 instrument?Probably not. There are special purpose instruments that are better at a particular purpose. The CT007F is the best, most practical, general purpose radiation detector. It detects both ambient gamma and alpha/beta contamination. It is small, light weight, rugged and affordable.",12.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h2>Our Story </h2>
<p>Why do we drink juice, soda or anything else we know isn't the best for our health? Taste. This is why we created Pressa Bottle. A portable way to extract flavor from fruit into your water. There are obvious health concerns to drinking soda and juice but instead of concocting a low cal, detox-skinny tea with anti-aging benefits ""that tastes great"" (pff!), we decided to simplify and create a product to flavor water naturally.</p>
<p>Pressa Bottle was created by 3 brothers; Jesse, Luke and Mason and was created as an alternative to all the (expensive) sugary drinks we were putting back in College. Since our original prototype we've come a long way and are on our way to fill our initial Kicksarter order shortly. </p>

Not posing for a camera, but with all the expressions of joy and surprise you have as you actually live your life.<br/>BLINCAM is more than a gadget to us. It’s about remembering the world in an entirely new way.<br/><br/>Have you ever noticed that people in pictures from the 1800s are never smiling? The camera technology from those days meant they had to sit still for 15 minutes or more for a single picture, so it was too hard to smile for that long. As a result, the happiness of an entire era of people has been lost with time.<br/><br/>Today we can capture smiles, but we rarely capture moments. Our phones, snug in our pockets, capture only the planned, the posed, the expected. They capture the action as it passes us by, having stepped to the side to take out our phones and line up a shot. They miss when your friend laughs so hard that milk comes out his nose. They miss the tears in your lover’s eyes when you pull out a ring and ask her to marry you. They miss when the baby in your arms wakes up to your face and laughs.<br/><br/>Our backers will be the first to capture these moments, to forever preserve the special moments in their lives the way they really saw them.

I live outside of United States. Will you ship to my country?</strong><br/>Sure! We ship worldwide so won't be a problem.</p><p><strong>Q. Can I wear BLINCAM with sunglasses?</strong><br/>Absolutely yes!</p><p><strong>Q. What glasses can I attach BLINCAM to?</strong><br/>The product comes with three attachments used to attach to glasses. These will allow you to attach BLINCAM to most standard glasses. There is a possibility that it may not fit glasses with a unique temple size that is very thin or thick.</p><p><strong>Q. Isn’t this product heavy?</strong><br/>The product weighs in at 25 grams (about 5 coins) and is designed to be so light that you won’t notice it.</p><p><strong>Q. How accurate is the wink detection?</strong><br/>Tests have confirmed over 90% accuracy with the current prototype, and virtually no delay between the wink and the picture. We plan to continue testing and calibrating the device further before it ships.</p><p><strong>Q. Does the device mistake normal blinking for shutter snapping?</strong><br/>BLINCAM features a sensor that is tuned to not detect ordinary blinking, so it should not misfire. However, there may be cases (about 10%) where it mistakes normal blinking for a shutter snap.</p><p><strong>Q. I’m not good at winking. Can I still take photos?</strong><br/>Instead of winking, you can simply close both eyes firmly to take a photo as well.</p><p><strong>Q. How do I align the focus?</strong><br/>The BLINCAM features a fixed focus and is designed to be in focus in most cases. You cannot focus on specific objects or subjects or intentionally blur the background.</p><p><strong>Q. What about photo blur from vibrations?</strong><br/>The BLINCAM does not feature a blur correction feature. If engaged in intense movement, the photos produced will be like those taken on a smartphone in equivalent circumstances. We suggest stopping your movement before taking a photo.</p><p><strong>Q. Can the BLINCAM take videos?</strong><br/>The BLINCAM only takes still photos. If there is sufficient demand, we may consider adding video in the future.</p><p><strong>Q. The battery life is listed as eight hours on standby. How long will it last when in use?</strong><br/>While it varies by the volume of photos you take, we estimate about four hours.</p><p><br/><strong><u>About the app:</u></strong></p><p><strong>Q. Do I have to have the app to use BLINCAM?</strong><br/>No. The device can be attached to a computer via a Micro USB cable to transfer data directly. The files will be browsed in the same fashion as when you insert an SD card or other external media in your computer.</p><p><strong>Q. Can BLINCAM be used on iOS and Android?</strong><br/>Yes, it supports both systems. Please refer to the Specs document for supported devices and OSes.</p><p><strong>Q. Can BLINCAM be used with feature phones?</strong><br/>Unfortunately, the system does not support feature phones.<br/> </p><p><strong><u>Usage environment:</u></strong></p><p><strong>Q.

Not posing for a camera, but with all the expressions of joy and surprise you have as you actually live your life.After one year of effort, it is a reality.By using BLINCAM to snap photos of your children, you won’t get posed, unnatural photos -- you can capture them in the candid moment.BLINCAM is a tool designed to let you capture life as it happens.While posed photos with the framing carefully planned are also nice, don’t you want to capture the world before you as you see it? This special camera is designed to let you capture those magic moments.How you use it is, of course, up to you.When you catch your family and friends off-guard making an interesting expression or you see a touching scene, whipping out your smartphone to take a pic will be too late.By the time you’re ready, the moment will have passed. Children grow up very fast. Each and every instance is a precious memory. You can’t let those valuable shutter opportunities go by.But with BLINCAM, you will never let the moment pass.You catch a great view as you ride your bike--snap!Your hands are busy as you cook a meal. Snapping a pic is no problem!Your hands are full of luggage on a trip. Now you can snap a pic!When watching a sporting event, you don’t want to have your eyes glued to your smartphone -- you want to be able to look up and enjoy the game with your own eyes. In these cases, too... Snap!- Use casually and coollyBLINCAM is committed to producing a device that simply attaches to your glasses. We didn’t want to make a massive, multi-function pair of goggles that was expensive. We wanted a more simple and intuitive design that could be used by people everywhere. The product is just 25 grams in weight (about 5 coins), meaning it can be attached to your glasses without discomfort.We believe that wearable devices should be an extension of fashion. Giant, science-fiction esque devices or helmet-like gadgets can really spoil your looks. We have aimed to create a product that feels at home on your face and that has a UX as simple as it feels. Getting started:
Download the BLINCAM app and sign up
Follow the instructions to pair BLINCAM to your smartphone over Bluetooth
Attach the BLINCAM
Follow the guidance to begin calibration *You will be asked to slowly adjust the position of the BLINCAM while blinking several times and finding the best position for you.
You’re finished!
Usage:
Put on your glasses.
Set the BLINCAM switch to the on position and attach to your glasses.*It will automatically pair with your smartphone.
Wink to snap a photograph.*A shutter sound confirms that you’ve taken a picture.
Launch the smartphone app.
Photos are displayed in the order taken; simply flick with your thumb to sort.
Attach the device to your smartphone over USB to mass copy photos.

Our video hit more than 10M views on CNBC!!  Since we hit our goal of $30,000, you can choose from five colors; black, white, blue, pink or green! After the campaign we’ll send you an email asking what color you’d prefer.All purchase through Indiegogo are scheduled to be delivered in April 2017!We're a team of dreamers, designers, engineers and problem solvers. Our goal is to help people to enjoy their life with our technologies and ideas!The company was founded out of a simple idea--wouldn't it be great if we could snap photos of our families and friends when they’re acting naturally? Not posing for a camera, but with all the expressions of joy and surprise you have as you actually live your life.BLINCAM is more than a gadget to us. It’s about remembering the world in an entirely new way.Have you ever noticed that people in pictures from the 1800s are never smiling? The camera technology from those days meant they had to sit still for 15 minutes or more for a single picture, so it was too hard to smile for that long. As a result, the happiness of an entire era of people has been lost with time.Today we can capture smiles, but we rarely capture moments. Our phones, snug in our pockets, capture only the planned, the posed, the expected. They capture the action as it passes us by, having stepped to the side to take out our phones and line up a shot. They miss when your friend laughs so hard that milk comes out his nose. They miss the tears in your lover’s eyes when you pull out a ring and ask her to marry you. They miss when the baby in your arms wakes up to your face and laughs.Our backers will be the first to capture these moments, to forever preserve the special moments in their lives the way they really saw them. All it will take is a blink to let you, your friends, your children, and even people hundreds of years from now step into your life during your happiest moments.We invite you to make history with us. About the product:Q. I live outside of United States. Will you ship to my country?Sure! We ship worldwide so won't be a problem.Q. Can I wear BLINCAM with sunglasses?Absolutely yes!Q. What glasses can I attach BLINCAM to?The product comes with three attachments used to attach to glasses. These will allow you to attach BLINCAM to most standard glasses. There is a possibility that it may not fit glasses with a unique temple size that is very thin or thick.Q. Isn’t this product heavy?The product weighs in at 25 grams (about 5 coins) and is designed to be so light that you won’t notice it.Q. How accurate is the wink detection?Tests have confirmed over 90% accuracy with the current prototype, and virtually no delay between the wink and the picture. We plan to continue testing and calibrating the device further before it ships.Q. Does the device mistake normal blinking for shutter snapping?BLINCAM features a sensor that is tuned to not detect ordinary blinking, so it should not misfire. However, there may be cases (about 10%) where it mistakes normal blinking for a shutter snap.Q. I’m not good at winking. Can I still take photos?Instead of winking, you can simply close both eyes firmly to take a photo as well.Q. How do I align the focus?The BLINCAM features a fixed focus and is designed to be in focus in most cases. You cannot focus on specific objects or subjects or intentionally blur the background.Q. What about photo blur from vibrations?The BLINCAM does not feature a blur correction feature. If engaged in intense movement, the photos produced will be like those taken on a smartphone in equivalent circumstances. We suggest stopping your movement before taking a photo.Q. Can the BLINCAM take videos?The BLINCAM only takes still photos. If there is sufficient demand, we may consider adding video in the future.Q. The battery life is listed as eight hours on standby. How long will it last when in use?While it varies by the volume of photos you take, we estimate about four hours.About the app:Q. Do I have to have the app to use BLINCAM?No. The device can be attached to a computer via a Micro USB cable to transfer data directly. The files will be browsed in the same fashion as when you insert an SD card or other external media in your computer.Q. Can BLINCAM be used on iOS and Android?Yes, it supports both systems. Please refer to the Specs document for supported devices and OSes.Q. Can BLINCAM be used with feature phones?Unfortunately, the system does not support feature phones. Usage environment:Q. Can the BLINCAM be used overseas?Yes. Note that connections to web sites and the cloud depend on your particular Internet connection. Miscellaneous:Q. PrivacyBLINCAM should not be used in public locations or other venues where it would infringe on the privacy of others. The video includes a scene of a user winking at a cafe, but the BLINCAM was originally developed to let you take photos of your private moments with your family and when engaging in your personal hobbies.

GAIANS....WHAT IS THE MATTER?? 
The deadline for this campain is running out in less than 2 Days!! 
BUT DENISE, HER FUZZ KIDS ARE STILL STUCK

Our friend is going through a bit of a nightmare recently due to issues with her 
husband. She lives in Japan because her husband works for the Military and was then 
based in Japan. Upon her time in Japan our friend became the owner of eight dogs 
which she rescued from the street in a cruel scenario. These dogs are her children, 
there is nothing more important to her in the world. Four of the dogs are now in 
America with the husband as he moved away from Japan which is all part of the 
troubling issues our friend is going through. Apart from a really bad health, caused from 
stress , asthma and different allergies the four dogs that are left, are all she 
has left in the world and she needs to somehow get these four wonderful creatures 
with her back to Germany (Her home country) or to get settled in Okinawa to start making a living & provide for herself & the Fuzzes!
consequences of leaving these dogs in Japan are worse than you'd every think. I 
won't go into that much detail as to what could happen to four dogs who are left to 
a shelter. To move four dogs across the world, it doesn't come cheap. There are 
many phases of the process that need to be done carefully and so the extravagent 
prices get worse and worse. Although it is a large amount of money, it is extremely 
worth it to get these dogs to a safe home where they can continue their lives with 
their true owner. The money so kindly given will go towards vetenary sessions which 
are compulsary and also the actual flight to get them and her away to safety. 
We did contact the embassy about her situation, but they are not really qucik in making 
decisions or borrowing money for a plane ticket, so that we need to be worried, that her 
health issues will be worse. The only things the embassy offered till now are 2000 
japanes yen, which is as much as 15 Euros. Also they did send her a lost of homeless
people places.
AT THIS POINT SHE IS HOMELES!! Selling her equiptment to provide for a roof in the limited accamodations.
We really do appreciate any amount of money given as each penny is a step further 
towards the end of this disaster.

<h3>I am a male in a female body who just wants to be comfortable with who they are and how they look. For as long as I remember I have never felt or been female at any point in my life. </h3>
<p>My campaign is about helping me look how I feel. I am saving up funds to pay the full amount up front and to confirm a date to get my Top Surgery; otherwise known as a bilateral mastectomy. This surgery removes my breast tissue via incisions and the surgeons will contour my chest and nipples to a more masculine shape that better represent who I am on the inside. This surgery is important to me because I want to look how I feel. I am a man trapped with a woman's body and I don't want to give up on life simply because I do not look how I should! I am a strong dude with a passion for life and I will not give up on my campaign until I have reached my goal. I will not give up just because I cannot get health insurance due to birth defects and other health conditions, and instead will keep fighting for my much needed surgery no matter how long it takes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Surgery, painkillers/anti-biotics and post-op check-ups and revisions</li>
<li>Anaesthetist which is not included in surgery costs</li>
<li>Hospital stay for up to 2 nights</li>
<li>Any travel costs such as petrol, or inter-island flights</li>
<li>2-4 weeks off of work to recover and heal before returning; this includes bills, rent, food and petrol cover over that period off work.</li>
</ol><p>Any excess funding will be going to a trust fund that helps other transgender FtM and MtF reach their top surgery goals. Effectively by helping me you are helping the rest of the transgender populace reach their goals as well. If I reach my goal, the entire surgery, anaesthetic, and hospital costs will be put down to confirm a surgery date within the next year, and to pay 2-4 weeks worth of rent, bills, food and petrol. If I do not reach my goal, I will put the entire amount into a locked savings account and will continually be adding to that account via continued use of IndieGoGo, Kickstarter and GoFundMe as well as the savings from my own job until I reach the full amount to do the same as above. I am going as far as selling anything that is not necessary when it comes to personal belongings, I feel that I can always get these items back in the future but for now I am focusing on my life and making myself comfortable with my body!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a physical therapist (Cindy) from the US trying to help my Haitian friend Ivens, who is a PT (and OT) and his colleagues realize their dream of providing a rehabilitation and health center (FONHARE) in northern Haiti, raise awareness about disability in Haiti and the efforts there to change the lives of those, especially children, living with disabilities.</p>
<p> The Haitian Foundation of Rehabilitation (FONHARE) is a not-for-profit organization NGO, dedicated to providing humanitarian rehabilitation services to the poorest people with disabilities in Haiti.  A year and a half after the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti thousands of children, youth and elderly are living with physical disabilities but they have nowhere to receive comprehensive rehabilitation services to improve their quality of life and integrate themselves into society. Specifically in northern Haiti, many disabled people have been moved to that region after the earthquake.  Until FONHARE there weren’t any Rehab Services where they could receive comprehensive care for the recovery of their disabilities and injuries to improve their quality of life and reintegrate them into society. Thus they remain a perpetual drain for the family. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our first goal is to raise $12,000 for the salaries of a physical therapist and a physical therapy technician for one year.  Ivens has been working 16 hour days and cannot continue this pace.  One Haitian physical therapist who is currently working in the DR is willing to come back to Haiti and work for basic expenses of $600 per month.  A physical therapy technician salary is $400 per month.  $12000 will cover these two salaries for one year. </p>
<p> Please help us make FONHARE successful in it's mission by contributing towards these salaries! </p>
<p>Any funds raised over and above the salaries will go toward the purchase of a portable x-ray machine for the health center.  If the $12000 goal is not reached for salaries, the funds raised will still go toward the salary of additional help at the clinic.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since the earthquake, money has been donated to various causes in Haiti, but often gets lost in bureaucracy and/or the administration budgets of large organizations and never reaches the people and places it was intended for.  This is a chance to help bring about real and lasting change, help build the infrastructure in Haiti, and support Haitians where they live and work.</p>
<p>It is also an opportunity to support enormous change in a culture that devalues people with disability - a chance to help alleviate misery and give some real hope to those who have no one to stand up for them.</p>
<p>Hopefully, many donators will contribute to this cause and word will spread that there are great things happening in Haiti!</p>
<p>Show  solidarity and promote Haitian endeavors that are building up the lives of the most oppressed and disadvantaged!</p>

<p><strong>My name is Rosemary Velez and I am the mother of 13 year old Michael Santiago. When Michael was born he was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. The disease was so severe that many doctors did not give my son a chance to see his teen years. But as he grew his desire to fight and live on grew with him. There are many things that most 13 years old have been blessed to do on an everyday basis that Michael does not get to do. Michael is stricken to a wheel chair for the rest of his life, he cannot feed himself neither can he play outside with peers his age but his smile and his ability to win always gives us hope of better days ahead. </strong></p>
<p><strong>But through all the struggles and sleepless nights I along with his father have always fought to treat Michael like everyone else and give him the life that one said he could never have.  One of the biggest struggles that we now face is the ever enduring task of taking care of a young teenage boy with limited resources to do the things necessary to give him as normal as life as possible. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We as a team are looking to purchase a van with a wheelchair lift installed to be able to do the things necessary to get Michael around. This is not an easy task because although he may not be able to do things on his own, his body continues to grow and grow more fragile. Transporting him in our current condition makes it hard on him and his health.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So we ask that you join us in this campaign to get Michael the help he deserves. God has truly blessed us with a miracle child. We hope that you be a blessing to us as much as he has been a blessing to all. </strong></p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis stops people from moving, and the National MS Society exists to make sure it doesn't. We believe that moving is not just something you can or can't do, but rather is who you are. This is why we host events like Bike MS -- to raise funds for critical research, as well as comprehensive programs and services for people with MS -- moving closer to a world free of MS. By working together, we can keep everyone moving forward.</p>
<p>For the past two years my twin 14 year old boys and I have done the ride together.  I personally have ridden the Bike MS since 2005 and have raised about $5000. The first year I rode I raised $1200 and about $600 each year after that.</p>
<p>We each would like to raise $1200 to be a “Top Banana.” A “Top Banana” is simply someone that raises $1200 or more. As an incentive they earn a special jersey. The funding we need is to sign up for the ride, pay for lodging, and raise a minimum amount of $300. Funds will go for: Registration: depending on when the registration happens it is $30 - $60 a person Minimum fund raising amount: $300 per person to ride (Minimum amount MUST be met to ride) Lodging: $30 per person (two nights in a cabin at Camp Kern)</p>
<p>ALL EXTRA FUNDS WILL GO TOWARDS MS RESEARCH</p>
<p>Because of the work of researchers around the world, thousands of people living with MS can manage their disease and live productive, active lives. Those we care about personally- our family and friends -can be optimistic about what the future holds for them and their children.  YOU are the research revolution, and NOW is the time for bold action.  </p>
<p>Your fundraising helps:</p>
<p>•STOP MS in its tracks  </p>
<p>•RESTORE function already lost to damage from MS  </p>
<p>•END MS forever, including protection for future generations</p>
<p>One of my co-workers has MS, another co-worker has a family friend with MS, and one of my aunts has a friend with MS. We ride for them. Chances are you either know someone or know someone that knows someone with MS.</p>
<p>Any amount will do. And if you can't donate spread the word with the Indiegogo share tools.</p>

For the past two years my twin 14 year old boys and I have done the ride together.  I personally have ridden the Bike MS since 2005 and have raised about $5000. The first year I rode I raised $1200 and about $600 each year after that.
We each would like to raise $1200 to be a “Top Banana.” A “Top Banana” is simply someone that raises $1200 or more. As an incentive they earn a special jersey. The funding we need is to sign up for the ride, pay for lodging, and raise a minimum amount of $300. Funds will go for: Registration: depending on when the registration happens it is $30 - $60 a person Minimum fund raising amount: $300 per person to ride (Minimum amount MUST be met to ride) Lodging: $30 per person (two nights in a cabin at Camp Kern)
ALL EXTRA FUNDS WILL GO TOWARDS MS RESEARCH
Because of the work of researchers around the world, thousands of people living with MS can manage their disease and live productive, active lives. Those we care about personally- our family and friends -can be optimistic about what the future holds for them and their children.  YOU are the research revolution, and NOW is the time for bold action.  
Your fundraising helps:
•STOP MS in its tracks  
•RESTORE function already lost to damage from MS  
•END MS forever, including protection for future generations
One of my co-workers has MS, another co-worker has a family friend with MS, and one of my aunts has a friend with MS. We ride for them. Chances are you either know someone or know someone that knows someone with MS.
Any amount will do. And if you can't donate spread the word with the Indiegogo share tools.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>Hi my name is Dane, welcome to Operation Brush's first fundraiser!  <br/></p>
<p>At the beginning of this year I had an idea to start a nonprofit that distributes biodegradable toothbrushes to underprivileged children all around the world. How or why did I decide on doing this you might be wondering?<br/></p>
<p>Well it all started with my twin cousins, age 6, doing a project for school. Their project was simple: raise money to purchase toothbrushes to send to El Salvadorian children in need (Sophia and Rody managed to get 700 toothbrushes in total!). When I heard about this project, it inspired me, so I did a little research... To my amazement I discovered that there are hundreds of MILLIONS of children all over the world that don't own a toothbrush and, like myself, you probably had no idea there were so many! </p>
<p>I knew that poor oral hygiene is directly related to devastating chronic illnesses, and other health problems, so I decided that I would help take on this huge global problem, like my 2 cousins had, but in a much bigger way.</p>
<p>(Sophia and Rody) </p>

<p>With the help of your donations we are going to buy biodegradable toothbrushes for the very first time, through our very new, and very unique, organization. </p>
<p>Operation Brush wants to change the lives of children around the world, and we need your help to help them! </p>
<p>By making a donation you are helping to improve the lives of children. In addition to giving these children in need the ability to eat without pain, preventing the loss of teeth, and decreasing their chances of developing chronic illnesses caused by poor oral hygiene, we are improving their overall health and happiness with the help of your donation! </p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It is easy to relate to a lot of charities you see out there in the world today, for example: almost everyone has, or knows someone that has battled some form of cancer. However in our case we have always owned a toothbrush, and everyone we have ever known has owned a toothbrush; so at first, this cause seems hard to understand. But when you really think about it, it's the easiest thing to understand, we've been brushing all our lives, multiple times a day! The reality unfortunately, is that most of the world doesn't see the devastating effects that poor oral hygiene has on individuals. </span></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>This cause impacts the lives of children whose families unfortunately can't provide this basic need to them. </p>

<p>We get asked a lot, ""Why biodegradable instead of plastic?"" That is a great question. </p>
<p>The places that we will be distributing to often do not have recycling, and even live near their landfills in some cases. It is VERY important to us that we respect both their environment, and their community while helping solve this global poor oral hygiene problem.<br/></p>
<p>In the United States alone an estimated 50 MILLION pounds of plastic from toothbrushes are thrown into landfills each year, and take up to 1,000 years to decompose. So by using biodegradable toothbrushes we help prevent further plastic pollution.</p>
<p>The biodegradable toothbrushes that we use are made from bamboo. This makes them a perfect fit because they are a natural antimicrobial, which means they fight off bacteria naturally! There are other great qualities of bamboo as well, like their ability to grow in nutrient poor soil, and they can grow up to a meter a day (that's over 3 feet!)</p>
<p>Here's a 24hr time lapse of bamboo growing, it truly is amazing how fast it can grow!</p>

</div><div><br/></div></div>","WE DID IT! With the help from all of you - we reached our GOAL!
Let's not stop here though! 
We have 1 week left in the fundraiser to raise additional funds! 
Ever dollar we raise over $3,500 will go towards buying more toothbrushes to help the millions of children in need throughout the world that suffer from poor oral hygiene.

***Words cannot express how thankful we are for your donations and support. Your contributions will truly make a big difference in the lives of children who need it the most.*** 

 
                    
Hi my name is Dane, welcome to Operation Brush's first fundraiser!  
At the beginning of this year I had an idea to start a nonprofit that distributes biodegradable toothbrushes to underprivileged children all around the world. How or why did I decide on doing this you might be wondering?
Well it all started with my twin cousins, age 6, doing a project for school. Their project was simple: raise money to purchase toothbrushes to send to El Salvadorian children in need (Sophia and Rody managed to get 700 toothbrushes in total!). When I heard about this project, it inspired me, so I did a little research... To my amazement I discovered that there are hundreds of MILLIONS of children all over the world that don't own a toothbrush and, like myself, you probably had no idea there were so many! 
I knew that poor oral hygiene is directly related to devastating chronic illnesses, and other health problems, so I decided that I would help take on this huge global problem, like my 2 cousins had, but in a much bigger way.
(Sophia and Rody) 




With the help of your donations we are going to buy biodegradable toothbrushes for the very first time, through our very new, and very unique, organization. 
Operation Brush wants to change the lives of children around the world, and we need your help to help them! 
By making a donation you are helping to improve the lives of children. In addition to giving these children in need the ability to eat without pain, preventing the loss of teeth, and decreasing their chances of developing chronic illnesses caused by poor oral hygiene, we are improving their overall health and happiness with the help of your donation! 



            
It is easy to relate to a lot of charities you see out there in the world today, for example: almost everyone has, or knows someone that has battled some form of cancer. However in our case we have always owned a toothbrush, and everyone we have ever known has owned a toothbrush; so at first, this cause seems hard to understand. But when you really think about it, it's the easiest thing to understand, we've been brushing all our lives, multiple times a day! The reality unfortunately, is that most of the world doesn't see the devastating effects that poor oral hygiene has on individuals. 


This cause impacts the lives of children whose families unfortunately can't provide this basic need to them. 

Did You Know? 
Poor Oral Hygiene Is Directly Related To:




Heart disease (#1 cause of death worldwide)StrokeMiscarriage and premature birthDiabetes
Memory loss (e.g. Alzheimer's disease)Pneumonia and other lung diseasesCancers of the: tongue, pancreas, kidney, blood, and lungs


With your help, and together we can reduce these chronic illnesses that occur in children's lives.




We are looking to raise $3,500

The money will be used to buy (at a special discounted price) biodegradable toothbrushes. It will also help pay for the shipping expenses, get our accounting system in place to manage our finances, and pay for the application fee for the IRS tax exempt 501(c)(3) form.
Here is a break down of how the funds are distributed.



                                                            

As our way of thanking you, you will receive awesome perks for your donations! (Perks are listed on the top right.)
*All donation are tax-deductible* 





NEW PERK BELOW!!!  *Comes with all perks from $10 on*
















NOTE: If you select one of the perks with a biodegradable toothbrush, we will be in contact with you to find out what size toothbrush you want. We have different sizes of toothbrushes for different size people. 




                                

We get asked a lot, ""Why biodegradable instead of plastic?"" That is a great question.

Here's a 24hr time lapse of bamboo growing, it truly is amazing how fast it can grow!

</h3>Gail and I have been in the customer service industry for...well lets just say...more years than I want to count! We have known each other for over 15 years and very excited to open our new venture. <br/><br/>We are opening a Olive Oil and Vinegar tasting center with over 50 different Olive Oils and Balsamic Vinegars  to choose from. If you are unable to stop in our shop don't worry we will be selling all of our products on-line. <br/><br/>We didn't take this venture lightly. We have tested a lot of different types of oils and vinegars from different suppliers.  We believe we found the best. Not only is it fresh and healthy, but the taste is amazing! We want to share this experience with you! To prove we have the freshest product in the market, we will include the crush date on all of our olive oils. <br/><br/><b><h3>Does the Color of the Olive Make a Difference? <br/>
</h3></b>Olives are essentially the same fruit, picked at different stages of ripening, with different colors at different stages of ripening. All olives start off green and as they grow and ripen, they will start to turn yellowish.  Next, they will turn red and then a deep purple, with an end stage of black and soft. The majority of olive oils are a blend of both green and black olives. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>This may not seem like much to most, but we are excited to know that only the freshest Olive Oil comes from Green Olives. <br/><br/>Green Olives tend to be firmer than the black juicer olives. Because of the green olives firmness, it simply takes more to produce a liter of oil than it does with black ones. Our product is produced from olives grown on large estates where the average time between picking and crushing is six hours. What does that mean for you? You get a product that is high in polyphenols (High Antioxidants) and very low FFA’s (Free Fatty Acids) and peroxide levels.<p></p><p></p><h3>Olive Oil is Highly Perishable </h3>No olive oil has a shelf life  more than 12 - 14 months. Packages that claim a “shelf life” of more than 12-14 months do not warn the consumer that the oil has deteriorated over time and is a shadow of its original shelf in terms of flavor and nutritional value.<p></p><p>As olive oil ages, it becomes softer and softer in flavor while the peroxide value rises (Peroxide value measures rancidity). Rancid Oil is a health hazard and many olive oils are rancid before they are ever purchased or consumed.</p><p>So, take our challenge! Grab your favorite oil and see if it provides the crush date?  No?  Then ask the manufacturer if they can or will provide that information to you.  Ask if they know long it has been sitting on their shelf?

<h3>Wait, quidditch?</h3>

As previously mentioned, CofC Quidditch is not officially recognized by our university as a club sport or sport. This means that what little funding we have received from the College for this year has already been spent - on new t-shirts and travel to the South Regionals Tournament last weekend.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unlike college teams to the north and south of us - we're looking at you baddasses, Middlebury, Boston, Miami, Ringling - quidditch is not taken quite so seriously here in Charleston. We have fundraised tirelessly. We have spent hours upon hours handcrafting snitch-shaped Christmas ornaments. We have sacrificed official jerseys for marketable t-shirts. While some teams run around in school-funded uniforms, we make do with home-made brooms and mostly-deflated balls.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While we have been to World Cups in the past, they have been entirely self-funded. This year, CofC Quidditch is composed almost entirely both of freshman who are just beginning to adjust to their college lives and seniors on the team who must think ahead to beyond graduation when making their plans for World Cup VI. This means that self-funding the trip to the World Cup is probably not going to be possible. As much as it kills us to, we need to ask you for help.</div>

<h3>Okay, so what exactly do you need?</h3>
<p>To be quite honest, we need anything we can get, but we're aiming for about $600. There are 21 of us on the travel team. We don't need plane tickets; we all plan to drive down to Kissimmee since we're already in the South. Any funds you donate to our cause will go toward hotel rates in Florida and gas to get our cars there and back.</p>
<p>We understand if you cannot spare even a dollar to help us on our way to Florida in April - please, though, do not hesitate to share this page with everyone you know. TELL EVERYONE - your Facebooks, your Tumblrs, your Twittererers, your Instagramlies, I dunno.</p>

For those of you that don't know, this is a 10 day horse race in August 2012 across outer Mongolia. We'll be riding the semi-wild horses of the Mongolian nomads on the same route the Huns ""pony express"" followed.</p>
<p><strong>Here's an excerpt taken off the race's website:</strong></p>
<p>""The Mongol Derby is the longest, toughest horse race in the world. It's the Khaan's mother of equine adventures, a 1000 km multi-horse race across the epic wilderness of the Mongolian steppe. Its mammoth network of horse stations is a recreation of Chinggis Khaan's legendary empire-busting postal system.""</p>
<p>We'll be riding for 12 hours or more a day depending on what we can handle. Navigating across Mongolia through rain, swollen rivers and mountains...we will be switching out horses two to three times a day at urttus along the way. We will be camping at night with either just our horse of the moment or with the Mongolian nomads and eating whatever they are cooking for dinner. I'm thinking I should get Pepto Bismol to be a sponsor...</p>
<p>There will be a live tracker so my family/friends/sponsors can be a part of the adventure. Looks like there will also be satellite stations at some points along the race for riders to upload video/photos. I cant wait to share my experiences hanging with the nomads and wild horses with everyone.</p>
<p>Here's the race's official website if you'd like to read more on it.<br/><a href=""http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-derby"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/m...</a></p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong><br/>For those of you that are asking ""why"" well basically I asked myself the same thing, why would I want to compete in this insane race? The answer came in the form of a question, What am I really doing that's challenging myself at the current moment? ""The same ol same ol"" becomes the everyday and without even realizing it you get stuck into a routine where it becomes auto pilot.  I feel that once you become comfortable in life, you stop growing as an individual -- e.g., learning new skills, having the ability to adapt to a new environment, you lose the excitement for adventure and life in general. I want to put myself in an uncomfortable position and in turn, challenge the skills that I have already acquired. Maybe more importantly for me, I will have to face one of the biggest challenges yet, being a world away from home, with a prominent language barrier, living with/relying on a nomadic people and instead of relying on my car to get me from place to place, I will be relying solely on the horses of the steppes to carry me 650 miles to my destination....the finish line!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>They only pick about 35 riders to compete from hundreds of applicants from around the world. Of this 35, only a few are American. This is some crazy adventure but it's also a race for charity.</p>
<p>The current official charity of the race is Mercy Corps Mongolia, who run economic development projects in rural Mongolia, helping herders access markets, business expertise and each other, to secure a sustainable and meaningful livelihood.</p>
<p>You can check out this special video showing how the funds raised for the Mercy Corps are used in Mongolia. <a href=""http://youtu.be/NH83iiWclco"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/NH83iiWclco</a></p>
<p>Each rider picks a charity they are racing for as well. I will be racing for The Children's Scholarship Fund. The Children's Scholarship Fund aims to maximize educational opportunity for all children: for those in need by offering tuition assistance in grades K-8 for alternatives to faltering conventional schools, and for all children by supporting and cultivating education reform and parental choice efforts across the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Horse Sense</strong><br/>I grew up riding on a horse farm in Missouri, so I learned at a young age how to connect with the horse. Learning how to ride a horse bareback and at high speeds heightened my awareness of equine movement and behavior as there were no saddle/stirrups to aid in keeping balance nor saddle horn to hang onto when things got rough. This dance of the horse and rider will be an integral part of my survival in the race. As a rider I also have to be submissive to a horses instincts, especially the ones that tell him to avoid the marmot holes (there are a lot of those in Mongolia) that could break his leg!</p>
<p>Through some research and help from friends, I was able to track down and connect with 2 previous Americans who competed in the Mongol Derby before.  Kat Swigart of California and Sophia Mangalee of New Jersey.  Conventiently enough I was living in Los Angeles at the time I got in contact with Kat (I lived about 2 hours away from her) and ended up getting the opportunity to train with her on her awesome Thouroughbred and Arabian endurance race horses.  I got a ton of advice from her in regards to the race and what to bring/expect.  Then I moved back to NYC and got in contact with Sophia and got her perspective, she was nice enough to come with me and advise me on what gear I would need/would not need from her own experience.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What I Need</strong><br/>The entry fee for the race is super expensive, like $10,000 expensive!! The plane ticket to get me to Mongolia is $2,500. I've already raised/paid $7,500 of the entry fee.  Right now I still need $2,500 for the plane ticket, $2,500 for my last installment in the entry and $2,000 still to go towards my chosen charities.</p>
<p>Im seeking corporate/private sponsors as well to both sponsor me monetarily as well as provide me with the special gear Ill need for the race, such as riding boots, compass, thermal weather proof riding apparel, lite-weight sleeping gear, small durable cameras, camelbak M.U.L.E ect.</p>
<p>I will be featuring my sponsors both on my Rider Profile Page, my Derby Facebook page and in press materials. For those that send me adhesives I will wear their logos throughout the race as well.</p>

<p>After 5 years of fertility treatments, my wife and I decided to stop all treatments and leave it in God's hands. To our SURPRISE, 5 months later we found out we were pregnant, after being told for 5 years that we would NEVER concieve on our own.</p>
<p>Our son, Isaac, has always been on the GO! He started fully independant walking by 9 months, and by 11 months he was running everywhere.  We always joked that it was a miracle that he hadn't broke a bone or needed stitches yet.</p>
<p>Last year, 2012, we flew through the year with out using our insurance deductible, so we decided we would drop our insurance down for 2013 and save money. Two weeks into 2013, we took our at the time 22 month old back to the dentist for his 6month check up, where we found out that he had the start of ""bottle rot"" (He has never had a bottle). We had to have a flouride treatment done, and we were told that we would need to come back in 3 months for another. If it progressed, he'd need to have surgery to clean the decay out and possibly pull/replace some of the teeth.  We were DEVASTATED. Just 6 months before, we were advised by the dentist that the little brown spots on his teeth were mineral staining from his vitamin drops.</p>
<p>In February, we took Isaac for his 2 year well child check up, where his doctor was concerned about the lack of sleep he gets because he's up all night with tummy pain. So she sent him for blood work to check for Chron's, Celiac.....which was $427.00.</p>
<p>March 23rd, Isaac was running through the house in socks, when he slipped and fell into the splits. He couldn't put any weight on the leg when he got up so we went to the ER. Turns out, he got a spiral fracture in the femur on the left leg which required surgery and he's now in a Spica cast (a cast around his rib cage, that goes down to the ankle of the broken leg and down to the knee of his other leg).</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ABoj3Kw2J90/UWILWoMY14I/AAAAAAAAAj8/L5niynEG6NQ/s640/73762_3831663050199_850512207_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our portion so far for the ER visit, Xrays, Er doctors, and surgery is just a bit over $3,000.  We haven't seen the bill yet for the Ortho at the Er, the orthopedic doctor who did the surgery, Anesthesia, etc. Apri 17th, we go back to the dentist for another flouride treatment and for a surgery consult. We're told there will be 4 more ortho office visits, at least 2 more sets of xrays, and the cast removal.</p>
<p> So we're asking for some help as we don't have the ability to pay for the bills and we don't want to not pay the doctors when they're working on our little boy.</p>

<p>I would like to introduce you to Hillary Plummer! She is the most amazing person I've ever known, her charismatic smile and positive energy is unrivaled, nothing has ever brought her down even in the toughest of times. She is an amazing character that brings life and excitement everywhere she goes. She loves dogs and perfumes and is always trying to get people to try something new. She is a one of a kind character with a big heart and a genuine concern for others. </p>
<p><strong>The Accident -</strong></p>
<p>On Sunday December 9 Hillary was having problems with her insulin pump and she was vomiting all foods and liquids. On Monday December 10, she missed work and thank god her work called her mother to check in. She had passed out on her kitchen floor and her blood sugar was dangerously high. Had her mother not checked in with her we would be without Hillary today. Because her blood sugar was over 1800, she experienced Diabetic Ketoacidosis.</p>

<h1><em><strong>WE INTRODUCE TO YOU SPECULOO WONDER SPREAD, INFUSED WITH THAT FAMOUS DELICIOUS COOKIE FROM EUROPE TO CREATE A SWEET, SAVORY, INTENSE AND MOUTH WATERING FLAVOR WITHOUT BEING TOO SWEET!</strong></em></h1>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WONDER SPREAD is locally made with love and purpose. Each jar is infused with Speculoo cookies and mixed with a blend of savory and flavorful ingredients. The spread will melt in your mouth with goodness. #WonderSpread #Delicious #Yummy #MustEat<br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>WHO WE ARE AND ABOUT WONDER SPREAD<br/></strong></h2>
<p>     The name of Wonder Spread originated from our oldest daughter named Zoey, who is 7yrs old. We were having a taste testing in our kitchen and she was one of our first tasters. And believe me, she was NOT a willing participant. My wife still laughs when I tell this story. I asked Zoey into the kitchen and told her that mommy and daddy had made a new peanut butter like spread. Immediately, she had the look of horror on her face and her eyes was looking for the nearest exit. I firmly asked her to sit down and asked her to taste our new recipe.</p>
<p>     She sat down reluctantly and I said, ""Ok Zoey. Tell me what you think."" She replied, ""Nah, I'm good."" I tried to be sneaky and spoon feed her a small amount but she was just fast enough to have her right cheek smeared with the spread. Slowly getting frustrated and anxious to hear her opinion, I decided, the best option was bribery. I told her, ""Zoey, if you try alittle bit, I will buy you something from Target."" Suddenly, Zoey turned to me and with a soft voice replied, ""Yes, papa"". I continued, ""If you try this for papa, I will buy you something really nice at Target."" Zoey jumped up and out of her chair and said excited, ""REALLY! A SCOOTER!"". Then I replied reluctantly and mumbled under my breath, ""Yes. A scooter"". She reached for the spoon and tasted the spread.</p>
<p>     Suddenly, a smirk formed on her face which turned into a big smile and she said, ""This is WONDERFUL! OMG! I WONDER what you guys made this stuff out of."" Then she surprisingly reached over to the table and took another big spoonful and devoured it whole. She turned to us and said ""Good job Papa. Good job Momma. It's so yummy. Could you pack my lunch for tommorrow with that stuff. By the way, are we going to Target now?""</p>
<p>     When we returned from Target, Zoey said, ""Papa, that yummy stuff that I tried earlier, why don't you call it WONDER SPREAD. Cuz when you try it and it tastes so yummy, you WONDER what it is made of. Since that moment, Zoey has been active in all aspects of Wonder Spread. She always asks me, ""Hey Papa, how's my business doing?"" You can't imagine how much pride a father can have until you have experienced that moment when two loves collide: the love of your daughter and the love for business.</p>
<p>    We believe without a doubt that Wonder Spread is the most delicious, savory and most mouth watering spread that you ever tasted because of it's sweet, savory, slightly carmelized flavor perfectly balanced so that it is not to sweet.</p>

<h1><em>WE NEED YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT</em></h1>
<p>Thank you for being here! Mad love from Team Wonder Spread (Raxajack Urquico, Anabeth Urquico &amp; Zoey) -- we are truly excited to launch Wonder Spread on Indiegogo. </p>
<p>We've been working hard to make this happen for the last year and <strong>now need to raise a minimum of $10,000</strong> to complete our next batch of Wonder Spread, payment of required licenses (USDA)/permits and the most expensive cost which is the vacuum sealing machine using induction cap sealing technology.* If we are able to beat our minimum goal, we can make more Wonder Spread and really grow this movement together. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for being a part of this with us!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*<strong>FOR ALL YOU TECHIES: INDUCTION CAP SEALING TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>Most of all the major food manufacturers use this technology to place their Sealer on their products. The sealer is highly suitable for keeping your product hermetically sealed, tamper evident, maintian freshness, free from oxidation and contamination, sealed for consumer confidence, leak and evaporation resistant.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>WARNING: Once you have tasted Wonder Spread, you may not be able to stop eating it. Spread it on everything. You're gonna LOVE it!</h1>
<h1><strong>REASONS TO EAT WONDER SPREAD</strong></h1>

WONDER SPREAD is locally made with love and purpose. Each jar is infused with Speculoo cookies and mixed with a blend of savory and flavorful ingredients. The spread will melt in your mouth with goodness. #WonderSpread #Delicious #Yummy #MustEat
 
WHO WE ARE AND ABOUT WONDER SPREAD
     The name of Wonder Spread originated from our oldest daughter named Zoey, who is 7yrs old. We were having a taste testing in our kitchen and she was one of our first tasters. And believe me, she was NOT a willing participant. My wife still laughs when I tell this story. I asked Zoey into the kitchen and told her that mommy and daddy had made a new peanut butter like spread. Immediately, she had the look of horror on her face and her eyes was looking for the nearest exit. I firmly asked her to sit down and asked her to taste our new recipe.
     She sat down reluctantly and I said, ""Ok Zoey. Tell me what you think."" She replied, ""Nah, I'm good."" I tried to be sneaky and spoon feed her a small amount but she was just fast enough to have her right cheek smeared with the spread. Slowly getting frustrated and anxious to hear her opinion, I decided, the best option was bribery. I told her, ""Zoey, if you try alittle bit, I will buy you something from Target."" Suddenly, Zoey turned to me and with a soft voice replied, ""Yes, papa"". I continued, ""If you try this for papa, I will buy you something really nice at Target."" Zoey jumped up and out of her chair and said excited, ""REALLY! A SCOOTER!"". Then I replied reluctantly and mumbled under my breath, ""Yes. A scooter"". She reached for the spoon and tasted the spread.
     Suddenly, a smirk formed on her face which turned into a big smile and she said, ""This is WONDERFUL! OMG! I WONDER what you guys made this stuff out of."" Then she surprisingly reached over to the table and took another big spoonful and devoured it whole. She turned to us and said ""Good job Papa. Good job Momma. It's so yummy. Could you pack my lunch for tommorrow with that stuff. By the way, are we going to Target now?""
     When we returned from Target, Zoey said, ""Papa, that yummy stuff that I tried earlier, why don't you call it WONDER SPREAD. Cuz when you try it and it tastes so yummy, you WONDER what it is made of. Since that moment, Zoey has been active in all aspects of Wonder Spread. She always asks me, ""Hey Papa, how's my business doing?"" You can't imagine how much pride a father can have until you have experienced that moment when two loves collide: the love of your daughter and the love for business.
    We believe without a doubt that Wonder Spread is the most delicious, savory and most mouth watering spread that you ever tasted because of it's sweet, savory, slightly carmelized flavor perfectly balanced so that it is not to sweet.

WE NEED YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT
Thank you for being here! Mad love from Team Wonder Spread (Raxajack Urquico, Anabeth Urquico & Zoey) -- we are truly excited to launch Wonder Spread on Indiegogo. 
We've been working hard to make this happen for the last year and now need to raise a minimum of $10,000 to complete our next batch of Wonder Spread, payment of required licenses (USDA)/permits and the most expensive cost which is the vacuum sealing machine using induction cap sealing technology.* If we are able to beat our minimum goal, we can make more Wonder Spread and really grow this movement together. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for being a part of this with us!
 
*FOR ALL YOU TECHIES: INDUCTION CAP SEALING TECHNOLOGY
Most of all the major food manufacturers use this technology to place their Sealer on their products. The sealer is highly suitable for keeping your product hermetically sealed, tamper evident, maintian freshness, free from oxidation and contamination, sealed for consumer confidence, leak and evaporation resistant.

<p>Over the last year, we have delivered and committed tens of thousands of nutrition packs and bars to children in need, both domestically and abroad. The way that we see it, this is still not enough.</p>
<p>It is our goal to <strong>distribute 200,000 nutrition packs in 2013.</strong></p>
<p>While childhood malnutrition is a chronic problem in the developing world, children in our own communities are suffering from obesity and poor dietary choice. There are very few healthy snacks that are delicious and exciting for children. For this reason, we conceived of a product line that allows parents to buy a healthy product for their children, and in doing so, provide a life-saving nutrition pack to a child across the world. This means expanding our product line to include a fun, exciting format that suits the palette and caloric needs of children. Funding this expansion is no small feat, though, and that's where your support comes in! Now that you see the big picture, we hope you will help us spread health to children near and far.</p>

With the funding from Indiegogo, we are aiming to launch three delicious flavors!


At KUTOA™, our delicious, all-natural bars are only half of the equation. We are working to benefit World Food Program USA and support World Food Program’s manufacturing and delivery of nutrition packets to children in need. The World Food Program currently operates in 75 countries and works on the front lines, providing emergency food aid in times of crisis as well as providing long-term sustainable solutions to hunger. In 2011, they reached more than 90 million people with food assistance in more than 70 countries. For every KUTOA™ bar that is sold, we donate and deliver a nutrition pack to a child in need. The nutrition packs are filled with the vitamins, minerals and micro-nutrients essential for maintaining bodily functions, growth, immunity, productivity, and prevention of mortality among vulnerable populations. They are delivered to severely malnourished children between the ages of 6 and 59 months and effectively alleviate malnutrition and the long list of awful diseases that coincide.
Did you know...

When you purchase a KUTOA™ Health Bar, you are not only making a health-conscious decision in your own life, you are also giving health to a child in need. The health you give this child will empower them to live a healthy life, go to school, and become a contributing member of their community.
 

 
 
Not only do our givers get our eternal gratitude, but they also have the chance to try the new product line that they helped fund and snag some specially made KUTOA™ apparel! 
 

Over the last year, we have delivered and committed tens of thousands of nutrition packs and bars to children in need, both domestically and abroad. The way that we see it, this is still not enough.
It is our goal to distribute 200,000 nutrition packs in 2013.
While childhood malnutrition is a chronic problem in the developing world, children in our own communities are suffering from obesity and poor dietary choice. There are very few healthy snacks that are delicious and exciting for children. For this reason, we conceived of a product line that allows parents to buy a healthy product for their children, and in doing so, provide a life-saving nutrition pack to a child across the world. This means expanding our product line to include a fun, exciting format that suits the palette and caloric needs of children. Funding this expansion is no small feat, though, and that's where your support comes in! Now that you see the big picture, we hope you will help us spread health to children near and far.
Thank you,

<p>‘Nootropics’ is a term coined by Romanian doctor Corneliu Giurgea in the 1970’s when he created what he believed to be the first nootropic - something he defined as a cognitive enhancer that was non-toxic and non-addictive. These two qualities distinguish nootropics from other previously thought cognitive enhancers such as amphetamines, which are commonly abused by students throughout the world despite adverse long-term effects in terms of neurotransmitter depletion and reduced connectivity in the brain.</p>
<p>Rather than providing a rapid and very temporary release of neurotransmitters involved in cognitive processing, nootropics have many other alternative methods of action such as: endogenously allowing the brain to produce more of these neurotransmitters, increasing blood flow within the brain, altering the way in which neurons use energy for increa<span>sed efficiency, and sometimes even signaling the brain to produce more neurons or connections between neurons. While the nootropic market is an exciting and emerging field where much research still has to be done, all of the ingredients in our blends are sufficiently studied to show cognitive improvement with no neurophysiological harm involved.</span></p>The effects include enhanced focus, memory, and mental agility from the most basic to most demanding tasks.<p></p>

We use a method that what seems every gym in our area lacks: Boxing. 

We first implemented boxing into our clients' workout plans as a means to do cardiovascular training and increase hand speed for our baseball and basketball clients. It became very popular so we began to do it for anyone seeking personal training for weight loss and strength training.

We believe that our non-intimidating and fun boxing studio will aid the local community of Rochester and surrounding area in health, just as it did our athletes. We want to help you have the energy to run around with your kids, fit into that dress or suit you want to wear, lower your blood pressure, and help you feel strong and confident about yourself.


  
Our Goal, Your Gain...

<p><br/></p>
<p>Hi, My name is Meghan Riley. And I recently scored ZERO on a
3D vision test. 3d movies? They don’t work for me! Does that mean I see in 2D?
hmmm, It means that I have a dominant eye. Both eyes take in peripheral information
at the side, but right in front of my nose where depth perception is concerned,
my brain only receives information from my left, dominant eye. If I cover this
eye, my right eye DOES work… but it’s very farsighted in comparison to my left.
3D vision combines what each eye sees into one image but for this my two eyes just
don’t work together.</p>
<p>I’ve known about the way I see and have wanted 3D vision for
many years, but I’ve never had any success in the past. </p>
<p>Anyways this year, after experiencing more and more headaches
around my weak eye, I decided to seek out Vision Therapy.</p>
<p>I made an appointment with Doctor Bastien in Montreal and put my vision to the test. While testing my eyes, he asked about
exercise and whether I play any team sports. When I told him “Oh no! I’ve never
been very good at that” He laughed and said “of course you’re not!!” Turns out,
there are a lot of things that I avoid because of my lack of depth perception
and I could rant for a while about the subtle ways my life would change and
improve if I gained 3D vision. But I’ll keep this short. </p>
<p>It’s happening. I’m gonna do it!</p>
<p> I’ve just started my
vision therapy sessions, I have one contact lens for my weak eye, and some nifty
vision therapy Jedi training tools. I’ll be practicing 4 days a week and visiting
the optometrist  once a month. The training program will last a year. </p>
<p><b>There’s no
time like the present. I’m ready for this vision upgrade! 3D vision, Here I
come!!!</b></p>
<p>Yes, But all this is an unexpected financial expense. I’d like to raise the funds for the complete vision therapy program over the
next two  and a half months. And I’d like to
do that using my skill sets.</p>
<p><b>I am a vocalist, fibres artist and painter. And I’m also a
massage therapist in training. I practice Swedish and Thai Yoga Massage. </b></p>
<p><b>For April, May and June, I want to work full-time in my
field. So if you would like to support my vision therapy quest, employ me as the artist I am!</b> You can order a
quilt! I’ll sew a gorgeous quilt for you! Or a personalized portrait doll! Imagine
this! You send me a photo of you as a child, I’ll paint your portrait, and make
a cuddly doll that represents your inner child! What? That’s beautiful.</p>
<p>You can buy a digital download of my compilation album that
features work I’ve done with a number of talented artists over the years, or sign up for weekly lullabies.  I’ll send you a ten-minute track
of improvised lullaby song each week. </p>
<p>If you’re local to Montreal, join my weekly Experimental
Choir! Or book me for a massage: Swedish or Thai Yoga. I also offer a Vocal
lesson/Massage combo that will get you sinking into sublime song. For real!</p>
<p>So with that, I say Thank you! Get in touch! Wish me luck.
And feel free to share my campaign widely! </p>

<p>My name is C. E. Flores. I have been vegan for 9+ years, a Certified Personal Trainer (PTS) during the last 8 years, and Certified Nutrition and Wellness Specialist (NWS and soon to be certified in Nutrition and Weight Loss, NWL) and Certified Kettebells Specialist (KBTS) both during the last 5-6 years. I come from a Wholefoods Plant-Based approach at dealing with nutrition. I also come from a Bodyweight/Functional paradigm when it comes to training. Both of these are optimal; the former is an optimal way to eat and the latter is an optimal way to train. The result of bringing both of these together is your Optimal Health. VeganTrainer Studio will be located near the downtown core of the city in a 750 - 1,000+ sq ft accessible studio, accessible via private and public transit with plenty of street and paid parking.</p><p>The campaign to raise $20,000 for the VeganTrainer Studio allows for the creation of our petite boutique (multipurpose) studio/training space, the equipping of our kitchen studio and training studio and the offering of our in studio, on site and online remote access classes/workshops. The nutrition and/or training studio spaces will allow for training to be either personal (1 on 1), partner (2 on 1), or small groups (of 3 up to 5 on 1) and possibly up to 10 on 1, depending on how much support we get. The creation of VeganTrainer Studio is of import not just to me as this is part of my contribution to the planet, but to the health and wellness of Torontonians, the  Earth's future, and the animals whose lives it impacts the most - since each person that goes vegan 'saves' thousands of other animals lives in their lifetime - the impact is exponential. VeganTrainer Studio serves as a role model of sustainable, compassionate and holistic living that can be modeled, and scaled.<br/><br/>VeganTrainer Studio will also rent out the training studio when it is not in use since it is a multipurpose facility that seeks to help foster not just the sense of community, but provide many with a 100% vegan space that is affordable, naturally lit, and pre-wired for multimedia. Whether the users are yoga instructors, Registered Massage Therapists, or Vegan business minded people/entrepreneurs - the studio will be fore hire and remain vegan. VeganTrainer Studio hopes to serve the Vegan community in Toronto and beyond as a venue for meetings, events such as workshops, and other educational events on site, and online. VeganTrainer Studio will be equipped with a large projection screen, projector, vintage audiophile equipment, whiteboards, and other high tech gadgets and software making organizing/communication and electronic billing easier. VeganTrainer Studio in an inclusive, Anti-Oppressive, LGTBQ* and Womyn Positive safe space and Anti-Speciesist space focused on developing and fostering positive space for all our clients, their extended families and all other human and non-human animals in their lives. <br/><br/>While most gyms facilities are too large, too impersonal and too focused on 
areas that do not optimize their clients health and wellness results VeganTrainer Studio is the direct opposite. VeganTrainer Studio prides itself on optimizing results for our clientele through a holistic lifestyle approach. Often gym facilities will also charge twice; once for 'membership' and the second time for personal 
training. VeganTrainer Studio seeks to make the entire experience 
different by providing personal to small group, in an intimate environment 
bringing integrated nutrition and training together in a single 
community focused place - at a single price. No need to buy 50 sessions in 
order to receive discount pricing either. VeganTrainer Studio will be that 
place where your name is known, where you are always glad that you went,
 and know that you will be seen with the greatest of attention.<br/><br/>Contributors will help the secure the 750 - 1,000+ sq. ft studio space in our prime downtown/centrally adjacent location. Contributors will also help to equip the studios (kitchen and training) with kitchen pots and pans, Vitamix/Blendtec blender, and other kitchen equipment including juicers. The training studio will be equipped with bodyweight and functional implements including TRXs, Kettlebells, VIPRs, and other sports and fitness equipment. Contributors will help VeganTrainer Studio to get fully set up and operational within the next 100 day period. As well, any extra contributions will assist in the development and operations of the office such as with purchases of other assessment equipment, updated hardware/software or with upgrading the space with office equipment.  VeganTrainer Studio will also be offering CPR/SFA and AED courses out of the studio in 2015 apart from its core work around health and wellness lifestyle programming.<br/></p><p>We offer:</p><p></p><div><ul>

Much &lt;3 and thanks again!<br/></p><p>If VeganTrainer Studio does not manage to get the proposed $20,000 in funding, the money raised will be allocated toward either the studio and upgrading it ($6,000 - $8,000) and/or toward the purchasing training equipment ($8,750). And lastly the kitchen equipment ($2,400). We will also do social events in the Community (vegan and non-vegan) to help raise awareness and funds for our project. We look forward for meeting the aim that we have set in mind. Ideally VeganTrainer Studio would love to raise $20,000+ with the support of the community. This journey will not be made alone since another world is not only possible, it is a must - and we must all work together to make it happen.</p><p>If we exceed the funding goal we will put the monies toward developing programs, developing out of studio services and the purchase of more high quality leading edge gym and kitchen equipment to service the community better. We are also open to the idea of upgrading the space for something larger if we have the funds or finding something more central. Beneath is a breakdown of additional funding if we can exceed the goals and their particular designated purchases. Please, refer to the original breakdown a couple of paragraphs above.

The following lifestyle diseases are claiming an unnecessary, and nearly preventable toll on Canadian's health (in no particular order) obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and kidney disease.  These diseases are often connected to acidic diets, that lack nutrients and that overly focused on animal products with excessive animal protein and animal fat and processed foods and sugars. <br/></p><p>Healthy eating may be best achieved with a plant-based diet, which 
we define as a regimen that encourages whole, plant-based foods and 
discourages meats, dairy products, and eggs as well as all refined and processed foods. - Kaiser Permanente Journal, 2013. <br/></p><p>This journal article goes on to say that research shows ""that plant-based diets are cost-effective, low-risk 
interventions that may lower body mass index, blood pressure, HbA1C, and
 cholesterol levels. They may also reduce the number of medications 
needed to treat chronic diseases and lower ischemic heart disease mortality rates. <strong>Physicians should consider recommending a plant-based diet to ALL their patients</strong>, especially those patients with high blood pressure, diabetes<u>, </u>cardiovascular disease, or obesity."" The journal article notes that ""perhaps out of all the diets out there that have been used to treat chronic illnesses, <strong>the best but perhaps least common may be those that are plant based</strong>… Despite
 the strong body of evidence favoring plant-based diets, including 
studies showing a willingness of the general public to embrace them, 
many physicians are not stressing the importance of plant-based diets as
 a first-line treatment for chronic illnesses. <strong>This could be because of a lack of awareness of these diets or a lack of patient education resources."" </strong>This is where VeganTrainer Studio steps in to partner up as an educator, facilitator, and centre for empowerment from a holistic approach to help Canadians regain their health in conjunction with their health care provider(s).<br/></p><p>In the US, the Department of Agriculture responsible for dietary guidelines notes that, ""...If 
the Committee actually discussed this research, it would be unable to 
justify its recommendation to eat meat, as the research would show that 
meat increases the risks of chronic diseases, contrary to the purposes 
of the Guidelines. Thus, by simply ignoring that research, the Committee
 is able to reach a conclusion that would otherwise look improper."" In Canada, most of the work is centred around the Canadian Food Guide that is a bit more proactive than the US version, although it is really close in its acceptance of the consumption of meat, dairy and eggs.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the conflict of interest exists between the organization(s) that is/are supposed to promote health and the ones that promote food industries. The latter are often that are often lobbied by the marketing boards that represent each industry - and push their product into the food policy of the government, as well as, often receive large subsidies from government making their food more readily available at a lower cost than market value. This forces the pushing of its level consumption at the detriment of the health of the general population. You can even see this now with the new studies that conclude that eating eggs is like smoking, and that milk does not do the body good. This is great marketing, but bad science!</p><p></p><p>VeganTrainer Studio as noted will provide personal to group nutritional training, counseling and education workshops around food preparation, juicing and cooking. VeganTrainer Studio will also offer other services around food including Shopping Tours, Meal Planning* and Shopping Services.  Dietary help is key to helping us avoid become the statistical norm that large numbers of Canadians are used to hearing about. VeganTrainer Studio's motto of Optimal Nutrition represents a desire to break away from the chance of becoming a lifestyle based statistic into becoming an empowered actor in ones own life. The choice to live life healthfully is in one's hands and it begins with what one eats.<br/></p><p>VeganTrainer Studio seeks to provide the best in Personal, Partner, and Small Group Training including Bootcamps in Toronto. With our focus on functional/body weight workouts we seek to optimize your every day performance where it counts -- in your everyday life. Whether you are a beginner, intermediate or a weekend warrior, there is a space for you at VeganTrainer Studio to help you push yourself beyond what you are used to not only to perform better by carrying your own weight, but to be at your best through our focus on Optimal Training. Through the use of other functional movement/dynamic based implements such as TRX suspension trainers, Kettlebells, and VIPR or BOSU we hope to push you further once you have achieved mastery over your own weight. Training will be provided in either 1) Personal basis and 2) Supervised basis. The former is what we have come to know as 'Personal Training' and the latter is more like bootcamp instruction or an alternative for those who already have a program from another Certified and Insured Personal Trainer but need assistance and support without being as meticulous as Personal Training.<br/></p><p>VeganTrainer Studio realizes that the every journey begins with a single step. Just as a business begins with a single idea. Many hours have gone into this project and many more will go into it into the future. Your support is greatly appreciated at making this multipurpose space a reality. VeganTrainer Studio will be delivering high quality services and products to assist you not just to regain your health, but to optimize it. At VeganTrainer Studio we want you to partake with us on this journey. Together we can bring a better lifestyle outlook forth for many Torontonians at affordable rates thanks to the magic of group training.</p><p>VeganTrainer Studio is our pilot project on Indiegogo. We are proud to be part of this amazing community of individuals that support through their own version of micro-lending to fund ideas that are worthwhile. We have committed ourselves to work 12 hours a day since we believe that we cannot do it without you, as much as we believe that you probably will not do it with us. VeganTrainer Studio has taken the leadership to stand out from the rest and is here to support the downtown core becoming healthier and more active because we do not want to be part of the lifestyle statistics. We truly believe that people do not want to be unhealthy or inactive, but that people need to find something that suits their character, their outlook on life, schedule and their ethics. We are here for you. We recognize that our bodies have the ability to heal - given the proper nutrition, and proper movement.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>How Else Can You Can Help?</h3><p>We recognize that some of you may not be able at this time to contribute financially although you agree wholeheartedly with VeganTrainer Studio's purpose and mission. We have not forgotten that your contribution is as important if not more important than money. We remind you that without you we cannot build a better world and that it not only takes money to make things happen, but awesome inspiring and amazing people like you. So, you are wondering how you as a single person can help? Well, pay it forward. Send this to at least 3 other people and ask them to do the same and to keep it going for as long as they can. </p><p>We request that you take the time of day when you can during the next 40 days to tell your friends, family and loved ones about VeganTrainer Studio. Even tell those people that are not your friends, like co-workers you may not be too close with, who may benefit, bosses whose companies could use corporate wellness programs, or just a stranger on the street with whom you strike a conversation whether it be around eating clean eating or needing more physical activity in your life. We at VeganTrainer Studio need to make lots of buzzzzzzzz since this is the first space like this of its kind in Toronto, and probably Canada. </p><p>VeganTrainer Studio was inspired by the work of numerous other vegans out there. Many of them are doctors, activists, and other professionals and their work is relentless primarily for the animals, but secondarily for the planet and lastly for our own existence as a species including our health. We at VeganTrainer Studio ask you to get out there and get the word out and spread the word as noted earlier. Feel free to use your social media, your telephones, emails, slow mail, or any of the Indiegogo share tools! Once again, we thank you! We look forward to offering you our services in the near future and helping you become a person that thrives to help us make this a better world for the animals, the planet and our health.<br/></p><p></p><p>Namaste!</p></div>","VeganTrainer Studio

The following lifestyle diseases are claiming an unnecessary, and nearly preventable toll on Canadian's health (in no particular order) obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and kidney disease.  These diseases are often connected to acidic diets, that lack nutrients and that overly focused on animal products with excessive animal protein and animal fat and processed foods and sugars. Healthy eating may be best achieved with a plant-based diet, which 
we define as a regimen that encourages whole, plant-based foods and 
discourages meats, dairy products, and eggs as well as all refined and processed foods. - Kaiser Permanente Journal, 2013. This journal article goes on to say that research shows ""that plant-based diets are cost-effective, low-risk 
interventions that may lower body mass index, blood pressure, HbA1C, and
 cholesterol levels. They may also reduce the number of medications 
needed to treat chronic diseases and lower ischemic heart disease mortality rates. Physicians should consider recommending a plant-based diet to ALL their patients, especially those patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or obesity."" The journal article notes that ""perhaps out of all the diets out there that have been used to treat chronic illnesses, the best but perhaps least common may be those that are plant based… Despite
 the strong body of evidence favoring plant-based diets, including 
studies showing a willingness of the general public to embrace them, 
many physicians are not stressing the importance of plant-based diets as
 a first-line treatment for chronic illnesses. This could be because of a lack of awareness of these diets or a lack of patient education resources."" This is where VeganTrainer Studio steps in to partner up as an educator, facilitator, and centre for empowerment from a holistic approach to help Canadians regain their health in conjunction with their health care provider(s).In the US, the Department of Agriculture responsible for dietary guidelines notes that, ""...If 
the Committee actually discussed this research, it would be unable to 
justify its recommendation to eat meat, as the research would show that 
meat increases the risks of chronic diseases, contrary to the purposes 
of the Guidelines. Thus, by simply ignoring that research, the Committee
 is able to reach a conclusion that would otherwise look improper."" In Canada, most of the work is centred around the Canadian Food Guide that is a bit more proactive than the US version, although it is really close in its acceptance of the consumption of meat, dairy and eggs.  Unfortunately, the conflict of interest exists between the organization(s) that is/are supposed to promote health and the ones that promote food industries. The latter are often that are often lobbied by the marketing boards that represent each industry - and push their product into the food policy of the government, as well as, often receive large subsidies from government making their food more readily available at a lower cost than market value. This forces the pushing of its level consumption at the detriment of the health of the general population. You can even see this now with the new studies that conclude that eating eggs is like smoking, and that milk does not do the body good. This is great marketing, but bad science!VeganTrainer Studio as noted will provide personal to group nutritional training, counseling and education workshops around food preparation, juicing and cooking. VeganTrainer Studio will also offer other services around food including Shopping Tours, Meal Planning* and Shopping Services.  Dietary help is key to helping us avoid become the statistical norm that large numbers of Canadians are used to hearing about. VeganTrainer Studio's motto of Optimal Nutrition represents a desire to break away from the chance of becoming a lifestyle based statistic into becoming an empowered actor in ones own life. The choice to live life healthfully is in one's hands and it begins with what one eats.VeganTrainer Studio seeks to provide the best in Personal, Partner, and Small Group Training including Bootcamps in Toronto. With our focus on functional/body weight workouts we seek to optimize your every day performance where it counts -- in your everyday life. Whether you are a beginner, intermediate or a weekend warrior, there is a space for you at VeganTrainer Studio to help you push yourself beyond what you are used to not only to perform better by carrying your own weight, but to be at your best through our focus on Optimal Training. Through the use of other functional movement/dynamic based implements such as TRX suspension trainers, Kettlebells, and VIPR or BOSU we hope to push you further once you have achieved mastery over your own weight. Training will be provided in either 1) Personal basis and 2) Supervised basis. The former is what we have come to know as 'Personal Training' and the latter is more like bootcamp instruction or an alternative for those who already have a program from another Certified and Insured Personal Trainer but need assistance and support without being as meticulous as Personal Training.VeganTrainer Studio realizes that the every journey begins with a single step. Just as a business begins with a single idea. Many hours have gone into this project and many more will go into it into the future. Your support is greatly appreciated at making this multipurpose space a reality. VeganTrainer Studio will be delivering high quality services and products to assist you not just to regain your health, but to optimize it. At VeganTrainer Studio we want you to partake with us on this journey. Together we can bring a better lifestyle outlook forth for many Torontonians at affordable rates thanks to the magic of group training.VeganTrainer Studio is our pilot project on Indiegogo. We are proud to be part of this amazing community of individuals that support through their own version of micro-lending to fund ideas that are worthwhile. We have committed ourselves to work 12 hours a day since we believe that we cannot do it without you, as much as we believe that you probably will not do it with us. VeganTrainer Studio has taken the leadership to stand out from the rest and is here to support the downtown core becoming healthier and more active because we do not want to be part of the lifestyle statistics. We truly believe that people do not want to be unhealthy or inactive, but that people need to find something that suits their character, their outlook on life, schedule and their ethics. We are here for you. We recognize that our bodies have the ability to heal - given the proper nutrition, and proper movement.How Else Can You Can Help?We recognize that some of you may not be able at this time to contribute financially although you agree wholeheartedly with VeganTrainer Studio's purpose and mission. We have not forgotten that your contribution is as important if not more important than money. We remind you that without you we cannot build a better world and that it not only takes money to make things happen, but awesome inspiring and amazing people like you. So, you are wondering how you as a single person can help? Well, pay it forward. Send this to at least 3 other people and ask them to do the same and to keep it going for as long as they can. We request that you take the time of day when you can during the next 40 days to tell your friends, family and loved ones about VeganTrainer Studio. Even tell those people that are not your friends, like co-workers you may not be too close with, who may benefit, bosses whose companies could use corporate wellness programs, or just a stranger on the street with whom you strike a conversation whether it be around eating clean eating or needing more physical activity in your life. We at VeganTrainer Studio need to make lots of buzzzzzzzz since this is the first space like this of its kind in Toronto, and probably Canada. VeganTrainer Studio was inspired by the work of numerous other vegans out there. Many of them are doctors, activists, and other professionals and their work is relentless primarily for the animals, but secondarily for the planet and lastly for our own existence as a species including our health. We at VeganTrainer Studio ask you to get out there and get the word out and spread the word as noted earlier. Feel free to use your social media, your telephones, emails, slow mail, or any of the Indiegogo share tools! Once again, we thank you! We look forward to offering you our services in the near future and helping you become a person that thrives to help us make this a better world for the animals, the planet and our health.Namaste!",1.0,0,"3 Campaigns

I am the mother of twins, Austin and Aidan, a boxer and a full-time sports television professional. As the 2015, 154 lb. NY Daily News Golden Gloves Champion, I have earned a spot on the USA Boxing Metropolitan Association Team to represent New York at this year’s National Golden Gloves in Ft. Lauderdale, FL! I wasn't sure that I would be able to compete at Nationals until just now! It was not easy arranging a full week of care for Austin and Aidan while I compete, but thanks to family and some amazing friends we've worked it out! <br/></p><p>USA Boxing Metro will cover <i>some</i> costs, but I still need your help to achieve my goal! I need to cover costs for my trainer Lee Shabaka's travel, hotel and training expenses. </p><p>Working towards this goal has been a roller coaster. It's very difficult to manage a household, work full time and pursue my goals as an athlete. There are a lot of ups and downs as I struggle to find ""balance"", which for me looks more like a ping pong ball bouncing from one thing to the next than a balanced scale. I do my best to honor my family life, work and boxing as they are all important to me. </p><p>I not only represent female boxers, when I step into the ring I represent all women, mothers, career women, people who struggle with their weight, those who feel like they are in over their heads and those who struggle with depression and a  fear of failure. I represent everyone who bites off more than they can chew, yet do it anyway. Parenting, working and boxing are not easy to balance, but my success in the ring thus far is proof that it is worth the effort.</p><h3><b><i>MY JOURNEY...</i></b></h3><p>In 2002, at the age of 21, my coach Lee Shabaka, introduced me to his boxing and kickboxing club, <a href=""http://teamfreeform.com/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Team Freeform</a>. He built me up as a boxer from scratch, pushed me to reach my full potential and trained several national and international champions during his career. After my first year of training, I fought my first fight in the 2003 NY Golden Gloves. I lost a close decision to the current NATIONAL CHAMPION, but I was proud of my performance, and Lee was sure that I had the makings of a champion. <br/></p><p></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435085072/cnawtiasx6pwr1r3ukcy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">My Setback</span><br/></p><p>But life got in the way.  In 2003 I took an eight year layoff!

After the show, I had the bug in me, the desire to achieve a dream that I’ve been thinking about since my first match in 2003.  Over the past three years I have competed with the best female boxers in NY across two divisions.

Holy moly, that's coming right up! <b>We invite you to be an instrumental part of building this modern, upbeat yoga center. </b>Please help us by donating and engaging in this campaign! </b><p><br/></p><h3>The Mission:</h3><h3></h3>Mudra is a haven where busy folks actively unwind and rejuvenate through inspired yoga practice.<p><br/></p><h3>The Low Down:</h3>
<p>Mudra will provide a hip, retreat-like ambience where students can engage
with yoga in a fun, supportive, non-competitive and inclusive environment.
Mudra will remain forward thinking and professional in regards to marketing,
technology use, and service approach. In recognition of the busy people who
will likely be drawn to this studio, Mudra will focus on products and services that
cater to hectic lifestyles. As an example, classes offered will be limited to
an hour long so that folks can get a great workout and get on to the other
important practices in their lives.<br/></p><p>The Owner, Heather Nelson, is a Yoga Alliance Registered
Yoga Teacher and long-time yoga practitioner.  While a full-time
professional and parent, Heather formulated a vision for Mudra as a yoga studio
that would allow busy people the quality space to decompress and reenergize. </p>
So much of society demands façades
that can make a person feel inauthentic or drained. Mudra is dedicated to
creating an authentic experience that meets clients where they are and supports
individual growth without the grueling expectations that can exist in other
areas of their lives.<p><br/></p><p>Mudra will be a vibrant and welcoming space that will
allow all of you with hectic lives to take time for yourselves, yet still give
you the time to move on to your other important life practices – be those
family, school, work or play. <br/></p>
<p>Contributions to this campaign will be used for the ongoing, ecofriendly renovation of the studio space. Funding has already been secured and saved for starting up the
business, purchasing materials and equipment, hiring teachers, leasing the
space, planning implementation; the list goes on and on… However, there are
always unforeseen costs and one of these lies in the ongoing hip and ecofriendly renovation
to the space. I am asking for your help in raising $6,500 - $7,500 for completing
renovations.  funds will ensure that Mudra starts off on a solid foundation and becomes a sustainable, community serving business.  </p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p> <p>Your donations will go straight into funding ecofriendly renovations including the installation of a LED lighting system and recycled content ceiling panels, low VOC and recycled materials, and quality fixtures.</p><p>In return for your generous donation, Mudra has created perk packages that include sincere gratitude, stickers, yoga passes, Mudra tanks and tees, yoga mats and invites to the grand opening fiesta! I will also personally practice a vinyasa for every donation made while thinking about the generosity of each of you who give (for a yoga practitioner, this is an equivalent to""dancing a jig"" in celebration).
