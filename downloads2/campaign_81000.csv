Hello New World People
Welcome to my Indiegogo crowdfunding page for my upcoming album and its release! 

This is what moves me:
We live in a time of upheaval and change. The usual constants of our daily life change or disappear entirely. Familiar structures dissolve and fear and insecurity easily arise. As always, the question is: what do we do with it?
For me this is the time of remembering my true self and finding a connecting within me and beyond these structures. Music plays an important roule in my live - and not just during this time. There is something “magical” about music: it affects us beyond language barriers and (cultural) borders and therefore it has a connecting function.
My intention as a musician is to move people across cultural, religious and social boundaries. The songs of the album are just like us, the people of our planet: colourful and with various backrounds they combine different musical styles and genres.I would like to contribute the gifts that I have and help making this world a little better.
 

Four reasons to support this campaign: 

Each of us has something to offer that brings some love and confidence to the world. For me it‘s music. I believe that positive music can contribute to a better world.
Musicians have had a difficult time in the past few months. By sponsoring the project you enable me to pay the studio musicians and producers involved appropriately.
As soon as there is some calm in the concert industry I will tour with the newest music of my album to make you dance, dream and come back to live again. Until then you can already book exclusive studio shows here and enjoy the new songs live via livestream.
I will give the excess money to other local funding projects in order to support other musicians to get through this bumpy time.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm so excited about my new album of music for kids and families, <i>Exclamation Point! </i>I'm in the midst of recording it right now, and want to invite you to be an early supporter of the project. The goal of this campaign is to offset the production costs, by pre-selling the album while it is still in production. I'm aiming to raise $4,000 (roughly half the total production expenses), These funds will help cover the cost of paying the hardworking musicians who lend their time and talent to make these songs really shine. Plus it will help cover studio/engineering fees, graphic design services, and duplication costs.</p>
<p>By pre-buying the new album, you will be among the first to hear it, and will be supporting a great team of independent artists! How cool is that? The price of the album is $20, I'd be psyched and  grateful if you picked up a copy. And if you are interested in contributing more to this project, your generosity is most welcome. Thanks so much!</p>

<h2>Hi friends and new friends,</h2>
<p><strong>Those of you who know me, know I’ve been making my living as a singer in the music industry</strong> for years.  I am super grateful that I have been fortunate enough to do this!</p>
<p><strong>It has always been my dream to record an album of my own songs</strong> and I have been working with my producer/co-writer 3x Grammy winner Shannon Sanders for a few years. Now we are making a full-fledged album (a big undertaking!) and I’d love your support. </p>
<p><strong>The money raised will be used for </strong>the extensive studio and production costs, musicians, mixing and mastering, CD duplication, and artwork.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve got some awesome songs and if you feel so inclined you can pre-order the CD.</strong> I will also have merch available in the form of T-shirts and coffee mugs based on my first single which is called ""Rise Again"". We have a great perk from Peter Asher and I have some fun virtual shows available too!</p>
<p><strong>Thanking you in advance for any help you can lend and all your support throughout the years.</strong></p>

<h3>About Still Forever</h3>
<p>Still Forever was conceived in February 2016 by visual artist turned electronic music producer Amelia Griffiths (that’s me, hello!)</p>
<p>Following a formal education and lifelong practice in visual art and photography, I reignited a childhood interest in music after becoming interested in electronic music production through a new circle of friends. Originally, I just wanted to learn a few basics, to add a new dimension to my art installations, but soon, the sound became the focus and I wanted to know more and more.</p>
<p>I’m self taught, with help from a broad community of really amazing people, who have at times gone out of their way to assist my learning, whilst never treating me as anything less than a fellow musician. I appreciate and adore those folk beyond belief.</p>
<p>After a year or so of experimenting with sounds, software and hardware, a lot of trial and error, a huge learning curve, and a three track EP,  the idea of doing this crazy thing live became a more prominent topic, and I made my live debut opening Manchester’s Foundations Festival in late 2018, after which followed a regular live schedule across the country, sharing a bill with established artists such as Zanias, God Module, Sheep on Drugs and Deviant UK. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616699235/vrllxlehfnmfb8pz7x4f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I’m hoping you will help me to raise the money to fund the release of Synaesthetic, the third full album from Still Forever, and something which has become far more than just the music. Synaesthetic captures the evolution of sound which has naturally occurred through the combined experiences of self taught production, a background in visual art, and live performance, and by choosing to release it in book format ties together the multidimensional aspect of it as a complete body of work, whilst also offering supporters something tangible, visual, even (dare I hope) collectible. </p>
<p>I’m looking to raise a minimum of £800 to release Synaesthetic. The money will be put towards the costs incurred as I approach the completion of the album production process; professional vocal recording session hire, mastering, and of course physical merch (book printing, t-shirts, etc) and promotion. </p>
<p>If you have any questions at all, please do ask.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a new artist, I’d usually have spent the past year and a bit continuing to promote myself through live performances, and selling merch and music to put back into the costs of creating more. Circumstances have meant that all artists have had to find alternative ways to promote themselves and grow, but even for an established artist, it can be a challenge to sell online at anywhere near the volume you’d usually sell at events. I’m fortunate that as a solo artist, it’s been easier for me to rehearse and create in these times, and that my day job has been largely unaffected. On the flip side, though, it means that I’m covering the costs of production myself, without live events to properly promote physical sales which would help me to break even. </p>
<p>I create and perform for the absolute love of it, and never expected to even come this far - I’ve got no illusions about ever making a living from doing this, and I’m comfortable with that. Simply breaking even means that I can put out not only this album, but work on the next, and the next. It means I can play more shows in different cities, and it means I can keep creating new work to share with you. You can make an enormous contribution by investing what you can in this album, or by sharing this page or the music and videos with your friends and family.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The album is written, and it will be released in August. Raising funds towards the cost of putting it out simply means that I’m not edging into debt, and it means I can offer something truly special to supporters of my work. I’ve spent a long time working out a timeline, building in safety buffers to deadlines, and balancing budget plans. The suppliers I’ll be using are well regarded suppliers who I’ve worked with before. Every step has been carefully considered to help this project run smoothly to completion. </p>

<p>Lets get down to it:  I'm a woman on a mission, and to complete the mission, I need a van.  Some of you may have read my <a href=""https://samanthachurchmusic.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>. which gives a decent overview of how this mission began, and how I've ended up here, but to summarize:  </p>
<p><b>My mission: To continuously be creating new and better music.  To bring that music to people from all walks of life, regardless of their ability to pay.  To give people a reason to stop and listen to one another.  To achieve all of this in a self-sustaining, low impact manner.  To inspire others to do the same.</b></p>
<p>This brings us to THE VAN.  The van is a live space, a rehearsal space, an eventual  recording space, and the horse and buggy that's gonna tote this act around!  The van is the lynch pin of the mission.  </p>
<p>Life as a musician is unpredictable.   We can all agree that art betters a community, particularly when it is made available to everyone regardless of ability to pay, but it's harder to agree on how to fund it and sustain it.  <b>I believe I've found a way to ensure I can devote my life to my mission: by reducing what I need to the bare minimum, by combining spaces, by merging my life and my art into ONE MAGICAL VAN!</b></p>
<p>Now all I need is the van!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Having already secured the majority of the funding I need, I'm now asking for an investment of $3,000 to really make this dream a reality.</div>
<div>And I say ""investment"" because that's what it is!  Not only are you making it possible for me to continue making music on a pay-what-you-will basis for those who can't afford to pay, but when you contribute, I contribute back directly to you!</div>
<div>For instance, depending on what you contribute you get:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Free downloads of my music!</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Personalized youtube videos of me covering your favorite song with a personal shout out!</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>A song touting you or your business' GREATNESS written by yours truly! </b></div>

<div><b>A free show at your house party or place of business!</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And more!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>UPDATE:  Here is a specific breakdown of how the money will be used:</b></div>
<div>I found a van that fits the bill.  It's the one pictured above.  It is used, but not endlessly old (it's a 95).  It's in working condition.  It has some miles on it (100,000), but not ALL of the miles on it.  It is driveable, it is liveable, it is what I need.  And it's $7,800.  I have secured $6,000 of that.  It is possible that I won't get this specific van if I don't act fast enough, but there are others comparable in that price range.</div>
<div>Why that price range?</div>
<div>Because below that, vans tend to be enormous fixer-uppers that ultimately cost more.  To get something newer or with less miles means a huge price jump.  This is the sweet spot.  The most bang for your buck.  And this is why I've settled on this price range.</div>
<div>But wait a second--If the van costs $7,800, and I have $6,000 already, why do I need $3,000?</div>
<div>To account for registration, insurance, AAA, gas, etc.  There are a lot of miscellaneous fees that come with buying a van.</div>
<div>What happens if you make more than $3,000?</div>
<div>Everything still goes into the van and making music.  Money will be put aside for repairs.  If I magically make a lot more than anticipated, then the eventual goal I had of  turning the van into a recording studio will come faster.  Beyond that, if the van is in perfect condition and there is money left over, the money will be put into paper goods and distribution--ALL money will go towards spreading my music, first with the van, and then beyond.  </div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The impact of this venture is both big and small, lofty and personal to people.  Street performance, when done in service of the community, BETTERS the community--<b>it increases tourism, it fosters an environment where people engage with one another face to face, it brings art to those who might not otherwise be exposed to it, it takes out the middle man between artists and audiences, and best of all, it adds something special to the day to day.</b>  The van helps me to bring my music to more and varied people.  It allows for me to focus on putting out the best work possible, rather than sacrifice time that should be spent writing, rehearsing, performing to other matters.  It fosters a system that is self sustaining--the more I can travel, the more I can work, the more I can sustain traveling and working.  It makes for more contacts, which can help me to reach more people.  It's a relatively small investment up front that will enable me to create art for years to come.  You can go to my <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/samanthachurchmusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a> and look under the user posts to read the personal impact my music has had on people.  But beyond the personal connections I've made and can make through music, this is a project that shows what is possible to people, how we can think outside the box to create a big impact on society.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This is a project I've been working on for some time.  I tried to do it alone, and have come to realize that you cannot help the world around you without the support of the world around you.  And I've also learned a great deal in the process.  At it's heart, this is a simple project.  If I can travel, if I have a work space, if I have a living space, then I can do my best work possible for the greater good of all.  And combining these spaces, makes it simpler still.  Vandwelling isn't easy, but I've been researching for over a year.  Street performance is a tricky business, but it's one that I've been mastering for three years.  Contacts are needed, but I've been building up a base of people ready to lend a hand when the going gets tough.  With your help, I'm ready for the this big next step!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Hey, man--I'm ALL about pay what you can!  It's my own personal business model, and nobody understands more than me that sometimes you just can't afford to give!</p>
<p><b>But you can still help by spreading the word, sharing my story and my music.</b>  First thing's first--a vehicle is required.  But once I have that vehicle, contacts across the nation can only help my cause!  You never know who among your friends can help, and your emotional support goes a longer way than you know!</p>

<span>Hi there:) Thanks for clicking onto my page!</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>I'm currently working on my very first EP album, and I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am to be able to share this with all you beautiful people! I have had these songs trapped in my head for years now, and it feels so good knowing that I am finally on my way to turning them into something real and tangible for other people to enjoy and experience.  This is my first step toward my dream, and it's finally starting to feel like it's within reach.  I can't really put into words how that feels, but it's the best feeling I can imagine:)  I hope if you decide to help fund my album, you'll get to experience that same feeling through my music.  That's my number one goal.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Here's The Deal</h3> <p>For my album, I'm asking all of you amazing people to help me fund the leftover costs that I can't cover myself.  Recording an album requires way more than I initially thought, so after finishing  a big chunk of the album, I realized I was going to need some help to be able to complete the project.  The money raised will be going towards my studio time so I can finally get these songs out of my head and into your hands! I have a lot of fun perks that I'll be offering for those who want to help me out: a signed physical copy of the album BEFORE it's released to the public, autographed posters, VIP tickets to the release party, and a ton of other fun shenanigans.</p>
<p>I can't stress enough that every penny counts! I know I'm asking for a big chunk of money here, but whatever we're able to raise will get me that much closer to finally being able to pursue my passion.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>This is my first time ever recording and putting out music.  While I've been playing shows and writing for a while now, this is all a totally new experience for me. And with new experiences come some major bumps in the road...and you better believe I've already managed to find a lot of those bumps... BUT, it's all part of the learning experience, right?!  This whole process is terrifying (in the best way possible) and risky, and you can never 
be sure what the outcome will be.  But if you love it enough, like I do, 
the risk is well worth whatever the reward may be.  So, I'm giving this my best effort, and I'm already so happy with the way things are turning out.  I really believe in the music I'm making and I hope that you will too:)<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you're like me and are a little short on cash, don't worry about it!! That's totally understandable. No judgement here!  There are so many ways you can help out and make a difference.  Even just using the IndieGoGo Share options and helping me spread the word about the campaign would be HUGE! I wish I could hug each and every one of you for even reading this far, let alone making a donation! For now, we shall cyber hug:)<br/><br/>I hope you've enjoyed this long, emotional, random rant that I've provided for you:) Thanks for your time, and thanks for believing in me! I promise to make this album count!<br/>

There are perks to being a really indie label... We don't have to be mindful of so many eyes watching from higher-up's so we can go crazy with the music we put out to make sure you get to hear only the freshest tunes. Also, working out of our bedrooms guarantees our right to work without pants on.

So we'll be needing a little boost from you to help us get our feet on more solid ground.


What We Need and What You Get
As a token to the artists who've trusted us with their music and to our fans who've trusted us to put out great music, we're putting together a compilation in vinyl LP format containing the best singles in our catalog from our half-decade of existence.  Unfortunately, though there's been a recent resurgence of the medium,

Call us ambitious but we're hoping to help elevate our city's music scene via this project.

First and foremost, where the heck is Cebu City? Cebu City is a second-tier city in the Philippines, located right smack in the middle of the archipelago-nation. ""Vibrant"" would be a nice thing to say about it, but we're honestly just a bunch of nice people out to have fun, hopefully drawing a little bit of positive attention to our town in the process. Here's a Wikipedia page for you.

What tracks are you planning on putting on the LP? We don't have a definite tracklist at the moment, but scroll further down this page for the profiles of a few of the bands that we'll definitely be featuring. Of course, suggestions are highly welcome - just browse through our Soundcloud for singles we've released so far.

I admit I'm really into vinyl just for the cover art. Concepts so far? 

We want to make the LP cover art as memorable as possible even with the limitations of what our supplier can do and we're very fortunate to have signed up Inodoro Graphic Design, a one-man studio who has done commercial work as far out as Japan and has been featured in an exhibit all the way in London, to create the art for this project. To the left, you will find an initial concept of the ""motion"" art that Inodoro has in mind.



For the record (pun intended), here are a few of the people you'll be helping out...

First off, a few of the bands that will be featured on the LP:




Honeydrop is a post-rock band with a whole lot of pop sensibilities. They launched their debut album ""Prelude"" in October of 2013 with some of the tracks making it as far as Massachusetts via online radio and media outlets. The second album from the band is now a work in progress, with a single set to release soon.
Albums: Prelude


Bombo Pluto Ova is without a doubt the most irreverent and, with five albums of various shapes and sizes in tow, the most prolific in the lineup - a noise band that has been making the same loud and offensive music to a cult following since the beginning of their decade of existence.
Albums: Phantom, Aorta Gun


Tiger Pussy is a punk rock group with a soft spot for classic riot and a strong following in punk communities across the country. Known for their infectious live energy, the band has been making the rounds in various cities in the country since launching their second album ""People You Hate"" in 2013.
Albums: People You Hate




Loop is an indie rock band from Iligan City, a hub to the south of Cebu in the Mindanao group of islands, currently making waves with their brand of Pinoy rock infused with their own local flavor. They are one of the few bands in the roster that are not currently based in Cebu, but definitely an act we will always look forward to seeing in town.

My name is Jenni Auvenshine and I'm the founder of Sing n' Sprout.  As a Children's Ministry Director, I learned pretty quickly that preschoolers loved music and they loved to move.    If I put a Bible verse to music, it was easier for those young children to remember it throughout the week.  I knew that song was firmly planted in their hearts when they came back the next Sunday and could sing it by heart.</p>
<p>It was easier for me to write songs containing Bible truths and verses than it was for me to find them on itunes.  Soon, I recognized how easily songs were coming to me and how effective and fun our young children were having during the music and movement time in Sunday School. Therefore, one day, I had to ask God what He was up to.</p>
<p>He reminded me of the traditional music and movement class I took my daughter to when she was three-years-old.  Even thought the program was excellent, there were two things I believed it was missing:  1) Affordability--As a struggling young family, the price of this class really stretched our pocket book.   2) Faith-based--I loved the music we sang, however, the entire time, I wished we were singing about God, planting seeds of faith in my daughters heart.</p>
<p>Keeping these things in mind, the Lord spoke to me and said, ""I want you to start a Christian music and movement program that ministers to the mind, body AND SPIRIT of the young child.  One that is affordable to take and easy for anyone to teach.""  After hearing Him, I asked Him what the program would be called, and I quickly heard Him speak in my heart, ""Sing n' Sprout: Growing with God through music.""</p>
<p>One year later, out of obedience to God's call, I had the songs recorded and curriculum written.  Mercy Church, was kind enough to offer the very first Sing n' Sprout classes.  They filled up immediately and two mom's asked if I could train them to teach Sing n' Sprout in their community.  </p>
<p>That was three years ago, today, we have over 33 teachers in 10 states who have taught over 850 children and their caregivers in Sing n' Sprout classes held in churches, daycares, rec centers, living rooms and orphanages.  Internationally, Sing n' Sprout has been taught to young children in an American compound in Doha, Qatar as well as to over 40 orphans in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Most of our teachers are moms who desire 1) A kingdom purpose  2) Additional revenue that makes it easier for them to be a stay-at-home mom &amp; 3) A product that is in desired and makes a difference in the lives of their community.</p>
<p>Sing n' Sprout has developed products and services to meet market demand.  We have the volunteer leadership team to support them.  It is now time<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> to take Sing n' Sprout to the next level.  Your contribution will help us share the love of God through music and movement, planting seeds of faith in Jesus Christ, by connecting teachers with children and children with God.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get </span></p>
</div><div> <p>We need $75,000 to share the love of God with over 50,000 children. </p>
<p>We want to reach, train, and support 500 new Sing n' Sprout teachers in the next two years.  That breaks down to investing $150 into each new teacher.  On average, our teachers teach 100 children over a two year period.  Simply and powerfully put, we estimate that $150 invested in each teacher is a kingdom investment in the hearts of over 50,000 children.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website--Update and upgrade!  My amazing step-dad, an honest-to-goodness rocket scientist, bought a book, ""Coding for Dummies"" when I asked him to build Sing n' Sprout's first website.  That website helped us ""beta-test"" our product nationwide this last year.  Now we need to make an appointment with the professionals to update and upgrade.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi! My name is Jenni Auvenshine and I'm the founder of Sing n' Sprout.  As a Children's Ministry Director, I learned pretty quickly that preschoolers loved music and they loved to move.    If I put a Bible verse to music, it was easier for those young children to remember it throughout the week.  I knew that song was firmly planted in their hearts when they came back the next Sunday and could sing it by heart.
It was easier for me to write songs containing Bible truths and verses than it was for me to find them on itunes.  Soon, I recognized how easily songs were coming to me and how effective and fun our young children were having during the music and movement time in Sunday School. Therefore, one day, I had to ask God what He was up to.
He reminded me of the traditional music and movement class I took my daughter to when she was three-years-old.  Even thought the program was excellent, there were two things I believed it was missing:  1) Affordability--As a struggling young family, the price of this class really stretched our pocket book.   2) Faith-based--I loved the music we sang, however, the entire time, I wished we were singing about God, planting seeds of faith in my daughters heart.
Keeping these things in mind, the Lord spoke to me and said, ""I want you to start a Christian music and movement program that ministers to the mind, body AND SPIRIT of the young child.  One that is affordable to take and easy for anyone to teach.""  After hearing Him, I asked Him what the program would be called, and I quickly heard Him speak in my heart, ""Sing n' Sprout: Growing with God through music.""
One year later, out of obedience to God's call, I had the songs recorded and curriculum written.  Mercy Church, was kind enough to offer the very first Sing n' Sprout classes.  They filled up immediately and two mom's asked if I could train them to teach Sing n' Sprout in their community.  
That was three years ago, today, we have over 33 teachers in 10 states who have taught over 850 children and their caregivers in Sing n' Sprout classes held in churches, daycares, rec centers, living rooms and orphanages.  Internationally, Sing n' Sprout has been taught to young children in an American compound in Doha, Qatar as well as to over 40 orphans in Rwanda.
Most of our teachers are moms who desire 1) A kingdom purpose  2) Additional revenue that makes it easier for them to be a stay-at-home mom & 3) A product that is in desired and makes a difference in the lives of their community.
Sing n' Sprout has developed products and services to meet market demand.  We have the volunteer leadership team to support them.  It is now time to take Sing n' Sprout to the next level.  Your contribution will help us share the love of God through music and movement, planting seeds of faith in Jesus Christ, by connecting teachers with children and children with God.

What We Need & What You Get 
 We need $75,000 to share the love of God with over 50,000 children. 
We want to reach, train, and support 500 new Sing n' Sprout teachers in the next two years.  That breaks down to investing $150 into each new teacher.  On average, our teachers teach 100 children over a two year period.  Simply and powerfully put, we estimate that $150 invested in each teacher is a kingdom investment in the hearts of over 50,000 children.
Your contribution will help us with the following:

Website--Update and upgrade!  My amazing step-dad, an honest-to-goodness rocket scientist, bought a book, ""Coding for Dummies"" when I asked him to build Sing n' Sprout's first website.  That website helped us ""beta-test"" our product nationwide this last year.  Now we need to make an appointment with the professionals to update and upgrade. Even though our teachers are independent, our website serves as our ""headquarters"".  This ""one-stop-shop"" will make it easy for families to find and register for classes and for teachers to receive training and support.
Advertise--Our key to solving the demand for classes is to raise up more teachers.  We need to get the word out to churches and moms about this opportunity.
Expand our curriculum--For the last 3 years we have been rotating 2 curriculums.  Because Sing n' Sprout is affordable and faith based, they keep signing up for class despite repeating the curriuculum.   But we cannot keep going on like this.  Our dream is to for a child to participate in a Sing n' Sprout class every semester from the time they are new born through five years of age.  This requires a variety of curricula  each designed with great intention to minister to the mind, body and spirit of the young child at every stage of their development.

    To Be Honest Sing n' Sprout was created on a shoe-string budget.  We have a product that has been tested and is in demand.  To be honest, we could continue to grow the way we have been growing.  Slow and steady.  
Challenges:
1) Limited curriculums: The problem is we have only two curriculums that teachers continue to teach year after year.  We have an audience that WANTS more from us.  They want to have a new curriculum each semester. They want to bring their children to Sing n' Sprout as soon as they are born and keep coming back until they start Kindergarten.
2) Limited classes:  We also have an ""in box"" full of moms asking if they can sign up their child for classes.  The problem is, we need to raise up more teachers.  We want to do that by advertising on Facebook and annually going to the ""MOPS (Mothers of Preschoolers) convention.""
3) Limited communication:  Right now, teachers handle class registration independently.  What if we had a website that handled all class registration? Not only would it make the teachers life easier, it would bring in more revenue (keeping us in business), as well as provide us with a database of Sing n' Sprout families.  We will be able to provide information about upcoming classes as well as send them our ""Sing n' Sprout at Home blog"" which provides spiritual growth ideas through music and movement as a family.

</p><p>Hi. My name is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/peterbrunetteNH"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peter Brunette</a>, and I
am singer/songwriter from Lakeport, New Hampshire. Since my childhood in the 1970s, I've written
hundreds of songs, and the lyrics of the best ones, the ones that I was
especially fond or proud of, I  have lovingly transcribed by hand into a nicely bound
blank book. In 1980, when I first collected all my songs into the Songbook, I named
the collection after one of the songs, “Crystal Images.” Over the years, I played
some of these songs publicly, and a few became staples of my solo
singer/songwriter repertoire. When I started out, I said that I was going to
record an album someday, but life got busy, you know, marriage, child-rearing,
careers, hustling to make ends meet—my music was never a significant source of
income, a hobby really, and an expensive one at that—and that album never got
recorded. </p>
<p>Today, at 57 years of age, I finally
decided that it was time for my dream to become reality. With the loving
encouragement of my family and closest friends and after countless suggestions
and offers of help from my musician buddies, I am finally taking the Songbook
into the studio to make an album. Studio recording is a new thing for me, and I
knew that I needed to find a producer, someone with whom I could collaborate,
someone with chops, the necessary technical knowledge and, more importantly, a
similar attitude and outlook on life and music. And after looking all over New England,
by the grace of God (and Facebook), I found him, almost right next door, in the
person of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ryan.ordway.1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ryan Ordway</a>. Ryan is a young man with an extensive resume as a
songwriter, producer, recording artist and touring musician, and he has built a
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/resortrecordings?fref=nf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">studio</a> in Gilford, just over the hill from my home. Better yet, he is starting
a Recording Cooperative, a studio run by and for musicians, and I would very
much like to join. <br/></p><p>By becoming a member of the Cooperative, I will be able to
record my songs in partnership with some of the best musicians in the area, and
continue to do so for years to come. It’s affordable, but well beyond my means,
as I am living, as most folks I know are, paycheck to paycheck. The total cost
of buying into the Recording Cooperative, recording, mixing, mastering, and manufacturing
the album, including cover art and promotion, is estimated at $7,000….a minor
expense for the big recording artists, but a small fortune for me…but I think I
can scrimp and save and pull together about $2000, leaving me $5000 short. That’s where you come
in.<span>  <br/></span></p><p><span>Through crowdfunding, I can take
collaboration on this Project to a new level, and all of you can take part in
producing the record. Not only will your donations make it possible, but as the
project progresses, you can participate in various ways, by sharing the Indiegogo
campaign with others, by attending events at the studio or performances in
local venues, and by commenting on the rough tracks as we post them online. So

   What We Need & What You Get 
As an independent band, this is the work of blood, sweat and tears of a band with a passion for keeping Cajun music alive! We need your help for National distribution, marketing and publicity. Get the new album. Want more? We've got it! T-shirts, posters, mugs, workshops and private Skype lessons to name a few.     The Impact 
By successfully funding this album, through YOUR contribution, we will be able to market and promote the record, promoting our heritage and culture to the world!    Risks & Challenges 
We are a completely independent band with no big labels backing us. If we don't reach our funding goal, we may not be able to successfully impact the release of our new album Voyageurs. By your contribution, we will be able to fund our marketing and distribution of the album independent of a label.

</blockquote><div>
<p>Caleb is one of my heroes from the bible.  He accomplished the greatest feat of his life at an advanced age...an age when many others  give up or  think of retiring.  But like Caleb, I truly believe that age is no barrier to fulfilling goals as evidenced by some like Diana Nyad who at age 64, after five failed attempts over a 35 year span, fulfilled her lifelong dream of swimming from Cuba to Key West!!  Or Tom Watson just months shy of his 60th birthday almost winning the British Open beating all competitors, some almost 40 years younger, except one!  </p>
<p>For the 
past thirty years I have had a dream to be a professional tour golfer. At every opportunity I have 
practiced and played to improve my game. I  caddied on the North Florida 
tour and for Arnold Palmer's Bay-Hill tournament for a few years when we lived in the 
Orlando area. However, my family has always been a priority so much of my time 
was spent providing for them, putting my dream on ""hold"" for the most part. Time, family obligations and circumstances have not diminished my desire. With both my son and daughter recently completing college I sense now is the time to move forward ""full steam"" with this dream.  To ""cross over and possess the land""!!</p>
<p>I have a 
good game but do not have a great “pedigree” like many other players. I am more like 
the “Rocky” Balboa of golf but will not give up until I see this God-given dream 
come to fruition! This has been the burning passion of my heart for the past thirty years!  I keep myself in excellent physical 
condition and practice even during the winter months. I 
truly believe that given the chance to practice full-time (which I am now doing), enter “mini-tour” 
events and with  ""hands 
on"" professional instruction, this 
dream will become a reality.</p>
<p>What 
is holding me back now is not time constraints but resources. I estimate it will 
take about $40,000 per year to cover living &amp; travel expenses, entry fees for tournaments across the Southeast, practice rounds, range fees, equipment, plus lessons with a professional instructor when necessary. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  <b>I am beginning this quest by playing in mini-tour events in Central Florida starting in July.  As I succeed I will proceed/progress to other tournaments eventually entering Champions Tour Qualifers and Q-School.</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>This may seem like a daunting task but trust me, If I wasn't firmly convinced I could
attain this goal I wouldn't risk sharing it with you.
By financially partnering with me  it is my sincerest desire that it will be an inspiration to
others to pursue their dreams; regardless of the obstacles or how long their dreams have been deferred!<b> Any donation is greatly appreciated and no donation is too small!</b>!</p>
<p></p>
<div>Thank you for giving my request your time and consideration. </div>

take about $40,000 per year to cover living & travel expenses, entry fees for tournaments across the Southeast, practice rounds, range fees, equipment, plus lessons with a professional instructor when necessary.   I am beginning this quest by playing in mini-tour events in Central Florida starting in July.  As I succeed I will proceed/progress to other tournaments eventually entering Champions Tour Qualifers and Q-School.

This may seem like a daunting task but trust me, If I wasn't firmly convinced I could
attain this goal I wouldn't risk sharing it with you.
By financially partnering with me  it is my sincerest desire that it will be an inspiration to
others to pursue their dreams; regardless of the obstacles or how long their dreams have been deferred! Any donation is greatly appreciated and no donation is too small!!

Thank you for giving my request your time and consideration. 

“Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.""  - Thomas A. Edison

Join our campaign and create a dynamic and exciting contemporary music &amp; arts initiative in Kampot, Cambodia.

</b></i></span></p><p><span><b></b>
</span></p><p><b>In brief: </b><span>This campaign is to raise funds needed build
and equip a dynamic community arts venue in Cambodia. KAMA (Kampot Arts &amp;
Music Association) is an initiative to promote and present contemporary art and
music in Cambodia. To achieve our vision we aim to raise $10,000 to implement
KAMA’s first annual music program and equip KAMA’s live music venue and
schedule a minimum of 12 special concerts. <br/>
<br/><b>How and why KAMA?</b><br/>
KAMA is an initiative of The Cambodian Space Project founder Julien Poulson to
foster, develop, mentor contemporary musicians and artists from disadvantaged
and under-represented sectors of the arts community in Cambodia. KAMA is not
simply asking for your donations to its cause but is offering great
made-in-Cambodia products for sale here, by purchasing these ‘perks’ you
directly support the opening of our first annual music program and KAMA venue. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Full description:</b><span>In
December 2009, I formed the group The Cambodian Space Project with Khmer
vocalist Srey Channthy. At first, our aim was simply to play a couple of shows
at a friends bar, however, CSP soon became known as an exciting, cross-cultural
music group leading an important cultural revival in Cambodia. Five years on,
this small beginning has lead to some incredible opportunities, not least,
exporting the new sounds of Cambodia to the world and championing our local
musicians. </span></p>
<p>Along the way, CSP has regularly donated time and money to
support causes we believe in, particularly supporting social arts programs;
we’ve performed in jails, public libraries, HIV clinics, Human Rights events,
at schools and charities and have often set-up our own free concerts in poor
and disadvantaged villages. KAMA is a way for us to continue this work under-the-one-roof,
where we can use our own professional expertise to creating, presenting and
marketing new talent. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1189079/files/20150201195558-Cambodian_space_project_004.jpg?1422849358"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote>""KAMA is my vision to give back to the community where I've had the good fortune to live and work in for a number of years while producing music and art work centred around the incredible journey of THE CAMBODIAN SPACE PROJECT.

</p><p>Located directly opposite the 2000
monument in downtown Kampot, we’ve set-up shop in fabulous (dilapidated)
colonial era building. It’s a large place on the corner of a downtown block
where the ground floor will become known as <b>KAMA
KAFE – </b>operating as KAMA’s retail outlet with an art gallery and music shop
that stocks locally made product.
Upstairs includes more gallery space as our open arts studio <b>KAMPOT KREATIF </b>–
a pubic access open studio that includes print making workshop, music rehearsal

</span></p><p>Today, Cambodia has a far more
impressive music and art scene than when CSP began 5 years ago. In a place
where culture itself was decimated by a genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, Cambodia’s
present day cultural revival is astonishing. However, Cambodia is still a
country where most of the population lives in extreme poverty, and
opportunities for education and/or meaningful employment are beyond the reach
of most.  Music and arts can make a huge difference in such an
environment. Many of our local musicians and artists we encounter have little
opportunity to develop their practice, to professionalize and to connect with
an audience and most do not even own their own instruments. Music and arts
programs (like sports programs) are often the great leveller in disadvantaged
communities where individuals have little education and less opportunity to
find meaningful roles in society. </p>
<p>KAMA will focus on championing new
arts as a form of expression for the people who hail from backgrounds of
poverty and disadvantage. The opportunity to be involved in music and arts
provides hope and happiness, transformation and empowerment and celebrates the
creative potential of all people. We believe in a world where creativity,
expression, and opportunity, is valued, accepted, respected and available to
all. </p>
<p></p><p></p><h4><i>
By creating “KAMA ” we aim to draw on our own experience (with The Cambodian
Space Project) to build a contemporary music and arts space where individuals
can meet and share their ideas and experience and ultimately create fresh and
original new music. KAMA can nurture and mentor talent while working to create
performance opportunities through matching musicians with the appropriate
venues and professional pathways.

</span></p><p>To begin this journey, KAMA has
secured a 10-year lease of an fabulous colonial building situated in the centre
of Kampot, Cambodia. It is a venue where we will manage an annual program of
music workshops, performances and exhibitions. At KAMA we open our doors to
both local musicians as well as international guests in the belief that this
exchange will provide a world-view for our local talent. It is also a great
opportunity for our International guests to connect with and experience the
incredible music and arts culture of Cambodia. Note: The costs in establishing
KAMA, equipping and managing the total building space is self-financed and
supported by our retail shop, however, the funding we seek is specifically to
establish KAMA’s live music program and venue.</p>
<blockquote><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;"">""I feel that the experience
accumulated through 5 years of working with The Cambodian Space Project will be
something that can be shared and used to build a great program at Cambodia’s
first contemporary music centre – Music Arts Space Kampot. To make this work,
we need to raise the money to equip, staff, and facilitate our vision – we need
your help."" </span></blockquote><p></p><p><b></b>
</p><p><b>Why is this campaign important to us &amp; our community:</b><br/>
This is the beginning of something new and important. From our own experience of
living and working in Cambodia, we recognise that most professional musicians
are bonded to an employer or have little opportunity to branch out as
independent artists. Often young musicians have little or no knowledge of the
world outside Cambodia and have no awareness of the world of music beyond their
own village. We believe that the model we have created for The Cambodian Space
Project – a freedom to write and perform new music and to successfully connect
with professional industry as well as an international audience – can work for
the many talented local musicians we have encountered along the way. KAMA is an
initiative by the CSP to focus on the next generation of talent in Cambodia. </p>
<p>In October this year <i>The
Cambodian Space Project</i> took residence in Kampot town to create a ‘rock
opera’ titled “Hanuman Spaceman”.  To do
this we brought together a mix of international and local artists, some already
at professional level while others novices. Over a three-week period, “Hanuman
Spaceman” took shape via a program of workshops, rehearsals and performances.
The focus - experimenting with new music ideas, mixing Khmer traditional sounds
with 60’s rock’n’roll and electro-hip-hop beats. Our work in the community
resulted in new creative relationships as well as paid employment for a range
of technicians, venue operators, musicians and arts workers.  By staging
“Hanuman Spaceman” in a small community, we can demonstrate how an accessible
community arts projects can lead to meaningful outcomes -  made locally but at the same time, appealing
to an international audience.</p>

<h4>Current work in development:</h4>
<h4>Sticky Fingers Art Prints Cambodia, Bokor Mountain Magic Band,
CSP, Kampot Music festival, Kampot Writers Festival, Kampot Khmer Ensemble,  </h4>We have a range of art and music initiatives in developing under the KAMA umbrella. This includes: Sticky Fingers print making workshop. At KAMA we will have
the space to set-up a new studio to employ our local artisans as well as the
potential to host international artists to share their skill and print their
own editions. Our Sticky Fingers art prints are leading the way for creating
pop art imagery on Cambodian themes, the work is exhibited and represented at
galleries internationally and sells quickly. Sticky Fingers is a 'hands on'
initiative and is part of our ethos - that music, visual arts, culture should
be easily accessible to everyone. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119324/files/20141227170120-Screen_Shot_2014-12-27_at_10.25.32_PM.png?1419728480"" src="""" style=""width: 417.976580796253px; height: 417px;""/><br/><p><b><br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
To open our doors and get started we need to equip and
staff our venue space. The aim of this campaign is to raise $10,000 USD to
implement our first annual music program. This investment will quickly allow
our program to become self-sufficient by returning income through the
establishment of a retail shop, gallery space and a venue for public
performances.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119299/files/20141227164113-Show_1_-_24_framed_copy.jpg?1419727273"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h2>

<b>Instruments: $1500</b><br/>

$1500 to purchase an

(Xylophone), Khim, a setoff circular Gongs, 3 x Tros (one string violin),
Chapei Dong Veng (long neck Lute), Khmer drums and percussion. Note: very few
local musicians own their own instruments, this set of instruments will allow
us to run a program of traditional music workshops and performances.  <p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119277/files/20141227162137-Khmer_instruments.jpg?1419726097"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Employment $2400</b><br/>

to pay for equipment for a good quality vocal pa – we have a high quality
mixing desk (donated by CSP) but need to add PA speakers and monitors, a power
amplifier, effects rack, microphones and stands. The equipment will be
purchased in Cambodia and will provide a professional sound system for
performers to use in our own venue as well as at other locations.   
<br/><b><br/>Print media and artist promotion $1600<br/></b>
Across
our annual program we will design and print a series of limited edition screen
prints for each and every artist presented by KAMA. The idea is to create
highly collectible poster art for our artists and audience and to generate work
and income for our print making studio. These images will be used to promote
our artists online through social media. $1600 covers costs of materials,
papers, inks, etc (not wages) for the printing of 1200 ltd editions.</span></p><p><span><b>Annual music program $2400<br/></b></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
KAMA
will program a minimum of 12 concerts annually at a cost of $2400. We seek
funding support for artist fees at $200per event. Additional artists' income
will be made up from audience donations and/or sales or food, drink,
merchandise. By securing an annual budget for staging music events it will mean
we can afford to program unique and rarely seen performers who may not
necessarily attract a large audience. Our music events will be well promoted
and free-of-charge. </span></p><p></p>

</p><p>If
we’re unsuccessful in meeting our funding target we will still be spendin every
dollar raised to kickstart KAMA. If we reach a smaller target than expected
then we will have to decrease the size of our first annual programme. However,
we will still open and be in a better starting position with the funding we
raise via this campaign. </p>
<p>The Impact</p><p>Over the past five years the music and arts projects that I've been personally involved in in Cambodia have made a huge impact on the emerging arts scene. CSP vocalist Srey Channthy's rise from the rice fields of Prey Veng to the World's Stage is an incredible success story and is one that gives hope and influences other young artists in the local community. Through CSP we have created international networks and employment opportunities for many of the individuals we work with in Cambodia as well as bringing experienced arts professionals to Cambodia to work with us in our local community. KAMA is a way to 'umbrella' our work in community and to establish an arts centre with the kind of long-term-vision that will make a great impact and become renown for its work at home and abroad. </p><p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p><p>Our biggest challenge is financing (it's ongoing) and ensuring our professional work remains viable and effective over the long-term. This year CSP celebrates it's 5th anniversary and with this longevity we will establish KAMA with a 10 year plan. To achieve our vision we will need to continue to fund raise for our not-for-profit programme as well as commercialise and raise income from art and music that we can produce to sustain operating costs at KAMA. In a crowded fundraising market, this is not an easy task and takes a full time commitment to managing. <br/><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/>Good karma!<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">If you can’t contribute financially you can

music in Cambodia. To achieve our vision we aim to raise $10,000 to implement
KAMA’s first annual music program and equip KAMA’s live music venue and
schedule a minimum of 12 special concerts. 
How and why KAMA?
KAMA is an initiative of The Cambodian Space Project founder Julien Poulson to
foster, develop, mentor contemporary musicians and artists from disadvantaged
and under-represented sectors of the arts community in Cambodia. KAMA is not
simply asking for your donations to its cause but is offering great
made-in-Cambodia products for sale here, by purchasing these ‘perks’ you
directly support the opening of our first annual music program and KAMA venue. 

Full description:In
December 2009, I formed the group The Cambodian Space Project with Khmer
vocalist Srey Channthy. At first, our aim was simply to play a couple of shows
at a friends bar, however, CSP soon became known as an exciting, cross-cultural
music group leading an important cultural revival in Cambodia. Five years on,
this small beginning has lead to some incredible opportunities, not least,
exporting the new sounds of Cambodia to the world and championing our local
musicians. 
Along the way, CSP has regularly donated time and money to
support causes we believe in, particularly supporting social arts programs;
we’ve performed in jails, public libraries, HIV clinics, Human Rights events,
at schools and charities and have often set-up our own free concerts in poor
and disadvantaged villages. KAMA is a way for us to continue this work under-the-one-roof,
where we can use our own professional expertise to creating, presenting and
marketing new talent. ""KAMA is my vision to give back to the community where I've had the good fortune to live and work in for a number of years while producing music and art work centred around the incredible journey of THE CAMBODIAN SPACE PROJECT. "" - Julien Poulson (founder of CSP, Sticky Fingers Art Prints Cambodia)

Where
and what is KAMA?
Located directly opposite the 2000
monument in downtown Kampot, we’ve set-up shop in fabulous (dilapidated)
colonial era building. It’s a large place on the corner of a downtown block
where the ground floor will become known as KAMA
KAFE – operating as KAMA’s retail outlet with an art gallery and music shop
that stocks locally made product.
Upstairs includes more gallery space as our open arts studio KAMPOT KREATIF –
a pubic access open studio that includes print making workshop, music rehearsal
rooms, cinema and office space. 
Why do it?
Today, Cambodia has a far more
impressive music and art scene than when CSP began 5 years ago. In a place
where culture itself was decimated by a genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, Cambodia’s
present day cultural revival is astonishing. However, Cambodia is still a
country where most of the population lives in extreme poverty, and
opportunities for education and/or meaningful employment are beyond the reach
of most.  Music and arts can make a huge difference in such an
environment. Many of our local musicians and artists we encounter have little
opportunity to develop their practice, to professionalize and to connect with
an audience and most do not even own their own instruments. Music and arts
programs (like sports programs) are often the great leveller in disadvantaged
communities where individuals have little education and less opportunity to
find meaningful roles in society. 
KAMA will focus on championing new
arts as a form of expression for the people who hail from backgrounds of
poverty and disadvantage. The opportunity to be involved in music and arts
provides hope and happiness, transformation and empowerment and celebrates the
creative potential of all people. We believe in a world where creativity,
expression, and opportunity, is valued, accepted, respected and available to
all. 

By creating “KAMA ” we aim to draw on our own experience (with The Cambodian
Space Project) to build a contemporary music and arts space where individuals
can meet and share their ideas and experience and ultimately create fresh and
original new music. KAMA can nurture and mentor talent while working to create
performance opportunities through matching musicians with the appropriate
venues and professional pathways. 

Instant KAMA!
To begin this journey, KAMA has
secured a 10-year lease of an fabulous colonial building situated in the centre
of Kampot, Cambodia. It is a venue where we will manage an annual program of
music workshops, performances and exhibitions. At KAMA we open our doors to
both local musicians as well as international guests in the belief that this
exchange will provide a world-view for our local talent. It is also a great
opportunity for our International guests to connect with and experience the
incredible music and arts culture of Cambodia. Note: The costs in establishing
KAMA, equipping and managing the total building space is self-financed and
supported by our retail shop, however, the funding we seek is specifically to
establish KAMA’s live music program and venue.
""I feel that the experience
accumulated through 5 years of working with The Cambodian Space Project will be
something that can be shared and used to build a great program at Cambodia’s
first contemporary music centre – Music Arts Space Kampot. To make this work,
we need to raise the money to equip, staff, and facilitate our vision – we need
your help."" 
Why is this campaign important to us & our community:
This is the beginning of something new and important. From our own experience of
living and working in Cambodia, we recognise that most professional musicians
are bonded to an employer or have little opportunity to branch out as
independent artists. Often young musicians have little or no knowledge of the
world outside Cambodia and have no awareness of the world of music beyond their
own village. We believe that the model we have created for The Cambodian Space
Project – a freedom to write and perform new music and to successfully connect
with professional industry as well as an international audience – can work for
the many talented local musicians we have encountered along the way. KAMA is an
initiative by the CSP to focus on the next generation of talent in Cambodia. 
In October this year The
Cambodian Space Project took residence in Kampot town to create a ‘rock
opera’ titled “Hanuman Spaceman”.  To do
this we brought together a mix of international and local artists, some already
at professional level while others novices. Over a three-week period, “Hanuman
Spaceman” took shape via a program of workshops, rehearsals and performances.
The focus - experimenting with new music ideas, mixing Khmer traditional sounds
with 60’s rock’n’roll and electro-hip-hop beats. Our work in the community
resulted in new creative relationships as well as paid employment for a range
of technicians, venue operators, musicians and arts workers.  By staging
“Hanuman Spaceman” in a small community, we can demonstrate how an accessible
community arts projects can lead to meaningful outcomes -  made locally but at the same time, appealing
to an international audience.

Current work in development:
Sticky Fingers Art Prints Cambodia, Bokor Mountain Magic Band,
CSP, Kampot Music festival, Kampot Writers Festival, Kampot Khmer Ensemble,  We have a range of art and music initiatives in developing under the KAMA umbrella. This includes: Sticky Fingers print making workshop. At KAMA we will have
the space to set-up a new studio to employ our local artisans as well as the
potential to host international artists to share their skill and print their
own editions. Our Sticky Fingers art prints are leading the way for creating
pop art imagery on Cambodian themes, the work is exhibited and represented at
galleries internationally and sells quickly. Sticky Fingers is a 'hands on'
initiative and is part of our ethos - that music, visual arts, culture should
be easily accessible to everyone. What We Need & What You Get
To open our doors and get started we need to equip and
staff our venue space. The aim of this campaign is to raise $10,000 USD to
implement our first annual music program. This investment will quickly allow
our program to become self-sufficient by returning income through the
establishment of a retail shop, gallery space and a venue for public
performances.
Here’s
where money goes: 
Instruments: $1500

$1500 to purchase an
entire set of high-quality Khmer ensemble instruments for our rehearsal and
performance program. These instruments include beautifully made Roneat
(Xylophone), Khim, a setoff circular Gongs, 3 x Tros (one string violin),
Chapei Dong Veng (long neck Lute), Khmer drums and percussion. Note: very few
local musicians own their own instruments, this set of instruments will allow
us to run a program of traditional music workshops and performances.  Employment $2400

$2400
to employ a Cambodian staff member who will work full-time as The Music Space
co-ordinator – facilitating access for teachers, mentors, students, volunteers
and visitors. Staff and maintain our retail shop, security of the premises and
some administration duties including website and social media updates. 

Venue
facilities $2100
$2100
to pay for equipment for a good quality vocal pa – we have a high quality
mixing desk (donated by CSP) but need to add PA speakers and monitors, a power
amplifier, effects rack, microphones and stands. The equipment will be
purchased in Cambodia and will provide a professional sound system for
performers to use in our own venue as well as at other locations.   
Print media and artist promotion $1600
Across
our annual program we will design and print a series of limited edition screen
prints for each and every artist presented by KAMA. The idea is to create
highly collectible poster art for our artists and audience and to generate work
and income for our print making studio. These images will be used to promote
our artists online through social media. $1600 covers costs of materials,
papers, inks, etc (not wages) for the printing of 1200 ltd editions.Annual music program $2400
KAMA
will program a minimum of 12 concerts annually at a cost of $2400. We seek
funding support for artist fees at $200per event. Additional artists' income
will be made up from audience donations and/or sales or food, drink,
merchandise. By securing an annual budget for staging music events it will mean
we can afford to program unique and rarely seen performers who may not
necessarily attract a large audience. Our music events will be well promoted
and free-of-charge. 
This
campaign is NOT just asking for donations.  We are raising funds by offering unique, hand made, limited editions available for purchase online through this Indie Go Go campaign. 100% of sales money goes to making KAMA happen:The Cambodian Space Project vinyl, cds,
t-shirts

Limited edition prints
performances

Where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal?
If
we’re unsuccessful in meeting our funding target we will still be spendin every
dollar raised to kickstart KAMA. If we reach a smaller target than expected
then we will have to decrease the size of our first annual programme. However,
we will still open and be in a better starting position with the funding we
raise via this campaign. 
The ImpactOver the past five years the music and arts projects that I've been personally involved in in Cambodia have made a huge impact on the emerging arts scene. CSP vocalist Srey Channthy's rise from the rice fields of Prey Veng to the World's Stage is an incredible success story and is one that gives hope and influences other young artists in the local community. Through CSP we have created international networks and employment opportunities for many of the individuals we work with in Cambodia as well as bringing experienced arts professionals to Cambodia to work with us in our local community. KAMA is a way to 'umbrella' our work in community and to establish an arts centre with the kind of long-term-vision that will make a great impact and become renown for its work at home and abroad. Risks & ChallengesOur biggest challenge is financing (it's ongoing) and ensuring our professional work remains viable and effective over the long-term. This year CSP celebrates it's 5th anniversary and with this longevity we will establish KAMA with a 10 year plan. To achieve our vision we will need to continue to fund raise for our not-for-profit programme as well as commercialise and raise income from art and music that we can produce to sustain operating costs at KAMA. In a crowded fundraising market, this is not an easy task and takes a full time commitment to managing. Good karma!If you can’t contribute financially you can
still be a huge help by sharing our campaign and getting the word out to your
friends and community. 
Help by becoming a mentor, volunteer,
friend of KAMA. 

Got an old instrument you could send our
way?  We’d love to receive material
support such as instruments or equipment that we could use to grow our
resources and provide to students and musicians – most don’t own their own
instruments as they’re from poor families and extremely disadvantaged
backgrounds. 

Go an arts project you'd like to create in Cambodia? let's work together, we have a vision to host international artists-in-residence.

<div>I grew up in the Philadelphia Foster Care system. Before foster care I was a victim of child molestation, but that does not define me. I was blessed to be adopted into an amazing family and later I got to know my biological family as well. My wonderful adoptive mother died when I was 13 years old after I was in her care for most of my life. I was devastated and lost my way. I started writing in a journal to express my feelings which turned into poetry, and later into songs.  When I got to college I was diagnosed with depression but held on to the love of God through His son Jesus Christ. This is where my song ""Find Me Where I am"" came from. I used to wonder if God could even hear me. My music captures my story through a very unique sound. It is a story of how God has kept me, blessed me, and covered me through the years and how He is longing to do the same for everyone!</div>

</div></div>","""Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden.""      -      Oscar Wilde
With this line, one of the most beloved children's stories in all of literature begins.  As the story progresses, we are introduced to a variety of characters including Hail, Frost, the North Wind, Snow and Autumn in addition to a boy and the titular character - the Giant.  (click here to read to the full story)
My name is Steve Weiser, and I am the GM of the Erie Chamber Orchestra (ECO).  We are a professional orchestra based in Erie, PA with one very simple mission - free music for all.  For 36 years, the ECO has been presenting free concerts to the community, allowing thousands of people to experience classical music for the first time in their lives.  Within the past three seasons, with the appointment of new Music Director Matthew Kraemer, the ECO has experienced a rebirth of sorts with an intensified drive both artistically and musically.  Just this past year, the ECO released its first ever CD, a collection of long-lost silent film music from composer J.S. Zamecnik, entitled the Sounds of the Silents.      Learn more about this project here! 



It was this project that led local Erie composer Stephen Colantti to approach the ECO in the hopes of recording his newly written opera The Selfish Giant.With your help, we can make this dream a reality.  From the composer, Stephen Colantti:I first encountered the story myself as a
small child.  Our family had an old 78rpm
record with the great actor, Frederick March, narrating the story.  My sisters and I played it over and over again
on our old record player.  Obviously,
this story made quite an impression on me since I still remembered it quite fondly
years later when I set out to write an opera.  Now that the opera has been completed, I believe with all of my heart that with the proper recording of this work, audiences from across the world will be able to experience this one-of-a-kind work and benefit from its powerful message.   As you can see - the composer believes in his work.  As do we!We have engaged the following artists to be a part of this project:

The Giant - the renowned, Grammy award-winning Mark S. Doss




Snow - Shannon Kessler Dooley




Frost - Olga Perez Flora




North Wind - James Bobick




Hail - Brent Weber



Autumn - Lisa Layman



Children's Chorus - members from the Cathedral of St. Paul Children's Choir and the Young Person's Choir of Erie

   Expenses

As one can imagine, recoding an opera is no small task.  Our expenses include:
  22 Members of the ECO, 7 singers, a children's choir, equipment rental, sound engineer, album mastering, CD duplication, transportation costs, marketing, etc... Total estimated expenses - $16,514
Our unique relationship within Gannon University allows us to use the recording space for free - a huge savings.  We are also able to handle all printing expenses internally.  There are essentially no overhead costs. 

Impact
One single feature makes this project stand apart from countless others - this will be the first recording in history of this work.  Your support helps guarantee that this new opera is permanently added to the pantheon of music that has existed for thousands of years.  Rare is the opportunity to actually make a tangible difference such as this.  The final product will be available:  As a CD On iTunes and the Amazon Music Store On Spotify and iTunes Radio 
Along with the album itself, a documentary will also be created.  We did a similar film from our first recording session last year, and as you can see, it turned out amazingly well.


   Risks & Challenges While any project such as this has certain built in risks, the ECO is an a unique position in the country in that we exist within a university.  Many of the unforeseen expenses are handled by the school, which allows us to ask for only the help that we need.  With one successful recording already under our belts, we are well aware of just how much work is involved with this type of a project.

</div>
<p><b>Soooo...
what's this all about? </b></p>
<p>Welp,
from April 1st to May 1st (for a total of 720 hours) Chico's musicians are
joining forces to break the current Guinness World Record for ""Longest
Multi-Artist Concert"" which is 15 days &amp; 12 hours. </p>
<p>Yup. You
heard that right. </p>
<p>We're
going to DOUBLE it—live music 24/7 for a whole freaking month. And it's gonna
be filmed. The full-blown documentary will even be pitched to Netflix.
Woot. </p>
<p>Now <i>why
in the world</i> (punny) would this not-so-small, talent-ridden college
town want to attempt such a feat? </p>
<p>Two
reasons:</p>
<p>1. First
and foremost, to brand Chico as the monumental music city it truly is (no
joke... we're talking on par with Portland, Athens, and Seattle), and
secondly...</p>
<p>2. To
quote Mike Justice from local Chico band My Lanta: ""[Attempting to break a
Guinness World Record as a community] is literally the best thing to ever
happen to this town.""</p>
<p>Okay three:</p>
<p>3. To connect other
local music communities across the country and establish a nation-wide
collective (yup... a database of hot music scenes from California to New
York... and Canada, eh?).</p>
<p>But here's the thing:
We can't do this alone. </p>
<p>Obviously. </p>
<p>We <i>need</i> you.
And want you. </p>
<p>Only
with your support will we be able to nationally showcase the plethora of
artistry brewing in our vibrant town and others across the country. </p>
<p>And we know you <i>wanna</i> have
our back yo. Just like we've got yours. </p>
<p>Yeah, you're gonna get
some love.</p>
<p>Read on to find out
how... </p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need
$10,000 and we know exactly where every penny will be spent: </p>
<ul>
<li>The first $2,000 will fund our live online streaming
     videographer and website, production of branded t-shirts, fliers, and of
     course, a fatty tip jar for our 300+ acts.</li>
<li>The next $4,000 will fund our sound and media support
     crew, staff, massage therapist for the VIP area, and a bonus for our
     awesome volunteers, without which you wouldn't even be reading these words
     right now.</li>
<li>The final $4,000 will fund the production of CD's
     and DVD's, decor for the event, ""unforeseen"" expenses (we see
     'em comin'!), and finally, a mini-payday for the o.g. staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here it
is. The love you're gonna get when you support this badass music
movement. Look to the right for the gory details. For now, suffice it to
say you can score:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passes for the VIP lounge which includes that scheduled
     masseuse you read about above, lunches and dinners, couches, and so much
     more...</li>
<li>Photo ops for your and your peeps (or with your band of
     choice!) with our professional photographer on staff...</li>
<li>Packages of postcards or CD's and DVD's with t-shirts
     or hottie girly tanks...</li>
<li>And we can't forget our incredible ""Girl's Night
     Out"" package: 8 VIP passes, 8 Chico Chica Gear tanks, 1 bottle of vodka
     with mixers, a professional group photo in front of the Guinness World
     Record backdrop, and a cab home (too good to be true, we know)...</li>
</ul>
<p>And look, if we don't
make our whole financial goal, what funds we do raise will go straight to the
streaming video and website, memorabilia, and a tip jar for the bands. </p>
<p>But let's not miss all
these other amazing opportunities, k? </p>
<p><b>How
This Will Change the World </b></p>
<p>Imagine a
world where local bands — hubs of musical communities — could easily connect
through the mutual desire to spotlight the lesser known music scenes and provide them more opportunities to perform and be recognized for their genuine talent than ever before. </p><p>THIS is what we hope to achieve in the long run. </p><p>We believe that in today's tech world we can come up with creative ways to benefit ambitious, cooperative musicians across the country. </p><p>This world record attempt is the our effort to set the stage for future attempts in a friendly competition with other amazing towns in the U.S. and Canada. </p><p>Our recent grassroots endeavor to showcase the Chico music scene was a HUGE success—a rockumentary featuring nearly 100 local acts. Premiered at the Pageant Theater on March 1st demonstrated our ability to pull our community together and rally for a greater cause. </p><p>Now we want YOU to be a part of this cause, too. </p><p>Grab a perk and join us in this movement to rock the nation. </p><ul>
</ul>

<p></p></div>","Soooo...
what's this all about? 
Welp,
from April 1st to May 1st (for a total of 720 hours) Chico's musicians are
joining forces to break the current Guinness World Record for ""Longest
Multi-Artist Concert"" which is 15 days & 12 hours. 
Yup. You
heard that right. 
We're
going to DOUBLE it—live music 24/7 for a whole freaking month. And it's gonna
be filmed. The full-blown documentary will even be pitched to Netflix.
Woot. 
Now why
in the world (punny) would this not-so-small, talent-ridden college
town want to attempt such a feat? 
Two
reasons:
1. First
and foremost, to brand Chico as the monumental music city it truly is (no
joke... we're talking on par with Portland, Athens, and Seattle), and
secondly...
2. To
quote Mike Justice from local Chico band My Lanta: ""[Attempting to break a
Guinness World Record as a community] is literally the best thing to ever
happen to this town.""
Okay three:
3. To connect other
local music communities across the country and establish a nation-wide
collective (yup... a database of hot music scenes from California to New
York... and Canada, eh?).
But here's the thing:
We can't do this alone. 
Obviously. 
We need you.
And want you. 
Only
with your support will we be able to nationally showcase the plethora of
artistry brewing in our vibrant town and others across the country. 
And we know you wanna have
our back yo. Just like we've got yours. 
Yeah, you're gonna get
some love.
Read on to find out
how... 
What
We Need & What You Get
We need
$10,000 and we know exactly where every penny will be spent: 

The first $2,000 will fund our live online streaming
     videographer and website, production of branded t-shirts, fliers, and of
     course, a fatty tip jar for our 300+ acts.
The next $4,000 will fund our sound and media support
     crew, staff, massage therapist for the VIP area, and a bonus for our
     awesome volunteers, without which you wouldn't even be reading these words
     right now.
The final $4,000 will fund the production of CD's
     and DVD's, decor for the event, ""unforeseen"" expenses (we see
     'em comin'!), and finally, a mini-payday for the o.g. staff.

And here it
is. The love you're gonna get when you support this badass music
movement. Look to the right for the gory details. For now, suffice it to
say you can score:

Passes for the VIP lounge which includes that scheduled
     masseuse you read about above, lunches and dinners, couches, and so much
     more...
Photo ops for your and your peeps (or with your band of
     choice!) with our professional photographer on staff...
Packages of postcards or CD's and DVD's with t-shirts
     or hottie girly tanks...
And we can't forget our incredible ""Girl's Night
     Out"" package: 8 VIP passes, 8 Chico Chica Gear tanks, 1 bottle of vodka
     with mixers, a professional group photo in front of the Guinness World
     Record backdrop, and a cab home (too good to be true, we know)...

And look, if we don't
make our whole financial goal, what funds we do raise will go straight to the
streaming video and website, memorabilia, and a tip jar for the bands. 
But let's not miss all
these other amazing opportunities, k? 
How
This Will Change the World 
Imagine a
world where local bands — hubs of musical communities — could easily connect
through the mutual desire to spotlight the lesser known music scenes and provide them more opportunities to perform and be recognized for their genuine talent than ever before. THIS is what we hope to achieve in the long run. We believe that in today's tech world we can come up with creative ways to benefit ambitious, cooperative musicians across the country. This world record attempt is the our effort to set the stage for future attempts in a friendly competition with other amazing towns in the U.S. and Canada. Our recent grassroots endeavor to showcase the Chico music scene was a HUGE success—a rockumentary featuring nearly 100 local acts. Premiered at the Pageant Theater on March 1st demonstrated our ability to pull our community together and rally for a greater cause. Now we want YOU to be a part of this cause, too. Grab a perk and join us in this movement to rock the nation. 

Risks
& Challenges
The previous attempts were small-scale in nature and the records for ""Longest Multi-Artist Performance"" were broken by handfuls of artists and bands. At the moment we have 200 acts signed up to perform, so the sheer volume of participants gives us an advantage in succeeding at breaking the record. If, however, we run into circumstances such as: 

Bands taking longer than five minutes between sets (we will have two stages to reduce the chance of this occurring), or 
If a Witness does not show up (we will have on-call Witnesses at the ready in case this happens), or
If we have less than 10 people in the audience at a time (again, our peeps are on-call, even at those odd hours)... 

... we will have to reset the clock. IF we have to reset the clock and it's within the first two weeks, we will still have enough time to break the record! Again, the previous record was 15 days and 12 hours, so we have SOME buffer room if necessary—but we're going to do everything in our power to make the buffer room totally unnecessary. Other Way You Can Support UsDon't have a few bucks to toss our way? How about your awesome self? If you're a Chico local, we want you with us. ""Witnesses""We need TWO official Witnesses in the crowd at all times. Are you a business owner, teacher, doctor, lawyer, nurse, city council member, or otherwise professional person? We'd LOVE to have you be a Witness! Or are you a gung-ho music lover than REALLY wants to see this thing succeed? Consider being an official Witness throughout the month! To be a Witness means you must commit to a four-hour shift and be willing to take notes during your time there. You must not have any affiliation with the band or the event. And you must know we love you for even considering this. <3 Also know that a person can be a Witness more than one time. We're gonna need a lot of support with this one, folks... a whole month of Witnesses. Interested? Sign up here: https://emilyrosecoaching.acuityscheduling.com/... ""Warm Bodies""We're going to need 10 bodies in the crowd at all times—literally ALL times of day and night. This means those odd hours... 4, 5, 6am... Are you a night owl? Come down to the Tackle Box and chill with us there!Maybe you're a morning person and you don't have to be at work until the evening... Com down to the Tackle Box, listen to music, and have coffee and breakfast with our volunteers! (I know I wanna see you down there. ;)Y'all we need A LOT of non-musical volunteer help to make this happen.So please pitch in any way you can.

</div></div>","Short Summary Ciao a tutti! Siamo Federico, Fabrizio e Davide; tre anni fa abbiamo iniziato un'avventura.Prima per gioco, poi sempre più sul serio, abbiamo creato una nuova web radio. Bandit Rock Radio è nata un pomeriggio, uno di quelli in cui non sapevamo bene cosa fare. Come al solito ascoltavamo e discutevamo di musica. Amiamo il rock ma qui in Italia, secondo la nostra opinione, di rock non ne viene trasmesso mai abbastanza... ci siamo detti, perchè non provare a fare anche noi qualcosa. Così nasceva Bandit, nel marzo del 2013.Abbiamo pubblicizzato e portato la trasmissione in giro, ma limitandoci a mantenerla nel giro degli amici... ora vogliamo provare a diventare grandi e abbiamo bisogno di una grossa mano per la nuova stagione. 
Per chi non ci conoscesse, forse una presentazione è doverosa: siamo tre ragazzi di quarant'anni, con l'amore per la radio. Già, la radio; proprio quel mezzo romantico, con quel sapore un po' vintage ma, come qualsiasi cosa che regala emozioni, vivissima tutt'oggi e quotidianamente vissuta da milioni di persone che, come voi, ascoltano musica e parole in macchina o in ufficio, nei negozi o direttamente in cuffia grazie al cellulare. 
Il nostro sogno si chiama Bandit Rock Radio. E' un progetto musicale, come dicevamo, nato dalla passione per la musica e dall'amore per il rock.Ispirato all’esperienza dell’emittente svedese Bandit Rock, punta ad allargare gli orizzonti del panorama rock in Italia, proponendo un format radiofonico che porta gli studi della trasmissione direttamente nei locali, con djset trasmessi in streaming via web radio.   What We Need & What You Get Vogliamo che il nostro progetto cresca e sia sempre più un punto di riferimento per chi ama il rock, il divertimento e le emozioni più pure. Desideriamo che la forza della musica riesca a raggiungervi sempre, nella maniera più ottimale possibile, in ogni momento e sotto qualsiasi forma, regalandovi anche nuove sorprese.Come ogni progetto radio, per essere riconosciuto e pienamente in regola,  necessita della registrazione in SIAE e di altri atti burocratici minori. Ovviamente questi contratti vanno rinnovati ogni anno. Si presentano poi una serie di costi di gestione continui, che anche con la nostra passione infinita, non sono semplici da riuscire a contenere. La cifra che vogliamo raggiungere è di 1500 euro, che comprende: l'iscrizione per 1 anno alla SIAE, altri costi burocratici, un ampliamento della discografia di album in digitale ad uso di Bandit e alcuni minimi costi di gestione che una radio via web presuppone, come il dominio internet, lo spazio hosting, i costi di streaming etc. Vi chiediamo quindi, ove possibile, di aiutarci a sostenere queste cifre e a rinnovare il mondo della musica in Italia. Anche con un singolo euro. 
Un caffè per Bandit, potremmo dire. 
    Risks & Challenges Ah, ma se la campagna non raggiungesse la cifra prevista, che cosa succederebbe?
Nulla di preoccupante, anzi.La cifra indicata è l'ammontare totale che serve per questo primo anno di registrazione, ma qualsiasi numero riusciremo a raggiungere grazie a voi, sarà utilizzato nel migliore dei modi per la vita di Bandit. E per favorire la riuscita di questo progetto, lasceremo aperta la campagna di fundraising per un ulteriore periodo di tempo.
    Other Ways You Can Help Se non riuscite o non volete contribuire economicamente alla campagna, ma riusciste a supportarci condividendo, pubblicizzando e parlando in giro di questa nostra iniziativa, ve ne saremo infinitamente grati e vi ameremmo molto.In più, cerchiamo dei locali dove poter portare in trasferta la nostra radio, facendo, come vi abbiamo raccontato, delle trasmissioni in diretta, via web streaming, direttamente dalla location esterna: quindi se conoscete qualche situazione del genere da proporci o conoscete qualcuno che ne sa, ci dareste una grossa mano.         SPREAD THE LOVE  SPREAD THE WORD  LONG LIVE ROCK'N'ROLL

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">    Hey there, my name is Bob Minner and I'm an acoustic guitarist. For 23 years I have played rhythm guitar for country music superstar Tim McGraw and I have also performed and recorded as a solo acoustic guitarist. I have recorded 4 albums with Tim McGraw - ""Tim McGraw &amp; The Dancehall Doctors"", ""Live Like You Were Dying"", ""Let It Go"", and ""Southern Voice"". I also have one solo CD out - ""There &amp; Back &amp; Back Again"" which received critical praise from numerous music industry trade publications. I have performed throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, and Rome, Italy, as well as appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman, The Grammy's, American Music Awards, CMA Awards, ACM Awards, as well as other TV shows. I have been featured in Flatpicking Guitar magazine numerous times and enjoyed a feature article in issue # 34 of the prestigious Fretboard Journal Magazine. I love playing guitar! I am married to my wife Ginger for 26 years, with two grown children, and we live in beautiful Mt. Juliet, TN with our dogs and cats.</span><br/></p>
<h3>Why This Campaign Is Important To Me</h3>
<div>  I grew up in church, and one thing that was a constant was the old hymns. This is way before the modern ""praise &amp; worship"" movement. Those old hymn melodies and lyrics are timeless. In fact, more often than not, when I am on tour on the bus or a hotel room, I always find myself playing these old hymns as a source of strength, relaxation, and taking me back to a simpler time in my life. And if you grew up in church or know someone who did, these songs will ring even truer with what I said.</div>
<div>  I meet thousands of fans a year on tour, and those that are familiar with my solo guitar work have been asking me for some time now to do a stripped down acoustic instrumental album of these timeless hymns. It seems these great hymns are important to a  lot of people, and I would love to honor their requests. And so here we are, about to begin a very important project to me, and one that's dear to my heart - Six String Sanctuary - The Acoustic Hymns Project.</div>
<div>   It will feature 13 timeless hymns performed on acoustic guitar, mandolin, tenor guitar, and resonator guitar. The song list (not in final order) is:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Holy, Holy, Holy<br/>
</li>
<li>Blessed Assurance</li>
<li>It Is Well</li>
<li>What A friend We Have In Jesus</li>
<li>I Need Thee Every Hour</li>
<li>Power In The Blood</li>
<li>There Is A Fountain</li>
<li>Great Is Thy Faithfulness</li>
<li>Come Thou Font</li>
<li>On Christ The Solid Rock</li>
<li>'Tis So Sweet</li>
<li>Nothing But The Blood of Jesus</li>
<li>Be Thou My Vision</li>
</ul>
<div>    It is my desire to offer a final project of great acoustic guitar hymns played in a stripped-down manner that you can listen to as you read a morning devotional, reading scripture, praying, or just wanting music that is familiar and relaxing when you need some quiet reflective time in the morning with your coffee or after a hard day. I cannot stress how important this project is to me. It's really a big part of how I grew up. And I truly want to bless everyone who helps me reach my goal.

<div>  As for perks, I have got some really cool ones I think you will dig.

</div></div>","Who I Am - A Guy Who Plays Guitar
    Hey there, my name is Bob Minner and I'm an acoustic guitarist. For 23 years I have played rhythm guitar for country music superstar Tim McGraw and I have also performed and recorded as a solo acoustic guitarist. I have recorded 4 albums with Tim McGraw - ""Tim McGraw & The Dancehall Doctors"", ""Live Like You Were Dying"", ""Let It Go"", and ""Southern Voice"". I also have one solo CD out - ""There & Back & Back Again"" which received critical praise from numerous music industry trade publications. I have performed throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, and Rome, Italy, as well as appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman, The Grammy's, American Music Awards, CMA Awards, ACM Awards, as well as other TV shows. I have been featured in Flatpicking Guitar magazine numerous times and enjoyed a feature article in issue # 34 of the prestigious Fretboard Journal Magazine. I love playing guitar! I am married to my wife Ginger for 26 years, with two grown children, and we live in beautiful Mt. Juliet, TN with our dogs and cats.
Why This Campaign Is Important To Me
  I grew up in church, and one thing that was a constant was the old hymns. This is way before the modern ""praise & worship"" movement. Those old hymn melodies and lyrics are timeless. In fact, more often than not, when I am on tour on the bus or a hotel room, I always find myself playing these old hymns as a source of strength, relaxation, and taking me back to a simpler time in my life. And if you grew up in church or know someone who did, these songs will ring even truer with what I said.
  I meet thousands of fans a year on tour, and those that are familiar with my solo guitar work have been asking me for some time now to do a stripped down acoustic instrumental album of these timeless hymns. It seems these great hymns are important to a  lot of people, and I would love to honor their requests. And so here we are, about to begin a very important project to me, and one that's dear to my heart - Six String Sanctuary - The Acoustic Hymns Project.
   It will feature 13 timeless hymns performed on acoustic guitar, mandolin, tenor guitar, and resonator guitar. The song list (not in final order) is:


Holy, Holy, Holy

Blessed Assurance
It Is Well
What A friend We Have In Jesus
I Need Thee Every Hour
Power In The Blood
There Is A Fountain
Great Is Thy Faithfulness
Come Thou Font
On Christ The Solid Rock
'Tis So Sweet
Nothing But The Blood of Jesus
Be Thou My Vision

    It is my desire to offer a final project of great acoustic guitar hymns played in a stripped-down manner that you can listen to as you read a morning devotional, reading scripture, praying, or just wanting music that is familiar and relaxing when you need some quiet reflective time in the morning with your coffee or after a hard day. I cannot stress how important this project is to me. It's really a big part of how I grew up. And I truly want to bless everyone who helps me reach my goal. So whether it's just for you, or a family member or friend that you think would love this project, I appreciate you taking time to stop by and visit, and any contribution is appreciated. It blesses me and I am sure this acoustic hymns project will be a blessing to you as well.



What We Need & What You Get


  So here's the details now. I am trying to raise a total of $10.000.00. This will cover recording expenses, mixing and mastering, packaging, S&H, promotion and all of the neat perks I have for everyone who particpates as my partner. No fluff, no profit, all of the funds raised in this effort go towards making this the best product it can be.
  As for perks, I have got some really cool ones I think you will dig. The T-shirts are a ""limited edition design"", and I think the personalized video perks (Thank you's and Happy Birthdays) will be a  real treat for those of you who choose them. There's also some Skype perks where we can chat one on one or you can take a guitar class from me.

  As for the funding, I am confident we will hit our goal, but in the event we don't, we will still proceed with the CD project, using what we have and complete it regardless. Having said that, I truly hope you will feel moved to partner with me on this labor of love. 
The Impact - Sharing and Passing It On
   This CD project is near and dear to my heart. First, it's all about how I grew up, as I am sure many of you did as well. But it's also about spreading quality, simplistic approach guitar playing to folks who want something that is easy to listen to. Whether you are familiar with the Hymns or not, I promise you'll enjoy this instrumental project.
  Having been in Nashville for 23 years and played on countless demos as well as four Tim McGraw records, I know what goes into making a great recording. I am looking forward to sharing this with you all, as well as you sharing it with your friends and family.

    
Other Ways You Can Help   I have tried to set the perks at reasonable levels of contribution where you will find real value in partnering, but even if you don't decide to contribute, it would be appreciated if you would share a link to the campaign with your friends and family or Facebook. Share with your church family and pastor / worship leader as well. Every little bit helps on this journey. And be sure to check out the Indiegogo sharing tools on their page!
  And again, thanks to everyone for checking this little project out and taking it into consideration. I look forward to sharing this music with you, my partners.

Hi, my name's Jamison. No one ever spells it or pronounces it right, so you can pretend it's whatever you want. Call me Bob if you want. Anyways, If you know anything about me, then you know I'm obviously passionate about music and want to pursue it like no other. I love writing, recording, performing and have been doing it for years now. So I felt it was time to step out of my comfort zone and actually crowd fund an EP, which I never imagined myself actually doing, but hey here we are.   <br/><p>By donating, you will assist me in moving towards what I care to stay true to. You will be joining me as I take another step in the right direction of what I was meant to do. Music is what I love and it will always be that way. I get such a drive out of it. And what better way to do this than to share it with a bunch of people that want to support my goal?? I don't know, but that thought makes me happy! :D</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We are halfway finished with the EP and need $1,000 to complete it.

WHOA. NUTS. SO COOL, I KNOW! I can't wait, I'm already freaking out just typing this!<br/><p><br/>However, If we do not reach our end goal, we will still use whatever we make for the EP. It's all about the music, people. <br/></p>

The importance of creating and putting this out into the world is because it's simply what we want to do: Make good music that people will appreciate and can jam out to in the car because it's THAT good. We want to pull up next to you at a stoplight and see you doing a full-body flail while blasting our new songs, because then we know we're doing our job. <br/><br/>By the way, I'm not using ""full body flail"" as an example to say I do that when I'm alone in my car or something.....uh..moving on..<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>With every goal that is set to ones mind, comes challenges and risks. We're willing to step out of our comfort zones and actually start a fundraising campaign because we want to try something new - if you don't struggle then you're not growing. Consider this a risk/challenge for us. We're willing to try it though because we have a goal we want to reach.<br/><p><br/>Yes, we could fail at this, but we're going to give it a shot and do what we can anyway. After all, success is not determined by what someone cannot control. Things work out.</p>

If you want to help in another way, simply share this indiegogo campaign on social media a couple times to let people know what's up, or use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p>Hi, I’m Catherine Moon, I’m a singer/songwriter, bhakta, and leader of the musical group “Mystical Kirtan.”  Our goal is to transmit light and love
through sound vibration.  Our vehicle is
uplifting devotional music.</p>
<p>Mystical Kirtan is hosting this fundraiser for our first
full length kirtan album, “The Bridge To Where You Are”</p>
<p>We’ve been receiving an overwhelmingly positive response to
our music in the Northeast and decided it was time to record these original
versions of ancient mantras so fans can bring the music home with them and so
we can get this music out to a much wider audience.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are raising $8,250 to create “The Bridge” and put this
music out into the world</p>
<p>Studio Recording costs: 
  $2,350<br/>
Guest Musicians:    $1,850<br/>
Mixing &amp; Mastering:    $1,500<br/>
Album Artwork Design:    $
500<br/>
Reproduction:    $1,050<br/>
Professional music video  $1,000</p>
<p> As you can see, your thoughtful contribution will be
so helpful in bringing the project to fruition. 
No contribution is too small.  Your
help is immeasurable and we are immensely grateful. </p>
<p>You can simply pre-order the CD or there are some sweet perks
to explore,  including some precious acquisitions
from Moon’s recent trip to India.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music is so powerful; it can be so evocative.  And we are of the opinion that there can
never be too much uplifting music in this world.  Through our music we wish to dispel darkness,
we wish to draw back the curtains and let the sunshine in.  </p>
<p>Through kirtan, devotional call and response chanting, we
have discovered that music can be a vehicle which transports everyone who
listens and participates to a state of bliss, a place of love and light, a
place of healing.</p>
<p>Kirtan is a pathway that leads to union with the
Divine.  Going deeply into the practice
of chanting mantras is a bridge to connecting with our True Selves, our Higher Selves,
our Sacred Selves…hence our album title “The Bridge To Where You Are.”</p>
<p>We’ve been delighted to discover that the music we’ve been
creating has been a bridge, turning a lot of people on to kirtan who were
unaware of this practice. Our approach
to kirtan is unique, in part because the music itself is so accessible to
western ears with its catchy danceable grooves, rock, jazz, blues, folk, and soul all
shining through these songs crafted with love and devotion.  </p>

By supporting this project, you are not only helping to get this album out there, you are making the practice of kirtan accessible to more people, you are participating in growing the Bhakti tribe, you are making the world a better place!<br/><br/>

<p>   Underground Unheard is a DIY non-profit record label based out of Western North Carolina founded by friends and fellow musicians Relik, and Bobby White almost 10 years ago. It was started with the idea that music should be from the heart and for the people.  UU members have worked and recorded with musicians such as Blueprint, DLX, Illogic, Vast Aire, Kool Keith, Sleep, Del the Funky Homosapien, Akil the MC, A-Plus, and many more.<br/></p>
<p>   You might be wondering why there is no video attached to our fundraising campaign like most of the others.  Well, herein lies the purpose of the campaign.  We have gone 10 years producing great, organic music and art with little funds and even less time.  However, we have slowly gained enough support, artists, and fans that it seems time to push for more.  We take great pride in what we are able to do by cultivating strong relationships with like-minded people, treating people well, and coming together as a community to create art that makes people think, dance, and smile. </p>
<p>   Our goal is to cultivate a significant online video presence on sites such as youtube to give our fans more of the content they love on a whole new platform. (By the way, we promise to turn off ALL ads on our youtube videos)</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here's the deal:</p> <ul> <li>We need a DSLR Canon camera, a couple of lenses, extra batteries, extra sd cards, and a tripod, all together costing about $1,000.</li> <li>All donations of $15 or more will be rewarded with special UU swag. Check out the ""perks"" section on this page to see what your donation will get you. </li>
<li>If we reach our goal, we will give a special shout-out to all donors in a ""special thanks"" video. (If we don't reach the goal, we can't make the video.)</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We will also try our best to add/follow ALL donors on their social media pages.</span></li> <li>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will put the funds into an account and continue to save until we can afford the gear we need. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Just a couple reasons why you want to help us buy this gear:</p> <ul> <li>We have so many great ideas just begging to come to fruition. Having a video camera will open a whole new world for us and our fans to enjoy more of the grassroots, DIY, yet professional-quality music and art we have been releasing for years.</li> <li>We have plans to release new material several times a month, whether it be a new single, a music video, an interview, or an artist's video-profile. Having this camera will directly enable us to exponentially increase our output for everyone to enjoy. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are always risks and challenges in life. That's what makes it interesting!</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">   One of our mantras at UU is ""move forward."" For 10 years we have built Underground Unheard with camaraderie, hard work, and the simple blessing of loving what we do.  We do not shy away from risk, we seek it, and we are not afraid of a challenge, we welcome it!</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We, as a group of young artists working day jobs for close to minimum wage, understand that sometimes, you just can't afford to do all the things you might want to do.

   Underground Unheard is a DIY non-profit record label based out of Western North Carolina founded by friends and fellow musicians Relik, and Bobby White almost 10 years ago. It was started with the idea that music should be from the heart and for the people.  UU members have worked and recorded with musicians such as Blueprint, DLX, Illogic, Vast Aire, Kool Keith, Sleep, Del the Funky Homosapien, Akil the MC, A-Plus, and many more.
   You might be wondering why there is no video attached to our fundraising campaign like most of the others.  Well, herein lies the purpose of the campaign.  We have gone 10 years producing great, organic music and art with little funds and even less time.  However, we have slowly gained enough support, artists, and fans that it seems time to push for more.  We take great pride in what we are able to do by cultivating strong relationships with like-minded people, treating people well, and coming together as a community to create art that makes people think, dance, and smile. 
   Our goal is to cultivate a significant online video presence on sites such as youtube to give our fans more of the content they love on a whole new platform. (By the way, we promise to turn off ALL ads on our youtube videos)   What We Need & What You Get Here's the deal:  We need a DSLR Canon camera, a couple of lenses, extra batteries, extra sd cards, and a tripod, all together costing about $1,000. All donations of $15 or more will be rewarded with special UU swag. Check out the ""perks"" section on this page to see what your donation will get you. 
If we reach our goal, we will give a special shout-out to all donors in a ""special thanks"" video. (If we don't reach the goal, we can't make the video.)
We will also try our best to add/follow ALL donors on their social media pages. If we do not reach our entire goal, we will put the funds into an account and continue to save until we can afford the gear we need.     The Impact Just a couple reasons why you want to help us buy this gear:  We have so many great ideas just begging to come to fruition. Having a video camera will open a whole new world for us and our fans to enjoy more of the grassroots, DIY, yet professional-quality music and art we have been releasing for years. We have plans to release new material several times a month, whether it be a new single, a music video, an interview, or an artist's video-profile. Having this camera will directly enable us to exponentially increase our output for everyone to enjoy.     Risks & Challenges There are always risks and challenges in life. That's what makes it interesting!
   One of our mantras at UU is ""move forward."" For 10 years we have built Underground Unheard with camaraderie, hard work, and the simple blessing of loving what we do.  We do not shy away from risk, we seek it, and we are not afraid of a challenge, we welcome it!   Other Ways You Can Help We, as a group of young artists working day jobs for close to minimum wage, understand that sometimes, you just can't afford to do all the things you might want to do. Hence the fundraiser. Here are a couple things you can do to help OTHER THAN donating money: 
Keep being you! :)

</p><p>We’ve got the band!<br/>
We’ve got the venue!<br/>
We’ve got the date!<br/>
Now all we need is YOU.</p>
<p>We've heard what you've been telling us for years, that the real magic of
Mama’s Black Sheep is in the live show. So, we thought we would capture the
passion and energy of a live performance both on film and audio.</p>
<p>We are super excited to embark on this journey with you, to
create an all new multi-media experience as our next full-length release! In
2016 we’d like to bring the live concert experience right into your living room
with a brand new DVD/CD 2-disc set featuring several new and previously
unrecorded original songs, along with a few of our most requested cover tunes!<br/>
<br/>
After discussing our venue options, we
have decided to record this live concert at The Bevy in Birdtown in the
Cleveland, OH Metro area. We have set the concert date for November 6th, 2015.
This will be a full band show with Helen Hausmann on Violin, and Robin Elder on
bass. We will be on tour that week with our dear friend singer-songwriter
Christine Havrilla who will be co-billing the show. The Bevy is a beautiful and
intimate space and there will only be 200 tickets available for this live
concert recording event. We encourage all of our fans to come and be a part of the
live audience!<br/>
<br/>
Creating any new release is always an
expensive and time consuming venture. Creating a video in addition to an audio
CD is an extra expense. This is where we need your support. Please become a
contributor today and help us turn our vision into reality!</p>

<p>Hello, Opera and Music Lovers of Boston!</p><p></p><p><b><i>Welcome to the indiegogo page for Opera Brittenica's Third Season!</i></b> Opera Brittenica is undergoing some impressive changes, that we would like to share with you. </p><p>Firstly, we would like to announce that while our residency in Cambridge at <b>St. Peter's Episcopal Church</b> remains, we are thrilled to be simultaneusly in residency with the <b>First Parish of Dorchester</b>. As Opera Brittenica believes that opera should not be socio-economically divided, we are so excited to bring these high-level performances to the drastically underserved neighborhood of Dorchester, in a gorgeous venue such as First Parish. As such, every production that we will produce will be able to be seen in both Cambridge or Dorchester! We so look forward to expanding our reach, and hope to create new music lovers from the partnership!</p><p>Secondly, we have decided that while our focus will be primarily unchanged in our presentation of the works of Benjamin Britten, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge the influence that Britten had on subsequent composers and setters of the english language. To that end, we are expanding our scope to include all composers who composed works in english as the original language from 1913 forward. </p><p>Subsequent seasons could see works by Adamo, Weill, Picker, Bolcom, even Sondheim and Bernstein, or workshopped new works by emerging composers!</p><p>In beginning this trend, we would like to announce the first production of 2015-2016 is a very famous work of one of Britten's Brooklyn roommates, Gian Carlo Menotti's <b>Amahl and the Night Visitors. </b></p>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435762512/xxhksod0t1d15yvpsf5a.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 469.134615384615px; height: 238px;""/></p>
<p>This story follows the three wisemen who are on their way to pay their respects to the newborn baby Jesus, who stop at a small house where a poor mother and her aflicted son live. The production is about an hour long, and was the first televised opera. The production will be staged at both <b>St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Cambridge (December 11, 2015)</b>, as well as <b>First Parish of Dorchester. (December 12, 2015)</b></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't stop here! We need YOU<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, and other generous souls like you, to help us to prove that Opera isn't dead, and that artists are valuable cultural assets! Producing an opera requires much more funding than you would expect, not to mention providing compensation for the talented artists who dedicate their lives and time to these projects. Here is a small list of fundraising issues that we, and every other company face:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Rights &amp; Rentals</b>: Because Benjamin Britten passed away in the 1970s, his material is not yet in the public domain, unlike that of Puccini or Handel. As such, we must request permission from the publishing company.  This includes rental for orchestral parts and principal scores. Depending on seating and ticket prices, this could range from <i>$1,000-$5,000 per production.</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Percussion Rental</b>: As Britten was considerably adventurous in his orchestration for percussion, many of his compositions call for the use of unusual or a vast amount of instruments. Most percussionists do not own their own large equipment, thus requiring the rental of such equipment, often costing upwards of <i>$500-$1,000</i> depending on the repertoire.</li>
<li>
<b>Venue</b>: Fortunately, Opera Brittenica has a reputation for producing edgy and still quality works, in unusual locations, so most concerts are housed churches and museums in the Boston area, however, we will need to donate some percentage of revenue to the church, as well as the rental of any theatre that is used for staged work. </li>
<li>
<b>Production/Marketing</b>: We would love to be able to market to a wider audience, but this costs money as well. The printing of programs, posters, flyers, website hosting, business cards, etc. are expenses that may vary widely from production to production. Looking at the past few years' figures, we have come to expect somewhere in the range of<i> $1,000-$1,500</i> for the season's publicity in printing and publicity. </li>
</ul>

<p>We do, however, completely understand if you are not in a financial position to support us with a monetary donation, but there are myriad other ways that you can help Opera Brittenica in it's everyday activities! Below are some other ways that you can support us!</p>
<p>*Artist Housing - As we are determined to bring the best performance possible to our community, and as talented as our locals are, occasionally, it is necessary that we have a performer come from out of town. This artist would need a place to stay for the performance rehearsals, and performances, and could transition from being an incredible artist, to a life-long friend! Please contact us if you have a bedroom/bathroom within the Boston Metro area (T accessible) that you would be willing to donate to OB!</p>
<p>*Ushers - We always need ushers to help with the box office, and showing guests to their seats! Not only do you act as an ambassador for OB, but you would receive a free opportunity to see the show!</p>
<p>*Marketing assistance - We are fortunate to have the amount of followers that we have, but alas, we cannot know everyone in Boston (Try as we might!) Any opportunity for you to spread the word to your circle of friends and families is more than welcome.</p>
<p>*Sets, Costumes, Props - While we have designers and artists that create the visual elements of the performed works, occasionally we are in search of a specific couch, or lumber, or decorative art work.

Opera Brittenica is undergoing some impressive changes, that we would like to share with you. Firstly, we would like to announce that while our residency in Cambridge at St. Peter's Episcopal Church remains, we are thrilled to be simultaneusly in residency with the First Parish of Dorchester. As Opera Brittenica believes that opera should not be socio-economically divided, we are so excited to bring these high-level performances to the drastically underserved neighborhood of Dorchester, in a gorgeous venue such as First Parish. As such, every production that we will produce will be able to be seen in both Cambridge or Dorchester! We so look forward to expanding our reach, and hope to create new music lovers from the partnership!Secondly, we have decided that while our focus will be primarily unchanged in our presentation of the works of Benjamin Britten, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge the influence that Britten had on subsequent composers and setters of the english language. To that end, we are expanding our scope to include all composers who composed works in english as the original language from 1913 forward. Subsequent seasons could see works by Adamo, Weill, Picker, Bolcom, even Sondheim and Bernstein, or workshopped new works by emerging composers!In beginning this trend, we would like to announce the first production of 2015-2016 is a very famous work of one of Britten's Brooklyn roommates, Gian Carlo Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors. 

This story follows the three wisemen who are on their way to pay their respects to the newborn baby Jesus, who stop at a small house where a poor mother and her aflicted son live. The production is about an hour long, and was the first televised opera. The production will be staged at both St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Cambridge (December 11, 2015), as well as First Parish of Dorchester. (December 12, 2015)


Secondly, in February, we are thrilled to welcome back incredible NYC based harpist, Kathryn Sloat, to Boston, to play the solo harp music of Britten's, as well as some folksong settings and ""A Birthday Hansel."" - February 5-6, 2016
And Lastly, in April, we are AT LONG LAST planning a performance of two of Britten's most well-loved vocal orchestral works featuring some of Boston's finest musicians playing ""Les Illuminations,"" and ""Serenade for Tenor, Horn, and Strings."" This will be a rare opportunity to hear these pieces done as chamber music in an intimate setting!
As you can see, with the productions slated of:Gian Carlo Menotti's ""Amahl and the Night Visitors"" - December 11-12, 2015


Britten Plays the Harp (Featuring Kate Sloat, Harp) - February 5-6, 2016
Les Illuminations & Serenade for Tenor Horn and Strings - April 8-9, 2016

this is poised to be yet another terrifically ambitious year for Opera Brittenica! 

In the 2013-2014 year, we were incredibly fortunate to have had many patrons support us financially, and many extraordinarily talented artists donate their time and talent, as a contribution and investment in the belief of the mission and direction of OB; all of which is necessary to present works of this scale to the public. 
However, as we value the education and experience of our artists, we are hoping to not rely on the generosity of these performers, and intend to compensate them for their tireless effort in making OB a formidable entity in the Boston music scene. 
We are extremely happy to announce that as of 2014-15, all of our artists who participated in the creation of Opera Brittenica's productions were monetarily compensated for their participation! 
Unfortunately, it doesn't stop here! We need YOU, and other generous souls like you, to help us to prove that Opera isn't dead, and that artists are valuable cultural assets! Producing an opera requires much more funding than you would expect, not to mention providing compensation for the talented artists who dedicate their lives and time to these projects. Here is a small list of fundraising issues that we, and every other company face:


Rights & Rentals: Because Benjamin Britten passed away in the 1970s, his material is not yet in the public domain, unlike that of Puccini or Handel. As such, we must request permission from the publishing company.  This includes rental for orchestral parts and principal scores. Depending on seating and ticket prices, this could range from $1,000-$5,000 per production.


Percussion Rental: As Britten was considerably adventurous in his orchestration for percussion, many of his compositions call for the use of unusual or a vast amount of instruments. Most percussionists do not own their own large equipment, thus requiring the rental of such equipment, often costing upwards of $500-$1,000 depending on the repertoire.

Venue: Fortunately, Opera Brittenica has a reputation for producing edgy and still quality works, in unusual locations, so most concerts are housed churches and museums in the Boston area, however, we will need to donate some percentage of revenue to the church, as well as the rental of any theatre that is used for staged work. 

Production/Marketing: We would love to be able to market to a wider audience, but this costs money as well. The printing of programs, posters, flyers, website hosting, business cards, etc. are expenses that may vary widely from production to production. Looking at the past few years' figures, we have come to expect somewhere in the range of $1,000-$1,500 for the season's publicity in printing and publicity. 

However, while this seems like an impossibility and a huge sum of money that we are asking for, ALL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS CAMPAIGN ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE! As it is, Opera Brittenica is fiscally sponsored under Fractured Atlas, an umbrella organization that accepts donations and distributes them to the projects that are being donated to. Donations of any size are accepted, and only a letter of donation is requested if over $1,000 will be given. In addition, we are currently seeking dedicated members of the avant-garde opera-loving community to join in the creation of the board of directors for Opera Brittenica. If this interests you, please contact Joshua Collier to discuss details.                                         
We do, however, completely understand if you are not in a financial position to support us with a monetary donation, but there are myriad other ways that you can help Opera Brittenica in it's everyday activities! Below are some other ways that you can support us!
*Artist Housing - As we are determined to bring the best performance possible to our community, and as talented as our locals are, occasionally, it is necessary that we have a performer come from out of town. This artist would need a place to stay for the performance rehearsals, and performances, and could transition from being an incredible artist, to a life-long friend! Please contact us if you have a bedroom/bathroom within the Boston Metro area (T accessible) that you would be willing to donate to OB!
*Ushers - We always need ushers to help with the box office, and showing guests to their seats! Not only do you act as an ambassador for OB, but you would receive a free opportunity to see the show!
*Marketing assistance - We are fortunate to have the amount of followers that we have, but alas, we cannot know everyone in Boston (Try as we might!) Any opportunity for you to spread the word to your circle of friends and families is more than welcome.
*Sets, Costumes, Props - While we have designers and artists that create the visual elements of the performed works, occasionally we are in search of a specific couch, or lumber, or decorative art work. If seeing your belongings on stage interests you, please get in touch for when Prop lists and set plots are sent out, and maybe that setee that you have in your basement will be able to have a plaque that stated that ""Famous Performer"" sat here in OB's Production of...
You see, while cold hard cash definitely helps, it's not everything! We welcome any assistance that you can give. If you have any other suggestion, please feel free to call us at any time!                                           
Thank you so much, Boston, for your support of our musical/theatrical/operatic vision. We look forward to continuing to produce the high calibre productions as you have come to know from OB, and thank you in advance for doing all that you can to keep this incredible art alive in our beautiful city! 
Sincerely, 
Joshua Collier, Artistic Director, Opera Brittenica

<b>My Campaign</b> <span><br/></span><span><span>I have been working on this new EP for a while, and I am so excited that we are almost done!!  I have recorded 5 songs for this project, each of them with their own story behind them.  My first Album was all about Journey and finding my way, my second Album was very much about my growth in songwriting and being a little sassy, and this third Album is a little more about Love.  <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Recording Music is a dream come true - being able to share with you all my heart through song is such a blessing, thank you for being so supportive!  Here is a bit of information on the songs we are recording:<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">- Be Brave -<span><br/></span></b><span><span><span>This song was written about depression, bullying, anxiety, anything that makes you feel like you can't make it through the day or that you aren't good enough.  This song is me saying be brave! be courageous! be strong! YOU can do this.  Ironically about 1 year after writing this, Sarah Bareilles came out with her song 'Brave' but I decided I loved this song too much to keep it on a shelf.  <span><br/></span><br/></span><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">- Bad At Goodbye -</b><br/></span><span><span>I wrote this song with one of my good friends, Bill DiLuigi!  We all hate saying goodbye - if it's for a day, a week, a month or forever - That idea turned into a song all about that feeling of longing or missing your other half when they go and how 'hello' is so much easier. <br/></span><br/></span><span><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">- Why Me -</b><span><br/></span><span><span><span><span>This is one of my favourite stripped down songs I do! This song is all about not being able to believe how lucky you are to be with the one you love. Sometimes I find myself asking, Why did you pick me?  :) <br/></span><br/></span><span><b>- Let Me Be -</b><br/></span><span>This song is about wanting to be ""the one"" for someone who maybe hasn't seen you in a romantic way.  At the time I wrote this, I was helping a guy friend get over his relationship and piece his heart back together while silently wishing he would see that I could be the one he was looking for.<br/></span><span></span><br/></span><b>- Go Slow -<span><br/></span></b></span></span></span>This is one of my favourite songs to sing live.  It's about getting lost inside a single moment and not being able to tear yourself away from someone and saying 'goodnight' a million times because you honestly can't stand to see them go.  If they have to go, you'd rather them Go Slow :)</span></span></span></span>

<span>Some of my smaller perks include a thank you email, a signed copy of the new EP, or a few of the following perks combined:  a signed copy of the new EP, a T-Shirt, earrings, signed copies of my previous two albums, a skype or phone call, and more.<span><br/></span></span><br/>
</li> <li>If you have a little more to spend, I have put together awesome packages that include most of the above merchandise, and your name in the liner notes, a few singing lessons via skype, a memory book of behind the scene pictures, lyrics, quotes and more (only 5 ever made), a 30 minute skype chat, hand written lyrics and much more<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
</li>
<li> Write a song with me via skype (3-4 hours) and I will demo it, hand written lyrics on a journal I pick out for you, send you lots of BMA Swag including the new EP signed, your name on the liner notes, and more.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
</li>
<li> My largest perk is I will drive/fly to you, we'll write a song in person and make a demo, then I will cook you dinner and we can chat about whatever you want to know or learn about the music industry or me! After you can invite your friends over for an intimate house concert and I will play a 60-90 minute show for you and tell stories that are behind the songs I've written. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
</li> <li>If I don't make my goal, I will still use the funds towards this project, however I may have to cut out the extra instruments, have to pay the indiegogo fee out of pocket, manufacture less albums and possibly pick up a 2nd job depending on how much money I am short. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>Your contribution is essential to help this project move forward.  Without raising this money, these 5 songs will remain unfinished and never get put out into the world.  A few months ago I came to the realization that without doing crowd fundraising or finding sponsors/backers for my music, I wouldn't be able to record music anymore.  YOU are so appreciated. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
</li>
<li>I am so excited about this project, because I get to have the chance to connect with you and be involved together in creating something amazing.  I am really excited about possibly writing songs together, chatting on skype, flying to see you, and just being able to connect on a larger level than just online!  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>'Be Brave' I plan on using for school visits to inspire kids, and have already been approached by multiple charities to use it as their theme song! (And that was just the iphone version!)  'Go Slow' and 'Why Me' I was told were hit songs by a multi grammy winning hit writer.  By contributing to my project you are not only helping me finish these songs, but also allowing me the opportunity to not be so in debt that I can pitch these songs to people and hope that an established Artist will record it! <span><br/></span></span><br/>
</li> <li>I have successfully recorded and released two albums independently - funded by myself, local investors, a small indiegogo campaign and silent investors.  I am very confident that you will enjoy your perks, the EP, but most of all that you will be proud to have invested in me and my career.     <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
</li> <li>I plan on using any revenue gained from the sales of this EP over the summer and fall to help fund my Christmas Album, set to start recording mid September 2015.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul> <li><span>Some of the challenges I face are; after getting back to Canada Mid-July, I have to finish the artwork, approve the mixes, and pay my music expenses/bills from coming home from Nashville.  </span></li>
<li>
<span>I had to quit my job to be able to come to CMA Fan Fair and be an Artist Exhibitor (meet &amp; greets) so a challenge will be paying for these expenses to finish the EP while trying to raise money to pay my own ""life"" bills.</span><br/>

 If I don't make my goal, I will still use the funds towards this project, however I may have to cut out the extra instruments, have to pay the indiegogo fee out of pocket, manufacture less albums and possibly pick up a 2nd job depending on how much money I am short.     The Impact  Your contribution is essential to help this project move forward.  Without raising this money, these 5 songs will remain unfinished and never get put out into the world.  A few months ago I came to the realization that without doing crowd fundraising or finding sponsors/backers for my music, I wouldn't be able to record music anymore.  YOU are so appreciated. 

I am so excited about this project, because I get to have the chance to connect with you and be involved together in creating something amazing.  I am really excited about possibly writing songs together, chatting on skype, flying to see you, and just being able to connect on a larger level than just online!  


'Be Brave' I plan on using for school visits to inspire kids, and have already been approached by multiple charities to use it as their theme song! (And that was just the iphone version!)  'Go Slow' and 'Why Me' I was told were hit songs by a multi grammy winning hit writer.  By contributing to my project you are not only helping me finish these songs, but also allowing me the opportunity to not be so in debt that I can pitch these songs to people and hope that an established Artist will record it! 
 I have successfully recorded and released two albums independently - funded by myself, local investors, a small indiegogo campaign and silent investors.  I am very confident that you will enjoy your perks, the EP, but most of all that you will be proud to have invested in me and my career.     
 I plan on using any revenue gained from the sales of this EP over the summer and fall to help fund my Christmas Album, set to start recording mid September 2015.    Risks & Challenges  Some of the challenges I face are; after getting back to Canada Mid-July, I have to finish the artwork, approve the mixes, and pay my music expenses/bills from coming home from Nashville.  

I had to quit my job to be able to come to CMA Fan Fair and be an Artist Exhibitor (meet & greets) so a challenge will be paying for these expenses to finish the EP while trying to raise money to pay my own ""life"" bills.
 I am the daughter of an accountant, and I am a planner.  I always find a way to raise money and pay all my bills because I think outside the box

I plan on doing house concerts, selling my earrings, teaching, doing a garage sale, finding more local investors, and possibly getting a job or two.
    Other Ways You Can Help  If you can't help or your pocket book is short - no worries - I understand and am there with you on a monthly basis.  Sharing this campaign and spreading the word is an AMAZING contribution to my project.  I appreciate you. Feel free to share the link, or use the Indiegogo share tools!

<br/><div><i><b>You'd Have Loved These Songs in High School</b></i></div>
<div>Formerly a project called ""12 Songs in 12 Days"" which was exactly what it sounds like, intended to help me detach and not get hung up on overproduction. Those twelve days started May 2014 and the album is now...almost done? A vocal pop throwback to 2007 blog culture and the music I wished I could have made when I was much much very less good at making music. Self indulgent and made with love.</div>
<div>
<p><i><b>Chicago, IN</b></i></p>
<p>My first full rap album. No, really, that's actually...<a href=""https://stabsomething.bandcamp.com/track/dream-diary-feat-easy-girl-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">something I do</a></p>
<p><i><b>Stuckhome Syndrome</b></i></p>
<p>Yes, I know, I've been talking this project up forever. It's three albums, really: </p>
<p>-one is a collection of all of the nonspecific music I made for Homestuck over the years  that never got used. </p>
<p>-one is my ill-fated attempt at a Dave Strider album</p>
<p>-one is a 20-track complete overhaul of the best tracks from my Homestuck discography, redone by me now in 2016. </p>
<p>Overall, it's a way for me to close the book on a huge chapter of my music career and move on with my life, ok,</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Tunes for Moms and Dads and Kids and Teens</i></b></p>
<p>An album of songs for kids. Really! Check out a demo of one of the cuts <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/spellmynamewithabang/i-never-washed-my-hands/s-958dB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Someone Else's Album</i></b></p>
<p>A vocal pop album where the instrumental bed is entirely created by manipulating samples from songs by a good friend of mine. You can hear examples in the video at the top of this page, actually! All the incidental music in it is from this.</p>
<p><b>AND, YOU KNOW, MORE</b></p>
<p>I don't want to bog you down with everything but there is a lot of music in the works and it's gonna get released over the next two and a half years and change or so. You can get most or all of it!</p>
<h3>TEE SHIRT?</h3>Why yes, friend. Actually, several tee shirts. With a fancy little hook:<p></p>

<p>So the <b>$5000 </b>covers the above, right? But what about the miracle crazy scenario that I get <i>more money than that? <b>I have plans.</b></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If I </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>get $7,500 I'll be able to do a CD release. </b>Which is awesome! I'll be the toast of every soccer mom's disc changer. I've got a cool CD package planned, involving an extensive art booklet (way beyond what's planned for the digital release), cool disc art, and secret bonus tracks thanks to messing with the 1980s digital magic of Redbook Audio. </span></p>
<p><b>If I get $15,000 I'll be able to do a vinyl release. </b>Vinyl is a lot more expensive to produce than CD and requires special <i>additional </i>mixing and mastering, plus needs consideration for length due to the nature of how records, you know, <i>work. <b>But anything can happen with the money to do it.</b> </i>This would include a ton of cool stuff, including a fancy gatefold cover, 180 gram vinyl, and MAYBE EVEN multiple editions like a picture disc version or a 180g 4-disc black vinyl audiophile edition for the Purest Sound There Can Be, Ever.</p>
<p><b>If I get MORE THAN $15,000 I'll ??????????????: </b><i>That seems like a <b>lot</b> of money to rake in for such a tiny dude as me. </i>But if it happens, I've got ideas. Lots of ideas. And you'll all be in the know on 'em.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<br/>RISK.</h3>I could die. Then the music wouldn't get made. That's about it; I'm finishing these over the next few years and even if it seems like a lot of music (I mean, it is) a lot of it is already done, so it shouldn't be the huge problem it might sound like. It'll get made anyway; consider this getting funded its guarantee you'll hear it.<p><br/></p>

Yes, I know, I've been talking this project up forever. It's three albums, really: 
-one is a collection of all of the nonspecific music I made for Homestuck over the years  that never got used. 
-one is my ill-fated attempt at a Dave Strider album
-one is a 20-track complete overhaul of the best tracks from my Homestuck discography, redone by me now in 2016. 
Overall, it's a way for me to close the book on a huge chapter of my music career and move on with my life, ok,

Tunes for Moms and Dads and Kids and Teens
An album of songs for kids. Really! Check out a demo of one of the cuts here.

Someone Else's Album
A vocal pop album where the instrumental bed is entirely created by manipulating samples from songs by a good friend of mine. You can hear examples in the video at the top of this page, actually! All the incidental music in it is from this.
AND, YOU KNOW, MORE
I don't want to bog you down with everything but there is a lot of music in the works and it's gonna get released over the next two and a half years and change or so. You can get most or all of it!
TEE SHIRT?Why yes, friend. Actually, several tee shirts. With a fancy little hook:






A new design will be revealed each time the previous one sells 42 units! Check back soon to see the next one.
OTHER??? ??As this Indiegogo campaign develops, more cool junk for you will be revealed. STAY TUNED TO THE UPDATES AND MY TWITTER I GUESS, IF YOU, WANT




So the $5000 covers the above, right? But what about the miracle crazy scenario that I get more money than that? I have plans.
If I get $7,500 I'll be able to do a CD release. Which is awesome! I'll be the toast of every soccer mom's disc changer. I've got a cool CD package planned, involving an extensive art booklet (way beyond what's planned for the digital release), cool disc art, and secret bonus tracks thanks to messing with the 1980s digital magic of Redbook Audio. 
If I get $15,000 I'll be able to do a vinyl release. Vinyl is a lot more expensive to produce than CD and requires special additional mixing and mastering, plus needs consideration for length due to the nature of how records, you know, work. But anything can happen with the money to do it. This would include a ton of cool stuff, including a fancy gatefold cover, 180 gram vinyl, and MAYBE EVEN multiple editions like a picture disc version or a 180g 4-disc black vinyl audiophile edition for the Purest Sound There Can Be, Ever.
If I get MORE THAN $15,000 I'll ??????????????: That seems like a lot of money to rake in for such a tiny dude as me. But if it happens, I've got ideas. Lots of ideas. And you'll all be in the know on 'em.



RISK.I could die. Then the music wouldn't get made. That's about it; I'm finishing these over the next few years and even if it seems like a lot of music (I mean, it is) a lot of it is already done, so it shouldn't be the huge problem it might sound like. It'll get made anyway; consider this getting funded its guarantee you'll hear it.

<b><h3>Why WXRY?</h3>
</b><p>WXRY has been independent public radio in SC's capital city for 
ten years. From day one, we've brought you music that you couldn't hear 
anywhere else. But we've always been more than music. We've been a 
catalyst behind the scenes. We've been the engine that made community 
involvement and discovering one's city cool again. We were the the first to return to SC's Main Street. We were 
the first to revive championing local and regional music and local and 
regional musicians. We've broadcast mayoral and city council debates, 
countless parades and a number of community gatherings. 
</p><h3>Surrounding the City with Non-Profit Radio
</h3><p></p><p>Working with our affiliate groups, the Friends of 
Independent Public Radio, we have received two new FM licenses to boost

<h3>Who</h3> <p></p>
<p>Born and raised in Quito-Ecuador, Carlos Mena is one of the rising stars in the New York City music scene. </p>
<p>Carlos' career highlights includes performances with notable musical artists and shows, to name a few: with <strong>Arturo Sandoval</strong>, <strong>Antonio Hart</strong>, <strong>Don Omar</strong>, <strong>Willie Colón</strong>, <strong>Pedrito Martinez</strong>,  <strong>Michael Mossman</strong>, <strong>Gene Jackson</strong>, <strong>John Ellis</strong>, <strong>Mayito Rivera</strong> (former singer for Los Van Van), <strong>John Davis</strong>, <strong>Andrew Atkinson</strong>, <strong>Cliff Korman</strong>, <strong>Jeb Patton </strong>and <strong>Sergio Sacoto</strong>.</p>
<p>For the past few months, Carlos has been working on his first solo album, which will feature world-class players and encompass a myriad of genres, including jazz, hip hop, Latin rhythms and a string quartet.  </p>
<p>And, through this IndieGogo campaign, YOU can be a part of this one-of-a-kind experience!!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What</h3> <p>We want to make a <b>ground-breaking album</b>, that will allow everyone to enjoy Carlos' music in its various forms, the same way thousands of New Yorkers have been enjoying it for the past ten years, in venues as diverse as Terraza 7 in Queens, to the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem.</p>
<p>The funds raised with this campaign will help cover some of the costs associated with making such an album, including (but not limited to):</p> <ul> <li>
<b>Studio time:</b> professional studios are expensive for a reason... they sound amazing!!!  <br/>And we need to be in there for a while: when you're shooting for that performance that'll move you every time you listen to it, it takes about 4-5 hours to record a single track, and at least the same amount of time to mix it.</li> <li>

Who 
Born and raised in Quito-Ecuador, Carlos Mena is one of the rising stars in the New York City music scene. 
Carlos' career highlights includes performances with notable musical artists and shows, to name a few: with Arturo Sandoval, Antonio Hart, Don Omar, Willie Colón, Pedrito Martinez,  Michael Mossman, Gene Jackson, John Ellis, Mayito Rivera (former singer for Los Van Van), John Davis, Andrew Atkinson, Cliff Korman, Jeb Patton and Sergio Sacoto.
For the past few months, Carlos has been working on his first solo album, which will feature world-class players and encompass a myriad of genres, including jazz, hip hop, Latin rhythms and a string quartet.  
And, through this IndieGogo campaign, YOU can be a part of this one-of-a-kind experience!!   What We want to make a ground-breaking album, that will allow everyone to enjoy Carlos' music in its various forms, the same way thousands of New Yorkers have been enjoying it for the past ten years, in venues as diverse as Terraza 7 in Queens, to the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem.
The funds raised with this campaign will help cover some of the costs associated with making such an album, including (but not limited to):  
Studio time: professional studios are expensive for a reason... they sound amazing!!!  And we need to be in there for a while: when you're shooting for that performance that'll move you every time you listen to it, it takes about 4-5 hours to record a single track, and at least the same amount of time to mix it. 
Production team: because all that gear refuses to operate by itself!  Plus, they've been working with Carlos for months before recording, helping him define anything from repertoire, design, sonic criteria, and this very campaign.  
The most amazing musicians in the world: because you're worth it!  And so is the music... This album will feature an all-star lineup of the best musicians in New York City.  Some of them, you've already seen in the videos we've released so far: ""Cissy Strut"" features Brian Charette (Downbeat Magazine's Critics Poll Rising Star 2014) and Antonio Sanchez ( who's played with... everyone, including Pat Metheny, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, John Scofield... oh, and he also conceived and performed the original music for Birdman).""Trip to Wendy's"" featured Leo Genovese (Esperanza Spalding, Joe Lovano, Jack DeJohnette) and Jojo Mayer (Screaming Headless Torsos, Dizzie Gillespie, John Zorn, Steve Coleman).






The object previously known as record: in this case, we'll release the material in three different formats.  CDs, for those for you who still love the experience of tearing off the plastic wrapping, smelling the ink off the booklet, and putting that shinny thing on your finger before it reaches the machine that will actually play it.  USB Cards, because we're really hip, and so are you.  These will feature the music in both mp3 and hi-res audio, PDF versions of the booklet and other graphic material, pictures, both videos mentioned above, and behind-the-scenes footage.  And you can transfer those files to your computer and keep using the card as a portable flash drive!  And of course, the album will also be available through most online retailers such as Amazon and iTunes.

</h3><div>
<p>Last year Tunnel Vision did a did a mini East Coast tour sidelining with surfboard 
shaper Matt Biolos, and Mike Reola of the Lost crew.  The boys are currently doing  this Indie GoGo Campaign to raise funds for their Self-Titled  Album Debut &amp; Summer Tour. The band already has a long list of dates and venues booked see below.<br/></p> <p></p>
<p>Tunnel Vision is quickly becoming Southern California’s  favorite new
 Surf, Reggae, Ska band. The band is comprised of five San Clemente 
musicians who grew up with instruments in their hands and skateboards 
and surfboards under their feet. Tunnel Vision originally formed as a 
three-piece band, with Hayden Hanson as the lead singer and guitarist, 
Jacob Hernandez on bass, and Tanner Payan on drums and additional 
vocals. The three have been long time friends, who grew up in South San 
Clemente’s Trestles neighborhood surfing waves and riding concrete 
bowls.</p>
<p>Growing up in SoCal, the band was heavily influenced by the Punk 
Rock, Reggae and Ska Music of  bands like Sublime, Slightly Stoopid, 
NoFX, Rancid and Mad Caddies. The boys have all worked in the surf 
industry for years, starting out in retail for Rip Curl and moving on to
 manufacturing surfboards for Lost Enterprises.</p>
<p>Tunnel Vision recently increased the band from a three-piece to a 
five-piece by adding Doug Alani and Matt Risley. Matt Risely  &amp; Doug
 both met the guys through their connections with Lost’s retail store 
Catalyst. Matt comes down from his mountain cabin with his wolf in tow 
and plays keyboards with the band.  While Doug brings saxophone to the 
sound of Tunnel Vision.</p>The boys recently connected with Miles, Kyle 
&amp; Dela of Slightly Stoopid.  Slightly Stoopid took the boys under 
their wing and let them record the rest of their album at the Slightly 
Stoopid Studios in San Diego. The boys were also picked up by Whiskey Barrel Records through the help of their Manager Anthony Levato. The Self titled album is rolling 
out in July 2015.<br/><br/><p>You can hear some of Tunnel Vision’s music now on the website under 
The Music Tab.  Make sure to sign up for their email list and follow 
them on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. All the summer show dates are listed on 
the home page. <br/></p>

vocals. The three have been long time friends, who grew up in South San 
Clemente’s Trestles neighborhood surfing waves and riding concrete 
bowls.
Growing up in SoCal, the band was heavily influenced by the Punk 
Rock, Reggae and Ska Music of  bands like Sublime, Slightly Stoopid, 
NoFX, Rancid and Mad Caddies. The boys have all worked in the surf 
industry for years, starting out in retail for Rip Curl and moving on to
 manufacturing surfboards for Lost Enterprises.
Tunnel Vision recently increased the band from a three-piece to a 
five-piece by adding Doug Alani and Matt Risley. Matt Risely  & Doug
 both met the guys through their connections with Lost’s retail store 
Catalyst. Matt comes down from his mountain cabin with his wolf in tow 
and plays keyboards with the band.  While Doug brings saxophone to the 
sound of Tunnel Vision.The boys recently connected with Miles, Kyle 
& Dela of Slightly Stoopid.  Slightly Stoopid took the boys under 
their wing and let them record the rest of their album at the Slightly 
Stoopid Studios in San Diego. The boys were also picked up by Whiskey Barrel Records through the help of their Manager Anthony Levato. The Self titled album is rolling 
out in July 2015.You can hear some of Tunnel Vision’s music now on the website under 
The Music Tab.  Make sure to sign up for their email list and follow 
them on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. All the summer show dates are listed on 
the home page.

The Impact
  Tunnel Vision is excited to get out on the road and bring their music and energy to a venue near you.  
TunnelVision is debuting their new album and want to share their sound with  all their fans across the country.  
The
 boys did a mini east tour last year and are anxious to get back out 
there and see everyone. And surf some east coast waves too.

Risks & Challenges  We are young surfers and musicians living is Southern California making low wages surviving in the daily grind.

Were hoping to get our music out there and spread the Tunnel Vision Love. 
We already have a ton of shows booked as you can see above and we are hoping to add more where we can.

I’ve been writing songs for about 14 years now. I bought my first guitar and started writing songs, and since then, I’ve really grown as an artist. I picked up keyboard a few years ago, and now write multiple parts and harmonies for songs, and play with a full backing band.</p><p>I’ve been involved in the Bay Area music scene here in Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco for five years. In 2016, I released my debut <i>The Good and Bad ep</i>, produced by Tommy P. of Harlow’s Monkey’s, who is the same producer of my album, at<strong> <a href=""https://www.11thaverecords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">11th Avenue Studios</a></strong> in San Francisco. He’s a good friend of mine, super talented, and I’m very happy to be working with him again. We have lain down rough tracks for 11 songs for what’s going to be my first full length album. The record is set to be released in June. </p><p>I have all kinds of influences from the 50’s to the present such as Buddy Holly, Weezer, Rilo Kiley, Blondie (thanks, Mom!), and Ingrid Michaelson. I’m a big 80s fan, big 90s alternative and r&amp;b fan, and I think all of it’s in there, and that Tommy and I did a good job of bringing all these influences together, and that all the songs are very different.</p><p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p><p>The main costs to finish the album are going to be mixing, mastering, and design, manufacturing, and distribution. Vinyl is expensive, but I love records, so I really wanted to make my record available on vinyl for people who want to have it. The more pre-orders I sell, the more I can spend on mixing and mastering the album, which is important. The more contributions I get will also make a difference surrounding how many initial CDs and records I can order. </p><p>If you can’t donate, the best thing to do to help is to just <strong>share this</strong>. Tell people about me and my album and what I’m trying to do, and share the link to this campaign.</p><p><strong>What’s In It For You?</strong></p><p>Lots of perks! I will be doing everything from releasing the title track,  “The Big Squeeze,” as a digital single in advance of the album release, stickers, records, CDs, and mp3s. I really love to do lettering and doodling, so I will do a hand-drawn lyric book just for you as one of the rewards. Another reward is I will cover a song of your choosing on video. I am also offering a reward of your choice of an original short story or poem, since writing is another passion of mine, and long before I wrote music I was always a writer. I will also be writing thank-you cards, and you will have a chance to receive a shout out at my record release show on Facebook Live, as well as be mentioned for your contribution in the liner notes.</p><p><strong>Where Else Would the Funding Go?</strong></p><p>In addition to the design, mixing, mastering, and manufacturing of the album, another thing the funding can make possible is a tour. I’m from <strong>Houston</strong>, and last year I organized a concert series to help people I knew, and some people I didn’t know, who were severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey. We raised more than $5,000 for ten families. (You can learn more about that <strong><a href=""http://harvey.littlespiral.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong>.) I will be doing a show in Houston in July, and would love to do a Texas tour with stops in Austin, Dallas, and San Antonio while I am there! I would also like to tour the Bay Area, the West Coast, and the Northeast, anywhere from D.C. to New York! <strong>You can help make it happen!</strong></p><p><strong>Risks</strong></p><p>There are no risks involved regarding your contribution to this project. I have set a flexible goal, because I'm going to release this record no matter what. That said, your pre-release contribution is going to help me tremendously. It will make a difference in everything from the final product in terms of the quality of the mixing and mastering to how much I can pay the design and layout people to how many CDs and vinyl records I can pay to be manufactured up front; and whether I can have t-shirts made and how many of those I can order up front; and whether I can afford to play a few shows in the Bay Area and pay people to back me; to whether I can do a Texas tour this summer and play for my friends and family in Houston, Austin, and Dallas-Ft. Worth, and San Antonio. If you would like to see me succeed, and if you would like to have a copy of my record, the best time to support me is now.</p><p><strong>My Intention</strong></p><p>I want to emphasize that I love what music can do for people’s lives. My intention is to help people.

<p>After years of touring the UK, and life occasionally getting in the way, we have FINALLY finished work on our debut album. It is the culmination of years of work and we couldn’t be prouder of the result. We can’t wait for you all to hear this thing.</p>

<p>Please don’t judge us too harshly for it. It’ll all be worth it in the end (we promise).</p>
<p><i><strong>A CURSE FROM YEARS GONE BY</strong></i></p>

<ol>
<li>Fund a run of 12” vinyl with lovely packaging - £1,200 (the more we raise the more we can press!)</li>
<li>Fund a small marketing campaign for the record - £800</li>
</ol>
<p>Any extra money we raise will go towards expanding the marketing campaign, doing a longer run of vinyl or producing more cool stuff for all of you.</p>
<p>We don’t want something for nothing. In return for your support we are offering a special discount to pre-orders of the vinyl and merch bundles, as well as unique items and experiences.</p>
<p>If you pledge anything at all, we will love you forever.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After getting together to hang out and jam, the members of All My Sons quickly decided to put together a band that marries elements of blues, rock, and your dad's old collection of 1970's records.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Turns out, recording an album in New York can be expensive. Luckily for us, we've been able to raise some funds through boking live shows. Unluckily for us, we still have some more to raise. The main components of the campaigns are as follows:</p>

<li>Fundraising goal of $2,500.</li>
<li>Exclusive perks from All My Sons with each campaign contribution, including album pre-sale, exclusive merch, and access to the studio. </li>
<li>Updates from the band concerning the recording and making of our debut album. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We aim to record this album towards the end of October, however, due to the ever-changing nature of New York real estate, this could potentially be pushed back by a few weeks. We, as a band, promise to be transparent about our progress, and are so excited to get this album out to you all. </p>

Musicians, researchers, music schools, universities, museums, collectors and fans of ancient Greek civilization, can now enjoy the sound of this magical instrument resurrected from classical antiquity.</p><p style=""text-align:justify;"">The lyre as reconstructed by Mr. Georgiou, is a perfect replica of an eight-string lyre of the 5th century B.C. <strong>Respecting </strong>the international regulations for the protection of various species, Mr. Georgiou does not use animal parts in the process of the reconstruction of ancient Greek lyre. The turtle shells used for these instruments are exact copies of an original turtle shell, made of  specific chemical mixtures of resins, providing the same quality of sound, resonance and color as the original turtle shell. The string holder is made from the same chemical mixture. The other parts of the instrument are made of solid wood. The strings are of PVC plastic. These strings are more durable than the gut strings used by ancient Greeks and provide the same quality of sound as gut strings. The instrument has also a leather strap for holding purposes and a plectrum made of hard wood.</p><p style=""text-align:justify;"">The ancient Greek lyre can be characterized as a “friendly musical instrument” for any one. It doesn’t need to know about music or playing musical instruments. Just plug the strings of the lyre for a few minutes and feel calm. The unique sound of this instrument enriched with many harmonic resonances will guide your soul to meditation. The ancient Greek physician Asclepius healed his patients with the sounds of the lyre.</p><p style=""text-align:justify;"">The reconstruction and availability of ancient Greek lyre to the public, is an attempt concerning the vision of the revival of ancient Greek music and musical instruments from the classical antiquity. The existence of ancient Greek lyre, an educational instrument for the youngsters in ancient Greece, aims to enrich the knowledge of ancient Greek musical educational system and bring awareness to musical educational programs  in our times as well.</p><p style=""text-align:justify;"">Orpheus, son of Apollo, plays his lyre, as shown on a vase painting of the Greek Classical antiquity.</p><p style=""text-align:justify;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488824361/iary2h1ai8x40z5po5ep.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The major stories about Orpheus are centered on his ability to charm all living beings and even stones with his music.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>A “friendly musical instrument” for any one</strong></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488819768/j05p4glhwulzpluyomhz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>A “friendly musical instrument”.

Musicians, researchers, music schools, universities, museums, collectors and fans of ancient Greek civilization, can now enjoy the sound of this magical instrument resurrected from classical antiquity.The lyre as reconstructed by Mr. Georgiou, is a perfect replica of an eight-string lyre of the 5th century B.C. Respecting the international regulations for the protection of various species, Mr. Georgiou does not use animal parts in the process of the reconstruction of ancient Greek lyre. The turtle shells used for these instruments are exact copies of an original turtle shell, made of  specific chemical mixtures of resins, providing the same quality of sound, resonance and color as the original turtle shell. The string holder is made from the same chemical mixture. The other parts of the instrument are made of solid wood. The strings are of PVC plastic. These strings are more durable than the gut strings used by ancient Greeks and provide the same quality of sound as gut strings. The instrument has also a leather strap for holding purposes and a plectrum made of hard wood.The ancient Greek lyre can be characterized as a “friendly musical instrument” for any one. It doesn’t need to know about music or playing musical instruments. Just plug the strings of the lyre for a few minutes and feel calm. The unique sound of this instrument enriched with many harmonic resonances will guide your soul to meditation. The ancient Greek physician Asclepius healed his patients with the sounds of the lyre.The reconstruction and availability of ancient Greek lyre to the public, is an attempt concerning the vision of the revival of ancient Greek music and musical instruments from the classical antiquity. The existence of ancient Greek lyre, an educational instrument for the youngsters in ancient Greece, aims to enrich the knowledge of ancient Greek musical educational system and bring awareness to musical educational programs  in our times as well.Orpheus, son of Apollo, plays his lyre, as shown on a vase painting of the Greek Classical antiquity.The major stories about Orpheus are centered on his ability to charm all living beings and even stones with his music. A “friendly musical instrument” for any oneA “friendly musical instrument”. It's sound can guide your soul to meditation. Ancient Greek music can sound againThe ancient Greek Lyre is alive again after 2500 years. All fans of ancient Greek civilization can now enjoy its magical sound and travel in the golden time of harmony.  ""Hey Jude"" by The Beatles accompanied by the ancient Greek lyreA valuable musical instrument for museums, composers, musicians (especially for those who interested for experimental musical instruments), sound production studios and film makers. Details and photos about perksIMPORTANT! Your donations can be provided from PayPal accounts in any currency.

<p>Hi. My name is Marc Mullins and I've been writing and
performing Christian music since the late 1970s when I first entered the
pastoral ministry. For the past 36 years people have been asking when I was
going to record an album of my original music. You've heard the saying,
""Better late than never."" Well... that saying has finally come true
for me as I begin my first professional recording project.</p>
I've hired the services of Upshot Studios to record,
mix and master a full-length music CD that will feature 10-13 of my most
favored and requested songs. This project is a fully professional endeavor and
the result will be a music album that will bless and uplift people in their own
life journeys. There's not a specific release date yet, but I'm aiming to get
the record out in the Spring of 2016. The album will be available in a standard
CD edition as well as a digital version.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Although I've already committed some of my own financial
resources to this project, I'm seeking an additional $10,000 to cover other
costs associated with recording, mixing and mastering this music CD. This
amount will also help pay for the studio musicians who will join me in the
making of this album and for the cost of the perks and postage.</p>
<p>In order to help me raise the necessary funds to complete
this recording project I've decided to invite people like you to join me in
this venture. There are several benefits and distinct advantages for you when
you partner with me in this campaign. Your early support will grant you access to exclusive items and experiences not available anywhere else.</p>
<p>First, contributors will receive perks that are only
available through this Indiegogo campaign. Your partnership in this project is
especially important to me and I want to provide you with some tangible
expression of my gratitude. Therefore, you will find a variety of perk awards
on this page that you can receive depending on the level of your support
contribution.</p>
<p>Additionally, since many of the awards include a digital
copy of the album, you can get a digital copy sent to you in advance of the
date that the music CD is available for distribution. This means that you will
be among the first to actually receive and hear the music in its professionally
mastered form.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by coming back to this site you will see
behind-the-scenes footage of this project from beginning to end in the studio
and more. Using high definition video equipment, I will take you with me to
experience the fascinating process of making a music album from start to
finish. It will be as though you're right there with the band and me in the
studio. And I assure you that this is one journey you'll appreciate for a long
time to come.</p>
<p>Finally, you'll get to experience with me the making of my
first-ever music video. One of the songs on the album will be selected and
featured in a full-length music video that is sure to bless you and others. And just
think, it will be as though you're right there with me when you watch video
clips that show the making of this music video in action. I'm more than excited
to take you along with me on this journey!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>My friend, Jacque Talboy, said it best when interviewed by UpShot Studio for the making of this music album. She said, ""I would love to have copies of Marc's songs to pop into my car, or share with my friends or my family, or a loved one who just needs a lift.""</p>
<p>I assure you... Jacque knows what she's talking about. Her husband, Rob, was a professional studio musician in Los Angeles for many years and a member of my praise and worship band more recently. And Jacque served as our praise band's sound technician. Her ear for good music is quite remarkable. So when she says my music is good, you can trust her word for it.

 My first tour to promote my first album, Living On Land. My name is Jacob Engle and I make music. Hip-Hop music to be more specific. From an early age I became a student of the culture, beginning with the Def Jux/ Rhymesayers era and learning in reverse from there. As nontraditional as it may seem, it feels like it is about that time to create a journey of our own and would love nothing more than for us to be on this ride together.
  The Breakdown.
 No one has done this alone, and unfortunately love can't pay the bills but...  After traveling consistently for so long we do hope that love of art will translate to (just enough) money for pockets, in turn continuing toward the collective goal of making music and hitting the road with it.

<h1>Timeless Texts.<span><br/></span>
</h1>
<h1>New Melodies. </h1>
<h1>Colorful Orchestrations.</h1>
<p>We are embarking on a journey to create something that has never been done quite like this. Through the combined efforts of over 150 musicians, we are bringing texts to life that proclaim the Gospel through a musical palate that transcends genres. Every note and rest is carefully arranged to dramatically magnify the text. We believe that the church is at a strategic musical crossroads in which the divides between genre, demographic, and preference continue to grow, and if not addressed will cause the rift to remain, or styles to simply be phased out in their entirety. We believe that this album, by God's grace, is the first of our offerings towards bridging the gap. </p>
<p>We believe that the most compelling music in the world should be coming from within the Church. Bach and his Christian contemporaries achieved this, not only through aesthetic appeal or commercial acclaim, but through excellence in craft and execution that continues to transcend boundaries of intellect, age, or style. We hold fast to this heritage and aim for such excellence.</p>
<p>The recording serves as the keystone to Slowly in Type's other resources (including scores and parts) for utilization in the church. The album is a potent resource for music departments and congregations alike. We also plan to make “stems” (isolated tracks) for each song available to supplement any church's ensemble (of varying sizes and ability) to help realize the songs in their fullest context. </p>
<h1>The Budget.</h1>
<p>48% - 60 piece orchestra, 80 voice choir, 6 piece rhythm section <br/>38% - Recording Studios, Engineers, Mixing, Mastering, Orchestration, Music Preparation, Producer <br/>9% - Crowdfunding Fees <br/>5% - Copyrights, Duplication, Shipping</p>
<p>Making an album is costly when Choir, Orchestra, and Band are involved. We’ve optimized the budget without compromising on the essential elements.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are The Opskamatrists, a Ska-Reggae-Punk band from Idaho Falls, ID. We have been at this SKA thing for 20 years now and want to celebrate 20 years of skanking with you. Over the last 20 years we have had over 20 different musicians join and play in the band and they are one of the reasons why we have been able to keep this thing alive and kicking for so long. The other big reason is you - the fans!</p>
<p>This is why we need your help! We are putting on a show to celebrate the last 20 years of The Opskamatrists and the people who have contributed to the music. Most of those musicians who have been in the band have moved on in life to start careers and families in different parts of the USA.

We are The Opskamatrists, a Ska-Reggae-Punk band from Idaho Falls, ID. We have been at this SKA thing for 20 years now and want to celebrate 20 years of skanking with you. Over the last 20 years we have had over 20 different musicians join and play in the band and they are one of the reasons why we have been able to keep this thing alive and kicking for so long. The other big reason is you - the fans!
This is why we need your help! We are putting on a show to celebrate the last 20 years of The Opskamatrists and the people who have contributed to the music. Most of those musicians who have been in the band have moved on in life to start careers and families in different parts of the USA.

<h3>Join the Ride from Maine to Macon</h3>
<p>Let’s say a big thank you to this incredible band for all the good vibes they’ve given us over the years by working together- through the strength of many, to get the Eat a Peach Tribute Guitar to the Allman Brothers' Big House Museum in Macon Georgia. With ABB manager Bert Holman and Museum director Richard Brent, we’re seizing the moment to make this crowdfunding campaign a success.</p>
<p>Here's what Big House Museum director Richard Brent says- "" <strong>I have played this guitar and I am here to tell you that it plays and sounds every bit as good as it looks! We would be honored to have this at The Big House Museum for fans from all over to play and enjoy.</strong>""</p>
<p>All levels of support are gladly welcomed and genuinely appreciated. Donation perks include market totes, museum memberships, special edition t-shirts, artwork, and a special one-of-a-kind tattoo. Donors at every level will have their name on a plaque to be displayed with the guitar at The Big House Museum.</p>
<p>I made the Eat a Peach tribute guitar from start to finish using skills learned when I worked for a small guitar company in Connecticut in the early 1980's.  The body features my marquetry rendition of the Allman Brothers' epic Eat a Peach album's inside cover design originally created by Flournoy Holmes and David Powell of Wonder Graphics.</p>
<p>The design is hand cut using wood veneers from many tree species. Once the cut veneers are glued onto the guitar and sanded smooth, I create lines and shading with a knife-tipped woodburning pen. On the Eat a Peach design, I tried my best to faithfully re-create all the marks of the original artwork. </p>
<p>The most frequently asked question I get about the Eat a Peach guitar is ""How long did it take you to make?"" One answer is 59 years- my whole life. My folks had a shop in the basement and tools in the garage. A popular family question was always ""What are you making?"" I still use techniques that my dad taught me when I was very young.</p>
<p>Alongside this was the everpresent music in our house. Great music from Dylan and the Beatles on the turntable, my older brother's rock band practicing in the basement shaking the rafters. My early years as a guitar player included listening and learning the Allman Brothers albums. Highlights from my woodworking career include making two guitar designs for the Gibson Custom Shop's then running Visual Artist Program and creating marquetry for Hinckley Yachts.</p>
<p>How long to make the Eat a Peach guitar? Over 100 hours went into the marquetry design- from creating the working patterns to that final sanding before the finish goes on. I make my guitars in batches of three. Starting with planks of mahogany all the way to the point of plugging them in is a period of several months. I'm meticulous and want every inch of all my guitars to be just perfect.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The win/win/win </h3>
<p>When the crowdfund is over and the dust has settled, the Allman Brothers' Big House Museum will be the owner of the Eat a Peach tribute guitar. They will use the instrument to display and to play, and this was important to me. From the time I first plugged this guitar in it was clear that it was not a wall hanger, and that it belonged down South in Allman Brother country. The very act of promoting this campaign is also a way to get the word out about the Museum and it is my hope that those of you who contribute will also enjoy a visit there. It's an incredible place!</p>
<p>This campaign's purpose is to have funders provide the purchase price of the guitar and cover expenses for a trip for two to Macon Georgia so that I can present this guitar to the museum in a meaningful way. A bigger manufacturer of guitars can afford to give a guitar away, but that is not the case for my one-man shop. A finished guitar must be sold to provide capital to fund the next builds.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I've donated to several crowdfunding campaigns before and have found it to be fun. I liked chipping in early and keeping track of the campaign to see how it unfolds and ultimately to see if it succeeds. I've also enjoyed getting the perks offered.</p>
<p>In my campaign, I am really thankful that some very talented people have created or will create special artwork specific to the guitar and the greater subject of music. I'm especially grateful to Peter ""Psychodelik Pete"" Nogas, Michael Pierce, and Kevin Stiles for their creative efforts. I'm really excited to offer these perks and will introduce more cool offers as the campaign progresses.</p>

He has put these two loves together and made a one-of-a-kind instrument that he would like to see go to Macon, Georgia, the home of the Allman Brothers. <br/>Today I put on my Best of the Allman Brothers album, cranked up the volume, and when I got home I made a pledge to the crowd-sourcing effort. <br/>Perhaps you'll think about joining me?""</p>

<p>""The Allman Brothers were a huge influence on my generation here in the UK. Their music and musical ability were renowned and part of that great American tradition . Their reputation and exposure was even more enhanced by their relationship with Clapton. Fabulous musicians and great tunes.""</p>

<p>""James, I just wanted to tell you how much I am impressed with your work/art/woodworking/luthier skills. I keep checking out your creations, but the Eat a Peach tribute was my introduction to your art. I was, and still am, without sufficient words. This particular guitar holds a special place. Our brother Twiggs was the original tour manager for the ABB. As Butch Trucks said he was the first member of the ABB since he is the one sent to Muscle Shoals to get Duane out of his contract with Rick Hall. He and Duane became each other's biggest fans. After Duane's passing Gregg gave Twiggs Duane's tobacco for that very reason. Twiggs kept the guitar and planned on giving it to Duane's daughter Galadrielle when she got old enough to be responsible for it. Unfortunately, Twiggs died in 1979. We three remaining brothers became stewards of the Burst until I, as per Twiggs' wish, handed it off to Galadrielle's mother at Duane's gravesite. Up until that time the Lyndon brothers had made sure it got played. Twiggs was the only guitarist in our family and not exactly the best at it. He and I had both worked for the Dixie Dregs so we allowed Steve Morse to play it on the road and in the studio. As with Duane, Steve and Twiggs became huge fans of each other. In 1996 I began working (my first time as one) as his guitar tech with Deep Purple and stayed with him for 9 years until I had had my fill of touring. Every time the photo of your Eat a Peach tribute guitar shows up I am reminded of time spent with Twiggs, Duane, and Steve. Thank you for such a lovely tribute to one of the best bands ever, in my opinion. Keep up your amazing playable art. You touch more people than you know James.""</p>

Let’s say a big thank you to this incredible band for all the good vibes they’ve given us over the years by working together- through the strength of many, to get the Eat a Peach Tribute Guitar to the Allman Brothers' Big House Museum in Macon Georgia. With ABB manager Bert Holman and Museum director Richard Brent, we’re seizing the moment to make this crowdfunding campaign a success.
Here's what Big House Museum director Richard Brent says- "" I have played this guitar and I am here to tell you that it plays and sounds every bit as good as it looks! We would be honored to have this at The Big House Museum for fans from all over to play and enjoy.""
All levels of support are gladly welcomed and genuinely appreciated. Donation perks include market totes, museum memberships, special edition t-shirts, artwork, and a special one-of-a-kind tattoo. Donors at every level will have their name on a plaque to be displayed with the guitar at The Big House Museum.
I made the Eat a Peach tribute guitar from start to finish using skills learned when I worked for a small guitar company in Connecticut in the early 1980's.  The body features my marquetry rendition of the Allman Brothers' epic Eat a Peach album's inside cover design originally created by Flournoy Holmes and David Powell of Wonder Graphics.
The design is hand cut using wood veneers from many tree species. Once the cut veneers are glued onto the guitar and sanded smooth, I create lines and shading with a knife-tipped woodburning pen. On the Eat a Peach design, I tried my best to faithfully re-create all the marks of the original artwork. 
The most frequently asked question I get about the Eat a Peach guitar is ""How long did it take you to make?"" One answer is 59 years- my whole life. My folks had a shop in the basement and tools in the garage. A popular family question was always ""What are you making?"" I still use techniques that my dad taught me when I was very young.
Alongside this was the everpresent music in our house. Great music from Dylan and the Beatles on the turntable, my older brother's rock band practicing in the basement shaking the rafters. My early years as a guitar player included listening and learning the Allman Brothers albums. Highlights from my woodworking career include making two guitar designs for the Gibson Custom Shop's then running Visual Artist Program and creating marquetry for Hinckley Yachts.
How long to make the Eat a Peach guitar? Over 100 hours went into the marquetry design- from creating the working patterns to that final sanding before the finish goes on. I make my guitars in batches of three. Starting with planks of mahogany all the way to the point of plugging them in is a period of several months. I'm meticulous and want every inch of all my guitars to be just perfect.

The win/win/win 
When the crowdfund is over and the dust has settled, the Allman Brothers' Big House Museum will be the owner of the Eat a Peach tribute guitar. They will use the instrument to display and to play, and this was important to me. From the time I first plugged this guitar in it was clear that it was not a wall hanger, and that it belonged down South in Allman Brother country. The very act of promoting this campaign is also a way to get the word out about the Museum and it is my hope that those of you who contribute will also enjoy a visit there. It's an incredible place!
This campaign's purpose is to have funders provide the purchase price of the guitar and cover expenses for a trip for two to Macon Georgia so that I can present this guitar to the museum in a meaningful way. A bigger manufacturer of guitars can afford to give a guitar away, but that is not the case for my one-man shop. A finished guitar must be sold to provide capital to fund the next builds.
Speaking for myself, I've donated to several crowdfunding campaigns before and have found it to be fun. I liked chipping in early and keeping track of the campaign to see how it unfolds and ultimately to see if it succeeds. I've also enjoyed getting the perks offered.
In my campaign, I am really thankful that some very talented people have created or will create special artwork specific to the guitar and the greater subject of music. I'm especially grateful to Peter ""Psychodelik Pete"" Nogas, Michael Pierce, and Kevin Stiles for their creative efforts. I'm really excited to offer these perks and will introduce more cool offers as the campaign progresses.

Words of Support 
Richard Brent, Director of the Allman Brothers' Big House Museum-
 "" I have played this guitar and I am here to tell you that it plays and sounds every bit as good as it looks! We would be honored to have this at The Big House Museum for fans from all over to play and enjoy.""
 
 Silas Kopf, this country's leading marquetry artist and author of ""A Marquetry Odyssey:     Historical Objects and Personal Work""-
""Do you like the Allman Brothers? Do you like marquetry? My friend Jim Macdonald likes both. He makes guitars and he plays guitars. And is a marquetry master. He has put these two loves together and made a one-of-a-kind instrument that he would like to see go to Macon, Georgia, the home of the Allman Brothers. Today I put on my Best of the Allman Brothers album, cranked up the volume, and when I got home I made a pledge to the crowd-sourcing effort. Perhaps you'll think about joining me?""
 
Sandy Blue Sky-
"" I support this fundraiser to get the Eat a Peach tribute guitar to the Allman Brothers Museum. The Big House is where the ABB rehearsed ""Blue Sky"" and it was there during the rehearsals that I spoke with Duane in the kitchen for the last time. Thank you Jim Macdonald for all the years and patience for creating this beautiful guitar and tribute to the ABB and EAT A PEACH!!!""
 
Michael Pierce, Artist and creator of the very cool Maine to Macon Poster offered here-
""All you Macon music Allman Brothers and Sisters get on the bus and help bring this beautiful handmade Eat a Peach guitar to The Allman Brothers Band Museum at The Big House.""
 
A friend and client's thoughts-
""The Allman Brothers were a huge influence on my generation here in the UK. Their music and musical ability were renowned and part of that great American tradition . Their reputation and exposure was even more enhanced by their relationship with Clapton. Fabulous musicians and great tunes.""
 
Peter ""Psychodelik Pete"" Nogas, Artist and creator of the great guitar on truck T-shirt design
Meeting Brother Jim and his beautiful creation ""Eat A Peach Tribute Guitar"" was a special treat this February!
I have seen posts of this guitar a few years back and admired the skilled craftsmanship.
 I don't play guitar, but I appreciate those who do! To see a guitar transformed into a beautiful canvas that also plays beautifully is a real treat!
As an artist, I can tell you that this is a beautiful tribute piece to the legacy of the Allman Brothers Band and the ""Eat A Peach Album"" Album rock art at it's best!
A must see up close and in person. Jim Macdonald has created a beautiful monster.
Glad to have been able to hold, help raise awareness of, and help to find its way home in
Macon Georgia.

<p>“Threads of genius are present in everyone but only become visible when something creative is attempted…” William Blake</p>
<p><i>Family, Friends, Supporters:</i></p>
<p>I’m thrilled to share with you that I’m about to release not only 1 but 2 new albums in completely different genres of music Classical Guitar and Cinematic/Ambient. The release of these albums has been a deep journey of personal transformation for me, and my goal is to share not only my music with more of the world, but to help educate and inspire the next generation through hands-on experience of music creation.</p>
<p>While recording this Winter, I saw the movie Liyana about kids in Africa telling stories to heal and this threaded me into a desire to volunteer and facilitate music education in countries I’ve planned to travel to this year - Colombia, South Africa, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>But this also reawakened my desire to speak to kids in high schools and young adults in colleges with Keynote Concerts to inspire and help evoke their own creative genius.</p>
<p>As a coach and mentor, I realize the earlier we can tap into that spark of creative magic, the healthier and more empowered we become.</p>
<p>I remember when that little voice got louder and louder at the age of 16 that if I didn’t start learning to play guitar then, I might never learn. And I had only 2 years of very basic music education in Catholic grade school. Without supporting music and art education in early school, we neglect the imagination that seeks to erupt from the next generation, ready to share their gifts to help us all evolve together.</p>
<p>In 2017, while traveling through Europe, I experienced two powerful losses, my journal and my guitar, within two days that profoundly reoriented me towards my creative pursuits. </p>
<p>After some time in deep contemplation in the mountains following this, I realized that a huge chunk of my soul had not been realized. I was hiking and listening to all of these songs I had channeled on guitar and wondering how these songs—which felt like abandoned children—could sound if properly recorded. Instead of trying to record myself, synchronicity helped me find a great engineer in Denver who has helped expand and enhance these songs with layers of percussion, bass, leads, and wonderful studio production.</p>
<p>The release for this album is planned for mid-May as part of my 40th birthday celebration as a full ritual with my CelestiOwl prayerformance accompanied by other dancers and aerial artists. I will then be sharing my music on tour this Summer in Europe and Colombia, and then Africa and Asia in Fall and Winter.</p>

<p>I am so excited to be back in the studio working on my next album: <strong>Reasons</strong>.</p>
<p>But first things first. I always get asked: what kind of music do you play?  I'm never sure how to answer that. So I'll let this review of one of our shows speak for me. “<i>Grace's Morrison's music is somewhere between a rock and</i><i> a hard place. It slides into the cracks and crevices of things that get overlooked. She is folk. She is pop. She’s unbelievably masterful behind the wheel of a guitar. Morrison’s vocal storytelling can make you cry; it can make you sing</i>.”</p>
<p>So that's me. ""<strong><i>between a rock and a hard place</i></strong>"" :)</p>
<h3>What we've done and where we are</h3>
<p>After raising funds for my first EP (Redemption) through collecting cans (5 cents at a time) and then funding my first full length album (I'm the Apple) through bar gigs, I'm starting over again.  But this time we are aiming higher. It's not just about getting an album finished. We are going to promote the album with some amazing visual artists, we are going to tour to support the album and we are going to promote the album relentlessly. </p>
<p>Here's the cool part, I've lined up the very best resources to work on this project. <strong>Jon Evans</strong> is producing the album. Jon has worked with the best female singer-songwriters of his generation including Tori Amos, Paula Cole, and Sarah McLachlan. </p>
<p><strong>Bryan Dos Reis</strong> is slated to help me with the visual presentation. Bryan is the man! He has worked with the likes of Jason Mraz, Guster, and Passenger. Pretty amazing, right? Check out Bryan's work...I'm lucky to have the opportunity to work with him. </p>

<h3>Where will your money go?</h3>
<p>Your money will go directly to helping me offset the costs of not only making this album and putting out into the world.  Those costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$15,000 Recording: session artists, studio costs, and mixing (I want the songs to sound amazing!)</li>
<li>$2,500 Multi-media: performance videos, photos, etc. (I want the songs to look amazing!)</li>
<li>$3,000 Touring: travel expenses and festival applications (I want to sing with you!)</li>
<li>$1,000 PR push: promotion, marketing, mailing (I want to build the community!)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The music industry is a fickle and strange place in 2018. There is so much competition. And, let's be honest I am not a great salesperson! But I am getting better. This is step one :). I can also tell you this: I have surrounded myself with like-minded hard working people. </p>
<p>But, I literally and figuratively can't do it without you.</p>
<p>This feels different than any other musical project I have ever worked on.  This record is everything to me, and it would mean the world if you would help me make it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>If you want to help but you can't financially swing it, please know that I completely understand.</p>
<p>Here's how you can help OTHER than with your money:</p>
<p>1. Share this link on all your social media accounts.  (Do it once a week, do it once a day, I just need you to tell our story to your friends.)</p>

</div></div>","I am so excited to be back in the studio working on my next album: Reasons.
But first things first. I always get asked: what kind of music do you play?  I'm never sure how to answer that. So I'll let this review of one of our shows speak for me. “Grace's Morrison's music is somewhere between a rock and a hard place. It slides into the cracks and crevices of things that get overlooked. She is folk. She is pop. She’s unbelievably masterful behind the wheel of a guitar. Morrison’s vocal storytelling can make you cry; it can make you sing.”
So that's me. ""between a rock and a hard place"" :)
What we've done and where we are
After raising funds for my first EP (Redemption) through collecting cans (5 cents at a time) and then funding my first full length album (I'm the Apple) through bar gigs, I'm starting over again.  But this time we are aiming higher. It's not just about getting an album finished. We are going to promote the album with some amazing visual artists, we are going to tour to support the album and we are going to promote the album relentlessly. 
Here's the cool part, I've lined up the very best resources to work on this project. Jon Evans is producing the album. Jon has worked with the best female singer-songwriters of his generation including Tori Amos, Paula Cole, and Sarah McLachlan. 
Bryan Dos Reis is slated to help me with the visual presentation. Bryan is the man! He has worked with the likes of Jason Mraz, Guster, and Passenger. Pretty amazing, right? Check out Bryan's work...I'm lucky to have the opportunity to work with him. 


If you want to hear the kind of music that will be on the album check out the title track:



Let's do this together
Your support means everything to me. I don't take it lightly. Every ticket you buy is appreciated. Every CD purchase and every Facebook like make a difference. I've been singing since I was a teenager and this is only my second full length album. There's a reason for that. I only want to give you my very best. Every time you tell a friend to check out my music I want them to want to hear more; to want to watch a video; to want to see me live.

What you get
I tried to come up with some unique perks.

I'd love to come play a house concert for you! 
Let's write a song together!
How about handwritten lyrics to your favorite song?
I'll be your personal jukebox...you tell me the song and we will cover it and send you a video!


Where will your money go?
Your money will go directly to helping me offset the costs of not only making this album and putting out into the world.  Those costs include:

$15,000 Recording: session artists, studio costs, and mixing (I want the songs to sound amazing!)

$3,000 Touring: travel expenses and festival applications (I want to sing with you!)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Here are some things you should know about ""A Drama with Dragons"" and its team.</p>

<h3>WE ARE DEAD AND ALIVE!</h3>
<p>Hell yeah! After a long journey our new record DEAD AND ALIVE is finally getting ready and over the last months we've been pushing boundaries to get this done. And as with TIME TEARS DOWN we followed our own path to get the challenge of an album production done.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528458671/lzbr1ghsmmbqqnhmbeeg.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>However PARASITE INC. has grown and with the new record we are facing a completely new level of financial concessions that we just can't manage all on our own anymore. So we need your help to deliver you DEAD AND ALIVE in the best way possible!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>MATH AND MONEY </h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>So we did some math to break down the cost of the entire production and ended up with a minimum goal of<strong> 10.000€</strong> to cover the cost of the production and to deliver an adequate experience:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'><strong>1500€ pressing CDs</strong><br/>...incl. a limited campaign only slipcase.</span><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>1500€ merchandise </strong><br/>...for the shirts and other merchandise that will come exclusively with this campaign.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>2000€ recording and mixing</strong><br/>We invested a lot of money into our own studio equipment over the last years, which in the long run ist much more cost-saving than spending money for external recording studios and hopefully allows us to produce new albums way faster in the future.<br/>Be assured, that we only try to recoup a very small share of those investments with this campaign!<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>2200€ quality mastering</strong> <br/>Again we place our trust in the wonderful people at Fascination Street Studios who did an awesome job for TIME TEARS DOWN.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>1500 € video production</strong><br/>Shooting a music video and creating lyric videos is expensive but almost obligatory.<br/>Help us out!<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>700 € print and promotion</strong><br/>Releasing a new album requires a lot of small marketing investments from simple flyers to advertisement in magazines and backdrops for the stage for example.<br/> </li>
<li> <strong>600 € funding fees </strong><br/>...for the campaign goal and the exchange fee.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>In addition we seek for your support to be able to fullfill many of the requests you sent us over the last years. Requests like ""come to my (name of your country here)"", ""release vinyls"", ""make hoodies"" or ""where's the new music?"". Requests like these unfortunately almost always require one thing: Financial power. So here's the chance for all of us to see how far we can come with the funding and set these things into a more realistic light. </span><br/> </p>
</div><h3>THE PERKS IN DETAIL</h3><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Crowdfunding always is giving and taking! So what are you going to get back for your support? Find it out here:  </span></p><ul>

<li>
<strong>THE COMPLETE EDITION</strong> is an extened version of THE COLLECTORS EDITION and limited irrevocably to 7! You will get one of the last(!) remaining physical copies of our 2010 debut PARASITE INC. The copies once went to Japan and after over 8 years and a 16.000 km journey, we were finally able to bring them back to Germany... just to extend their journey into your hands! <br/><br/>Also you will get one of the last copies of the rare 'Local Underground Sampler II'. The sampler contains the demo of the song 'Pulse of the Dead' and was released back in early 2012 right before we started with the recordings to TIME TEARS DOWN. At that time we contributed to the sampler alongside other local metal bands and friends to support the local metal scene around our hometown Aalen. <br/><br/>And last but not least we will add our guitar picks, signed drum sticks, poster and a PARASITE INC. patch to make this package worth its name.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526022374/asvwdz2i59tjncddtjp9.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/> </li>

Hell yeah! After a long journey our new record DEAD AND ALIVE is finally getting ready and over the last months we've been pushing boundaries to get this done. And as with TIME TEARS DOWN we followed our own path to get the challenge of an album production done.However PARASITE INC. has grown and with the new record we are facing a completely new level of financial concessions that we just can't manage all on our own anymore. So we need your help to deliver you DEAD AND ALIVE in the best way possible! 

MATH AND MONEY 
So we did some math to break down the cost of the entire production and ended up with a minimum goal of 10.000€ to cover the cost of the production and to deliver an adequate experience:


1500€ pressing CDs...incl. a limited campaign only slipcase. 

1500€ merchandise ...for the shirts and other merchandise that will come exclusively with this campaign. 

2000€ recording and mixingWe invested a lot of money into our own studio equipment over the last years, which in the long run ist much more cost-saving than spending money for external recording studios and hopefully allows us to produce new albums way faster in the future.Be assured, that we only try to recoup a very small share of those investments with this campaign! 

2200€ quality mastering Again we place our trust in the wonderful people at Fascination Street Studios who did an awesome job for TIME TEARS DOWN. 

1500 € video productionShooting a music video and creating lyric videos is expensive but almost obligatory.Help us out! 

700 € print and promotionReleasing a new album requires a lot of small marketing investments from simple flyers to advertisement in magazines and backdrops for the stage for example. 
 600 € funding fees ...for the campaign goal and the exchange fee.

In addition we seek for your support to be able to fullfill many of the requests you sent us over the last years. Requests like ""come to my (name of your country here)"", ""release vinyls"", ""make hoodies"" or ""where's the new music?"". Requests like these unfortunately almost always require one thing: Financial power. So here's the chance for all of us to see how far we can come with the funding and set these things into a more realistic light.  
THE PERKS IN DETAILCrowdfunding always is giving and taking! So what are you going to get back for your support? Find it out here:  

THE DOWNLOAD This is the basic package and is included in all perks! Get our new album DEAD AND ALIVE as a digital download and a media package with digital booklet, 4k wallpapers, tabulatures and access to exclusive vlogs.  

THE LIMITED ALBUM The classic CD - Exclusively for the funding, all CDs come with a limited and handnumbered slipcase and stickers. It won't be available anymore with the official preorder or when the album is officially released. 

THE LIMITED SHIRT This is just the shirt (but of course also including THE DOWNLOAD). The shirt will be a funding exclusive design...and all evidence is going to be destroyed after ;) 

SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY! Well, it is what it says. Get THE DOWNLOAD but we appreciate the extra bucks with your name in the CD and digital booklet. 

THE BUNDLE The allrounder. Get THE DOWNLOAD,  THE LIMITED ALBUM and THE LIMITED SHIRT.  

THE EXTENDED BUNDLE It's basically the bundle but the band will autograph your copy of DEAD AND ALIVE  and add a personal message on an autograph card (we will be creative ;) ).  Also, we appreciate the extra bucks with your name in the CD and digital booklet. 

THE COLLECTORS EDITION will contain just everything what is available in the campaign (except for the hire kai perk and complete edition) + a signed copy of DEAD AND ALIVE and TIME TEARS DOWN + we go back to our old school days and deliver you a hand made and hand numbered special CD  named UNRELEASHED. For the CD we checked our archives to unearth some unreleased and very rare demos of our songs.  

THE COMPLETE EDITION is an extened version of THE COLLECTORS EDITION and limited irrevocably to 7! You will get one of the last(!) remaining physical copies of our 2010 debut PARASITE INC. The copies once went to Japan and after over 8 years and a 16.000 km journey, we were finally able to bring them back to Germany... just to extend their journey into your hands! Also you will get one of the last copies of the rare 'Local Underground Sampler II'. The sampler contains the demo of the song 'Pulse of the Dead' and was released back in early 2012 right before we started with the recordings to TIME TEARS DOWN. At that time we contributed to the sampler alongside other local metal bands and friends to support the local metal scene around our hometown Aalen. And last but not least we will add our guitar picks, signed drum sticks, poster and a PARASITE INC. patch to make this package worth its name. 

HIRE KAI -  Do you have a band? Want him to do some crime on your songs? Here's your chance to get his flowery voice on your track or let him break his fingers to your song with a guitar solo!

<p>
</p><p>
I, Nick, Nicolas, have lived in
Brighton for 11 years. Spent my entire adult life here. But now I'm
leaving. And I've written an album to say goodbye to the place. A
record that starts with a lament, a raw account of heartbreak a year
from the end of a seven year relationship with the love of my life,
and ends with a bittersweet farewell to the hipster fishing village
I've called home for over a decade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I, Nick, Nicolas, started Nicolas
and the Saints as a solo electronic project. But now it's grown to a
five-piece live band. And as a five-piece live band, we want to make
a record the old-fashioned way. Two days in a high-end London studio
with a hotshot young producer. Everything played live. No electronic
trickery bar the odd guitar pedal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
We, Nicolas and the Saints, have
rehearsed the living hell out of it. Played it live and worked out
the kinks. Put together an album that veers between unhinged
jazz-rap, existential blues and traditional bar ballads. That traces
my, Nick, Nicolas' last year of my twenties, coloured with electric
guitar, upright bass, saxophone, drums and vocals. </p><p>It will sound a bit like, but much nicer than, this live performance we did at The Good Ship in London:</p><p><a href=""http://livamp.com/performances/nicolasandsaints-goodship/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://livamp.com/performances/nicolasandsaints-goodship/</a><br/></p>

I would often do solo performances for my church and weddings as well. I accompanied myself with a guitar and often I would have someone accompany me on the piano. In my early 20's I had all the attributes of a light opera singer. I received no prior training. In my late 20's I became more involved with singing in bands during the 80's Punk &amp; New Wave scene, however, like many of us life happened and I soon lost that zest for creativity. I had a very difficult life &amp; difficulty maintaining a menial job due to my vision impairment in which I am now receiving assistance for my basic living needs. In 2011 it occurred to me that I was once upon a time a talented singer &amp; lyricist so I decided to go back to my roots with writing &amp; singing. I am now a viral success as I have been involved in the music industry since 2011 and doing well, however, I work with 2 primary artists who happened to both reside in the U.K. and both artists have asked me to fly to London to do a series of shows with them in the U.K. I am on a fixed income therefore I need funding for the trip to and back to the U.S. I truly believe that this trip will make or break what I've been doing with music over the internet with these very talented European instrumental composers over the last 5 years. The first artist I work with is Nature Of Wires who back in the 80's &amp; early 90's did a great deal of production &amp; live shows so this artist is established quite notably and the second artist runs a quite large number in his band called Real Experts who have been performing &amp; producing since the 80's. Both bands are in the genre of Future &amp; Synthpop with a touch of Electro &amp; EBM. Your generous contribution to my campaign will enable me to not only have the opportunity to branch out but it will allow the first artist (Nature Of Wires) &amp; CountessM to launch the release of our forthcoming album entitled ""Cyber Rendezvous"" more effectively and at a much quicker pace. As for Real Experts &amp; CountessM your contribution will allow our forthcoming single to also have a quick launch. <br/>

In 2011 it occurred to me that I was once upon a time a talented singer & lyricist so I decided to go back to my roots with writing & singing. I am now a viral success as I have been involved in the music industry since 2011 and doing well, however, I work with 2 primary artists who happened to both reside in the U.K. and both artists have asked me to fly to London to do a series of shows with them in the U.K. I am on a fixed income therefore I need funding for the trip to and back to the U.S. I truly believe that this trip will make or break what I've been doing with music over the internet with these very talented European instrumental composers over the last 5 years. The first artist I work with is Nature Of Wires who back in the 80's & early 90's did a great deal of production & live shows so this artist is established quite notably and the second artist runs a quite large number in his band called Real Experts who have been performing & producing since the 80's. Both bands are in the genre of Future & Synthpop with a touch of Electro & EBM. Your generous contribution to my campaign will enable me to not only have the opportunity to branch out but it will allow the first artist (Nature Of Wires) & CountessM to launch the release of our forthcoming album entitled ""Cyber Rendezvous"" more effectively and at a much quicker pace. As for Real Experts & CountessM your contribution will allow our forthcoming single to also have a quick launch. 
 Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:  Introduce yourself and your background. Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you. Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.  Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.    The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust.    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
