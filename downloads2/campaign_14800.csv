What is this?
Anne Frank n' Stein is the story never written in the diary, presented as a 5-issue comic series.
Prepare for a shocking ride as Anne proves herself more resourceful than the Nazis anticipated when they raid her secret attic. With the help of a monster created out of corpses and science she escapes to rescue her family which has been taken by the Third Reich.
However, the Nazis have secret experimental science of their own. Will Anne literally raise all Hell in return for her family's safety?
 
 
This comic project started out as a ballsy idea and a labor of love, but quickly turned into something much, much bigger. With a daring narrative written by Ezra Nickel and colorful art by Rifka Kremer, Anne Frank n' Stein is a story you need to read to believe.   Where is the money going?
 The best part is, the first issue already exists!  All funding for the initial goal of $3000 will be going into publishing paper copies of Anne Frank n' Stein which can be ordered and shipped to you in addition to being sold at our local Comic Convention in Winnipeg, Canada. 
 We are taking NO PROFIT from the first issue, only trying to get this story out to the world.
We've  COMMITTED to this series now that we've reached 60% and ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH ISSUES #2-#5!
    
but WHY?
 We realize that the nature of our subject material is shocking. However, having each read the Diary of Anne Frank, it is clear that she was a young woman with an incredibly tenacious spirit and hope in the face of adversity. 
Our story takes events and individuals from the WWII era and injects them with the fantastical. We try to channel Anne's unbreakable spirit and explore what choices she might make given a completely different set of resources... and access to dark science.
    
So what's the Risk?
 Our venture comes at incredibly low risk to you, the Supporter.   
The first issue is practically ready to go and the four other issues are outlined in detail.
 The Publishing and shipping process can begin as soon the campaign ends, given that the perks will be received whether or not we meet our goal full goal (We've done well enough to reward our backers).

If our goal is achieved, however, you can expect new issues to become available on a tri-monthly basis! So, if we complete our crowd-funding by the middle of April, you can expect Issue #2 by mid-August!

 If you are new to Max Boost, WELCOME!  And please watch the video above and keep reading below!Max Boost on the cover of Import Tuner for the first time ever.Max Boost is a story about Max and Otto, and their adventures in Motorville as Max, a hyperactive boy that dreams of horsepower and fast cars, and Otto, his trusty sidekick and voice of reason, are best friends.They love cars and racing, and hope to have a racecar of their own one day so they can challenge the town bully, Todd, to a race to put him in his place.Since his birthday is coming, Max THINKS his Mom is going to get him his dream car - an Integra Type-R, so he can finally beat Todd's V8 in a race - but Instead.......his mom gets him a base model Civic Hatchback. No air conditioning, no electric windows or seats, and most importantly - no horsepower. And it's even GREEN.  (Oh no!)But, there is not turning back for Max, as the race is still on.Everyone at Motorville High School will be watching - and Max can't back out now.  He's hoping for a miracle.And, for the first time ever, he meets Todd at the local street races, ready or not.Well, Max is definitely ""NOT"".And so begins, Max's quest to keep himself from embarrassment, and for horsepower leads him to tuner culture and fast and furious hi-jinx.             ...Meanwhile a bigger threat to ALL of Motorville looms overhead, and Motorville's existence is in question.And from there, close to 200 total pages of Max Boost have been published to date about the misadventures begins - from tuning upgrades, to police, drag racing, drifting, burnouts and togue the story takes many twists and turns.  There is fun around every corner!Max Boost Volume 1 has 100 Pages of the original comic, plus 50 pages of extras and never before seen art and is only available here on Indiegogo for you to enjoy.  And exclusively for this launch campaign, you can get add-ons and never before seen extras (see below)!WELCOME TO MOTORVILLE!Max Boost - He is the underdog, and our unlikely hero.  Max is absolutely passionate about cars and racing, and will do anything it takes to find, build, and race the car of his dreams.  His number one enemy is Todd, and he is committed to bringing street-justice to Motorville by having Todd pay for all of the horrible things he does to those who have less horsepower than him.  And, as the story develops, we find out what roles these characters play, as the very existence of Motorville may actually depend on this young group of street-rascals... Otto - is Max's best friend and voice of reason.  Otto is basically the opposite of Max, as he is calm, collected, and is always thinking wisely.  However, he also knows it's almost impossible to stop Max when he has a ""great idea"", and knows it's better just get out of his way (and sometimes more entertaining!).  As a master tactician, Otto, has the skill of gently guiding Max along so he doesn't hurt himself... too much. Todd -  Big V8, BIG Pistons, and even BIGGER EGO.  Todd is the town jock that you love to hate, and he makes it a ""sport"" to harass Max and Otto, and anyone else under 500 horsepower.  Maybe one day, Max and Otto will be able to teach him a lesson in humility, but they will need to find some horsepower and torque first! Papa Wheely and his henchmen, Yin, Yan and Wok - He has the Horsepower and Torque!  Papa Wheely is the Proprietor of Papa Wheely's Performance Pagoda.  He's the one to see if you want you tuner car, tuned - but for a PRICE!AND, if you don't make your payments on time, you may end up meeting the his ""Wu Tang Wack!""Ese and 'Efe - The leaders of the Low Rider crew from Low Co., Ese and Efe' patrol the streets of Lotting Park - with 3 wheel motion, on chrome & white walls.  Don't get caught by them at the wrong time, in the wrong place, or you might find yourself getting ""hit by switches"". And, that's not all, there are many, many more characters in Max Boost for you to meet! PLAYWIth ~150 pages, the First 4 years of comics (1998-2002 for Volume 1) plus never-before-seen art in a gorgeous, collectible hardcover, exclusively only for pre-order here: BEAUTIFUL, HEAVY WEIGHT, PREMIUM hard bound bookPrint size is just like original with heavy 150g PaperGlossy Printed Dust cover!and Heavy Weight Collectors Sleeve!

These stories kept reminding me that I should never have stopped drawing Max Boost- and if Max Boost, Volume 1 is successful -  I can bring Max Boost back for the next generation of tuner fans! Even though I took a mental break for 10 years, inspiration came in an unlikely event.  My younger brother (he's 18 years younger than me) got into the tuner scene (on his own, I had no influnce I swear!) and eventually asked me to bring him to the racetrack for the first time. And little did he know, combined with support from one of our original Max Boost + Autocannon crew Memo Quibrera, and jumping into Sam Rothschilds Honda Challenge Series championship winning CRX racecar for the first time in YEARS - they reignited my need for speed, and my itch to bring Max Boost back! - WHY I AM ON INDIEGOGO - So why am I on Indiegogo?I put over a decade of my life and sweat into Max Boost.  I invested everything I could to continue to make Max Boost for the people, and pursued the dream furiously.8 years into it, in 2006, Everything was going perfect and Max Boost was on a roll.  We got some serious momentum when we partnered with Playmates Toys (the Ninja Turtle Company) to make Max Boost Toys and we were even on our way to landing video games, and a deal for Saturday Morning Cartoons with Warner Bros.  And then suddenly, the WB contract was cancelled -I hit rock bottom [Lost almost everything, and stopped drawing Max Boost to take a mental break.  I was devastated, as everything seemed to have fallen apart, and the hard work from so many was not actualized.And, well, my “short"" mental break ended up being more than 10 years.  I never stopped believing in Max Boost.  I never stopped loving cars, comics, and this culture.So I'm here, to put the control back in my hands - and build a MAX BOOST TEAM with YOU (yes YOU) - to launch more products that YOU WANT TO SEE without needing the studios or big names.  I realized with the power of community, we can actually do this independently.So Max Boost Volume 1 is the FIRST step of MANY.  So, if this campaign is successful, it will allow us to continue with our NEXT STEPS:Max Boost Volume 2AnimationToysNetflix Show? :)AND MORE.... Like my own life, Max Boost is a true Underdog story, where you're put up against all odds and still have to find a way to succeed.  Max Boost was simply a dream, and though hard work, long nights sleeping under drawing tables, and being a starving artist (literally), I was able to create something that fans worldwide loved.Max Boost is perfect for all gear heads, tuners, and comicbook fans looking for something that has deep roots and history in the Car Culture Or anyone who just love anime, cars, hispeed hijinx, and a good ol' underdog story about a little hatch back “that could"".Unfortunately, this Max Boost, Volume 1 that I am holding in the video is just a prototype (1 of 1), and need Pre-Orders here on Indiegogo to hit our printers minimums.   We have a limited time to gather orders, and to make the revival with Max Boost Volume 1,  a reality!So this is where YOU come in...Max Boost is ONLY available here, at a discount, with Bonuses in hopes you will become part of the Max Boost Fam reserve your very own limited first edition copies, today,Simply click below to ""Back this Project"" to keep this dream alive!Please pledge today, share with your friends, and become part of Team Max Boost!Drive Fast.

Well, if you choose to back us you can expect:$10 level - Printed copy of The Alchemist #1 and small print (6x9).$20 level - Printed copy of The Alchemist #1 and large print (11x17).$35 level - Printed copy of The Alchemist #1 and Nefarious Publishing t-shirt.$45 level - Printed copy of The Alchemist #1, large (11x17) print, and Nefarious Publishing t-shirt.$70 level - 2 printed copies of The Alchemist #1, one standard and one with plastic-framed sketch cover with original oil painting on it.$100 level - All items from other pledge levels. Includes 2 printed copies of The Alchemist #1, one standard and one with plastic-framed sketch cover with original oil painting on it, Nefarious Publishing t-shirt, one small pint (6x9), and one large (11x17) print.This is just for starters too! We plan on making a bunch more issues so you can expect the perks to get better as we are able to produce more cool stuff thanks to backers like (hopefully) you!The ImpactIf we reach our goal we will not only be able to put the book (and other cool stuff) in the hands of all our backers, it will also allow us to produce enough copies, and afford travel expenses, to get off the ground during convention season to share with as many people as possible!Risks & ChallengesThe main thing that comes to mind here is time. We both have full-time day jobs and work on comics in our free time. Therefore we produce content as quickly as we can and aim to produce a new issue every few months, but sometimes life happens and delays can occur. Rest assured that we will honor every pledge and every order received as quickly as we can. We will get you your stuff!!!Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand if you are not ready to support us yet. You have your reasons! However, you can still help us out by getting the word out on social media, using the Indiegogo share tools, and by checking out more art and projects over at www.masonmckane.com and www.nefariouspublishing.com.Additionally, you can reach out to us at:Mason McKane: nefariousillustration@gmail.comNic McKane: nmckane@gmail.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

  Volume 1: MonstersOur mousy protagonist Willow lives in a mundane and restricted school, which ends up being the worst place someone could get gifted a magical necklace. Desperately trying to contain the magic within, this act of futility seems to just make matters worse. As the necklace crumbles the school’s secrets around her, Willow is left to wonder if it was a gift sent by friend or foe?  Volume 2: MischiefWillow, Georgia and Emma have accidentally wrapped both Tillie and Aaron into their magical girl shenanigans much to their chagrin. However, things seem to be getting even harder to keep quiet as these magical powers have turned from intriguing to infectious.  Between daylight daydreams, tanking a track star, bathroom breakdowns and betrayal from within - our quarreling quintet might be in bigger trouble then they ever thought possible.  Volume 3: MaliceThe infection has spread beyond control, their quiet home a prison. Willow and the rest of the XII, incapacitated and injured, try desperately to make sense of the world they never knew they lived in. Trapped in the claws of the Headmistress and their necklaces confiscated - the only thing the girls have left: is escape. XII: Of Magic and Muses has been published online as a webcomic since 2016 and after 5 magical years we're finishing off the trilogy in print - before the website finishes Volume 2!

My name is Mysh, visual storytelling is my trade and my passion. I make comics and films, both animated and live-action. ""Imaginary Encounters"" is my most personal and most ambitious project to-date, and in it all the things I love to do and to tell about come together.
About Haiku-Comics
Based on a traditional Japanese format of three-line poems, the Haiku-comics are short graphic and video pieces that use words and images to capture moments in life – of love and sexual desire, heartbreak and joy. Through the Haiku I tell stories that express my own feelings and views (that's why most of the Haiku are about men loving men). This project is hard to fit into existing formats. Because of this, ""Imaginary Encounters"" began its run at the place where boundaries tend to blur – the Internet. For two years the Haiku project ran online as a series of comics and video shorts, resulting in fifty-and-counting pieces. Now I want to take it to the next level.
The Book of Haiku-comics
Though the Haikus exist now in the digital form, they are all hand-drawn, and my dream is to enable the readers to experience them in the way closest to the originals. So my first goal is to produce, print and distribute a hardcover collection of ""Imaginary Encounters"" series – a book that will include the first 50 Haikus. The book itself  will be an art object designed to honor the content.
The Original Art Plates
""Imaginary Encounters"" is as much a fine art project as it is a series of comics. As part of the process of bringing it back to its paper form, I want to make original plates of selected Haikus, each limited to 25 or 50 prints in beautiful silk-screen printing technique.
The Series of Haiku-videos
Like the comics,  Haiku-videos are black-and-white silent shorts, capturing moments when Life becomes Poetry. To this day, I've made only three Haiku-videos, but there are much more I want to make, creating a full-scale series

What do we need?
Our ultimate goal is to raise $60.000, which will enable us to make all parts of the project happen: the book, the art plates,  and ultimately, bring Imaniary Encounters to life on the screen as a video series.
The first $20.000 will enable us to edit, design, print and ship the book, using the best quality materials, 
$30.000 will make it possible to build the Imaginary Encounters' official website, and to create the original plates for selected Haikus, which can be ordered and bought through the website
And finally, reaching the $60.000 will enable the Haiku-videos series to begin. That means that during the next two years I will produce and direct various Haiku shorts, bringing the total number of episodes to 20. They will run on the Haiku project official website, and hopefully will find their way to film festivals and international distribution.
This all will result in a massive LGBT art project that defies boundaries of both gender and media. If you feel it's a good cause to support – here's your opportunity!

Enter young micropublisher <a href=""http://riggedbooks.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rigged Books</a>, run by yours truly, Kyle Petersen, who gets a table at TCAF a mere few months after my first publication, <a href=""http://riggedbooks.bigcartel.com/product/cat-city-limited-preorder"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cat City by Liz Lehman</a>, is released to critical praise.</p><p>Going to TCAF as a publisher has been a dream of mine for nearly a decade and I'd like to do something very special for it, so I'm working with two artists who need a substantial work to showcase their talents, those two being <a href=""http://dangerschwartz.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mia Schwartz</a> and <a href=""http://b-m-f-u.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ben Urkowitz,</a> and I'm working with <a href=""http://www.colourcodeprinting.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Colour Code Printing</a> of Toronto and their Risograph printers to produce beautiful 2-color books that double both as great works of comics and gorgeous art objects.</p><p>I've covered my own travel expenses, the cost of the table and the advance payment to each artist for their work, so what I next need your help with is the following:</p><ul>
<li>$2500 for the printing and shipping costs on these new books</li>
<li>$300 travel stipend for the artists (total)</li>
<li>~$150-300 for Indiegogo fees</li>
<li>The remainder goes to producing and shipping other rewards for the campaign</li>
</ul><h3>We have stretch goals, should we meet our quota, that'll be revealed further as they go on:</h3><ul>
<li>$3500: full runs of both Mia's and Ben's comics at TCAF!</li>
<li>$4000: the above plus more new work from Rigged Books artist <a href=""http://octogod.tumblr.com/tagged/my_art"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Liz Lehman</a>!</li>
<li>$5000: the above plus a brand-new English-language comics debut by <a href=""http://puiupo.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paula Almeida</a>!</li>
<li>$6000: the above plus new comics from up-and-comer <a href=""http://bigfatbugbites.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vida Alcamo</a>!</li>
<li>More stretch goals TBA...</li>
</ul><h3>Supporting this campaign is supporting the artists you love.</h3><p>I care deeply about comics, so much that there's been times where they've literally saved my life. The early successes that Rigged Books has had, however modest, have made me immeasurably happy, getting to share comics I love that would otherwise have not been published. This, though, is my attempt to really make waves in the system, to put out the best new work possible, and to show the world the artists I love and the art that uplifts.</p><p>In that interest, I take no money from this personally; all money that goes through Rigged Books goes to the artists, shipping costs, and future projects.

Enter young micropublisher Rigged Books, run by yours truly, Kyle Petersen, who gets a table at TCAF a mere few months after my first publication, Cat City by Liz Lehman, is released to critical praise.Going to TCAF as a publisher has been a dream of mine for nearly a decade and I'd like to do something very special for it, so I'm working with two artists who need a substantial work to showcase their talents, those two being Mia Schwartz and Ben Urkowitz, and I'm working with Colour Code Printing of Toronto and their Risograph printers to produce beautiful 2-color books that double both as great works of comics and gorgeous art objects.I've covered my own travel expenses, the cost of the table and the advance payment to each artist for their work, so what I next need your help with is the following:
$2500 for the printing and shipping costs on these new books
$300 travel stipend for the artists (total)
~$150-300 for Indiegogo fees
The remainder goes to producing and shipping other rewards for the campaign
We have stretch goals, should we meet our quota, that'll be revealed further as they go on:
$3500: full runs of both Mia's and Ben's comics at TCAF!
$4000: the above plus more new work from Rigged Books artist Liz Lehman!
$5000: the above plus a brand-new English-language comics debut by Paula Almeida!
$6000: the above plus new comics from up-and-comer Vida Alcamo!
More stretch goals TBA...
Supporting this campaign is supporting the artists you love.I care deeply about comics, so much that there's been times where they've literally saved my life. The early successes that Rigged Books has had, however modest, have made me immeasurably happy, getting to share comics I love that would otherwise have not been published. This, though, is my attempt to really make waves in the system, to put out the best new work possible, and to show the world the artists I love and the art that uplifts.In that interest, I take no money from this personally; all money that goes through Rigged Books goes to the artists, shipping costs, and future projects. Furthermore, the drive is operating on flexible funding, to ensure that some part of the run is payed for in time for TCAF, and that even if the goal isn't hit, we have books to share.It's my sincere hope that this serves both as a staging ground for the TCAF books and a wider revelation to the comics world of the things I am working on bringing to print.

<h3>Neelakshi: The Quest for Amrit<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">By funding this project, you help us realize a dream very
close to our hearts. Since my teens I have been a big fan of comics and graphic
novels and had always wanted to create my own comic book. I also want to
explore a new genre in comics: stories inspired by the rich mythology of India
but not just retell existing mythology. With Ashok Rajagopalan, my writing
partner and published writer and illustrator of children's books, who shares
the same dream, I want to produce 'Neelakshi,' a sword and sorcery graphic
novel with a strong female protagonist, Neil.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Neil is transported to the underworld of demons where she is
Neelakshi, the promised one of prophecy. The story is her quest for amrit, the
nectar of immortality, and how she establishes peace in the three worlds of
Hindu myth.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For this project, we have enlisted the support and skills of
the talented artist Judit Tondora and the amazing colorist Roland Pilcz.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We request funding for the production of 'Neelakshi - The
Quest for Amrit' a 64 page graphic novel of the highest quality. We expect to
start a minor revolution in visual storytelling with this project.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We have created the initial pages but need funds to proceed
and ensure Neelakshi is published. We will provide regular updates at each
stage of the process as we proceed. Both of us work at our day jobs due to
financial neccessity, but hope to be doing only comic books in the future and
give pleasure to fans across the globe. We will give of our best in terms of
quality and skills, but we need your support.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I have enlisted the support of an illustrator, a colorist and a
 letterer. To pay them, I need $7000. <br/>Project duration: Four months.<br/>We already have publishers interested in the project, and it only needs the funds for execution.

</div></div>","Earth is a distant memory and the remnants of humanity now lives aboard the space station, Terralympus. Mia is one of the best engineers on Terralympus and there's never been a problem that she can't fix. It started out as a normal day with Mia showing Hanna (the new engineering recruit) the ropes. However, Mia stumbles upon a hidden conspiracy aboard Terralympus which could have serious consequences to all aboard the space station.  
Terralympus is a 48 page Black &White (GREYSCALE) graphic novel printed on 150gsm glossy interior paper and a 250gsm cardstock cover.  (For those unfamiliar with gsm, I'm a bit of a paper snob and this is high end paper!) Terralympus is standard comic book size 260mm x 170mm.

This is the perfect graphic novel for anyone who loves science fiction grounded in reality, compelling characters and an exploration of what lies out there in vast realm of space. Your help and support will bring this story to life! There is an exclusive IndieGoGo cover that will never be printed anywhere else. Only one print run of this cover will be done for this campaign and that's it!

<p>Hello! And welcome to my third Indiegogo campaign!  My name is Mike S. Miller, I'm a 27 year veteran of the comic book industry, best known for my artwork in the NYTimes best selling, and #1 digital comic book in the world, <i>INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US</i>, and <i>INJUSTICE 2 </i>for DC COMICS.  I'm also the cover artist for <i>A GAME OF THRONES</i>, you've probably heard of that one...  </p>

<p>We are ""Chevelin Illustration"" and are passionate about illustration, painting and all related to the ninth art. Our mission is to create an haitian comic inspired by the haitian culture and history. Haitian culture and history are so rich that it could inspire generations to literary, film and comics. From the first wars between the ""indians"", Native of the Hispaniola Island, and the Spanish invaders, through the arrival of slaves from Africa, the wars for the occupation of the entire island between France, Spain and England, the revolution, the role of voodoo in this fight, our ""loas"", our myths and mythical stories, independence, and even after the independence of Haiti, all this is an invaluable resource for the creation of a comic book. </p><p>Contributing to make this project come true will help us achieve a very high social, cultural and economical goal. We choose to promote the haitian culture and history by writing. By doing so, we'll help people discover this beautiful part that is characterizing Haiti. That will make people see the country with other eyes than the usual ones, we mean, the poverty-eyes.

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are ""Chevelin Illustration"" and are passionate about illustration, painting and all related to the ninth art. Our mission is to create an haitian comic inspired by the haitian culture and history. Haitian culture and history are so rich that it could inspire generations to literary, film and comics. From the first wars between the ""indians"", Native of the Hispaniola Island, and the Spanish invaders, through the arrival of slaves from Africa, the wars for the occupation of the entire island between France, Spain and England, the revolution, the role of voodoo in this fight, our ""loas"", our myths and mythical stories, independence, and even after the independence of Haiti, all this is an invaluable resource for the creation of a comic book. Contributing to make this project come true will help us achieve a very high social, cultural and economical goal. We choose to promote the haitian culture and history by writing. By doing so, we'll help people discover this beautiful part that is characterizing Haiti. That will make people see the country with other eyes than the usual ones, we mean, the poverty-eyes. Contributors to this project will help boosting career of so many talented young writers and illustrators. What We Need & What We GetWe already have the writers, strong illustrators, graphists and correctors teams, a local.

The Impact


This project is very ambitious and challenging too. But we are sure about the impact it would have in the haitian society and even in the world. Haiti is a wonderful country, but poverty does not allow people to realize how great are the haitian culture and its history. Create an haitian comic is about to give faith to the young haitians in their peers. It is about to create success story, to demonstrate how talented people can succeed in Haiti, can be famous.

Now we want to bring you more and more comics.  
Risks & Challenges
Every project, how matter great, well elaborated and prepared, comes with risks. And more ambitious and challenging is the project, more risky it is. 
First of all, launching a typical haitian comic is something new within the haitian culture. Then, we need to establish a strong promotion campaign in order to attract people. But, we must admit that the fact it is new constitutes an advantage for us. 
The printing cost and promotion campaign are high, that is why we develop strategies to promote our books:
     1- We go toward the haitian schools in order to bring the books to the students;
     2- We publish on Facebook some preview related to our books which are seen                 by more than 10,000.00 people;
Other Ways You Can Help
Help is not necessarily about giving money. You can help us making this project true by :

getting the word out and making some noise about this campaign just by using the Indiegogo share tools!

And that's all there
is to it.

<h3><strong>My name is Reginald Byers. I've professionally illustrated comic books since 1987. My passion other than drawing, is building up youth by teaching them social skills, character education and Christian discipleship.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>KIDZ OF THE KING is a Christian themed comic book I created with my wife back in 1993. It started out featuring 4 superkids (who were actually angels) named TRUTH, FAITH, MERCY and ZEAL.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The comic book has been a blessing to thousands of kids all over the country!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The only problem is that is was released irregularly due to it being a part time concentration and limited funds.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Now 20 years later, we haven't given up contuing to do Kidz, but we need financial help to create a new on-going series that we will make available to customers via our website and direct to churches, ministries and parochial schools.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h2><em><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></em></h2>
<h3><strong>We are looking to raise $2000 to pay for printing costs for at least the first 3 issues (bi-monthly releases beginning September 2013). The copies will be sold to churches for their youth groups and will also be used as curriculum booklets for parochial after-school programs. The wholesale and retail prices of the books sold will garner enough returns to fund printing for subsequent issues.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We have wonderful perks for different levels of donations from signed copies of books, exclusive posters, original art from the books, to custom drawings featuring the characters of your choice from the series!</strong></h3>

Should we exceed our goal, in addition to the new comic series, we will produce beautiful full color Kidz of the King posters as well as ""Lil' Kidz"" coloring books, a coloring book featuring little versions of the characters for K-1 age youth!
 
THE IMPACT
Your contribution to this project will not only help Kidz of the King remain steady and self sufficent, but will also aid in building up the spiritual and moral fiber in countless children in the USA and the world!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>A graduate of the University of Cincinnati with a degree in painting, P. Craig Russell has run the gamut in comics. After establishing a name for himself at Marvel on KILLRAVEN and DR. STRANGE, he went on to become one of the pioneers in opening new vistas for this underestimated field with, among other works, adaptations of operas by Mozart (THE MAGIC FLUTE), Strauss (SALOME) and Wagner (THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG). He has illustrated classic comic-book characters as diverse as Elric, The Sandman, Conan, Batman, Hellboy and The Spirit. His more recent work includes comic book adaptations of Neil Gaiman’s CORALINE and THE GRAVEYARD BOOK.</p>

<h3>Our Restoration and Preservation Process</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>First, an “Artifact Scan” will be made of the original comic art page. While appearing to be in black and white, each original art page is scanned in color to show blue pencil and other corrections. This is to create a digital file of the original page for preservation and posterity:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1336799/files/20150329153226-1._Artifact_Scan.jpg?1427668346"" src="""" style=""width: 406.62337662337666px;height: 606px;""/></p>
<p><br/>The second step will be to create a second high resolution scan—this time in black &amp; white—to capture Craig's black ink art in as pristine a manner as possible. The bitmap scan is then gone over with a fine-tooth “digital comb” to remove as many imperfections as possible—again, to capture the ink art as crisply and cleanly as possible:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1336802/files/20150329153308-2._Bitmap_Scan.jpg?1427668388"" src="""" style=""width: 441.5521885521885px;height: 659px;""/><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We then take Craig's original mixed-media hand-coloring and scan it at a very high resolution. As stated before, much of the original coloring has decayed in the past few decades. As you can see on the following raw scan, the silhouette of the running men has “mottled.” This must be repaired digitally—not to make it look as if it has been computer colored, but rather to restore it to its original, beautifully organic appearance:</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1336806/files/20150329153400-3._Original_Color_Scan.jpg?1427668440"" src="""" style=""width: 442.371020856202px;height: 650px;""/></p>
<br/>Finally, the super-sharp, original black line art is taken from our second scan and combined with the newly restored hand coloring in an <b>all-new, high resolution digital file. </b>This is the <b>cleanest, clearest presentation</b> that this stunning art has ever had—and it’s now beautifully restored and preserved for generations to come. We have already restored Page 1 as a sample and it can be seen as follows:<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This undertaking is obviously going to be extremely time-consuming, so we are raising funds for the restorations via a series of project-related campaigns. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that after we pay IndieGoGo fees, PayPal fees for credit card processing, income taxes (funds raised via crowdfunding campaigns are considered as income and thus are taxable) and the substantial costs of manufacturing and shipping our physical perks . . . not a lot of money is left over. After the dust clears, we still have to have sufficient funds remaining for the primary purpose of this campaign—the extensive restoration of the original ARIANE AND BLUEBEARD hand-colored artwork.</p>
<p><span>So we have to ""price"" our perks accordingly. We are unable to offer these physical goods at the price they would be offered for at brick and mortar retail stores or even via the product section of our websites. </span></p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you are making this project happen as a valued pledge partner. Our Artifact Prints and Artifact Folios are basically the equivalent of the books, calendars or mugs that viewers receive when donating to a PBS Pledge Drive. We hope that you will agree that our perks are much more unique and of long-lasting value.</p>

WHAT WE NEED & WHAT WE'LL DO WITH IT: 



-IF WE REACH OUR GOAL OF $3500: we will cover the illustrator's fee; the Indigogo + Paypal fees; and any additional marketing/production costs.

-IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL: we'll have to pay Indigogo a LAME additional 9% fee + Paypal fees + Feel sad about it :-( 

-IF WE EXCEED OUR GOAL: we can start production right away and use any extra funds to begin Volume 2 of this 3-part series!! YAY!!! 

-WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF: we've kept the funding goal down to the bare minimum so that we can reach our goal faster and start production sooner. 

We created the campaign teaser with literally a $0 budget and a 2-person crew...imagine what we can do with more!!!

<p>Hey there, I'm BZ Cullins, an actor, writer, producer and voice talent. </p>
<p>I've written a-day-in-the-life short film based on the DC Comics character, John Stewart, The Green Lantern. As a voice talent, I'd longed to voice the animated character, until one day, a wild hair crept up and said, ""Hey! Forget about voicing John Stewart, BE John Stewart!"" And here we are.</p>
<p>John Stewart was introduced in 1971, but didn't get much recognition until he was made a series regular in the animated hit Justice League/Justice League Unlimited from 2001-2004 on Cartoon Network. Since then, the character has become immensely popular. Comic book fans, like myself, the world over, are in dire need to see this character come to the live screen. And here we are.</p>
<p>We have one film starring the character recently released online and it's doing very well. So much so, it's been written up in DC Comics News.</p>
<p>The article:</p>

<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need </strong></u></p>
<p>We need to raise $11,000  in order to shoot the film. Shooting will take place In Las Vegas as soon as possible.   </p>
<p>Covered costs...</p>
<p>Equipment, props, location rentals, food, cast (all parts paid), crew, insurance, pre and post production and distribution. Your generosity will help fund a project that will definitely geek out the multitude.</p>
<p>In return, you can choose from the different perks that allows you to be a part of our process.</p>

<p>The majority of the book is done.  I'm currently adding more pages to punch up the action and show more of Stump's origin.  The first printing was 28 pages, but the book is currently sitting at 32 pages, with more being added.  I've also increased the font size, which requires me to rewrite almost all of the dialog.  </p>
<p>Since, I am doing all of the writing, art, coloring, and lettering myself, I am able to keep my costs low.  So, my primary funding goal is to cover the printing costs and postage for mailing the book out to backers.  Fulfillment will be my number one priority.  After that, if I can make enough of a profit to continue creating new issues of Stump, that would be a dream come true.</p>
<p>Stump is a superhero that I created, in 1993, while I was in the Army and it's always been my dream to make a comic book series with him as the starring character.  In addition to completing issue #1 for this campaign, I am also working on writing and drawing out issue #2 (with a few pages of issue 2 already drawn out).  My plan is to start a second campaign for Stump #2 as soon as this campaign is successfully completed and in fulfillment.  Then I hope to do it all again for issues 3, 4, 5 and so on.</p>

Some kind words/gestures for DESPAIR, previous:

""The Black Riders and Other Lines,"" from Despair vol. 1, a ""Notable Comic,"" from The Best American Comics 2014, Series Editor, Bill Kartalopoulos
""Dockery's  books are far from perfect, but they give a sense that he is on a mission...I'd say he's probably just crazy—often it amounts to the same thing.""  Aaron Lange
""Dockery’s roads map the South beyond Gothic into the teratogenic. They extend the polite dreams of the Surrealists into preternatural nightmare. You laugh here – and immediately consider critical self-examination."" Bob Levin, The Comics Journal

THE MISSION, THE MESSAGE:
I, J.T. Dockery, have gathered my own inks and the force of inks of the of others to publish two volumes in two years and now the third, and final volume, in a third year, under the Despair mantle.  An exegesis on the titular subject, a ritual, an ink as blood sacrifice, not to wallow in the subject matter but use metaphor/s in  comics/s from to work through it, grapple with it.
I have used and now am using for the third, and final time, the crowdfunding model to raise money for printing by virtue of preorders and affordable original art in various price packages.  This serves both the ability to produce the work in the format I believe most fully serves the content without concern to the somewhat arbitrary limitations of commercial publishing and serves the ability to be able to fund this dream as I am a disabled artist, in the government designation of the term these last four to five years, drawing through arthritis, as I have created through arthritic hands all of my adult life.

THE MONEY:
2,038.61 dollars is needed for the print job of 250 copies, the estimate from the printer.  I am using the same local printer I have used previously for IN TONGUES ILLUSTRATED, SPUD CRAZY, and the previous two volumes of DESPAIR. 
Additional money above printing costs is to pay my guest artists for their contributions, and to be used towards promotion and travel of the finished book.
WHAT YOU GET IS A 38 PAGE OVERSIZED 9 BY 12 INCH SUBVERSIVE UNDERGROUND COMIC BOOK IN GLORIOUS BLACK AND WHITE: 
There is no such thing as failure.  The book will be printed.  All orders will be honored/fulfilled.  My track record for the previous two volumes is the proof/the track record I can provide.
I have partnered with Institute 193 on these three volumes as de facto ""publisher,"" but being a non profit, they serve in a capacity of moral support and after the fact distribution; it is strictly my own burden to make the book happen.

Smith</b> - Served in the United States Army in Korea and the continental United States, and with the United States Air Force / Air National Guard, deploying overseas twice under Operation Enduring Freedom following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. He holds an Associate Degree in Law Enforcement and a Bachelor Degree in Business Management, but writing is his passion. He is a published novelist and often cannot seem to write fast enough to keep up with all the stories in his head.<br/>Glenn started writing at the age of 14, but didn’t seriously consider striving toward getting published until well into his twenties. He began writing ""Star Trek Phase II: Illustrated"" in 2010, and that venture led him to found Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC with that title’s artist, Bill Lutz, and ""Star Trek Phase II"" actor Charles Root. Glenn’s goal for the company is to present intriguing stories in the science-fiction, fantasy, mystery, and paranormal genres that will entertain readers to the fullest.<br/><br/><b>Bill Lutz</b> – Works as an independent illustrator and cartoonist. He has been working both for fun and professionally for the last twenty years. He graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 1988 with a degree in Illustration and Design with a minor in Creative Writing.<br/>Bill has been a fan of comic books since he purchased his first ""Fantastic Four"" comic book back in the 1970s at age 12. He has been drawing since he was six years old. He began drawing ""Star Trek Phase II: Illustrated"" back in 2010, which eventually lead to a partnership with Glenn and the forming of Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC. Bill is looking forward to releasing new titles, including his long awaited ""Return of the Frontiersmen,"" and to supervising new artwork and digital comics through Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC.<br/>A die hard ""Star Trek"" fan, Bill has enjoyed all of the TV series and the first 10 ""Star Trek"" movies. He is also a fan of animation ranging from the Warner Bros Classics all the way to the current computer animations styles of today.<br/>Bill’s biggest goal for Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC as art director is to ensure quality and exciting artwork, a diverse subject matter, and to ensure readers have a great time enjoying all the company's work.<br/><br/><b>Rob Barnes</b> – He is a self-taught artist and musician currently living in far away Auckland, New Zealand. After working in the tire business for 15 years he decided it was time for a change and began to pursue his passion for art. After two years of learning Photoshop and 3D modeling in Maya, Rob and his brothers started the iPhone game development company Squidjuice. He works as the lead artist and is involved in creating concept art, in-game art, and 3D models. Squidjuice has released three games to date: “UDF,"" “UDF Spitfire,” and their latest game “Buck Rogers Begins-Mission To Saturn.” Rob has also been involved with the “Star Trek Phase 2 Illustrated” comic book with Glenn and Bill as colorist.<br/>Rob’s love of comics goes back to his youth, getting his first comic, “Green Lantern 173” in 1984. Since then his passion for the medium has only grown and he is looking forward to bringing that passion to D.P.M.<br/><br/><b>Charles Root Jr</b>. – Holds a Master’s Degree in Management of Information Systems as well as other degrees in Computer and Political Science. He has worked in the finance and Intellectual Property industries for over 20 years, but has an alter ego that is light years away from his day job.<br/>Charles plays the role of Commander Montgomery Scott “Scotty” in the most successful Star Trek fan film series ever produced, ""Star Trek Phase II."" Secretly studying theater and modern dance while in college eventually paid off when years later he landed the roll while working as a production assistant on that series.<br/>While unable to draw a straight line to save his life, he does excel at writing, having written many technical pieces for the I.T. industry, and is parlaying that experience into writing for screen as well as into writing a title for Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC. Charles’ love of comics goes all the way back to his youth, when he would spend many a summer hour buried between the pages of ""Richie Rich,"" ""Casper,"" and ""G.I. Joe"" comics.<br/></p></span></span><p></p>

<p>When humans first set foot on Mars and discover ancient alien technology buried there, That discovery sets off a colonization push that centuries later transforms Mars into an independent world, free of the Earth government's shackles. Now bitter enemies, Mars and Earth fight an ongoing and devastating war for control of the red planet, believing there may exist there more alien technology yet to be discovered. A shocking discovery not only proves both sides wrong, but also warns that mankind may have awakened a power that neither side is ready to understand, let alone control.</p>

<h3>So What Do We Need?<br/>
</h3>
<p>As we said earlier, some of the work to get these titles published has already been done. Our goal is to have at least six issues of each title completely done by launch day. Much of the stories have already been written. Some issues have been drawn, some have been inked, and some have even been colored and just await lettering. Others still need a lot of art work done to finish them off. <br/></p>
<p>We are seeking $25,000 to reach our a goal of 5 titles each with 6 issues completed. Your donations will be spent in the following manner:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring of 3 or more contract artist to pencil and ink issues.<br/>
</li>

Founded by a team of writers and artists, Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC or D.P.M. in short, is ""IMAGINATION UNLEASHED"".At D.P.M. we are working to bring you original stories set in brand new realities that will always entertain, sometimes inform, and perhaps on occasion even provoke.We love comics and telling stories through art as much as you do, and we intend to bring that passion to each and every series we produce.We at D.P.M. are looking to you to help us bring to market an initial launch of five comic book titles. Much of the work is already done, and we just need some capital to help carry us across the finish line, but more on that later. First, who are the guys who make up Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC?
The D.P.M. Team!

Glenn E. Smith - Served in the United States Army in Korea and the continental United States, and with the United States Air Force / Air National Guard, deploying overseas twice under Operation Enduring Freedom following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. He holds an Associate Degree in Law Enforcement and a Bachelor Degree in Business Management, but writing is his passion. He is a published novelist and often cannot seem to write fast enough to keep up with all the stories in his head.Glenn started writing at the age of 14, but didn’t seriously consider striving toward getting published until well into his twenties. He began writing ""Star Trek Phase II: Illustrated"" in 2010, and that venture led him to found Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC with that title’s artist, Bill Lutz, and ""Star Trek Phase II"" actor Charles Root. Glenn’s goal for the company is to present intriguing stories in the science-fiction, fantasy, mystery, and paranormal genres that will entertain readers to the fullest.Bill Lutz – Works as an independent illustrator and cartoonist. He has been working both for fun and professionally for the last twenty years. He graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 1988 with a degree in Illustration and Design with a minor in Creative Writing.Bill has been a fan of comic books since he purchased his first ""Fantastic Four"" comic book back in the 1970s at age 12. He has been drawing since he was six years old. He began drawing ""Star Trek Phase II: Illustrated"" back in 2010, which eventually lead to a partnership with Glenn and the forming of Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC. Bill is looking forward to releasing new titles, including his long awaited ""Return of the Frontiersmen,"" and to supervising new artwork and digital comics through Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC.A die hard ""Star Trek"" fan, Bill has enjoyed all of the TV series and the first 10 ""Star Trek"" movies. He is also a fan of animation ranging from the Warner Bros Classics all the way to the current computer animations styles of today.Bill’s biggest goal for Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC as art director is to ensure quality and exciting artwork, a diverse subject matter, and to ensure readers have a great time enjoying all the company's work.Rob Barnes – He is a self-taught artist and musician currently living in far away Auckland, New Zealand. After working in the tire business for 15 years he decided it was time for a change and began to pursue his passion for art. After two years of learning Photoshop and 3D modeling in Maya, Rob and his brothers started the iPhone game development company Squidjuice. He works as the lead artist and is involved in creating concept art, in-game art, and 3D models. Squidjuice has released three games to date: “UDF,"" “UDF Spitfire,” and their latest game “Buck Rogers Begins-Mission To Saturn.” Rob has also been involved with the “Star Trek Phase 2 Illustrated” comic book with Glenn and Bill as colorist.Rob’s love of comics goes back to his youth, getting his first comic, “Green Lantern 173” in 1984. Since then his passion for the medium has only grown and he is looking forward to bringing that passion to D.P.M.Charles Root Jr. – Holds a Master’s Degree in Management of Information Systems as well as other degrees in Computer and Political Science. He has worked in the finance and Intellectual Property industries for over 20 years, but has an alter ego that is light years away from his day job.Charles plays the role of Commander Montgomery Scott “Scotty” in the most successful Star Trek fan film series ever produced, ""Star Trek Phase II."" Secretly studying theater and modern dance while in college eventually paid off when years later he landed the roll while working as a production assistant on that series.While unable to draw a straight line to save his life, he does excel at writing, having written many technical pieces for the I.T. industry, and is parlaying that experience into writing for screen as well as into writing a title for Dragon Phoenix Media, LLC. Charles’ love of comics goes all the way back to his youth, when he would spend many a summer hour buried between the pages of ""Richie Rich,"" ""Casper,"" and ""G.I. Joe"" comics.

The Initial Titles

So that’s great and all, that we all love comics and have a solid team to develop them, but what are the titles that D.P.M. wants to initially release?Great question! Here they are:
 
The Lion Kings of Arthan ascended to the thrown as the Age of Dragons came to its end, and the Realm has known only peace under their reign for more than 500 years. But the village of Gaalreth has been cursed and the old darkness is returning once more to bring chaos to the Realm. As that darkness dawns anew, brothers descended of legend and long separated by leagues and loyalties must reunite to save the Realm.
12 issues written so far! 
 












A great threat encroaches on the galaxy—a threat that even the mighty Continuum cannot stop. Once cast aside, The Frontiersmen have assembled anew to face that threat, but the lines between friends and foes have blurred. Priorities have changed and loyalties have shifted. Yet, if the galaxy is to survive, there exists but one single hope. The Return of the Frontiersmen.


             
Harrington Cybernetics Corporation has designed and manufactured artificial limbs and organs for decades. Under second-generation President and CEO Justin Harrington, a man known for his love of excess as well as for his billionaire status, the company’s young biotronics division strives to become the first entity ever to successfully design and manufacture fully-functional and autonomous androids. Unfortunately, that achievement has proven more difficult to realize than they had hoped. But now Justin’s older brother, Penn State University Archaeologist Professor Walter Harrington, has discovered something that could change the family company’s fortunes forever, as well as that of the entire world.
27 issues written so far!

 
 


 


In every choice, there is a path. Dragon Phoenix Media present “Pathways,” a 24-issue miniseries leading into “The Return of the Frontiersmen.” The Frontiersmen were once Earth’s greatest heroes. They saved the world, and the world cast them aside. Now, as Emperor Oby’Dar of the Continuum faces his greatest challenge and a powerful villain pursues aspirations of worldwide economic domination, something even more sinister is coming…







These are the tales of the Frontiersmen. These are their Pathways.







In every choice, there is a path.
4 issues completed!
3 more inked in! 11 penciled and all 24 have been written! 
Previews coming!




When humans first set foot on Mars and discover ancient alien technology buried there, That discovery sets off a colonization push that centuries later transforms Mars into an independent world, free of the Earth government's shackles. Now bitter enemies, Mars and Earth fight an ongoing and devastating war for control of the red planet, believing there may exist there more alien technology yet to be discovered. A shocking discovery not only proves both sides wrong, but also warns that mankind may have awakened a power that neither side is ready to understand, let alone control.
4 issues written so far!

So What Do We Need?

As we said earlier, some of the work to get these titles published has already been done. Our goal is to have at least six issues of each title completely done by launch day. Much of the stories have already been written. Some issues have been drawn, some have been inked, and some have even been colored and just await lettering. Others still need a lot of art work done to finish them off. 
We are seeking $25,000 to reach our a goal of 5 titles each with 6 issues completed. Your donations will be spent in the following manner:

Hiring of 3 or more contract artist to pencil and ink issues.

Develop a distribution platform for digital delivery on PC, MAC, Android & iOS

Cover some of the costs already incurred to get this far.
Purchase art supplies, like paper, pens, ink, and tissues for when it all goes wrong (just kidding about the tissues).
Purchase some software for digital manipulation of images.
Perform some upfront advertising of the comics.
Pay for some of the thank you gifts.
Do a limited run of printed versions of the titles. 


Other Ways You Can Help!
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help.

Are you a talented artist? We're looking for people who can create sequential art and want to make a name for themselves in the comics business, Please contact us if you're interested.

Please share this campaign link with your social media connections.
Look for future updates that will include a FREE download of a mini-comic that you can enjoy and share.

<h3>Hello! </h3>
<p>In case you don't already know me I'm Laurel, I'm an illustrator and I live in England, and a couple of years ago I went to Iceland with my triplet brother and sister. During those few weeks I documented our time there through sketches, photographs, comics and in writing. Those documentations eventually became this book! </p>
<p>Ever since I had first seen the music video for Glósóli by Sigur Rós (years and years ago!) I had wanted to visit Iceland and its terrific and alien landscapes. You should watch/listen to that video if you want an idea of how it felt to be in Iceland.</p>

<div><div> </div></div>
<div>I wanted to capture every moment we explored with a hungry fervour. The cold but clean, sulphurous air, the amazing collection of geographical wonders in ONE place and the magic that seemed to imbue itself in the land and inspire those that live there through their folklore and literature. </div>
<div> </div>
<p>This campaign is for those of you who want to have a copy of this book! Unfortunately the cost for printing is very high and so I hope to use this as a way for you to pre-order your own copy! If we reach the goal it would be amazing! You would be helping me to print lots of copies of this book that will then be distributed around the world! I really want to share this experience that I had with my family because I learnt and saw so much and I want others to experience this too.  </p>

<h2><strong>The Story:</strong></h2>
<p>An international, government-approved drug company has been secretly conducting random trials on the general public for over 80 years.<br/>Just recently, some of those trials have produced alarming results - and this comic will document the panic and confusion as it unfolds.</p>
<p>Issue 1 of Random Trials will start the tale by focusing on Charlie Cooper, a very unlikely hero.  This balding, middle-aged rocker lives in a high crime area whose water supply has secretly been laced with a mild sedative (to see if it would calm the boisterous population).  The thing is, Charlie hasn't reacted well to the sedative - and world is about to meet a very dangerous (yet thoroughly loveable) man.</p>
<h2>The writer &amp; artist:</h2>
</div>
<div>That's me! I have written the first issue of the comic book and will be illustrating it all myself.  I am a professional illustrator whose work has been featured in several published comics including the Image Comics title 'No Place Like Home' and Terminal Press' zombie anthology - 'Zombiebomb!' </div>
<h2><strong>How I draw &amp; when I'll be finished:</strong></h2>
<div>My art techniques are quite laborious and involved.  I colour everything using acrylic paints and colouring pencils - before scanning into photoshop and tweaking with colour treatments.  Because of this, I expect this entire project (Issue 1 = 24 sequential pages + splash pages and info pages) to take AT LEAST 3 months for me to complete.  I really want to get issue 1 ready for distribution at all of the Comic Cons that will be happening across the UK in 2013 - so I'll be making every effort to work as fast as I can (without jeopardizing the quality of the pages).  I will make regular updates on this board.</div>
<h2><strong>Why am I doing this?:</strong></h2>
<div>I've been collecting comics for 25 years - and I've always dreamed of having my own title.  I believe that I have a great story to tell - as well as the artistic skills to make a beautiful looking book.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are tons of weird and unusual characters bouncing around in my imagination - and this book will give me the chance to start letting them escape onto the printed page.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Any contribution you make will help me to achieve my goal - and, hopefully, take me a step closer to becoming a name in the comic book industry.</div>
<h2><strong>What you'll get if you contribute:</strong></h2>
<div>I've included a wide range of contribution amounts - from $5 through to $200.  Perks include PDFs, signed copies of the book, original artwork and even the chance to see yourself as a character in issue 1!! </div>
<h2><strong>What am I doing with your money?:<br/></strong></h2>

<p>If you are unable to contribute towards this project, I would be very grateful for any exposure you could give me.  Sharing the link to this campaign on Twitter, Tumbler, Facebook and other social networking sites would be very kind of you.</p>

<p>This comic book will be for mature readers only.  It is set against the background of a London housing estate - and the bad langauge and violence it contains is reflective of that fact.</p>
</div></div>","The Story:
An international, government-approved drug company has been secretly conducting random trials on the general public for over 80 years.Just recently, some of those trials have produced alarming results - and this comic will document the panic and confusion as it unfolds.
Issue 1 of Random Trials will start the tale by focusing on Charlie Cooper, a very unlikely hero.  This balding, middle-aged rocker lives in a high crime area whose water supply has secretly been laced with a mild sedative (to see if it would calm the boisterous population).  The thing is, Charlie hasn't reacted well to the sedative - and world is about to meet a very dangerous (yet thoroughly loveable) man.
The writer & artist:

That's me! I have written the first issue of the comic book and will be illustrating it all myself.  I am a professional illustrator whose work has been featured in several published comics including the Image Comics title 'No Place Like Home' and Terminal Press' zombie anthology - 'Zombiebomb!' 
How I draw & when I'll be finished:
My art techniques are quite laborious and involved.  I colour everything using acrylic paints and colouring pencils - before scanning into photoshop and tweaking with colour treatments.  Because of this, I expect this entire project (Issue 1 = 24 sequential pages + splash pages and info pages) to take AT LEAST 3 months for me to complete.  I really want to get issue 1 ready for distribution at all of the Comic Cons that will be happening across the UK in 2013 - so I'll be making every effort to work as fast as I can (without jeopardizing the quality of the pages).  I will make regular updates on this board.
Why am I doing this?:
I've been collecting comics for 25 years - and I've always dreamed of having my own title.  I believe that I have a great story to tell - as well as the artistic skills to make a beautiful looking book.
 
There are tons of weird and unusual characters bouncing around in my imagination - and this book will give me the chance to start letting them escape onto the printed page.
 
Any contribution you make will help me to achieve my goal - and, hopefully, take me a step closer to becoming a name in the comic book industry.
What you'll get if you contribute:
I've included a wide range of contribution amounts - from $5 through to $200.  Perks include PDFs, signed copies of the book, original artwork and even the chance to see yourself as a character in issue 1!! 
What am I doing with your money?:
The funds I receive via indiegogo will go towards the cost of producing issue 1 of this comic book title.  That will include printing costs, art materials (paints, art pads etc), any fees given to other artists who contribute splash pages and the cost of a letterer.
Flexible Funding:
I will go ahead with this project whether I receive my entire funding target or not.  It should be noted, however, that my progress with the project is likely to be slowed down by any lack of interest from funders.

If you are unable to contribute towards this project, I would be very grateful for any exposure you could give me.  Sharing the link to this campaign on Twitter, Tumbler, Facebook and other social networking sites would be very kind of you.

<p>Greetings Indigogo! </p>
<p>I guess this is where I introduce myself, my
name is Ben Lee, and I am an artist and founder of Big Head Productions. And
I’m here to ask for your help and support for a comic that’s been a labor of
love of mine for, what seems like, forever. </p>
<p>That comic? LOST IN THE MIDDLE. Writing and
drawing this story had become more and more important for me to tell. How this
came about, well… one job I had in my cube farm career, I had one supervisor, a
real “good ‘ol boy” vibe, well, I remember one day he just asked me if my
parents owned a dry cleaners. Me, being Korean, the implication being that
Asians typically own businesses like a dry cleaners. </p>
<p>Safe to say, I was beyond angry. But I could
see the ignorance in his expression, and I couldn’t help but think he meant no
offense. So in true “Model Minority” fashion, I shined it on. </p>
<p>But as started writing this story, the
protagonist responds more violently, and ultimately finds himself in therapy.
From there, the comic became a very introspective story, as the struggles the
protagonist faced were deeper than beating up his boss. And suddenly I became
really invested in what kind of narrative I could tell that happens over the
course of a conversation. And the result has been really fulfilling, and it’s a
result I would love to share with the world. </p>
Which brings me here, to you.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Well, what do I need? Well, approximately
$5000. Now how will that be put to use? It’s a simple breakdown:</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>printing</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>marketing and advertising</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>perk fulfillment</p>
<p>Now I mentioned, “perk fulfillment”. I don’t
expect anything for free, and I want to give you a little love for your
support. Stuff I have outlined is copies of the comic, signed copies of the
comic. I’m planning a variant cover, exclusive to this campaign, to offer as a
perk. Original art from the comic, and so much more. </p>
<p>And I know there’s no reason why you should
know this, but I love sending snail mail, and care packages, so I’ll definitely
try and throw a little extra in there to with every perk level. :)</p>
<p>Now, if you’re asking what happens if I don’t
reach my goal here? Well, that’s one of the reasons I chose Indigogo over other
crowd funding platforms, because there’s the ability to receive all funds
raised, even if you don’t reach the goal. Now, where will that money go if I
don’t reach my goal? Simply, printing. And I’ll figure the rest out. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Well, the impact your support will have will
change my life. And that’s no lip service. Like so many others who want to make
comics, this is been something that I’ve wanted to do since I was a kid. Now at
38 years old, I’m all in, and chasing that dream. See, I don’t recall what the
proverbial straw was that broke my back at my last job. But last year, I
realized between my savings and my freelance, whatever frustration I was having
in my office job, I didn’t have to. </p>
<p>So I resigned. I incorporated a company. And
I’ve been working to build this thing ever since. </p>
<p>So when I say the impact your support will
bring is that it will change my life. I’m not kidding. You’re supporting my
dream, and I can’t thank you enough for that. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The big risk and challenge, aside from
fundraising, is getting the book out there. There’s only one distributor for
the Direct Market, and there’s always the possibility the book won’t be
accepted into their catalog. </p>
<p>But that’s okay. I’m willing to rise the
challenge. See that’s one of the reasons I chose to do this myself. See, doing
this myself affords me the freedom to chose my own printer, and if need be, my
own distribution. And for that, I definitely want to give that business to,
well, local business. And who doesn’t want to support their local economy,
right?</p>
<p>So if I can’t get into the distributor
catalog, I do have a plan to get the book out with a local fulfillment house.
It’ll be huge challenge, and a steep learning curve. But, this thing already
is. And if it wasn’t it wouldn’t be worth doing. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>Whether or not you back this project, and if
you do, thank you SO MUCH. But again, whether or not you back this project, if
you find it worthwhile, it would mean so much if you can share this campaign
with your friends &amp; family. Be social media, email, or even word of
mouth.  Every little bit helps. </p>

so much for your time. And I hope you’ll see this book in your local comic shop

<h3>The Comic</h3>
<p>Max Overacts is my webcomic I've been updating for over a year now. The comic centres around the life of Max Fogherty, an emerging <i>serious</i> thespian at the age of 8. It was <b>nominated for a</b> <b>2011 Eisner Award</b>, but lost, rightly, to Charles Christopher. The comic has a larger story developing underneath the daily gags, and the characters will age, go through changes, make big decisions, and have big things happen to them whether they like it or not. <b>""Volume One: Hold On To Your Stubs""</b> sets us on that journey.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you've found your way here but never read the comic, please visit <a href=""http://occasionalcomics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""See Max Act"">occasionalcomics.com</a> and have a read! If you were a fan of Calvin and Hobbes, you may like it. Some people may say it's too similar and I'm just a pale imitation, but to those I say ""read more than 5 strips! You'll see...""</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div><h3>The Book</h3></div><div>
<p>My initial quote (Which is almost the entire fundraising goal, plus some to allow for postage) is for 3000 copies of a 164 page full colour book at 8 x 10 inches. That's only slightly smaller than the original artwork so the details will shine through! If we only make it halfway to the goal, that's still good enough for 1000 copies, so everyone will get their orders. Please don't be afraid of that huge goal! I'm not!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The book will collect the first 142 strips plus 12 exclusive strips not seen on the web, focusing on Max's sister, Andromeda. See Andi at work, meet some of Andi's band mates, and even witness the moment Jacob fell for her and she didn't even notice him.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Plus, there will be an extra two strips if some daring fans step up to the 500 dollar plate, to have themselves put into an <i>actual</i> strip in <i>this</i> book itself, interacting with Max, Janet, Andi, Klaus, etc. Two awesome readers will be immortalized in book form for the ages! YOU will be on people's shelves. In libraries! Beside home lavatories! YOU, yes YOU, may eventually be... in a dollar bin! *gasp* Plus... you'll get to hang the original in your house. ;)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>What if you go over your goal?</b></h3>
<p>If the funding goes over, I will most likely print more books, and if it goes WAY over, well... I have lots of ideas for my business, Occasional Comics. I may hire other artists at a good page rate to illustrate side stories of the Max universe (Auryn in Alaska!) if the money comes rolling in. Or, well.. and this is a big pipe dream, I have spent far too long not being paid for what I do, and I know I'm not the only one, so I would love to be in a position one day when I can pay others for their work. To help produce other high quality all ages material that reap maximum profits for the creators. To pay them straight away, and not an arbitrary 30/60/half year waiting period. Lots of BIG ideals. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Most likely it will be for extra books though, and possibly extra rewards like Max enviro-bags, buttons, vinyl stickers, etc. Surprise gifts for surprisingly awesome fans. But, oh man... BIG ideals... :D</p>

</div><div><h3>Can we help?</h3></div><div>It's a big goal - don't be scared!

<p>Inspired by actual events* as well as beloved novels and films such as <i>Stand By Me</i> and <i>The Stepford Wives</i>, <strong>ELECTRIC YOUTH </strong>is a two issue, 56 page, full color, coming of age comic thriller that features the creative talents of Kyle Roberts, Clay Adams (Fried Comics), Rafael Dantas (Action Lab Comics) and Emilio Pilliu (ZZZ Comics) </p>
<h2>THE STORY</h2>
<p>Ever feel like you weren't the kid your parents wanted you to be? Jeff Eckard does. And when he and his dad move to Irvine, California in the Fall of 1989, things only get worse. Because almost all the kids in this boring-ass town seem gut-churningly perfect. So when Jeff and his friends go dumpster diving behind the local Quickie Mart, they’re just looking for a little...stimulation? Instead, Jeff finds a dead body.</p>
<p>Only, no one believes him. Not his friends, not his dad, no one. It’s up to Jeff to get the evidence himself, but his investigation uncovers an even more horrifying secret...</p>

<p>Following the success of ELECTRIC YOUTH's  first campaign we happened to catch the attention of our small local paper that ran a feature in its Sunday edition. Not only that, the story ended up being the second most read article of the weekend!</p>

<p>The added exposure led us to doubling our sales after the campaign and even yielded a few Hollywood inquiries before COVID-19 put the world on hiatus. We're hoping a strong campaign for the second issue will get those producers' attention once again!</p>

<p>Way back in 1989, at the age of 14, I moved from a small town outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to the burgeoning master planned community of Irvine, California. To call it a culture shock would be an understatement. Those first few weeks were a tough transition, but my circumstances changed for the better when I fell in with a trio guys; Matt, James and Jon...</p>

<p>Living in a town where there was so much to do, yet seemingly nowhere to do it, these guys made a big high school feel small and new town feel like home. James was always the ringleader of the group, constantly walking a fine line between brash and gregarious. After college he was the touchstone through which the four of us reconnected. Our friendship grew as we transitioned into adulthood, each of us settling into careers and families, whilst always staying present in each others lives. As close as we all were, each of us considered James our best friend. Which is why we all were so devastated when he was diagnosed with ALS at the age 32. Within a few short years the disease ravaged his body and robbed him of all motor function. Through it all James maintained his dignity, his sense of humor and his ability to bring us all together. One of those last times, the four of us spent an evening (and a couple of bottles of bourbon) reminiscing about our high school shenanigans - as sad as the circumstances were, it was a truly joyous experience. And from that night and those stories the seeds to this comic were planted. The dumpster event, minus the dead body, actually happened (although I won't say who exactly participated in that one). The characters within Electric Youth are an amalgamation of the four us, although Jon was the premier athlete and Matt was the kid who had to take his math classes at the junior college. They were, and are, the best friends anyone could ever ask for - and this comic, in a way, gives me the opportunity to continue to celebrate those relationships...and also provide you with a fun and thrilling story at the same time!</p>

</div></div>","Inspired by actual events* as well as beloved novels and films such as Stand By Me and The Stepford Wives, ELECTRIC YOUTH is a two issue, 56 page, full color, coming of age comic thriller that features the creative talents of Kyle Roberts, Clay Adams (Fried Comics), Rafael Dantas (Action Lab Comics) and Emilio Pilliu (ZZZ Comics) 
THE STORY
Ever feel like you weren't the kid your parents wanted you to be? Jeff Eckard does. And when he and his dad move to Irvine, California in the Fall of 1989, things only get worse. Because almost all the kids in this boring-ass town seem gut-churningly perfect. So when Jeff and his friends go dumpster diving behind the local Quickie Mart, they’re just looking for a little...stimulation? Instead, Jeff finds a dead body.
Only, no one believes him. Not his friends, not his dad, no one. It’s up to Jeff to get the evidence himself, but his investigation uncovers an even more horrifying secret...
PREVIEW
New backers - don't feel left out! You can sample 16 pages of issue #1 by clicking the image below and you can see first-hand how our last campaign went down -HERE-!

Without spoiling too much of the story, our next installment picks up right where we left Jeff and Danny at the cliffhanger conclusion of the first issue!

BUZZ FROM THE FIRST ISSUE!

Following the success of ELECTRIC YOUTH's  first campaign we happened to catch the attention of our small local paper that ran a feature in its Sunday edition. Not only that, the story ended up being the second most read article of the weekend!

The added exposure led us to doubling our sales after the campaign and even yielded a few Hollywood inquiries before COVID-19 put the world on hiatus. We're hoping a strong campaign for the second issue will get those producers' attention once again!
Comic speculators take notice!

The group was founded in 2010 by former US Army Staff Sergeant Thom Tran, who retired from the military after he was wounded in combat in Iraq in 2005. He ""enlisted"" US Air Force Major Jose Sarduy (still an active reservist), former USMC Sergeant Will C, and former US Army Private First Class Tom Irwin to form the group.</p>
<p>Since this comedic ""Troupe of Troops"" started they have toured all over the United States on military bases and comedy clubs from New Jersey to Kentucky to San Diego. Now on the Fall leg of their 2012 Tour, the GIs of Comedy plan to film a 2+ hour comedy special for DVD and BROADCAST on a MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORK, AND TO GET TO TROOPS OVERSEAS SO THEY CAN SHARE THE LAUGHTER WITH THE MEN &amp; WOMEN IN UNIFORM!</p>
<p>Does this sound ambitious? Heck yeah. Isn't everybody and their brother trying to ""make a DVD""? Yup. But here's why we're SURE we can make all of this happen:</p>
<p>1) Our Executive Producers are Ben Garant &amp; Tom Lennon, the creators and stars of Comedy Central's ""Reno! 911"" (they play Junior &amp; Dangle!), and the writers of the ""Night at the Museum"" franchise.</p>
<p>2) Ben &amp; Tom have walked the tour's creator, Thom Tran into Comedy Central HQ to meet with the heads of the network who have shown GREAT interest in the project.</p>
<p>3) We already have an established production company ready to shoot the special!</p>
<p>4) We're ON TOUR RIGHT NOW! And have a deal worked out with a nearly 1,500 seat venue to film the special in November!</p>
<p>5) We are Armed Forces Entertainment approved artists and are currently touring over a dozen US Army Posts performing for troops all across the country!</p>
<p>6) We have the support of the former head of the Los Angeles USO who we've performed for many times, and military troops and commanders all over the country!</p>
<p>7) We've performed for SEAL Team 5 who again came out to support the tour at our recent show in San Diego.</p>
<p>8) The CBS Early Show, CNN, Fox News, and the Associated Press have all shown so much interest in the tour they've done stories about us! (You can see them all on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/gisofcomedy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.youtube.com/gisofcomedy</a>)</p>
<p>9) EVERYONE is supporting our troops, from Hollywood to Budweiser to General Motors.</p>
<p>10) Being based in Hollywood, we have the connections to THE movers and shakers in the Entertainment industry to make this happen!</p>
<p>So now we're asking YOU to help make this DVD and Television Special a reality, and YOU get to be a part of it! By helping fund our Kickstarter you'll have the opportunity to have your name listed in the credits as a contributor (see you name on TV and the DVD!), get an autographed copy of the DVD, be listed as a Producer (in title) on the projects, AND you'll be helping bring some laughter to the men and women who serve our country in uniform!</p>
<p>As for the ""delivery date"" of August, 2013... why so far out? Here's the plan...</p>
<p>- November 2012 - FILMING! We shoot the special in New London, CT (2 days of pre-production on site, 1 day of filming, 2 days of post/ pickups)</p>
<p>- January 2013 - EDITING! Since we're on tour until the middle of December, we'll be getting additional footage through the end of the tour, and then the holidays are immediately after, post-production and editing won't really start until the New Year. Editing will take between 6-7 weeks, as we're going to be taking footage from 5 months of the road, plus the actual show footage for the DVD</p>
<p>- Feb/ May 2013 - BATTER UP! We've been pitching the special to Networks for months now, and there's some serious interest. It's getting the special DONE which is the crazy part about Hollywood. But we have some heavy hitters on our side!</p>
<p>- July 4th, 2013 - LET MAKE IT HAPPEN! We've been wanting to get this filmed and aired on the 4th of July on whatever network will have us, so this is the air date we're shooting for!</p>
<p>- August 2013 - DVD SHIPPED.

<p>Because this is a time sensitive project I am limiting it to indigogo supporters. I will not be mass producing this calendar so get it while you can :)</p>
<p>So here is the detail of what the funds will be used for...</p>
<p>1) Printing and shipping to you.</p>
<p>2) Extra fun bonus prints, banners, Polaroids, etc.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to bring you this 13 month full color full glossy calendar I need your first born child, a large cauldron, a broom, and a full moon. Oh wait, that's something different... for this I just need some awesome cosplay and art fans to choose the perk they love the best and share this with others on social media. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The benefits of funding this project are huge! My first and second Photobook were the first of their kind and were wildly successful. So now I bring you the AzPowergirl 2017 Calendar! One of my biggest goals is championing cosplay and adding to its legitimacy as a valid art form. I feel that this project will help to advance this cause. </p>
<p>As the proverb goes, you vote with your wallet. If you want cosplay, support it and more of it will come!</p>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've taken on a substantial investment by curating images, building the calendar and finding good printing. This is on top of the time and effort of having built the costumes, shooting with the photographers and editing the images. I always like to support my friends in this industry so I am using printers and photographers who are cosplay friendly and supportive of the community.</p>

</div></div>","alcheringa (in the mythology of some Australian Aboriginals) the 'golden age' when the first ancestors were created. It is also called the Dreamtime. The word comes (in the late 19th century) from the Aboriginal language Arrernte, and means 'in the Dreamtime'.Alcheringa is a multimedia comic about a young woman named Madelyn who is troubled by reoccurring nightmares. It isn't until Madelyn enters the Dream World that she soon discovers what her true purpose is, in a realm polluted by nightmares. The team of Alcheringa consists of a variety of artists ranging from illustrators, colorists, inkers, musicians, djs, writers, photographers, models, designers, jewelers, and creative consultants. Together we work to create a complex and unique world that we hope will engage our readers. 




The comic upon completion will consist of the story, a photograph of Madelyn, and both an Alcheringa mix and music created to fit the story of the comic. The soundtrack will be directly linked to our website. We are all very excited about this project and we can't wait to share the world of Alcheringa with you.

quite a few stretch goals to hit as well.</span></p>Lots of people have asked why we are trying to crowd-source this year if we've been able to successfully run the event by charging admission in the past. We figured that this would be a worthwhile experiment as we would like to make anime conventions more accessible to the masses. We have all been down the road where you spent all your money to get to a convention and not had any left over to purchase things from artists or dealers (let alone eat).  This way those who can afford to go can ""pay it forward"" to those who might not be able to.   Another reason for this experiment is more of a practical one.  As some of you may not know, our main two convention coordinators have lives outside of the convention world.  They both have jobs and families that suffer so that you can enjoy all that convention goodness.  Well, sometimes life can be a cruel mistress, and can put a damper on all our convention fun. One has had to move across our fair state to stay employed while the other has been battling a plague of health problems, as well as caring for family that is sick.  On top of all of this, we lost our main transaction processor, so we thought ""What the hey, lets try something new!""<p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/307259/files/20140113233206-rewards.jpg?1389684726"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>When we make our goal, you may ask: ""How will registration work?"" This is a very good question.  As ""free"" events tend to draw a crowd, we will be capping convention attendance at 3,000.  Those who donate at a level which says confirmed entry or are Foundation Level or higher, will be able to enter with no fear of being stopped (e.g. think pre-reg in a normal convention experience.)  Those who have already bought a ticket from us at an early convention will be counted at the ""Thanks w/ Confirmed Entry"" level (you lucky dog!) Children 12 and under are always free if their guardian has a member badge.  Everyone else will line up first come/first serve at registration, except no money will change hands, you tell use you want in, and we give you a badge; one badge per person.  As per policy, memberships can be revoked from those who do not follow posted rules. Remember that at 1:30 pm the day of the convention all unclaimed Confirmed Entry badges turn into pumpkins....er.....get distributed to the general public.</p><p></p><p>Say however we don't make our goal, but all will not be lost, the convention will go as planned. <b>This is a Flexible Funding fund type which means we will keep the funds we raise, even if our goal is not reached.

<p></p></div>","Mizuumi-Con is a one-day family-friendly anime, gaming, and Japanese culture convention presented by OLLU’s Mizuumi Anime Club, a Recognized Student Organization at Our Lady of the Lake University.  We have educational presentations, cosplay contests, video gaming, voice actors, Video rooms, dealer/artist ally, as well as food booths and other entertainment. ZDA (aka Mizuumi-Con 1) was presented
as a partnership between OLLU's anime club and San Japan. The same was true for Mizuumi-Con 2 . Mizuumi-Con 3 was run entirely by OLLU students,
faculty, staff, and alumni on a shoe-string  budget. We have had pretty steady growth
over all these years. ZDA's attendance was 930 with Mizuumi-Con 6 attendance ballooning to 2,415. All the funds collected will go into running this year's convention. Our primary goal is to raise enough to give everyone free admission to the event! We believe we can do this if we hit the $20k mark.  Past our $20k mark we have
quite a few stretch goals to hit as well.Lots of people have asked why we are trying to crowd-source this year if we've been able to successfully run the event by charging admission in the past. We figured that this would be a worthwhile experiment as we would like to make anime conventions more accessible to the masses. We have all been down the road where you spent all your money to get to a convention and not had any left over to purchase things from artists or dealers (let alone eat).  This way those who can afford to go can ""pay it forward"" to those who might not be able to.   Another reason for this experiment is more of a practical one.  As some of you may not know, our main two convention coordinators have lives outside of the convention world.  They both have jobs and families that suffer so that you can enjoy all that convention goodness.  Well, sometimes life can be a cruel mistress, and can put a damper on all our convention fun. One has had to move across our fair state to stay employed while the other has been battling a plague of health problems, as well as caring for family that is sick.  On top of all of this, we lost our main transaction processor, so we thought ""What the hey, lets try something new!""When we make our goal, you may ask: ""How will registration work?"" This is a very good question.  As ""free"" events tend to draw a crowd, we will be capping convention attendance at 3,000.  Those who donate at a level which says confirmed entry or are Foundation Level or higher, will be able to enter with no fear of being stopped (e.g. think pre-reg in a normal convention experience.)  Those who have already bought a ticket from us at an early convention will be counted at the ""Thanks w/ Confirmed Entry"" level (you lucky dog!) Children 12 and under are always free if their guardian has a member badge.  Everyone else will line up first come/first serve at registration, except no money will change hands, you tell use you want in, and we give you a badge; one badge per person.  As per policy, memberships can be revoked from those who do not follow posted rules. Remember that at 1:30 pm the day of the convention all unclaimed Confirmed Entry badges turn into pumpkins....er.....get distributed to the general public.Say however we don't make our goal, but all will not be lost, the convention will go as planned. This is a Flexible Funding fund type which means we will keep the funds we raise, even if our goal is not reached. If the goal is not reached, we will still honor all perks; which translates into those who donated at a confirmed entry level, you just got a pre-reg (with whatever swag that comes with said level), and we will charge our normal fee at the door to those that did not donate.  If you are a vendor or artist please do not donate unless you really want to.  We will not honor those who say they donated wanting a ""free"" table if we don't meet that stretch goal. To get any table at the convention you must go through our table confirmation process that will go live January 15th on the official convention website.

<p><b>PUBLISHER</b></p>
<p></p><p>Negotiations
 have just completed for one of the largest publishers in the world to 
print and distribute the finished, remastered book. 
 Once the remastered book is delivered to the publisher, they will get 
it into as many sales outlets as possible around the world. But a 
tremendous amount of work must be done before that can happen.</p><p>The real work is only just beginning … and this is where your help will be so necessary. At the time <b><i>Breathtaker</i></b> was
 originally published, graphics computers were the size of a car and
 very expensive – way beyond the budget for this graphic novel.
 So Mark painted the pages in watercolor and gouache on ⅛-inch thick 
board. The line art was transferred to giant film positives and an 
unholy art sandwich was sent to the color separator for printing.</p><p>The
 next step was absolutely horrific for any artist! When the separator 
got the color art boards, they had to strip the surface layer of paper 
from the board so that they could wrap it around a spinning drum 
scanner. That’s right – they were ripping the art boards, and stretching
 the paper in the
 process! The results were okay to good, but
 never perfect. And in the years since, the paper and the film have 
changed sizes so that they do not match today. The pages are being 
carefully re-scanned and will be digitally manipulated to finally get a 
perfect marriage of the line art and painted color. In a number of cases
 the art is being retouched by Mark Wheatley, to remove damage and dirt,
 and even – in a few frightening instances – repair pages that were torn
 in half when the original color separator wrapped it around that 
scanning drum! The remastered <b><i>Breathtaker</i></b> will
 finally present the art as it was always intended. Nearly as much time 
is being invested in this process as it took to create the work in the 
first place! But it is worth the effort to finally get it right.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/209200/files/20131119092009-BREATHTAKER-BG-PITCH34.jpg?1384881609"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Marc and Mark always reach for higher and higher goals with each new project; remastering <b><i>Breathtaker </i></b>is

<p></p><p>While the core material for <b><i>Breathtaker Remastered</i></b> already
 exists, the restoration work is nearly as demanding as the original

 of an artist to get the work done. None of this is all that risky, as 
long as the artists, Marc Hempel and Mark Wheatley, are healthy and able
 to take the time to do this
 work as it should be done. Mike Gold, editor for the original series 
and a producer on the sequel has said, “There are plenty of comics pros 
who wish Mark would slow down. He turns out great work and doesn’t worry
 editors about missed deadlines.”</p><p>The
 publisher will get the finished book about 6 months after the closing 
of this fundraiser, if our goals are met. The solicitation cycle for a 
book to reach market is about 12 months; that’s where we get our 
estimate of 14-18 months for
 publication.</p>If any unforeseen issues should arise, we will keep donors informed of any and all changes in our production timeline.<br/><p></p>     <br/><p></p></div>","Breathtaker

a new generation of readers. He has written for TV, illustrated books, designed
cutting-edge role-playing games, hosted a weekly radio program, and was an
early innovator of the online, daily comic strip form.
Your perks will be exceptional! Please read the rewards list closely, as we are
 piling on the benefits and would hate for you to miss out on
 anything. If you help us to go beyond our goal, every additional dollar will go toward value added features for the remastered Breathtaker, including additional pages of material. If we reach our stretch goal, Mark and Marc will create the long asked for The Man™comic book story that is talked about in the context of the Breathtaker graphic novel. But, also, they will forge ahead with the long-awaited Breathtaker sequel.
The incredible Breathtaker perks include :
The full
title of the original graphic novel is Breathtaker: Love, Death, Sex,
Power.
Over the years it has become shorthand to just call the book Breathtaker.
 But now it's important that you are aware of its full title, because 
the very first presentation Mark and Marc made to editor Mike Gold at DC
 Comics included the promise of a sequel … one that was planned to take 
place about 20 years later. No one ever imagined it might take over 20 
years to finally create that sequel. That’s right – once  Breathtaker Remastered is ready, Marc and Mark will begin work on the next Breathtaker story!SOURCE
MATERIAL 
Much of the original art for Breathtaker is
 retained in storage at Insight Studios. Also, art collectors are being 
asked for scans of the small
 number of pages that are in their hands. The hunt for missing original 
pages is ongoing. Please contact us if you have an original color page 
or know of collectors who have color Breathtaker pages.
PUBLISHER
Negotiations
 have just completed for one of the largest publishers in the world to 
print and distribute the finished, remastered book. 
 Once the remastered book is delivered to the publisher, they will get 
it into as many sales outlets as possible around the world. But a 
tremendous amount of work must be done before that can happen.The real work is only just beginning … and this is where your help will be so necessary. At the time Breathtaker was
 originally published, graphics computers were the size of a car and
 very expensive – way beyond the budget for this graphic novel.
 So Mark painted the pages in watercolor and gouache on ⅛-inch thick 
board. The line art was transferred to giant film positives and an 
unholy art sandwich was sent to the color separator for printing.The
 next step was absolutely horrific for any artist! When the separator 
got the color art boards, they had to strip the surface layer of paper 
from the board so that they could wrap it around a spinning drum 
scanner. That’s right – they were ripping the art boards, and stretching
 the paper in the
 process! The results were okay to good, but
 never perfect. And in the years since, the paper and the film have 
changed sizes so that they do not match today. The pages are being 
carefully re-scanned and will be digitally manipulated to finally get a 
perfect marriage of the line art and painted color. In a number of cases
 the art is being retouched by Mark Wheatley, to remove damage and dirt,
 and even – in a few frightening instances – repair pages that were torn
 in half when the original color separator wrapped it around that 
scanning drum! The remastered Breathtaker will
 finally present the art as it was always intended. Nearly as much time 
is being invested in this process as it took to create the work in the 
first place! But it is worth the effort to finally get it right.Marc and Mark always reach for higher and higher goals with each new project; remastering Breathtaker is
 no different. They intend for this book to be the very best it can be. 
They will include piles of the original script pages, development work, 
Marc’s pencils and line art, private commissions, marketing art, and 
other cool, behind-the-scenes material – even some new work!Once this campaign funds, production will begin on the remastering of the original Breathtaker. After commissions are out of the way, Marc and Mark will use any remaining funding to get started on the sequel.WHERE THE

GOAL - $60,000
The Man™ comic book story. Mark Wheatley and
Marc Hempel will create the actual overblown, Marvel-style The Man™
comic book that is shown as an object in the context of the original Breathtaker
graphic novel.
RISKS AND
CHALLENGES
While the core material for Breathtaker Remastered already
 exists, the restoration work is nearly as demanding as the original 
creation, and requires the eyes and hands
 of an artist to get the work done. None of this is all that risky, as 
long as the artists, Marc Hempel and Mark Wheatley, are healthy and able
 to take the time to do this
 work as it should be done. Mike Gold, editor for the original series 
and a producer on the sequel has said, “There are plenty of comics pros 
who wish Mark would slow down. He turns out great work and doesn’t worry
 editors about missed deadlines.”The
 publisher will get the finished book about 6 months after the closing 
of this fundraiser, if our goals are met. The solicitation cycle for a 
book to reach market is about 12 months; that’s where we get our 
estimate of 14-18 months for
 publication.If any unforeseen issues should arise, we will keep donors informed of any and all changes in our production timeline.",26.0,0,"8 Campaigns

<p>Chapter 3 is now in the works!</p></div>","Short Summary
 
I am a storyteller, through and through. I've been writing since I was at least 13, coming up with goofy little side-stories for videogames and anime. It wasn't until I got into college that the world of comic books became a reality and I hit the ground running. I thought ""I can use comics as a way to improve my art and storytelling and act as a stepping stone to, later, animating my work!""
 
    It's been an uphill struggle for ten years. Researching, drawing, writing, crying, heartache, anxiety, on the verge of giving up. But I never did and here I am at last. Finally good enough to produce and to make the vision of my life come true.
 
    It is a fervent wish of mine to be successful but not just for myself. I want to be successful so that it will serve as a vehicle of inspiration to all others who may have the desire to create entire worlds just from their imaginations.

What We Need & What You Get
 
Let's break down the numbers:
 

Ideally, $2500-3000 is what I'm aiming for. Most of this money will go to Technology updates and art instruction so that I can improve upon my art even faster. Once I acquire the necessary equipment, I will be working on an artbook with fan-contributed work amongst my own as well as the printing of the first few chapters. I will also be using some of these funds to build a website that will feature all of my other projects as well as 'Descendant'.
 

As a perk, I will be giving away free art and books as time progresses. Right now I have nothing to give back to you other than my solemn oath to work diligently.  D':
 

But I hope that doesn't stop you from helping! Believe me, if you give, I give in some way. As I gain popularity and funds are generated from my endeavours, I will be extending much in the way of community appreciation as I truly enjoy engaging my fans and friends. Everything from free merchandise to convention passes.
Not reaching my goal will not hinder my push forward. I will simply put the money aside until I am able to generate all of the necessary funds and beyond to keep my obligations to my friends and fans.
 
The Impact
 
Your contributions will do something personal for me. It will be the light at the end of this very long tunnel. The money generated will get me a few steps closer to getting out of food service and finally free to focus on my goals 100%. You will ALL be my official heroes.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 
Can't give money?
 
That's PERFECTLY fine. I accept art of my beloved characters, stories and, someday soon, I hope to be creating role playing sheets so I can see how well the mechanics of the characters and their classes/roles in my universe are understood.
 
I'm also looking for people to help me learn flash and to make my comic website look even better than it now by adding character designs, beastiary and a place for featured fanart and contests!
 
Just hitting the *tweet* button will help immensely!

<h3>The Story </h3> I'm Mike Wolfer, writer and artist of such
 horror comic classics as WIDOW, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, FRIDAY THE 
13TH, Brian Pulido's LADY DEATH and many more. I recently returned to my
 self-publishing roots with the formation of Mike Wolfer Entertainment, 
and have run several very successful Kickstarter campaigns to fund THE 
CURSE OF RAGDOLL, DAUGHTERS OF THE DARK ORACLE, and WIDOW ARCHIVES. 
However, Kickstarter does not allow material of an adult nature, so I've
 come to Indiegogo with my latest project because here, anything goes!<br/><br/> 
 Rissk made her first appearance in 1997's WIDOW #0. In 1999, publisher 
Avatar Press reprinted all of Widow's adventures leading up to WIDOW #0 
in the 14-issue, x-rated WIDOW X series, and I retconned those stories 
to contain new, adults-only scenes featuring Rissk. In May of this year,
 I ran a Kickstarter to reprint all of Widow's adventures in the 
four-volume WIDOW ARCHIVES, but because of Kickstarter's standards, I 
had to remove all of the x-rated material, including all scenes with 
Rissk, as well as her 12-page origin story that ran as a back-up feature
 in WIDOW X.<br/><br/>  And that's what you'll get in MAXIMUM RISSK- All 
of the material that was too hot for Kickstarter! MAXIMUM RISSK contains
 her 12-page origin story, as well as 8 story pages that were excised 
from WIDOW ARCHIVES, all strung together with new dialog to form a 
single narrative. <b>WARNING:</b> Because this material was created for a
 totally exploitative, x-rated comic, <b>THERE IS</b> <b>ABSOLUTELY NO REDEEMING, 
ARTISTIC MERIT TO ANY OF IT!</b> I'm not kidding. It's total, mindless 
filth, and strictly for adults only (XXX)! If you haven't been scared away by 
now, read on...!<br/><br/><div> <h3>The Goal </h3> MAXIMUM RISSK is a 24-page, black 
and white comic book, and is available in several different editions: 
Regular, Nude, and Sketch Cover Edition. But her story doesn't end 
there! You can also get Rissk's debut from WIDOW #0, repackaged as the 
48-page, black and white FANGS OF THE WIDOW ANNUAL, in an exclusive, 
Indiegogo Edition! This book was previously available for backers of the
 WIDOW ARCHIVES Kickstarter, but the Indiegogo Edition cover features 
new coloring and the Indiegogo logo to make it a unique collectible!<br/><br/> 
 My goal for this campaign is $1600 US, which will be enough to pay for 
the printing of all of the perks, and allow for an overprint of all 
editions so that I can sell them at conventions. But- AND THIS IS 
IMPORTANT- all backer perks will be SIGNED &amp; NUMBERED, with that 
numbering limited to the number of backers! Unlike other crowdfunded 
campaigns where you might have seen creators later selling the same 
backer perks at a discount, these signed &amp; numbered editions will 
NEVER be sold ANYWHERE- They are exclusive to Indiegogo and you! 
<br/> 

<div> <h3>The Perks (Rewards)<br/>
</h3>
<p>  The MAXIMUM RISSK campaign begins with the regular cover of the 24-page, black and white MAXIMUM RISSK, for a contribution of $15! This backer edition is autographed by Mike Wolfer, and is numbered, limited to the total number of backers only!<br/></p>
<p></p>

The cover coloring of this special Indiegogo Edition of the FANGS OF THE WIDOW ANNUAL varies from the Kickstarter edition- You could almost say they're like day and night!<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433353529/ndtmns6deirhrinoazpl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>  Next comes a very special variant cover, the nude edition of MAXIMUM RISSK! As with the previous covers, this is also signed and numbered, and limited to the number of backers. All three books can be yours for a contribution of only $45!<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433353651/mzwydncygfzhejwvnsma.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>  There's also an inked Sketch Cover edition at the $140 level!<br/><br/>  Next up are comic sets, featuring either my writing or art, or both! These sets all have limited quantities, so if you're a collector you'll need to act fast.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433354628/ntoijtzlqdnzequ82skp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

The most unique and one-of-a-kind rewards can be found at the next two levels!<br/>   At $250, you can get an original, inked, 11"" X 17"" commission of one character with minimal background of any comic or movie character of your liking (nudes are permissible)!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433354920/iqjwwa0bolgyp4vi9iew.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>  But the greatest bragging rights go to those who back the $350 level! With this level, you'll get an original art commission (comic cover quality) of any Mike Wolfer character.

I have met waitress Marina in a coffee bar, I think she asked me for a cigarette.  As a revenge, on the bar table, between the coffee cups, ashtrays and bags of sugar, she told me the most extraordinary story I have ever heard. True story but unbelievable, sad but powerful, from the past but so Hot. 
Marina was just drinking coffee with her friends, when the bloody war split on the table. The table was in Bosnia, Marina was the Serb and her friends were Muslims...
TragiComic about manipulation and propaganda, about  the Hate between former neighbours, about the civil War, about suffering and dying… but also about strong friendship and brave spirit, that cross all the contrasts and differences between any religions and cultures. 


Even after many years, the marks of War remains. Now is Marina working as a waitress and she serves us the menu of her war experiences - to remind us of the taste, before somebody orders the war on your table...




War Menu:""Documentary Photos from the Bosnia-Serb War""  feat  ""Coffee Table""







During this time I have met Marina, I was working as Photo Editor in a big and respectful newspaper, surrounded by documentary and famous photos. But in the news, we never presented the wars so truly boiling, how a veteran waitress laid it on the bar table! I’ve been told, that war is too bitter for the readers and the advertisers don't like the sad issues neither, because it kills the shopping mood.
Well, Peace is sweet, but - do we prefer sweet propaganda then real taste of Life? So i started to make the photos of the cups and sugar bags, drawing main sweet heroes of Marina story, searching the information on the net, looking for documentary photos from the Balkan war,... and making the collages between the sweet words and bitter world, between famous art and forgotten wars.
The whole comix is done, 6 chapters, 103 color pages + cover

 





Curious about more? You can see almost whole book for free! Check 5 chapters here!
... but you can not read it, right? :/ Well guys, the crazy text in the bubbles is not any bloody code, but czech, my native language. I do pretty speak english,...and it is a comic, so more visual then the text. But! The tiny line-language between appetite for War and taste for Life, the right proper words for sweet sugar and (still) sweet human spirit... 
Hell yeah, Metaphwar on the table needs professional poetic translation! 
To make the comic see the World, Im trying to collect money for great english translation & respectful hard-cover printed BOOK! Full colors, 103 pages... Printing is very expensive and keep the high quality I can run ""just"" for minimum 100 copies (so the BOOK will be much a limited edition ,-) , all books signed. 
Reaching the goal will cover the cost of: english translation, book printing run, freight costs to get the books to me, shipping the books and other goodies to you guys, and Indiegogo's cut of the raised funds.
How fundraising works:Yes, your donation helps! You can select as many perks as you want, corresponding to the amount you wish to donate. This means you're not only being awesome: you are also receiving sweet stuff as proof of that!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In the elite circles and hushed whispers around the planet, the world’s best and highest paid assassins are mentioned as myths.  But if you can afford their fee, the Hit Squad is available to handle your extermination needs.  A once in a lifetime opportunity presents itself when hitman extraordinaire Rico Brande is recruited by the mysterious Mistress Sinn to join the exclusive Hit Squad.  Given an “initiation job” with the Hit Squad, Brande learns the deadly secret behind the Hit Squad...one that they are willing to kill to protect!  What happens when the hunter becomes the hunted and goes up against the best of the best?  Find out in the pages of THE HIT SQUAD #0!</p>
<p>By picking up this book, you will be helping to bring the next issue, THE HIT SQUAD #1 to life.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With this being the follow up campaign to the recent COSMOS #1 book, I want to continue to introduce my comics to the Indiegogo Community and have chosen THE HIT SQUAD #0 the next to do so.  </p>
<p>Since the book is already completed, I am only asking for the minimum funding for two reasons: (1) I do not need funding to finish this book because it is already completed and (2) I really want to try to grow an Indiegogo following for our books.  I want EVERYONE we can get to make this campaign successful.  Don’t get me wrong, it would be awesome to get more than the minimum and succeed by getting the book into as many hands as possible (hopefully, we can make it happen) but I will be grateful to get new readers to the book.</p>
<p>We have a great book and some pretty cool rewards for you if you choose to back our campaign. We even have a pretty nifty Fanboy Action Boxed Set that is loaded with items and FIVE lucky backers will be able to walk away with our exclusive tenth anniversary Black Box Set!</p>
<p>If we achieve anything above our funding goal, that money will go directly into the creation of the upcoming THE HIT SQUAD #1.   </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Hit Squad are important characters within my comics universe and is why I wanted to introduce them first ahead of any of the heroes.  Why is that, you ask?!  Because everyone loves a great villain and we’ve got a whole group of them!  </p>
<p>This is my next book following the successful COSMOS Indiegogo campaign but by no means my first project like this.  I have produced several other campaigns on other platforms and want to continue to do so here on Indiegogo as well.</p>
<p> I hope that the Indiegogo Community will give THE HIT SQUAD #0 a try so that we can bring other great comics projects to the platform.  And I will make everyone who backs our campaigns a promise to always deliver them and to strive to give you some damn good comics &amp; items that are worth your hard earned cash!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks to this campaign are slim to none because the book is completed and just needs to be printed to meet the number of backers of this campaign who want it.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that some people won’t be able to back the campaign because of the holidays but you can still help by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking folks to get the word out and making some noise about the Hit Squad campaign.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools and SHARE, SHARE, SHARE!!</li>
</ul>
</div><p><br/>I hope that you will give THE HIT SQUAD #0 a try and back this book.  I thank you for taking the time out to look at this campaign and wish you a very Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays!</p></div>","Short Summary

If we achieve anything above our funding goal, that money will go directly into the creation of the upcoming THE HIT SQUAD #1.   
 

The Impact
The Hit Squad are important characters within my comics universe and is why I wanted to introduce them first ahead of any of the heroes.  Why is that, you ask?!  Because everyone loves a great villain and we’ve got a whole group of them!  
This is my next book following the successful COSMOS Indiegogo campaign but by no means my first project like this.  I have produced several other campaigns on other platforms and want to continue to do so here on Indiegogo as well.
 I hope that the Indiegogo Community will give THE HIT SQUAD #0 a try so that we can bring other great comics projects to the platform.  And I will make everyone who backs our campaigns a promise to always deliver them and to strive to give you some damn good comics & items that are worth your hard earned cash!
 

Risks & Challenges
The risks to this campaign are slim to none because the book is completed and just needs to be printed to meet the number of backers of this campaign who want it.  
 

Other Ways You Can Help
I know that some people won’t be able to back the campaign because of the holidays but you can still help by:

Asking folks to get the word out and making some noise about the Hit Squad campaign.
Use the Indiegogo share tools and SHARE, SHARE, SHARE!!

I hope that you will give THE HIT SQUAD #0 a try and back this book.  I thank you for taking the time out to look at this campaign and wish you a very Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays!",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

Hello, Comic Book lovers!
My name is Joseph Cillo Jr.  I'm the Creator and writer of Blind Prophet, the third in a series of screenplays I have written from a Roman Catholic perspective.
Blind Profit is the story of a blind, autistic savant who undergoes an experimental operation which gives him the ability to peer into the spirit world and see demons and angels vying for human souls.


Blind Prophet was originally conceived as a movie, and I still would like to pursue realizing the story on film.  But, it includes a lot of religious content that is important to me as the writer that might not survive the Hollywood editing process.  So, we are going to publish this as seven episodes of a comic book, then roll it all up in a single volume as a graphic novel.The entire series will be seven episodes:

A Prophet is Born
Spiritual Warfare
The Prophet Goes To Washington
The Great Demon of Pride
Sic Semper Tyrannis
Martial Law
The Better Angels Of Our Nature

Each episode will begin with an appropriate quote from the Bible or from a saint. Episode 1, for which this funding is directed, begins with:

Blind Prophet is not just an exciting story. It will make people think a little, about the sanctity of life, and the nature of temptation, and good and evil.  Here's an excerpt from a review of the screenplay:“There is an undeniable sense of originality about “Blind Prophet” that makes for a unique and intriguing reading experience…. a unique narrative unlike any other script in existence.”  BlueCat Screenplay Competition.We are looking to build a following and loyal fan base who will really love this work.  For that, I really do need your help...What We Need & What You GetI am funding the development costs myself and we are pretty much done with the artwork for episode one.

<p>Once there was a woman named <b>Astra
Crompton</b> who decided to share a story with the world. This story would be
told in words and pictures and colour. It would be given freely, a new page every
week, to the unfathomable depths of the internet. And it would be interactive,
giving options to its readers at the end of each chapter to encourage them to
direct the tone, relationships and content of the unfolding story. It would be
about pirates and gay romance and gritty issues of prejudice, violence, freedom
and morality. It would be called <b>Weaponry.</b></p>
<p>Weaponry can be found at <a href=""http://www.otherworldscomics.com/weaponry.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.otherworldscomics.com/OWC/</span></a> as well as
on DeviantART and Smackjeeves. Every Monday it has updated since 2011 when it first
launched. There have been two chapters printed so far: <b>Weaponry Academy</b>, and <b>A
Pirate’s Life for Me</b>. Both were the result of successful previous campaigns
here on Indiegogo. Now it’s time to launch Chapter 3 from its moorings to join
the growing Weaponry library...</p>
<p>Like the first two volumes, <b>Chapter
3: All Adrift...</b> will contain all of the comic pages from online (cleaned
up and reformatted for print). There will be exclusive bonus art and planning
sketches. The Crossbones vignettes for Blade and Gun will give glimpses to what
might have happened had the vote results been different. <b>Drumming Song</b> will comprise 20 pages of bonus comic about the backstory
for Grenade and Shield. All together it will be <b>86 pages of full colour</b> material in a glossy bound print edition. Chapter
1 (<a href=""http://otherworldscomics.bigcartel.com/product/weaponry-chapter-one-weaponry-academy"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>have a look

installment.</p>
<p>There is plenty more story to tell, and the next script has begun
already. With your help and support, Weaponry’s crew will continue sailing the
night, raiding unsuspecting ships, its pirates falling in love, battles ensuing
in bloody massacre under the searing heat, and one lucky pirate will earn the
right to the elusive Captain’s Seal... </p>

<p>With the help and suggestions of readers in the Forums, we have hammered

new loot!</p>
<p>You can, of course, simply pitch in a lump sum of money – but we are
offering a great number of exciting packages. So have a peruse to your right
and see if any of these levels excite your blood. Simply click on the one that
appeals the most, and note that some of them have limited numbers, so be sure
to grab them quickly before they’re all gone! </p>
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE</b> that some of the higher level
incentives have <b>OPTIONS</b>. Anywhere you

the other of this offered perk. <b>Please leave
a comment</b> with which one you select (or if you like to be clandestine, send
me an email) for my records. Also note that the highest tiers stack, which
means anything over the 80$ mark includes the perks from that tier and the
perks preceding it. Wow! That’s a lot of bang for your buck!</p>
<p>Since I'm the sole creator of this comic, I'm also the only one filling
the orders (including drawing the unique art and making your hand-crafted
prizes) so please have patience as I fill all of your orders. If you live <b>OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA</b> please include
an extra $10 in your donation to offset shipping costs. All parcels will be
sent <b>Canada Post Expedited</b>, or <b>International Small Packet Air</b> as the

be forwarded to you by email. Please remember that whatever email you use for
your donation is the one I will use to contact you if I have any questions
(such as t-shirt sizing, details for your custom illustrations, or preferences

the fundraiser continues and after it’s conclusion to ensure the timely filling

With the help and suggestions of readers in the Forums, we have hammered
out some exciting Perks to thank you for your support. This includes a number
of the most popular items from previous fundraisers as well as some exciting
new loot!
You can, of course, simply pitch in a lump sum of money – but we are
offering a great number of exciting packages. So have a peruse to your right
and see if any of these levels excite your blood. Simply click on the one that
appeals the most, and note that some of them have limited numbers, so be sure
to grab them quickly before they’re all gone! 
PLEASE NOTE that some of the higher level
incentives have OPTIONS. Anywhere you
see the “OR” you must select one of
the other of this offered perk. Please leave
a comment with which one you select (or if you like to be clandestine, send
me an email) for my records. Also note that the highest tiers stack, which
means anything over the 80$ mark includes the perks from that tier and the
perks preceding it. Wow! That’s a lot of bang for your buck!
Since I'm the sole creator of this comic, I'm also the only one filling
the orders (including drawing the unique art and making your hand-crafted
prizes) so please have patience as I fill all of your orders. If you live OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA please include
an extra $10 in your donation to offset shipping costs. All parcels will be
sent Canada Post Expedited, or International Small Packet Air as the
destination requires. Wherever I can get tracking numbers I will, and they will
be forwarded to you by email. Please remember that whatever email you use for
your donation is the one I will use to contact you if I have any questions
(such as t-shirt sizing, details for your custom illustrations, or preferences
for your hand-crafted items). Please remember to check this email regularly as
the fundraiser continues and after it’s conclusion to ensure the timely filling
of your order. 

We need all hands on deck!
Even if you can’t pitch in any cold hard cash, there are still many
things you can do to help make this campaign a success. All it will take is a
little of your time and a little bit of noise-making!

Spread the word! Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Y!Gallery, DeviantART, Smackjeeves,
messageboards, classrooms, chatrooms, forums, blackboards, emails, quill and
ink!! Any method to get the word out there is the most important thing you can
do. Word of mouth advertising is the least expensive yet most effective method
out there.

Share the comic! If you know anyone you think might like Weaponry - please, encourage
them to read the comic, and get them excited about the fundraiser! This is not
only a chance to get Chapter 3 to print, it's a chance to spread the love of
the comic itself.
Indiegogo
has a number of helpful tools to make it easy to share this fundraiser
at the mere click of a button! 

Keep checking in! I’ll be adding up new content as
the fundraiser inches along, including our laborious Fundraiser video, sneak
peeks of the incentives and print volume and behind the scenes extras!

Shout out! If you have a webcomic, blog,
public journal or facebook page – I’d be happy to work with you to do an exclusive interview, Q & A or live chat to help promote the
fundraiser and add content to your project. If you’d be interested in setting
one of these up with me – drop me an email!

I could not have come this far without all of you. To everyone who reads
the comic, comments, supported a previous fundraiser or plans to support this
one. To everyone who lurks in the shadows, or shouts their love out from the crow’s
nest. To everyone who got a friend hooked, or just stumbled upon it by chance. You
are the reason I draw every panel on every page. Without you, I would not
continuously find myself inspired, heart-warmed, entertained and blessed to be
a part of this community. Your endless support and enthusiasm, patience and
good-will are awe-inspiring. I am so glad to have met each and every one of
you. Thank you for becoming my shipmates on this journey. Thank you for caring,
for reading and for voting. Thank you.
Now let’s set sail for grand adventure!!",5.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</h3>
<i>Peter is the Wolf</i> is the most popular project produced by White Lightning Productions, a small independent comics publisher. The webcomic ( <a href=""http://www.peteristhewolf.com/general/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.peteristhewolf.com/general/</a> ) is currently about midway through the third book of the story... which means we're long overdue to bring Book 2 (<i>Peter is the Wolf: Living in the Doghouse</i>) out in print format. <br/><br/>However, there are a couple of snags.<br/><br/>First, when we published <i>Peter is the Wolf</i> Book 1 we did it in two formats. One, for adults only, sold well enough. The other, with no adult material... hasn't sold nearly as well. Printing a version of Book 2 that everyone can enjoy would require that WLP tie up a significant chunk of money in product for years and years, waiting for the books to slowly sell enough to recoup the investment. Thanks to various financial setbacks stretching from October 2012 through this summer, that's money WLP can't afford to spend just now.<br/><br/>Second, the book's artist, Ben Rodriguez, is deep in debt and can't afford to give up his day job. In fact, he's had to work overtime as much as possible to help pay down his debt... which leaves him too worn out to do the TON of work required to get the pages posted on the website into print-quality condition. This has pushed the print date of ANY edition of Book 2 back again and again.<br/><h3>How You Can Help<br/>
</h3>We're shooting for a goal of $6,000. After advertising and other expenses of this campaign are deducted, the remaining amount will be split between the comic's artist Ben Rodriguez (to help pay his loans and make finishing Book 2 pages paying work) and WLP (to help offset the cost of printing Book 2).<br/><br/>If the campaign meets its base goal, we'll commit to officially releasing <i>Peter is the Wolf: Living in the Doghouse</i> at A-Kon in June 2014. Hard deadlines will be set, and top priority will be given to putting the book together and getting it printed. The book will be solicited to book and comic distributors and made available via Amazon.com and other online outlets, in addition to direct sales from WLP. Going over the goal will help both BAR-1 and WLP clear old debts even faster and may even produce special bonus material for the comic!<br/><br/>If the campaign fails to meet its goal, whatever we get will go towards BAR-1's debts and towards printing a one-time print-on-demand run of Peter is the Wolf: Living in the Doghouse strictly for our supporters. The costs of short-run printing mean we will NOT be able to offer the book wholesale to retailers if this happens- nor will we have much of an overrun to sell direct. Other perks like the T-shirt, cameos, Munny, etc. will be done and will ship regardless of whether or not the main goal is reached.<br/><br/>There will be an adults-only version of Book 2, but that has NOTHING to do with this project. This project is meant to support a version of the book that DOESN'T require a plain brown wrapper! We want the broadest possible audience of people who like silly comics and werewolves to be able to enjoy the story- and we really need your help to make this happen!<br/><h3>What You Get in Return<br/>
</h3>We've got a number of perks for our donors, ranging from the ordinary to the absolutely unique. If your pockets are deep enough, you could own a SKETCHBOOK full of original PitW artwork... or an unique statuette hand-painted by the artist himself... or you could even appear in the webcomic YOURSELF!<br/><br/><h3>Stretch Goal #1: $8,000<br/>
</h3>If we reach $8,000, WLP will commission an <i>Aminal Control</i> commemorative challenge coin (available as a $17 add-on to your donation) for our fans!

It has cropped up many times in many different forms for something like twenty years. The themes have always been the same even if the characters and story have changed. A number of times I have started it, mostly in collaboration with other writers. It never seemed to quite come together until finally somebody asked me why I didn't write it myself. That was the answer. Do it myself. I had always believed and been led to believe that I am not a writer. Artist , yes but writer, no. But why not? As I began to put together the framework and the plot and breathe life into the characters the story almost began to tell itself. And here we are. A project has come to life and all it really needs to take flight is an audience. This book will get published one way or another, that is for sure, but a little help and collaboration from its potential readers will give it wings. </span>

<div>
<b>So whats the story?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Ali is a 15 year old girl. An age in-between. An
age where she isn't a child or an adult. An age of confusion. Bullied at school and after a row with her
mother that she cant even remember the reason for she sits in her room. Alone. With that dark tension boiling in her gut again. Why is it like this? Why don’t
they ever listen?</div>
<div>
The tears dry in her eyes
and she grabs hold of the only thing she cares for from 'back then' and may even
take with her into her future, her toy rabbit... and falls asleep. </div>
<div>BANG! Eyes wide open she is
awake, or so she thinks. And then...
The adventure begins. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_5xMY59GTuN8/TVJmDWTPrOI/AAAAAAAAENM/G4uT4tD5vTg/street_small.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are then in a dream world interwoven with her daily life. It is within the dreamworld that the real story unfolds. Dreams are quite simply metaphor. It is in our dreams that we resolve issues about ourselves and our lives and Ali is no different. Only difference here is that she has a talking toy rabbit called Moon to guide her through the challenges that await her. </div>
<div>And what does she meet on the way? Well, all kinds of things, mostly VERY BIG ROBOTS. Ultimately though, she finds <i>herself</i> and that is the point. Her resolution is one we can all identify with as it deals with those very human issues of Love and Loss, Fear and Freedom and what becomes possible when we let go of the things about us that hold us back. Those ways of being, behaving and relating to our circumstances that stop us from being all we can be.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Why Horizon?</b></div>
<div>I have long been associated with comics as an artist and more specifically with robot comics. Well, <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_5xMY59GTuN8/TVKr22OGFNI/AAAAAAAAENQ/X5sr0evyFzs/Ali%20standing%20tone_low.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>TRANSFORMERS, to be specific. Many will know that one of my other interests is coaching. 'Self Development' if you will. It occurred to me that these two elements could be put together to provide something new and fresh within the graphic novel medium. My years of experience of participating in and training for Coaching, Dream therapy and Self Development is something that I committed to getting into a fictional narrative a while back. And this is going to be it. A gentle story about real people (with some really cool robots) that deals with what it is to be human the obstacles we put in the way of being all we can be. Dealing with and removing those barriers would make for an awesome life. There is no shortage of 'self help' books on the bookstore shelves for older readers but to have a graphic novel that is not not only racked with its fellow graphic novels but that also sat comfortably alongside Chopra, Dyer, Byrne, Robbins, McKenna, Tolle and the many others will be amazing. A powerful book for those that love a good adventure. </div>

</div></div>","'If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.""Dr Wayne Dyer""
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.""Mark Twain
""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.""Eleanor Roosevelt,

Ali is 15. Nothing works. School doesn't work, home doesn't work and everyone she loves is no longer there. Then she discovers an access to a place where all the answers can be found. Horizon. A place of dreams and metaphor and discovery. and ultimately freedom.

They say that we all have at least one book in us. For many years, during my time as an artist for MARVEL COMICS and other publishers and while working in TV and Games I have had a story rattling around in my head that just won't go away. It has cropped up many times in many different forms for something like twenty years. The themes have always been the same even if the characters and story have changed. A number of times I have started it, mostly in collaboration with other writers. It never seemed to quite come together until finally somebody asked me why I didn't write it myself. That was the answer. Do it myself. I had always believed and been led to believe that I am not a writer. Artist , yes but writer, no. But why not? As I began to put together the framework and the plot and breathe life into the characters the story almost began to tell itself. And here we are. A project has come to life and all it really needs to take flight is an audience. This book will get published one way or another, that is for sure, but a little help and collaboration from its potential readers will give it wings. 



So whats the story?

Ali is a 15 year old girl. An age in-between. An
age where she isn't a child or an adult. An age of confusion. Bullied at school and after a row with her
mother that she cant even remember the reason for she sits in her room. Alone. With that dark tension boiling in her gut again. Why is it like this? Why don’t
they ever listen?

The tears dry in her eyes
and she grabs hold of the only thing she cares for from 'back then' and may even
take with her into her future, her toy rabbit... and falls asleep. 
BANG! Eyes wide open she is
awake, or so she thinks. And then...
The adventure begins. 





We are then in a dream world interwoven with her daily life. It is within the dreamworld that the real story unfolds. Dreams are quite simply metaphor. It is in our dreams that we resolve issues about ourselves and our lives and Ali is no different. Only difference here is that she has a talking toy rabbit called Moon to guide her through the challenges that await her. 
And what does she meet on the way? Well, all kinds of things, mostly VERY BIG ROBOTS. Ultimately though, she finds herself and that is the point. Her resolution is one we can all identify with as it deals with those very human issues of Love and Loss, Fear and Freedom and what becomes possible when we let go of the things about us that hold us back. Those ways of being, behaving and relating to our circumstances that stop us from being all we can be.

Why Horizon?
I have long been associated with comics as an artist and more specifically with robot comics. Well, TRANSFORMERS, to be specific. Many will know that one of my other interests is coaching. 'Self Development' if you will. It occurred to me that these two elements could be put together to provide something new and fresh within the graphic novel medium. My years of experience of participating in and training for Coaching, Dream therapy and Self Development is something that I committed to getting into a fictional narrative a while back. And this is going to be it. A gentle story about real people (with some really cool robots) that deals with what it is to be human the obstacles we put in the way of being all we can be. Dealing with and removing those barriers would make for an awesome life. There is no shortage of 'self help' books on the bookstore shelves for older readers but to have a graphic novel that is not not only racked with its fellow graphic novels but that also sat comfortably alongside Chopra, Dyer, Byrne, Robbins, McKenna, Tolle and the many others will be amazing. A powerful book for those that love a good adventure. 

What We Need & What You Get

The book will be published. It is unlikely that it will be ready by the time this campaign expires but if you join in you will get constant updates as to when the launch will be. There has already been some interest from mainstream publishers but even if in the final analysis they choose not to take it I will publish it under my own PaperTheatre imprint. The funds raised here will act as seed money to cover some of the time that it will take to develop the book but also to cover some of the marketing costs. But its not necessarily about that. Its more to do with giving others the opportunity to be involved in the genesis of something new. A pre-order campaign that will allow you to be along for the ride and get your name forever in the book. Or to take up any of the other opportunities on offer here to order limited edition prints, deluxe format books and original artwork. The choice is yours. You can be involved as much as you like.


Take the plunge and be part of something that is not only exciting and new but that has the clear intention of making a difference to the lives of others. Oh and did I mention. it will have BIG robots.



Other Ways You Can HelpThere are other ways you can help with this. Put the word out. Enrol others in the idea. You dont have to 'sell' it to them just get their interest. Give them the opportunity to be involved in something new and exciting.

And don't forget to remind them about the share tools!

<h3>The Voluntaryist Comic Project</h3>
<p><img alt=""Campaign Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://voluntaryists.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/campaign-banner.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><em>CAMPAIGN CLOSING SOON!</em> ANY PERK HELPS! THE COMIC EVENTUALLY WILL BE RELEASED TO ALL FOR FREE (AFTER PERK PURCHASERS GET THEIR EARLY RELEASE), SO DON’T BE SHY TO SUPPORT!</strong></p>
<p><strong>STORY: </strong>“Voluntaryist” is about a superhero who finds himself pitted against the government as the government tries to enslave humanity once and for all.  He is a young man with extraordinary powers created through a chance encounter with cosmic radiation. His personal mission is to rescue his parents from government agents, but that objective is often frustrated with the likes of giant monsters, super-villains, and even the U.S. armed forces.</p>
<p>The purpose of this comic is to give a sense of what is going on in America and, in addition, to offer the reader inspiration that something can be done to stop the coming dystopian future. It also promotes voluntaryist values in the narrative. (If you don’t know what that is, simply google the “Non-aggression principle.”)</p>
<p><strong>CREATOR: </strong>The idea for the comic was created by Voluntaryist fanatic and costumer Jaime Sherman, whose passion for liberty is only matched by his passion for dressing in spandex super-suits. He began the long process of creating the series while trudging through his legal studies in school.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL:  </strong>Jaime's goal is to produce the first copy of the comic series on a .pdf to share with you, and, eventually, the world. <br/><br/><strong>We will produce as much of the comic as we can get funded for.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise about $4000 to get this comic fully going. The expenses are largely for the cost of hiring an artist to produce the comic and the expenses associated with putting the comic into digital format. <br/><br/>You can support us by making a <strong>contribution </strong>on the right-hand side by<strong> Credit Card/Debit Card</strong> or <strong>Paypal</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, you can redeem <strong>perks</strong> for your support such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>$8 – A personal “thank-you” by having your name read among others in this category in a youtube video.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><strong>$15 – The comic in .pdf format.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>$25 – Voluntaryist sticker + comic in .pdf format.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>$35 – 10 minutes to chat with Jaime via Skype + comic in .pdf format.<br/><br/>

<li>$50 – Limited Edition Re-Print of Voluntaryist Character drawing by J.C. Grande, signed and numbered by Jaime Sherman.</li>
</ul>

<li>$100 30-minute Skype chat with Jaime  + signed and printed comic + .pdf comic + personal thank-you card.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>$250 Banner-Ad Sponsor on the Back Page– get an advertisement (PG rated) in the back page of the comic book. (Limited to 6 Sponsors for the page).<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>$500 - <span>Have you ever wanted to be in a comic? Make an appearance in the comic book as a character (for this issue only) and receive a printed version of the comic, a .pdf, a 30-minute Skype chat, and a personal ""thank-you"" card from Jaime Sherman. You can pick whether you want to be friend, foe, or background character! Make sure you provide your correct mailing address and e-mail to receive this.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IF we do not reach our goal</strong> (but we will thanks to you!), we will produce as many pages of the comic as we can afford and still send those out to the people who donated to receive the comic in .pdf format/printed format.</p>
<h3>Production</h3>
<p>The comic will be produced primarily after the campaign is over, so the comic will be sent to you a few months after the 45 days are up.<br/><br/>However, we will give you teasers, sketches, and tidbits on our Website, <a href=""http://volcomic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://volcomic.com</a> so you can learn more about the backstory in anticipation of the comic's release.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>YOUR Impact</h3>
<p>While the comic is a fun relief from reality, our hope is that the comic is something beyond its entertainment value. We would like the comic to get into the hands of people who are unfamiliar with Voluntaryism and the current state of affairs. We want to wake people up to Voluntaryism and truly-free living using the comic medium because it communicates without being pretentious.</p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC RELEASE:<br/></strong></p>
<p>We will be releasing the comic for you to download for free (whatever we can find that will allow us to post it for free)…but those who paid to get the comic e-mailed or printed will receive it <span class=""caps"">FIRST</span> and will receive the comic about a month <span class=""caps"">AHEAD</span> of everyone else.</p>
<p>SO, with that in mind, don’t be shy about donating at the $5 or $8 levels because <span class=""caps"">EVERY </span>dollar counts to making the comic come into existence. That we need you to be our hero for!</p>

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>I am Hisham Kaine, author of the comic book Wahid: Weapon of mass destruction. For three years have I worked on this project and today we are a team of eight individuals doing our best to give you a unique but familiar experience. We launched a Kickstarter 33 days ago and reached our main goal and a first stretch goal of sum 5400 dollars, 144 backers. Now we are crowdfunding here on Indiegogo to reach our stretch goals so we can add a pin-up by Ian Miller, one free poster and make an audiobook of this project.</p>
<p><strong>Who is Hisham Kaine/creator?</strong></p>
<p>I was born in <strong>Sweden</strong>, but my parents are from<strong> Iraq</strong>. I see myself as one that has experience from both countries. It has given me lots of perspectives about culture, religion, politics and morality. I have been an avid fan of <strong>comics, games and movies</strong> for 30 years. It was my guide of right and wrong and has shaped me into being a person that wants to make a difference. Like ""Uncle Ben"" said: <strong>With great power, comes great responsibility</strong>. </p>
<p>In recent years, I became tired of the Middle Eastern <strong>role models</strong> being either <strong>dead prophets or bloodthirsty dictators</strong>. I want to create a character that questions <strong>itself, values ​​and ""God"".</strong> <strong>Freedom of speech</strong> is extremely important to me and I believe that if we do not use our<strong> creative freedom</strong>, there is a risk that it will be lost.</p>
<p><strong>Story of WAHID</strong></p>
<p>The story of WAHID plays out in a parallel world aligned with our reality. What if Saddam Hussein had a weapon of mass destruction. What if, that weapon was a super-soldier, set loose in Iraq in the year 2014, what would happen next? That is what I am trying to tell with my story. We have made a <strong>music theme, website, social media, 2 trailers</strong> and with your help, a <strong>""Mature"" comic book series.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why crowdfunding?</strong></p>
<p>To create <strong>#1</strong> of WAHID, we need your <strong>help</strong> to finance this project so that I can <strong>pay</strong> my artist <strong>Fredrik Mattsson</strong>, <strong>print</strong>, <strong>travel expenses</strong>, <strong>promotion</strong>, <strong>marketing costs</strong> and <strong>distribution</strong>. For helping us, you will get the first print issue 1 containing <strong>60</strong> pages in <strong>full-colour,</strong> and a <strong>story unlike anything you've ever seen before.</strong></p>

Introduction
I am Hisham Kaine, author of the comic book Wahid: Weapon of mass destruction. For three years have I worked on this project and today we are a team of eight individuals doing our best to give you a unique but familiar experience. We launched a Kickstarter 33 days ago and reached our main goal and a first stretch goal of sum 5400 dollars, 144 backers. Now we are crowdfunding here on Indiegogo to reach our stretch goals so we can add a pin-up by Ian Miller, one free poster and make an audiobook of this project.
Who is Hisham Kaine/creator?
I was born in Sweden, but my parents are from Iraq. I see myself as one that has experience from both countries. It has given me lots of perspectives about culture, religion, politics and morality. I have been an avid fan of comics, games and movies for 30 years. It was my guide of right and wrong and has shaped me into being a person that wants to make a difference. Like ""Uncle Ben"" said: With great power, comes great responsibility. 
In recent years, I became tired of the Middle Eastern role models being either dead prophets or bloodthirsty dictators. I want to create a character that questions itself, values ​​and ""God"". Freedom of speech is extremely important to me and I believe that if we do not use our creative freedom, there is a risk that it will be lost.
Story of WAHID
The story of WAHID plays out in a parallel world aligned with our reality. What if Saddam Hussein had a weapon of mass destruction. What if, that weapon was a super-soldier, set loose in Iraq in the year 2014, what would happen next? That is what I am trying to tell with my story. We have made a music theme, website, social media, 2 trailers and with your help, a ""Mature"" comic book series.
Why crowdfunding?
To create #1 of WAHID, we need your help to finance this project so that I can pay my artist Fredrik Mattsson, print, travel expenses, promotion, marketing costs and distribution. For helping us, you will get the first print issue 1 containing 60 pages in full-colour, and a story unlike anything you've ever seen before.




PLEDGES:  STRETCH GOALS:First stretch goal of adding 8 pages have been funded already via Kickstarter. 800 DOLLARS: We will hire Ian Miller for a bonus illustration of WAHID to put into the comic book. Ian will do the lineart while Fredrik will colour it as they have done together in earlier comics as Something Real, Holstered Heathen and Zombie with a Shotgun.Check out more art of Ian Miller: http://ianjmiller.com/Sample of Ian's work below:2 800 DOLLARS: we will give you an Exclusive New Art Print to those who bought the physical Print of Wahid to frame in your home :) 4 800 DOLLARS: We will make an Audio version of Wahid #1, voiced by me and others to give those with or without Vision variations (Visual impairment) a new experience. Check out trailer 2 at the top of this page for an example.Other Ways You Can Help

<h3><i><u>New Stretch Goal Added!!!</u></i></h3>
<p>The response to Boundless so far has been a joy to watch for us as creators but we know we can do so much more.  The production costs have been met, and then some, but our true goal with this campaign has always been to give as much as possible to the true frontline warriors in the battle against cancer.  For this reason we are adding a stretch goal at $10,000.  If we hit that mark all contributors who have pledged at the Sparklefists level or higher will receive a custom enamel pin of the Boundless logo.  You can help us out by sharing the campaign with anyone and everyone you can think of.  We still have three weeks left in the campaign, more than enough time to hit that goal, and we are brainstorming further goals as well.  Your generosity in supporting this campaign has been Boundless and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ORIGIN STORY</h3>
<p>As the owner of Horizon Comics I've always wanted to produce and publish a comic book. This past October our shop participated in the industry-wide challenge known as 24-Hour Comic Book Day, where the goal is for a single creator to produce a 24 page comic in 24 hours. </p>
<p>Because I see comics as predominantly collaborative efforts, I decided to fail the challenge from the start by enlisting two writers, two artists, and two inkers to complete the task. After 24 hours we had roughly half the comic finished, but realized at that point that we had a pretty special story going and an opportunity to use that story to do some good in the world. With this awareness, we have persistently worked to finish the comic, and I am proud to say that it is done. Now, we are offering you the chance to join us on this journey. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>SUITING UP</h3>
<p>Most of the perks speak for themselves, but I do want to take a second to talk about the covers. There will be 3 different covers for this comic: A regular cover, an Indiegogo exclusive variant, and an ultra-rare B&amp;W secret variant of the exclusive. Whatever size print run we end up having money for will be comprised mostly of the regular cover. The print run for the Indiegogo exclusive cover will be strictly limited to the number required to fulfill all perks plus a 5% overprint for damages and irregularities. The ultra-rare B&amp;W signed and numbered edition will be limited to no more than 25 copies. Period. </p>
<p>Our initial goal is modest: to produce a 1000 copy print run of our comic in black and white. $3,000 gets us there and covers all other perk production and fulfillment costs. Our secondary goal is to hire a colorist on a deadline so that we can produce a 1000 copy print run of our comic in full color and still deliver the goods to you by October. $5000 will get that done and cover all other perk production and fulfillment costs. Our ultimate goal is to raise as much money as we can to donate to a cancer research and treatment facility. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>BECOMING BOUNDLESS</h3>
<p>Now that all that's out of the way, we want you to know that our primary goal here is to raise money for cancer research and treatment. To do whatever we can to help those who are on the front lines fighting this disease. At this point we've done what we can do, and that's where you come in. We need you. We need your support.  Join our team - help our cause - we can do great things together! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHERE'S THE KRYPTONITE?</h3>
<p>Our goal is to deliver all perks on time and as advertised. That is the main reason that we've waited until the comic was finished prior to launching the campaign. And we've given ourselves a reasonable buffer for when we reach our secondary goal to produce a full color comic. And while I am 99% sure that we can deliver on or ahead of schedule, if the 1% should rear it's ugly head you will be informed immediately. </p>
<p>Money matters. We are not a 501(c)(3), so your contributions for perks are not tax deductible. But you and I both know that's not a reason to deny supporting this project, because you will get your money's worth in perks alone; and every dollar that gets donated will help people in need. Money raised above and beyond the $5,000 goal will be used toward: 1) Donation to a Cancer research and treatment facility 2) Any and all associated taxes and fees 3) Some measure of remuneration to the creators to say thank you for their hard work and 4) Any unforeseen or increased production and fulfillment costs </p>
</div><div>
<h3>POWERS OF PERSUASION</h3>
<p>The single most important thing that you can do to support this campaign is to help us get the word out. Please share our efforts with your friends, family and followers on social media. Right now. Do it, we'll wait right here and you'll feel better once you do...</p>

<h3><strong>Pitch</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine if six people had the power to change the world, but each had separate agendas. What would be the consequences of their actions and what kind of world would result?</p>
<h3>James Hudnall</h3>
<p>I'm a comics writer of over 30 years. I created Espers, The Psycho, The Age of Heroes, Streets, was a founder of the Malibu Ultraverse (created Hardcase and the Solution), wrote for DC and Marvel. This is a labor of love, It's an idea I have had for some time but the characters I created 3 years ago when I lost my right leg. I always felt if superhumans really existed in the real world, and tried to change it, the results would be far from predictable. Power systems do not like competition or interlopers.</p>
<p>I've teamed up with the talented Cossin brothers (Matt and Mikey) to bring this dream to reality.</p>

<h3>48 Page Issues</h3>
<p>My goal is to launch a series of 48 page quarterly comics. This campaign is to kick off the series. We already have over a quarter of the first issue done and we're looking for your help to bring it home.  This is a continuing story. Each arc will be collected later into trades. The first story will be four issues at 184 pages with additional material.</p>

<p>I have been in comics since 1986. I am an award-winning writer with one TV show produced based on my work (Harsh Realm) and my books have won awards in other countries besides the US. I am fully experienced in creating original content. Look at my bibliography page at <a href=""http://jameshudnall.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://jameshudnall.com/about-2/bibliography</a>. I have written the first issue already.</p>
<p>Matt Cossin (Time Cheeta) is a very exciting new talent and his brother Mikey Cossin is doing fantastic color work. We are all dedicated to doing a comic like no other in the genre.</p>
<p>The challenge for us is having the funding to produce the work. We have a good printer picked out that produces high quality and will fulfill the books for contributors, </p>
<p>This is the first book for our company, <a href=""http://thefreedomforge.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Freedom Forge</a>, which is designed to provide a place for creators who want to work outside of the corporate publishers and do work that's not constricted by their limitations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is not political in the sense that it's an attack on any political party. I am not out to alienate anyone. I seek to entertain. I write stories to stand the test of time. But the themes and issues in this story are generally untouched by entertainment today. This is a comic that will deal with areas the media does not want to touch. Our comic has no adult content but its a comic for grown-ups. This is a story that will challenge you and will hopefully open a lot of eyes.</p>

Imagine if six people had the power to change the world, but each had separate agendas. What would be the consequences of their actions and what kind of world would result?
James Hudnall
I'm a comics writer of over 30 years. I created Espers, The Psycho, The Age of Heroes, Streets, was a founder of the Malibu Ultraverse (created Hardcase and the Solution), wrote for DC and Marvel. This is a labor of love, It's an idea I have had for some time but the characters I created 3 years ago when I lost my right leg. I always felt if superhumans really existed in the real world, and tried to change it, the results would be far from predictable. Power systems do not like competition or interlopers.
I've teamed up with the talented Cossin brothers (Matt and Mikey) to bring this dream to reality.


48 Page Issues
My goal is to launch a series of 48 page quarterly comics. This campaign is to kick off the series. We already have over a quarter of the first issue done and we're looking for your help to bring it home.  This is a continuing story. Each arc will be collected later into trades. The first story will be four issues at 184 pages with additional material.

Our Goal
I have been in comics since 1986. I am an award-winning writer with one TV show produced based on my work (Harsh Realm) and my books have won awards in other countries besides the US. I am fully experienced in creating original content. Look at my bibliography page at http://jameshudnall.com/about-2/bibliography. I have written the first issue already.

The challenge for us is having the funding to produce the work. We have a good printer picked out that produces high quality and will fulfill the books for contributors,

<p>I created Cat and Meringue way back in 2010, as a way to challenge myself as an artist to draw something every day. What started out as a silly daily comic side project became one of the best-loved things I have ever created and spawned a fan base larger and more awesome than I could have ever imagined!</p>

<p>Cat and Meringue sail a never ending ocean of silliness and adventure meeting weird characters, discovering strange lands and along the way working out that they are in a comic and that I, the artist, have it in for them! In the time that I have drawn them they have grown from a couple of silly squiggles on paper, to 2 of my best friends.</p>

<p>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</p>
<p>I won’t lie to you, this is my second crack at raising funds to create these plushies. The first attempt was on Kickstarter and I was asking for more money because I wanted some deluxe packaging. We made £4000 there which wasn't enough for the goal but enough to actually make the plushies themselves. Unfortunately I couldn't keep that money. Thats why I am back here with a lower goal that I know we can achieve as we have hit it before. The packaging is gone from the project and its focused on the plushies. I know we can do it!</p>
<p>I’ve never made plushies before, only books. But I’ve made a lot of books and done a lot of crowdfunding. I know what it takes to fulfill large orders, maintain communications with backers and how to manage time and funds.</p>
<p>The company producing the toys have proven themselves to be reliable and fast and very good at what they do. The main risks and challenges will be packaging and sending a large quantity of toys out myself and also maintaining quality control. I will take special care and focus on these points to ensure it is a success. If the delivery is delayed for any reason (i'm sure it won't be, but you never know with factories) then I will be sure to keep you updated.</p>

<p>Hey! I'm Josh P.M. comics artist, illustrator, ska musician, and general ""cool dude"".</p>
<p>You might know me from The Adventures of Hardcore Dan, or you MIGHT NOT! Either way, this indiegogo is about my new minicomic project which is brand-spanking new and will be my first new self-published work since 2010! </p>
<p>This new project is tentatively titled Space Stories, which is a working title and is subject to (many) changes. The actual book will have a couple science fiction stories that I've been kicking around for some time. I've been in grad school for a bit now for Illustration so I believe I've gotten to a point where I can finally tackle these narratives and make something pretty cool! </p>
<p>In addition to helping me finish and print this comics, the funds raised here will also help me get to the Toronto Comics and Arts Festival (TCAF) coming up in May (where I will have some physical copies of the book!) where I will hock my wares and say hi to you if you will also be there and we can drink beverages together!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Whyyy what's in it for meee?</h3>
<p>As an art grad student I am continuously racking up thousands of dollars in debt! I'd like to keep my comics making in the black and be able to have fun making this book without as much concern for the printing and travel costs. </p>
<p>100% of proceeds will be going towards the production of the books and travel to TCAF no matter how much I make! This is essentially a pre-order of the book in its various forms (electronic and physical) with the opportunity to contribute to my travel expenses and get awesome stuff in return.</p>
<p>As for the perks, hopefully there will be a level that everyone is comfortable contributing to and I will provide cool stuff at each teir. There will be no ""$1 for a high-five"" or ""$12 for my undying appreciation"" because you are here to make sure art gets made but also to get some rad stuff, so please take a gander at the fun stuff throughout the perks! They'll include everything from .PDF's of the comic (and some older work too) to custom drawings and maybe even a personalized song performed by me (it doesn't have to be ska if you don't want that but make sure to specify because ska is my default setting).</p>
<p>Note: I will probably be sending any mail orders out after TCAF, so look for physical perks to be delivered around the end of May!</p>

It's a western/fantasy mash-up with a very mythic 
feel. Think A Fistful of Dollars meets Hellboy, sprinkled with seasonings from HP Lovecraft's secret drug stash.Dead Mage follows the story of Dirt, the aging sheriff of a 
frontier town, and his headstrong young deputy, Charlotte Granger. This 
is a world where gunslingers use magic as readily as bullets. Where 
demonic incursions regularly threaten to destroy the mortal world. Where
 the only thing keeping you from being dead is a quick draw and a sharp 
mind.But when an incursion razes his town and leaves Dirt with an
 unhealable wound, he and Charlie begin a journey that will take them 
across the desert and into the depths of Hell itself. You will see: 
tentacles, eye patches, and a demon getting shot three times with one 
bullet.

Lots of people tell me that they love my Facebook cartoons, they love my Facebook jokes, and they love the witty remarks and self-deprecating comments and semi-embarrassing confessions and off-color innuendoes and bitter, deranged rants that I post on Facebook all day. 
But here's the thing: I can't keep giving this stuff away for free. 

You love my cartoons on Facebook, right? Have I brought a smile to your face? Have I helped to brighten your day, or at least helped you while away the long, stifling hours in your cubicle, or helped you to ignore your children for a few precious moments of mirth and mental respite? Are you not entertained? 

Then stop being a worthless, ungrateful freeloader and help me! 
Here's what I want to do: 


I want to make a really, really awesome HD video of my next big comedy show. (Date and Location TBA)

I need money to do it.
You have money. Will you give me some of your money? Not even ""all"" of your money, not even ""most"" of your money, but just ""some"" of it?
If you want me to keep making Facebook cartoons, I'd love it if you'd give me a small amount of your money to support me in doing this comedy thing.

If you give me $25, I will make a Facebook cartoon of you and me that you can cherish forever. I'll even design your very own Facebook cartoon avatar (if you don't have one already). 


Help Me Help You Help ME!
I need $500 (or so) to help fund the filming and production of a high-quality HD concert video of my next comedy show - in a similar style to what you'd see in an HBO comedy special from Louis C.K. or other professional comedians. I need this video to look really good - with good lighting, soundboard audio, and a boom mic to capture all of the audience laughter. I want this video to make me look like a far better comedian than I actually am - and that costs money. 

I need to pay my videographer to film the show, record the audio, and splice it all together with snazzy video editing techniques. 
I'm going to offer some FABULOUS perks for people who donate. 
Even if we don't reach our entire fundraising goal, even if we only get $100, the money will still help cover the costs. Just give what you can - no guilt, no obligation, no worries, no pressure... 

Oh, who am I kidding: PRESSURE! Give $5, $10, or $25! Check out our list of FABULOUS perks! C'mon! GIVE ME YOUR MONEY. For just $25, you can be my co-star in a fun Facebook cartoon like this one: 




What's In It for You? 
If you love to see the funny stuff I post on Facebook every day, here is a simple way that you can make a difference and help me keep doing what I do. If you want to support one of your favorite funny people on Facebook and help me take my comedy career to the next level, this is the time to do it.




Having a really good video of my next show will give me some excellent video clips that I can use when applying to comedy festivals. (Which is one of the best ways to improve my comedy career.) 
This video will help me get more comedy gigs and expand my comedy thing to a larger audience.
This video will give me a fun way to commemorate the show and give everyone a unique souvenir. Let's do this! Together!



Are You Broke? 
""But Ben,"" you say, ""Like most of my fellow 300 million Americans, I'm really, really broke! I can't afford to give you even $5, because I'm about to get evicted!"" 
No problem! (I mean - getting evicted is definitely a problem. Good luck with that. Seriously.) 
But even if you're too broke to donate, you can still help:

Help spread the word about this campaign - ask your friends to chip in a few bucks so we can all enjoy more amusing procrastination material on Facebook!

As always, thank you for your support of my reckless, belligerent narcissism.

<h3>The Setting</h3>
<p>Jonah's Harbor, Maine is a tiny coastal mill town, which in the summer of '77, finds itself once again in transition.  The mills are closing, and previous industries (shipbuilding, shoe manufacturing, poultry) are gone for good.  Will the town's salvation come in the form of new businesses taking advantage of the cheap land and an eager labor pool, or will a darker force capture Jonah's Harbor in its evil grip?</p>

<p>If you share our love for vampire stories, especially ones inspired by modern film classics where average kids become heroes that embark on fantastic and dangerous missions, we think you'll really dig what we are up to. Those are the kind of stories that shaped us during our formative years. Our whole team feels in this modern climate, tales of heroic kids are particularly resonant and we want to bring more of these stories into the world.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although our creative team is still very new to the world of comics, we have successfully met and exceeded the crowdfunding goal for our first issue. Our entire team has had great success in the past for various creative projects, and have delivered on each one of them. We are no strangers to the hard work and long hours it takes to deliver a high-quality product, and we've surrounded ourselves with some very accomplished mentors in the comic publishing community. That being said, we are a team of humans, and there could very well be life hurdles we cannot predict along our path. We promise to be as transparent as possible​ and to give ample updates along our creative journey through our email newsletter. You will be made aware of any issues we encounter. No one wants to see this book get made more than we do, and we will give it all we have to make this as awesome as it can be.</p>

People who grew up on movies like Fright Night, Lost Boys, The Goonies, Stand By Me, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Gate, Monster Squad, Gremlins, E.T., Cloak and Dagger, The Explorers… any of those timeless classics from the 80s where it’s up to the kids to save the world. (And a story that isn't afraid to put our heroic kids in serious danger.) 
Readers of bleeding edge comics like Sabrina, Afterlife with Archie, Monstress, Lumberjanes & Motor Crush 
Fans of Stephen King stories/films like Salem’s Lot, It and Stand By Me (The Body) and other spooky tales set in New England
People who love the commitment to detail and setting in the hit series Stranger Things 
Fans of Dracula and other classic vampire stories
Fans of Neil Gaiman’s young adult horror stories Coraline and The Graveyard Book - We've got some vampire violence and light swearing but depending on your child, we'd rate our book a PG-13.
If you'd enjoy a comic with the pacing of an old school horror film, atmospheric visuals, and starring a cast of characters you care about, THIS IS YOUR BOOK!

 
What do you get with Night Is Falling #1?
Night Is Falling #1 is a full color comic book that will be 30+ pages in standard American comic size, on high-quality gloss paper. It's the first of 10 planned issues that cover our 1977 story arc.
Backers get a digital and/or physical copy of the book. 
Includes 30+ pages of story (no ads) plus bonus content at the end of the book.
We have a limited supply of the super-rare variant cover by Illustrator Tom Brown of the hit gothic steampunk comic series ""Hopeless, Maine."" Only 100 issues of this version will even be printed and only 30 will be available on here! You'll also have the opportunity to add on a digital bundle of great extra content to immerse yourself in. If you want a deeper look and listen to the world of NIGHT IS FALLING, check out the digital bundle add-on option during checkout!
 

The Creative Team

 
Also, when time permits, we slay vampires. 
 


If you share our love for vampire stories, especially ones inspired by modern film classics where average kids become heroes that embark on fantastic and dangerous missions, we think you'll really dig what we are up to. Those are the kind of stories that shaped us during our formative years. Our whole team feels in this modern climate, tales of heroic kids are particularly resonant and we want to bring more of these stories into the world.  
 
Risks & Challenges
Although our creative team is still very new to the world of comics, we have successfully met and exceeded the crowdfunding goal for our first issue. Our entire team has had great success in the past for various creative projects, and have delivered on each one of them. We are no strangers to the hard work and long hours it takes to deliver a high-quality product, and we've surrounded ourselves with some very accomplished mentors in the comic publishing community. That being said, we are a team of humans, and there could very well be life hurdles we cannot predict along our path. We promise to be as transparent as possible​ and to give ample updates along our creative journey through our email newsletter. You will be made aware of any issues we encounter. No one wants to see this book get made more than we do, and we will give it all we have to make this as awesome as it can be.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>For the last two+ years listeners to the indie Volt radio network and podcasts have seen and heard a number of creators talk about the world of creating, publishing, distributing, selling, reading and loving comics. Now, to celebrate the podcast network's second anniversary, as well as Arrow Comics' return to publishing, Indie Volt contributors gather their best stories into a one-of-a-kind volume you do NOT want to miss! More than a display of ""put up or shut up"", or ""preview snippets"", this volume is a fantastic collection of self-contained short stories that anyone who loves comics will enjoy, whether they know what an ""Indie Volt"" is or not!</p>
<p>This volume BEGINS with over 100 standard comics sized square-bound pages in black and white, sequential art designed to display what comics are truly capable of! A world-wide collection of artists and writers from all walks of life have put their best work on display here, so much in fact that we've made it a ""flip book"", like those great old Ace paperbacks, here you go though at least 50 pages of comics THEN TURN THE BOOK OVER and go in again with at least another 50 pages of comics and stories! This gives you TWO great full-color front covers in one handy volume!</p>
<p>Collecting these stories and production on this volume has been no easy feat. This product has been the brainchild of Indie Volt host Randy Zimmerman for almost the last year. Randy is co-creator of Arrow Comics' first regularly published comic, Tales From The Aniverse and has over 35 years of experience producing, creating, selling and distributing comics.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615862065/gcmcswafdoqmjpj7xxhm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><b>No Frills, just GREAT Comics!</b></h3>
<p>This volume showcases the talents of over TWO DOZEN sequential artists, almost all of which have been featured on episodes of the Indie Volt podcast. Additional 'stretch goals"" will be offered as well to make this book literally as big as the backers allow!  We are also only offering two versions of this book to be printed and the print run WILL BE LIMITED to this campaign and a few extras for retailers and contributors.  As they say in those ads 'once they're gone, they're GONE!""</p>
<p>""Print-On-demand"" has forever changed this industry. As of this campaign's posting, this book is already 90% IN HOUSE and ready for printing. Once this campaign ends, and barring any stretch goal hold-ups or glitches, we will go to press and get this book into your hands immediately.  We have an experienced printer within a small drive from Arrow Comics HQ who does great quality square-bound books, and because it is POD our final backer numbers are secondary to getting these books in your hands, that's why our ""goal"" is flexible and low.</p>

<p>For Indie Volt's international radio audience we will be offering the book in physical form (we're sorry, but you'll have to cover postage) OR, for our readers outside of the North American continent (because we know how crazy postage has gotten), we are offering a complete pdf file at a special price. this pdf will contain ALL of the covers offered, ALL the stretch goals this campaign might achieve, AND a few added surprises of additional Arrow product as well.  If you've enjoyed the Indie volt podcasts over the last few years you know we have no outside funding besides a few great sponsors. now is the time to show your appreciation to the show and our talent as well!</p>
<p>For our retailer friends in the direct market, we are offering a genuine ""Retailer Tier"" where you are welcome to purchase multiple copies of Revolt at a retailer discount (retail store verification requested).</p>
<p>Arrow Comics knows this is our first crowd-funder, so fulfillment will be top priority. Anyone familiar with Arrow's quality in the past (The Realm, The Dead, Dark Oz, Spank The Monkey and more) know our commitment  to quality and creator ownership is second to none.  Additional stretch goals to this campaign will include samples of some of those older Arrow products that we are just as proud to be associated with today as we are with Indie Volt Revolt!  Some of that product also features work(s) from Revolt contributors as well!</p>

</div><div><p> </p></div></div>","Indie Volt Revolt!
For the last two+ years listeners to the indie Volt radio network and podcasts have seen and heard a number of creators talk about the world of creating, publishing, distributing, selling, reading and loving comics. Now, to celebrate the podcast network's second anniversary, as well as Arrow Comics' return to publishing, Indie Volt contributors gather their best stories into a one-of-a-kind volume you do NOT want to miss! More than a display of ""put up or shut up"", or ""preview snippets"", this volume is a fantastic collection of self-contained short stories that anyone who loves comics will enjoy, whether they know what an ""Indie Volt"" is or not!
This volume BEGINS with over 100 standard comics sized square-bound pages in black and white, sequential art designed to display what comics are truly capable of! A world-wide collection of artists and writers from all walks of life have put their best work on display here, so much in fact that we've made it a ""flip book"", like those great old Ace paperbacks, here you go though at least 50 pages of comics THEN TURN THE BOOK OVER and go in again with at least another 50 pages of comics and stories! This gives you TWO great full-color front covers in one handy volume!
Collecting these stories and production on this volume has been no easy feat. This product has been the brainchild of Indie Volt host Randy Zimmerman for almost the last year. Randy is co-creator of Arrow Comics' first regularly published comic, Tales From The Aniverse and has over 35 years of experience producing, creating, selling and distributing comics.

No Frills, just GREAT Comics!
This volume showcases the talents of over TWO DOZEN sequential artists, almost all of which have been featured on episodes of the Indie Volt podcast. Additional 'stretch goals"" will be offered as well to make this book literally as big as the backers allow!  We are also only offering two versions of this book to be printed and the print run WILL BE LIMITED to this campaign and a few extras for retailers and contributors.  As they say in those ads 'once they're gone, they're GONE!""
""Print-On-demand"" has forever changed this industry. As of this campaign's posting, this book is already 90% IN HOUSE and ready for printing. Once this campaign ends, and barring any stretch goal hold-ups or glitches, we will go to press and get this book into your hands immediately.  We have an experienced printer within a small drive from Arrow Comics HQ who does great quality square-bound books, and because it is POD our final backer numbers are secondary to getting these books in your hands, that's why our ""goal"" is flexible and low.

For Indie Volt's international radio audience we will be offering the book in physical form (we're sorry, but you'll have to cover postage) OR, for our readers outside of the North American continent (because we know how crazy postage has gotten), we are offering a complete pdf file at a special price. this pdf will contain ALL of the covers offered, ALL the stretch goals this campaign might achieve, AND a few added surprises of additional Arrow product as well.  If you've enjoyed the Indie volt podcasts over the last few years you know we have no outside funding besides a few great sponsors. now is the time to show your appreciation to the show and our talent as well!
For our retailer friends in the direct market, we are offering a genuine ""Retailer Tier"" where you are welcome to purchase multiple copies of Revolt at a retailer discount (retail store verification requested).
Arrow Comics knows this is our first crowd-funder, so fulfillment will be top priority. Anyone familiar with Arrow's quality in the past (The Realm, The Dead, Dark Oz, Spank The Monkey and more) know our commitment  to quality and creator ownership is second to none.  Additional stretch goals to this campaign will include samples of some of those older Arrow products that we are just as proud to be associated with today as we are with Indie Volt Revolt!  Some of that product also features work(s) from Revolt contributors as well!
 
This volume includes:
more than 15 stories featuring a vast variety of sequential art. Complete short stories designed to showcase the quality of talent you hear every week on the Indie volt radio network and podcasts including:

Every comic has a true retro feel and the variety of the stories extend from a dancer making a deal with the devil to time traveling soda lovers and magic fights. The artists of Golden GardenHere are all of our amazing artists that are participating in the anthology! Anette Bengtsson/DotsAndSwirls'Bunny Queen'A witch and her dearest friend, a little bunny named Queen, are fighting a battle against time to cast a spell before the world falls to pieces.

</p><p><b>The Creator</b>: Being a long
time fan of comic books and comic book movies, it was only a matter of time
before Ray Zepeda would eventually turn his love for comics into a career
choice. For the last decade Ray has been pushing forward trying to make his
dream a reality and having met Ryan Scales (Iron Lion Studios) in 2008, and
launching <b>Tragic Hero Comics</b> in
2012; that reality is almost here! Tragic Hero Comics needs <b>YOU</b> now!</p>
<p><b>The Story:</b> A secret society
known as the Department of Advanced Research and Knowledge (D.A.R.K. for short)
attempts to create perfect soldiers by secretly testing the youth of America…
Years later the project is suddenly shut down without so much as a word and every
test subject is subsequently tracked down and terminated… </p>
<p>…Or
so they thought… </p>
<p>As
it turns out 113 of the original test subjects managed to slip through the
cracks because they had failed to yield positive results from the testing done
to them as children. Not only did they survive D.A.R.K.’s massacre but they
managed to stay hidden for years until something put them back on D.A.R.K.’s
radar… </p>
<p>…
Get ready to find out how it all goes down in this explosive prelude to
AntiHero: 113!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Goal:</b> Tragic Hero

is where you wonderful people come in we need to raise <b><u>$850</u></b> dollars for this campaign! That’s it! </p>
<p><b><i>Why

*日本語ページはこちら!(日本語ページからリターンへ直接ジャンプも可能になりました。）http://bit.ly/1msfODGI’m turning your moving moments into video.
I’ve succeeded in being the first to make the
emotional power of Manga and turn it into a product:
The personalized, hand-drawn manga called “Para-Para
Manga” 
“Para-Para” manga is based on original Japanese animation
techniques, using paper to, page by page, make the images come alive.
What makes Para-Para Manga different from regular anime or manga?What was once a picture, Para-Para
Manga becomes a movie, breathing life into the images, creating a warm,
comfortable feeling.
The Para-Para Manga that Kando Studios offers is not
limited to things like weddings; they work perfectly for promotional videos and
have been used by major communication companies and others like Goldman Sachs
Securities.We’ve received positive comments and feedback from tourist and foreigners living in Japan.

""It’s a really good job and a really great idea for weddings. "" ""Even if I don’t understand all the Japanese characters, I was able to understand the story and impressed.” 
”This movie is different from any other way such as slideshow or letter. ""How We Create
1.Story Hearing
Para-Para Manga does what film cannot: express the
thoughts and images in your mind to the world. But it first needs to be made
concrete. 
So, we’ll ask you what you want to use Para-Para manga
for and have a short consultation.
2.Story Graph Creation
We’ll make a custom graph of your ideas, what you want
to say, and the emotions you want to convey and create unique, one-of-a-kind
scenario for you.
3.Story Board Creation
We’ll put each story into a story board.
In
about one month a specialized Manga artist draw your 500 page Para-Para Manga
4.Image to AnimationWe’ll turn your images into animation using carefully
selected music.What We NeedIn order to bring Para-Para Manga to the world, we need to make the following things:· An English Website· An American Para-Para Manga promotion videoWhat You GetAn illustrated postcard $10USDAn illustrated postcard commemorating Para-Para Manga's world debut.Your original postcard $20USDAn illustrated postcard of you, characterized as a manga character. The promotion video. $50USDWe’ll put your name in the credits of the promotion video.appear in the promotion video. $100USDYou will appear in the promotion video. special Para-Para Manga. $200USDWe’ll give you a special Para-Para Manga present Or we’ll give you the story board made for the promotion video. Para-Para Manga just for you. $500USDWe’ll make a thank you Para-Para Manga just for you.[Original Movie]We will provide your original movie as bellow.Para-Para Manga original. $1,000USDWe’ll make a 1-minute Para-Para Manga original on a story you choose【Limited to five people】Para-Para Manga original. $1,500USDWe’ll make a 2-minute Para-Para Manga original on a story you choos【Limited to three people】 ※In order to make your story, we will conduct astory hearing via Skype or email.※Every Perk will be delivered digitally

<p>Just like most of you, I got tired of people hogging the 
machines/equipments at the gyms by sitting on their phones. I got tired 
of people working out their fingers and thumb instead of the rest of 
their body. Tired of people sitting and chatting by the gym equipment I 
want to use, but they're using it as a couch. Now join me and send a 
message with this ""WorkOut or WalkOut"" fun logo to not just these folks, but also to those who spend way more unnecessary time on the couch playing video games, 'facebooking', texting, and all that ""finger/thumb training."" <br/>It's not smart to drive while ""inTEXTicated"" so why workout ""inTEXTicated""? The phone can wait. We
 all know Time is Money. The time wasted by a lot of people on their phones at the gym 
and on the couch at home is more than enough for a quick workout to stay healthy
 for day to day activities. <br/></p>

productive things. Most importantly, you're helping to launch a small business that will be a stepping stone for so many other good things to come.

RIOT, Space Criminal  

HERE'S
a link to the original pilot story FOOL'S BRIEFCASE. Go give it a
read and come on back! THE
ORIGINAL STORY


YOU'RE
BACK! Awesome! Did
you dig it? Hope you did. The story originally ran in my DIY
anthology OMINOUS SOFA. I set out to do a 13 page caper sci-fi story
and what it grew into was a real chuckle and a genuine a love for
space criminal ROY RIOT and his robot partner CRAIG. By the time the
ink was drying on the last page I found myself just aching to write
and draw more of their exploits and all the cool, crazy space stuff
burned on my weird brain. 

The Misadventure Continues
With
Crime & Space I want to continue to tell the weird, gritty tale
of ROY RIOT, a criminal operating in the depths of dirty space that's
as quick with his gun as he is with his mouth. Armed only with his
wit, a pair of Laser 45s and his automated partner CRAIG, he roams the
galaxy in his souped-up saucer staying one step ahead of the law and
armed and ready to pull off that one big score.

However it does mean that less books will be printed :( 
So don't wait for it to hit the shelves because that might not happen. Buy it now and sleep easy my friends. 

UPGRADES!
If you've already purchased an Ink Tales perk, there's still time to UPGRADE!!
All you have to do is contribute the difference and send me an email at dale.maccanti@hotmail.com

Now it's about time that we revealed the amazing INK TALES cover created by Jeffrey 'Chamba' Cruz.




Book Specs: 120 pages, large format (28.5 x 19.5cm), colour cover, b/w interior, soft cover tpb.

Beardy and the Geek Review

<p>We are all passionate about comics and storytelling. We are also committed and motivated to make our goals a reality. As for who we are, this can be seen in the second video below.</p>
<p>Our campaign is important to us because this is one of the steps to achieving our goals. Publication takes money, the work has already been done and more work is ongoing. We will publish and we need your help to reach a wider audience, more quickly.</p>
<p>I cannot express how useful a successful campaign would be for our goals. Your funds will ensure that our six issue story arc will get printed and reach the widest possible audience which, in turn, leads to more issues in the ever growing story of Avenger Red. But that is not all. During this time, while our comics get published, we will be using the issues we have and our own hard work in a direct effort to increase our visibility and draw more anxious readers into our story. The greater the success of this fundraiser, the more comics we can print for immediate distribution and the more events and comic shops we can attend to introduce our work.</p>
<p>We did our best to make the amount needed a reasonable goal. These funds alone will ensure the printing continues through the first story arc. A more successful goal will, of course, help us with more issues printed as well as enable us to do exciting promotional events.</p>
<p>We have already discussed stretch goals should we meet our goal before the deadline and look forward to implementing them as well as introducing more perks as needed.</p>
<p>Even if our goal is not met, the funds will ensure that you, and your pledge, will get your perks as well as print all that we can.</p>
<p>We have already had one successful project fundraiser (on the other sight) with all perks being awarded to those pledges and that project achieved a successful completion.</p>
<p>I believe in the story of Avenger Red on various levels and believe it has a place in the world of comics. The rest of my creative team: Free Isabelo and Daniel Blodgett also believe in its validity as a story and a product. We're not looking to change the world, but we are looking to entertain, excite and explore interesting themes and concepts through our story. And we want all of you to be a part of it!</p>

<h3>The Pride Adventures</h3>
<p><em>The Pride</em>, a six issue mini series by Joe Glass, Gavin Mitchell, Kris Carter and more is already funded and in production, but we realised that there is so much more to the world of <em>The Pride</em> and these characters than can be contained in one series.</p>
<p><em>The Pride Adventures</em> continues to look at the world and role of LGBTQ superheroes, expanding their universe, letting us get to know the characters better and even introducing whole new characters to the universe.</p>
<p>But unlike some other companies, these stories are completely self-contained.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What is 'The Pride'?</strong></p>
</div>
<p><em>The Pride</em> is a six-issue mini-series written by Joe Glass, and with art by rising star Gavin MItchell, and Kris Carter. The series is currently published by Deadstar Publishing before returning to its self-publishing roots in 2013.</p>
<p><em>The Pride Adventures</em> will expand the world and characters of the series, with a number of short, self-contained stories by a range of other artists.</p>
<p>Issue one features a six-page <em>It Gets Better</em> story with series artist Gavin Mitchell which hasn't seen print since the limited self-published <em>Stiffs/The Pride</em> ashcan in 2011; A Twink/White Trash short drawn by Samir Barrett; and finally a story introducing a brand new character and art by JD Smith, and thanks to the very gracious band The Irrepressibles including the lyrics of their fantastic single '<em>In This Shirt</em>'. </p>
<p><em>The Pride Adventures</em> #1 is aiming for release later in the year, looking toward a November/December release.</p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>I'm Joe Glass, and I'm a gay man who loves comics. Luckily, I also happen to be a writer.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, and coming to terms with my sexuality, one of the things I always felt sad about was the fact there were no visible, openly gay superheroes I could relate to. Sure, there were one or two, but they lived in the background or were poorly reresented. Ever since then, I wanted to change that. And that's what <em>The Pride</em> is all about.</p>
<p>However, this is not a paying gig for me, it's literally a labour of love.</p>
<p>The production time for <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ThePrideComic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>The Pride</em></a> has proven a long process, and we've had a stumbling start which has left us in a position, for a number of reasons, where we will start afresh and relaunch the project in Late SPring/Summer 2013, with a regular release schedule and a host of amazing artists on board.</p>
<p>But there was so much more of the world I wanted to show; so much more for the characters to say and so many amazing artists wanting to contribute.</p>
<p>Thus <em>The Pride Adventures</em> was born!</p>
<p>The series will be a sister project to <em>The Pride</em> and will be released alongside the main series, expanding the world and characters and even introducing new ones, until a broad, inclusive and exciting new universe becomes available to our readers.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The whole point of doing this project is to provide young LGBT comics readers with heroes they can look up to, and older ones with heroes they can relate to; it's to cover issues that straight readers may not be aware of, or may have disregarded as something which 'doesn't affect them' when they affect all of us; it can hopefully change some opinions and help push for an improvement in representation; and most of all, it will be fun!</p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money raised by this project will be used to pay for printing this comic.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each donation can be used as a kind of 'pre-order' that we can show larger distributors like Diamond the kind of numbers we can achieve, so hopefully they will work with us to help distribute the comic as far and wide as possible. The other benefit of the project being on this site is that it's the best way to get your copy if you live in the United States or anywhere else outside of the UK. As yet, we are working on distribution deals in those territories, but we're not there yet. So your help will let us spread this message globally. Higher print runs and perorder numbers are of course also possible even if we don't hit the ultimate target, but the more we raise the better.</p>
<p>And also, due to the exchange rate, pre-ordering the comic in this way is a significant discount from retail price.</p>
<p>In fact, if we beat the target, then it just means we can print more, market more, and maybe even commission more artists to provide their help in the series. Anything to make this project as big and great as it can be! </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Even if you can't help fund the series, you can help spread the word! There are links to the comics Facebook and twitter pages, and I'll keep this project updated on any and all news on the comic, so you can keep helping by passing that inf+o on to anyone you know and encouraging them to help us. Thank You!</p>

Sure, there were one or two, but they lived in the background or were poorly reresented. Ever since then, I wanted to change that. And that's what The Pride is all about.
However, this is not a paying gig for me, it's literally a labour of love.
The production time for The Pride has proven a long process, and we've had a stumbling start which has left us in a position, for a number of reasons, where we will start afresh and relaunch the project in Late SPring/Summer 2013, with a regular release schedule and a host of amazing artists on board.
But there was so much more of the world I wanted to show; so much more for the characters to say and so many amazing artists wanting to contribute.
Thus The Pride Adventures was born!
The series will be a sister project to The Pride and will be released alongside the main series, expanding the world and characters and even introducing new ones, until a broad, inclusive and exciting new universe becomes available to our readers.
The Impact
The whole point of doing this project is to provide young LGBT comics readers with heroes they can look up to, and older ones with heroes they can relate to; it's to cover issues that straight readers may not be aware of, or may have disregarded as something which 'doesn't affect them' when they affect all of us; it can hopefully change some opinions and help push for an improvement in representation; and most of all, it will be fun!

What We Need & What You Get
The money raised by this project will be used to pay for printing this comic.
Furthermore, each donation can be used as a kind of 'pre-order' that we can show larger distributors like Diamond the kind of numbers we can achieve, so hopefully they will work with us to help distribute the comic as far and wide as possible. The other benefit of the project being on this site is that it's the best way to get your copy if you live in the United States or anywhere else outside of the UK. As yet, we are working on distribution deals in those territories, but we're not there yet. So your help will let us spread this message globally. Higher print runs and perorder numbers are of course also possible even if we don't hit the ultimate target, but the more we raise the better.
And also, due to the exchange rate, pre-ordering the comic in this way is a significant discount from retail price.
In fact, if we beat the target, then it just means we can print more, market more, and maybe even commission more artists to provide their help in the series. Anything to make this project as big and great as it can be! 
Other Ways You Can Help


Even if you can't help fund the series, you can help spread the word! There are links to the comics Facebook and twitter pages, and I'll keep this project updated on any and all news on the comic, so you can keep helping by passing that inf+o on to anyone you know and encouraging them to help us.

<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>My name is Astrid Lydia Johannsen and I've wanted to draw comics since I was old enough to take a purple marker to my mother's rocking chair. When I'm is not drawing comics, I can be found either riding my bicycle or practicing belly dance.</p>

<div>
<h3>About the Comic</h3>
<p>Absolutely True Tales of Lesbian Drama is a queer urban fantasy in an alternate history. Set in the Silk Road city of Isifni, it's the story of four flatmates who wind up finding themselves out of their element. The comic has been ongoing since 2 January 2010, updating more-or-less weekly. It can be found online at <a href=""http://lesbiandrama.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lesbiandrama.com</a>.</p>

<div>
<h3>About the Campaign</h3>
<p>I'm seeking to publish volume one of my webcomic, collecting 91 comics into a paperback tome. This book will also include director's commentary, art and sketches, and rare related works which are no longer available online. I'm striving to get this book printed in time for the Alternative Press Expo in October 2012. If my fundraising campaign succeeds, the money that I raise here will go to print a small run of 100 copies, one of which could end up in your very hands. Any more money that I receive will go to print additional copies of the book which I will have available to purchase both at APE and online at my comic site.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Contribute money if you are able. I've set up pledge perks at various increments so that you not only get the pleasure of knowing you've supported the arts, but you get some art to show for it. If you can't pledge, there are other things you can do to support my endeavor. Read my comic! Draw me some fan art! Tell your friends about my comic and fundraising campaign! My comic is nothing without my readers, so I am asking you, my readers, to help me bring my comic to you in print.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<p>Hello fellow Comicbook readers my name is Christopher Windfield and I am a artist and film maker and if you love comics that are thought provoking with a lot of action then this comic is the for you. This comic is dedicated to my cousin who actually came up with the idea years ago about a group of bad ass kids called Killers In Disguise. I took the idea and expanded on it with a deep storyline that I wrote years ago. My cousin passed away some years ago and I am doing this in lieu of his memory so completing this book is an essential goal that I must achieve. Im just looking to tell this wonderful story which I can not compare to any other storyline.</p>
<p>Contributions to this project will help fund my colorist Santosh Kumar Rath (BEEZZZ STUDIO) who has colored many exceptional works. His work can be viewed <a href=""https://beezzzstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here!</a></p>
<p>Majority of the funds will go towards the coloring process which will be 100 pages of awesomness and a small press run (print on demand) books. The entire digital copy will go up for sale once the coloring process is complete along with any perks.</p>

<p><strong>I HAVE SOME KILLER PERKS!!!</strong></p>
<p>Everyone will receive a perk! Things such as a digital download of the 1st Arc around 26 pages, artwork and printed copies fully colored!</p>

I created it over 25 years ago before ever making a dime from my art. I've completely redrawn and rewritten the whole story several times and I am happy to finally be able to present the final epic version! This first volume is 304 pages long with beautiful atmospheric artwork splashing across each page as the story dances playfully with the classic horror mythos. Just check out some of the pages!Only 500 copies of Phobos will be signed and numbered.The only reason I am able to print these high quality books is because of you. You guys have come through for each campaign and made it possible for my crazy stories to get published. You are my financiers, friends, editors, collaborators, inspiration, motivation, mentors and marketing partners. I could not have done any of this without you. I cannot thank you enough for helping me get these books made and onto coffee tables around the world.Offer your suggestions for what kinds of things you would like to see in the Goodie Bag! I am slashing the prices on all my old books for this campaign. Plus you will have access to exclusive Art books and other comics and graphic novels that I have made.You will also be able to access additional Add-ons after the campaign is finished through BackerKit.*All text and lettering is temporary until printed.Although Phobos has classic horror elements, there is no profanity, nudity or gore. It would have the movie rating of PG. The art is 95% finished. The next step is to finish all the lettering to give it a unique flavor and feel. I'll be preparing the files in InDesign while the campaign is active and my goal is to get everything to my American printer by November.This time I want to give myself some wiggle room with the schedule because I expect some delays due to Covid complications and so I am putting the fulfillment date at February of 2021. But I hope to deliver way before that time. It usually costs me about $12,000 to $15,000 to print a high quality book like this. Plus Indiegogo fees, taxes, credit card fees and refunds end up taking about 20% or more of the money raised. I also owe money to my editor, coloring assistant and letterer.And so to give myself a risk buffer (in light of Covid delays and unexpected service fees) I need to raise $25,000 to ensure that I can meet all the expectations, pay everyone involved and deliver on my promises without having to find freelance work to cover anything.If I don't reach this goal then you will be refunded and the books will not go to print. But I am confident that we can easily make this happen.We will be printing in the USA for this one and so the printing timeframe should be much quicker than my previous campaigns when I printed in China. I have selected an amazing American printer who has a great track record with high quality graphic novel production and so I know you will love what you get in the mail. Jason Brubaker worked as a professional Storyboard Artist, Animator and Visual Development Artist in Hollywood for 20 years on movies like Blade, Van Helsing, Pitch Black, and the Kung Fu Panda Trilogy.

Make poster reversible!Finished two-page spread:The Making Of EARTHWORM JIM Book!Your Earthworm Jim: Launch the Cow comic is lonely and needs a companion...The ""Making Of The Earthworm Jim Book"" is a perfect companion to the comic book. It will also be a 96 page, hardbound, 9"" x 12"" BEAST! It has a comprehensive backstory on all of the main characters and villains. I think it's tacky to have too much expository dialogue on everyone's past, so it's better to unfurl that in this book. I give you the why behind the entire Earthworm Jim universe... and yes, I'm building a universe!I recently had a reunion with the whole Earthworm Jim game team and I gotta interview everyone. We talked about how Earthworm Jim came to be and I will document that many close calls and freak accidents that had to fall into place for it to happen. There will be team bios, and a catch up on what everyone has been doing over the last 25 years since we got together.The Shiny Team section of the book has portraits of the talented artists, programmers and musician and the photos were even taken by David Perry the Earthworm Jim programmer!I'll show every step of the comic book's production, from raw ideas on the white board to printing every notecard I used in breaking down the story. You'll see the raw pencilled pages, inked pages with washes applied and I even scan my script pages that are covered in pencil re-writes!Who remembers this cartridge and packaging art by Mike Koelsch...?I've asked Mike Koelsch to paint a new ""90s-style EWJ cover"" for the Making Of book! Koelsch will give a step-by-step story on how he illustrated EWJ including a sneak peek into his studio madness. (Check out Koelsch's website here: http://www.sporkunltd.com/) He has also allowed me to make prints of the cover and the original is available on our highest backer tier. I'll put it in a beautiful frame with matting so it's ready to hang in your home!Here's Mike giving step by step progress on the cover:I've got perks where you can own the original comic pages, the book covers and enjoy frame-worthy prints plus a perk where I will draw you an original signed Earthworm Jim head-sketch in your book!The Earthworm Jim GROOVY Trading Cards are here! Every Backer gets 1 pack of 3 cards and 1 sticker with a chance to win a free original page!3 ART PRINTS!I hope to make three collectable prints with each Earthworm Jim book by guest artists, and these are the first three. Note: They will only be offered on this campaign and won't be offered on any future campaigns. The first is by Mike Koelsch, the artist who did all of the cartridge and packaging illustrations for Earthworm Jim 1 and 2. The next two are from the CreatureBox boys Greg and Dave!Click here to learn more about CreatureBox: http://creaturebox.com/New Tier: The Super-Deluxe Jim-less Original!As I was making this book, I thought it would be great for fans to be able to still get a piece of original art from the book, but at a lower price. These are beautiful, fully rendered with ink-and-wash, signed, 11"" x 17"" pages, but they don't have Earthworm Jim on them. They will still have characters like Psycrow, Princess What's Her Name, Professor Monkey for a Head and more! It comes with everything in the Earthworm Jim Signed with Headsketch tier, so we've got your books covered!Sample Page:YOU are my Plan A. There is no other plan!Making a big, beautiful book requires a lot of funding. Paper costs go up every year, and I only use top quality end sheets, cover stock and print work. It's made in America in my state so I can oversee every step of production. The book will start as a handsome hardbound edition, oversized at 9"" x 12"" and 160 pages long! It documents the origins of the super suit and how it got to earth to make our favorite hero. You'll see some familiar characters ripped straight out of the video game like: Peter Puppy, Princess What's-Her-Name, Psycrow, the hideous Professor Monkey for a Head, Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and Evil the Cat!FUND THE TEAM:The funds will go to a costly print run, my letterer Eric Weathers, flatter Radka Kavalcova, my colorist Katherine Garner, book designer Joe Potter and shipping fees. Here's a sampling of the team's test pages so far:The Art of BookmakingI've spent years making graphic novels and Earthworm Jim is probably my most well-known creation, yet his story hasn't been told. This is my chance to do the best job I can to entertain you and your backing will make this book a fantastic work of art.I don't see comics as disposable rags made to read once then toss aside. I spend a lot of time writing and story and crafting every page and merely reading some thin floppy or a PDF isn't the experience I'm going for. This book will be something you can enjoy for a lifetime, it's literature, not pop-garbage and I want to stand on the tip-toes of my ability to reach for the highest possible craft I can accomplish! My track record in this arena has few peers. I Kickstarted two sketchbook archives where we managed leather covers, gold gilded edges and the best printing money can buy. These are one-of-a-kind collector's items that are not available in stores. The book honors the backers who made them happen. I write for the most diverse audience imaginable, and the backers constantly tell me, ""I got more than I paid for!"" If you look at my books that are made outside of Indiegogo, you'll see that they don't have the over-the-top printing production I can pull off through crowd funding. Only through Indiegogo will you find foil-stamped gold cover art, UV gloss coatings, embossing and de-bossing! I hope to explore new printing techniques that make these hard bound books the kind of items you show off to your friends with a durability that ensures a great re-read for the rest of your life!Now that the $252k stretch goal has been met, 1 out of 20 of these BFB books will get a free Bigfoot Bill HEADSKETCH! For more on the Bigfoot Bill campaign click: here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/doug-tennapel-s-bigfoot-bill-graphic-novel/x/838702#/I spend a lot of time putting these books together, it's time away from my family and I've dedicated my art philosophy and have the highest commitment to being transparent to my backers, include them in every step of the process and take the moral contract between backer & creator seriously.Why Beale Air Force Base?When Crew Chief Matt Konar was allowed to choose any artist to paint the nose art on his KC135 refueling plane he wanted something like his favorite character Earthworm Jim! A friend put us in contact, and I designed the artwork for the plane and attended the commissioning ceremony on May 5th. The whole base came out and I felt so humbled to get to help America's finest that I wanted to do something special for those folks and give YOU that same feeling. By backing the Beale Air Force tier, I hope to send one copy of the Earthworm Jim comic to all 800 people on that base just in time for Christmas! As a thank you, I will send you a signed book!Here's a sample page from the comic: 
Get the Word Out:
The more you share this campaign, the more backers come in and the more we buff out the book for everyone! Please share the link, let your friends know and use the Indiegogo share tools to push this out to all of your social media outlets.Thank you! I have the best Backers in the world.
Risks & ChallengesI've had some tight deadlines in my career, and this book will be no different. I will have to pencil and ink one to two pages a day, scan them, get them off to my lettering and coloring crew where they will have to match my schedule to keep up. We're up against Christmas, a nightmare for shipping, so there could be some real delays if I can't get most of these books out to you in November. I'm in close contact with my printer and they are fast and good! Here we are at work on my last campaign:  Making of Images:Doug T production drawing of Professor Monkey-For-A-Head from the first EWJ game (1994):Princess What's-Her-Name and the Queen concept art:Legal:Earthworm Jim is a registered trademark of Interplay Entertainment Corp in the US and/or other countries. c2019 InterplayEarthworm Jim was created by Doug TenNapel.",33.0,1,"4 Campaigns
