We associate joy with the composting of organic waste. KALEA was founded to create something valuable and sustainable out of our daily food scraps. No matter where you live or how much space you have, KALEA turns your organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. In only 48 hours. NATURE AND HIGH-TECH UNITEDTechnology has made its way into every aspect of our daily life, but nobody really pays attention to the way we treat food scraps at home. Many households have no solution to dispose of food scraps in a convenient, clean, and sustainable way. This is also a global problem since organic waste accounts for up to 50% of the overall waste volume. Nature gave us the inspiration we needed to solve this problem. KALEA unites the natural composting process with smart technology to transform organic waste into nutrition-rich compost. We say: Don’t waste your waste!AS KNOWN FROMGOODBYE SMELLY GARBAGE!If you experience any of these situations, you definitely need to upgrade your kitchen routine: KALEA TAKES CARE OF ALL YOUR FOOD SCRAPSWhat’s on your chopping boards and plates? Share the leftovers with KALEA. It can handle any kind of organic waste.  A COMPOST DREAM COMES TRUEWe knew there had to be a better solution. We wanted to create a smart device that was just as good as a compost pile, but faster, more comfortable to use, hygienic, and without any unpleasant odors. More than two years of research and testing led us to the perfect solution with our unique and patent-pending technology. We are the only ones who offer a complete solution. Other products promise to create “fertilizer” - but they really only just dry and grind up waste with no biological decomposition. This output can grow mold, is not nutritious to plants, and can actually be harmful. That’s why only KALEA compost is king! JUST THREE SIMPLE STEPS TO TRANSFORM YOUR FOOD SCRAPS INTO REAL COMPOSTThere is no compost fairy. KALEA impresses with its own magic: an innovative, fully automatic technology with lots of sensors inside. Three simple steps and 48 hours is all it takes for your organic waste to turn into real nourishing compost.Step 1: Fill KALEA with your food scraps. Are you a real foodie? No worries, KALEA is designed to handle the weekly organic waste volume of a typical four-person family (appx. 2 cycles of 10 liters). Our robust shredding system processes and dries almost everything, even nutshells, and small bones! As a nice side effect, this leads to a volume reduction of 85%. When enough material accumulates, KALEA automatically processes it to the composting chamber. No odors or fruit flies — just your excitement for fresh compost. Step 2: The composting chamber of KALEA is full of sensors and has an intelligent control system. A perfect combination of temperature, humidity, and aeration wakes up the natural microorganisms inside the organic material and turns it into a land of milk and honey that accelerates the microorganisms’ metabolism. KALEA substantially reduces composting time from several months to just 48 hours. Step 3: The result? Ready-to-use compost for all your plants and flowers — indoor and outdoor. Your plants will love it since only compost contains such a full spectrum of essential plant nutrients. And if you don’t need all your compost at once, no worries, your KALEA compost can be stored for up to two years.  THE THING ABOUT COMPOSTINGPlants are living beings, and like us, they need nutrients to grow and stay healthy. So treating them with compost should be on your regular plant routine list. But be careful. In some cases, using dried organic waste (often referred to as ""fertilizer"") can also cause mold and inhibit plant growth. And no plant parent wants this. Right? KALEA compost is so rich in nutrients that it can be mixed in a 1:10 ratio.

When defied, creates a shift in our perception that transcends the impossible. Perhaps this is why we are so captivated when something disobeys it. This is PARADOX. A device that contends the all-pervasive attraction force conveyed through everything from infinitesimal particles in an atom to colossal galaxies slinging a trillion stars in the orbit of a supermassive black hole.At Matter Collection we feel a ceaseless urge to redefine what is possible. To challenge a reality constructed by the observable, the felt and heard. The future is a notion of the imaginable — or reality left to the designs of time as we shape it by will. It is the closest we can get to stopping time. PARADOX compels to be truly present by grabbing your attention as we envision tomorrow. Perpetual DesignAlways spinning when needed. PARADOX design defies not only gravity but time, no era is exclusive to its shapes and materials, it becomes a perpetual keepsake that will persist in its spellbinding maneuvers even as it is passed down through generations. GlassThe heart and soul of PARADOX. This high-transparency glass precisely unifies the ring and axis to provide impressively-long spinning duration.Brushed-finish components and the clearest possible glass reflect a lucent halo under the ellipse and radiate a soothing glow while creating the one-of-a-kind levitating illusion among the ring and axis.Cutting Edge Manufacturing Only the purest and highest-grade materials are selected in the manufacturing process of PARADOX- in combination with top-precision turning techniques to metamorphose solid blocks of metal into the body and deliver a perfect weight and size ratio essential to pull off a perfectly balanced shape, mesmerizing performance and outstanding durability.   Round flawless glass discs are accomplished by accurately cutting them. Only this process can reach the strict level of precision necessary to press-fit the glass with the metal pieces and merge them into a single gravity-defying item designed to persist time for years to come.Breathtaking finishesEach material is protected by an invisible coating that allows the metal to retain its original finish over a very long period of time.BrassBrass is a functional metal, it features mechanical properties that make it a great choice for many applications, and yet, it produces an exquisite tonality that ages beautifully, making it a great choice for aesthetic reasons alone. It's not surprising that it has captivated eyes for millennia. A classic spin on a timeless design. Stainless Steel  The most reflective of the set.

There are only four mills still operating that process wool and finish blankets in the same way. The Chatham mill, and countless others are long gone. The machinery and knowledge required is rarer and rarer. From the way the wool is dyed, through the way it is carded, spun and woven, nuances of the process determine the final product and only the few operating mills can still make 'em like they used to.</p><p>I learned everything about the wool blanket making process during this project, and that helped me to find the right mill to work with.

By the time of his death in 1920, the Chatham Blanket was world famous. For over 100 years, the Chatham Manufacturing Company made its legendary blanket until the mill shut down.This project is a revival. American-made from pure wool, using traditional manufacturing processes, we're recreating the original Chatham Blanket. The Chatham Mill in 1893The Chatham BlanketThis Indigogo will support the re-issue of a Chatham Blanket. The original blanket was manufactured in the late 1800s by the Chatham Manufacturing Mill in North Carolina. Shepherds would bring wool to the mill and receive blankets back to sell or use themselves. They were soft but durable. An incredibly versatile blanket that can stand up to years of indoor and outdoor use. WeightThe blanket is 20.5oz wool cloth. This is the same weight as WW2 army blankets, which soldiers would sleep under outside in winter. It holds in heat extremely well, while still being breathable. It also wicks away moisture. The colors are reproductions of the original dyes, using modern processes. ConstructionIt is 100% pure wool. Twill weave on a dobby loom. The finish is a perfect, soft nap, which gives it softness, and some of its insulating properties. The edges are bound with a whipstitch.The Chatham Blanket fully spread out. Size is 60X76SizeThe blanket is 60x76in. which is throw sized. It's designed to be versatile, and portable for use at outdoor events, or next to fires. DurabilityIf cared for, this wool blanket can last for generations.  Blanket Specs

The History Alexander Chatham1868: Alexander Chatham starts working as a clerk at a small water powered gristmill and installs wool carding machines in order to process local wool. The area around the mill is full of sheep and there are no woolen mills in the south. 1877: He installs weaving and finishing machines so that they can turn wool into finished goods at the mill. The first Chatham Blanket is made. The first Chatham woolen mill1890: Hugh Gwyn Chatham succeeds his father as president of the company. Hugh Gwyn Chatham1893: The mill is moved to be near a railroad so that Chatham Blankets can be more widely distributed. 1917: The company manufactures wool blankets exclusively for the US and French militaries in WW1. Their wool blankets are tested in battle.1927: Chatham Blankets are sold across the country in upscale department stores1929: Thurmond Chatham succeeds his father as president of the company.Thurmond ChathamThe Chatham Mill in the 1930sA Chatham Blanket ad from 19371941: Chatham Blankets go to war on every front, covering every branch of the military while the company's president, Thurmond Chatham, commands a cruiser in the Pacific.A soldier sleeping under an 8-111 Spec Army blanket. Chatham made millions of them in WWII.1951: In addition to blankets, Chatham manufactures wool interiors for car brands including Ford, Chrysler, Nash and Studebaker.1988: Chatham leaves family hands when it is taken over by a Danish holding company and quickly dissolved. The mill is sold a few times during the next several years and dwindles until it is completely shut down.  Research Chatham Blankets have been a part of family lore for my entire life. I have become more and more interested in them over the last several years. I started this project with the aim of reproducing an authentic Chatham Blanket, but I didn’t have any original source material to work with. I had a few vintage blankets, but I wanted to find the originals, the ones that started it all. I went through a rigorous research process to find what I was looking for. I searched libraries and museums across the US, scoured Ebay, and sent a few cold emails to try to find original Chatham blanket designs.Original archival wool watchesIn Elkin: Images of America I discovered Chatham Mill photos and decided to reach out to the author, Jason Couch. An Elkin historian whose grandparents worked at Chatham Manufacturing, Couch had a Chatham Manufacturing catalog from 1894. This was it! The catalog contained several 130 year-old pieces of wool blankets. From these original blanket swatches and some vintage photographs, I was able to reverse engineer the entire blanket designs.A late 1800s photograph of a Chatham Blanket being made.Making a Wool BlanketProducing a vintage style wool blanket in the US today is a huge challenge. There are only four mills still operating that process wool and finish blankets in the same way. The Chatham mill, and countless others are long gone. The machinery and knowledge required is rarer and rarer. From the way the wool is dyed, through the way it is carded, spun and woven, nuances of the process determine the final product and only the few operating mills can still make 'em like they used to.I learned everything about the wool blanket making process during this project, and that helped me to find the right mill to work with. I visited a few mills and studied details of the processes. I referenced Chatham archival material to correlate the current manufacturing methods of these mills with the historic processes of Chatham.The mill that I am working with has been operating in Connecticut since before the Civil War.Discussing wool fabric constructionsCarding Wool being fed into the front end of a cardThe first step in making wool blankets is called carding. The wool that arrives at the mill is shorn from the sheep and packed tight for shipping. Carding takes the wool and aligns the fibers in a single direction so that it can be twisted into yarns. American mills use Davis and Furber machines from the 1920s. Wool cards align the wool fibers into a single direction Spinning Yarn spinning frameWool comes out of the card as loose strands that aren't strong enough. They need to be rolled up, and put on a spinning frame, which twists them into yarns.  Weaving  A loom weaving wool cloth for blanketsThe entire warp is moved onto a loom where thousands of threads are hooked up individually. They are run through and the weft is woven into them. The weaving can't be too fast or the blankets won't be soft enough. Each loom can only make a certain number of feet per day in order to maintain the right tension.NappingThe napping departmentOne of the most important steps in the process is raising or napping the surface of the wool fabric. This gives it the soft, wooly surface that is a hallmark of a Chatham Blanket. FinishingThe blankets are cut, and bound with a whipstitch. The final touch is sewing on the Chatham Blanket label.  Sewing a label on a wool blanketSpecial ThanksJason CouchJon DillonJohn LitschkeMartha SmithThe town of ElkinChatham Family Members",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>Hello Pogo Mop Company</p>
<p>I am writing you my testimonial on your mop, because I am so amazed at how well this thing works.  I don’t normally write these, but can’t help myself</p>
<p>I went to my TRI Valley cleaning supply store, in Thousand Oaks, CA, to buy a broom.  But stopped by the floor cleaners they had on display.  I could not believe my eyes when I saw this simple mop and the price.  I tried it in the store, and decided to buy myself a present.</p>
<p>You see, I have a week back, and cleaning the floor is just not my thing, because my back always goes out.  I will vacuum the floor, but washing it very difficult for me.  I had purchased in the past one of the steamer type mops, but it took so long to complete the task over an hour or more and so that steamer mop does not get used and it sits in the garage collecting dust.  It is not worth the time it takes</p>
<p>I could not wait to try my new POGO mop, and as soon as I went home, I got busy.  I can’t believe how effortless it is, no bending, no scrubbing on my part, just wet that pad and go.  I have a small house and about 1K feet of tile flooring, I was done with washing that floor in less than half hour, maybe it was 20 minutes.  Since it is cordless and works on the battery that you can recharge, you just turn it on and the thing just goes.   I bought the Pogo mop with orange battery and it came with a charge, and still had lots of charge left when I was done, but I charged it up full for next time. </p>
<p>I was astonished with the ease of use, and how clean my floors came out so clean.  I had to call you, and have you explain this engineering marvel secret and how it works, because I needed to understand how it cleaned so well and I did not even work up a sweat.  </p>
<p>The ease of use is incredible,  that I washed my floors again the following week, and will continue to so each week. </p>
<p>I am embarrassed to say, prior to getting this mop, I did not wash my floors.  We vacuumed but not washed. My husband, he didn’t wash them either, he gave up after how long that steamer mop took. We just did not have the time or energy, we both work so hard</p>
<p>At first, I could not believe I spent that money, but I am so glad I did.</p>
<p>Thank you for making an amazing product, worth every bit.</p>
<p>PS:  the pads that come with the machine are amazing, thick, washable,  - just so happy with my POGO Mop</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Suzy</p>

REAL-LIFE  FEEDBACK:


Thanks for the feedback, Holly !
 
Here's another . . .

( The following is unsolicited feedback on our Generation 1 Motor Mop, the Pogo.  Like the Pogo, the new YMop Twin-Turbo incorporates our Patented, Forward-Drive, Cymatic Cleaning Technology, but is lighter, more powerful, and has a lower lay-down height. )

 
Hello Pogo Mop Company
I am writing you my testimonial on your mop, because I am so amazed at how well this thing works.  I don’t normally write these, but can’t help myself
I went to my TRI Valley cleaning supply store, in Thousand Oaks, CA, to buy a broom.  But stopped by the floor cleaners they had on display.  I could not believe my eyes when I saw this simple mop and the price.  I tried it in the store, and decided to buy myself a present.
You see, I have a week back, and cleaning the floor is just not my thing, because my back always goes out.  I will vacuum the floor, but washing it very difficult for me.  I had purchased in the past one of the steamer type mops, but it took so long to complete the task over an hour or more and so that steamer mop does not get used and it sits in the garage collecting dust.  It is not worth the time it takes
I could not wait to try my new POGO mop, and as soon as I went home, I got busy.  I can’t believe how effortless it is, no bending, no scrubbing on my part, just wet that pad and go.  I have a small house and about 1K feet of tile flooring, I was done with washing that floor in less than half hour, maybe it was 20 minutes.  Since it is cordless and works on the battery that you can recharge, you just turn it on and the thing just goes.   I bought the Pogo mop with orange battery and it came with a charge, and still had lots of charge left when I was done, but I charged it up full for next time. 
I was astonished with the ease of use, and how clean my floors came out so clean.  I had to call you, and have you explain this engineering marvel secret and how it works, because I needed to understand how it cleaned so well and I did not even work up a sweat.  
The ease of use is incredible,  that I washed my floors again the following week, and will continue to so each week. 
I am embarrassed to say, prior to getting this mop, I did not wash my floors.  We vacuumed but not washed. My husband, he didn’t wash them either, he gave up after how long that steamer mop took. We just did not have the time or energy, we both work so hard
At first, I could not believe I spent that money, but I am so glad I did.
Thank you for making an amazing product, worth every bit.
PS:  the pads that come with the machine are amazing, thick, washable,  - just so happy with my POGO Mop
Sincerely

This means no cross-contamination among your hands, your items and ACESO, allowing a 100% contactless disinfection experience. Disinfect Multiple Items Large compartment allows for multiple items to be disinfected *  (* For materials that are UV-C lights safe. Most of items that can be put under sun for a while should be safe)    You can also sanitize things like nursing and feeding products, small kid's toys, toothbrushes, electronic toothbrush heads, razor blades or anything that can fit inside the compartment and is safe for UV disinfection. 360 ° No Blind-Spot Disinfection A specially designed reflective internal compartment that not only has 360 ° UV-C coverage, but also patent pending mechanisms that drastically reduce the number of blind spots that might not get disinfected under normal circumstances of UV-C exposure, even when multiple items are put together. This includes our common key sets, something we especially wanted to sanitize effectively since microbes thrive and live longer on metal. We can't disclose the details of the mechanisms yet to protect us from infringement, but we have provided a 100% satisfaction guarantee, a no question asked, full pledge refund plus return shipping, to support all of our claims. Dual PlacementA never seen before feature by other competitor brands. ACESO is designed to have dual placement options. It can be placed on any flat surface, or hung up on the wall. Functions as a sci-fi decor piece, a classy staple by the entryway, or a practical wall-mount that holds your keys and other items.  Cordless, Portable and Universal Dual VoltageACESO is operated by a rechargeable battery, which means no more tangled cords and cables. Being cordless creates a clean and neat aesthetic, especially when ACESO is up on the wall. No more worrying about dangling power cords that run from the unit to the power outlet anymore. ACESO has universal dual voltage, it can be simply charged with any phone charger, which means no more worrying about 110v or 220v converts!On top of that, ACESO is now fully portable. You can easily place ACESO in your car and have your phone, your car keys, and other everyday carry items sanitized the moment you are back in your car. Childproof Safety 

 
During UV disinfection process, sealed and locked lid prevents any accidental opening that could cause radiation damage to your skin and eyes. UV light automatically turns off before the lid slides open, ensuring no UV light escape.
 No UV Leakage Specially designed UV protection coating and radiation shielding exterior prevents UV leakage.   Environment Friendly The main components will be built with biodegradable and recyclable materials. Additionally, our reusable and non-chemical sterilization method (UV-C) reduces waste and pollution. Decreases the amount of single-use disinfecting products that would otherwise be thrown into landfills. No Chemical Residue Many common household wipes and disinfectants contain ingredients that can harm our health. Some disinfectant chemicals can be highly irritating to our skin, eyes, and nose, or even trigger asthma, allergies and other health concerns, especially on younger kids and babies.Not only that, chemical residues found in traditional sanitizing products can also cause environmental harm at low levels and damage your items over time, as they wear down surface-level protectants. Sophisticated Design (Patents pending) : A perfect centerpiece that can easily blend in with your household decor   Wall mount and Standalone. Simply drop your items into ACESO and wave your hand at motion sensor. The lid will automatically slide close and lock to start the sanitization process. After disinfection is finished, the lid will automatically unlock and slide open, ready for you to retrieve your clean and microbe-free items.   We're looking to manufacture ACESO with

With it, you can sear, bake, or fry with unbeatable results.  No other type of pan even comes close to its performance and it lasts forever. But due to its weight, cast-iron is often overlooked in favor of less capable pans. We set out to change that.  Introducing Prepd Chef Skillet - a lighter, smoother, and more agile cast-iron. 
 By reducing the design to its simplest, most minimal form, Prepd Chef Skillet is more than 30% lighter than traditional cast-iron without compromising its unbeatable searing power. With it, you can sear, bake, fry, and even sauté - it's the ultimate everyday pan!   
Through precision machining, we completely transform the typically rough cooking surface into one that’s perfectly smooth. 

After polishing, we season the pan with 4x layers of grapeseed oil, baking each layer at high temperature for over an hour. The extra hours of polishing and seasoning result in an incredibly smooth, naturally non-stick finish — without any of the synthetic chemicals, so you can cook at high heat without any worries.

But Chef Skillet still has weight where it counts (in the base), maintaining the key advantage of cast-iron - its unbeatable searing power. Chef Skillet will become your go-to pan for everything from frying eggs to baking your favorite dessert. 
 

 

 
Prepd Chef Skillet works on any style of cooktop, from gas to induction - even the grill... or the oven!

Cast-iron has far superior heat retention and the greatest thermal mass, so it can transmit heat far beyond the surface of the pan. This results in unbeatable sears, juicy roasts, and perfectly golden bakes that no other pan can offer.
 
Prepd Chef Skillet can do the job of a roasting pan, a stainless steel skillet, and a non-stick, all in one!

  

 
We're making the Chef Skillet in both 8"" and 10"" versions. The 8"" size is ideal for making individual meals. Perfect for your weekend shakshuka brunch or treating yourself with a skillet cookie!
 

 

 
Our skillets are made with care, attention to detail, and to the highest quality. Prepd Chef Skillet is an investment that will last many generations, and better yet, it will only improve with age. Every use adds to the layers of seasoning, so your skillet will become even more non-stick the longer you use it.

No extra steps or complicated setup, iMeow can definitely make sure your fussy friends have a cozy daily routine of enough clean water. Most pet water fountains are powered by plugging into a wall power outlet, which is fine… unless there’s no plug nearby or if the power goes out! Using extension cords can be a fire and trip hazard for both you and your fussy friends, and power out situations mean no water for pets. Meet iMeow, your helpful dual-powered problem solver, which can run on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and from a power outlet.

COSMIC EYE is a spherical and kinetic sculpture that delivers beautiful infinite flow patterns with a sweep of your hand.
Filled with clear liquid and some magic particles its motion reminds of rotating galaxies or images that resemble those taken by weather satellites.
By simply moving the artwork you can create unique organic patterns that stimulate imagination and have a relaxing and captivating effect on the beholder.
 
The first of its kind.The beauty of nature and its mechanisms has always been a big source of inspiration for me — sharing this enthusiasm with others is one of my key motivations.Following the original spark of fusing engineering with art, I wanted to create a non-digital artwork which would change in time and continuously creates aesthetically pleasing visuals. I had this intuition one night that I needed to use molecules instead of mechanical parts.By crowdfunding COSMIC EYE I am able to give a wide range of people the opportunity of vividly experiencing the fascination of kinetic art.    Numerous types of use. Endless variety.You can turn or tilt, shake or flip the object, just as you like. The specially developed flow baffles inside the housing whirl up the liquid.After a few minutes, the particles sink to the ground and the chamber appears transparent.By gently moving the object horizontally you can position the air bubble. Your hand becomes the joystick in a game of particles and liquid. Another way to affect the mixture is by using a magnet. Its attraction allows for totally new patterns, such as the so called „black hole“ or „eye“ effect.So simple and yet so varied. Designed to inspire.  Built to last.The formulation of dye and particles is crucial — it was developed by myself over many years of fine-tuning. The mixture could cause, if inhaled allergy or asthma symptoms or breathing difficulties. Therefore the product robustness and tightness was a major factor during the design process. The housing is made of high-quality polycarbonate. Its strength against shock is 200 times higher than that of conventional glass. Because of this, the risk of damaging and inhalation of the particles is extremely low.   But wait, there's more!   Reward options   Meet the creatorRobert Spillner, born in Koblenz in the Rhineland region of south-western Germany, grew up with a fascination for mechanics, deeply felt already at an early childhood age.

That’s probably more than almost any other important tool in life, but we don’t think about whether our towels are really efficient.The towels we use are slow to dry, rough against our skin, not absorbent enough, and unsustainable. And they’re all the same—the market is flooded with nearly identical options!Since 2020, most of us have been spending more time at home and using our everyday household items more than ever. It’s clear that we need higher-quality household goods.It’s time for high-quality, reusable towels that get the job done while looking great. The solutionFiberologies reframes how we use our towels by focusing on each distinct routine. We believe even the tools we use in our daily chores should bring us joy, so we’ve researched and developed a single perfect towel for each task.The Fiberologies differenceFunctional: Most towels on the market are catch-all products, mass produced for general use, and not designed to work for your personal routines. Let’s get real: the towel you use for washing your face should be different from the one you use to clean up a spill. Fiberologies towels have been carefully designed to perform the jobs they’re meant for.Sustainable: Paper towels create a mountain of paper waste in the kitchen. Fiberologies towels are made using only plant-based fibers, creating a reusable alternative for all your needs.Hygienic: Traditional towels dry slowly, sealing in bacteria and creating a musty smell. Fiberologies towels are faster drying for longer freshness.Superior Quality: Many commercially sold towels are poor quality and susceptible to threading, fading, and rapid wear. Fiberologies towels are backed by the specialized Imabari industry certification, guaranteeing your towels are absorbent, durable, and free of harmful substancesMeet the towels!The ideal gentle towel to keep skin looking freshFacial skin is delicate and needs the utmost care. Many face towels are too rough and can damage skin, or aren’t structured enough to remove the oil, dirt, and grime that can build up throughout the day.The Face Washer features two different surface textures: a smooth gauze side and tightly packed terry cloth loops on the reverse. These are designed to work together to cleanse even the most sensitive skin.The Face Washer uses a cotton and bamboo fiber blend with a special thread that’s soaked in natural milk proteins. This enriches the fabric with amino acids to help promote healthy skin.No disposable wipes necessary! These towels can be washed and used again and again.Saves time by quickly drying hands after washingNobody likes the uncomfortable feeling of grabbing a mushy, moist towel after washing their hands. The Hand Dryer solves the problem with a smooth triple gauze weave that allows air to flow easily through the fabric, drying it quickly between uses.Fiberologies designed the Hand Dryer to be extra long, making it easy to reach for the whole family. A beautiful pattern woven into the towel ensures it will look great hanging in any bathroom.We selected the best super-soft 100% organic cotton threads that are non-GM and grown in India without synthetic fertilizers. Always by your side, boosting your kitchen skills, one smooth wipe at a timeThick enough for grabbing hot pans but gentle enough for drying delicate veggies, this towel is excellent for all your (literally) sticky kitchen situations!The linen and cotton blend provides the added strength and absorbency needed in the kitchen, while a naturally antimicrobial surface helps keep this towel fresher for longer.When not in use, the Chef’s Helper adds a touch of style to any kitchen with its fashionable patchwork pattern.Sustainably cleans up even the biggest spills, replacing all those paper towelsSpills happen in the kitchen, and we often end up cleaning up even small ones with a liberal wad of wasteful paper towels. The Mess Eraser provides a better solution. With a perfect blend of double thick ramie and cotton yarns woven into terry cloth ribs, this plush and extra thirsty towel soaks up even the biggest messes fast.Ramie fibers are three times more absorbent than cotton and more sustainable to farm, making this the ultimate paper towel replacement for cleaning up in the kitchen.The ribbed weave and ramie’s natural toughness give the Mess Eraser just the right amount of grit to help clean up even dried-on counter stains.Our keys to making great towelsSuperior raw materialsGreat towels start with great raw materials. We looked beyond the typical 100% cotton for our towels and created our own compositions of sustainably grown plant-based fibers for optimum performance.The right weave for the jobNot all towel weaves are equal. Each Fiberologies towel uses a specific weave selected for optimum performance.Expertly crafted in JapanAll Fiberologies towels are woven in a small factory in the famed Imabari region of Japan. For over 120 years, skilled technicians have been operating the looms there and mastering the techniques that go into today’s high-quality products. The water in this region is soft with few impurities and very little heavy metal content. This unique composition is gentle on the yarn and raw materials in Imabari towels, which brings out the natural softness of the fibers.All four of our towel designs carry the distinctive red, white and blue Imabari tag which certifies their origin and quality in five key areas.Absorbency: The “5-second test” guarantees that a towel has maximum absorbency. To pass this test, a towel must become fully saturated within five seconds of being placed in water.No Threading: Thread retention must be over 99.5 percent after washing, meaning you don’t end up with loose threads all over your home.Color Fastness: Towel dyes must resist sweat, sunlight, multiple washings, and heavy friction. This means the towels will look like new even after heavy use.Durability: The towel must withstand being pushed and pulled and have a high tensile strength. Towels that pass this test will last, even with regular daily use.No Toxic Substances: Towels are tested to make sure they’re free of inorganic substances and surface treatments such as formaldehyde.Better for the planetPlant-Based Fibers: All Fiberologies towels use only threads derived from plants, with no petroleum-based products.Conserve Water: Bamboo, ramie and flax plants all require much less water to grow than cotton, so each Fiberologies towel takes less water to produce than a 100% cotton towel.Reusable: Fiberologies towels will last wash after wash, saving you from buying new towels and reducing your consumption of disposable paper towels. Additional featuresSewn-in Hanging Loop: All our towels have a generous hanging loop securely sewn into the edge to help you store your towels and allow them to air dry after use.Signature Edges: Our signature thick edges prevent your towel from unraveling and add a unique touch of style.

You can organise your things where you want them, in a way that suits you.  Whether it's sorting stationery at your new home office or getting your kid's toys off the floor in a fun way, Geco Hub has you covered. Whatever it is, Geco Hub can hold it. Your stuff is secure with Geco Hub's adaptive rubber matrix Geco Hub's patented flexible matrix adapts to instantly and securely hold your things, whatever shape or size they are. It's quick, fun and intuitive.  What Can You Store In Geco Hub?Here's a bonus video where I demonstrate how Geco Hub can hold a wide variety of different items you might use on a regular basis.   What Sized Items Can Your Store in Geco Hub?In this bonus video recorded just before the campaign launched, Simon demonstrates just how big an item Geco Hub can hold.   Your Things, Where You Need Them, When You Need ThemGeco Hub separates your important things from the day-to-day clutter and ensures you never have to search for important stuff again.Whether it's for your:
e-book reader ? and reading glasses ? by the bed,
headphones ? and your running watch by the door ?‍♀️,
your kids' toys... so you don't stand on them) ?,
or your favourite tools for cooking up a storm in the kitchen ?,
Geco Hub keeps your important things in easy reach, so they're there where and when you need them. Remove surface clutter and keep your belongings safe Install Geco Hub wherever you find yourself reaching for stuff. Geco Hub might be small in size but not in spirit. It packs the punch of larger organisers, all whilst staying close to the wall, making it perfect for smaller living spaces. Its small size means it can fit on wall spaces other organisers just can’t too. You can mount Geco Hub to all sorts of surfaces...   Installs EffortlesslyThe thing that sucks about wall-mounted storage is mounting the damn thing on the wall in the first place! No need to worry about that with Geco Hub.Stick the optional adhesive strips onto the placeholders on Geco Hub's backboard. Geco Hub installs in minutes with strong, yet removable, adhesive strips (available as an add-on) or using the included screw fixings for something more permanent. Take off the outer tape and stick Geco Hub on the wall. Easy as 1, 2, 3. The option of using adhesive strips or screws means you can mount it to tiles, glass, brick walls, plaster walls, wooden furniture and even the side of your fridge. Wherever you want. Whatever the surface is, chances are you can fix Geco Hub to it. These optional adhesive strips won’t mark the wall either, keeping you and your landlord happy. If you want to remove them, just pull the tab down and away. They're strong too, meaning you can fill Geco Hub with up to 2.5kg/5lb of things. Use the screw fixings included with your Geco Hub to screw it to the wall. Screw fixings come with Geco Hub as standard, and adhesive strips are an optional extra. To get adhesive strips with Geco Hub just add £3 to your pledge. Remove without leaving a mark. These adhesive strips are available as an add-on.   Easy To CleanGeco Hub doesn't need cleaning any more than other wall mounted storage like shelves or cabinets. But if you do want to clean it, it's easy! You just wipe it down with a damp cloth, or remove the silicone rubber parts and put them in the dishwasher. Geco Hub's rubber parts are made from silicone rubber, the same non-stick, stain-resistant rubber used in kitchen utensils and cake tins, so you can rest assured it'll stay looking sharp for a long time.  Geco Hub in the PressWant to feature Geco Hub?

Free yourself from third-party storage networks and monthly storage subscriptions and use one secure hub for all your photos, videos and files.     
  

 

 There’s no hard drive to carry around or location-limited network access. You simply create a secure login with a one-time connection to your home WiFi network and it creates your personal cloud. All your content is stored locally on your Amber X device and accessible worldwide through AmberCloud—our own private and secure cloud service that never stores your data. It simply makes it accessible and shareable. No one but you can see your data, not even the Amber team.  When you compare Amber X to other storage solutions, we’re different where it counts: trust.  You can trust that your data’s private. You can trust there are no mandatory subscription fees. And you can trust those 2 things won’t change about us.Our friends in the digital storage space...can’t say the same. Google is discontinuing unlimited free photo storage in June 2021, leaving all their long-time users with a new monthly bill.Never sacrifice privacy for storage space again.Amber X has limitless expansion capabilities. You can mount as many SSDs or external hard drives as you need and it automatically increases your personal storage limits. Amber X also comes with 500GB of built-in storage so you can start backing up the moment you get your device!All your files are stored locally on your Amber X, but you can access them from anywhere on Earth. Just login to the Amber X mobile or desktop app and securely access your personal cloud.Wherever life takes you, Amber X is by your side.Say goodbye to phone storage anxiety and the super annoying “storage full” notification. Amber X automagically backs up and organizes your entire camera roll. You can also declutter photos from other smart devices and external drives you connect with Amber X. . In addition, Amber X’s Smart Internal Organization lets you easily find what you need. Amber X is built to expand with your 4K, 6K or 8K needs with no data limits or downgraded resolution. The internal 500GB SSD provides high-speed storage right out of the box and you always get full-resolution, no matter how many photos or videos you upload.Most cloud storage companies offer a minimal amount of free space then charge fees for additional monthly storage. No thanks!We believe you shouldn't have to “subscribe” to your own memories, let alone be concerned with sacrificing your digital privacy to store them. Simply buy your Amber X device and never pay again. There’s no annual fee for an increase in storage, simply add your own external drive and save away!Buy it once, use it forever—with no hidden fees.Amber X gives you the freedom to own your data and the flexibility to share on your terms with permission-based settings. Keep your private data private or share with those you choose, like friends, family and trusted colleagues. Your personal data is precious, so why give access to some big tech company? Traditional cloud storage services, like Google, AWS and Microsoft, rely on unsecure, third-party public services to power their backend sharing service. They have a long history of violating user privacy, and due to their centralized nature, one breach can affect millions of users.Peace of Mind with Amber X   With Amber X, your personal data is stored locally on your own device and is accessible and shareable through the secure AmberCloud. We use a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) relay service for transferring data—it goes directly from one device to another, not through a central server or third-party public cloud. This means that no one can view your data except you and those you share it with.Amber X also provides User Identity Management and Data Routing Verification to create one of the most secure environments available for consumers. This unique feature gives you an unprecedented level of security and privacy. Amber X puts all your data in one secure and accessible place in a matter of minutes. It’s just as easy as iCloud or Google Photos—only secure—and YOU OWN IT! Amber X lets you do more than just store.

Eteria means compactness, excellent performance, sustainable design, zero-waste philosophy, and cutting-edge technology,  at a fraction of the price.Eteria follows the air, in fact, it’s versatile and adaptable in terms of positioning. Eteria redefines the concept of air purifiers thanks to a diffused purification and monitoring system. Vitesy is back with a new innovative product. We know Indiegogo well and we are aware of the challenges and we are ready to face them again. Each campaign is a new adventure, we learned from our mistakes, we have grown and improved.We can’t wait to meet our new backers: some of you will be new, some will be old friends. You are the most important part of this journey, our believers and supporters. A common assumption is that, while the air outside is definitely polluted, the air we breathe inside is clean. But that’s wrong – often the air in our homes contains more contaminants than the air outside! When you cross your threshold and enter your home, you should leave the cares and worries of the modern world behind. By improving the quality of the air you breathe, you will boost every aspect of your life.Eteria is made of 2 different parts: the purifying unit and the monitoring module (the air purifier and the monitor stations). Thanks to a smart network of modules and mobile purifiers, it performs a complete mapping of your spaces to eliminate pollutants and purify every corner of your home. It’s a tailor-made solution, you can build it around you according to your needs and the number or size of the rooms. You can monitor the air quality wherever you want and always have the pollution level of every single room under control to purify it. It’s never been so easy!The purifying unit can be connected to the monitoring module through a magnetic connector. This purifying unit uses the latest generation of photocatalytic technology, more green and sustainable - thanks to powerful nanomaterials. Eteria's purification technology produces free radicals that attack pollutant molecules, breaking apart their chemical bonds, and turning them into harmless substances.The monitoring module is the heart of Eteria and has 3 high-quality sensors: temperature, humidity, and VOCs. Thanks to the LEDs it will immediately give you a hint of the air quality in the room. Your first Main Module connects to your home network via WiFi - all the extra Satellite Modules will connect to the Main Module via Bluetooth.With Vitesy Hub app, you can control the real-time data of your air quality in your homes. Eteria adapts to your needs thanks to the customisable programs. From LEDs to fan speed you can change every aspect. Select from the automatic, silence, standard, performance, custom, and timer program. 

Ask Eteria how’s the air quality in your home or office.Eteria uses a powerful cleaning technology that thanks to 2 efficient filters, can easily destroy airborne pollutants.STEP 1: There is an external pre-filter, the Advanced Fabric, that blocks large particles like particulate matter, pollen, dander, and dust. It can be simply removed and washed in the laundry.STEP 2: Then, the air is conveyed into the core of Eteria, where we find an innovative and latest generation photocatalytic filter.Traditional HEPA and activated carbon filters collect contaminants rather than destroy them. They can be spread in your home becoming a source of contamination.On the other hand, Eteria is extremely efficient thanks to its photocatalysis-based technology that uses the latest generation of nanomaterials. Our ceramic filter has a special design that maximizes the external surface and the photocatalysis efficiency accordingly. We use the latest generation modified Tungsten Trioxide (WO3) nano-coating that is activated with visible light. Eteria is ozone free and the only way to not produce toxic ozone is to use visible-band light like Eteria uniquely does. Eteria doesn’t use UV light! Ozone is a toxic pollutant that, in the lower atmosphere, isn’t directly produced by human activity, but it comes from radiation produced by photocopiers, fax, and some lamps.The attention to the environment and our green soul it’s what defines us. Photocatalysis becomes a way of connecting Eteria to our other products. We strongly want to maintain our identity and keep nature in our products.Actually, photocatalysis is a chemical reaction that mimics chlorophyll photosynthesis. Both processes absorb airborne pollutants and turn them into simple and harmless elements. Our last generation photocatalytic technology can turn into harmless substances: smoke, microbes, mold, VOCs, and in particular formaldehyde, odors, NOx, PM10, PM2.5 - PM1.0. Tests conducted by independent laboratoriesBoth Eteria’s filters don't need to be replaced because contaminants are not collected on them. On one side, you can wash the nano ceramic filter under tap water, let it dry, and then it’s ready to be used again. On the other side, the external filter can be easily washed in the washing machine. In this way, you will eliminate unnecessary waste and extra expenses. Fabric Pre-filterThanks to a very comfortable zip on the back the fabric pre-filter can be easily removed to be machine washed. It doesn't deform and doesn't undergo mechanical alternations.  
Nanomaterials ceramicThe extraction is very simple. The filter must be washed once a month under running water, left to dry, and reinserted in the purifying unit. 
Save The World with Eteria.Thanks to photocatalytic technology there aren’t extra maintenance costs because you don’t have to replace the filter every few months, as you should do with a HEPA filter. By buying Eteria you will make a sustainable and virtuous action through our planet, you just need to wash Eteria’s filters to make the difference. Every year, in fact, 20 Million of air filters are wasted, the footprint is really high. We want to make a difference, but we need your green choice to be sustainably all together.Eteria can be placed in any room as needed. If your base detects dangerous air quality values, you can move the air purifier to eliminate all harmful agents and breathe clean air.
Your perfect sous-chef: stay safe while cooking. Eteria will be there while you’re cooking your favorite dishes with your family. The kitchen is the place where we can express love for ourselves and our beloved ones through special plates we decided to cook
Your best colleague: boost your productivity.  Breathing clean and fresh air while working with Eteria, will improve your productivity and it will reduce your Sick Building Syndrome symptoms like headache, itchy nose, breathing problems, and more.
Your sentinel while sleeping: sleep better. We spend almost one-third of our life sleeping. It’s extremely important that you rest properly and wake up every morning full of energy. Eteria will take care of your sleep by removing pollutants like benzene and formaldehyde.When the air purifier meets the design.

People tend not to buy products that take up so much space. Eteria will improve the quality of your life as it’s designed to occupy as little space as possible without sacrificing performance. This is why we created Eteria: to give freedom to your space.With Eteria we have removed all the possible distractions: no display with incomprehensible information or anything else. The information about air quality is communicated via a simple light interface on the monitoring base.   The furnishings of modern homes and offices are increasingly minimalist. Eteria, being designed to live in harmony with the spaces and the people who live there, marries this minimalist philosophy. Your support is the most important part of our journey. The funds we receive from this campaign will be directed to the production of Eteria, to our manufacturers and suppliers, but also to do further tests, in order to offer you the best service and product. Outside the Indiegogo campaign it will not be possible to request a refund. In the Indiegogo community, the product you receive for your pledge is a reward for our appreciation. If you feel like the item you received offers no value to you here are some suggestions of what you can do with it in the spirit of crowdfunding: 
Give your Eteria to a friend or a family member. It would be a wonderful gift.
Sell it. Maybe another user would love to buy it.
If your product doesn’t work at its best, we are here to give you the best support possible. Please remember that we started from zero and we are working hard to improve your experience every day.
When you pre-order Eteria the shipping costs are included. But each country is different and has different customs laws.Please also note that Vitesy does not have any control over these charges. While we do everything on our side to limit customs charges, ultimately backers are responsible for clearing customs. Customs policies vary widely, so please contact your local customs office if you would like any further information.We started our partnership with Eden Reforestation Projects back in 2016 and we are happy to continue to work together with Eteria too. In fact, for every product sold we plant 10 mangroves in Madagascar. Until now we planted over 75k trees! Together, we contribute to save the planet.",65.0,1,"4 Campaigns

Wait for it to load.  The intelligent s•pot provides ideal conditions for your plants to thrive, making it the sustainable, sophisticated, and innovative choice for proven brown thumbers and anyone looking to take that first step into indoor gardening.    Samsung, a world leader in advanced digital component solutions, developed the full-spectrum horticulture lighting technology, which we have equipped the s•pot with that allows this pot to cultivate plants indoors at any time in any climate.  Plant growth comparison test according to spectrum.   Compared to traditional LED lighting, Samsung’s full-spectrum-based LEDs promote healthier and more balanced plant growth by activating photosynthesis, enhancing plant immunity, and increasing nutritional value. The full-spectrum treatments outperformed the narrow ones by consistently showing healthier growth under full-spectrum lighting.    The water from the water tank is delivered straight to the roots of the plant. The Jiffy Pot absorbs water from the wick of the water supply and the plant absorbs the right amount of water from the Jiffy Pot.   In addition, the large-capacity water tank has a large opening, so watering and cleaning are very easy.   This is a video of planting sweet basil seeds in 's•pot' and growing them for 35 days. It was filmed in a dark office. Water was replenished once.   There is a right way to water your plants: our self-watering technology provides your plant with just the right amount of water, straight to the roots. Low maintenance for you, superior care for your plants.  The water tank stores up to 8.5oz (250ml) of water. Once the water tank is filled, it automatically supplies water to plants for up to 10 days.(The maximum water supply period may vary depending on the type, size, and environmental conditions of the plant.)      Bloomengine s•pot is designed to provide users with a New Indoor Gardening Experience by carefully selecting advanced technology and lasting materials. We want you to experience the awe of witnessing the marriage between powerful technology and beautiful design.  The sleek, modern design along with a matte black finish transforms your greenery into works of art and elevates the ambiance in any bedroom, living room, or other space of your choice.  Grow many plants & herbs of your choice.※ Recommended size: plants sold in pots of 4-5 inches in diameter, which are common and popular in the market. (Plants/seeds/soil are not included in the s•pot package and must be acquired separately.) These are some examples of plants. You can grow many more types of plants.  Whether you’re looking to grow some mint for your nightcap cocktails or some basil for your next pasta dish, the s∙pot can grow it all and more!   The lighting's height and intensity can be adjusted to provide the right amount of luminosity for each plant.
 Brightness levels per plant type: 100% recommended for herbs and succulents, 50% for foliage plants.
The light settings may differ depending on the plant type, size, and indoor environment. 
   The s•pot’s U-frame adds functionality to your window, wall, or ceiling by turning it into a space for growing plants. Its unique design allows for easy transportation and portability. It also facilitates growing trailing plants indoors by using a wall hook.    The s•pot is designed to be sustainable and long-lasting. The materials are recyclable and eco-friendly structures (BPA-free Polypropylene, Steel, No glue, Minimum use of screws).  You can connect multiple s•pots to one power source. Connect up to six s•pots by using a USB-C power adapter, three for a USB-A power adapter, and one to a PC.     One s•pot can be connected to the USB port of a PC or notebook.    Up to 3 s•pots can be connected to the USB-A type power adapter.     Up to 6 s•pots can be connected to the USB-C type power adapter. The power adapter must support PD and be connected to the optional timer.       Compared to traditional flowerpots and smart planters in the existing market, s•pot is superior in function, design, and ease of use.        Each box comes with the following: U-frame × 1, Body × 1, Water Tank × 1, Horticulture LED Light × 1, Watering Holder+Wick × 1, Jiffy Pot × 1, USB-C to C Cable × 1, User Manual × 1

<p>Ranked 22nd on the periodical table, titanium is one of the hardest metals to manufacture, due to its uncompromising strength and stability. With a melting point of roughly 3,034°F (1,668°C) and a boiling point of 5,949°F (3,287°C), titanium has excellent corrosion resistance and a high strength to weight ratio.</p>
<p>For centuries, dining tables of both the east and the west have used all kinds of precious metals and other types of materials to craft the delicate tools we eat with. Cutlery has become one of the most essential icons of human civilization. Yet it is less known that with each mouthful of food that we consume — we equally consume about 100 billion atoms of the metal, making our cutlery truly part of what we eat. ?</p>

<p>According to The Telegraph and Financial Times, the material of our cutlery significantly affects the taste of our food.</p>
<p>The idea of a meal as a multi-sensory experience is nothing new; what is recent is the science that’s illuminating the complexity of our perceptions.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Guardian, Laughlin said: ""We realized there hasn’t been much research into the taste of different metals, but it really affects how food tastes. If a metal makes something taste sweeter, or richer, then there’s potential to reduce the sugar content in the food itself.”</p>
<p>Thanks to titanium's stable, non-allergenic and chemical resistant properties, preventing the non-desired nano chemical reactions between food and our taste buds and suppressing the growth of bacteria. You can enjoy the very original and natural taste of food without any interference. This is eating as it should be - you just taste the flavor of the food and nothing else.<br/> </p>

<p>Titanium has been called the luxury metal of the future, one that sculptors, architects, scientists, designers, and jewelry-makers have praised for its strength and beauty. Named by the German chemist M.H. Klaproth in 1793 after the Titans of Greek mythology; titanium means the “the incarnation of natural strength.”<br/> </p>

<p>Dubbed as the 9th most abundant element on earth, it is only in the most recent decades, did human kind start to discover some of the many unique properties of this true wonder metal.<br/> </p>
<h3>Anti-Bacterial and Chemical Resistant<br/> </h3>
<p>When titanium is exposed in air, a very thin layer of titanium atoms will interact with the oxygen to create a nano coating of TiO2 (titanium dioxide), also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania. Titania (TiO2) - based nanocomposites subjected to light excitation are remarkably effective in repelling microbial growth. Making your food not only safer to eat, but tastes fresher and better.<br/> </p>

<h3>Medical Grade Pure Titanium:<br/>It could become an Extension of your Body<br/> </h3>
<p>Ensō is made of the same grade pure titanium that medical surgeons and dentists use for body and oral implants. This is because titanium is literally hypoallergenic, which means it’s safe for all people with no risk of allergic reactions. Ever remember the weird taste of stainless steel or the irritation caused by your metal jewelry? No need to worry anymore — titanium is completely tasteless and hypoallergenic, it’s almost like a natural part of you.<br/> </p>

<h3>Anti-Corrosion, Chemical Resistant, Virtually Indestructible</h3>
<p><br/>Titanium has such a low corrosion rate that after 4000 years in seawater, only less than 1 millimeter of its surface will be penetrated.</p>

<h3>Ensō's Unique Titanium Ion Implantation Technology:<br/>Extra Durability, Suface Hardness and Strength</h3>
<p><br/>Unlike most titanium cutlery products on the market today, Ensō collection is treated with our unique state-of-the-art ion implantation process. In the ion implantation process, titanium ions, are implanted into the surface of the components to modify the surface structure and composition. The ions are projected towards the surface in a high energy beam which penetrates the surface leaving a denser nano zone. The process does not require heating the component as the ions penetrate using the kinetic energy of the beam.<br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1542669344/jspkp2jwayfehmxfnt1w.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>

<p>Titanium Ion Implantation is a low-temperature nano level process by which ions of titanium are accelerated into pre-manufactured Ensō flatware surface, filling up gaps and correcting misalignment, thereby doubling it’s surface strength and durability.</p>
<p>The advantages of the process are that there is no distinct coating layer of the risk of delamination. No change in dimensions and none of the risks of carrying out elevated temperature treatments. The process is performed under high vacuum and can be carried out selectively on the wear surfaces of components. Ion implantation is used in biomedical applications for replacement joints and other titanium prostheses.</p>

</div></div>","Ensō is a collection of slim, ultra-light and durable titanium cutlery sets. After months of design, research and prototyping, we've proven that it’s possible to make great everyday pure titanium products without compromising the aesthetics and functionalities. Ensō Collection is a cutlery masterpiece made by Ti22 team, previously known by our Therma and Via thermos bottles. Ensō was created to redefine modern dining experience, promoting healthier eating and eco-sustainability, while impressing your guests.

It is long known to fine craftsmen and designers, that titanium is an exceptionally hard metal to work with, due to its high strength, high melting point, and high chemical resistance properties.

Anti-Bacterial, Non-Corrosive, Hypoallergenic. Made with highest-quality pure medical grade titanium, Ensō brings the experience of fine dining to your table.
Ensō cutlery is like no other – in order to create a cutlery design that not only manifests titanium's strength and hardness but also its beauty and timelessness, we developed a manufacturing process that's never been attempted before in the history of titanium cutlery production.First, raw pure titanium blocks are cut to its basic forms. Then we use 10 times hydraulic pressing of 250 tons of weight to define the lines and curves. During that process, 6 times of extreme heating and cooling was deployed to maximize Ensō's strength and formability. Once the shape is formed, we then use high precision CNC machining to polish and refine the details, to a precision of 0.02mm. The 'suspension bridge' design is a unique design feature that could have only been made possible with our precision machined titanium technology. Multiple times of fine polishing is then applied to give Ensō Edition's elegant, fine mirror finish; before the ion implantation process is used to further enhance the surface hardness of each piece.
From the maker of hugely successful Therma & Via titanium bottles, Ensō cutlery set is made with the same pure high-end titanium. Ensō is inspired by zen art and architecture, manufactured with 0.02mm precision and is incredibly lightweight. It looks stunningly luxurious. The moment you hold Ensō in your hands, your fine dining experience will be redefined forever.
 
 
 
 
 
In order to balance aesthetics, usability, and affordability, our team has come up with two awesome designs for the Ensō Collection – Ensō & Ensō Edition. Both designs use the same highest quality pure titanium, with state-of-the-art design and Titanium Ion Implantation Technology to greatly enhance its antibacterial and anti-corrosion properties. 
 



  
Unique to Ensō, Ensō Edition has an unprecedented high-end glossy finish, which is incredibly difficult to achieve for titanium. Ensō Edition also has some unique design details such as the ultra-slim “suspension link” design, and it's refined long handles. Both Ensō and Ensō Edition are designed for long-lasting day to day use, and their breathtaking form is designed to impress your guests. (Ensō Edition will be available once we reach $120K. Back us now and you will be able to upgrade to Ensō Edition at its super early bird pricing!) 
 
   


 
 
 
 
 
 
At Ti22, we designed Ensō with a global audience in mind. Apart from the classical four-piece set that is essential for the Western dining tables, we’ve also added elegant chopsticks paired with a stand. 
 
 
 
 
Both Ensō and Ensō Edition come with elegant chopstick rests designed to complement your dining etiquette while maintaining hygiene. The chopstick rest of Ensō Edition also functions as an innovative chopsticks holder to help you organize. 
 
 
 
 
Ranked 22nd on the periodical table, titanium is one of the hardest metals to manufacture, due to its uncompromising strength and stability. With a melting point of roughly 3,034°F (1,668°C) and a boiling point of 5,949°F (3,287°C), titanium has excellent corrosion resistance and a high strength to weight ratio.
For centuries, dining tables of both the east and the west have used all kinds of precious metals and other types of materials to craft the delicate tools we eat with. Cutlery has become one of the most essential icons of human civilization. Yet it is less known that with each mouthful of food that we consume — we equally consume about 100 billion atoms of the metal, making our cutlery truly part of what we eat. ?
 
 
 
 
According to The Telegraph and Financial Times, the material of our cutlery significantly affects the taste of our food.
The idea of a meal as a multi-sensory experience is nothing new; what is recent is the science that’s illuminating the complexity of our perceptions.
Speaking to The Guardian, Laughlin said: ""We realized there hasn’t been much research into the taste of different metals, but it really affects how food tastes. If a metal makes something taste sweeter, or richer, then there’s potential to reduce the sugar content in the food itself.”
Thanks to titanium's stable, non-allergenic and chemical resistant properties, preventing the non-desired nano chemical reactions between food and our taste buds and suppressing the growth of bacteria. You can enjoy the very original and natural taste of food without any interference. This is eating as it should be - you just taste the flavor of the food and nothing else. 
 
 
 
Titanium has been called the luxury metal of the future, one that sculptors, architects, scientists, designers, and jewelry-makers have praised for its strength and beauty. Named by the German chemist M.H. Klaproth in 1793 after the Titans of Greek mythology; titanium means the “the incarnation of natural strength.” 
 
 
Dubbed as the 9th most abundant element on earth, it is only in the most recent decades, did human kind start to discover some of the many unique properties of this true wonder metal. 
Anti-Bacterial and Chemical Resistant 
When titanium is exposed in air, a very thin layer of titanium atoms will interact with the oxygen to create a nano coating of TiO2 (titanium dioxide), also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania. Titania (TiO2) - based nanocomposites subjected to light excitation are remarkably effective in repelling microbial growth. Making your food not only safer to eat, but tastes fresher and better. 
 
 
Medical Grade Pure Titanium:It could become an Extension of your Body 
Ensō is made of the same grade pure titanium that medical surgeons and dentists use for body and oral implants. This is because titanium is literally hypoallergenic, which means it’s safe for all people with no risk of allergic reactions. Ever remember the weird taste of stainless steel or the irritation caused by your metal jewelry? No need to worry anymore — titanium is completely tasteless and hypoallergenic, it’s almost like a natural part of you. 
 
 
Anti-Corrosion, Chemical Resistant, Virtually Indestructible
Titanium has such a low corrosion rate that after 4000 years in seawater, only less than 1 millimeter of its surface will be penetrated.
 
 
It can withstand extreme heat and cold, up to 3,034°F
as opposed to 1,221°F that of aluminium. 
 
 
 
Ensō's Unique Titanium Ion Implantation Technology:Extra Durability, Suface Hardness and Strength
Unlike most titanium cutlery products on the market today, Ensō collection is treated with our unique state-of-the-art ion implantation process. In the ion implantation process, titanium ions, are implanted into the surface of the components to modify the surface structure and composition. The ions are projected towards the surface in a high energy beam which penetrates the surface leaving a denser nano zone. The process does not require heating the component as the ions penetrate using the kinetic energy of the beam.
 
 

 
Titanium Ion Implantation is a low-temperature nano level process by which ions of titanium are accelerated into pre-manufactured Ensō flatware surface, filling up gaps and correcting misalignment, thereby doubling it’s surface strength and durability.
The advantages of the process are that there is no distinct coating layer of the risk of delamination. No change in dimensions and none of the risks of carrying out elevated temperature treatments. The process is performed under high vacuum and can be carried out selectively on the wear surfaces of components. Ion implantation is used in biomedical applications for replacement joints and other titanium prostheses.
 
 
 
 
At Ti22, we adopted this cutting-edge technology to enhance the durability and strength of our Ensō cutlery sets, making them incredibly strong yet stunningly beautiful.
 
 
 
Another benefit of Titanium Ion Implantation is to help Ensō significantly reduce the risk of leaving metal marks on the surface layer of ceramic glazing, which is a common problem for many softer metals such as silver, copper and stainless steel.
 
 
 
In order to achieve Ensō's ultra-smooth surface finishing, we deployed up to six cycles of fine polishing throughout the manufacturing process, with heat treatments in between to give it unique strength and reliability.

Titanium also has a low heat transfer rate. Much lower than many grades of stainless steel, and definitely lower than your traditional cutlery set. With Enso, not only does it feel comfortable in your hand, but also prevents you from getting burned. If you use an Enso spoon for your next cup of coffee, say goodbye to the worry of hot fingers.
 
 
 
 
Improved vacuum and sports bottles from Ti22 previous campaign
 
At Ti22, not only are we creating new products for you, we are constantly improving our existing products. Since the original launch of Therma – world's first titanium vacuum thermos bottle, we have taken valuable user feedback and significantly improved them. With the launch of Ensō, we are also announcing the new and improved Therma 450ml and Via 800ml.
 
 
 
 
With the new and improved Via 800ml, we've also developed a brand new food grade thermal plastic sports lid that has a built-in straw – made for outdoor use. We are including the extra lid with every new Via 800ml we ship! 
Therma 450ml with the improved lid design now keeps heat and cold for as long as 12 hours — almost twice as long as the previous generation. 
 
 
 
 

 
You asked; we listened! To double up Ensō cutlery collection's environmental friendliness, we have added a new piece to the collection: Ensō Pure Titanium Straw.
Made with same medical grade pure titanium, Ensō straw helps you go completely plastic-free when you dine.

The biggest risk you can take is to take no risks at all. And we at WooBloo took many. Since we are strong believers in the prosperous future of WooBloo, now and in the past, we took some big leaps of faith. Many worked out great and many did not. After the process, we learned that the key to bootstrapping a business is to balance the risks with your cash flow and your access to emergency money. We’ve been lucky with our own fund availability and have utilized that to move successfully from a concept to a fully working prototype. Concept to Prototype with Partner SupportThis was a big learning phase for everybody in the team. It took eight months to get Amazon to agree to partner with WooBloo so we can offer Amazon Alexa built-in capability in a seamless manner. Parallelly, we had to get the hardware OEM’s like Rock Chip, Texas Instruments, and Young Optics to partner with WooBloo, so we could offer a high-quality and reliable product. These partnerships made it even harder with limited volume commitment capabilities.In spite of challenges, we created our 1st 3D printed working model device with off-the-shelf components. This was the most challenging, yet enjoyable, six months that we spent; we completed hundreds of design iterations and bought components that needed putting together. And finally, we bring you SMASH-a smart home projector with features you’ve never seen before.Technology:

Thank you all for your invaluable feedback and support!</p><p>But first, let us take a closer look at what makes our STUR Skillet the right choice for your kitchen.</p><p><strong>Here are 9 solid reasons for you to consider:</strong><br/> </p><h2>1. A Skillet for the Ages</h2><div data-id=""31160172""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media2.giphy.com/media/bWmIir1OfIoF4d4EkH/source.gif"" src=""""/><br/><br/>Amazingly durable: The STUR Skillet is produced in Germany from <span><strong>one piece of cast iron.</strong> </span>Cast with the highest precision and machined on the bottom as well as the inside, its robust material resists heat deformation and won’t leave you gripping a wobbly handle.<br/> </p></figure></div><h2>2. Non-Stick by Nature</h2><div data-id=""31160237""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media2.giphy.com/media/Zl4j2WeSx5WOauXXWO/source.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><br/>Our skillets <strong><span>come polished and “seasoned”</span></strong>. In other words, we first use computer-controlled machines to smooth their cooking surface and then bake on layers of natural grape-seed oil.</p><p>The fine surface structure and oil layer (commonly referred to as “seasoning”) provide our skillets with their <strong><span>non-stick quality</span></strong> while<span> <strong>avoiding the chemicals</strong></span> otherwise used to achieve this effect. The same seasoning also protects our STUR Skillet against rust.</p><p>Should you ever be unsatisfied with your skillet’s non-stick abilities, <strong><span>you can simply re-season it yourself</span></strong>. No worries, we will show you how in our complimentary video demonstrations.<br/> </p><h2>3. The Perfect Tool to Achieve the Perfect Crust</h2><div data-id=""30415631""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/415/631/aa8150a38ac7817d34d0f834c67f08bc_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1598887219&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=43b05cd914a107af3b707bb9c6d063b0"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><br/>Cast iron is known to store a lot of heat, thus making our cast-iron STUR Skillet the perfect cooking tool to give your food the <span><strong>desired amount of crust and browning</strong>.</span></p><p>Basically, the stored heat makes the water in the food evaporate quicker, while also creating <strong><span>deeply satisfying umami flavors</span></strong>. Yum!<br/> </p><h2>4. Made in Germany</h2><div data-id=""31000938""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1606181739/grbwd7k0zdwwtw5frusi.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><br/>We are proud to say that our skillets are 100% <span>Made in Germany</span>. Working in close collaboration with specialized partners, we are able to combine traditional methods of production with high-tech manufacturing.</p><p>You may like the fact that our foundry, <span>Gienanth</span>, primarily supplies high-precision engine parts for German premium brand cars. (Legend has it they cast the engine of Bugatti’s first race car). The STUR Skillet offers further proof that <span><strong>outstanding products can still be produced locally</strong>.</span><br/> </p><h2>5. The Right Weight</h2><div data-id=""31160508""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media0.giphy.com/media/l8Suqi9OuWfu7ohbpK/source.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><br/>A long-lasting skillet requires a certain weight. Thin skillets quickly deform when exposed to high temperatures and are no longer able to transfer heat evenly. When designing the STUR Skillet, we made sure to reduce weight where possible, but decided to keep material where necessary.</p><p>Imagine an instrument, <strong><span>fine-tuned to cook up some great steaks (or vegetables for that matter).</span></strong> Weighing in at 5.3 lb, our 11-inch skillet is lighter than most other cast-iron versions available on the market and primed to turn each cooking session into an <span><strong>uplifting experience</strong>.</span><br/> </p><h2>6. An Ergonomic Handle</h2><div data-id=""31063103""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1606181740/hz1pnf1b9ogvubiqqamc.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><br/>You’d better believe we experimented with countless different handles during the design process. We also collected feedback from within our community on the numerous prototypes.</p><p>Finally, we came up with a minimalistic and ‘grippable’ design for <span><strong>easy handling</strong>. </span>The main handle is fitted with a hole for convenient hanging or storing when not in use, while the helper handle facilitates <strong><span>safe carrying</span></strong>–even with kitchen towels or gloves.<br/> </p><h2>7. One for All Cooktops </h2><div data-id=""30426126""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media4.giphy.com/media/krtB4kaMS8tCkzKL3L/source.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><br/>Be it gas, electric or induction, the STUR Skillet performs on all cooktops. Its thicker bottom allows for even heat distribution. You can even place your STUR Skillet <strong><span>right on the barbecue</span></strong>.

Tausend Dank für Eure Unterstützung – ohne Euch wäre die STUR-Pfanne nicht das, was sie jetzt ist.</p><p><strong><span>9 Gründe, sich für unsere STUR-Pfanne zu entscheiden:</span></strong><br/> </p><h2>
<span>1.</span> <span>Eine Pfanne für die Ewigkeit</span>
</h2><div data-id=""31160315""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media2.giphy.com/media/bWmIir1OfIoF4d4EkH/source.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><br/>Extrem <strong><span>langlebig</span></strong> und äußerst <strong><span>hitzebeständig</span></strong>: Jede STUR-Pfanne wird in Deutschland hergestellt und aus einem Stück gegossen. Anschließend werden Boden und Innenseite der Pfanne mit höchster Präzision geglättet. Kein wackliger Griff, stabiler Halt und kein Verformen unter Hitzeeinwirkung – eine Pfanne, die für so gut wie jede Kochaktion zu haben ist.<br/> </p><h2>2. Kein Ankleben von Speisen</h2><div data-id=""31160423""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media2.giphy.com/media/Zl4j2WeSx5WOauXXWO/source.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><br/>Bereits im Werk <strong><span>abgedreht</span></strong> und <strong><span>eingebrannt</span></strong>: Bitte was? Dank modernster Computertechnik können wir das raue Gusseisen unserer Pfannen so bearbeiten – <span>abdrehen</span>, um genau zu sein – dass eine feine Oberflächenstruktur entsteht. Danach werden mehrere Schichten aus natürlichem Traubenkernöl aufgetragen und auf die Pfanne gebacken. Deine STUR-Pfanne ist also sofort einsatzbereit.</p><p>Die Kombination dieser Prozesse verleiht unseren Pfannen ihre hervorragenden Antihafteigenschaften, die bei richtiger Handhabung an handelsübliche, PTFE-beschichtete Pfannen herankommen. Und das ohne den Einsatz künstlicher Beschichtungen oder Chemikalien.</p><p>Das Einbrennen schützt die Pfanne außerdem vor Rost. Solltest Du einmal das Gefühl haben, dass die Antihafteigenschaft Deiner Pfanne nachgelassen hat, kannst Du die Ölschicht übrigens jederzeit selbst erneuern. Wie? Das zeigen wir Dir in unserem STUR-Videokurs, der für alle Kampagnen-Unterstützer kostenlos ist.<br/> </p><h2>3.

Deshalb ist die STUR-Gusseisenpfanne perfekt dazu geeignet, Deinen Gerichten den richtigen Grad an Bräunung und Knusprigkeit zu geben – ganz gleich ob Fisch, Fleisch oder Gemüse.</p><p>Mit anderen Worten, sorgt die gespeicherte Wärmeenergie im Gusseisen dafür, dass das Wasser im Bratgut schneller verdampft und erzeugt zugleich intensive Umami-Röstaromen. Einfach köstlich!<br/> </p><h2><span>4.

Bis in die 70er-Jahre produzierten sie auch schon eigene Gusseisenpfannen.</p><p>Dieses Wissen und diese <span><strong>Leidenschaft für Präzision</strong> </span>fließen mit jedem Guss in unsere STUR-Pfannen. Das macht uns besonders stolz und ist ein weiterer Beweis dafür, dass herausragende und hochwertige Produkte noch immer hierzulande, <strong><span>lokal gefertigt</span></strong> werden können.<br/> </p><h2>

Denn zu dünne Pfannen neigen dazu, sich unter Hitzeeinwirkung zu wölben und heizen infolgedessen nicht mehr gleichmäßig auf.</p><p>Bei unserer STUR-Pfanne haben wir Material entfernt, wo möglich, und verstärkt, wo nötig. Mit 2,4 kg ist unsere 28-cm-Pfanne weitaus leichter als traditionelle Gusseisenpfannen, aber genauso robust und hat somit genau das richtige Gewicht für den täglichen Gebrauch.<br/> </p><h2>

Zusätzlich garantiert der Gegengriff ein sicheres Tragen der vollen Pfanne – selbst mit Topflappen oder Ofenhandschuhen.</p><p>Und solltest Du Dich jetzt noch fragen, ob der Griff nicht vielleicht zu lang ist, bestätigen wir Dir gerne, dass beide Pfannengrößen <strong>problemlos in jeden Standardbackofen passen</strong>.<br/> </p><h2>7<span>.</span> <span>Für</span> jede Herdart geeignet </h2><div data-id=""30426126""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/426/126/391b38d94dd7e435d509e837b00b52bc_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1598946666&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=56b09ea4e97675920b890378bbe542a0"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><br/>Ob <strong><span>Ceran</span></strong>, <strong><span>Elektro</span></strong>, <strong><span>Gas</span></strong> oder <strong><span>Induktion</span></strong> – unsere STUR-Pfanne ist auf jedem Herd zuhause.

Dort kann unter anderem auch per Banküberweisung (Vorkasse), Sofortüberweisung, Giropay oder eps-Überweisung bezahlt werden.The STUR Skillet is a cast-iron skillet designed for the 21st century: lighter, smoother yet with the same STURdiness as traditional cast iron. Built for everyday cooking and made to last.  Developing this skillet was a collective effort, made possible with the help of more than 12,000 cooking enthusiasts from our STUR community. Thank you all for your invaluable feedback and support!But first, let us take a closer look at what makes our STUR Skillet the right choice for your kitchen.Here are 9 solid reasons for you to consider: 1. A Skillet for the AgesAmazingly durable: The STUR Skillet is produced in Germany from one piece of cast iron. Cast with the highest precision and machined on the bottom as well as the inside, its robust material resists heat deformation and won’t leave you gripping a wobbly handle. 2. Non-Stick by NatureOur skillets come polished and “seasoned”. In other words, we first use computer-controlled machines to smooth their cooking surface and then bake on layers of natural grape-seed oil.The fine surface structure and oil layer (commonly referred to as “seasoning”) provide our skillets with their non-stick quality while avoiding the chemicals otherwise used to achieve this effect. The same seasoning also protects our STUR Skillet against rust.Should you ever be unsatisfied with your skillet’s non-stick abilities, you can simply re-season it yourself. No worries, we will show you how in our complimentary video demonstrations. 3. The Perfect Tool to Achieve the Perfect CrustCast iron is known to store a lot of heat, thus making our cast-iron STUR Skillet the perfect cooking tool to give your food the desired amount of crust and browning.Basically, the stored heat makes the water in the food evaporate quicker, while also creating deeply satisfying umami flavors. Yum! 4. Made in GermanyWe are proud to say that our skillets are 100% Made in Germany. Working in close collaboration with specialized partners, we are able to combine traditional methods of production with high-tech manufacturing.You may like the fact that our foundry, Gienanth, primarily supplies high-precision engine parts for German premium brand cars. (Legend has it they cast the engine of Bugatti’s first race car). The STUR Skillet offers further proof that outstanding products can still be produced locally. 5. The Right WeightA long-lasting skillet requires a certain weight. Thin skillets quickly deform when exposed to high temperatures and are no longer able to transfer heat evenly. When designing the STUR Skillet, we made sure to reduce weight where possible, but decided to keep material where necessary.Imagine an instrument, fine-tuned to cook up some great steaks (or vegetables for that matter). Weighing in at 5.3 lb, our 11-inch skillet is lighter than most other cast-iron versions available on the market and primed to turn each cooking session into an uplifting experience. 6. An Ergonomic HandleYou’d better believe we experimented with countless different handles during the design process. We also collected feedback from within our community on the numerous prototypes.Finally, we came up with a minimalistic and ‘grippable’ design for easy handling. The main handle is fitted with a hole for convenient hanging or storing when not in use, while the helper handle facilitates safe carrying–even with kitchen towels or gloves. 7. One for All Cooktops Be it gas, electric or induction, the STUR Skillet performs on all cooktops. Its thicker bottom allows for even heat distribution. You can even place your STUR Skillet right on the barbecue. Just an idea…  8. Not Just for Meat Lovers Suited for more than just steaks and schnitzel, the STUR Skillet’s heat-storing capacity also lets you prepare crunchy vegetables and perfectly browned mushrooms.Lighter skillets generally do not store enough energy, usually steaming vegetables more than they actually color them. Rest assured, once you’ve tried mushrooms, asparagus, or pan-fried potatoes cooked this way, there’ll be no going back. Hungry yet? 9. Complimentary ‘How-To’ Videos Cast-iron skillets do have some attributes that require special care. That being said, when you back our campaign, you receive access to our free, educational video demonstrations on topics such as: What’s more, Simon will gladly share some personal cooking tips and tricks from his time working at a Michelin-star restaurant (currently ranked at #15 of the best restaurants in the world). How does the STUR Skillet compare?We genuinely put a lot of thought into our skillet, right down to the smallest detail. 7+ years of experience from reviewing skillets and working in professional kitchens went into the process. With our STUR community involved and contributing to every important design step along the way, the STUR Skillet is just as much yours as it is ours.Now, please help us bring this masterpiece of cookware to your kitchen, by backing our campaign! The Perks Most backers will fare well with the 11-inch skillet. It is large enough to fit bigger portions, but can also be used for smaller meals.Our 9.5-inch skillet, on the other hand, is just the right size for smaller portions or preparing a side dish. We would recommend you get the two-piece set for more options. That way you will be able to prepare a main dish in the 11-inch skillet and simultaneously ready a side dish in the 9.5-inch one. Think rib-eye steak and chanterelle mushrooms, for instance!Add-OnsTo further enhance your STUR cooking experience we devised some additional accessories to go with our skillets: We asked the Lasch & Prillwitz design studio to help us design a handle cover, made from high-quality leather and produced in Germany. The cover will let you grab a hot skillet from the oven or the stove. It slides on and off easily, while ensuring a safe grip. Plus, the leather will develop a beautiful patina with time. Our slotted spatula is also made in Germany (of course!). It is a flexible and sturdy enough appliance to lift fish filets and other delicate foods from the skillet. Seeing as plastic tends to melt when too hot, we picked plum tree wood for its handle.Both items will be more expensive in retail later on.

You can add the name of the recipient and add a personal note. Shipping CostsOur Story: Putting the Skill in SkilletFrom Side Project to Popular WebzineWhen starting university, it was time to leave the comfort of our parents’ home behind and find a place for ourselves. This also meant setting up our own kitchens and choosing the right cookware and utensils.We began our personal search for cooking appliances offering reasonable value for money, but were quickly frustrated by the lack of information online and thus set out to make a change. Our German online magazine Pfannenhelden.de (transl. ‘skillet heroes’) was born. Our website meanwhile caters to more than 100,000 visitors per month, looking to find detailed and reliable information on skillets and how to best cook with them.We’ve also been invited on various TV shows to share our insights on choosing, using, and caring for your skillets.Filip & Simon with German cooking show hostsIn 2019, Simon left for Paris to attend the prestigious culinary school Ferrandi, described as the “Harvard of gastronomy” by French daily Le Monde. Upon graduating, he spent some time working at Michelin-star restaurant Septime, which currently ranks at #15 of the best restaurants in the world. Next Steps: the STUR SkilletThe first draft for the STUR skillet
While Simon was cooking away in Paris, Filip was working on the first skillet designs in Berlin. From the start, his aim was to create a high-quality skillet, sustainable, durable, and made in Germany. Cast iron quickly became the material of choice, due to its durability, ease of use, and amazing non-stick capabilities.Together with the STUR community (more than 12,000 fans) and renowned German product designers Peter Lasch and Bastian Prillwitz the STUR Skillet began to take shape.Around the same time, Filip started looking for companies able to produce the skillet in Germany and according to STUR standards. Eventually, the first prototype was cast and the STUR Skillet V1 became a reality. Holding this first prototype in our hands was an incredible feeling and frying with it worked just as well.However, we were still receiving feedback about the handle feeling a bit too short, while others suggested adding a hole to hang the skillet on a hook.So it was back to the drawing board to improve certain elements (if you’re curious about the process, you can look up our STUR Skillet design thread on Reddit), the result being our STUR Skillet V2, our final design, which we would now like to produce with your help! Feedback from our Reddit thread Manufacturing the STUR SkilletOur STUR Skillet is 100 % Made In Germany. Casting, smoothing, and seasoning are all performed by trusted partners, whom we know personally. We produce the skillet in three steps: 1. The Foundation: Casting the STUR SkilletEach and every STUR Skillet is cast by the Gienanth foundry, located in the beautiful Pfalz wine region. By using recycled iron, we aim to create an environmentally friendly product and thereby contribute to the responsible use of resources. 2. The Refinement Process: Making the STUR Skillet Smoother and LighterOur skillet’s impressive non-stick properties and comparatively light weight result from the excellent refinement work done by the family-run company SiMetall in Hunsrück, Germany.In short, they mill the interior and bottom of the skillet to bring about a surface texture that is rough enough to retain the seasoning yet smooth enough to prevent food from sticking. 3. The Seasoning: Adding the STUR Skillet’s Natural Non-Stick Layer Though seasoning is a step you can easily do at home, many seem to struggle with the process. To make things more convenient, we decided to season our skillets during production. Our Team

Jahrhundert: leichter, glatter, aber genauso robust wie traditionelle Eisenpfannen. Das macht sie zum idealen Begleiter für Deine täglichen Küchenabenteuer.Wir haben die Pfanne allerdings nicht alleine entwickelt: neben führenden Industriedesignern sowie unserer erfahrenen Partner-Gießerei, standen uns über 12.000 treue STUR-Fans mit ehrlichem Feedback und wertvollen Ratschlägen zur Seite. Tausend Dank für Eure Unterstützung – ohne Euch wäre die STUR-Pfanne nicht das, was sie jetzt ist.9 Gründe, sich für unsere STUR-Pfanne zu entscheiden: 
1. Eine Pfanne für die Ewigkeit
Extrem langlebig und äußerst hitzebeständig: Jede STUR-Pfanne wird in Deutschland hergestellt und aus einem Stück gegossen. Anschließend werden Boden und Innenseite der Pfanne mit höchster Präzision geglättet. Kein wackliger Griff, stabiler Halt und kein Verformen unter Hitzeeinwirkung – eine Pfanne, die für so gut wie jede Kochaktion zu haben ist. 2. Kein Ankleben von SpeisenBereits im Werk abgedreht und eingebrannt: Bitte was? Dank modernster Computertechnik können wir das raue Gusseisen unserer Pfannen so bearbeiten – abdrehen, um genau zu sein – dass eine feine Oberflächenstruktur entsteht. Danach werden mehrere Schichten aus natürlichem Traubenkernöl aufgetragen und auf die Pfanne gebacken. Deine STUR-Pfanne ist also sofort einsatzbereit.Die Kombination dieser Prozesse verleiht unseren Pfannen ihre hervorragenden Antihafteigenschaften, die bei richtiger Handhabung an handelsübliche, PTFE-beschichtete Pfannen herankommen. Und das ohne den Einsatz künstlicher Beschichtungen oder Chemikalien.Das Einbrennen schützt die Pfanne außerdem vor Rost. Solltest Du einmal das Gefühl haben, dass die Antihafteigenschaft Deiner Pfanne nachgelassen hat, kannst Du die Ölschicht übrigens jederzeit selbst erneuern. Wie? Das zeigen wir Dir in unserem STUR-Videokurs, der für alle Kampagnen-Unterstützer kostenlos ist. 3. Das perfekte Werkzeug für die perfekte Kruste Gusseisen speichert und gibt extrem viel Wärme ab. Deshalb ist die STUR-Gusseisenpfanne perfekt dazu geeignet, Deinen Gerichten den richtigen Grad an Bräunung und Knusprigkeit zu geben – ganz gleich ob Fisch, Fleisch oder Gemüse.Mit anderen Worten, sorgt die gespeicherte Wärmeenergie im Gusseisen dafür, dass das Wasser im Bratgut schneller verdampft und erzeugt zugleich intensive Umami-Röstaromen. Einfach köstlich! 4. Made in Germany – unser QualitätsversprechenUnsere Pfanne wird zu 100 % in Deutschland hergestellt und zwar in Zusammenarbeit mit ausgewählten Herstellern, die traditionelle Verfahren mit moderner Technik verbinden. Unsere Partner-Gießerei Gienanth etwa ist weltweit bekannt für die Herstellung von Motorteilen deutscher Premium-Automarken (der Legende nach wurden die Motoren für die ersten Rennwagen von Bugatti bei Gienanth in der Pfalz gegossen). Bis in die 70er-Jahre produzierten sie auch schon eigene Gusseisenpfannen.Dieses Wissen und diese Leidenschaft für Präzision fließen mit jedem Guss in unsere STUR-Pfannen. Das macht uns besonders stolz und ist ein weiterer Beweis dafür, dass herausragende und hochwertige Produkte noch immer hierzulande, lokal gefertigt werden können. 
5. Das richtige Gewicht Eine langlebige Profipfanne muss ein gewisses Gewicht haben. Denn zu dünne Pfannen neigen dazu, sich unter Hitzeeinwirkung zu wölben und heizen infolgedessen nicht mehr gleichmäßig auf.Bei unserer STUR-Pfanne haben wir Material entfernt, wo möglich, und verstärkt, wo nötig. Mit 2,4 kg ist unsere 28-cm-Pfanne weitaus leichter als traditionelle Gusseisenpfannen, aber genauso robust und hat somit genau das richtige Gewicht für den täglichen Gebrauch. 
6. Ergonomischer Griff und Gegengriff Wir haben unzählige Griffe ausprobiert und unsere Community bei der Auswahl um Feedback gebeten. Herausgekommen ist ein minimalistisch gestalteter Griff, der sich ebenso für kleine wie für große Hände eignet und angenehm greift.Durch das Loch im Griff lässt sich die Pfanne bei Bedarf einfach aufhängen. Zusätzlich garantiert der Gegengriff ein sicheres Tragen der vollen Pfanne – selbst mit Topflappen oder Ofenhandschuhen.Und solltest Du Dich jetzt noch fragen, ob der Griff nicht vielleicht zu lang ist, bestätigen wir Dir gerne, dass beide Pfannengrößen problemlos in jeden Standardbackofen passen. 7. Für jede Herdart geeignet Ob Ceran, Elektro, Gas oder Induktion – unsere STUR-Pfanne ist auf jedem Herd zuhause. Der absichtlich dicker gehaltene Boden verteilt die Wärme gleichmäßig und ermöglicht punktgenaues Braten, unabhängig des Kochfeldes. Und für die Griller unter Euch gilt: die STUR-Pfanne kann natürlich auch auf den Grillrost! 
 8. Nicht nur für FleischliebhaberNatürlich lieben Steaks & Schnitzel die STUR-Gusseisenpfanne, doch auch Gemüse fühlt sich in ihr pudelwohl. Aufgrund der hohen Wärmespeicherkapazität und optimalen Hitzeverteilung von Gusseisen bräunt unsere Pfanne Gemüse perfekt an, anstatt es bloß im eigenen Saft zu köcheln.Doch Vorsicht: Wenn Du einmal Pilze oder Spargel mit nuancierten Röstaromen probiert hast, wird es kein Zurück mehr für Dich geben. 9. Unser Videokurs – für alle Indiegogo-Unterstützer kostenlosZwar bedürfen Eisenpfannen etwas Pflege und weisen ein paar weitere Besonderheiten auf, aber wir erklären Dir gerne im Detail, was genau zu beachten ist. Wenn Du unsere Kampagne unterstützt, erhältst Du Zugang zu unserem kompakten Videokurs über Eisenpfannen. Darin erklären wir Dir, wie Du: Doch damit nicht genug: Simon gibt Dir außerdem noch einige Kochtipps aus seiner Zeit in einem Pariser Sternerestaurant mit auf den Weg (das aktuell auf Platz 15 der weltbesten Restaurants geführt wird). Die STUR-Pfanne im VergleichWir haben jedes noch so kleine Detail unserer Pfanne genau durchdacht und akribisch gestaltet. Dabei haben wir unsere gesammelten Erfahrungen aus unzähligen Tests anderer Pfannen und der Arbeit in Profiküchen in die Entwicklung einfließen lassen.Es war uns ein besonderes Anliegen, bei jeder wichtigen Entscheidung unsere Community zu befragen und das Feedback mit in die Entwicklung zu nehmen. Deshalb ist es nicht nur unsere Pfanne, sondern vor allem auch die Pfanne der STUR-Community, und dafür sagen wir Danke!Bitte unterstütz uns jetzt dabei, dieses Meisterwerk in Deine und andere Küchen zu bringen! 
Die Belohnungen für Deine Unterstützung:  Grundsätzlich empfehlen wir, die 28-cm-Pfanne zu bestellen. Sie hat ausreichend Bratfläche, um eine größere Mahlzeit zuzubereiten, kann aber natürlich auch für kleinere Portionen verwendet werden. Die 24-cm-Pfanne eignet sich vor allem um kleinere Portionen oder auch Beilagen zu einem Hauptgericht zuzubereiten. Perfekt ausgestattet bist Du mit dem Set, bestehend aus einer 24-cm- und einer 28-cm-Pfanne. So kannst Du in der großen Pfanne das Hauptgericht zubereiten und parallel in der kleineren Pfanne die Beilage knusprig anbraten. Wie wäre es zum Beispiel mit zwei saftigen Ribeye-Steaks und frisch angedünsteten Steinpilzen?Na, schon Appetit bekommen? Dann unterstütz uns jetzt und freu Dich schon bald über Deine neuen Pfannen! Add-OnsWir haben uns außerdem überlegt, welche Accessoires gut zur STUR-Pfanne passen würden. In Zusammenarbeit mit dem Designstudio Lasch & Prillwitz haben wir einen Griffschutz aus hochwertigem Leder entworfen, den wir ebenso wie unsere Pfannen in Deutschland fertigen lassen. Dieser ist unheimlich praktisch, wenn es darum geht, die heiße Pfanne aus dem Ofen zu holen oder vom Herd zu nehmen. Leicht anzubringen und abzunehmen sorgt er stets für einen sicheren Griff und sieht dazu auch noch richtig gut aus! Unser Pfannenwender wird ebenfalls in Deutschland gefertigt und überzeugt mit einem formschönen Holzgriff. Da Holz weniger hitzeanfällig als Plastik ist, verwenden wir beim Griff geöltes Pflaumenholz. Der Wender selbst ist flexibel und breit genug, um damit auch filigrane Fischfilets aus der Pfanne zu heben.Übrigens: Auch der Griffschutz und der Pfannenwender werden im regulären Handel später mehr kosten. Wer gleich zugreift, spart also. Noch kein Weihnachtsgeschenk?Du würdest die STUR-Pfanne gerne einem lieben Menschen schenken? Wir haben einen ausdruckbaren Gutschein für die Pfanne entworfen. Den Link zum Download schicken wir dann rechtzeitig an alle Unterstützer. 
 Versandkosten  Unsere Story: die jungen PfannenheldenVom Studentenprojekt zum bekannten Online-Magazin Zu Beginn unseres Studiums zogen wir von Zuhause aus und standen plötzlich vor der Herausforderung, uns eigene Kochutensilien zuzulegen. Auf der Suche nach Pfannen, Töpfen und Messern mit gutem Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis stellten wir fest, dass es im Internet und selbst im Fachhandel meist keine ausreichenden oder sogar falsche Informationen gibt.Das wollten wir ändern. Im Studium hatten wir gelernt, Websites zu bauen und fassten eines Tages den Entschluss, unser eigenes Magazin ins Leben zu rufen. So entstand Pfannenhelden.de. Mittlerweile besuchen monatlich über 100.000 Menschen unsere Seite und informieren sich dort über Kauf und Benutzung von Pfannen.Unsere diesbezüglich über die Jahre aufgebaute Pfannenexpertise durften wir auch schon in Fernsehsendungen wie Galileo (ProSieben) oder Der Vorkoster (WDR) mit den Zuschauern teilen. Fernsehauftritte mit Björn Freitag (Der Vorkoster, WDR) und Jumbo Schreiner (Galileo, ProSieben)2019 ging Simon nach Paris, um dort das Küchenhandwerk an der Gastronomie-Fachschule Ferrandi (von der französischen Tageszeitung Le Monde als „Harvard der Gastronomie“ betitelt) zu erlernen. Im Anschluss arbeitete er im Sternerestaurant Septime, das aktuell Platz 15 der weltbesten Restaurants belegt. Der nächste logische Schritt: die STUR-Pfanne Der allererste Entwurf der STUR-Pfanne Während Simon in Paris von Sterneköchen lernte, packte Filip der Unternehmergeist. Und so fing er kurzerhand an, eine eigene Pfanne zu entwickeln. Der Anspruch dabei: Made in Germany, nachhaltig und langlebig. Mit der STUR-Pfanne will er die Gusseisenpfanne nun alltagstauglich machen.Gemeinsam mit der STUR-Community (die mittlerweile aus über 12.000 Leuten besteht) sowie den renommierten Industriedesignern Peter Lasch & Bastian Prillwitz entwickelte er die STUR-Pfanne.Zeitgleich suchte er überall in Deutschland nach Partnerunternehmen, um die Pfanne in der geforderten Qualität produzieren zu können. So entstand der erste Prototyp der Pfanne (die STUR-Pfanne V1). Den ersten Prototyp aus Gusseisen in der Hand zu halten, war ein unbeschreibliches Gefühl! Und er funktionierte bereits hervorragend: Die Brateigenschaften waren genau so, wie wir uns das vorgestellt hatten.Allerdings erhielten wir immer wieder Feedback, dass der Stielgriff noch etwas kurz sei. Auch das Loch zum Aufhängen im Gegengriff stieß nicht nur auf Begeisterung.Also ging es nochmal zurück an den Schreibtisch, um die bemängelten Elemente an der Pfanne zu optimieren. So entstand schließlich die STUR-Pfanne V2 – die Pfanne, die wir mit Deiner Hilfe jetzt in Serie produzieren wollen! Feedback unserer Community 
Der Herstellungsprozess Die STUR-Pfanne wird zu 100 % in Deutschland sowie in Zusammenarbeit mit sorgfältig und von uns persönlich ausgewählten Partnern produziert – vom Guss über die Nachbearbeitung bis hin zur Verpackung. Der Herstellungsprozess umfasst im Kern drei Schritte: 1. Der Guss: die Basis der STUR-PfanneJede STUR-Pfanne wird bei der Gießerei Gienanth in der Pfalz gegossen. Durch die Verwendung von Recyclingeisen und die lange Benutzbarkeit der Pfanne möchten wir unseren Teil zur Ressourcenschonung beitragen. 2. Die Nachbearbeitung: die STUR-Pfanne wird glatter und leichterDie großartigen Antihafteigenschaften und das im Vergleich zu anderen Gusseisenpfannen leichtere Gewicht entstehen im Zuge der Nachbearbeitung durch das Familienunternehmen SiMetall im Hunsrück.Dort drehen wir die Pfanne innen und außen ab, wodurch sie glatter, feiner und plan wird. Die Oberflächenstruktur der Innenseite versehen wir mit einer feinen Ringstruktur, sodass die Ölschicht fest haftet, das Bratgut aber nicht. 3. Das Einbrennen: die natürliche AntihaftschichtPrinzipiell ist das erste Einbrennen einer neuen Pfanne ein Schritt, den Du auch zuhause machen kannst. Wir haben allerdings festgestellt, dass viele Pfannenkäufer diesen Aufwand scheuen. Deshalb übernehmen wir das für Dich. Unser Team
Technische DetailsBitte beachte: Die technischen Details sind noch nicht 100 % final, werden aber bei den ausgelieferten Pfannen nicht groß abweichen.Gewicht: die 28-cm-Pfanne wird etwa 2,4 kg wiegen, die 24-cm-Pfanne etwa 1,8 kg.Deckel: wir haben die Pfannen so gebaut, dass alle Standarddeckel passen (24 cm/28cm). Vorläufiger Zeitplan",76.0,0,"1 Campaign

When possessions or our dear pets go missing, the usual solutions just aren't good enough. That's why we created The AirBolt® GPS, a tracker perfect for every situation.  We're human; we misplace things; we have no idea how the keys got left in the fridge or where the cat has been all night. So, after a stressful night of searching for the cat and catching the bus the next morning because we couldn't find our keys, we knew something had to change.     What we came up with is The AirBolt® GPS. This tracker is perfect. It's small, only 42mm x 42mm (+5.85 mm for upper keyring loop) x 16mm (1.65"" x 1.65"" x 0.63"") and VERY lightweight (approx. 21 grams, 0.75oz). This means it can be hung from a collar or slipped discreetly in a pocket or bag. Since we knew Bluetooth wouldn't cut it, we decided we needed to use GPS.  We took our tracking to the next level, however, by implementing location over LTE-M / NB-IoT, which are next-generation low-powered cellular networks. This way we would have the perfect balance of indoor, outdoor and nearby tracking. We then decided on an ever-growing network so we could track belongings globally.            Gen 3 On wards     We are so proud of what The AirBolt® GPS can do. There are so many uses for every lifestyle that owning one just won't do!   The AirBolt® uses LTE-M/NB-IoT & GPS with the capability to provide quick and accurate location updates on demand.  Our tracking range is global and the list of covered countries is growing rapidly! Nearby tracking is also possible without subscription access, so you are never locked into subscriptions if you don’t want one!      Losing a pet is terrifying, so we designed the AirBolt® GPS to make lost pets a thing of the past. Track them anywhere, keep them safe and put your mind at ease. Set up Geo-Fencing and Separation Alerts, so you will immediately know if they have left the vicinity. The alert button can send you a message if someone else finds your pet.   Use AirBolt® GPS on a child's backpack. Perfect for when they start walking to school themselves, keeping track of sports bags, or locating school items that are missing or forgotten. Check the tracker at school pickup and see if they've left their library bag behind.        Not a morning person? Don't worry about leaving your bag on the train, track your items and set a proximity alarm to alert you if you move away from your belongings.  You can even share access with your family, friends, colleagues or employees. Everyone can keep track of their own belongings.  This is also a great safety feature when travelling alone - share your location with friends and family so they know you’re safe!    Track your equipment, gear or even drones with our small, and VERY lightweight device. The AirBolt®GPS is designed to be versatile and fit all your hobbies.   Nature lover? The AirBolt® GPS is waterproof up to 1m (for 30minutes) with a built-in alert to let you know when it has been submerged.  Give access to your AirBolt® GPS and allow friends and family to know where you are surfing, skiing, hiking or camping.   Worried about your vehicles, tools or work equipment? The discrete size means you can place The AirBolt® GPS in your heavy vehicle, boat, trailer or toolbox without worry. Monitor when your equipment is being used or borrowed and where it's going. Put one in your glovebox to remember where you parked. Place it inside expensive equipment cases. You can even set up a proximity alarm and geo-fence to alert you if something leaves your worksite.         We have made the conscious decision to calculate and charge shipping closer to the time of shipping the units themselves.

<p> Remote2 can work from the box with the following voice assistants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Home (<a href=""https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000c694cb02c1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000c694cb02c1</a>)</li>

<li>Marussia by Mail.ru Group (you can find our brand <a href=""https://capsula.mail.ru/#partners"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>)</li>
<li>Amazon Alexa (in progress)</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of adding integration has been worked out many times. If you need a special voice assistant not included in our list above, we can quickly – within 14 days – add it.</p>
<h2>HomeKit Support</h2>
<p>Remote 2 supports HomeKit for AC units. Making an air conditioner smart is now easy and adding to HomeKit takes a few minutes. It is enough to choose the model and brand of your air conditioner. This will be fully native support at the time of release.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all other device types (such as TV, Fans and others) will not works with HomeKit. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611505970/zmap8cav9j47twoodmmw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Realtime IR analysis</h2>
<p>Remote2 analyzes IR signals in the room in real time. </p>
<p>This means that even if you turned on your air conditioner from your physical branded remote control, the Remote will pick up this signal and recognize it. </p>
<p>If you turned on the air conditioner at 23 degrees, then you will see this temperature in voice assistants, HomeKit and even through the HTTP API.</p>
<p>In this video we will try to illustrate how this function works.</p>
<p> </p>
<div> </div>
<p>That is, if you turned on the TV from the remote control, then in Google Home it will also be shown on. If you change AC temperature from physical IR Remote you can see current set temperature too.</p>
<h2>Built-in temperature and humidity sensors</h2>
<p>The Remote has built-in temperature and humidity sensors. They are available in both the app &amp; HTTP REST API. So you will always know the climate in the room. Naturally, since the device provides HomeKit support, you can always ask Siri or another voice assistant for the temperature.</p>
<h2>Integration with Smart Home Hubs</h2>
<p>Remote can be integrated into almost any smart home system via HTTP requests and virtual devices (<a href=""https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11774062/SzzkddLg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">documentation on Postman</a>).</p>
<p>We are actively expanding the integration of Remote into smart home systems, for example, the <a href=""https://github.com/smartHomeHub/SmartIR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SmartIR</a> plugin for HomeAssistant already has Remote support. Current roadmap:</p>
<p><strong>Available by July 2021 </strong>(first wave):</p>
<ul>
<li>Home Assistant plugin</li>
<li>HomeBridge plugin</li>
<li>Athom Homey app</li>
<li>Local MQTT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Available no later than end of 2021</strong> (second wave):</p>
<ul>
<li>SmartThings support</li>
<li>HomeSeer support</li>
<li>NodeRed support</li>
<li>JeeDom support</li>
</ul>
<p>We will do everything in our power to ensure that the second wave plugins come out earlier. Also, if you are interested in some kind of automation system that is not listed above - let us know in the comments and we will put it in the roadmap. Our goal is maximum device support in all home automation systems.</p>
<p>At the request of the community, we quickly carried out the necessary tests and can confirm that <strong>local MQTT </strong>will also appear on Remote2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>In-device Automation</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611506340/csngf0nvwp3lhqkm5w10.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Most smart home systems are built around a central controller. It runs automation and access control. It provides a beautiful interface for managing your home. It stores all the rules of behaviour for devices and scenes.</p>
<p>LOOK.in device allows you to abandon it.</p>
<p>The LOOK.in project is based on the principles of group robotics.</p>
<p>This means that you can create automation scenarios using a branded application and they will be implemented without the Internet and a third-party controller.</p>
<p>Examples of automations that can be implemented using Remote built-in automation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on the TV to the First Channel at 8 pm on weekdays and turn off the TV at 9 pm</li>
<li>Turn on the air conditioner at 3 am and turn it off at 4 am</li>
<li>If a signal is received to turn on the TV, the receiver and TV-box are also turned on</li>
<li>Switch the humidifier mode to medium at 11 pm on weekends; switch it to eco in the morning</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is only about built-in automation. When Remote is integrated into any smart home system, its possibilities are almost endless.</p>
<h2>External Temperature Sensor and External IR Transmitter</h2>
<p>We have provided Remote2 with the ability to connect an external temperature sensor and an external IR transmitter.</p>
<p>An external temperature sensor can be useful, for example, if you intend to control an air conditioner or ventilator using the Remote. In this case, such automation rules as turning on the ventilator or air conditioner become available if the temperature exceeds a preset threshold.</p>
<p>An external IR transmitter can be useful if the Remote is hidden in a nightstand or needs to control a device that is out of reach of IR rays.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611506399/esoawdslr0gbrfyubn3i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However, in order not to overload the design of the device and not to change its case, we had to implement this function using an external adapter. It is a micro-USB extension cable with two branches in the form of 3.5 mm jacks. The adapter is inserted into the Remote and then it is possible to connect standard 1-wire temperature sensors to the jacks, for example, DS18B20, and any IR extender with a 3.5 mm jack.</p>
<p>There are 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapter + external temperature sensor OR external IR transmitter for $7</li>
<li>Adapter + external temperature sensor AND external IR transmitter for $9</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need an adapter please add bonus support to your pledge. If you have selected more than one device, then specify bonus support in multiples of the number of devices for which the add-on is required. </p>
<p>If you chose the $7 add-on we will ask you what to put in the box before shipping: external temperature sensor or an external IR transmitter.</p>
<h2>From the creators to potential bakers</h2>
<p>If you have read this far, then the project seemed interesting to you. Thank you for paying attention to it.</p>
<p>We work day after day so that LOOKin Remote2 is going to be released and we hope that it will take its place in the homes and apartments of those who supported it. </p>
<p>If you are interested in the device, then we ask you to support it now, and not wait until it appears in stores. Because otherwise, this device may never be released.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone who decided to support the campaign or spread the word about us.</p>
</div></div>","LOOK.in Remote2 is a universal IR remote that can be integrated into almost any Smart Home system or even work independently – without a controller.
Moreover, it does not require the Internet or cloud services to work.*
Control your TV, fans, humidifiers, Media centers and air conditioners the way you like.
Remote2 supports integration with voice assistants such as Google Home, Yandex Smart Home, Amazon Alexa (in progress). It also can be integrated into almost any existing smart home system.

<h2><strong>Having a bidet is great.</strong></h2>
<p>Apart from the fact that it is undeniably the best solution to total bum-hygiene, it also saves us a ton on toilet paper consumption... and the number of trees killed for our lifetime supply of it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591619697/bj7osfrmdia2tvcrjshf.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>But there's simply no portable bidets that are good enough.</h2>
<p>Automatic bidets are troublesome to charge, and manual bidets simply aren’t portable enough, with their long nozzles and large bottles. The smaller ones are not ergonomic enough for easy squeezing and aiming. Many of them leak if there’s water in them... we just simply couldn't find the right one.</p>

<h2>Plus, filling a bidet at the public sink gets you weird stares.</h2>
<p>There is still an unspoken taboo about using the bidet in many parts of the world, and because of this, using bidets outside of the home might be subject to curious stares which can be uncomfortable to the user. </p>

Apart from the fact that it is undeniably the best solution to total bum-hygiene, it also saves us a ton on toilet paper consumption... and the number of trees killed for our lifetime supply of it.


 
But there's simply no portable bidets that are good enough.
Automatic bidets are troublesome to charge, and manual bidets simply aren’t portable enough, with their long nozzles and large bottles. The smaller ones are not ergonomic enough for easy squeezing and aiming. Many of them leak if there’s water in them... we just simply couldn't find the right one.

Plus, filling a bidet at the public sink gets you weird stares.
There is still an unspoken taboo about using the bidet in many parts of the world, and because of this, using bidets outside of the home might be subject to curious stares which can be uncomfortable to the user. 

So, we developed the solution.

A universal plug, bidet-style.
Our Bidoo™ Nozzle fits to most common PET bottles so you can use most available water bottles in your bag without compromising on space.
 
So for those times you’re really short on space, just pop the Nozzle in your pocket, and you’ll have a bidet with you for those emergency moments! 
 
 
Ergonomically designed for the best squeeze.
We spent months researching and testing the best materials, bottle shapes and nozzle lengths... even down to the angle of spray- so that comfort comes out tops during the entire washing experience.
 
 Seal in your own water source anytime, anywhere.Say goodbye to filling bidets at the sink in public restrooms while people stare. Every Bidoo™ has its own cap to seal in the water so you can have a water source with you at all times and places.  Murat Ursavas is the co-founder of Bidoo™.

<p>Did you know dogs will often eat cat feces? Yup! It's a gross, yet known canine behavior. It can also be really dangerous! Eating feces carries the potential for the dog to contract harmful pathogens. Some bacteria, like salmonella, can even be transmitted to humans.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628193719/sssjxd69bmqjzkckpwjw.png"" src=""""/>Animal Poison Control Centers in the U.S. received over 140,000 calls related to pet exposures to toxic substances in 2009 and more than 167,000 such calls in 2010.

Stay out of my litter box! 

 




 

 

 

 
DON'T SLAM THE....  

Door injuries are definitely a big concern for parents.Ouch! Each year in the US, nearly 300,000 children are rushed to hospital due to door injury incidents. Door injuries result in about 15,000 finger amputations every year. (Data - National Security Council).

DOORWING locks the door automatically upon door closure in a slightly open position (the opening is about 1.5 inches) to ensure hand safety, free airflow, and proper ventilation. 

 
Lock it up!

Parents often store cleaning products, medications, adhesives, soaps and other harmful chemicals in pantries and closets.

Bathrooms typically contain many dangers, like toilet and tub hazards, hot water, sharp objects (razors and scissors), and toxic substances (soaps, air fresheners, cosmetics, medications).

Babies, toddlers and pets are super cute and also super curious! Those little hands (and paws) just want to touch everything they see, and exploring new territories is always a favorite activity.

Parents are often busy and overwhelmed with daily routine, and it can be difficult to keep children safe without taking proper measures. DOORWING is a simple and effective solution.

DOORWING locks any interior door and Keeps your kids and pets away from off-limit areas.
 
 
Our furry family members

Did you know dogs will often eat cat feces? Yup! It's a gross, yet known canine behavior. It can also be really dangerous! Eating feces carries the potential for the dog to contract harmful pathogens. Some bacteria, like salmonella, can even be transmitted to humans.Animal Poison Control Centers in the U.S. received over 140,000 calls related to pet exposures to toxic substances in 2009 and more than 167,000 such calls in 2010. Many of these calls were due to common household products that are likely present in your pet's environment right now.

DOORWING to the rescue! Help your pets stay out of trouble.  

Keep your dogs and kids out of the cat's litter box and food bowl. The size of the opening is adjustable to allow access to cats, while keeping dogs and kids out. The biggest opening size is about 5 inches, which will allow most cats to comfortably fit through.

After all, cats deserve some privacy and DOORWING is what every cat is waiting for!

 
 
DOORWING is all about damage free doors 

Super easy to install. It takes just seconds.

No assembly or tools required. Leave your doors perfectly damage free! International Adaptability 

DOORWING adjusts to almost any door and door frame size and thickness.

 

DOORWING attaches firmly to the door via pressure mounting mechanism, assuring kids and pets will not be able to remove it. The door mount includes soft rubber pads that effectively protect your door's finish from any damage.  
 
 What else?

DOORWING is portable. Take it with you on vacations or to grandma's house.

To use DOORWING as a finger guard without locking the door, fold the hook to disable locking mechanism.

Don't worry about bumping into it all the time. Simply fold it against the door and keep it out of your way.

No need to take the device off the door each time you don't need to use it. Just keep it there! You can fully close the door while it's folded away.

DOORWING conveniently unlocks from either side of the door and eliminates the risk of accidental lock-ins, which often happen with other door proofing locks that can only be unlocked from one side.

Older Siblings deserve their freedom and privacy! Install low enough to give them access but high enough to eliminate access to younger siblings and/or pets.

Double doors? No problem.

<p>Are you ready to start cooking in a smarter, more efficient way? From the creators of the “Masters Cookware Collection”, another foodie favorite accessory bundle ready to remodel the way you cook. We are proud to introduce Ausker’s brand new collection of Kitchen Utensils. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625669020/ahwhrpe9twffitzru4mh.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625583811/enpp1wehopijyzq8btno.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After shaping new ways to ease everyone’s life in the kitchen with knives and cookware, we thought it was time to expand the range of our creations and complete the circle. Ausker’s versatile Kitchen Tool Set aims to simplify your cooking experience with style while preserving your cookware from damage.</p>
<p>Too often we see damaged cookware or non-stick coating. Most of the time this happens due to misuse of utensils, especially steel ones. Our purpose is to help you cook better and faster while looking after your precious cookware.</p>
<p>This is the fourth crowdfunding project we launch, and our happy backers’ list is constantly growing, project after project.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ausker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Quotes-slider.gif"" src=""""/></p>
</div><p>Since we founded Ausker in 2015, we reached over 15’000 customers in over 70 countries. And it is thanks to them if we can present you with this brand new product.

It is thanks to this constant partnership with our backers that we can deliver quality products, exactly how you need them.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626112431/eq3ikofsmfrgx2una4dn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The most compatible and versatile material for a Kitchen Tool Set is definitely nylon and we thought this was the perfect choice for our Tool Set bodies. We have chosen this material for its workability, flexibility, and resistance to heat and stress. Nylon can be used on any cooking surface: non-stick aluminum, steel, copper, and even cast iron. Our choice of high-quality nylon can stand very high temperatures, up to 390° F (200° C).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626119736/dcddbps6eavqb0hesru3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>And yes, nylon is gentle with cookware. But we felt like it was not enough in two separate ways: efficiency, in some cases, and multifunctionality application. Therefore, we decided to develop a silicone edge where it matters the most and add a complete anti-scratch feature. You know, we make non-stick cookware, and preserving it is essential for healthy and safe cooking. On top of it, our silicone has vigorous heat resistance, up to 445° F (230° C) for normal cooking purposes.</p><p>Our soft silicone edge not only accomplishes great workability, but it allows us to bend it to our needs, creating versatility in each different Tool. All this, while being the gentlest Kitchen Tool Set you will ever see.</p><p>Versatility is nothing without efficiency. Here’s why our Tool Set is made in materials that are easy to clean and non-porous, securing health and hygiene.

From the creators of the “Masters Cookware Collection”, another foodie favorite accessory bundle ready to remodel the way you cook. We are proud to introduce Ausker’s brand new collection of Kitchen Utensils. 
After shaping new ways to ease everyone’s life in the kitchen with knives and cookware, we thought it was time to expand the range of our creations and complete the circle. Ausker’s versatile Kitchen Tool Set aims to simplify your cooking experience with style while preserving your cookware from damage.
Too often we see damaged cookware or non-stick coating. Most of the time this happens due to misuse of utensils, especially steel ones. Our purpose is to help you cook better and faster while looking after your precious cookware.
This is the fourth crowdfunding project we launch, and our happy backers’ list is constantly growing, project after project.

Since we founded Ausker in 2015, we reached over 15’000 customers in over 70 countries. And it is thanks to them if we can present you with this brand new product. Actually, it was our community who deliberately expressed their desire for a Tool Set via a survey we sent out after completion of the Masters Collection project. It is thanks to this constant partnership with our backers that we can deliver quality products, exactly how you need them.The most compatible and versatile material for a Kitchen Tool Set is definitely nylon and we thought this was the perfect choice for our Tool Set bodies. We have chosen this material for its workability, flexibility, and resistance to heat and stress. Nylon can be used on any cooking surface: non-stick aluminum, steel, copper, and even cast iron. Our choice of high-quality nylon can stand very high temperatures, up to 390° F (200° C).And yes, nylon is gentle with cookware. But we felt like it was not enough in two separate ways: efficiency, in some cases, and multifunctionality application. Therefore, we decided to develop a silicone edge where it matters the most and add a complete anti-scratch feature. You know, we make non-stick cookware, and preserving it is essential for healthy and safe cooking. On top of it, our silicone has vigorous heat resistance, up to 445° F (230° C) for normal cooking purposes.Our soft silicone edge not only accomplishes great workability, but it allows us to bend it to our needs, creating versatility in each different Tool. All this, while being the gentlest Kitchen Tool Set you will ever see.Versatility is nothing without efficiency. Here’s why our Tool Set is made in materials that are easy to clean and non-porous, securing health and hygiene. And to make you feel even safer, we offer a 2-year long warranty if something goes wrong. All our materials are compliant with US FDA and EU Regulations, to ensure maximum safety for food contact.Get creative and inspired by ultra-versatility: we are confident you will be excited to try each feature our Tool Set has to offer. And when you’ll be amazed by how your cooking has changed and improved, you won’t be able to do without them anymore.One of the most used tools in the World. It has multiple applications in the States like in Asia. A classic, essential all-rounder. We are giving it a new youth. The Slotted Turner includes a soft silicon edge for easy turning. You’ll be amazed how easy it will run under your pancakes while being extra gentle on the frypan surface. We also include a serrated edge for cutting soft or half-cooked ingredients. It also features a small grater on its lower neck for garlic, ginger, shallots, or anything else you need to mince.A soup’s best friend. Another classic concept we try to upgrade. It features easy pouring and serving spouts, so you’ll never spill a drop on your counter. The curving design, integrated with a silicon front edge promotes easy anti-scratch scooping.In those cases when you need to be precise in your recipes, easy-to-see measuring lines for 60 (1/4 cup), 90 (1/3 cup), and 120ml (1/2 cup) will help you be always accurate.And on its neck, we add four little holes of different sizes for perfect herb filtering.Average skimmers are often way too small. Our Skimmer is big, generous, and can welcome larger amounts of food, simplifying and accelerating your cooking processes.Since the skimmer can be used on multiple occasions, for both wet and dry recipes, we gave him a slightly serrated edge to cut, and the most convenient four holes of varied size for easy herb filtering.The Pasta Server will revolutionize the way you cook your favorite Italian dish.It offers a central hole for the perfect one-portion quantity.Like all Tools, it has a gentle silicone front edge for easy and safe pasta scooping. The edge also comes super handy when it’s time to thicken your sauce efficiently scraping and deglazing the frying pan. And when your dish is ready, the built-in grater on the back of the tool will help you sprinkle parmesan on your creation.The Whisk is going to drastically improve the way you mix your recipes. It is designed to let liquids run and mix evenly, with an opening on the bottom aiming not to trap a single piece.Its silicone-edged spoke is designed to clean every wall in your bowls, leaving nothing behind (and for your kids to clean!).Plus, the ergonomic and perfectly balanced grip can ease the pressure on your wrist, enhancing your whipping ability with lesser fatigue. Another must-have in every kitchen, a utensil that can be used for most recipes.Its silicone edges are gentle on food as well as on cooking surfaces, allowing you to deglaze and scrap like a pro with a light heart.It features an adaptive spring for perfect pressure management, you will be the one to decide how much it needs to open.

Simply use the specially fitted stainless steel spoon for teabags and a superb micro-mesh sieve for loose leaf tea that you already have at home.

Choose a cup size between 50 ml and 500 ml (1.7-16.9 fl.oz.), pick a brewingtemperature from 40°C (104°F) to boiling hot and adjust your brewing time between 30 seconds to 60 minutes. Save your perfect tea flavor settings in BRÜ’s handy smartphoneapp and enjoy it next time or experiment with different brews.Then sit back and sip your perfect cup of tea.
 

With BRÜ’s built-in multiple infusion functionality, create as many distinct aromasas you’d like. Set for each brewing cycle a different temperature, brewing timeand cup size and enjoy the taste of diversity.
 
This means the same quantity of water, the same brew strength and the same great flavour—with any type of tea. Remove the inconsistencies of making tea and just enjoy drinking it. 
 
Have you ever forgotten your teabag in the tea? Or waiting for it to cool, only for it to cool too much? With BRÜ, all you need to do is set it up—the perfect cup of tea will pour out ready to drink!          For those times when you don’t want to wait for your tea to cool down to a drinkable temperature, the machine will brew a strong but small amount of tea, dispense it into your cup and then add the right amount of cold water from the tank to dilute it and bring the temperature down. 
  
With its Infinity Mode, BRÜ pours continuous hot water at any temperature you need until you choose to stop it! Perfect for pot noodles, making jello or those times where you just want an instant coffee. 
 

Every day, in the UK alone, 3,525 extra tons of CO2 are produced every day because kettles boil extra water that isn’t needed.
No more over-filling and repeated boiling of water you're not going to use. Not only does this save time and money, but it also saves the planet. Fact. 
 

Every BRÜ machine is fitted with multiple sensors to keep it as safe and easy to use as possible. 
No hot water will flow into the brewing chamber until the lid is closed, and your tea won't be dispensed until a cup is detected—meaning you'll never walk into your kitchen to find a mess on the floor if you forget to put a mug in place.
 

From the first sketch a few years ago, we've worked closely with very experienced industrial designers and an engineering company which specializes in consumer products. We’ve spent a lot of time evaluating all concepts to finalize the 'design for manufacture' stage, ensuring everything is as ready as possible for production to start.After a long time of development and testing, BRÜ is ready to be manufactured.If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact us via to support@bru-tea.com

That’s enough to feed 2 billion extra people annually.Fridge Eye helps you stay green and reduce food waste. ood waste amounts to a lot more than wasted money.

""...Move will have found a simple answer to a complex problem, and being able to offer this functionality for a much more budget-friendly price than the competition could give Teptron a significant edge at launch”
 Z-Wave motor for existing indoor blinds and shades It is built to fit as many different manually controlled indoor blinds and shades as possible. That is why MOVEZ can be retrofitted to nearly all different manually controlled indoor blinds and shades. No matter if its continuous cord loops, bead chain loop, bead chain with connectors or just reeling in a cord MOVEZ will be able to operate it. ""MOVEZ mounted on a Roller shade"" ”fits almost all indoor blinds and shades with cord, cord loop and bead chain operation”​​""MOVEZ mounted on a Venetian blind""​ MOVEZ works on almost all types of materials, diameters and different numbers of beads per inch that bead chains can have. It also works with almost all types of bead chain connectors.​”bead chain connectors is not an issue” ENJOY MOTORIZED BLINDS AND SHADES Convenience”Wouldn´t it be nice if...”​Your blinds and shades lived there own life, acting automatic?When you turned on your TV, to watch a really good movie, your blinds closed by themselves?Your blinds closed at night and opened in the morning according to your own timetable? ”...there are endless of scenarios, which do you prefer?”  Reduce Sun-fadingBy using different triggers, such as for example sun sensors, you can trigger MOVEZ to act on sun conditions. This will increase the life length of your floors, sofas, wall paintings, walls, flowers, rugs etc”Preserve your interior...”  Save energyYour existing blinds and shades are insulators. They can reduce heating in the summer by 20% and make you lose 5-15% less heat through windows in the winter if used optimal.”Lower your energy costs...”  Controlling MOVEZDifferent possibilities to control MOVEZ depends on which Home Automation system you have at home. MOVEZ can also be controlled by pushing the physical buttons on the unit....add a motor for your indoor blinds and shades to your Home Automation system”  
COMPATIBILITY
Integration will be possible with many Home Automation systems that uses Z-Wave protocol. We hope to integrate with:
Telldus, Almond+, AMX, BitWise, Branto, Castle OS, Comfort, Control4, Cortexa, Cozify, e-Domotica, Elan g, Elitehome, Fibaro, Hive, HomeSeer, Homey, Indigo, Iris, Logitech Harmony, nCube, Neeo, Nexia, OOMI, OpenHAB, Peq, Popp Home, Proove, SmartThings, StackBox, Staples Connect, SwannOne, Vera, Vivint, Webee, Wink, Zipabox.
 
Sound of MOVEZ
”...shhhhh”


 

 
 

Power options
We wanted MOVEZ to be as easy as possible to install out of the box so we made MOVEZ run on NiMH rechargeable batteries (4 x AAA) as default and by using the included solar panel in combination with rechargeable batteries MOVEZ will become self-sufficient.
MOVEZ can also be installed with permanent power by using a USB port power supply with a micro USB cable (not included).


 
 
Preparing MOVEZ
The first thing to do when installing MOVEZ is to prepare it depending on what type of blind or shade you are going to install it on.
We have made accessories (three different spools, all included in the package) in order for MOVEZ to be installed on different types of cord, cord loop or bead chain operating mechanism.
Below is videos showing how to prepare MOVEZ for the different types of adjustment mechanisms on window covering:
 

”Preparing MOVEZ for installation on window coverings that is operated with bead chain”
 

”Preparing MOVEZ for installation on window coverings that is operated with cord loops”​
 


”Preparing MOVEZ for installation on window coverings that is operated with cords”​
 
Mounting MOVEZ
MOVEZ can be retrofitted to nearly all different manually controlled indoor blinds and shades. No matter if its continuous cord loops, bead chain loop, bead chain with connectors or just reeling in a cord MOVEZ will be able to operate it.
MOVEZ can be mounted with either dual side tape or wall brackets
 
MOVEZ will for example fit the following products:

Nevertheless we all share the same passion: cooking. We want our food to be something special every time. But at the same time, we try to eat healthy. That's why it was an indoor grill that brought us together. We already worked as a team manufacturing the original Flagship grill pans and solved all possible production hiccups doing that. At the moment, we are the 9 people, including CAD designer from Washington, DC, USA; industrial engineer from Philadelphia, PA, USA; cast iron plant production manager from Shijiazhuang, China; logistics coordinator from Guangzhou, China; shipping specialist from Riga, EU; PR director from Los Angeles, CA, USA; graphic designer from Kiev, Ukraine; chemical engineer from Moscow, Russia and a business administrator from Baltimore, MD, USA. We have also established working relationships with two logistics companies to ensure smooth and timely delivery of all rewards to our backers. The team is well-prepared and qualified to guarantee the best product delivered to your kitchen.</p></div>","Dry heat is what distinguishes an outdoor grill from a skillet, where the food is either stewed or stir-fried in oil. Flagship is designed to create the full effect of a fire grill in the comfort of your own kitchen.It looks astoundingly simple to use because it is. Flagship Light slides into any skillet and heats up from it's surface. You can oil the skillet or use it without any grease. The bottom of the grill is machined after casting to shed off extra weight. Exclusively for the first Elite batch, we added polishing to create the ideal smooth contact surface. Time-consuming hand polishing is not intended for mass production, but it'll be included in the limited Elite Batch as an appreciation for your early support.     Ideally polished bottom of first production units. August 20, 2021
 
  It started as a joke. Let's fry eggs and cheese on the grill. The awesome results led us to experiment with grilling anything and everything. The conclusion: if it can be fried, it can be grilled. Just as tasty, and much healthier. Flagship doesn't need a skillet when used outdoors on open fire, park-style BBQs, charcoals or camping stoves. It wouldn't take much space in your bag and will help you to control the temperature to grill perfectly crispy food in any unfamiliar conditions. 
Before acquiring the brand and becoming Flagship, our team members helped the original company manufacture and deliver rewards. We partnered with a cast iron facility. Now we own IP and production molds to ensure prompt manufacturing.  All our products come with a guarantee. Flagship Grill Light comes with a limited LIFETIME WARRANTY. We tested it enough to be sure it'll last a lifetime. HOW IT WORKS 
  The dry heat system sets Flagship apart from most grills and frying pans on the market. While the cooking ridges are leveled, the proprietary draining channels are sloped to remove excess fat and moisture. The bottom of Flagship Light is engineered to keep drained liquids outside of cooking area, maintaining swift heat transfer and uniform temperature distribution. As in any outdoor grill, the dry heat technology helps to preserve flavors and keep the food juicier. At the same time the food isn't soaked with oil and fat.
 
  Mmm, cheesy, not greasy! All Flagship products are pre-seasoned with natural vegetable oil and ready to use. And the more you use it, the more non-stick it becomes. Kitchen space is essential but sometimes we need to cook more food than one pan could accommodate. Flagship Light saves space and time. Convert several skillets into grills and cook surf-n-turfs or burgers and veggies at once. Our optional Flagship Easy Grips are made of extremely durable stainless steel with non-slip silicon inserts. You'll be able to order any accessories on the post-campaign survey.
 
 REWARDS Shipping is not charged during the campaign to keep it as low as possible. The straight cost will be passed on to you at the time of delivery. Please see the shipping rates in the above graphics. Less expensive ""slow shipping"" options will also be available. The Flagship Easy Grip

Whether you prefer hot or cold — brewing with Mosi takes no time, no effort, and you won't need to carry around any messy tools.  With Mosi, brewing the perfect cup of tea is easy.1. Add loose-leaf tea to the sieve and secure it to the lid. 2. Add hot water, close the cap, and turn upside down to steep for the required time.  3. Flip it back over, sip and enjoy. Say goodbye to broken and cracked bottles! Mosi is made from Tritan™, which has the look and feel of glass, and tough enough to endure extreme temperatures and fumbling hands.Mosi Tea™ has a patent-pending, multisensory design. The mouthpiece shape mimics a teacup, and includes tiny holes that allow you to experience ""chemosensation"" — meaning you can smell and taste your tea at the same time, enhancing the flavor of every sip.Have you ever tried to wash a mesh tea strainer? It’s not easy! Our sieve is made of flexible, food-safe silicone for quick and easy cleaning. Plus you’ll love the pop of color!Since you have to turn Mosi over to brew your tea, we felt like we needed to make it leak-proof. We’ve got you (and your tea!) covered!With Mosi, you get your hands back. Pop the lid open with one hand, while ferociously texting your friend about your awesome Mosi Tea Infuser. While it only takes one hand to drink, it only takes one finger to carry... Or zero! Go ahead and just clip Mosi to your backpack, stroller, or anything else to get both your hands back! Be confident that your tea will stay hot or cold for hours on end thanks to the double-wall design. At the same time, everyone else can only admire the beau-tea-ful colors!Worried about water beads on the outside of your Mosi Tea Infuser and what they'll do to the inside of your bag? Don’t sweat it.. because Mosi doesn't sweat either. Everyone needs a little extra peace of mind every once in awhile. With silicone on the bottom and top, your Mosi Tea Infuser won’t go slippin’ or slidin’. We’ve carefully and meticulously selected only the safest materials.

However, the existing products used to control Raspberry Pi all lack aesthetics, with some even requiring users to control via a wireless keyboard, air mouse or even PCB boards with IR receivers, creating a user-experience that is far from perfect. As a result, we had come out with the idea to create Remodo X, an elegant remote controller designed specifically for Raspberry Pi that can be programmed by a mobile app via Bluetooth connection - giving users the ability to control their smart living and in-home entertainment just with a click of a button.  Control Your Raspberry Pi Home Automation ProjectsSupporting open source software such as OpenHAB and Home-Assistant, the Remodo X allows users full control over their entire house's lighting, sound system, air conditioner and much more with just 4 buttons to trigger any scene control via HID scripts - all programmed through an user-friendly and intuitive mobile app. Support Home-EntertainmentRemodo X supports users to easily control Kodi as a media centre and run applications like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify and other OTT software, giving users the ability to play, pause, fast-forward, and rewind to watch at their own pace. Support Social MediaBy programming the buttons to mimic HID commands on your smart devices and make browsing social media platforms convenient and effortless, such as Instagram, Snapchat, Tiktok (.....and Shhhhh even Tinder), to scroll up and down, left and right, like and share with the touch of a button.  Easy to Set-upTo set up the Remodo X, simply pair it to the Remodo app on a smartphone or tablet. There are built-in presets in the Remodo app, making it quick and easy for users to configure the remote. A combination of short press and long press allows for 8 different types of scenes. Find Me BuzzerLost your Remodo X? Don’t worry! The remote is fitted with a built-in Find Me function. Simply use the app to activate the buzzer and locate the Remodo X.  Beautiful DesignWith 4 simple buttons, supporting 8 keys with single press or long press. It comes in 2 colors - Gun Metal Grey & Orange. Presentation Remote (Clicker)In addition to a normal clicker, Remodo X can have specific IR key for projectors (e.g. Freeze) to be programmed. This is a sought-after feature for lecturers / trainers when logging into various cloud services (protecting password privacy).  An unique feature that other clickers simply don't have.  Universal IR ControlRemodo X can also dub as a simple replacement Infrared remote controller and it supports over 6,000 branded devices including TV's, projectors, STB, room-based A/Cs, Dyson fans, A/V receivers, sound bars, and many more. GitHub Page for DevelopersA GitHub page for supporting popular Raspberry Pi smart home projects such as open source platforms like Home-Assistant, OpenHAB and Kodi, etc. We have already started some work in this and this will be released - updated in our website as the project moves along.  How We Create Remodo XWe began this journey in 2019 with a mission to create an elegant remote controller designed specifically for Raspberry Pi. This idea was born after we conducted a survey on the market and CES 2020. After that, we made dozens of designs, prototypes and began tooling in order to deliver the best remote controller, with great appearance and also an aesthetic feel to our customers. Our programmers have worked so hard on Bluetooth connectivity firmware and developing apps. After almost a year, we are excited to present to you our elegant Remodo X and dedicated mobile app - making your smart home projects and in-home entertainment more enjoyable.    Remotec Technology Limited was founded in Hong Kong in 1988 and has been specializing in designing, shipping home automation and remote controllers. With clients from all across the globe, our capabilities and innovations have kept customers satisfied for over 30 years. We launched our first universal remote in the 1980's and has yet to stop innovating since. We created this industry and now, we’re ready to do it again! First time launching a crowdfunding project for the Raspberry Pi supporters. With your help and support, we will be able to begin production and bring this product to your home - making your smart home projects and in-home entertainment even more seamless and enjoyable.  Media About UsCheck out the article and video from Electromaker CES 2020 & Bluetooth Asia Conference 2019The Remotec team has been featured and a part of numerous international technology exhibitions including CES 2020 and Bluetooth Asia Conference 2019, just to name a few.

It offers more powerful deep cleaning in microscopic level compared to traditional ultrasonic cleaners.With 45,000 sound waves impacting per second, it can eliminate 99.9% of dirt, particles and bacteria on the items. There are 3 different power modes for you to select, suiting each item you are going to clean. WashUP is one of the first ultrasonic washing tools that can be used wirelessly. You can wash anything without the risk of putting the power cable into water, which can be really dangerous. Feel safe to wash with WashUP every time. WashUP is extremely portable, you can bring it along easily when you are travelling or camping as it will barely occupy the precious space of your bag or suitcase. WashUP is so quiet that you won’t even notice when it is washing your stuff, so feel free to wash anything anytime and anywhere. You can even use it to clean late at night - it won't wake up a baby. You can easily recharge WashUP by placing it back on the compact charging pad, no need to plug-in any charging cable at all. It will fully recharge under two hours. Choosing WashUP doesn’t only save you time and money, but it also saves our precious natural environment. WashUP uses 40 times less water and 15 times less energy per wash compared to a traditional washing machine. You can save the environment and reduce water and electricity usage at the same time when you wash your stuff.Washing machine is a great invention. It takes care of your laundry chore and gives you more free time. But on the other hand, it is only efficient when you have a full load to wash. If you do not fill it up every time, you will be wasting water and electricity unnecessarily. The washer is also a large appliance made of metal and plastic, both contribute significant amount of carbon footprint at production and disposal.Replacing your washing machine with WashUP will save ~70kg of plastic and metal from being manufactured and eventual disposal. To truly eliminate waste for the planet, we have made WashUP more powerful and long-lasting than the alternatives. Our goal is to replace washing machine for smaller households, so that clothing can be cleaned with less harm to our environment. Start using WashUP to clean your items more thoroughly and easily while saving a lot of water and energy! It's everyone's responsibility to save our natural environment!    A basic WashUP set includes a WashUP device, a charging pad, a charging cable and a user manual. We are also presenting the best detergent for your washing experience.

Apollo designed to be the softest towel and made from high-quality blends of the best materials.  After hours of investigation, research & development, using nanotechnology inspired by NASA we've refined our fabric and built a better towel. Which delivers premium quality, high-tech performance & maximum softness.  Many towels are made the same materials and haven't changed in a long time, but the look and feel of a Towel largely depend on what type of material is used. NANITE TECHNOLOGY FIBERSUsing advanced composite materials to create high-performance fibers using our cotton / polymer matrix blend & engineered with nanite technology. We call it XPLORE 11®. We've developed a new way to use nanomaterials in fabrication. Our technique involves selectively placing modified polymer into the yarn resin to create a nanocomposite that has increased properties on strength, absorption and softness on a scale never done before.  The patenting process is ongoing with the support of the kickstarter & Indiegogo community we can ensure the protection of our intellectual property and continue the legal and costly exercise to further the patenting process. The result is a technological leap in fabric & towel design. Apollo now makes nanomaterials more accessible, versatile and ready for use in your home.   Towels designed and priced for everyday use are made of sub-standard materials. With our trademarked composite material to create the best cushioning in the universe. It has been tested against more than 30 other fabrics -- every towel we could find out there.  The Apollo Towel produces the right balance of softness, absorbency and quickness to dry — the most important attributes for any towel. Each thread is finer than one denier, having a diameter of less than ten micrometers giving each towel a lightweight and flexible shape. Providing anti-wrinkle properties while being extremely comfortable to touch. Finally this gives it efficient water benefits for use after every daily shower.  An unprecedented leap in features with mind‑blowing benefits you will enjoy daily. SOFTNESS: One of the softness materials every created-on earth, and beyond. Tested, Researched, Engineered. Softness: A key determining aspect of softness is the size of the fiber. Finer fibers are less likely to exert a concentrated force on our skin's surface receptors, whilst larger diameter fibers are more durable, so it's a balance.  In order to produce the best balanced towels that are both soft & durable, we've used a refined texture through advanced weaving techniques. Each towel is made from ultra-fine cotton / polyester mix yarn containing a superb air layer that has a light yet luxurious feel.  The manufacturing process brings out the natural softness of the material and makes them as soft and silky as cashmere, yet durable enough for everyday use. Making Apollo one of the softest towels ever. ABSORBS Up To 5 Times Its Own Weight In Water Cheap towels are typically not very absorbent and tend to produce excessive amounts of lint due to the use of uncombed cotton. Thanks to our XPLORE 11® fabric,  the Apollo Towel has the ability to rapidly absorb liquid. Helping remove that irritating and damp that’s synonymous with common towels. The result, the most absorbent towel hands down making you feel like an astronaut in your home.  SUPER STRONG FIBERS Although natural fibers of cotton are strong, they need a little help from polyester for structure and durability which ensures your towel lasts a lifetime. Using a higher quality yarn combined with a reinforced weave, Apollo Towels outlasts regular towels wash after wash.Long Lasting Towel: Survives wash after wash
 With the added benefit of REINFORCED DOUBLE STITCHING to ensure the highest durability of any towel ever. Odor-blocking: A towel that always feels freshly washed.  Apollo has odor-fighting technology derived from the slight mix of polyethylene which prevents smells.  FAST DRYING: 5 x Faster Than Any Regular Towel.  No one wants their towel to take forever to dry. Apollo Towels use high tech fabric that outperforms other bath towels. You'll find these towels are extremely fast-drying, allowing them to be ready between uses. Making them equally brilliant for travel, gym and home.    Our MissionWe use innovative materials, advanced construction & a timeless aesthetic to engineer scientifically better products.Who We AreA team of passionate people who enjoy science, innovation, space and pushing the boundaries of design. Together using our backgrounds, experience and networks to develop something truly unique and wonderful. Everything we do, we hope to inspire awe and delight. Look to the stars!Where We AreWe have a prototype that has been rigorously tested and perfected every step along the way. We have partnered with fabric designers, manufacturers, scientists and material suppliers. While building a great supply chain network.What We NeedThese funds will be used to develop and bring the Apollo Towels to YOU the backers. One small step for man, one giant leap for towel-kind! Mission is go!Houston we have a launch!  STRETCH GOALS    CARE: Wash with like colors with mild detergent cold. Tumble dry low or lay flat or line dry. Do not use fabric softener during wash as this may damage the water repellency. Do NOT bleach. Do NOT dry clean. Thanks for being apart of this interstellar journey! Love the APOLLO Team",55.0,0,"1 Campaign

They have decades of experience in the Ciscos, Accentures and Microsofts of the world. We are incubated in Australia’s top engineering and business university (University of New South Wales), have gone through several accelerator programs, are Australia’s Student Startup of the Year, are the winners of TEDxSydney’s Kickstart Competition (1st out of more than 1,000 applicants), Global Earth Tech finalists, and are IABCA’s Innovation of the Year, 2019-20.  We've also received several government, and not-for-profit, social enterprise, grants. And we've won several cash and in-kind prizes which have aided us in our journey.  These are only some of our highlights. Manufacturing and delivery We've got headquarters in North America, where our distribution centre is located. We also have impressive, active mentors who have run and delivered successful Kickstarter campaigns. Ex CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and national managers of Companies like Cisco advise us, and have advised us in securing supply chains during COVID-19.  Our manufacturing partners have been supplying hospitals, and hospital bed companies, for over 15 years. Our frame is guaranteed for 5 years, and our motors have standard 1-year warranties. We've worked with leading, national nursing home chains, (around the world), ICU doctors, and home care nurses to develop the BheemUP system.  Most importantly, patients and users with conditions ranging from back pain to heart failure were consulted, and have been trialling our products for more than 24 months now!We want to go to homes first, where we can test our algorithms en masse. And YOU will be part of that too, and receive lifetime updates by becoming a Kickstarter backer. All backers get lifetime subscriptions to our app.  One of our engineers at the OTEC Summit in China. He helped inspect our highly reputable manufacturing partner, who already supply several medical device products. For a full press kit - email us at info@bheemup.com",28.0,1,"1 Campaign

Our team has been on a mission to make that a reality, by creating the best air purification technology at a price point everyone can afford. And we’ve done it with Smartmi P1!

Our team at Smartmi relies on the proven HEPA Filtration Technology and made it better. P1 uses H13 True HEPA that is 3x times more effective than the traditional HEPA and unlike those air purifiers with UV-C lights, Smartmi P1 doesn't emission Ozone at all. You can trust Smartmi while it gets the job done.P1's filtration system consists of 4 stages unique layers. H13 level layer can breakdown and trap pollutants of up to 0.08µm. Its carbon-infused layer absorbing harmful particles and freshen up the air.Smartmi P1 actively monitors and cleans the air in your home by trapping 99.97% of particles that pass through the filter. It features a powerful 250m³/h CADR that purifies 200 sq. ft in 10 minutes. The air in your room can be cleaned 6+ times within 1 hour and cover up to 320 sq. ft. Specially designed for sensitive people, its dual laser particle sensors detect pollen & other harmful particles. In auto mode, Smartmi P1 will adjust the fan speed according to the real-time air quality, and it operates as quietly as only 19 dB.Smartmi P1 removes the most common allergens and harmful particles, including： 

P1’s latest certification from Intertek, a well-known English company that took our P1 for lab test runs and shows that P1 indeed has a CADR of 250. *Please note the CARD is calculated as FT³/Min, 1.67 should be multiplied when it is converted to m³/h. For Full Certifications Link: HERE.

Smartmi P1 gives you clean air that doesn't break the bank. The certified H13 True HEPA filter starts from $29 each, the clean healthy breathing for 6 to 12 months all at a budget-friendly price.No more hassle to open the case and touch the dirty filter. Twist ...and Pull! That's how you change the filter in Smartmi P1. Most air purifiers on the market come with only one type of filter trying to do a little bit of everything. But we know one filter can not do it all for everyone. Pick the filter that suits your needs. Whether you’re fighting allergies, pet odors, or dust and chemicals, Smartmi got you covered.Mighty powerful with a surging 250m³/h CADR and 99.97% super effective filtration, Smartmi P1 comes with a small footprint and it can comfortably sit on the countertops. We respect the atmosphere of your home and do not turn your sweet home into a medical institution with a giant purifier on the floor just for fresh air.Thanks to the 360° air inlet and a top air outlet, Smartmi P1 absorbs pollutants and blasts clean fresh air to every corner of the room with 250m³/h CADR. It cleans all the air in your room nonstop.  We all love plants. As well as enhancing your mood and creating a living space that is soothing to be in, plants can also help with loneliness and depression: caring for a living thing gives us a purpose and is rewarding — especially when you see that living thing bloom and thrive. But at that more rewarding moment, what about the pollen allergies they bring to you and your families?Smartmi P1 is equipped with dual laser particle sensors detecting both Pollen and PM2.5, updating you with the comprehensive analysis of air quality and preparing the information to optimize fan speed. Even you can see some of the dust under direct sunlight or UV lights, but most of the purifiers can only detect and purify according to the smaller particles - PM2.5. Study shows the particles like pollen which trigger the allergy symptoms are actually PM10. Those air purifiers always overlook that problem, let alone actively filtering them. 

With dual laser particle detections and a dedicated APP, Smartmi P1 will keep you updated with air quality insights and adjust the fan speed accordingly. Now you can sit back and enjoy the fresh air.

Thanks to the brushless DC motor and advanced wind tunnel design, Smartmi P1 operates as quietly as 19dB. Comparing to the industry average noise level of 40dB, you can enjoy the fresh air undisturbed.   

Smartmi P1 is the first portable smart air purifier that works seamlessly with all three major smart home systems. And now, a smart home can be a really enjoyable home with truly fresh air. Imagine your life with Smartmi, talking to your favorite voice assistant for real-time air quality alerts and remote controls.

Let's take a closer look at Smartmi P1. It is neatly constructed with a minimalistic design, metal body construction, and metallic finishes throughout. With the genuine leather strap on top and just the right size, you can place it anywhere, it blends right into your home decor.Now ditch those white plastic boxes which stand out in a bad way.

Meet the first ever Dome® Shower - a full shower experience with 75% less water.We think this is the simplest and nicest extreme saving shower experience yet.With Altereds new Dome® technology we create something never seen before; a rotating water dome that makes it possible to use less water without compromising.Saving water is a necessity since it is a finite resource. But by saving water you also save energy and in turn reduce your carbon footprint. So using the Altered:Shower is a great experience for you, and even better for the planet. Savings calculated on a household consumption of 420 Liters/day, of which 25% is in showers.Scientist today agree we have no more than 10 years before we see effects of climate change that are irreversible. We believe future solutions will help solve these issues, but most new technologies are complex. That means they will take time to develop, fund, test and implement. So, it will take time before they have penetrated the market to actually make an impact. It is time we do not have.We develop very simple solutions, that everyone can use, and that are possible to implement right now. And that is why WWF named us Climate Solver 2018. Because then – together – we will have a huge impact. And we will turn the tide on water stress and climate change. Not in 10 years, but today.So please help us spread the word! With the Altered:Shower we set out to create a sustainable, beautiful and affordable showering experience. To achieve this we developed a completely new shower technology: The Dome®.With the Dome Technology the water comes out in a high speed rotating dome shape.  The rotation in the dome tears the water apart. Creating thousands of large droplets in high speed. Giving you the coverage and pressure you want. It also transfers heat very effectively. So you can have a nice hot shower without touching the thermostat.Slow motion capture of DomeTo show the rotation in the Dome, we used a stroboscope when filming it in action. The result is clear, and quite beautiful if we may say so ourselves. The water rotates and is then torn apart into large droplets with high speed.This  allows us to use the water more efficiently and make it possible to use 75% less water, without loosing functionality.We have worked intensively to figure out what makes a great shower. It boils down to three things: Coverage, Pressure and Heat. Our Dome technology achieves this as effectively as possible, using as little water and energy as we can. This is how it works.Coverage — The rotation in the dome results in the water being torn apart, creating thousands of large droplets with high mass. This means you get really wet. It also spreads the water in a random pattern, giving you full coverage.  Pressure — We do the opposite from traditional water saving showers that  reduce the flow and therefore the speed of the water. We increase the speed of the water. Achieving both the pressure sensation and functionality in rinsing.Heat — Droplets cool more rapidly than a stream of water. But since the water is connected through the Dome, the heat is transferred very efficiently out to the droplets. Resulting in a nice warm shower without the need to touch your thermostat.We wanted to create a shower that was something extra to make sure it did not end up as a good intention in a drawer. Therefore we added features that would make you want to use it again and again. Monsoon mode – For a luxury experience, and superior rinsing, we added the Monsoon mode. By flicking a switch, we add water into the dome creating a monsoon rain experience. With the Monsoon mode you get absolutely drenched, but you are still saving 50% of both water and energy.Simple Installation – We wanted to create a simple product so that many people can use it. Therefore we have developed a shower handle. You simply screw it on your existing shower hose in a matter of seconds, and you are good to go. (For those of you who only have a shower head - we have a solution for you as well. Read more about it under installation). Beautiful Design – And of course, products need to look and feel great. That’s why the Altered:Shower is constructed of aluminum and stainless steel giving you a solid feeling and making it last forever.Creating a full shower experience with 75% less water was no easy task. A shower is more than a functional event, it is a sensory experience and a vital part of our daily routine. It was very important to us to create a shower that would not feel like a compromise.Our starting point was to develop a shower with our atomization technology which transforms the water flow into a high speed mist. It proved hard to apply in a shower without losing functionality. The mist has a tendency to fly away, soaking down the bathroom, and  the droplets are so small that they quickly lose heat. We then started to test our newly developed Dome technology. It proved to be a superior experience to the atomization. It holds the water together, creates larger droplets and retains the heat in a more efficient way.With the dome technology we made sure that all of the water exiting the shower is used for cleaning your body, not running down the drain or soaking your bathroom. We have tested hundreds of iterations of the dome technique, changing the angles, speed and droplet size of the water. What we have landed in is a beautiful dome shape that saves water but still gets the job done.Example of some prototypes of different Dome configurationsAfter several shower tests with a variety of test subjects. We realized that people have different expectations on the shower experience. From your everyday morning soak, post workout cleanse, a  luxurious week-end experience or a superior rinsing effect. That is why we made the addition of the monsoon mode. This gives all members of your household the shower they want, when they want it. Three years ago, Kickstarter made it possible for us to develop our first product. The Altered:Nozzle – Same tap 98% less water. We were three passionate people with a great idea, but not enough funding. We decided to turn to Kickstarter to make our vision a reality. We were not certain of success. But the campaign exceeded our expectations, and then things went crazy!To be honest our first campaign was difficult. Setting up production, logistics and distribution in a short amount of time. We had challenges, but we worked through them and made sure to deliver all of our rewards. It took some time and iterations, but now we are very proud of the company and the products that we have built.We made sure to listen to all the feedback we got from the Kickstarter community and other customers, and we have continuously made our Nozzles better. We’ve launched new versions. All together we have now delivered 90.000 nozzles to every corner of the world. And today our community saves more than 1 billion liters of water and 7.500 tons of CO2 every year. All thanks to the start that you gave us! Along the way we’ve also been lucky to receive awards like being named WWF climate solver 2018, Runner-Up Global water start ups Imagine H2O, SME Innovation by European Water Plattform, Impact 100 in the Nordics and we are one of the 1000 verified Solar Impuls Solutions that can be key in battling climate change.Access to fresh water is a necessity for all life on earth. Yet today water stress is a global issue affecting over two billion people. And an estimated three billion in 2020.  WWF estimates that 75% will be faced with water shortages by 2025 (WWF, World Wildlife  Foundation, Global threats 2019). It is a problem we need to do something about.SOURCE: https://worldwater.io/To sustain our way of living, water need to be pumped, treated, transported and heated. A vast amount of energy is used to achieve this. Therefore water has a large carbon footprint. This is yet another reason to make sure that we do not use more water than we need and that every drop counts!Imagine if we could install the Altered:Shower in all households in Europe and US? We would save 18 billion liters of water and 147 million tons of CO2 every year. That is the same as the emissions from 33 million cars driven for a year or planting 2,5 billion trees.It is a small product that has the potential to have a huge impact, please support us and contribute to that change!Installing the Altered:Shower is super simple. Our handle fits the standard shower hose and takes seconds to install. You just unscrew your existing handle and replace it with the Altered:Shower. We have also put together an Altered:Shower kit for those of you who only have a shower head. This kit includes a shower diverter, a hose and a shower holder. This solution is also super simple to install . You simply screw it on before your current shower head. Now you have the added option of a shower handle. But if you want you can still switch back to your regular shower head.

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Cooking by exact temperature is the next stage in cooking evolution.</span></p>
<p>The sprung, direct contact temperature sensor continually monitors the pan temperature as you cook.  The Tempo then regulates the power to maintain your desired temperature. This ensures you get consistent results and helps you to refine your recipes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s6.gifyu.com/images/B-Pan-temp-control.gif"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Tempo is designed to compliment your everyday cooktop, rather than replace it, giving you additional precise temperature control over your cooking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>SOUS-VIDE, SLOW COOK AND DEEP FRYING MODES</h3>
<p>Preset modes pair with temperature probes to perfect the most adventurous recipes possible. </p>
<p><strong>Sous-vide</strong> was once the preserve of professional kitchens, but thanks to the Tempo’s ability to set and maintain specific temperatures using a feedback loop, it’s easy to create melt-in-the-mouth Asian pork belly, Korean beef short ribs and tender teriyaki salmon at home.  The water circulator and probe simply combine to turn your pan into a water bath, perfect for gentle cooking.</p>

<h3>DESIGN &amp; DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>We have worked tirelessly for 3 years developing the Njori Tempo, using all our previous experience and design expertise.</p>
<p>The mechanical design has been done in house and we've been working with experienced electronics engineers in developing both the power and control electronics in parallel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624530295/a9b9du6qmwohysess7zn.jpg"" src=""""/><i>Early testing of the electronics control system</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In developing the temperature feedback (PID) loop, we also developed our own software called 'Njori Labs'. The video below shows how we used Njori labs to test and refine the different cooking methods before the full user interface and magnetic control dial were added. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""564"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/567248576"" width=""640""></iframe></div> <p></p>
<p>Every aspect of the user experience has been considered when designing the Tempo, from the design of the on screen interface, to the feel of the magnetic dial and buttons. We have tried to ensure the product is a joy to use from start to finish so you can discover your potential and fine tune the recipes you’re most passionate about. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>At Njori, our mission is to help people take their cooking to the next level.</p>
<p>Njori was founded by Design Engineers, Jack Raison and Nick Orme. We have worked together for several years in the tech development industry, designing and developing products for a variety of companies.  After discovering a shared love for cooking, we decided to use our expertise to develop and manufacture our own product.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thanks for your support!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We wanted to say a special thank you to all our supporters, investors, friends and family who've helped us get to this stage. We couldn't have done it without you!</p>
<p>We're excited to see the Njori community grow so please share with any fellow cooking enthusiasts and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We have been working on the Tempo for around three years and during that time we've done everything we can to reduce risk by ensuring all elements are properly developed and tested. We also have a track record of developing products for manufacture for other companies and brands and so following best practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Production</strong></p>
<p>We have a shortlist of our final suppliers lined up and have back up options for all individual components should we have any issue with delays of specific parts. We are waiting for Covid restrictions to lift to visit our suppliers in person before making the final decision.</p>
<p>We have used our previous experiences to ensure DFM (design for manufacture) stages are complete and all parts and components have been considered for mass manufacture and assembly. We have also checked capacities and are confident all suppliers can cope with production at scale should we surpass our goals.</p>
<p>We have confidence in our projected timelines but as with all hardware development projects, delays can happen due to unforseen circumstances so we have added buffer where possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Supply Chain Risk</strong></p>
<p>We identified a shortage in microchips (an issue worldwide due to Covid) a few months ago and placed an order for more than one years worth of the chips we need. We are expecting the long lead times here to be reduced, as has been the case with other microchips but we are keeping in regular contact with our suppliers and will monitor the situation carefully. We have managed to procure a smaller supply of chips, meaning all regular testing and our pilot run up until final production will still be possible.</p>
<p>We also have a wider procurement team and expert advisors on hand to discuss strategy should we have any unexpected shortages. If this happens, we'll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Njori was founded over a love of great food and great design. As product designers and keen cooks we faced a common problem when experimenting with new recipes and techniques - lack of accuracy, and too many single use kitchen gadgets taking up space in our kitchens.  This dilemma got our design and development brains thinking: why isn’t there a single product that offers complete control with endless possibilities to experiment, yet comes in a streamlined design that takes up a fraction of cupboard space? The idea of the Njori Tempo was born! 
 

 
 
PRECISE PAN TEMPERATURE CONTROL
Cooking by exact temperature is the next stage in cooking evolution.
The sprung, direct contact temperature sensor continually monitors the pan temperature as you cook.  The Tempo then regulates the power to maintain your desired temperature. This ensures you get consistent results and helps you to refine your recipes.
 

 
The Tempo is designed to compliment your everyday cooktop, rather than replace it, giving you additional precise temperature control over your cooking.
 
 
SOUS-VIDE, SLOW COOK AND DEEP FRYING MODES
Preset modes pair with temperature probes to perfect the most adventurous recipes possible. 
Sous-vide was once the preserve of professional kitchens, but thanks to the Tempo’s ability to set and maintain specific temperatures using a feedback loop, it’s easy to create melt-in-the-mouth Asian pork belly, Korean beef short ribs and tender teriyaki salmon at home.  The water circulator and probe simply combine to turn your pan into a water bath, perfect for gentle cooking.
 

 

 
Deep frying also uses the probe accessory, attaching easily to the side of your pan. The probe automatically corrects the temperature as you place cold ingredients into the pan making it a breeze to rustle up crunchy fried chicken, light and crispy tempura prawns or delicious doughnuts with confidence. 
 

 
Nothing beats the flavour slow cooking imparts – but heavy slow cookers take up valuable cupboard space. You can serve succulent stews or casseroles using your pan of choice with the Njori Tempo in slow cook mode. 
You can even place the probe into a piece of meat and set the ideal temperature to ensure it's cooked to perfection!
 

 
 
BUILT IN SCALES
Integrated scales also allow you to weigh ingredients before and during cooking and equally portion up the final creation.
The scales also allow you to use the reduce by weight function, ideal for bringing new consistency to sauces and reductions.
 

 
 
INSTANT CONTROL
Straight out of the box, the magnetic dial gives the user instant control over pan temperature, via the direct contact temperature sensor in the center of the glass. This means you're safe in the knowledge that whatever you put in the pan, the cooker has you covered. 
 

 
Our patent pending dial has been configured to give you effortless and instant control. With a built in button it makes selecting your mode of choice even easier.
 

 
 
COMPACT DESIGN
The Njori Tempo has an extremely sleek and compact design.  This makes the Tempo easy to store or transport. Accessories and cables tidy away neatly in the cork base, which is held closed by powerful magnets.
This was a high priority when first designing the product. When in use it won’t take up valuable space on your worktop and when not in use, it can be stored on a bookshelf alongside your favourite cookbooks.
 

 

 
 
FEATURES
The Njori Tempo comes complete with all the accessories you need to cook like a pro. 
 

 
 
TECH SPECS

 

 
 
DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT
We have worked tirelessly for 3 years developing the Njori Tempo, using all our previous experience and design expertise.
The mechanical design has been done in house and we've been working with experienced electronics engineers in developing both the power and control electronics in parallel. 
 
Early testing of the electronics control system
 
In developing the temperature feedback (PID) loop, we also developed our own software called 'Njori Labs'. The video below shows how we used Njori labs to test and refine the different cooking methods before the full user interface and magnetic control dial were added. 
 
Every aspect of the user experience has been considered when designing the Tempo, from the design of the on screen interface, to the feel of the magnetic dial and buttons. We have tried to ensure the product is a joy to use from start to finish so you can discover your potential and fine tune the recipes you’re most passionate about. 
 

 

 
 
TIMELINE
 

 
 
TEAM
 

 
At Njori, our mission is to help people take their cooking to the next level.
Njori was founded by Design Engineers, Jack Raison and Nick Orme. We have worked together for several years in the tech development industry, designing and developing products for a variety of companies.  After discovering a shared love for cooking, we decided to use our expertise to develop and manufacture our own product.
 
Thanks for your support!
 
We wanted to say a special thank you to all our supporters, investors, friends and family who've helped us get to this stage. We couldn't have done it without you!
We're excited to see the Njori community grow so please share with any fellow cooking enthusiasts and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
 
 
Risks and challenges
We have been working on the Tempo for around three years and during that time we've done everything we can to reduce risk by ensuring all elements are properly developed and tested. We also have a track record of developing products for manufacture for other companies and brands and so following best practice.
 
Production
We have a shortlist of our final suppliers lined up and have back up options for all individual components should we have any issue with delays of specific parts. We are waiting for Covid restrictions to lift to visit our suppliers in person before making the final decision.
We have used our previous experiences to ensure DFM (design for manufacture) stages are complete and all parts and components have been considered for mass manufacture and assembly. We have also checked capacities and are confident all suppliers can cope with production at scale should we surpass our goals.
We have confidence in our projected timelines but as with all hardware development projects, delays can happen due to unforseen circumstances so we have added buffer where possible.
 
Supply Chain Risk
We identified a shortage in microchips (an issue worldwide due to Covid) a few months ago and placed an order for more than one years worth of the chips we need. We are expecting the long lead times here to be reduced, as has been the case with other microchips but we are keeping in regular contact with our suppliers and will monitor the situation carefully. We have managed to procure a smaller supply of chips, meaning all regular testing and our pilot run up until final production will still be possible.
We also have a wider procurement team and expert advisors on hand to discuss strategy should we have any unexpected shortages. If this happens, we'll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.
 
Quality Control and Testing
We plan to do extensive testing with our beta units. This will involve initially using a 3rd party test house to ensure all electronics and mechanical components are pushed to their limits. Once certification is complete and the product has passed regulatory testing we will be offering our community the chance to become beta testers.
If there are any changes to our projected timeline, we’ll be sure to let you know as soon as we can.
 
Environmental commitments
Long-lasting design
We will be doing accelerated lifecycle testing to ensure the product will be long lasting. We have also designed our product to have a built in USB stick and port for software updates and diagnostics. This means we can push out updates and upgrades to ensure our product software stands the test of time.",20.0,1,"1 Campaign

Its a hydroponic pot, which means it grows plants like chilies, herbs and tomatoes without soil. It waters the plants automatically.  Leave it for a month and get back to a healthy plant.Botanium was first revealed on Kickstarter early 2017. In only 5 days we were fully funded with 1420 backers from all over the world. In the end of same year we shipped around 2500 units to 65 different countries. We are now ready to launch our second product - Botanium Vega. 
 Botanium Vega is minimalistically designed self-watering planter that enables you to grow herbs and veggies using soil-less growing technology. Plant a seed, plug it in and you can leave it alone for weeks as it takes care of the plant for you. You get more productive plants and there is no need to worry about over or under watering, the most common ways to kill plants. 
 There is a rising demand for ways to grow your own food. In a modern busy life, tending to a plant’s needs might be your last priority. And even if you do have time, you might not know how to keep it alive. Enjoy growing herbs or chili without effort. Botanium Vega takes care of the plant for you, thanks to automated, soil-free growing. Botanium Vega comes with a wider design than its predecessor with room for up to four plants.  
  Built-in water tank with automatic wateringVega features a water tank with room for 5 liter (1.3 gallon) of water. Compared with our first Botanium, this is 5x the volume and 25% more water per plant. (if you grow four plants in it). Thanks to this, the water lasts for many weeks.Vega automatically waters your plants multiple times per day. We have also made it possible to change this schedule so that you can make it water every hour or just once every day.  Soil-less gardening - more productive plantsBotanium Vega uses soil-less - so called hydroponic - gardening technology to grow plants from seed. This has many advantages - the plants can grow larger using less roots, and they will also regrow quicker after harvest.This also enables the Vega to automatically water the plants without needing to measure the moisture in the soil. App connectivity + built-in lampBy popular request, our new Botanium Vega is connected to your smartphone using the Botanium app. Use it to get notifications when you need to refill it, and to monitor your Botanium when you are away from home.We also include a powerful 20 watt LED growing light that enables you to grow anywhere - even during the dark winter. It can be adjusted in height and controlled through the Botanium app. 
 Hydroponics is simply growing without soil. The roots need water, nutrients and oxygen, all of which can be provided in a more efficient way than in soil. Botanium's porous growing medium absorbs a lot of water, while also providing an aerated environment for the roots. The benefits of this are not only quicker growth and more control, but also a simpler approach to growing. The great thing about hydroponics is that you can never overwater the plants you grow. Therefore, you don't need to take into account things like letting the soil dry out before watering again (and not waiting too long so your plants wilt).  All you need to do is to fill the reservoir when you see the water level getting low. The water lasts several week (depending on the plant, light and heat) > At Botanium, we believe that gardening should be simple and available to everyone, even to those living in a city or without much time to take care of a plant. We want to change how greens and herbs are produced indoors, making it possible to bring out the gardener in everyone. Grow basilBasil grows quite fast and is a good alternative for the impatient grower. As it needs a lot of water, it thrives in the Botanium where it gets watered often and evenly.Grow tomatoesLike its' relatives chili peppers, potatoes and tobacco, tomatoes originate from South America. It is a fast growing plant that thrives in hydroponic systems like Botanium.Grow chiliWhat makes chili growing so rewarding is that even a small amount of chili lasts a long time – in contrast to strawberries for instance, which you easily can eat faster than it grows.You can also grow rocket salad, thyme, oregano, strawberries, mint and much much more.How to start growing
Plant a seed in the growing medium
Fill the water tank with water
Add the included nutrients
Connect the Botanium Vega to electricity
Let Botanium Vega take care of the plants for you

 
Botanium Vega features a 20 watt growing light that is adjustable in height. So as your plants grow you can unscrew the knob and adjust the light accordingly.The lamp is equipped with state-of-the-art LEDs that are attached to a lamp screen made of extruded aluminum. This screen does not only eliminates glare, but also works as a powerful heatsink that makes it possible to run the LEDs cool - making them run efficently at 175 lumen per watt.The lamp can be removed if you have a sunny window and you don't need the extra light.   

 When talking with Botanium users, it was clear that a highly requested feature was app connectivity. And we listened! From the very start, it was important for us to make an app only if it made sense, and if it could be useful. We didn't want to create an app that is just another gimmick. The Botanium Vega has optimized default settings in place that doesn't require you to use the app - but it does add extra controls and features.The Botanium app is connected to Vega with wi-fi, so you can keep track of your grow wherever you are.Water levelKeep track of the current water level and get notified when the water level runs low. If you plan to be away from home a few weeks, you can easily check if you need to refill before leaving.Nutrients Different kind of plants have different nutrient demands. The Botanium app calculates the right amount of nutrient based on the plants you grow. Specify what you grow, and it will tell you how much nutrients you need to add each time you refill the water.LampTurn the lamp on and off from your couch. You can also schedule when the lamp turns on or off, so that you don't need to be disturbed by it early in on a sunday morning.  
 Botanium is designed in Sweden, a country that embodies the Scandinavian design movement. This style – often referred to as minimalist – developed during the Second World War, with clean, simple lines and a strong emphasis on functionality. A common theme in this tradition is that beautiful and functional objects should be available to all.  Botanium Vega consists of a 5 liter water tank and a growing container. A water pump moves water up to top, and distributes it evenly over the growing medium. It trickles down and returns back to the water tank, so it later can be reused. Dimensions: 530 mm (20,9"") x 145 mm (5,7"") x 200 mm (7.9"") (without lamp)Color: White (if the stretch goal is achieved, two additional colors will be unlocked.)Plug: Vega will be shipped with plugs for Europe, US, UK and Australia/New Zealand.Power: 12VLamp: 20 w LED light, 200 ppfd @ 100 mmConnectivity: Wi-fiUsage: Indoor use only
   We have been testing several functioning prototypes over the last year to make sure that it works as intended. Since Vega is the evolution of our first product, we have applied what we have learned from that and improved it.It is important to us that it does not only work as intended and looks good, but also that the design is user-friendly and intuitive.
 Botanium was founded in Stockholm in 2016 by a group of designers and engineers with a passion for creating innovative products that enable everyone to grow their own food without compromising their modern lifestyle. We strive to accelerate and simplify urban gardening, enabling everyone to be a grower.  We are glad to have such a competent team that can make Botanium Vega a reality!

<h2>Breathe new life into your living room. </h2>
<h3>Or your bedroom. Or your office. Or your patio. Or wherever.</h3>
<p>Have you ever experienced immersive digital art? If so, you probably already know how transformative and transportive it can be. If not, you are the reason we created Fluora.</p>
<p>We like to use the analogy of traditional lighting being like Tetris or Pacman, and 3D lighting being like Fortnite or Minecraft. It’s nearly impossible to imagine the latter by looking at the former. </p>
<p>We designed Fluora to be the perfect companion from morning until night, and to elevate everyday moments and rituals. It’s great for social gatherings, movie screenings, dinner parties, date nights. The list goes on (and on).</p>
<p>In the age of remote work, Fluora also creates an incredible productive and motivating home office environment. And because LED light can promote a healthy circadian rhythm, it also offers many body and mind enhancing benefits.</p>
<p>That means Fluora can help you wake up and focus, as well as relax and sleep.</p>

<h2>Feel the creative power at your fingertips. </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Fluora isn’t just a lighting fixture. It’s a canvas—your canvas. We’ve made it possible for you to curate and fine tune your vibe from a library of animations, all from your mobile phone.</p>
<p>As experiential designers, we also understand that the key to a transcendent experience is great content. That’s why every animation you’ll experience is specially hand-crafted for Fluora by our artists and engineers.</p>
<p>But we didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>What makes Fluora’s animations special is that they are not driven by videos or other pre-rasterized assets. Since they are algorithmic by nature, each pattern is responsive in real-time, and rendered with infinite resolution and color fidelity.</p>
<p>Every pattern also has parameters that can alter its behavior, from speed and color to ‘bounce’ and ‘sparkly-ness.’ You can even layer patterns and effects together to create more complex looks. A whole digital universe is truly at your command.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605678150/hnznp4la7zvq5cyhjhgm.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>The future of home lighting is bright. </h2>
<p>To realize the vision we had for Fluora, we didn’t just have to build the world’s first 3D home lighting product. We also had to bring a true 3d LED animation engine into the product.</p>
<p>We call it <strong>Photon™</strong>.</p>
<p>Beyond customization, Photon will make it possible to seamlessly integrate Fluora with existing lighting systems in your home. That means you can control and customize all your light fixtures, including Fluora, as if they were a single unit.</p>
<p>Thanks to Photon, every Fluora plant is also able to run its own animations locally. This virtually eliminates latency, and allows for blazing-fast refresh rates. But that’s just the beginning of our plans for Photon.</p>
<p>In the future, our software platform will give you the power to design your own multisensory experiences. Imagine synchronizing your Spotify, Peloton, or Calm account with Fluora. We also envision Photon learning your preferences over time, enabling automated and predictive lighting.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s8.gifyu.com/images/Fluora-GIF-011-C.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Design is an iterative process. </h2>
<p>Our creative process revolves around working with talented artists and designers to create a shared vision of what we want to build, then bringing in our engineering and production team to execute on that vision. The spark that ignited Fluora was a picture of a Monstera plant in a friend’s apartment.</p>
<p>Conversation quickly turned into collaboration, and it wasn’t long before we had our first renderings. The idea was to develop a simple, nature-inspired design that would cleverly conceal the plant’s electronics. Easier said than prototyped.</p>
<p>For the stems, that meant finding the perfect fabrication partners to get the overall look, layout, and finish just right.</p>
<p>For the leaves, that meant experimenting with many different materials and form factors to find the optimal diffusion of light.</p>
<p>For the lights, that meant testing countless LED types and configurations to ensure Fluora felt like a living, breathing piece of art.</p>
<p>With each prototype we built, we pushed the aesthetic and functional limits of every component forward, until we had realized our vision — a magical houseplant imbued with light.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Who We Are </h2>
<p>We are Color and Light, a collective of artists, designers, and engineers that create immersive and unforgettable experiences using state-of-the-art technology.</p>
<p>Artists from our studio have built public installations all across the globe, and delivered more than $10 million dollars worth of digital art to top tier clients like Google and Spotify.</p>
<p>We’ve partnered with organizations and artists at the apex of the entertainment, too, from Coachella and Burning Man to Diplo and Billie Eilish.</p>
<p>Of all the digital art we’ve brought to life over the years, nothing has moved our audiences more than our organic light installations. It was this work that set us on the path to create Fluora, and to launch this Indiegogo Campaign.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605678670/riapadxfv6jgickyyhoe.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>What Drives Us </h2>
<p>Thanks to the massive technological strides made over the past decade, digital art is now a $1 billion industry. Unfortunately, the vast majority of truly awe-inspiring installations are out of reach for the average person.</p>
<p>Think popup museums in Paris, and art festivals in the American West.</p>
<p>We set out on a mission to make this wonderful art form more accessible, particularly at a time when we’re spending more time at home, and there are fewer opportunities to enjoy public art together.</p>
<p>We started by looking at the existing market. To our surprise, there was no immersive LED art for the home, despite the exponential advancements made in lighting technology. So we got together, and got to work.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s8.gifyu.com/images/Fluora-Tree-GIF.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Why Indiegogo </h2>
<p>After countless hours spent tinkering and refining, we have our final prototype, and our supply partners are lined up. We chose Indiegogo for the Fluora presale, because we have always admired the energy and tenacity of its community.</p>
<p>That word, community, is at the heart of what we do.</p>
<p>As a collective of creators, we’ve always believed that great art (and great technology) can bring people closer together. We truly believe Fluora has the potential to do exactly that, and we cannot wait for you to get your hands on it.</p>

As experiential designers, we also understand that the key to a transcendent experience is great content. That’s why every animation you’ll experience is specially hand-crafted for Fluora by our artists and engineers.
But we didn’t stop there.
What makes Fluora’s animations special is that they are not driven by videos or other pre-rasterized assets. Since they are algorithmic by nature, each pattern is responsive in real-time, and rendered with infinite resolution and color fidelity.
Every pattern also has parameters that can alter its behavior, from speed and color to ‘bounce’ and ‘sparkly-ness.’ You can even layer patterns and effects together to create more complex looks. A whole digital universe is truly at your command.


The future of home lighting is bright. 
To realize the vision we had for Fluora, we didn’t just have to build the world’s first 3D home lighting product. We also had to bring a true 3d LED animation engine into the product.
We call it Photon™.
Beyond customization, Photon will make it possible to seamlessly integrate Fluora with existing lighting systems in your home. That means you can control and customize all your light fixtures, including Fluora, as if they were a single unit.
Thanks to Photon, every Fluora plant is also able to run its own animations locally. This virtually eliminates latency, and allows for blazing-fast refresh rates. But that’s just the beginning of our plans for Photon.
In the future, our software platform will give you the power to design your own multisensory experiences. Imagine synchronizing your Spotify, Peloton, or Calm account with Fluora. We also envision Photon learning your preferences over time, enabling automated and predictive lighting.

 
Design is an iterative process. 
Our creative process revolves around working with talented artists and designers to create a shared vision of what we want to build, then bringing in our engineering and production team to execute on that vision. The spark that ignited Fluora was a picture of a Monstera plant in a friend’s apartment.
Conversation quickly turned into collaboration, and it wasn’t long before we had our first renderings. The idea was to develop a simple, nature-inspired design that would cleverly conceal the plant’s electronics. Easier said than prototyped.
For the stems, that meant finding the perfect fabrication partners to get the overall look, layout, and finish just right.
For the leaves, that meant experimenting with many different materials and form factors to find the optimal diffusion of light.
For the lights, that meant testing countless LED types and configurations to ensure Fluora felt like a living, breathing piece of art.
With each prototype we built, we pushed the aesthetic and functional limits of every component forward, until we had realized our vision — a magical houseplant imbued with light.

Fluora Daytime Shot

 
Who We Are 
We are Color and Light, a collective of artists, designers, and engineers that create immersive and unforgettable experiences using state-of-the-art technology.
Artists from our studio have built public installations all across the globe, and delivered more than $10 million dollars worth of digital art to top tier clients like Google and Spotify.
We’ve partnered with organizations and artists at the apex of the entertainment, too, from Coachella and Burning Man to Diplo and Billie Eilish.
Of all the digital art we’ve brought to life over the years, nothing has moved our audiences more than our organic light installations. It was this work that set us on the path to create Fluora, and to launch this Indiegogo Campaign.

What Drives Us 
Thanks to the massive technological strides made over the past decade, digital art is now a $1 billion industry. Unfortunately, the vast majority of truly awe-inspiring installations are out of reach for the average person.
Think popup museums in Paris, and art festivals in the American West.
We set out on a mission to make this wonderful art form more accessible, particularly at a time when we’re spending more time at home, and there are fewer opportunities to enjoy public art together.
We started by looking at the existing market. To our surprise, there was no immersive LED art for the home, despite the exponential advancements made in lighting technology. So we got together, and got to work.

Why Indiegogo 
After countless hours spent tinkering and refining, we have our final prototype, and our supply partners are lined up. We chose Indiegogo for the Fluora presale, because we have always admired the energy and tenacity of its community.
That word, community, is at the heart of what we do.
As a collective of creators, we’ve always believed that great art (and great technology) can bring people closer together. We truly believe Fluora has the potential to do exactly that, and we cannot wait for you to get your hands on it.

Traditional wireless security cameras and other smart home gadgets like your Echo all use plain old 802.11b/g/n WiFi which you'll also find in your laptop and smartphone. If you've ever noticed your WiFi doesn't cover the basement or the yard, you'll understand why regular WiFi security cameras also struggle to cover a big area.   To power our cameras we use our patented SkyLine technology that's built on WiFi HaLow. WiFi HaLow is a new standard that easily penetrates thick walls and has a much longer range than ordinary WiFi technology. In fact, the Scenes One camera has a range of 5400sq. ft<around 540 sq. meter>! That means you can easily monitor your entire property without the need for wires or WiFi repeaters. Which, by the way, you can do both day and night since we also added night vision to our cameras. 5400sq. ft Coverage and Strong wall penetration Let's compare that to the other guys, we've installed our leading competitors in a car and took them all for a ride.    Well, it's actually 2.5 times compare with the normal 2.4G WiFi. Yeah, that's serious reach.    But the range isn't all that matters, as you know from your home WiFi, walls can stop the signal reach other floors and create dead spots. WiFi HaLow is uniquely better equipped at blasting through walls, giving you perfect coverage, even where your home WiFi doesn't reach. Private & Secure Network It's also much faster than other cameras because it doesn't compete for the same WiFi bandwidth that the rest of your devices are on.  SkyLine technology offers a dedicated fast-track lane for your data to quickly and securely travel between the camera and gateway without sharing the same bandwidth with other devices.   Lower Power Consumption And all of that while only using the same power that a Bluetooth device would, giving you solid 6-month battery life on the rechargeable Li-Ion battery. With an added solar panel you'll never have to recharge ever again.Just install once and you're done!  5 minutes Automatic Setup Scenes One cameras communicate directly and exclusively with the Scenes Cube Gateway, creating a private and secure network only between Scenestek devices. This makes setup completely automatic, just plug in the gateway using ethernet, and tap the activation button, no passwords or QR codes. The Scenes One cameras and the gateway automatically recognize each other and pair effortlessly.    In addition to our unique WiFi HaLow powered technology, we also created a host of other features to make Scenestek cameras the best choice to protect your home.Nightvision Built-in infrared night vision ensures you'll be able to see in the dark, but others can't see you looking. The infrared light is not visible to the human eye, so even when it's pitch black, you'll see with total clarity what's going on.  WaterproofScenestek cameras are waterproof and work come rain or shine. They are IP65 rated, including the solar panel. Full HD & 140° Field of View  Our custom-designed optics provide HD 1920 X 1080P resolution with a 140°  field of view, allowing you to see far and wide what's happening on your property. Whether there's someone at the door, or you want to check in on your loved ones, two-way audio lets you have a direct conversation through the Scenes One camera using the app. Simply tap the camera you want to talk through, and press to speak.  The Scenestek app lets you check in on your property anytime anywhere. We have secure US-based cloud storage with 7-day rolling free storage you can access through the app. This means you're able to rewatch any footage from up to 7 days ago. If you'd like to extend the storage period we'll offer affordable cloud plans.Within the app you can also activate the two-way audio, and set up alerts to notify you when the cameras detect activity. Scenestek cameras are easy and secure to install, either on a desktop or mounted on a wall.    We suggest setting them up within 10 ft / 3 meter of where you want the PIR motion sensor to pick up on humans in its proximity if you're using them at the front door for example.   After screwing them onto a wall or flat surface they are fixed and can't easily be taken down. Most other cameras use magnets to be fixed and are easily taken down by criminals (which really defeats the purpose if your security camera gets stolen).Power & chargingScenes One cameras can be charged with a standard Micro-USB cable and any regular USB charger, as you'd use for your phone.

 Scenes One is also compatible with Amazon Echo Show devices, giving you the option to check in on a specific camera with just a simple ""Alexa, show me the garage"". Here's what it looks like in action!And our app also works with IFTTT, giving you endless options to integrate Scenestek cameras with other smart home gadgets.     To test the range of Scenestek cameras vs. regular WiFi cameras, we've set up both our cameras and those of competitors in a park across a lake.The Gateway is set up on the bridge and we measured the maximum distance of our system.

Smart Display. Know your water temperature, total usage, and customized water flow.

Hygienic. Enjoy ultimate convenience and keep your hand clean without touching the faucet handle. 

Eco-Friendly. Save up to 30% of water and help the environment. 
   Have you ever washed your hands with a traditional faucet and thought, this doesn't make sense? You touch the handle with your dirty hands, wash your hands, and touch the dirty handle again with your freshly washed hands. So what was the point of washing them at all?    iFlow is a smart home device that provides an effective solution to wasted, leaking water. No longer worry about dirtying your hands right after you’ve washed them. iFlow is completely hands-free & automatic. Get rid of handles and switches⎯iFlow ""knows"" when you need water.   iFlow is completely powered by the flow of water. Every time you use iFlow, it charges simultaneously. In addition, it comes equipped with a backup battery inside just in case it goes unused for too long.   Know the water temperature and how much water you use. Set the amount of water and get no more or no less. The built-in smart display tells you everything about the water that you are using.   1. Smart Mode - Gives you water whenever you need it. You can now forget about handles or knobs. Just walk up to the sink and hold your hands under the faucet for water. When you’re done, just walk away and let iFlow stop the water without one wasted drop.  2. Non-stop Mode - Keeps the water flowing. We understand that sometimes you just want nonstop water. Just place your finger above the second sensor on the side of the smart display; once for non-stop water, twice to stop the water.  3. Customized Mode - Set the water to the amount you want. If you love cooking, iFlow is a must-have. Place your pot or any container under the faucet and set the amount of water with the smart display. Let iFlow fill the container to the exact amount while getting started on your other tasks.     It only takes 3 simple steps to set up iFlow:1. Unscrew the original faucet cap.2. Put on the iFlow ring and mount.3. Attach the iFlow.   Every iFlow reward package comes with a screw adapter.  With the adapters, iFlow fits on almost any faucet on the market.  Leaking water is causing massive waste annually. We understand that a leaky water tap can be a pain in the neck, and that's why we created iFlow⎯the smart-sensing faucet that completely changes the way you use water and makes your water smarter.  Unlike traditional faucets, iFlow cuts water usage significantly and stops water from leaking. We don't just want to sell you a product, we want to make a change to the world through our business. By ourselves, the effect is small. But with your help, together we can make a larger impact.   *For some of you who do not need the smart display and water flow customization, you may choose the iFlow K1, which is a simplified version of the iFlow without a display, with only smart mode and non-stop mode.      WHAT IT DOES1.

</div></div>","Temperature is crucial for a full experience of any grape or wine type but in traditional wine serving, there is no way to set the perfect serving temperature for different types of wine, all the way from champagne to your favourite red wines. 
GRAD NO.1 is a single bottle, rechargeable wine cooler that makes sure your wine keeps its temperature throughout the serving, allowing you to always drink wine at the ideal temperature and thereby taste the wine as it should be.  

Our team of highly experienced thermal engineers and designers have combined patented technology, great materials and Danish design to create the first battery-driven wine cooler with unmatched temperature precision - to serve the needs of people who care about their wine, and the ones they share it with.
With the Danish Design principles - simplicity, quality-focused and user-centric - as our backbone, we are bringing these advanced technologies to your table: 

Newest lithium-ion battery cells 

Electrical semiconductor spot cooling 
Vapour chamber heat dissipation system
4-sensor temperature control algorithm 
Advanced and energy-optimised cooling chamber temperature distribution 
Wireless charging  
User-friendly touch interface with continuous temperature feedback 

 

The temperature of your wine greatly affects what flavors and aromas you’ll taste and smell.  GRAD NO.1 makes sure that you are getting the best experience from all your wines. 

We spend money and time cooling and storing our wines at precise temperatures in a wine refrigerator, only for them to lose the intended serving temperature the second we take them out and start enjoying them.  We may use ice buckets, sleeves, or other cooling hacks, but nothing maintains that perfect temperature throughout the entire bottle. 




Take your wine out of the fridge and place the bottle in GRAD NO.1. 
Using the simple touch interface, adjust to your preferred temperature between 4-20°C (40-70°F).
 Enjoy your wine and its full range of flavours and aromas.

Depending on the temperature you choose, the battery lasts between 2-5 hours.  A battery indicator lets you know when you need to put your GRAD NO.1 on the wireless charging pad.
 
  


As a Danish company, we feel a duty to reflect Danish Design thinking and absorb its values in all our products.  Although our products are modernising typically traditional products, such as the ice bucket, we still want them to feel timeless, user oriented, simple and with good quality and durable materials.

<h3>Why is Aquibear so fast?</h3>
<p>Aquibear<strong> boils only the water you need.</strong> So there’s no wasting water and energy like you do when you boil a kettle and end up throwing much of the boiled water away. And because Aquibear removes the chlorine from the water, you get fresher, better-tasting tea and coffee every time,</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620712604/fgoy83fas1o7g7ouhmuk.png"" src=""""/></h3>

<h3>The power of reverse osmosis (RO)</h3>
<p>Aquibear uses the best water purification system you can get for your home. Did you know that not all water filter systems remove all the contaminants from your water? The best way to ensure the purest water is to use reverse osmosis.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620714828/nntroqkfbw1hrwnnecrs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It works by using pressure to push your water through the tiny pores of the membranes and carbon filters. These remove any chemicals and bacteria, leaving you with pure, delicious water that’s so refreshing to drink.</p>

<h3>Quality you can trust</h3>
<p>Remember, not all RO water filters are the same.</p>
<p>Aquibear uses<strong> the latest 3-stage RO filtering system, designed and manufactured by Hydranautics,</strong> one of the global leaders in membrane technology.</p>
<p>The filtering system rapidly and efficiently removes any chlorine, microplastics, lead, bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals from tap water.</p>

After our campaign launched, many backers request for mineral water, not just RO water. With only 109 USD, you can get 1 NF filter and 2 PPC filters. That’s 2 year package to get mineral water anytime in your home! Remember check out our add-on perks.



 
See the difference. Taste the difference.
Put tap water through the Aquibear RO water purifier, and you’ll get clean, safe, great-tasting water every time.
Using 3-stage reverse osmosis (RO) filter system, Aquibear removes over 99.9% of the nasties that could be lurking unseen in your tap water, such as chlorine, bacteria, microplastics, heavy metals, and other contaminants.
So you’re left with tasty and healthy water that you and your family can enjoy every day.

Boils water in just 3 seconds
In a rush? Want to grab a quick cup of tea or coffee before you go out? No more frustrations waiting for the kettle to boil. Aquibear puts the whole water boiling process on fast forward, so your water’s boiled and ready to make your delicious tea and coffee in just 3 seconds.

 
Cold and great-tasting water
World's first double-water-tank design. Compares to traditional water purifiers, Aquibear has two water tanks: a tap water tank and a flexible purify water tank. The purified water tank is slim and detachable. It can be easily put into the refrigerator, even in a mini-fridge.


Why is Aquibear so fast?
Aquibear boils only the water you need. So there’s no wasting water and energy like you do when you boil a kettle and end up throwing much of the boiled water away. And because Aquibear removes the chlorine from the water, you get fresher, better-tasting tea and coffee every time,


The power of reverse osmosis (RO)
Aquibear uses the best water purification system you can get for your home. Did you know that not all water filter systems remove all the contaminants from your water? The best way to ensure the purest water is to use reverse osmosis.

It works by using pressure to push your water through the tiny pores of the membranes and carbon filters. These remove any chemicals and bacteria, leaving you with pure, delicious water that’s so refreshing to drink.


Quality you can trust
Remember, not all RO water filters are the same.
Aquibear uses the latest 3-stage RO filtering system, designed and manufactured by Hydranautics, one of the global leaders in membrane technology.
The filtering system rapidly and efficiently removes any chlorine, microplastics, lead, bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals from tap water.

Cubbit is the distributed cloud - the next evolution of data storage.​ 
Cubbit lets you access and share your data from anyhwere, it’s easy-to-use and has all the features you’d expect.
Unlike any Cloud, Cubbit needs no data center — it runs on a peer-to-peer network of Cubbit Cells with over 3500 active nodes in 70+ countries, unlocking a unique set of features.


 


The Cubbit Cell is cloud storage that’s free, for life. Choose your Cell - 512 GB or 1TB - and you’re set for life. A one-off fee and then you never need to give us another dime.
 


On Cubbit you enjoy total privacy. No one else, not even us, can access your data – without your permission.Thanks to our zero-knowledge cryptographic architecture, it’s mathematically impossible for anyone to see your files. Read more here >
 


Your Cubbit Cell grows with you and your storage needs. Connect it to your router for up to 1TB of instant cloud storage.
Need more? Plug in any external storage device via USB and your cloud space will increase by 50% of the attached storage – up to a total of 4TB.
 


Create up to 4 independent Cloud accounts for every Cell. Each account is private, and you decide how much space it gets.
 


Cubbit makes your data indestructible.
With Cubbit you'll never lose a file again as your data is not inside your Cell, but encrypted, copied, and distributed over the network of Cubbit Cells.
No matter what happens to your Cell - a disconnection, a blackout, even a space invasion - your data is always safe and accessible.
 


Enjoy the fastest upload speed around. 
If you are connected to the same local network of a Cell - yours or someone else's - the upload is near-instantaneous since the Cell itself will take care of syncing the files to the cloud.  


Available as desktop applications for Windows 10, MacOS High Sierra and newer, Linux (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary, or other Debian-based) – and on any browser via our Web App. Mobile applications for iOS and Android will come out soon.

We are now ready to start manufacturing and mass production. We will start shipping our first product in September 2018.Please share your thoughts with us. And if you’re passionate about tea, please share our story with the world.          First and foremost, thanks to our parents, families and friends for supporting us since day one.

Research on the effects of polyphenols on human health has developed considerably in the past 10 years. It strongly supports a role for polyphenols in the prevention of degenerative diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and cancers.Reference 1: Applications and opportunities for ultrasound assisted extraction in the food industry Kamaljit Vilkhu, Raymond Mawson, Lloyd Simons, Darren Bates a Ultrasonics Processing Group, Food Science Australia; April 2007Reference 2: Impact of ultrasonic-assisted extraction on the chemical and sensory quality of tea Infusion.

They travel from one thing to another in a heart beat, just by opening doors, hanging onto the bus railing, working out at the gym, paying for coffee, and inevitably touching your belongings in between trips. Life gets busy and keeping your things clean 24/7 can be a pain.  We are thrilled to introduce you to the: Coral UV 2, the world’s first UV multitask device that sanitizes, filtrates, and smart-dries, all-in-one. In the last two years, we have listened to our backers and customers of generation one and from there we have been making improvements day by day.Coral UV 2 is now reborn with an eco-friendly UV-C LED technology that brings a more powerful, smarter, and safer sanitation on your everyday items in your living and working spaces.    Most sanitizers on the market just sanitize, but Coral UV 2 does more than that. In order to eliminate the harmful contaminants completely, it is reinforced to provide dual layers of protection for you and your family.  With science backed UV-C LED technology, Coral UV 2 kills up to 99.9% of harmful germs in just 10 minutes! We use 12mw LED lights which are SIX times more powerful than other LED sanitizers on the market.   Coral UV 2 captures 99% of airborne contaminants such as dirt, dust and vapor, ensuring that only clean air enters the sanitizer. Competitor UV sanitizers lack an optimal filtration system, exposing your belongings to harmful air pollutants and allergens.   Moisture is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Coral UV 2 features a function that dries washable items such as: baby bottles, CPAP masks, and toys. Our dryer ensures a safe temperature that reaches up to 140F/60C—dries perfectly without damaging your belongings. This feature operates separately from the ‘Sanitize Only’ function. You can sanitize only or sanitize and dry together.                While most competitors test only 1 kind of bacteria, Coral UV 2 has been independently tested against multiple kinds of germs and proven by third party lab tests. Our 268 nm UV-C LED is also ozone free, safe and durable to operate at home or workspace. CLICK HERE to find our lab reports.    Tired of not being able to clean all of your daily essentials in one cycle?  Coral UV 2's increased interior chamber will save you time, energy and the work of running multiple cycles! For a size reference, it now fits up to 11 Perrier water bottles (330ml/11oz) or 12 Dr Brown's bottles (8oz).                    Coral UV 2 fits all purposes. It can be used to sanitize your daily carry-ons such as wallet, keys, phone, mask, and this list goes on. It can also sanitize and dry washable items at the same time, such as baby bottles, shakers, cosmetic tools, utensils and more.                        
 
Coral UV 2 uses high performance UV-C LEDs that can run over 30,000 cycles. This is equivalent over 16 years of usage(1).  We have added moisture and surge protection to the LED bulbs along with an automatic cooling feature to ensure optimal and consistent performance throughout their life. You will never need to replace the LED bulbs. In any case where the bulbs do not operate, your kickstarter order comes with a lifetime product warranty and we will replace the product for FREE. Filter replacement is also free and covered for life!(2) (1) Assuming five 10-minute cycle are used per day.(2) Shipping cost may apply.Full terms can be found on Q&A.     Coral UV 2 comes with an operation window and a cycle indicator. The cycle indicator light lets you know when the device is in operation. While the window shines green, UV lights are on. When the window shines orange, it indicates the dryer is on.A lot of people ask us: How do I know when it's working? We have programmed the indicators to tell you when something is wrong. If you do not see any indicator lights through the window during a sanitizing or drying cycle, it means either the lights are out or the dryer has malfunctioned. If that's the case, reach out to us and we will send you a new one!  Mechanical safety switch automatically turns off the lights when the lid is open. Coral UV 2 mechanical switch does not wear out compared to the standard magnetic switches. Therefore, the safety mechanism will not deteriorate over time.  Child-proof filter locks prevents the little ones from accidentally opening the filter. To remove the filter, simply twist the arrow to the unlocked position with a coin or a flat object. To secure the filter, twist the arrow to point towards the locked position. And that’s it!

<p>At around 500 BC, Romans began making dipped candles from tallow. For more than two thousand and five hundred years, they've glowed by our side. Our persuasion for more lightness never stopped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first lighthouse in recorded history was Egypt’s Pharos of Alexandria. Built around 280 BC, the source of light was a huge open fire at its summit. Since then, the lighthouses built around the world have led countless people through the darkness. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, we introduce the Moonside Neon Lighthouse. Combining modern smart lighting technology and inspiration from the lighthouse architecture, we want this new kind of lighthouse to shine by your side. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Moonside team has extensive experience and resources in consumer electronics innovation and manufacturing. Since the beginning of our journey, we have shipped thousands of Moonside Lamp Ones around the world (Thank you to our lovely users!). We all have learned a lot, especially over the past year from the global supply chain disruption. The Moonside Neon Lighthouse has just completed the pre-production run successfully which means all major toolings and developments are already well finished. It is safe to say that we are now more confident than ever in bringing this awesome project to life, and we will ship the Moonside Neon Lighthouse to our backers both on time and with ensured quality.</p>
<p>We are sure that a lot of you guys have heard about global chip storage and supply chain issues caused by COVID-19. To avoid this problem early on, we have been stocking all the key components of our products to secure a safe level of inventory. Therefore, our manufacturing timeline is not impacted by those issues.</p>
<p>We have shipped to more than 30 different countries and are very experienced in global shipping. We have been working with reliable shipping carriers such as USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL, 4PX, Canada Post, Australia Post, Hermes, Yodel, and more. You will be able to track the entire shipping process of your package once they are shipped out from our warehouse.</p>

At around 500 BC, Romans began making dipped candles from tallow. For more than two thousand and five hundred years, they've glowed by our side. Our persuasion for more lightness never stopped.
 
The first lighthouse in recorded history was Egypt’s Pharos of Alexandria. Built around 280 BC, the source of light was a huge open fire at its summit. Since then, the lighthouses built around the world have led countless people through the darkness. 
 
Today, we introduce the Moonside Neon Lighthouse. Combining modern smart lighting technology and inspiration from the lighthouse architecture, we want this new kind of lighthouse to shine by your side. 
 

 
 



 




 

 


 
 







 
 
 

 

 

Dynamic RGB Color-Zones Technology:  The Moonside Neon Lighthouse has 90 individually addressable LED pixels. You can paint them with any color you want with the Moonside smartphone app. 
 

360-Degree Viewing Angle: To make the Neon Lighthouse look awesome from every angle, our team has developed a preparatory lighting-diffusion technology that prevents any dark spots from appearing on the illuminating body.  
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

Full-color spectrum and high CRI LED to make the Moonside Neon Lighthouse a perfect RGB backlight for your creative photography works.

Risks & Challenges
The Moonside team has extensive experience and resources in consumer electronics innovation and manufacturing. Since the beginning of our journey, we have shipped thousands of Moonside Lamp Ones around the world (Thank you to our lovely users!). We all have learned a lot, especially over the past year from the global supply chain disruption. The Moonside Neon Lighthouse has just completed the pre-production run successfully which means all major toolings and developments are already well finished. It is safe to say that we are now more confident than ever in bringing this awesome project to life, and we will ship the Moonside Neon Lighthouse to our backers both on time and with ensured quality.
We are sure that a lot of you guys have heard about global chip storage and supply chain issues caused by COVID-19. To avoid this problem early on, we have been stocking all the key components of our products to secure a safe level of inventory. Therefore, our manufacturing timeline is not impacted by those issues.
We have shipped to more than 30 different countries and are very experienced in global shipping. We have been working with reliable shipping carriers such as USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL, 4PX, Canada Post, Australia Post, Hermes, Yodel, and more. You will be able to track the entire shipping process of your package once they are shipped out from our warehouse.
Please note that since the COVID-19 is still an ongoing global pandemic, there could still be unexpected situations such as mandatory lockdowns imposed by the government, etc. While we do not expect to see any major disruptions will likely happen in the near future, such uncontrollable circumstances (if do happen) would have some impacts on the manufacturing and shipping process. But we are prepared to minimize the impact of such possible risk.

[like] ... sweet-smelling welding fumes, burning metal, a distinct odour of ozone, an acrid smell, walnuts and brake pads, gunpowder, fruit, rum, and even burnt almond cookie.""</span></h1><p><span>Decades ago</span>, NASA asked specialists to develop the ""smell of space"" to help train astronauts before launch into orbit. NASA's goal of simulating Space during training is to eliminate any surprises Astronauts might experience in Outer Space. Astronauts experience a high G Force Centrifuge simulator for blastoff training, carryout extreme underwater to trainings in Zero G weightlessness for when they reach outer space, and learn what to expect for everything in between. After all, i<span>t </span><span><span>is</span></span><span>Rocket Science. </span>The history of the ""Smell of Space"" has been clouded behind various accounts of existence. Ever since the first space walk, astronauts were shocked by the lingering odor when returning back into the spacecraft. Some describe it as gun powder, rum, fruit, seared steak, or a BBQ. The first space tourists also noted a pungent aroma once the hatch opened, 'like burnt cookies'. We had to find out for ourselves...<span>What does space smell like?</span> We dug deep. With a bit of luck (and a beautiful thing called a FOIA request), we found our lead. A perfumer based in the UK. ""The smell of space is so distinct that..NASA reached out to [a fragrance maker] to re-create the odor for its training simulations"". <span>Bingo.</span> Two exclusive commercial contracts later, a secret shelved formula based on verified astronaut accounts, a <span>very large</span> minimum order of fragrance...and we're all off smelling space! We've had Space Ice Cream...this just takes it a small step further. <span>(Or maybe it's a leap for all man kind?)</span></p><div data-id=""29834737""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1597686787/h4r4h4roqatv2wi3yugo.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1>

The ""Smell of Space"" ""…a rather pleasant metallic sensation... [like] ... sweet-smelling welding fumes, burning metal, a distinct odour of ozone, an acrid smell, walnuts and brake pads, gunpowder, fruit, rum, and even burnt almond cookie.""Decades ago, NASA asked specialists to develop the ""smell of space"" to help train astronauts before launch into orbit. NASA's goal of simulating Space during training is to eliminate any surprises Astronauts might experience in Outer Space. Astronauts experience a high G Force Centrifuge simulator for blastoff training, carryout extreme underwater to trainings in Zero G weightlessness for when they reach outer space, and learn what to expect for everything in between. After all, it isRocket Science. The history of the ""Smell of Space"" has been clouded behind various accounts of existence. Ever since the first space walk, astronauts were shocked by the lingering odor when returning back into the spacecraft. Some describe it as gun powder, rum, fruit, seared steak, or a BBQ. The first space tourists also noted a pungent aroma once the hatch opened, 'like burnt cookies'. We had to find out for ourselves...What does space smell like? We dug deep. With a bit of luck (and a beautiful thing called a FOIA request), we found our lead. A perfumer based in the UK. ""The smell of space is so distinct that..NASA reached out to [a fragrance maker] to re-create the odor for its training simulations"". Bingo. Two exclusive commercial contracts later, a secret shelved formula based on verified astronaut accounts, a very large minimum order of fragrance...and we're all off smelling space! We've had Space Ice Cream...this just takes it a small step further. (Or maybe it's a leap for all man kind?)
""Will you pledge your support today to help mass manufacturer Eau de Space, so that everyone can experience the 'Smell of Space' for themselves?""  We've partnered with award winning perfumers, some of the best in the world, and secured the rights to launch this product exclusively. Our team consists of top Fashion, Tech, Design, and Logistics experience--all with a desire to increase interest in STEM fields through experiential education. Click ""Register your School"" below to add your STEM program. Eau de Space is our first product launch under this important initiative, and we hope there will be many more. ""Still on the fence? When's the next time you'll get to smell outer space?""We're ready to manufacturer the smell and all we need is meet our MOQ (Minimum order Quantity). Then we can bottle and ship the smell of space directly to you.Buy One, Give OneTom's founder, Blake Mycoskie founded his shoe company on the ""One for One"" model. The One for One model is designed so that for every shoe purchased, one is donated to someone in need. This model, and shoe, was so popular that other large companies like Sketchers were inspired to release shoes in a similar fashion, one of which they named ""Bobs"". 
""For every bottle of Eau de Space you buy, we're going to donate one to a K-12 Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) program in need."" It's a big promise, and isn't the best decision for a company trying to make a profit. But, we really believe in the cause and hope you do too. Imagine if a child that smells Eau de Space today is inspired to become an astronaut, scientist, or engineer. One day, that same child may even become the first human to walk on Mars. That's the kind of impact experiential education has on early teaching programs in the formative years of child development. And it's a really neat mission to be a part of. © Eau de Space 2020.

They've perfected all aspects of linen production, from thread making, dying and weaving, to printing and sewing. This expertise, paired with the warmth and kindness of the Portuguese people, provided the ideal place to bring the CIMINO HOME collection to life. Who doesn't want to sleep dry?We made cotton percale the foundational fabric for all components of the bedding collection. It's fresh to the touch, highly breathable, and provides the highest quality of rest associated with self-care. Our percale is made from 100% long-staple cotton, medium weight, and durable. Noticeably tighter than the standard type of weave used for bed linens, it produces wrinkle-averse, long-lasting bedding.


 

We kept it clean...
The overall construction of the bedding collection is designed to create a clean, contemporary look: sturdy, half-inch French seams wrap the perimeters and there is minimal detailing throughout providing an uninterrupted canvas for the patterns, colors, and textures to shine.

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Colors, Textures, and Patterns can be combined in any number of ways to create your own unique bedroom.
Colorways consist of patterned heather, chambray, and gingham duvet cover designs, sheet sets in chambray, and gingham and pillow cases and shams. Combine and rotate them to easily keep your bedroom inspired and fresh.

You get real-time alerts from the LuluPet App so you know if there’s an irregularity in your pet’s loo time as soon as possible.
No more excessive vet visits and constant worries—LuluPet lets you rest assured your cat is healthy and happy.And no, we’re not talking about your favorite coffee mug that mysteriously shattered. Your furry friend could be in pain and struggling with health problems and you’d never know it—at least not until it’s too late.Cats have a deeply-rooted natural instinct to hide their pain, making it difficult to spot the signs of illnesses like kidney disease, heart disease and urinary tract problems early on. Lulupet gives you more control over your cat’s wellbeing by alerting you of potential issues the moment it detects an irregularity. Early treatment can help prevent a minor health issue from developing into an irreversible condition.Stool and urine analysis has become the most straightforward way of detecting a wide range of feline diseases. Our super smart kitty commode uses artificial intelligence to monitor and analyze your cat’s health through stool image, weight change and excretory behaviors.Our Marketing Director, Marina, wouldn’t be able to get by without LuluPet monitoring her cat’s health. Her munchkin cat suffers from chronic kidney disease and her vet needs to know the cat’s daily water intake and urine amount. Marina has a full-time job and it’s extremely difficult to track her cat’s water intake and urine amount, but with help from the LuluPet App, she can track her cat’s potty behavior and send a report to her vet.Other “smart” cat litter boxes and traditional weight-based sensors have difficulty telling whether a pet has pooped or urinated.LuluPet uses AI image recognition to help identify urinary tract problems and a built-in camera, infrared sensor, and AI chips to analyze different types of feces. It distinguishes feces using the Bristol Stool Scale and combines with medical data from pet hospitals to identify symptoms of cat diseases.Unfortunately LuluPet has a sad story behind it.I’m James, the founder of LuluPet, and I lost my first kitty to preventable illness. His name was Garlic and he was the landlord’s cat at my college apartment. I grew to love him like he was mine, but after 2 years of living together, Garlic had a hematuria (blood in urine) and we learned he had acute kidney failure. I was devastated by the news, but not as devastated as the owners—Garlic’s only hope was a $3,000 surgery. It was a shocking amount, but they proceeded with the operation because Garlic was family.Unfortunately, Garlic didn’t survive the surgery. The first cat I ever loved died so unexpectedly. When I graduated, I adopted another cat that I named Tomato. Eventually, I learned that she too had urinary tract infection problems and hematuria. Once I found out, I was so stressed—all I could think about was losing Garlic so suddenly. I didn’t want to endure another premature goodbye or watch my pet suffer unnecessarily and that’s when I decided enough was enough.I gave up my job in Silicon Valley and founded LuluPet to solve the concerns of cat owners and protect the health of cats with excretory recognition technology.LuluPet cooperates with multiple animal hospitals in Taiwan, USA and Japan to develop an in-depth, cat pathology database with clinical data from more than 6,000 cats.Once you enter the age, breed and basic lifestyle information for your cat, the LuluPet App automatically cross-references your cat’s data with tens of thousands of pieces of pathological data to understand if your cat’s health status is within the normal range. It even compares the daily image of your cat’s feces to the database—talk about an invasion of privacy!Health data varies for different breeds depending on cat age, but our AI Autonomous Learning Mechanism gives a custom data model for each cat so they get a report uniquely tailored to their situation.LuluPet keeps a complete record on your cat’s daily toilet schedule and overall health, giving you an extensive health monitoring system.Aside from being sick, cats can also show abnormalities when facing environmental and dietary changes. LuluPet helps you observe and take care of your pet during times of change, as well.LuluPet gives you the most accurate updates by combining AI feces image recognition with a health data calculation model for cats. Once the app has your cat’s info, it cross-analyzes with our database containing info from thousands of cats around the world. In addition, you can learn about common cat illnesses and their symptoms right in the LuluPet app.When the data is abnormal, you get a push notification so you never miss the crucial moment to take your baby to the vet.In the off chance that there’s an unrecognizable condition, each cat’s excretion behavior is also stored in a video for your own review.When something’s off with your cat, vet visits typically start with questions that owners don’t know answers to, leaving your vet left to run expensive tests until they get answers. That’s not the case with LuluPet owners.LuluPet’s easy-to-use app doesn’t just keep you informed—it helps your veterinarian get answers and better understand your cat’s behavior. The 24-hour stats and cross-references with our Cat Pathology Database give your veterinarian invaluable insight to consider alongside their own findings.LuluPet identifies up to 15 individual cats by memorizing faces, fur colors and different recorded data per cat, like weight. This way, every cat’s toilet schedule is recorded individually, without each cat needing a special collar or attachment for identification. If you have two similar looking kitties, no problem! LuluPet uses their weight difference to determine who’s who—as long as it’s more than 0.11 lbs (50 grams), they can be distinguished! Your cat is sure to reach potty purrvana with one of LuluPet’s conversion options. LuluPet developed parts that are easy to assemble and customize so every cat gets its purrfect setup—whether that’s an open-air litter box, semi-closed or closed!Our litter box has a double-door design including a front entry and top exit.The top exit helps reduce fallen litter when cats finish their business and the front entry is ideal for kittens and senior cats who are unable to jump constantly.Scented, unscented, clumping, not clumping—your kitty has preferences and LuluPet works with them all.Cleaning a litter box has never been easier with our handy, pull-out drawer design! No need to disassemble or practically climb inside, just pull out the drawer and scoop or empty.Cats with “more to love” will enjoy taking care of business in LuluPet. The hexagonal shape creates the most internal space for your cat while keeping it manageable for every size household.When it comes to investing in a tech-enhanced litter box, your options fall under two categories: self-cleaning and health-monitoring litter boxes. Self-cleaning litter boxes cost upwards of $400 and provide convenience in your daily life, but at what cost? That $400+ choice for convenience can quickly turn into thousands in vet bills if your cat has a health issue that goes undetected.LuluPet, on the other hand, puts your cat’s health and your best interests first.

This approach has, in turn, emphasized the cute and friendly aesthetic; allowing it to blend into virtually any home, no matter the decor.Finally, the necessary ventilation and lighting have been hidden behind the flowing fins - allowing the object to truly feel like a piece of homeware.WHICH COLOUR DO YOU LIKE?Given our British heritage, we have four nature-inspired colours. Hedgehog comes in Orange Belly, Woodland Brown, Midnight Blue and Forest Green.(you can choose your colour before shipping)WHAT'S UNDER THE SPIKES?

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Viking Dreki (Dragon) Floats</strong></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<p>New beginnings are finally dawning upon us now that vaccines are being steadily given around the world. And we can only hope for the best that the reset of our reality would bring better fortunes for everyone. But for now, summer is upon us! Even though we’re staying at home, lounging in our frame or inflatable pools, let’s make the best out of the cheerful weather.</p>
<p>How can we make summer more fun; you ask? Huge Inflatable Floats! Viking Lair has been successfully retailing quality inflatable floats and now have decided to design its very own line of Viking-themed Inflatable Pool Floats.</p>
<p>The very first prototypes from this line are their Viking Dreki (Dragon) Boat Float that takes inspiration from the Viking longships used in Scandinavia during the Viking Age throughout the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The floats look fierce and undeniably cute at the same time. Additionally, it is HUGE and can hold up to 2 to 3 people or a bunch of kids. It is constructed with durable non-toxic &amp; environment-friendly PVC, and its material is thicker than most in the market which minimizes the risk of punctures and scratches.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fun new pool float that the whole family can enjoy, this will definitely deliver some good times and earn curious glances for its unique design. You can bring it at the beach, lake, pool parties, and anywhere you want to lounge cozily on a unique and gigantic float.</p>
<p>We have successfully sold hundreds of our Golden Swan Floats and we have heard great feedbacks. With this positive start, we’re looking to expand and produce more. Together, let’s embark on this journey! We want to launch two new floats! The Viking Boat Inflatable Float Inflatable Float! These floats are bigger than our original floats by 20%!</p>
<p>We started our small Alaskan company to have the freedom to run our own business and let our creativity prosper. We chose to launch our product here on Kickstarter hoping to expand what we have commenced. Our hope is to continue developing products that are fun, engaging, and where everyone can participate in. Fueled by your support, may we carry on building beautiful things for all of us.</p>

About making some noise and letting as many people know what we're doing. We absolutely need capital to move forward, BUT I also find great value in spreading the word to the greater building and creative community. So, if monetary participation is not possible, then I also would so appreciate you simply passing on this project to those who might be interested; those in housing theory, those studying/working in the built environment, in art, in architecture, in pertinent community building projects, in sustainable design, in environmental work, in government planning... or even in me!  
   To ease your noise making, please use the sharing tools indiegogo has provided. 
  Here are also some links to follow and pass around, to stay connected day to day.

I represent this story in my kinetic sculpture that uses a single nylon string bound between 2 motors creating beautiful standing waves.  As the string spins endlessly, it is illuminated by stroboscopic LED lights creating beautiful displays of colors and shapes that are both mesmerizing and therapeutic to look at.Lamp in Black color (Volcanic Lightning mode)I take advantage of 3 main scientific principles in this creation: Standing Waves, Persistence-of-Vision, and the Stroboscopic Effect.  As Wikipedia defines it:

Standing Waves are waves which oscillate in time but whose peak amplitude does not move in space

Persistence-of-Vision is the optical illusion that occurs when visual perception of an object does not cease for some time after the rays of light proceeding from it have ceased to enter the eye

The Stroboscopic Effect is a visual phenomenon caused by aliasing that occurs when continuous motion is represented by a series of short or instantaneous samples
Lamp in White color (Tango mode)The LEDs strobe (turn ON and OFF) to illuminate the spinning string at regular intervals.  By capturing periodic points in time of where the string was and wasn't, it creates an illusion of the string taking on many different colors, or splitting into many strings, or dancing erratically, and many more effects.The string rotates 60-90 times per second and the lights strobe at specific intervals to create unique patternsEach lamp has been programmed with 11 different color patterns, each one vividly unique from the others:
“Northern Lights” creates a custom show of colors to evoke a calming presence of dancing auroras in your own home
“Carnival” brings you back to your childhood visits to the circus, a past-time that is slowly going away in this modern age
“Tango” is an illusion of 2 strings dancing back and forth endlessly
“Pride” celebrates diversity and inclusion with colors of the rainbow
“Classic” is a simple demonstration of standing waves illuminated in warm white
“Volcanic Lightning” simulates lightning strikes in the midst of a volcanic color palette
“Chameleon” changes colors in many spots over time to create a mesmerizing gradient
“Mossy Forest"" lets you walk through moist moss with your eyes and not your feet 
“Eclipse” demonstrates the fading in and out of slices of standing waves
“Glacier” makes you feel like you're standing in an ice cavern
 ""Northern Lights"" mode simulates auroras ""Tango"" mode creates 2 strings that dance together endlesslyThe lamp also generates a gentle draft current for circulating air around a small room.  A faint hum (similar to a small fan) surrounds the lamp as the string rotates 60-90 times per second creating a white-noise and ASMR-like ambiance.Table settingTaking into consideration the aesthetics, I’ve designed it such that it fits in a variety of settings that can normally fit a traditional lamp.  At 16x6x6 inches, it's not too big nor too small to be placed in a bookshelf, on a nightstand, on a fireplace mantle, on a work desk, on a side table, as a centrepiece, in a cubby, in a reception area, etc.  The ambient light show illuminates the surroundings in an innovative way that is sure to draw eyes and start conversations in any setting.Headstand setting and random cycling of colors allows for a wide variety of ambient mood settings""Pride"" mode creates a rainbowWith the 2 aluminum dials, users can change color patterns and motor speeds. Users can also gently touch the rotating string disturbing the natural ebb and flow resulting in vastly different forms and shapes. The aluminum dials are available in black, silver, or copper at no extra cost.Black, silver, copper dial choices Feeling is believingThe specifications are as follows (but do note they are subject to change over the lifetime of the campaign and manufacturing, but not by much):

<p>All our products are made of natural raw materials such as coconut, bamboo, palm tree, seaweed, wood, sugar cane, and more, which are coming from different countries in Asia. Each place has its own development skills to produce our products.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Our major raw materials</u></h3>
<h3>1. Coconut tree</h3>
<p>Coconut is 100% plant-based resources, we can create many types of products but still keep the planet safe. Coconut is not just eatable but also a good alternative to wood and helps to prevent deforestation. The coconut flesh can be used for food and milk, the coconut shell can be used for cooking and craft material. Especially the coconut husks can be used for natural scrubbers to clean, making ropes and craft material.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>2. Palm tree</h3>
<p>The palm tree leaves, we can also create such as 100% disposable kitchen products and many more. All these products are chemical-free and can be 100% bio-gradable, compostable, even after 150 days. The palm tree is not only good raw material for product making but also it absorbs indoor air pollutants, easy to maintain, and helps to decrease mental health.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>3. Bamboo tree</h3>
<p>The bamboo, simply almost everything can be made. It is the fastest growing plant on earth and requires little maintenance. We have various products made of bamboo, such as cutlery, water bottle, thermos bottle, and more.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>All our products are eco-friendly, sustainable, and biodegradable, which can also be recycled for many purposes such as planting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All the product packaging is produced with eco-responsible ink, which is made of soy. For those exceptional cases, such as wood products, this will be printed with laser printing.</p>

<h3>Help us to Indiegogo our project</h3>
<p>We want to create a service for our customers to consume our products without any concerns of the process of the production line. Our products are credible and therefore we want to be fully transparent to our customers especially the end-to-end process. We ensure that all our products are safe to use for their personal usage and for the planets as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>To Indiegogo our project, we need your support!</h3>
<p><strong>If we target 100% of this project</strong>, we will be able to create various types of products and focus on product development. We can source new raw materials (seaweed, sugar cane, corn) to create single-use packagings such as individual bag or food wraps. Also, we will be able to make 100% plant-based soap that can be used for all types of skin and animals.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623838218/qtp30bligwqnviemzbax.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If we target 150% of the project</strong>, with collaboration with FIBOO Company, we will be able to focus on research on sustainable and eco-material development. FIBOO Company is based in Lille, France focused on the innovation and development of bamboo. Their major focus is to use bamboo as a raw material for low-energy construction and equipment for transportation. Together with FIBOO, we will build our own bamboo forest in the North of France and be able to focus on research and development. Our target is to plant 1000 bamboo trees, 2 hectares, within a year as it can create its own ecosystem and this will be permanent.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>If we target 200% of the project</strong>, we will be able to create a foundation of “return to nature”, meaning be able to return what we have received from our nature. One of our long-term plan is to build a school for our children who do not have opportunity to learn. A school that is made of panel solar and natural raw materials. A school that runs by nature, not machine. We want every child to have an opportunity to learn the importance of the planet – climate, pollution, food, water, land, and wildlife.</p>

<p>All our products are designed by founder Pak, spending 15 months to source the right raw materials, product design, and quality control. During this process, we tried our best to skip all the unnecessary costs and materials, such a plastic, to deliver the best quality of the products. During the quality control, we have mainly focused on:</p>
<p>Testing the raw material in a different condition, i.e. different temperature, a mix of different raw material to find the perfect match</p>
<p>Testing the inner and outer design of each product, i.e. shape, comfort, grip, ease of use</p>
<p>Safety test, i.e. fork and knives shape, water bottle cap, food-safe.</p>

</div></div>","After 6 campaigns were successfully launched on Indiegogo in the last several years and raised over USD 2,200,000 with 16,000 backers, ROIDMI is back to launch our newest generation of the vacuum cleaner - ROIDMI X20S  – A Cordless Vacuum Cleaner with Smart Self-Cleaning Mop. 

 

 
Check Out What Others Say about ROIDMI X20S
 





 

 
Most of us hate house cleaning and getting our hands dirty. Now, it's time to get yourself the handiest helper - ROIDMI X20S, which will clean your house while keeping your hands clean. 

    

Compare to previous models of vacuum and mop 2-in-1 cleaner，a separate mop head is newly added and it’s no longer just a small accessory that attached to the vacuum head. The three-level drip adjustment makes it easier to tackle various types of stains on the ground.

ROIDMI X20S uses the standard mode to clean the liquid on the floor like milk, sauce, etc, and wet mode for footprint or thicker liquid. If you simply want to dry the floor, just use the dry mode to mop. Easy peasy!


 

with the 240ml water tank, X20S will help you to mop your house totally at one time. With a mop speed of up to 200rpm in one swift motion, it removes all the stains on the floor effectively and efficiently.


Powered by a 138W suction power and 120,000 rpm brushless DC motor, the Roidmi X20S generates strong suction power. It's engineered to capture ingrained dirt and mess from carpets, crevices on the floor, and even mattresses. The digital motor generates up to 25KPa centrifugal air pressure, effectively removes the dust on the ground.  
 


With the unique dual-spin mop head, in addition to deeply dust and scrub floors, it also gathers the debris to the middle and vacuum at the same time. The surface is perfectly clean and absolutely no trace of the stain is left.



 

ROIDMI X20S is equipped with a separate mopping head and a self-cleaning base station. Simply put the mop head on the base station and press the self-cleaning button. The inward rotation of the mop head drives the fan in the base station to rotate in order to inject the water into the mop at the same time, and the scraper on the base station will easily scrape off the dirt on the mop. After scraping, reverse the mop head outwards to remove water from the mop. The entire cleaning process is simple, safe, and noise-free.

It only takes about 25 seconds to complete the cleaning and dry the mop automatically. Just like brand new.

<p><strong>The story of Karaberd</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are five friends who met each other when volunteering with Birthright Armenia. Common interests, strong friendship, and a shared passion for positive change brought us even closer. The five of us found a house in the village of Karaberd located in Lori Province—not to confuse it with the one in Shirak. Only a two-hour drive from Yerevan, the dwelling was nestled in a verdant land boasting striking views of the nearby grand mountains. We decided to buy it and make it a livable space.</p>
<p>The quaint home has a lovely garden. Fruit saplings and old-growth walnut trees enrich the greenery—the garden itself is a fantastic camping spot. Coming here is quite the experience; you embark on a journey to be completely isolated from the hustle and bustle. Here, you are one with nature. </p>
<p>In order to fulfill our dreams and make this house a rural paradise, the house is in dire need of serious construction which costs a lot of money. Between the five of us, we still require proper funding to transform this house into a homey residence. Now, you might think, why would we want to donate money to five people to build a house? The answer is—it’s also going to be yours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Become an occupant now</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goal of this project is not only for people to own a village house; it’s to encourage them to come and spend time in towns and villages that rather go unnoticed. We want to build a community of people who take joy in being in the great outdoors, in the heart of nature—we all get to have a place to stay in that’s not Yerevan, Dilijan, or Tsakhkadzor.  </p>
<p>This project is aimed at revitalizing ghost towns and villages in Armenia, starting with Karaberd. We're collecting funds to renovate a two-story building in the village. Whoever donates <strong>$250 </strong>(or more) becomes an occupant of the house. Being an occupant means you get to stay at the house whenever you want, as long as you want, for as many times as you want. </p>
<p>Imagine having to pay only <strong>$250</strong> to “own” a house to stay in whenever you’d like. Instead of spending it on new things, why not invest it in becoming an occupant and a part of the movement to build a community?    </p>
<p>Another question arises: if hundreds of people donate, how will they all fit into this house? No, it’s not impossible. There’ll be a calendar for people to mark the days they want to spend in the house. You’ll have to specify when, for how long, how many people, and every other required detail. To host a reasonable amount of occupants simultaneously, five safari tent-style bedrooms will surround the building. This way, you have more privacy and take advantage of all the space around you. </p>
<p>We did the math and came to understand that $50,000 is the amount we need to transform this house into a blissful home. Upon reaching our target, the construction will begin immediately and completed in the span of five months. All you have to do is become a part of the initiative. </p>
<p>The minimum amount to donate in order to become an occupant is <strong>$250</strong>. When donating on behalf of multiple people, please include their names. For example, if you're a family of four, you'll be donating $1,000 and mentioning the names of all four family members. However, anything less than <strong>$250 </strong>will be regarded as an act of kindness to help boost the project. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Future homes in other towns</strong></p>
<p>Once we’ve completed the first house, we plan to scout for other villages to implement the same project there. By building new residences in overlooked villages and disregarded ghost towns, we’ll not only motivate others to join us, but we’ll also bring these areas back to life. The more times you donate, the more houses you’ll have at your disposal all over Armenia. And with more houses in different locations, there’ll be more flexibility and availability in the future. </p>
<p>Thanks to this project, not only will we be shedding more light on these overlooked areas, but we're also encouraging people to go there and restore their former glory.  We're building a community and putting these ghost towns in Armenia back on the map. We're making people look past Yerevan, Dilijan, and Tsakhkadzor, and showing them that there's more to Armenia.</p>
<p>In the long run, you're saving tons of money by investing only $250 for a village home.  In the process, you're building a community along with the other occupants and putting these Armenian villages back on the map—all while enjoying a peaceful retreat in your new home. </p>
<p>These houses make the perfect place to create happy memories with your family, embark on adventures with your friends, and spend quality time with your special someone. Whether you wish to host your birthday weekend, take a break from the bustling city, or even start a summer camp for kids, your journey starts at Karaberd.</p>

<h3><strong>Pan2Can</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most precious gifts we can give ourselves is more time. A few extra minutes a day can add up to a whole extra hour each week for you to use in your most favorite way possible. Cleaning is time-consuming. It’s often the mundane necessity to our daily routine at home (alongside cooking, washing, folding, dusting…you get the idea!)</p>

<h3><strong>Crafted with Care</strong></h3>
<p>HI! I’m Deirdree, the owner of DeirdreeDsign, Inc. I am a seasoned graphic designer turned product designer, and now, the proud owner and inventor of the Pan2Can (patent and trademarked).</p>
<p>One of the things I most love about the Pan2Can, is that it can be a valuable aid for the elderly and those with disabilities; those who find it difficult to squat or stoop down while sweeping inside or outside of the house. I’ve designed the Pan2Can with this in mind - It is easy to maneuver by adjusting it with a broom while sweeping, and very little bending is required.</p>
<p>As a Caregiver to my wonderful father for 16 years, I explored ways we could better provide support within the home. It motivated me to help other caregivers and those that may need that extra help, The concept of Pan2Can derived from this, and my Father and our beloved cocker spaniel, Destin (Dezi) were key contributors to the development and design, specifically in testing where we developed and discover the many different uses of my product. As a proud daughter, dog owner, designer, and owner of Pan2Can, I am committed to developing and bringing Pan2Can to market, using trusted, proven, and durable materials, so every Pan2Can product will guarantee quality and longevity.</p>

<h3><strong>Your Help to Launch Pan2Can</strong></h3>
<p>I am looking for backers to help me fund the manufacturing and distribution of the Pan2Can. Our plan is to raise at least $111,000 towards the plastic injection molding for its first production run and distribution of the Pan2Can.</p>
<p>For almost 20 years, I have developed this concept, tested it throughout our home to perfect its uses – it’s been a true labor of love. I have now been working diligently for the past 24 months; from tweaking the design drawings and function, to producing prototypes, to completing the patent and trademark process.</p>
<p>Now we’re ready to get this important project funded - After 20 years, I am hoping that we can finally make this happen.</p>
<p>The impact the Pan2Can can make to those in need, as well as caregivers is so important - I will be giving a percentage of revenue to caregiving organizations, such as AARP Caregiver’s Support and their affiliates</p>
<p>Please consider funding this project with me, it can truly make an impact on people’s day-to-day lives.</p>

<div><h3><strong>Finally - Easy to Use Solution for Year Round Climate Control Down to Specific Rooms</strong></h3></div>
<div><div>
<p>We’ve all experienced first hand that drafty room, the too hot bedroom in the summer months, and the other summer and winter temperature imbalances that come when the air in your home isn’t smoothly flowing.</p>
<p>90% of homeowners in North America have exactly the same problem, their furnace (heating and cooling system) can't manage or direct airflow to the rooms that need it most. Therefore they end up being too cold or too hot, never just right.</p>
<p>This problem has been around as long as heating and cooling home systems have been - until now.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong><span>Room Comfort</span></strong></h3>
<p>In most 2-story houses in North America, there are one or two rooms that doesn't follow the thermostat settings and no matter what you do they're always either too hot in the summer or freezing in the winter and no matter how you adjust the thermostat and close off vents it doesn’t seem to help.</p>

<h3><span>Always Adjusting Thermostat</span></h3>
<p>Constantly adjusting your thermostat at home to keep everyone comfortable, affects your energy consumption, monthly bills, and HVAC  equipment, not to mention the continuous disagreements between the members of your home.</p>
<p>By changing the temperature your heat pump and furnace must work harder to adjust to the fluctuating changes. As a result, your energy bill goes up and it causes extra wear and tear and maintenance bills because the equipment is working so hard.</p>

<p>SmartCocoon Smart Register Booster Fan is installed under the vent grill, and is best used in the rooms that need air flow improvement and works towards your comfort all year round. Once it's set up, it automatically connects to your existing smart and even non-smart thermostats, syncs itself with your heating and cooling system using its proprietary AI algorithm.</p> <p>Then it draws the trapped air in the ducting system based on the user requirements and environmental properties - and it does that in a very smart way. Using multiple ranges of sensors it detects when the room is falling behind the set thermostat temperature. Based on its four different operating modes it then turns on to blow (warm or cool) air to balance the airflow to a comfort level of your liking.</p> <p>Unlike the other solutions out there, SmartCocoon smart booster fans can actually control the airflow imbalance instead of just monitoring it. They act like the arms and legs of your thermostat and heating and cooling system (HAVC) to make sure everyone enjoys their desired comfort in their rooms.</p> <h2><strong><span>Do-It-Yourself</span> <span>Installation</span> </strong></h2>
<p>Our booster fans come with special slide out springs that can be easily and safely installed and once plugged in, it will only take 2-3 minutes to set up using the mobile app and...You're all set to enjoy the comfort experience.</p> <p>To install your device first remove your existing vent grill. Wipe or vacuum inside the vent before installation. Slide out the brackets and place your smart register booster fan inside the vent.</p>

<h2><strong>Energy Saving</strong></h2>
<p>SmartCocoon uses an A.I. algorithm that controls the unit. Our algorithm allows the device to actively and intelligently boost and control the airflow in sync with the main heating and cooling (HVAC) system and creates desired comfort for each room.</p>
<ul>
<li>A 2-fan system saves 30% on HVAC consumption, on average</li>
<li>One fan can increase the overall efficiency of the ducting system by 11%<br/> </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong><span>Available on Android and iOS</span></strong></h2>
<p>SmartCocoon can be controlled by your iPhone or Android device, ensuring you can customize your home comfort based on your unique needs. Our simple-to-use app allows you to control several units at the same time.</p> <p>Using the SmartCocoon app, you can easily set your desired temperature for any room (area) in your house and set the mode to auto, eco, on or off:</p>
<p><br/><span>ON/OFF:</span> keeps the fan always on/off no matter if the main (heating and cooling) system is working or not.</p>
<p><br/><span>eco:</span> turns the fan ""ON"" only when the main HVAC system is working, making it the most energy efficient mode.</p>
<p><br/><span>Auto:</span> defines setpoints for each individual room. In this mode, the fan works only if the main (heating and cooling) system is working and also if the room temperature is not meeting the temperature you set.</p>

<p>""I have been using the SmartCocoon Smart Booster Fan for a few weeks now, and I have to say I’m impressed with how well it works. My home office is a 250 square-foot addition on the back of the house. There are patio doors which open into the yard, and we use these doors year-round to let the dog out. As a result, the office is noticeably cooler in the winter than the rest of the house. It was very easy to install -- I just put the legs on, dropped it into the 4x10 register beside the patio doors, and plugged it in. You put your vent grill back over it and you don't even see the fan. Within about two days the temperature in my office felt the same as the rest of the main floor. A digital thermometer shows that the air temperature now remains within 0.5 degree of the thermostat setting in the living room. Just for fun, I tested it by opening the patio doors on a cold day until the office was three degrees lower than the living room. Within a day the temperature had stabilised again. The fan turns itself on and off periodically. Sometimes I hear it start up, but most of the time the fan noise is hardly noticeable. I would recommend this smart booster fan to people looking for a solution to a room that's too cool in the winter. Easy to install, worked great for me, and unlike floor fans, doesn't take up any space."" <span>-Greg-from-Ottawa, February2020</span></p>

<p>""For such a long time, a noticeable temperature difference between our dinette and the rest of the house bothered my family. I installed the device in the register out of the box, and that is simply gone. My dinette is phenomenally warmer although temperatures have gone substantially down in the past weeks.The pros of this device are its powerful blow (CFM I guess) despite the low profile, the smartness which makes it work just out of the box, and the low noise.

We’ve all experienced first hand that drafty room, the too hot bedroom in the summer months, and the other summer and winter temperature imbalances that come when the air in your home isn’t smoothly flowing.
90% of homeowners in North America have exactly the same problem, their furnace (heating and cooling system) can't manage or direct airflow to the rooms that need it most. Therefore they end up being too cold or too hot, never just right.
This problem has been around as long as heating and cooling home systems have been - until now.
 

 
Our goal is to have you come home from a day of stress to unwind, play, and relax. If you're looking for the ultimate in home comfort, SmartCocoon can help. Our smart climate system gives you complete control over your home's airflow, so the temperature in every room is always just right.
By installing a  SmartCocoon device in the problem area, you gain complete control of  your home’s airflow.  SmartCocoon’s Smart Register Booster Fan can be easily installed into your existing vent, syncs up to your conventional or smart thermostat and is easily controlled using a mobile app.
SmartCocoon was designed to address all the pain points of current uneven airflow that cause discomfort in different rooms of the house. Features
  Use Cases 

Room Comfort
In most 2-story houses in North America, there are one or two rooms that doesn't follow the thermostat settings and no matter what you do they're always either too hot in the summer or freezing in the winter and no matter how you adjust the thermostat and close off vents it doesn’t seem to help.
 

Always Adjusting Thermostat
Constantly adjusting your thermostat at home to keep everyone comfortable, affects your energy consumption, monthly bills, and HVAC  equipment, not to mention the continuous disagreements between the members of your home.
By changing the temperature your heat pump and furnace must work harder to adjust to the fluctuating changes. As a result, your energy bill goes up and it causes extra wear and tear and maintenance bills because the equipment is working so hard.
 

 
Keeping your kids and pets comfortable
It's hard to always make sure your kids and pets are staying comfy - not too cold and not too hot; making them comfortable is essential for a good night sleep and your peace of mind. 
How SmartCocoon Works 

 
SmartCocoon Smart Register Booster Fan is installed under the vent grill, and is best used in the rooms that need air flow improvement and works towards your comfort all year round. Once it's set up, it automatically connects to your existing smart and even non-smart thermostats, syncs itself with your heating and cooling system using its proprietary AI algorithm. Then it draws the trapped air in the ducting system based on the user requirements and environmental properties - and it does that in a very smart way. Using multiple ranges of sensors it detects when the room is falling behind the set thermostat temperature. Based on its four different operating modes it then turns on to blow (warm or cool) air to balance the airflow to a comfort level of your liking. Unlike the other solutions out there, SmartCocoon smart booster fans can actually control the airflow imbalance instead of just monitoring it. They act like the arms and legs of your thermostat and heating and cooling system (HAVC) to make sure everyone enjoys their desired comfort in their rooms. Do-It-Yourself Installation 
Our booster fans come with special slide out springs that can be easily and safely installed and once plugged in, it will only take 2-3 minutes to set up using the mobile app and...You're all set to enjoy the comfort experience. To install your device first remove your existing vent grill. Wipe or vacuum inside the vent before installation. Slide out the brackets and place your smart register booster fan inside the vent.
*In the majority of US and Canadian residential buildings, there are usually accessible plugs within a couple of feets to where vents are usually located.
The next step is to install and setup the mobile app.

 
Energy Saving
SmartCocoon uses an A.I. algorithm that controls the unit. Our algorithm allows the device to actively and intelligently boost and control the airflow in sync with the main heating and cooling (HVAC) system and creates desired comfort for each room.

A 2-fan system saves 30% on HVAC consumption, on average
One fan can increase the overall efficiency of the ducting system by 11% 


Compatibility
Whether or not you have a smart thermostat, you can use SmartCocoon. The device automatically connects to your existing smart or traditional thermostat, syncs itself with your heating and cooling system using its proprietary AI algorithm.

Available on Android and iOS
SmartCocoon can be controlled by your iPhone or Android device, ensuring you can customize your home comfort based on your unique needs. Our simple-to-use app allows you to control several units at the same time. Using the SmartCocoon app, you can easily set your desired temperature for any room (area) in your house and set the mode to auto, eco, on or off:
ON/OFF: keeps the fan always on/off no matter if the main (heating and cooling) system is working or not.
eco: turns the fan ""ON"" only when the main HVAC system is working, making it the most energy efficient mode.
Auto: defines setpoints for each individual room. In this mode, the fan works only if the main (heating and cooling) system is working and also if the room temperature is not meeting the temperature you set.

""The unit works well with my smart stat, I have a room that is not getting enough air flow installed the unit added the app and synced it up with my thermostat. Noticed a good increase in airflow to the room."" -Dinos, August 2020

""The fan was easy to install and the app set-up was simple. Best of all the fan is very quiet and is barely noticeable above the normal AC vent sound. I am very happy with this purchase."" -Thelout, July2020

""We have two rooms that are either too hot or too cold even in spite of a brand new top-of-the-line AC and furnace. We installed two SmartCocoons in the first room and we are very impressed with how it's working so far. It seems to help draw more cold air through the vents into the room. It is nice that it goes into the vent and you really can't see it except for the cord. We are going to buy a few more for the other rooms. We had one question during installation and we left a message and they called us right back. Thank you for a great solution during such a hot summer."" -Nicole, july2020

""Fantastic product, and has made a world of difference in our home."" -DavidJohn, September2020

""It works well. Working continuously can change the temperature of a room depends the size from 1-3 degree F."" -CarmeloKohler, July2020

 ""Easy to install"" Fernando M, August2020

""I have been using the SmartCocoon Smart Booster Fan for a few weeks now, and I have to say I’m impressed with how well it works. My home office is a 250 square-foot addition on the back of the house. There are patio doors which open into the yard, and we use these doors year-round to let the dog out. As a result, the office is noticeably cooler in the winter than the rest of the house. It was very easy to install -- I just put the legs on, dropped it into the 4x10 register beside the patio doors, and plugged it in. You put your vent grill back over it and you don't even see the fan. Within about two days the temperature in my office felt the same as the rest of the main floor. A digital thermometer shows that the air temperature now remains within 0.5 degree of the thermostat setting in the living room. Just for fun, I tested it by opening the patio doors on a cold day until the office was three degrees lower than the living room. Within a day the temperature had stabilised again. The fan turns itself on and off periodically. Sometimes I hear it start up, but most of the time the fan noise is hardly noticeable. I would recommend this smart booster fan to people looking for a solution to a room that's too cool in the winter. Easy to install, worked great for me, and unlike floor fans, doesn't take up any space."" -Greg-from-Ottawa, February2020

""Very efficient , we had problem fixing the room temperature but it never worked until I found this unit , now temperature is ok in all rooms."" -Roozbeh P, Jan2020

""For such a long time, a noticeable temperature difference between our dinette and the rest of the house bothered my family. I installed the device in the register out of the box, and that is simply gone. My dinette is phenomenally warmer although temperatures have gone substantially down in the past weeks.The pros of this device are its powerful blow (CFM I guess) despite the low profile, the smartness which makes it work just out of the box, and the low noise. The app is simple enough to understand, however could improve aesthetically.Graceful installation in less than 5 minutes with the complete user manual."" -Manoj, November2020

 Efficient, quiet and easy to install. Something finally works, Highly recommended! -Babak A, November2019

The difference this made in my house is mind blowing! For  years and years we had trouble with inconsistent temperature throughout  my house, one room always colder and one always hotter than needed. Within a couple of hours of installing this, I could see the effect!           Now all the rooms have perfectly synced temperatures. Also saved up on the bill, saving electricity.
