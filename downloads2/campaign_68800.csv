<p><i>Magdala is the executive director and founder of Sacred Woman. Sacred Woman values honor, holism, multiculturalism, community, sisterhood,  and the wisdom of the ages.  Their programs and ceremonies provide the space, resources and facilitation for people to grow in themselves and to learn in ways that embrace and consummate the traditions of many cultures and the wisdom of the ages. Magdala Ramirez Garcia is a spiritual leader and healer from the Maya Mexika lineage.  She was born as medicine woman,  from a long linage of medicine people,   in Mexico where she began walking her path at an early age working with the medicine people and the pyramids of Mexico.  She brings the ancient knowledge to the world through original seminars, books, ceremonies, and journeys.</i></p>

Danica Anderson and Magdala Ramirez, the Leaders of Kolo and Sacred Woman, developed the vision for bringing together women from around the world to share their oral traditions and weave their wisdom.

Magdala is the executive director and founder of Sacred Woman. Sacred Woman values honor, holism, multiculturalism, community, sisterhood,  and the wisdom of the ages.  Their programs and ceremonies provide the space, resources and facilitation for people to grow in themselves and to learn in ways that embrace and consummate the traditions of many cultures and the wisdom of the ages. Magdala Ramirez Garcia is a spiritual leader and healer from the Maya Mexika lineage.  She was born as medicine woman,  from a long linage of medicine people,   in Mexico where she began walking her path at an early age working with the medicine people and the pyramids of Mexico.  She brings the ancient knowledge to the world through original seminars, books, ceremonies, and journeys.

Dr. Anderson is the executive director of Kolo: Women’s Cross Cultural Collaboration which she founded in 2000 to bear witness to women and families in places and spaces where humanity ends. Her interests remain consistent in exploring trauma’s impact as not a death sentence but an enrollment into intensive learning and growth.  As Danica points out, the essence is summed up in the concise collaborative social Justice and self-sustainability found in healing our own local communities and ourselves.  It’s about ennobling and empowering those who have suffered catastrophic violence and crisis.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

and well-being of people in developing countries through partnership
 efforts with various organizations and volunteers from multiple disciplines. This year, volunteers from HVI have identified pressing needs in a community in Tumsar, Maharashtra India. Among several others, we will be serving with members of this community in the areas of providing basic healthcare, supporting the citizens in their efforts toward sustainable food and clothing supply; providing emotional and spiritual support and educating the people on how to maximize available community resources. We hope that this will be the first of many years of long-term<br/>partnership with members of this community.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We're raising $35,000 toward this interdisciplinary Mission Trip to India.<br/>We ask you to donate any amount you can for this cause. We also need medications, clothes, food items and abundance of toys for this community.<br/>For a donation of $50 or more, you will receive a certificate of Global Impact Partnership from Healing Vessels International. You will also be invited to our Global Impact Partners' Appreciation Event that will be hosted this year. Trae McMaken, musician, folklorist and traditional bearer has donated 25 of his Long Winter Nights CDs to anyone who chooses to have a copy for a donation of $25 or more.  Thank you so much for your assistance toward this project. <br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your partnership will go a long way to effect significant changes:</p>
<p>Healing Vessels will be able to initiate a long-term collaborative relationship with the people of Tumsar; we will be able to impact their healthcare needs and help families acquire skills that they could use to sustain their loved ones.</p>
<p>Your gift will help support our diverse team of healthcare professionals and students as they learn to serve in a different culture, grow personally and professionally, and make lasting impact in Tumsar.</p>
<p>This first mission trip will especially benefit children as we plan to assist with the completion of a building where kids will be taught and taken care of. Additionally, by helping to serve the healthcare needs of entire families, your contribution will help to bridge the gap in the health status of this community.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Traveling is a major risk these days. However, with proper safety measures put in place, most of the dangers associated with traveling abroad can be minimized. Furthermore, with every mission trip, there is the challenge of being able to mobilize community-based support to sustain the activities initiated. We will work hard to form a strong network of support from local citizens, community leaders and organizations to make sure that we share in their vision for the community and situate ourselves as collaborators for the well-being of Tumsar. <br/>

<p>We are here to create a positive, powerful
change in the businesses and lives of Young Lions, ambitious entrepreneurial men between the
ages of 30 and 49.</p>
<p>We coach men on how to build
immensely profitable businesses. We show them how to create hugely favorable
exits that will allow them, one day, to sell these businesses and set a
foundation for their family’s wealth. But that is only half the story. </p>
<p>No man has ever been happy with a
pocket full of cash and a life devoid of love, relationships, health, purpose, and more. The entrepreneurial journey can put
huge demands on the lives of every entrepreneur - long hours, working weekends, constant
travel, lonely family, and high-stress levels, to name but a few. And unless these demands are
checked and juggled without dropping a ball, they can wreak havoc on our personal lives: broken marriages,
estranged kids, difficult relationships, poor health. Hardly the picture of a
successful man living an extraordinary life. </p><p>But your business doesn’t have to suck your life away. We want to show good, talented, hard-working men—men who are exactly where we used to be in life—how to build a truly well-rounded life that fluidly adapts to its ebbs and flows. Our curriculum, two-on-one individual coaching, and life-changing retreats have been specifically designed to help busy entrepreneurs achieve the harmonious life-work balance they've always wanted.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1226559/files/20150216140759-Brand_guide_cover.jpg?1424124479"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>To The Lion</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re a Young Lion at heart, you’ve already got the raw talent, burning
ambition, and practical brilliance it takes to succeed. What you now need are a
couple of experienced guides to help direct your drive, and a strong group of
like-minded men to support you along the journey.</p><p>Welcome to the pride. We’re
excited you've joined us.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1208410/files/20150209061759-Lioness-3485x2323.jpg?1423491479"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>To The Lioness</h3>And if you’re a Lioness reading this, filled with that powerful female drive that supports Young Lions and nurtures their cubs, standing with them shoulder to shoulder in
the family pride while following her own path to leadership and success, know
that we value you immensely. Since our programs take a full-on, professional-and-personal approach to teaching, coaching, and mentoring that covers all
aspects of a man’s life, we don’t claim to be the best mentors for your
development in your own complex role as a professional woman, wife, and mother.<div>
<br/><div>But if you share our ideals and would love to give the Young Lions in your life a
true chance at success, then do send us your men and back up their
entrepreneurial journey by supporting our campaign. We’d love to have you in
our extended pride.

<h3>The Problem We Face</h3>
<p>We’re
currently teaching local courses and holding face-to-face coaching sessions for
men in our area. And the response has been tremendous: our students love the
coaching we offer and keep telling us we need to bring our teaching to their
friends, too. But there are only so many hours in a day and only so many miles
two men can journey. Time constraints and geographical restrictions,
unfortunately, keep us from reaching many of the men who’ve reached out to us
and asked us to help them change their lives. </p>
<p>And
this is where YOU come in! We need you to help us make this change happen. </p>

<h3>Changing
the Way We Help Men Reach Their Goals</h3>
<p>After
expert consultation and plenty of experimentation, we have determined that the
most effective way to reach men around the globe and educate them about
building a successful life and business is through video classes. Unlike
reading a book, which can be a taxing and isolating after a day’s hard work, a
video class can not only be a lot more fun, it can also be much more engaging
and interactive—offering question&amp;comment sections waiting for instructor feedback—and much
easier to understand and follow.</p>
<p>For this reason, we have decided to bring our
teaching online and reach ambitious men wherever they happen to be. We’ve taken
our best material, tested and fine-tuned through the coaching and classes we offer to our
local students, and have designed engaging video classes for Young Lions all
around the world.</p>
<p>And these classes aren’t just for men either: anyone can
enjoy our educational videos, and learn from their rich content, whether man or
woman, young or old, entrepreneurial or not—there’s really something for
everyone.</p>
<p>This phase of our project will create the first <i>five of our fifteen </i>free video training classes. 
</p>

<p></p>
<h3><b></b></h3>
<h3>How We’ll
Use the Funds</h3>
<p>100% of the campaign funds will go directly to the production of high-quality video classes. Our video partner is Remedy Films in Atlanta, Georgia. All of us are ready to start shooting as soon as the campaign ends and we meet our funding goal.</p>
<p>All
videos we shoot will be FREE for everyone to watch at the online Resource Library
of Rusty Lion Academy. </p>
<h3><b>The First Five FREE Video Classes </b></h3>
<p>Here are the first five classes that are all set for production:<br/></p>
<p>1. 
Setting
Your Goals: See it, Believe It, and You Can Achieve It</p>
<p>2. 
Your
Lighthouse Values: What Guides the Course of Your Life?</p>
<p>3. 
Conquer
the Beast: Eliminate What Holds You Back</p>
<p>4. 
What Setting Your 25-Year ""Extraordinary Life"" Intentions Can Do For You</p>
<p>5. 
Warrior
Mornings: How to Start the Perfect Day (a student favorite!)</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know our online video classes will be as effective as coaching a student face-to-face or teaching onstage at one of our retreats. </p>
<p></p>

<div>
<p>Oh, that's easy.</p>
<p>First, we'll smile and feel very humbled, grateful, and privileged that all of you believed in us, our passion, and this project.</p>
<p>Then, <i>we'll keep shooting more</i> of our FREE video series!!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We’ve got <i>a total of
fifteen videos</i> in our free class portfolio. This campaign’s goal is to raise
enough money for the first five classes. If we received more than we’ve
planned, we’re fully prepared to shoot more videos right away.</p>
<p>We'd love to have an ""overfund"" issue to deal with! Thank you :-)<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Stretch Goal 1</b></h3>
<p>Here is Phase 2, <i>the next ten free video courses,</i> we will produce in 2015 if we overfund this campaign:</p>
<p>We estimate that phase 2, which comprises the next ten free videos of the series, will cost us around $36,500. As you can see, we expect to save some costs once we find our rhythm and build our methods with the first five videos.</p>
<p>Here are the next ten
titles of the series: </p>
<p>1. 
From Chaos
to Order: Covey’s Four Quadrants of Priority</p>
<p>2. 
Effective
Feedback &amp; Discipline for Leaders</p>
<p>3. 
Smart
Delegation for Quick Results and More Free Time (yours!<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">)</span></p>
<p>4. 
Unexpected
Energy Drainers: How to Identify and Avoid Them</p>
<p>5. 
Fear Vs.
Faith: Change Can’t-Do Into Can-Do</p>
<p>6. 
Life Hacks: Your Life, In Order, In Minutes (a student favorite!)</p>
<p>7. 
How to
Listen Like a Leader (and man, and father, and husband, and son, and             brother…)</p>
<p>8. 
Achieving
Emotional Control: Because Roller-Coasters Are Only Fun at Fun-                 Parks</p>
<p>9. 
Motivating
Employees In A Way That You And They Love</p>
<p>10.  Stress CAN Kill You. Seriously.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Stretch Goal 2</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>There is a phase 3 percolating in our minds. It comprises
another eleven video classes, for a grand total of 26, and we’re estimating it’ll
cost around $40,000. At the moment, we’ve got these classes all neatly planned
in our minds (well, a napkin, actually—bar-stool inspiration and all that…),
but can’t quite share the titles yet. What we can say is that as soon as
production of phases 1 and 2 is underway, we will polish these last classes off
and add them to the plan for late 2015 and early 2016. We’ll keep you updated
via email, of course!</p>

<h3><b>Meet The Academy, The Founders, and The Coaches</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Rusty
Lion Academy has been built upon our shared vision for a “space” (physical,
virtual, and emotional) where men can grow and excel both professionally and
personally. When the two of us met in the late 90s, we bonded over similar
interests and values in a friendship that went far deeper than just the casual
phone-call. We've stuck together supporting each other through the thinnest
and thickest of times. </p>
<p>As a team
we share an intense drive to accomplish our goals and a desire to explore life outside
our comfort zones. But beyond our commonalities, we also have our differences:
the distinct talents and strengths of one that complement and augment those of
the other, so much so that we like to say that in our case, 1+1=3.</p>
<p>In 2013, we joined our life visions officially with the creation of Rusty Lion Academy.
We funded the projected entirely out of our life savings, and sought advice
from some of the world’s most formidable experts such as Brendon Burchard (and
his Experts Academy, where the picture above was taken), and have been coached
by such powerhouse names as John Lee Dumas, Dan Miller, Steve Graves, and James
Roche, just to name a few.</p>
<p>From the
very beginning of this joint adventure, we’ve stuck to our blood oath:
“World-class not half-ass.” That commitment to excellence has made our
journey long and arduous, but above all, worth every second of our time put
into delivering our absolute best to our students!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bottom-line, it's easy to understand what we do. There are hunting guides, mountain guides, fishing guides, museum guides, and tour guides. We're the ""<i>Extraordinary Life</i>"" guides. </p>

<p><i>Uncompromising, formidable
excellence</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Robert
Mallon is a nationally recognized, professional speaker, business coach,
mentor, and meeting facilitator. His students also like to call him an
“Extraordinary Life Guide.” Over the last 35 years, he’s worked for several
nationally known corporations as a leader and manager. In 2002, he became an
entrepreneur and was soon experienced in starting and running many of his own
businesses. His great passion in life is helping men and their companies
grow to their full potential, a mission he’s now fulfilling through the Rusty
Lion Academy. Robert is happily married to Sandy, who’s been a constant help
and support throughout his entrepreneurial journey, not once calling him or his
ideas crazy. The two of them live in Gainesville, Georgia. Together they
have five spectacular children and a most cherished and precious granddaughter.</p>

<h3><b>Bill Watkins</b></h3>
<p><i>Understated, commanding authority</i></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Bill
Watkins spent the first half of his life jumping from achievement to
achievement to achievement. A West Point graduate, he first served as an Army
Engineer Officer, while also competing as a world-class cycling athlete, and
later became a Fortune 500 corporate executive. Always the
entrepreneur at heart, however, Bill left that world to start The Marena Group,
which went from shipping from his garage to employing hundreds and exporting to over 80 countries.
When he sold this business in 2012, Bill had achieved life freedom. But, he
wasn’t quite done yet. In this second part of his life, Bill means to give back
everything he’s learnt through his struggles and experiences, and nothing
thrills him quite like seeing the change in the lives of his students. He wants
the next generation of men to master what he knows and has enjoyed: wealth,
significance, and an extraordinary life. Bill is happily married to Donna, who
cheer him on and encourages his dreams. The two of them live in Jackson,
Wyoming, where every day is filled with joy as they experience the beauty and
adventure of the area. They enjoy three grown children—two from Bill’s first
marriage and a very special son-in-law.</p>

</h3>
<p>It may not seem like it but we're not really ones to talk much about ourselves. We do want you to have confidence we're authentic, ""the real deal."" You can see what others have said about us by scrolling down below.</p>
<p><i>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Before working with Bill and Robert, the goals I was driving toward in my life were fueled by the vapors of long term business success without the foundation of day to day happiness. Mindful of the imbalance between my personal and business life, I spent years reading various books, articles, and blogs.  But no matter what I tried, I would slip back into old routines of working harder building my business at the sacrifice of building my relationships and my personal well being.  When I considered working with a coach, I was skeptical that one could provide any structure or insight that I could not achieve on my own through study and practice. When I started working with Bill and Robert, my old notions of what it would be like to work with a coach was thrown out the window. Bill and Robert have such an incredible ability to help men like me achieve monumental life change.  Their work with me as guides has been nothing short of transformational. Now, my life has a whole new rhythm to it. Bill and Robert have earned my respect, trust, friendship, and sincere gratitude.</i><br/></p>
<p>Scott Fitzgerald, Owner, Fitzgerald Bicycles </p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<i>I met Robert at the right time in my life.  Although things were going well, I had this itching that I was coasting and not employing my full potential.  Robert was like a skilled physician during our first meeting.  He listened, questioned, and examined where I was in life and was quickly able to make an assessment. From that day on Robert put me on a growth plan that keeps accelerating. He started me with small steps until I could begin running on my own.  Now that I am running, Robert is helping to guide the direction that my energy is taking me.  I had studied many of the principles that Robert introduced to me but until you have someone to teach them to you properly, you will never be able to get the most out of them.</i>
</div>
<div>
<p>Mike Holman, Plant Manager, Baldor Electric</p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p><i>Bill Watkins is one of the most inspirational figures of my life. He has always challenged me to imagine and pursue a career that is both fulfilling and meaningful, while not compromising family life in the process. It’s not just a dream! He had creditability with me from the start because I saw him doing it. In many ways I feel like I got a secret MBA during my time with Bill. The education I received from Bill was far more valuable than any paper degree from an institution. An institution doesn’t challenge you to follow your dreams, pursue your passions and live an uncompromising life the way Bill does. Bill is a great listener and teacher who has the uncanny ability to walk you through your thoughts to enlighten your own path ahead. He helps you see the potential you have to live a life of accomplishment and happiness for both yourself and the people you care about.</i></p>
<p>John Rogelstad, Senior Business Consultant, Quintiq</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><i>I have been working with Robert Mallon for over a year now and it has been one of the best decisions of my life. Robert has helped revolutionize my thinking in all areas of my life. He has challenged me in the area of goal setting to levels I have never experienced. Robert is one of the most trustworthy men I have ever been around. He has helped me improve not only my career but my personal life as well. My life balance as a result of this coaching relationship has been amazing. The results from the investment of time and resources has exceeded my expectations.</i></p>
<p>Bobby Shoemaker, Chic-fil-A Operater</p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<i>Some years ago I learned an amazing statistical reality that with a good coach I could be 86% more effective in my goal accomplishment. 
</i>
</div>
<p><i>Bill Watkins has been my coach for the last few years.  He has been with me through major transitions and decisions offering guidance, perspective, and experience.  He’s been there and done it.  He has started and built profitable organizations.  His experience, his maturity, his character, and ability to communicate have been invaluable to me.  I get the real sense that he believes in me.  He’s not only my coach, but my friend, and has invested heavily in me, and even my family.  He’s a 10 out of 10.  I don’t know why he calls his organization Rusty Lion Academy.  There’s nothing rusty about Bill, except perhaps his beard.</i></p>
<p>Rod Entrekin, Senior Pastor, Christ Church Suwanee</p>
<div>
<p></p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p><i>I reached a point in my business in 2012 when I realized if I wanted New Leaf to continue to grow then I would need to partner with a business coach that could challenge and encourage me as well as my core management team.  I met Robert Mallon several years ago. Over the last two years our team has been more focused on growing our business, our team, implementing core values, setting policies and standards to build upon.  Robert’s thirty plus years of experience has uniquely positioned him to teach, build into, and challenge our team. I believe his business knowledge and servant’s heart sets him apart from the pack.</i></p>
<p>Steve Murray, CEO, New Leaf Landscape Services</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<i>I’ve come to see that building confident, trusting, mentoring relationships is just who Bill is. A keen observer of life experiences, an ever-willing participant, a dedicated listener and absorber of information, Bill is not only hearing you, but actively taking the leap to try to think about and see things as you do, the better to understand.</i></p>
<p><i>Like the most prolific coach &amp; quarterback relationships, Bill coaches you to make your own good decisions or will help coach you out of the melee caused by your last poor decision… or the chaos in which you find yourself from random events. Of course, experience counts.  But what matters more is being able to turn experiences (positive or negative) into useful life lessons to be honed and reapplied over time. It’s a special, if not rare skill and one in which Bill excels. </i></p>
<p><i>Unlike many consultants, coaches, and mentors who seem most interested in convincing you of their worth, you’ll find that Rusty Lions are wired to elevate your worth by unleashing your inner lion.</i></p>
<p>Ben Serotta, Best of Cycling, LLC</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p><i>Robert has been a godsend to our business. His ability to listen, advise, give practical suggestions and referrals has proven fruitful for us. Because of his guidance, we are able to work more efficiently and productively. We are working smarter, not harder since Robert has been our coach.</i></p>

</h3>
<h3><b>A Movie And A Mirror</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>From the beginning, we envisioned The Academy as more than ourselves lasting more than our lifetime. We envisioned a global network of leaders, coaches and mentors using the curriculum we established to improve the lives of men everywhere for generations.</p>
<p>In our early conversations about The Academy, there’s a film out there that we connected over – the ending in particular. In the final ten-minute scene of <i>Mr. Holland's Opus, </i>the main character (Richard Dreyfuss) is surrounded by the people whose lives he made a positive difference in for the last forty years. The auditorium is packed, and he never saw it coming. He just did what he loved all that time but he never felt important or impactful. He was. In his final day, lots of people went to the trouble to come together and tell him so. </p>
<p>With the deepest of humility, we see ourselves in his story.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1208404/files/20150209061312-Men-Together-Teamwork-Friends-10001500099_1_.jpg?1423491192"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>It Will Have Been The Best Of Adventures</b></h3>Our vision of our final moments at The Academy has never been waiting for a paycheck, accolades, or an award. It was to to find ourselves on a stage, as life-long friends, arm-in-arm, looking out happily, humbly, and gratefully on a sea of men – and their families – who we’ve had the privilege to impact powerfully and positively. Within that pensive silence, we'll know that we'll have done what we were supposed to do, something we were very, very good at it, and something that mattered to us and everyone in the audience. And, then, with the crowd looking back at us with one final, collective smile, we'll simply walk off stage into the next chapter of our lives.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1204074/files/20150207135330-Screen_Shot_2015-01-14_at_4.50.07_PM.png?1423346010"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Completing This Project</b></h3>
<p>Unless one or, worse, both of us fall off a cliff hiking the Tetons, we can't see a reason why we won't get this done on time, within budget, and to the world-class standards we've set for ourselves and the Academy.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Three reasons:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
We have been teaching these Principles, Foundational Maxims, and classes for years. We know the material and already have the scripts in our heads.<br/>
</li>
<li>
We've already shot two videos with Remedy Films in Atlanta. Our Indiegogo introduction you saw above was one of them. They are an awesome production company and a world-class partner! They're simply waiting for us to pull the trigger and give them the ""green light"" to begin shooting our teaching videos. We've already talked with them about the where, who, what, how, and when for shooting this first set of five free videos. <br/>
</li>
<li>
We're comfortable ""on camera."" We've been on stage many, many times. Robert's a professional motivational speaker. Bill was a company leader happy to talk anytime in front of employees, customers, vendors, and industry leaders. There'll be no ""we need to learn public speaking"" delay once our Indiegogo campaign is completed. </li>

</div></div>","Our Mission
To make the best men better. We're Rusty Lion Academy.Our Vision, Our Passion
We are here to create a positive, powerful
change in the businesses and lives of Young Lions, ambitious entrepreneurial men between the
ages of 30 and 49.
We coach men on how to build
immensely profitable businesses. We show them how to create hugely favorable
exits that will allow them, one day, to sell these businesses and set a
foundation for their family’s wealth. But that is only half the story. 
No man has ever been happy with a
pocket full of cash and a life devoid of love, relationships, health, purpose, and more. The entrepreneurial journey can put
huge demands on the lives of every entrepreneur - long hours, working weekends, constant
travel, lonely family, and high-stress levels, to name but a few. And unless these demands are
checked and juggled without dropping a ball, they can wreak havoc on our personal lives: broken marriages,
estranged kids, difficult relationships, poor health. Hardly the picture of a
successful man living an extraordinary life. But your business doesn’t have to suck your life away. We want to show good, talented, hard-working men—men who are exactly where we used to be in life—how to build a truly well-rounded life that fluidly adapts to its ebbs and flows. Our curriculum, two-on-one individual coaching, and life-changing retreats have been specifically designed to help busy entrepreneurs achieve the harmonious life-work balance they've always wanted.To The Lion

If you’re a Young Lion at heart, you’ve already got the raw talent, burning
ambition, and practical brilliance it takes to succeed. What you now need are a
couple of experienced guides to help direct your drive, and a strong group of
like-minded men to support you along the journey.Welcome to the pride. We’re
excited you've joined us.

To The LionessAnd if you’re a Lioness reading this, filled with that powerful female drive that supports Young Lions and nurtures their cubs, standing with them shoulder to shoulder in
the family pride while following her own path to leadership and success, know
that we value you immensely. Since our programs take a full-on, professional-and-personal approach to teaching, coaching, and mentoring that covers all
aspects of a man’s life, we don’t claim to be the best mentors for your
development in your own complex role as a professional woman, wife, and mother.
But if you share our ideals and would love to give the Young Lions in your life a
true chance at success, then do send us your men and back up their
entrepreneurial journey by supporting our campaign. We’d love to have you in
our extended pride.







The Problem We Face
We’re
currently teaching local courses and holding face-to-face coaching sessions for
men in our area. And the response has been tremendous: our students love the
coaching we offer and keep telling us we need to bring our teaching to their
friends, too. But there are only so many hours in a day and only so many miles
two men can journey. Time constraints and geographical restrictions,
unfortunately, keep us from reaching many of the men who’ve reached out to us
and asked us to help them change their lives. 
And
this is where YOU come in! We need you to help us make this change happen. 





Changing
the Way We Help Men Reach Their Goals
After
expert consultation and plenty of experimentation, we have determined that the
most effective way to reach men around the globe and educate them about
building a successful life and business is through video classes. Unlike
reading a book, which can be a taxing and isolating after a day’s hard work, a
video class can not only be a lot more fun, it can also be much more engaging
and interactive—offering question&comment sections waiting for instructor feedback—and much
easier to understand and follow.
For this reason, we have decided to bring our
teaching online and reach ambitious men wherever they happen to be. We’ve taken
our best material, tested and fine-tuned through the coaching and classes we offer to our
local students, and have designed engaging video classes for Young Lions all
around the world.
And these classes aren’t just for men either: anyone can
enjoy our educational videos, and learn from their rich content, whether man or
woman, young or old, entrepreneurial or not—there’s really something for
everyone.
This phase of our project will create the first five of our fifteen free video training classes. 




How We’ll
Use the Funds
100% of the campaign funds will go directly to the production of high-quality video classes. Our video partner is Remedy Films in Atlanta, Georgia. All of us are ready to start shooting as soon as the campaign ends and we meet our funding goal.
All
videos we shoot will be FREE for everyone to watch at the online Resource Library
of Rusty Lion Academy. 
The First Five FREE Video Classes 
Here are the first five classes that are all set for production:
1. 
Setting
Your Goals: See it, Believe It, and You Can Achieve It
2. 
Your
Lighthouse Values: What Guides the Course of Your Life?
3. 
Conquer
the Beast: Eliminate What Holds You Back
4. 
What Setting Your 25-Year ""Extraordinary Life"" Intentions Can Do For You
5. 
Warrior
Mornings: How to Start the Perfect Day (a student favorite!)

We know our online video classes will be as effective as coaching a student face-to-face or teaching onstage at one of our retreats. 

Production TimelineMid-March 2015        Close Indiegogo Campaign
End April 2015            Begin shooting our first five videos
End June 2015            Remedy Films will finish production and make the videos                                                      available on our website (barring, of course, any unexpected                                              mishaps).


We (Remedy Films, Robert, Bill) promise to do
our best to honor this timeline, and we’ll keep you updated on our progress in
our weekly emails!
What If We Overfund This Campaign?

Oh, that's easy.
First, we'll smile and feel very humbled, grateful, and privileged that all of you believed in us, our passion, and this project.
Then, we'll keep shooting more of our FREE video series!!


We’ve got a total of
fifteen videos in our free class portfolio. This campaign’s goal is to raise
enough money for the first five classes. If we received more than we’ve
planned, we’re fully prepared to shoot more videos right away.
We'd love to have an ""overfund"" issue to deal with! Thank you :-)

Stretch Goal 1
Here is Phase 2, the next ten free video courses, we will produce in 2015 if we overfund this campaign:
We estimate that phase 2, which comprises the next ten free videos of the series, will cost us around $36,500. As you can see, we expect to save some costs once we find our rhythm and build our methods with the first five videos.
Here are the next ten
titles of the series: 
1. 
From Chaos
to Order: Covey’s Four Quadrants of Priority
2. 
Effective
Feedback & Discipline for Leaders
3. 
Smart
Delegation for Quick Results and More Free Time (yours!)
4. 
Unexpected
Energy Drainers: How to Identify and Avoid Them
5. 
Fear Vs.
Faith: Change Can’t-Do Into Can-Do
6. 
Life Hacks: Your Life, In Order, In Minutes (a student favorite!)
7. 
How to
Listen Like a Leader (and man, and father, and husband, and son, and             brother…)
8. 
Achieving
Emotional Control: Because Roller-Coasters Are Only Fun at Fun-                 Parks
9. 
Motivating
Employees In A Way That You And They Love
10.  Stress CAN Kill You. Seriously.


Stretch Goal 2

There is a phase 3 percolating in our minds. It comprises
another eleven video classes, for a grand total of 26, and we’re estimating it’ll
cost around $40,000. At the moment, we’ve got these classes all neatly planned
in our minds (well, a napkin, actually—bar-stool inspiration and all that…),
but can’t quite share the titles yet. What we can say is that as soon as
production of phases 1 and 2 is underway, we will polish these last classes off
and add them to the plan for late 2015 and early 2016. We’ll keep you updated
via email, of course!

Check Out Our Coaching Perks!
Some of our perks are self-explanatory. 
Some of our best perks like our 2-on-1 Individual and Group Coaching are, well, a bit complicated.
Note that all our coaching is done virtually, i.e, Skype, email, website, and telephone. If you've selected one of our VIP packages, then we'll have the privilege of connecting with you face-to-face! That will give us the chance to experience your world which will make your virtual coaching that much more effective
Check Out Our Retreats Perks!


Two of
our most valuable perks provide you with a reserved spot to one of our breakthrough retreats. These
retreats take place in Jackson, Wyoming, which is the secret ingredient to the
experience we provide.

Majestic, Inspiring, Serenity. Simply Unforgettable: Jackson Hole Wyoming.
The awe-inspiring majesty of Jackson Hole is something everyone should experience at least once in their life. See the Grand Tetons shimmering with snow, watch electric pink Rocky Mountain sunsets, and savor endless opportunities for outdoor fun. Here, breathtaking beauty and unlimited adventure abound!
Where else can you see some of the most iconic wildlife in North America on the 15-minute drive from the airport to your hotel? There’s a good chance you’ll spot bison, elk, pronghorn antelope, and maybe even a moose before you even get to the edge of town.
The iconic beauty of two National Parks, numbers of National Forests, and countless National Wildlife Management areas lie within driving distance of your hotel. In town, you'll find five-star accommodations and restaurants to enjoy every night. Shopping, museums, art, landmarks, history, spas, events, and more also await you every day. 
Jackson is truly a wild, unforgettable, and for our retreat participants, life changing!




Meet The Academy, The Founders, and The Coaches

The Rusty
Lion Academy has been built upon our shared vision for a “space” (physical,
virtual, and emotional) where men can grow and excel both professionally and
personally. When the two of us met in the late 90s, we bonded over similar
interests and values in a friendship that went far deeper than just the casual
phone-call. We've stuck together supporting each other through the thinnest
and thickest of times. 
As a team
we share an intense drive to accomplish our goals and a desire to explore life outside
our comfort zones. But beyond our commonalities, we also have our differences:
the distinct talents and strengths of one that complement and augment those of
the other, so much so that we like to say that in our case, 1+1=3.
In 2013, we joined our life visions officially with the creation of Rusty Lion Academy.
We funded the projected entirely out of our life savings, and sought advice
from some of the world’s most formidable experts such as Brendon Burchard (and
his Experts Academy, where the picture above was taken), and have been coached
by such powerhouse names as John Lee Dumas, Dan Miller, Steve Graves, and James
Roche, just to name a few.
From the
very beginning of this joint adventure, we’ve stuck to our blood oath:
“World-class not half-ass.” That commitment to excellence has made our
journey long and arduous, but above all, worth every second of our time put
into delivering our absolute best to our students!

Bottom-line, it's easy to understand what we do. There are hunting guides, mountain guides, fishing guides, museum guides, and tour guides. We're the ""Extraordinary Life"" guides. 


Robert Mallon


Uncompromising, formidable
excellence


Robert
Mallon is a nationally recognized, professional speaker, business coach,
mentor, and meeting facilitator. His students also like to call him an
“Extraordinary Life Guide.” Over the last 35 years, he’s worked for several
nationally known corporations as a leader and manager. In 2002, he became an
entrepreneur and was soon experienced in starting and running many of his own
businesses. His great passion in life is helping men and their companies
grow to their full potential, a mission he’s now fulfilling through the Rusty
Lion Academy. Robert is happily married to Sandy, who’s been a constant help
and support throughout his entrepreneurial journey, not once calling him or his
ideas crazy. The two of them live in Gainesville, Georgia. Together they
have five spectacular children and a most cherished and precious granddaughter.

Bill Watkins
Understated, commanding authority


Bill
Watkins spent the first half of his life jumping from achievement to
achievement to achievement. A West Point graduate, he first served as an Army
Engineer Officer, while also competing as a world-class cycling athlete, and
later became a Fortune 500 corporate executive. Always the
entrepreneur at heart, however, Bill left that world to start The Marena Group,
which went from shipping from his garage to employing hundreds and exporting to over 80 countries.
When he sold this business in 2012, Bill had achieved life freedom. But, he
wasn’t quite done yet. In this second part of his life, Bill means to give back
everything he’s learnt through his struggles and experiences, and nothing
thrills him quite like seeing the change in the lives of his students. He wants
the next generation of men to master what he knows and has enjoyed: wealth,
significance, and an extraordinary life. Bill is happily married to Donna, who
cheer him on and encourages his dreams. The two of them live in Jackson,
Wyoming, where every day is filled with joy as they experience the beauty and
adventure of the area. They enjoy three grown children—two from Bill’s first
marriage and a very special son-in-law.




Here's What Others Have Said About Us, Our Coaching and Retreats.

It may not seem like it but we're not really ones to talk much about ourselves. We do want you to have confidence we're authentic, ""the real deal."" You can see what others have said about us by scrolling down below.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Before working with Bill and Robert, the goals I was driving toward in my life were fueled by the vapors of long term business success without the foundation of day to day happiness. Mindful of the imbalance between my personal and business life, I spent years reading various books, articles, and blogs.  But no matter what I tried, I would slip back into old routines of working harder building my business at the sacrifice of building my relationships and my personal well being.  When I considered working with a coach, I was skeptical that one could provide any structure or insight that I could not achieve on my own through study and practice. When I started working with Bill and Robert, my old notions of what it would be like to work with a coach was thrown out the window. Bill and Robert have such an incredible ability to help men like me achieve monumental life change.  Their work with me as guides has been nothing short of transformational. Now, my life has a whole new rhythm to it. Bill and Robert have earned my respect, trust, friendship, and sincere gratitude.
Scott Fitzgerald, Owner, Fitzgerald Bicycles 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I met Robert at the right time in my life.  Although things were going well, I had this itching that I was coasting and not employing my full potential.  Robert was like a skilled physician during our first meeting.  He listened, questioned, and examined where I was in life and was quickly able to make an assessment. From that day on Robert put me on a growth plan that keeps accelerating. He started me with small steps until I could begin running on my own.  Now that I am running, Robert is helping to guide the direction that my energy is taking me.  I had studied many of the principles that Robert introduced to me but until you have someone to teach them to you properly, you will never be able to get the most out of them.


Mike Holman, Plant Manager, Baldor Electric----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bill Watkins is one of the most inspirational figures of my life. He has always challenged me to imagine and pursue a career that is both fulfilling and meaningful, while not compromising family life in the process. It’s not just a dream! He had creditability with me from the start because I saw him doing it. In many ways I feel like I got a secret MBA during my time with Bill. The education I received from Bill was far more valuable than any paper degree from an institution. An institution doesn’t challenge you to follow your dreams, pursue your passions and live an uncompromising life the way Bill does. Bill is a great listener and teacher who has the uncanny ability to walk you through your thoughts to enlighten your own path ahead. He helps you see the potential you have to live a life of accomplishment and happiness for both yourself and the people you care about.
John Rogelstad, Senior Business Consultant, Quintiq
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have been working with Robert Mallon for over a year now and it has been one of the best decisions of my life. Robert has helped revolutionize my thinking in all areas of my life. He has challenged me in the area of goal setting to levels I have never experienced. Robert is one of the most trustworthy men I have ever been around. He has helped me improve not only my career but my personal life as well. My life balance as a result of this coaching relationship has been amazing. The results from the investment of time and resources has exceeded my expectations.
Bobby Shoemaker, Chic-fil-A Operater------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some years ago I learned an amazing statistical reality that with a good coach I could be 86% more effective in my goal accomplishment. 


Bill Watkins has been my coach for the last few years.  He has been with me through major transitions and decisions offering guidance, perspective, and experience.  He’s been there and done it.  He has started and built profitable organizations.  His experience, his maturity, his character, and ability to communicate have been invaluable to me.  I get the real sense that he believes in me.  He’s not only my coach, but my friend, and has invested heavily in me, and even my family.  He’s a 10 out of 10.  I don’t know why he calls his organization Rusty Lion Academy.  There’s nothing rusty about Bill, except perhaps his beard.
Rod Entrekin, Senior Pastor, Christ Church Suwanee

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I reached a point in my business in 2012 when I realized if I wanted New Leaf to continue to grow then I would need to partner with a business coach that could challenge and encourage me as well as my core management team.  I met Robert Mallon several years ago. Over the last two years our team has been more focused on growing our business, our team, implementing core values, setting policies and standards to build upon.  Robert’s thirty plus years of experience has uniquely positioned him to teach, build into, and challenge our team. I believe his business knowledge and servant’s heart sets him apart from the pack.
Steve Murray, CEO, New Leaf Landscape Services
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I’ve come to see that building confident, trusting, mentoring relationships is just who Bill is. A keen observer of life experiences, an ever-willing participant, a dedicated listener and absorber of information, Bill is not only hearing you, but actively taking the leap to try to think about and see things as you do, the better to understand.
Like the most prolific coach & quarterback relationships, Bill coaches you to make your own good decisions or will help coach you out of the melee caused by your last poor decision… or the chaos in which you find yourself from random events. Of course, experience counts.  But what matters more is being able to turn experiences (positive or negative) into useful life lessons to be honed and reapplied over time. It’s a special, if not rare skill and one in which Bill excels. 
Unlike many consultants, coaches, and mentors who seem most interested in convincing you of their worth, you’ll find that Rusty Lions are wired to elevate your worth by unleashing your inner lion.
Ben Serotta, Best of Cycling, LLC

Robert has been a godsend to our business. His ability to listen, advise, give practical suggestions and referrals has proven fruitful for us. Because of his guidance, we are able to work more efficiently and productively. We are working smarter, not harder since Robert has been our coach.

A Movie And A Mirror

From the beginning, we envisioned The Academy as more than ourselves lasting more than our lifetime. We envisioned a global network of leaders, coaches and mentors using the curriculum we established to improve the lives of men everywhere for generations.
In our early conversations about The Academy, there’s a film out there that we connected over – the ending in particular. In the final ten-minute scene of Mr. Holland's Opus, the main character (Richard Dreyfuss) is surrounded by the people whose lives he made a positive difference in for the last forty years. The auditorium is packed, and he never saw it coming. He just did what he loved all that time but he never felt important or impactful. He was. In his final day, lots of people went to the trouble to come together and tell him so. 
With the deepest of humility, we see ourselves in his story.



It Will Have Been The Best Of AdventuresOur vision of our final moments at The Academy has never been waiting for a paycheck, accolades, or an award. It was to to find ourselves on a stage, as life-long friends, arm-in-arm, looking out happily, humbly, and gratefully on a sea of men – and their families – who we’ve had the privilege to impact powerfully and positively. Within that pensive silence, we'll know that we'll have done what we were supposed to do, something we were very, very good at it, and something that mattered to us and everyone in the audience. And, then, with the crowd looking back at us with one final, collective smile, we'll simply walk off stage into the next chapter of our lives.

Completing This Project
Unless one or, worse, both of us fall off a cliff hiking the Tetons, we can't see a reason why we won't get this done on time, within budget, and to the world-class standards we've set for ourselves and the Academy.
Why?
Three reasons:



We have been teaching these Principles, Foundational Maxims, and classes for years. We know the material and already have the scripts in our heads.


We've already shot two videos with Remedy Films in Atlanta. Our Indiegogo introduction you saw above was one of them. They are an awesome production company and a world-class partner! They're simply waiting for us to pull the trigger and give them the ""green light"" to begin shooting our teaching videos. We've already talked with them about the where, who, what, how, and when for shooting this first set of five free videos. 


We're comfortable ""on camera."" We've been on stage many, many times. Robert's a professional motivational speaker. Bill was a company leader happy to talk anytime in front of employees, customers, vendors, and industry leaders. There'll be no ""we need to learn public speaking"" delay once our Indiegogo campaign is completed. 

Join Our Pride!




We’re
hugely grateful for your interest to our campaign, and couldn’t be happier that
you took the time to learn about our vision and goals. 
If you’re
a contributor to the campaign, we’d like to THANK YOU for being a part of the
Rusty Lion movement. Your financial contribution to our project will help us
coach Young Lions into becoming better men with highly profitable businesses
and happy families. 
If you’re
unable to contribute financially to our campaign at this point, we still want
to THANK YOU for your interest in our project and for cheering us on. We
couldn’t be doing this without your support. 
If you
share our vision for creating a world of better men, help us spread the word and
reach more full-hearted Lions by sharing our campaign with all your friends on

Hello! My name is Carolina Zamora and I am a pre-med student at Portland State University. This summer, I will be traveling to Ecuador to volunteer, by helping build houses for the less fortunate, as well as to shadow physicians and explore Ecuador along the way. 
What I Need From YOU

In order to accomplish our goal of building houses for the less fortunate, we need YOUR donations! It takes about $5600 to build each home. Our goal this year is to build a total of 21 homes for the unprivileged families we will be helping. 
ALL of the fundraised money goes towards building homes for underprivileged families. Every year the town we select is in a rural area where the families receiving the homes are living below the poverty line. The hope in us building these homes is that it will enable them to reallocate the money they pay for rent to other necessities such as education for their children. 

ALL of the contributions made, no matter how small, will help make a difference in someone else's life. Even if the fundraising goal is not achieved, every contributed dollar will go towards the building of houses in Ecuador.

<p>It’s a ruthless cycle.  When we don’t
move, we tend to become sick, overweight and depressed. When we move,
we get to deal with all kinds of injuries.  I think we just don’t
get how much we don’t know about how we move through our days and
our lives. People generally resist taking action to improve their
posture.</p>
<p></p>

<p> I can help!  If I can spread the word on
how to StraightenUP, we all would possess great posture and body
awareness.</p>
<p>My name is Lorie Kiviat and I’ve been
trying to figure this mess out for over 40 years.  After four decades
of teaching yoga, giving shiatsu therapy and other various body-mind
practices, I got it that there was a certain level of  awareness and
connection to our body that I just couldn’t pin down.  Then about
five years ago, I came across some very early 20<sup>th</sup> century
work on body mechanics and posture.  That work made something click
in me, and for the next three years, I worked on an idea that
together with my experience and what Dr. Mensendieck figured out over
a century ago, led me to this project.</p>
<p>There is a fairly simple solution to
learn to move in ways that help maintain mental and physical clarity
and better health.  I call it StraightenUP, and with some help from
my friends, I wrote a book. The book itself consists of my story,
detailed movement guides and photos to illustrate the movements.  It
combines all the knowledge and information that I have discovered on
this subject.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""""><span style=""font-size: 21px;""></span></p>

<p>So I find myself with a message that I
truly believe could help almost anyone look and feel better, and move
with a grace and confidence that we recognize in those who do.
Martial artists, Dancers, Royalty and even Navy seals have it, an
awareness of alignment, breath and muscle control that is
unmistakable. I think I’ve cracked the code and can make it
possible for all who will try this.  It works because when done again and again, the information
is imprinted on your brain for a lifetime.</p>
<p>The book is printed and it is lovely.
Check the gallery link above for some sample pages. I made an audio
of the book, spent three years teaching this and have more
testimonials as to how awesome and real it is than I can count. There isn’t anyone that cannot devote five minutes a day
for a month to see how phenomenal this is.</p>
<p>Now I need the public to join my
campaign to get this out there.  It is my dream, and I believe in it
heart and soul.  It has been my gift and now I want to pay it forward
for all the blessings I have had in my life.  
</p>
<p>StraightenUp will be a way to remember
things we all should know, and I suspect once did.  Please help me
get this out there, as little things like this can make a big
difference in your life.

Your generosity can help others fulfill their legacy.<br/>
We plan to launch in 2 months.  Prior to starting this crowd-funding page, we raised $75,000 of the $100,000 we needed to launch LegacyComplete.  However, we need to raise the remaining $25,000 before we can launch.  </p>

Estate planning...reinvented.  Most people have something of value they have worked hard to acquire. This might include their home.  Their savings. Sentimental items. Even life lessons and wisdom. But will this legacy they've created be handed down to whom they want, when they want, the way they want?  Not everyone knows the steps to ensure that this will happen.Take a moment to listen to Lisa's story
There are many stories like Lisa’s that end in chaos and heartache!   Wisdom and wealth are lost.  Families are torn apart.  Tragically, loved ones are forced to start from square one rather than building upon the previous generation's hard work.  All of this, as a result of not planning.LegacyComplete is estate planning...reinvented. 


The good news is that all of this chaos and heartache can be easily avoided with proper education and an effective, affordable planning tool. Using a customized revocable living trust as the foundation of the estate plan, the LegacyComplete Program is unique and so much more than a document preparation website. More than a document preparation websiteThe LegacyComplete Program is an award-winning, patent-pending, living trust planning program that can be completed online and includes attorney guidance.  The LegacyComplete Program empowers and educates everyday Americans to:
remain in control of what they have while they are alive and well; 
appoint trusted helpers to manage their financial affairs if they should become incapacitated; 
leave what they have, to whom they want, when they want, the way they want, while passing down their life lessons in addition to their assets, after they are gone.

LegacyComplete realizes that “one size does not fit all.” For this reason, the LegacyComplete Program can be customized to address customers' individual needs.   LegacyComplete.com: effective, easy-to-understand and affordable



From an idea to a prize-winning program to an opportunity for you
The idea for creating a mechanism to provide effective, affordable estate planning was sparked in Chicago Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Business Program in December 2012.
The idea for this planning tool became a reality in October 2014, when the LegacyComplete.com Program won FIRST PLACE in a competition hosted by the University of Chicago's I.J. Clinic on Entrepreneurship and the Chicago Innovation Exchange (competition was sponsored by the Chicago White Sox and Microsoft).



We need your help!

Each dollar you donate moves us one step closer to making effective, affordable, legacy-focused, estate planning available to everyone! Think of the families that can be strengthened and, in turn, the communities that can thrive if creating effective estate planning goes viral. Your generosity can help others fulfill their legacy.
We plan to launch in 2 months.  Prior to starting this crowd-funding page, we raised $75,000 of the $100,000 we needed to launch LegacyComplete.  However, we need to raise the remaining $25,000 before we can launch.  
Our goal of $25,000 will cover the following items:  Completing the website and additional software Marketing & social media management
Filing utility patent application
Technology-related operating expenses
Designing additional educational programming
Presenting at national conventions (please contact Kimberly Brown if you have an event in which you would like us to participate)

<h3>The Dream</h3>
<br/>To create a world wide network of sailing vessels, harnessing the wind to move goods and people around the planet. To travel in a caravan of sailing boats, combining ocean travel with communal living. Effecting positive change wherever we travel. Become a part of the shift towards a more conscious sustainable planet. We aren't trying to fight the existing paradigm. Our revolution comes through creating a new paradigm that will render the old obsolete. <br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1153489/files/20150116070325-20150102-IMG_5507.jpg?1421420605"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>The Storytelling</h3>
<br/>On our travels we encounter some of the most remote cultures on the planet in the islands of the vast Pacific. We bring circus shows and laughter, play music at schools, give workshops on permaculture and recycling. To share the message of free living and traveling by the wind we are going to post all these stories on the platform voiiage.org. <br/><br/>Texts, photos, videos, maps, statistics and audio pieces of music and interviews will come together to create fluent stories of our journey and state of the world in the year 2015.<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1175056/files/20150126110355-Screen_Shot_2015-01-26_at_20.02.55.png?1422299035"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Local recipes, dances, music, drawings, handicrafts, tales and faces coming together on one website, open to any storyteller around the world. To create cultural understanding and to spread the message of how to live in a sustainable, peaceful, and free way together, worldwide. All non-profit and feedback based. <br/><br/>We can make this dream come true. Now, today. Support us and join to help this seed grow by becoming part of our community, wherever you are!<br/><br/><h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<br/>We have many capable sailors, captains, and mechanics. There are many more travelers who want to learn, than space on boats. We are looking for more vessels.  We do not want new boats, we are looking for boats that are currently not in use that we can repair and get back out into the oceans. Anyone who helps us find a boat by donating a boat or connecting us with someone who does can know that they have helped both our community and the planet by taking something unused and turning it into a piece of the change we want to see. These vessels will be a catalyst for teaching and change. They will get used and loved. Once a boat is communal she no longer exists as private property but as community property, owned by everyone sailing on her, captained by an elected community member with the skills and knowledge to keep the boat and crew safe at sea. So if you have a boat you are not using or know someone with a boat please get in touch. We are thankful for any hints and tips that could possibly help us grow our fleet.<br/><br/>We are a community and there are so many other possibilities to help us than just money or boats. We value every skill so if you like what you read and would want to get involved, please contact us. <br/><br/><b>Currently we are  looking for volunteer translators, helpers, lawyers, story tellers and social media people but also clowns, cooks, gardeners, captains, musicians, artists, or anyone with a great message to share with communities around the world!</b>

espetáculos circenses e risos,
tocamos música nas escolas, damos
oficinas sobre permacultura e reciclagem. Para compartilhar a mensagem de vida livre
e viajar com o vento, vamos postar todas essas histórias
sobre o voiiage.org plataforma.<br/>
<br/>
Textos, fotos, vídeos, mapas,
estatísticas e pedaços de áudio de música e entrevistas
vão se reunir para criar histórias fluentes, de nossa
jornada ao longo do mundo no ano de 2015.</span></p>

Landlubbers and Sailors!




After a 10,000 mile journey the Alternative Sailing Community needs your support to repair our two community boats!

###Exclusively watch Libertalia Episode 2, a documentary on the beginnings of our community###






We are a community of eco-conscious travellers sailing around the world. Using  art, music, performance and recycling to sustain our voyage around the earth. Our mission along the way is to:
teach sailing to as many people as possible, including backpackers, travellers, schoolchildren and locals
spread smiles through circus performance and music 
share what we know about sustainable living methods 


learn what we can about the cultures around the world, how they interact with the planet and each other

recycle whenever possible. Boat parts, food, clothing, and anything else we can to move away from a consumerist society
live as a community of travellers, a world family of sailors and sea gypsies
connect alternative land based communities around the world by moving goods and people from place to place
provide an alternative means of travel by harnessing the wind and moving away from our dependance on fossil fuels and limited resources

tell the stories of our journey together, the cultures we encounter, and living in a traveling community on the cross-media storytelling platform voiiage.org 




We have just finished our crossing of the pacific, celebrated our one year anniversary, and are continuing our voyage around the world sailing north from New Zealand in May. Our first stop will be the Fiji island group. After a 10,000 mile journey our first boat Starseeker needs some refitting and our new boat needs gear to get her ready for offshore voyaging. WOO-HOO! 

Thats right! We are super excited to introduce to you LARE. Our community's second vessel, a 45ft gaff rigged schooner. She's a traditional schooner painted black, we got ourselves a pirate ship!
We need you and we count on you!



Our project is grassroots. We don't have any banners and don't sell space for commercials on our website or voiiage.org. We want the project to remain financially independent from big sponsors and companies and that's why we count on your support!We cannot do this without you! We need $5000 to complete the repairs on our boats and keep them seaworthy. With a small donation from you we can continue our voyage, helping to create the change we want to see on our planet!After having refit our vessels they will be used to teach as many travellers as possible how to sail. We will be giving sailing lessons in Northland, New Zealand around April 2015. The lessons will be open to anyone who is interested! 
Every last coin of the money raised will go into buying parts and completing repairs!


We do all the work ourselves to keep the costs as low as possible!

The Perks
Community life for us is about sharing and we want to give back to all the beautiful people around the world that make this journey possible! That is why we spent endless hours to come up with things we can give back to you.The result are different Perks that you can see and choose from on the left. DECKHAND/$25



For 25$ we will send you an exclusive link to our documentary ""Libertalia"" that tells the story of the very beginning of our community.
It's a seven part web series by the incredible film makers Arnault Labaronne & Caroline Gerdolle. Watch the first Part here:

SECOND MATE/50$

Receive an exclusive download link to 15 wallpapers taken by our own photographer Ramin Krause in New Zealand. May they make you smile every time you look at them! Of course you can share them with your friends and family.




FIRST MATE/100$
Have you been staring at the empty spot at you wall for some time now? Fill it with a printed photo by Ramin Krause. Choose one of the wallpapers or any other photo on www.raminkrause.com and we will send you the link to a High-Resolution Photo file with the GPS-Coordinates and the story behind the photo.
 

BOSWAIN/250$



Let us scream out your name far out on sea, while drinking rum and telling stories!

___________________________________________________________________________The more funds we reach the more boats we can access! That way we can enable even more people to experience the sea, traveling in a community and sharing our vision of a new sustainable planet. And once they have learned it they can go out to share it with even more people. A Snowball of sorts. Yay!


The Dream
To create a world wide network of sailing vessels, harnessing the wind to move goods and people around the planet. To travel in a caravan of sailing boats, combining ocean travel with communal living. Effecting positive change wherever we travel. Become a part of the shift towards a more conscious sustainable planet. We aren't trying to fight the existing paradigm. Our revolution comes through creating a new paradigm that will render the old obsolete. 

The Storytelling
On our travels we encounter some of the most remote cultures on the planet in the islands of the vast Pacific. We bring circus shows and laughter, play music at schools, give workshops on permaculture and recycling. To share the message of free living and traveling by the wind we are going to post all these stories on the platform voiiage.org. Texts, photos, videos, maps, statistics and audio pieces of music and interviews will come together to create fluent stories of our journey and state of the world in the year 2015.
Local recipes, dances, music, drawings, handicrafts, tales and faces coming together on one website, open to any storyteller around the world. To create cultural understanding and to spread the message of how to live in a sustainable, peaceful, and free way together, worldwide. All non-profit and feedback based. We can make this dream come true. Now, today. Support us and join to help this seed grow by becoming part of our community, wherever you are!Other ways you can help
We have many capable sailors, captains, and mechanics. There are many more travelers who want to learn, than space on boats. We are looking for more vessels.  We do not want new boats, we are looking for boats that are currently not in use that we can repair and get back out into the oceans. Anyone who helps us find a boat by donating a boat or connecting us with someone who does can know that they have helped both our community and the planet by taking something unused and turning it into a piece of the change we want to see. These vessels will be a catalyst for teaching and change. They will get used and loved. Once a boat is communal she no longer exists as private property but as community property, owned by everyone sailing on her, captained by an elected community member with the skills and knowledge to keep the boat and crew safe at sea. So if you have a boat you are not using or know someone with a boat please get in touch. We are thankful for any hints and tips that could possibly help us grow our fleet.We are a community and there are so many other possibilities to help us than just money or boats. We value every skill so if you like what you read and would want to get involved, please contact us. Currently we are  looking for volunteer translators, helpers, lawyers, story tellers and social media people but also clowns, cooks, gardeners, captains, musicians, artists, or anyone with a great message to share with communities around the world!

And now all we can do is wait and hope and prepare for our big journey! Thank you for taking time to read this!

O SONHO
Criar uma rede mundial de embarcações à vela,  aproveitamento o vento
para transportar mercadorias e pessoas
ao redor do planeta. Para viajar em uma caravana de barcos a vela, combinando viagens marítimas
com a vida comunitária. Efetuar mudanças positivas sempre que viajamos. Torne-se uma
parte da transição para um
planeta sustentável mais
consciente. Nós não estamos tentando
combater o paradigma existente.
Nossa revolução vem através da criação de um novo paradigma
que irá processar o obsoleto.

Contando histórias

Em nossas viagens nos deparamos com
algumas das culturas mais remotas
do planeta nas ilhas do vasto Pacífico. Trazemos
espetáculos circenses e risos,
tocamos música nas escolas, damos
oficinas sobre permacultura e reciclagem. Para compartilhar a mensagem de vida livre
e viajar com o vento, vamos postar todas essas histórias
sobre o voiiage.org plataforma.

Textos, fotos, vídeos, mapas,
estatísticas e pedaços de áudio de música e entrevistas
vão se reunir para criar histórias fluentes, de nossa
jornada ao longo do mundo no ano de 2015.

Receitas locais, danças, músicas, desenhos, artesanato, contos e rostos que se juntam em
um site, aberto a qualquer contador
de histórias ao redor do mundo.

mensagem de como viver de forma
sustentável, pacífica e livre, juntos em todo o mundo. Tudo sem
fins lucrativos e baseado em feedback.

There are many people in the world that ask themselves, ""why can't I have a baby, why can't I love, why can't I be successful, why can't I serve the Lord, why can't I fit in, why can't I stay on the straight and narrow path, why can't I save myself for marriage, why can't I live a holy & godly life, why can't I have a disability,  why can't I be a entrepreneur, why can't I achieve a degree, why can't I persevere through it all."" I am here to say, Why Not Me? All these things are common questions for me just as well as others around the world. With your support I am determined to spread the message and show others that despite the common ""Why Not Me"" questions it is possible!I am determined to open up my own personal intimate boutique in Downtown Las Vegas, Nevada at Downtown Container Park owned by CEO Tony Hsieh of Zappos.

<p>Hi! My name is Rebecca. I am a wife and mother of 3 beautiful children but wear many other hats as a lot of us tend to do. But one very important hat I am happy and very passionate about wearing is my desire to help those in need or just down on their luck. We all at some pointe and time in our lives have needed just a little help to get us over that bump in the road. My husband and I try our best to do as much as humanely possible to do these ""random blessings"" as I call it but I can only imagine the volume of these blessings that we could continue to do with your contributions! And sometimes it's not a NEED, it's just showing a nice gesture. Ever since my kids have been in school, on those cold 20 degree mornings, I stop and get coffee and give to the teachers who are awaiting outside for the arrival of the kids to make sure they get into school safe. Each morning when I pass the Food Bank, and I see people standing in line on those same cold weather mornings,  my heart breaks and I'm thinking I wished I had a bag full of gift cards to the nearest grocery store to go pass out. Or the woman I overhear in the store telling her daughter how many candles they would need until they could get enough money to get the lights cut back on. In the world we live in today, people need to know someone still cares! And I know there are plenty of people who would like to help but don't know how to or just don't have the time. But if you would take just enough time to contribute... ""M712"" will do the rest for you!!! And no one can put a dollar value on the impact YOU WILL make! So please, give from your heart and let's start spreading more of these ""RANDOM  BLESSINGS!""</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I started out with a goal of $100,000.00 because with this type of program, the possibilities are endless. The more we raise the more lives that can be touched. If this is something that I can continue to do for years to come, I PROMISE you, I will do it even if it's a $1  balance!</p>
<p>Now I believe in giving credit where credit is due. I would like to have a ""Contributer of the week"" every week so others can see who all is sharing in my passion for this cause and to put a face with the heart who is thinking of others!</p>
<p>Like I stated previously, my husband and I have been doing this for years so there is no doubt in my mind that ANY funds will go un-used!!!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Can you imagine the difference or outlook people could have when these random blessings start to happen to them!  You see , the difference in ""M712"" and local agencies on the corner office is , there's no application to fill out or wait time. No approval needed, no one asking a million questions before giving assistance with a need. These are surprise, random and not requested. We want to pay for the groceries of the person in front of me that had to put items back due to not having enough money, or fill the gas tank up of the man who is counting out pennies to pay for $2.43 worth of gas. And what's so exciting, I never know when an opportunity will arise either as they are random on my end and the receiver! The look on their face is priceless!!!!!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Now with any project there are risks and questions. I'm sure someone reading this May be thinking, ""What if that person is really not in need."" But if you noticed the name of my campaign, it's called ""M712"" That's in reference to the scripture Matthew 7:12, which is commonly known as the Golden Rule. To do unto others as you would have them do unto you. And that's how I live my life daily. We can't get caught up on the ""What if's"" when it's time to help others. We just have to know that OUR actions and contributions are done with good intentions and from our heart. And with that, we will in returned be blessed ourselves. So don't let anyone steal your joy , YOUR blessings or opportunity to make a difference in someone's life.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul> <li>If you can not give financially, spread the word and make some noise about this campaign.</li> <li>And don't forget, it takes more than one tool to build a ship!

<li>In addition to booth fees, we need to secure a display setup, transportation for the booth inventory and display and advertising via tradeshow publications, estimating $2,500-$3,000.00</li> <li>We have no shortage of creative people participating in Team Shiny! Check out our perks for opportunities to receive cards printed with our artwork, exclusive campaign t-shirts, and even opportunities to contribute to our future product line!

</div><h4><b>Who I am</b></h4><p>Hi there! My name is Jarrad and I’m trying to help charities all over the world. As an employee at a large non-profit hospital system in Pennsylvania, I hear many stories of people in need and my many coworkers who impact the lives of those with needs. Unfortunately, being in the Information Technology department, I don’t get to impact those lives personally and I wanted to come up with some way to help people. That’s when <b>Can <font color=""red"">You</font> Give</b> was born. </p><h4>What I'm Proposing</h4><p>Through the simple act of shopping, you can help to make this world a better place. Before you stray away from this campaign, please let me explain how this is possible. Through the use of something called Affiliate Marketing, my plan is to put together a website where you can access retailers all over the world. Clicking on the links on our site will tag your purchases so that the retailer knows that you came from our site. Once you make your purchase, the retailer pays an Affiliate Marketing company and that Affiliate Marketing company pays us. Once they pay us, we pay the charities. My goal is to crowdsource the funds for the startup so that I can pass 100% of the funds from the retail purchases to the charities. </p><h4>Why I'm doing this</h4><p>I am pursuing this because I see wasted potential. Every time you shop online at your favorite retailer, a portion of that could be going to fund medical care to underprivileged children, feed the homeless, or house and provide counsel to abused women. The possibilities are endless and with <b>Can <font color=""red"">You</font> Give</b>, I hope to have the opportunity to help those in need while making it easier for others to do the same. </p><h4>What about overhead?</h4><p>The current annual overhead is estimated to be very low. The server that the website is housed on has a lifetime subscription, the domain name is paid for by me each year and I plan to donate at least 10 hours per month for upkeep, check writing and pursuing additional retailers. The legal filing fees and registered agent services are the only commitments that I foresee. </p><h4>What your contribution will fund</h4><p>In order to file as a non profit in the state of Pennsylvania, I need reserve the <b>Can <font color=""red"">You</font> Give</b> name, submit articles of incorporation, select a registered agent and apply for a 501(c)(3) to obtain federal non-profit status. Each of these items has a fee schedule associated with it. Any remaining funds will be used to pay a website designer, preferably one associated with a small business. </p><h4>What is in it for you</h4><p>As a contributor, you will be the first to be notified when the site is up and running. You will receive regular status reports about how much money was raised, which charities were contributed to as well as any new retailers that have been added to the website. </p><p>If you are able to be more financially generous, you are welcome to take advantage of the perks listed to the right. They may not be much, but the impact will be huge.</p><p>If you are technologically gifted in the PHP coding language or are exceptionally gifted with web design and would like to donate your services, Id be happy to accept your help and lower the amount of funds that Im requesting.</p><p></p></div>","Who I amHi there!

<p><strong>The Time Line:</strong></p>
<p><i>Summer 2010:</i></p>
<p><i></i>I found myself at Mzoli’s Place - a place like you've never seen before- in Gugulethu just outside Cape Town.  Mzoli's is known for its vibrant parties, diverse patronage and, of course, its signature meats.  The sights, sounds and smells (oh! the smell of that meat!) made for an amazing atmosphere that forever changed me.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

</div><div>
<br/>
<p><i>Summer 2011:</i></p>
<p>10,000 miles away from Mzoli's and I couldn't get that experience out of my head - I wanted to share it!  I set off to re-create the same atmosphere by gathering as many friends as I could and roasting a whole pig! I always enjoyed cooking and entertaining, but after that pig roast I was absolutely hooked. </p>
<p><i>Summer 2012:</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>

<p><i>Summer 2013 &amp; 2014: Creating Porklandia</i></p>
<p>In 2013 I moved to Portland and kept the party going - with a new great name! New friends and new meats made for new incredible experiences! Now I've got <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">4 roasts under my belt with rounds of recipe tweaking, tasting, and an inappropriate amount of pork and smoke inhaled. </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></i></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Summer 2015 and Beyond!</i><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Every year in the fleeting days of summer I feel that buzz around the Porklandia experience!  However, to truly make this the party of the year we need to share it with as many people as possible!  </span></p>
<p>We can do this!</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Now ... The Problem:</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Up until this year I've paid for everything out of pocket - including renting the spit to roast the pig. Man that gets expensive - but is totally </span>worth<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> it!</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This summer I was preparing for another great year of Porklandia pig roast and was especially excited because I had just found the smoker of my dreams! All the catering events could be done and any sized animal would be smoked!!!</span><br/></p>
<p>Then, two days before July 4th it was stolen. I believe by terrorists - cause who does that two days before the 4th?!?!?! </p>
<p>So ... I'm looking to buy a new Smoker and take Porklandia to the next level.</p>
<p>To truly make this a community event, I need help growing it.  That's where you come in.  </p>

</div></div>","The Time Line:
Summer 2010:
I found myself at Mzoli’s Place - a place like you've never seen before- in Gugulethu just outside Cape Town.  Mzoli's is known for its vibrant parties, diverse patronage and, of course, its signature meats.  The sights, sounds and smells (oh! the smell of that meat!) made for an amazing atmosphere that forever changed me. 
    


Summer 2011:
10,000 miles away from Mzoli's and I couldn't get that experience out of my head - I wanted to share it!  I set off to re-create the same atmosphere by gathering as many friends as I could and roasting a whole pig! I always enjoyed cooking and entertaining, but after that pig roast I was absolutely hooked. 
Summer 2012:




Summer 2013 & 2014: Creating Porklandia
In 2013 I moved to Portland and kept the party going - with a new great name! New friends and new meats made for new incredible experiences! Now I've got 4 roasts under my belt with rounds of recipe tweaking, tasting, and an inappropriate amount of pork and smoke inhaled. 


Summer 2015 and Beyond!
Every year in the fleeting days of summer I feel that buzz around the Porklandia experience!  However, to truly make this the party of the year we need to share it with as many people as possible!  
We can do this!



   

Now ... The Problem:
Up until this year I've paid for everything out of pocket - including renting the spit to roast the pig. Man that gets expensive - but is totally worth it!
This summer I was preparing for another great year of Porklandia pig roast and was especially excited because I had just found the smoker of my dreams! All the catering events could be done and any sized animal would be smoked!!!
Then, two days before July 4th it was stolen. I believe by terrorists - cause who does that two days before the 4th?!?!?! 
So ... I'm looking to buy a new Smoker and take Porklandia to the next level.
To truly make this a community event, I need help growing it.  That's where you come in.  

Want to make Porklandia the ""can't miss"" event of the summer?
Want to help get Porklandia Catering off the ground?
If you love pork, contribute.
If you love food, contribute .
If you like good people, contribute.
If you love new experiences, contribute.
If you like to dance funny, contribute.
If you want a great summer, contribute.
If you want dreams to come true, contribute.
If you like to contribute, um, contribute. 
If you don’t have money to contribute, share.
If you do have money to contribute, share!

Wanna little sumpin’ sumpin’ in return?
Take a look at your Perks here!
Oh, and in case you’re interested.
Here’s what your hard earned money’s going toward-->(the Smoker of my dreams)
If we raise all of the funds that's what we’ll get … but if we can’t … then we’ll pay for the party and get ready next year!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><h1>The Idea</h1>
<p>
We are some aspiring web designers, graphic
designers and translators who are optimistic about establishing a
full-fledged, state-of-the-art ‘Multimedia and Advertising Studio’
here in Bulgaria. This is a very rare initiative to establish
something of this sort in our poverty ridden region.     
</p>
<p>
We believe that this initiative will create employment for our young
people who roam about the streets in search of a job.Therefore we decided to hire only Kids and young abdults, younger than 29 years old, even if they are less educated - we will take care of this if they are willing to learn.  We also believe
that this initiative will also help our community to be more
developed and modernized. By understanding the significance of this
initiative, our government has provided a primary fund to accommodate
the cost of the equipment and salaries of the 9 employees for a year.
But in order to get going and fulfill our dream of developing the
region, provide our youths with employment, we need more funds and
that’s where we seek your utmost attention. 
</p>
<p>
</p><h1>What we want to do</h1>
<p>
The purpose of this initiative is to establish a creative multimedia
and advertising agency. The firm will be offering various services
such as designing, filming, programming, professional writing, and
translating. It should be mentioned that we will be serving the
clients of our country as well as the clients in foreign countries
and hence it is very important for us to set up a suitable workplace
here in Bulgaria. Our firm will work as a creative agency that will
have a printing department, a designing department, a programming
department, and a writing and translation department. According to
our initial estimation, we will be needing 9 employees to offer all
the mentioned services. For this, we are planning to hire talented
young people who excel in their respective fields. 
</p>
<p>
The hired employees’ compensation/salary is being taken care of
from the EU/Government granted fund. But, as the current monthly
salary is very minimal (less than 300 Euro/350
USD), it is very difficult to attract young and talented people to
work for us. Hence, we need to offer a lucrative amount to attract
the potential employees. 
</p>
<p>
One might ask, “Why does a creative agency need translators?"".
Well, to answer this question, we must project the potentials first.
Bulgaria is a country with just over 7 million people and it hasn’t
been able to provide sufficient numbers of translators yet. As
translating service has a high demand and many foreign clients are
asking for this service, it is very logical to hire a translator for
our firm.

<h1>What we have and what we need</h1>
<p>
</p><p>
We have taken care of the minimal salaries for a year, basic
equipment like Furniture, Computers, Cameras and even a Drone. We
have also managed some studio and printing equipment. We have also
started promoting our initiative through various marketing channels.
So far, all these investment total around 48,000 EUR / $55,000. We
have also managed a suitable office space (which has an area more
than 1000 square feet) at a monthly rent of 300 Euro / $350. Still,
we need some funds for office supplies, decoration, and day to day
operating cost for the first year of operation. As we are hoping that
our business will break-even in the following year, these are some of
the expenses we need to take care off for the first year.

</p><h1>Risks / Challenges 
</h1>
<p>
Our first challenge will be to find qualified and talented employees.
There are not many SEO-Experts, 3D-animators and expert designers in
a town of 10000 people. So, we have to recruit people from nearby
towns. We hope to get employees directly from the University of
Veliko Turnovo. We believe that the fresh graduates from this
institutions will be able to bring expertise and enthusiasm in the
workplace. We should also acknowledge that due to our limited human
resource, we will not be able to take care of all the appointed jobs
of our own. Hence, we will outsource some of our responsibilities to
experts working in the modern Capital of Bulgaria, Sofia or other Big
Towns. We are confident that we will be able to manage all the
responsibilities and help our region grow both in terms of skills and
expertise. 
</p>
<p>
A very small but crucial piece of information; our initiative will
not be facing any harsh competitions in the region and hence the
probability of success is very high for us. 
</p>
<h1>Your donation can make a difference 
</h1>
<p>
So why should you support us? Your donation, even a small one, helps
to get a less developed region closer to the modern world. Your
donation also gets young people to have a job in their region, even
in their hometown. By donating for this initiative, you will be
contributing to the development of this very country, Bulgaria.   
</p>
<p>
You will also show people, that they aren't left alone, cut off from
the world. You will be able to reach the rural people and make them
understand the beauty and usefulness of this strange thing called
""The Internet"" and the community behind it. You will also
introduce them with some enthusiastic people who are willing to
achieve something amazing for themselves, for the community, and for
the country. 
</p>
<p>
We will be grateful to you for your contribution. For a small amount
of donation, you get great gestures of gratitude and for a little
more, you get things that can really help your business identity to
grow or give your personal appearance a glow. </p>

donation also gets young people to have a job in their region, even
in their hometown. By donating for this initiative, you will be
contributing to the development of this very country, Bulgaria.   


You will also show people, that they aren't left alone, cut off from
the world. You will be able to reach the rural people and make them
understand the beauty and usefulness of this strange thing called
""The Internet"" and the community behind it. You will also
introduce them with some enthusiastic people who are willing to
achieve something amazing for themselves, for the community, and for
the country. 


We will be grateful to you for your contribution. For a small amount
of donation, you get great gestures of gratitude and for a little
more, you get things that can really help your business identity to
grow or give your personal appearance a glow.

are enormous. Their communal lands are decimated after generations of
unsustainable farming methods. The topsoil is all but gone, but, thankfully,
the lands have never been poisoned by chemicals and therefore can easily be
regenerated.  All that is needed is knowledge, guidance and assistance
which we aim to provide. We will regenerate the land, redesign it on contour
and install water harvesting swales complete with beneficial plants. We will
also establish the foundations of food forests in marginal lands. This will give

<p>Our food security is at risk. Most agricultural land has become food deserts with monoculture (a single species crop) and it's associated chemicals ensuring that. It has become so critical that we are now genetically modifying our food in an attempt to increase yields and make our food more chemically friendly. Yip, CHEMICALLY FRIENDLY FOOD, go figure!<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>                                        </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The only logical way to ensure our food security is to return small family farmers to the land as these are the people who really care for the soil and who produce good healthy food like our grandparents used to eat.</p>

<p>Early childhood is a critical time. These early, formative years serve as the foundation for all of life's later endeavours. If, as a society, we fail to meet the needs of our young children, it is not just the children who suffer. We, as a society, suffer as well. Their success is our success. Let's not fail them...or ourselves!<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story.Greetings all good people. My name is Ken Strang, the Founder of The Retsogile Permaculture Education & Training Trust and I'm here to invite you to join me on an incredible journey of giving.Life threw me a curve-ball in the form of failing health and I was put-out-to-pasture. After receiving my pension pay-out and taking a hard look as to ''where to now'' I found myself in the enviable position of having more than I needed for the time I had left. I then realised that, at last, I could be the change I want to see, I could contribute positively, I could give back. There is no doubt in my mind that my generation (baby-boomers and siblings) have been the greatest consumers of all time and that we have a debt to repay, a responsibility to repair the damage we have done.




I am a great believer in the Permaculture way which will not only help alleviate poverty through providing people with the means to feed themselves sustainably but is also a climate change mitigation method in that all the plants extract carbon from the air and fix it back into the soil. People Care! Earth Care! Fair Share!With this goal in mind, I have started a new and exciting
final journey of my life, a rewarding journey that I invite you to join me on.
I have dedicated half my pension monies and half my farm, complete with full
infrastructure, to this cause. I have established a charitable non-profit Trust,
The Retsogile Permaculture Education & Training Trust. A legally
constituted and registered NPO dedicated to improving the lives of the poor
rural folk in South



 Africa. The word Retsogile is a Sepedi (North Sotho) word
meaning ‘’we are standing up’’, ‘’we are getting to work’’. (Pronounced Ret-sue-g-wheelie with the g being gutteral)
The Trust is a collective of like-minded young people who are concerned with the ever increasing level of poverty in South Africa and food security for their families.
Please allow me to introduce the Trustees.
Corle, Shannna, Linah, Cobus and Kyle....and the current teamFront:  Maria, Grace, Rose (1), Magdalene, Queen. (Workers)Back: Andre'. Rose (2). Xola and Anthony. (Volunteers)...and the kiddies...we involve them in everything so they are also team members.OPERATION.The Trust will operate in a dual mode, being a profitable business and an NPO side by side;1. Profitable.  i. Training.  ii. Demonstration Site.  iii. Venue hire.2. NPO.  i. Profits from above.  ii. Donors and sponsorships.
GOALS.

Raising funds through profitable
training programmes and donors and which funds will be used to provide free
education and training to subsistence farmers to assist them in increasing
their yields and varieties sustainably;
To establish food gardens in rural
schools to add value to the School Feeding Scheme (this will have the added
benefit of exposing the students to the ethics of Permaculture and teaching the
students to grow food), and;
To embark on community outreach
programmes in the field of Early Childhood Development by assisting and
training educators and care-givers.

BENEFITS.The benefits to the rural poor
are enormous. Their communal lands are decimated after generations of
unsustainable farming methods. The topsoil is all but gone, but, thankfully,
the lands have never been poisoned by chemicals and therefore can easily be
regenerated.  All that is needed is knowledge, guidance and assistance
which we aim to provide. We will regenerate the land, redesign it on contour
and install water harvesting swales complete with beneficial plants. We will
also establish the foundations of food forests in marginal lands. This will give
the communities the food security they so desperately need. Our starting point
is the Segwashi community and our goal is one communal land per annum.






Just as a
child should not go to bed hungry, so too, a child cannot learn on an empty
stomach. We will establish food gardens in poor rural schools to add value, in
the form of fresh vegetables and fruit, to the current government school
feeding scheme. We will teach the children from a young age the importance of
healthy food and how to grow it and the need to respect and care for the Earth
and all its life forms. This will help to develop a generation that will change
the way we treat the Earth and each other, a caring generation. Our starting
point is Glenshiel Primary School, where we have already started, and Segwashi Primary School and our goal is
one school food garden every six months.




Many elderly
folk are caring for their children’s children on their meagre pensions and
therefore most of these children do not have any pre-school guidance and
tuition. We aim to change this by establishing pre-school centres and assisting
and training educators and care-givers in Early Childhood Development. This
will have the benefit of the timely development of motor skills and other
important aspects of their development as well as identify any shortfalls early
in their development so that these can be concentrated on. Our starting point
is the Segwashi community and our goal is one pre-school per annum.


ACHIEVE GOAL 1.
How do we plan to achieve our first goal?

We will provide free training to subsistence
farmers and equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills required to farm
sustainably.
We will provide financial and practical
assistance to subsistence farmers to repair and regenerate their lands and to
implement a relevant Permaculture design to their lands to ensure the
sustainability of said lands. This will require installing water-harvesting
swales (ditches or depressions) on contour every 20 meters and planting the
berms with beneficial plants such as nitrogen fixers and dynamic accumulators.
Our starting point is the Segwashi community and
our goal is one communal land per annum.
ACHIEVE GOAL 2.
How do we plan to achieve our second goal?

We will conduct school tours on the
demonstration site to expose the learners to all aspects of sustainable living
and farming. Here they will witness alternate energy sources such as wind and
solar as well as bio-gas from manure. They will also experience correct and
humane animal husbandry methods, contour farming, mulch application, seed
collection and storage, soil preservation and regeneration techniques,
water-harvesting techniques and much more.
We will establish food gardens in schools
according to the Permaculture methodology and will involve the educators and
learners in these projects from day one ensuring the transfer of the necessary
skills and knowledge at an early stage of the learner’s development.
We will assist in maintaining these gardens by
conducting weekly workshops on site. This will provide us with the opportunity
to impart the necessary knowledge and skills required to rectify any
short-comings and/or reverse any problems, such as diseases, that may occur.
Our starting point is the Glenshiel (already started) and Segwashi
Primary Schools and our goal is one school garden every six months.


ACHIEVE GOAL 3.
How do we plan to achieve our third goal?

We will provide assistance to teachers through a
qualified Early Childhood Development educator to help improve their teaching
methods, if so needed, after observation of lessons given by the teachers. The
ECD educator will also advise of any new or improved techniques that may be
developed.
We aim to establish proper pre-school centres
equipped with the necessary tools required to provide toddlers with a proper
education in their critical formative years. To ensure this we will train
pre-school teachers and care-givers on site and seek bursaries and/or sponsorships
for those that are capable and show promise.

Our starting point is the Segwashi community and
our goal is one pre-school per annum. Obviously we would like to achieve more but we prefer to set realistic and    achievable goals. progress will depend on funding!
   What We Need & What You Get
I have already contributed ZAR159 991.00 (USD12 307.00) being;

3. Teepee for budget accommodation = ZAR14 500.00 (USD1116.)
4. Consulting Arborist = ZAR30 000.00 (USD2308.)
5. Staff remuneration to end September = ZAR61 191 (USD4707)
Further to this, should we be successful in our fundraiser my attorney will deposit a further contribution from me of R100 000 (USD7693), which he is holding in trust for this purpose, into the Trust's bank account.

For your contribution we will return the gesture with a little gift. Check out our perks as they are uniquely African flavoured.


   The Impact
Our food security is at risk. Most agricultural land has become food deserts with monoculture (a single species crop) and it's associated chemicals ensuring that. It has become so critical that we are now genetically modifying our food in an attempt to increase yields and make our food more chemically friendly. Yip, CHEMICALLY FRIENDLY FOOD, go figure!                                        
                   


The only logical way to ensure our food security is to return small family farmers to the land as these are the people who really care for the soil and who produce good healthy food like our grandparents used to eat.




''What the best and most wisest parent wants for their own child, that, must the community want for all its children.'' - John Dewey.

Early childhood is a critical time. These early, formative years serve as the foundation for all of life's later endeavours. If, as a society, we fail to meet the needs of our young children, it is not just the children who suffer. We, as a society, suffer as well. Their success is our success. Let's not fail them...or ourselves!




   Risks & Challenges  An endeavour of this nature has only one inherent risk and that is the risk of failure. A plus factor to mitigate this risk is that this is the kind of endeavour that only attracts those of the same mindset, not career builders.
I face the biggest risk should the endeavour fail, the risk of losing what I have already contributed. I accept that risk with open arms as the rewards from success far outweigh the surplus I risk to lose.
The Trust's biggest obstacle will be raising enough resources to tackle the enormous task it has undertaken. The magnitude of this task must not be under-rated, millions of people in my home province of Limpopo alone, are affected by hunger and illiteracy. We will engage the services of a professional fundraiser to ensure a steady flow of Corporate funding and sponsorships of learners.


   Other Ways You Can Help

Not only is it an opportunity for me to get my hands dirty but I am finally able to create
something. It was what I missed most in my various office jobs in Vienna and
New York. When I finally pulled the plug on my corporate career and moved to
California to make wine, it dawned on me: I can finally MAKE Grüner

I researched a number of ways to make this special white wine more widely
accessible to the American public but was stopped short at the sheer lack of
volume available for export. As Austria’s “national grape”, Grüner Veltliner is
not only the most widely planted grape variety in the country but also consumed
by its co-nationals leaving very little to share with the rest of the world.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>To

<p><b>The Problem We Hope To
Solve</b></p>

ATRE project is aimed
at helping in the fight against climate change because it produces energy with
zero emissions and no environmental impact. This project will help in making
sure everyone or organizations that need electricity get it readily available
at a low cost with little maintenance. ATRE envisions providing home dwellers,
cities,  rural communities and isolated areas  and industries with electricity. Imagine meeting
your <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">electricity
needs with an ATRE power station, then you will have no need for a national
electricity grid.</span><p></p>
<p><b>What We Have Done So Far</b></p>
<p>During
the past 3 years the inventor has done research and experimental work on ATRE
circuitry design and the development of the basic operating principles to
generate an electrical current using very opposing metals to contact one
another to form an Earth Ambient Temperature Resistant Battery Cell.</p>
<p>The battery cell created is a very simple galvanic cell separated by graphite-magnesium crystals.  The crystals are placed under opposing force conditions with the help of an electro-magnetic array of conductors and a special designed magnetic non conductive water plug.  The Oxygen component in water carries electrons that cause a reaction with the water plug that induce a negative charge to the crystal graphite layers, allowing the water oxygen molecules to pass valence electrons to the crystal top surface, creating an electrostatic discharge to the inductors in the magnetic array, creating a voltage and low but constant electrical current.  This reaction appears to be constant as long as the water is in direct contact to the earth through a copper pin and cable that joins to an opposing earth metal antenna.</p>
<p>Six proto-types were built to test various approaches towards the
generation of constant electric current using free media such as metals,
crystals and water components, Hydrogen and Oxygen. The inventor believes the
model as proposed in the promotional video will be the closest solution humans
ever achieved, trying to create a form of free electrical current. </p>
<p><b>How Much Money We Need</b></p>
<p>We
believe $35000 CAD will be sufficient to complete patent 2 865 299 and register
the business, these funds if raised will help us in the filing of additional six
patents related to the ATRE Power Station as envisioned in the video.  It is also estimated that sufficient funding
will remain at about $12000 to complete the first production tooling for manual
assembly (not robotic assembly) of an ATRE Power System Commercial Proto-type.  This proto-type will go on public display.</p>
<p><b>Why ATRE Technology</b></p>
<p><span>-  </span>Compact
Design and very scalable technology. It can go very large or very small     to
cellphone or laptop size depending on what you want.</p>
<p><span>-  </span>Easy

<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b></b></h3>
<p><b>Challenges Ahead.</b></p>
<p>We know we are producing a constant electrical current with the invention of this technology for this project.  Risks are in the input power requirements of battery charge controllers that are currently available in the market.  ATRE may require a new approach.  </p>

Risks and challenges


With craft breweries opening at an unprecedented rate, the need to stand out and be different will become much more important. We believe our unique story does just that but may present us with the challenge of keeping up with demand in the future. 
Producing small batch beers means there aren't many out there in the market, but we are confident in our current system being able to produce enough beer for those who want it. If necessary, however, we can meet these demands through contract brewing arrangements with larger breweries. 
We will do our best to brew as traditionally as possible on their systems, but some tweaks to the process may have to be made. Of course, a really easy way to solve this potential issue is to help us raise well over our goal so we can get started on our own brewery as soon as possible!

</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Small Community, Big Dreams</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Building a sustainable future for communities in Afghanistan</i></p><p>
</p><p>Emerging from the Taliban governance 14 years ago, the
Bamyan area has faced many challenges in fighting poverty.  Only a small proportion of the land is
cultivatable, the rangelands have been degraded from overgrazing, and the efficiency
of the farming remains low.</p>
<p>Beekeeping has been identified as one of the most
promising microenterprises to eliminate poverty and empower women in Afghanistan’s
Bamyan area.  It provides cash income and
contributes to food security, as well as providing opportunities for female
economic independence in a socially acceptable way.</p>
<p>BEES is a micro-enterprise seeking to promote
beekeeping in the Bamyan area.  The
project has the potential to transform the lives of communities, and especially
the women of the area.  We need you to
help us on the way to building peace, prosperity and sustainability.</p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>We are a cooperative, built from the communities of
the Bamyan area, seeking to educate and empower ourselves.  We are a female focused organisation, that
aims to provide independent livelihoods for women that otherwise have very few
opportunities.  Our organisation consists
of 9 female trained bee-keepers, 22 female board members, and 225 female
beekeepers.</p>
<p><b>What We Do</b></p>
<p>In a
nutshell: education, equipment and coordination</p>
<p>Achieving
‘critical mass’ for such micro-industries 
requires the participants at all levels to work more closely with each
other, share information and pool resources towards achievement of collectively
understood goals with strategies that are aligned.  Problems such as swarming and disease can be
debilitating for individual beekeepers: the cooperative seeks to minimise
damage by providing assistance.  We also
seek to consolidate links with beekeepers and their markets, developing a
collaborative Business Plan, packaging and branding</p>

<br/></div>","Small Community, Big DreamsBuilding a sustainable future for communities in Afghanistan
Emerging from the Taliban governance 14 years ago, the
Bamyan area has faced many challenges in fighting poverty.  Only a small proportion of the land is
cultivatable, the rangelands have been degraded from overgrazing, and the efficiency
of the farming remains low.
Beekeeping has been identified as one of the most
promising microenterprises to eliminate poverty and empower women in Afghanistan’s
Bamyan area.  It provides cash income and
contributes to food security, as well as providing opportunities for female
economic independence in a socially acceptable way.
BEES is a micro-enterprise seeking to promote
beekeeping in the Bamyan area.  The
project has the potential to transform the lives of communities, and especially
the women of the area.  We need you to
help us on the way to building peace, prosperity and sustainability.
Who We Are
We are a cooperative, built from the communities of
the Bamyan area, seeking to educate and empower ourselves.  We are a female focused organisation, that
aims to provide independent livelihoods for women that otherwise have very few
opportunities.  Our organisation consists
of 9 female trained bee-keepers, 22 female board members, and 225 female
beekeepers.
What We Do
In a
nutshell: education, equipment and coordination
Achieving
‘critical mass’ for such micro-industries 
requires the participants at all levels to work more closely with each
other, share information and pool resources towards achievement of collectively
understood goals with strategies that are aligned.  Problems such as swarming and disease can be
debilitating for individual beekeepers: the cooperative seeks to minimise
damage by providing assistance.  We also
seek to consolidate links with beekeepers and their markets, developing a
collaborative Business Plan, packaging and branding
What We Need
& What You Get

We are seeking $9000 to fund the purchase of:

a second-hand Toyota townace model 1993 ($6500); and

essential beekeeping equipments such as smoke pump, metal hive tool, Honey extractor machine, etc. The detailed items are outlined below:

The Impact
The project has a successful track record, and

districts, 25 cooperatives, and 40 villages
·  Development of a locally appropriate beekeeping training

within communities and US$18.5 when sold by the Bamyan Beekeeping Cooperative
However, the BBES is still in its infancy, and
we need to enhance our capacity and knowledge to grow and develop.  Your contributions are essential for our
business in two ways:

The development of equipment and technology solutions increase
     output and efficiency.  There are

<h3>Who we are </h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://thepeacewithinproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace Within Project</a>'s mission is to

<h3>Our project</h3>
<p></p>
<div>The conflict
between Israel and the Palestinian people has affected the region for over 60
years.
For generations now, the Palestinian population has been exposed to
violence, and as such affected by high levels of psychological stress hampering daily
life.<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
</div>
</div><div>
<br/><p><span>In August 2015 we will provide a free training to 20 women living in the West Bank in the Palestinian Territories to become yoga teachers.</span></p>
<p>These women will in turn teach yoga in
their communities and provide a simple tool to improve the <b>wellbeing of hundreds of people in need of
inner peace</b>.</p>
<p>
In the
last few years a handful of Palestinian women have become yoga
teachers and are teaching in their communities.
However, the demand is still growing (""<i>people here are hungry for yoga</i>"" says one of the local yoga teachers) especially in schools,
villages and refugee camps. Our <a href=""http://thepeacewithinproject.com/2015/03/07/assessment-in-the-west-bank/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">assessment</a> in the West Bank last November
confirmed the growing need.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With its
well-known benefits on physical and mental health, yoga will rapidly help the Palestinians improve their daily life. Yoga will especially help people <b>cope with
the conflict's psychological impact</b>; alleviate stress, anxiety and depression;
develop inner peace and enhance their general wellbeing.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>Why the Palestinian Territories?</b></h4>
<p>We chose the Palestinian Territories as the
first location for the <a href=""http://thepeacewithinproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace Within Project</a> for its specific situation. It is a
long-term low intensity conflict; where people are exposed to ongoing violence severely affecting their mental health.
What is more, given the economic situation, options are limited in terms of physical
activity, wellbeing and psychological support</p>
<p><a href=""http://thepeacewithinproject.com/founder/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pauline</a>, the founder of the <a href=""http://thepeacewithinproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace Within Project</a>
has worked in the Palestinian Territories with <a href=""http://www.msf.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Doctors without Borders</span></a> and <a href=""http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/countries/middle-east/west-bank-gaza"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Action Against Hunger</a> on mental health
programs, witnessing first hand the psychological hardship endured by the
Palestinians.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While
there is also great need for yoga in the Gaza Strip, given the constraints -
access and security situation – we will start in the West Bank and hope to
expand into that region as the program progresses.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Does the project have a peace agenda?</b></h4>
<p></p>The training doesn't fall within a global conflict resolution framework but rather aims at helping the Palestinians to cultivate inner peace. However eventually, if yoga continues growing in the Palestinian Territories, children raised with yoga's peace culture will certainly deal with the conflict in a different manner.<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>Is Yoga a religion? Does Yoga contradict with
Islam?</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Yoga is not a religion. Yoga originated in ancient India, where several different religions were and are practiced, but yoga is not directly connected to any religion. A person from any faith can practice yoga, as can an atheist. People with faith often find that a regular practice helps them to strengthen their faith.</p>
<p>Yoga as a spiritual practice does not contradict Islam. Mirna, a Palestinian yoga teacher - Muslim and veiled - indeed sees more similarities than contradictions between yoga and Islam. The daily Muslim prayer entails a meditation-like centering and kneeling bows, echoing yogic poses. The word ""ameen"" resonates with the word ""Om"" channeling inner energy and a sense of connection.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>Why a course specifically for women?</b></h4>
<p></p>The Arab/Muslim culture limits the possibility to carry out co-ed physical activity and women have fewer opportunities to practice any form of physical exercise and stay healthy. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Furthermore women are
particularly affected by the conflict: by extension they risk being exposed to domestic violence (consequence of men's stress, distress and unemployment); they also exhibit a higher prevalence of
mental disorders than men.
Finally, women are primary relays within the communities as particularly
involved in education, health care and social work.</span>

<h3><b>Qui sommes nous</b></h3>
<p>La mission du <a href=""http://thepeacewithinproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace Within Project</a> est de former des
professeurs de yoga dans des contextes particulièrement difficiles, mettant le
yoga à la portée de populations ayant besoin de paix intérieure.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>Pourquoi cette
campagne</b></h3>
</div>
<div></div>Le conflit entre Israel et le peuple palestinien affecte la région depuis plus de 60 ans. Depuis des générations maintenant, la population palestinienne est exposée à la violence et affectée par un stress psychologique élevé, impactant la vie quotidienne.<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>En août 2015 nous allons démarrer une formation de
professeurs de yoga gratuite pour des femmes vivant en Cisjordanie dans les
Territoires Palestiniens. Une fois formées, ces femmes enseigneront à leur tour
le yoga dans leurs communautés et fourniront ainsi un outil simple permettant
d'améliorer le <b>bien-être de centaines de personnes ayant un
véritable besoin de paix intérieure.
</b><p><br/></p>
<p>Au cours des dernières années, une poignée de
palestiniennes sont devenues professeurs de yoga et enseignent aujourd'hui dans
leurs communautés. Cependant la demande continue d'augmenter notamment dans les
écoles, les villages et les camps de réfugiés. Notre évaluation sur place en
novembre dernier a confirmé le besoin croissant. </p>
<p>Avec ses bienfaits reconnus sur la santé physique et
mentale, le yoga peut rapidement aider les Palestiniens à mieux vivre le quotidien.
Le yoga peut notamment permettre <b>d'atténuer l'impact psychologique du conflit</b>; d'alléger
le stress, l'anxiété et la dépression; de développer la paix intérieure et le
bien-être général.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>L'impact</h3>
<p>En contribuant à ce projet, vous n'allez pas seulement permettre à 20
femmes d'obtenir une large compréhension et pratique du yoga mais vous allez
mettre yoga et paix intérieure à la portée de centaines de Palestiniens de
manière durable.</p>
<p>Les élèves viendront de différentes régions, formant un réseau à travers la
Cisjordanie - Naplouse, Jénine, Jérusalem Est, Béthlehem, etc. et incluront des institutrices, des infirmières, des sages-femmes et des assistantes sociales - atteignant les
<b>communautés les plus vulnérables et mal desservies</b> - camps de réfugiés,
villages bédouins, etc. Le projet bénéficiera ainsi directement aux femmes
recevant la formation et indirectement à leur communauté en général.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>Ce dont nous avons
besoin</b></h3>
<p>Sur la base de notre évaluation en Cisjordanie (Ramallah,
Naplouse, Béthlehem) en novembre 2014 nous estimons qu'ils nous faut $11,000
(€9,750)</p>
<p><b>Budget détaillé:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Transport international &amp; local
     des formatrices (5) - $3,800</li>
<li>Location de l'espace permettant
     d'accueillir formatrices et élèves - $3,000</li>
<li>Nourriture pour les formatrices et
     les élèves - $2,000</li>
<li>Interprétation anglais/arabe - $1,600</li>
<li>Impression &amp; traduction du

<h3><b>Plus de détails
sur la formation</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>Contexte</b></h4>
<p>Le conflit qui perdure entre Israël et
le peuple palestinien est particulièrement difficile pour les Palestiniens -
incursions militaires, confiscation de terres, destruction de maisons,
restriction de mouvements, etc. Depuis des générations maintenant, la
population palestinienne est exposée à la violence et affectée par un stress
psychologique élevé, impactant la vie quotidienne.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>Détails du projet</b></h4>
<p>Le cours sera spécialement conçu pour
répondre aux besoins locaux et le curriculum comprendra: Philosophie du yoga;
Méditation; Hatha Yoga; Anatomie et Physiologie; Yoga nidra et Yoga pour le
trauma; Yoga pré &amp; post natal; Yoga pour les enfants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sachant qu'une personne sur trois a moins de 14 ans dans les Territoires Palestiniens, une de nos priorités sera de former des professeurs en yoga pour les enfants. Des centaines <b>d'enfants</b> auront l'opportunité d'apprendre un outil puissant qui les aidera à se détendre, à améliorer leur concentration et à développer confiance et estime de soi. L'exposition au yoga permettra également d'introduire dès le plus jeune âge des valeurs telles de la non-violence, la gratitude et la discipline.</p>
<p>Aussi, étant donné que les palestiniennes ont en moyenne 4 enfants, former des sages femmes - en particulier au yoga prénatal &amp; postnatal - permettra d'atteindre les <b>femmes enceintes</b> et jeunes mamans à un moment privilégié de leur vie.</p>
<p>La formation aura lieu en août-septembre
2015 et durera 16 jours, incluant une retraite intensive de 10 jours et trois
weekends consécutifs. </p>
<p>L'organisatrice a participé dans plusieurs formations de professeurs - notamment la première dans une prison aux Etats-Unis- elle a également déjà travaillé dans la région<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Les autres formatrices ont été sélectionnées sur base de leur expérience et spécialité (yoga prénatal, etc.)</span></p>
<p>La formation sera gratuite pour permettre
aux femmes aux revenus inférieurs de participer.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Questions fréquentes</b></h3>
<h4><b><br/></b></h4>
<h4><b>Pourquoi les Territoires Palestiniens?</b></h4>
<p>Nous avons choisi les Territoires Palestiniens comme le
premier contexte d'intervention du <a href=""http://www.thepeacewithinproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Peace Within Project</span></a> pour sa situation
singulière. Il s'agit d'un conflit de longue durée et de faible intensité; la
population y est continuellement exposée à la violence avec un impact sévère
sur la santé mentale. Aussi, au vu de la situation économique les possibilités
en terme de sport, bien-être et soutien psychologique sont limités.</p>
<p><a href=""http://thepeacewithinproject.com/founder/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Pauline</span></a>, la fondatrice du
<span><a href=""http://www.thepeacewithinproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace Within
Project</a> </span>a travaillé dans les Territoires Palestiniens, avec <span><a href=""http://www.msf.fr/pays/territoires-palestiniens"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Médecins Sans
Frontières</a> </span>et <span><a href=""http://www.actioncontrelafaim.org/fr/content/territoire-palestinien-occupe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Action Contre la
Faim</a> </span>sur des programmes de santé mentale, observant directement
les souffrances psychologiques subies par les Palestiniens.</p>
<p>Alors que les besoins de yoga existent également - voir davantage - dans la bande de Gaza, étant donnée les contraintes - accès et
situation sécuritaire - nous commençons en Cisjordanie et espérons pouvoir développer ensuite l'activité dans cette zone.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Le projet a t-il un agenda pour la paix?</b></h4>
<p>La formation n'entre pas dans un cadre globale de
résolution de conflit mais cherche plutôt à aider les Palestiniens à cultiver
la paix intérieure et donc à mieux vivre le conflit. Cependant, si le
yoga continue de se développer dans les Territoires Palestiniens, les enfants
élevés avec la culture de paix du yoga traiteront certainement le conflit de
manière différente.</p>
<h4><b><br/></b></h4>
<h4><b>Le yoga est-il une religion? Le yoga contredit-il
l'Islam?</b></h4>
<p>Le yoga n'est pas une religion. Le yoga trouve son
origine dans l'Inde ancienne, où de multiples religions étaient et sont
aujourd'hui pratiquées, mais le yoga n'est directement connecté à aucune
religion. Une personne de n'importe quelle confession peu pratiquer le yoga, de
même qu'un athée. Les croyants trouvent souvent qu'une pratique régulière les
aide à renforcer leur foi.</p>
<p>Le yoga, pratique spirituelle ne contredit pas l'Islam.
Mirna, une professeur de yoga palestinienne - musulmane et voilée - voit d'ailleurs
davantage de similarités entre le yoga et l'Islam que de contradictions. La
prière quotidienne musulmane inclue une forme de méditation et des
prosternations faisant écho aux postures de yoga. Le mot ""ameen""
résonne avec le mot ""Om"" canalisant l'énergie intérieure et un sens
de connexion.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Pourquoi un cours spécialement pour les femmes?</b></h4>
<p>La culture arabo-musulmane limite les
possibilités de mener des activités physiques mixtes et les femmes ont moins
d'occasions de faire du sport et de garder la forme. D'autre part, les femmes
sont particulièrement affectées par le conflit: elles risquent plus souvent d'être
exposées à la violence domestique et présentent une prévalence de troubles psychiques
plus élevée que les hommes. Enfin, les femmes sont les relais prioritaires au
sein de la communauté: impliquée dans l'éducation, la santé et le travail
social. </p>

August-September 2015 and will last 16 days including a 10-day intensive
retreat and three follow-up weekends 
(equivalent to a US standard
Yoga Teachers Training certification).

The founder and lead trainer has been involved in several teachers trainings, including the first one in a US prison and has worked previously in the region.
The other trainers have been selected based on their experience and specialty (prenatal yoga, etc.)
The training will be free of charge to ensure that women from lower incomes can participate.

Frequently Asked Questions


Why the Palestinian Territories?
We chose the Palestinian Territories as the
first location for the Peace Within Project for its specific situation. It is a
long-term low intensity conflict; where people are exposed to ongoing violence severely affecting their mental health.
What is more, given the economic situation, options are limited in terms of physical
activity, wellbeing and psychological support
Pauline, the founder of the Peace Within Project
has worked in the Palestinian Territories with Doctors without Borders and Action Against Hunger on mental health
programs, witnessing first hand the psychological hardship endured by the
Palestinians.


While
there is also great need for yoga in the Gaza Strip, given the constraints -
access and security situation – we will start in the West Bank and hope to
expand into that region as the program progresses.






Does the project have a peace agenda?
The training doesn't fall within a global conflict resolution framework but rather aims at helping the Palestinians to cultivate inner peace. However eventually, if yoga continues growing in the Palestinian Territories, children raised with yoga's peace culture will certainly deal with the conflict in a different manner.
Is Yoga a religion? Does Yoga contradict with
Islam?

Yoga is not a religion. Yoga originated in ancient India, where several different religions were and are practiced, but yoga is not directly connected to any religion. A person from any faith can practice yoga, as can an atheist. People with faith often find that a regular practice helps them to strengthen their faith.
Yoga as a spiritual practice does not contradict Islam. Mirna, a Palestinian yoga teacher - Muslim and veiled - indeed sees more similarities than contradictions between yoga and Islam. The daily Muslim prayer entails a meditation-like centering and kneeling bows, echoing yogic poses. The word ""ameen"" resonates with the word ""Om"" channeling inner energy and a sense of connection.

Why a course specifically for women?
The Arab/Muslim culture limits the possibility to carry out co-ed physical activity and women have fewer opportunities to practice any form of physical exercise and stay healthy. Furthermore women are
particularly affected by the conflict: by extension they risk being exposed to domestic violence (consequence of men's stress, distress and unemployment); they also exhibit a higher prevalence of
mental disorders than men.
Finally, women are primary relays within the communities as particularly
involved in education, health care and social work.

Qui sommes nous
La mission du Peace Within Project est de former des
professeurs de yoga dans des contextes particulièrement difficiles, mettant le
yoga à la portée de populations ayant besoin de paix intérieure.



Pourquoi cette
campagne

Le conflit entre Israel et le peuple palestinien affecte la région depuis plus de 60 ans. Depuis des générations maintenant, la population palestinienne est exposée à la violence et affectée par un stress psychologique élevé, impactant la vie quotidienne.


En août 2015 nous allons démarrer une formation de
professeurs de yoga gratuite pour des femmes vivant en Cisjordanie dans les
Territoires Palestiniens. Une fois formées, ces femmes enseigneront à leur tour
le yoga dans leurs communautés et fourniront ainsi un outil simple permettant
d'améliorer le bien-être de centaines de personnes ayant un
véritable besoin de paix intérieure.

Au cours des dernières années, une poignée de
palestiniennes sont devenues professeurs de yoga et enseignent aujourd'hui dans
leurs communautés. Cependant la demande continue d'augmenter notamment dans les
écoles, les villages et les camps de réfugiés. Notre évaluation sur place en
novembre dernier a confirmé le besoin croissant. 
Avec ses bienfaits reconnus sur la santé physique et
mentale, le yoga peut rapidement aider les Palestiniens à mieux vivre le quotidien.
Le yoga peut notamment permettre d'atténuer l'impact psychologique du conflit; d'alléger
le stress, l'anxiété et la dépression; de développer la paix intérieure et le
bien-être général.

L'impact
En contribuant à ce projet, vous n'allez pas seulement permettre à 20
femmes d'obtenir une large compréhension et pratique du yoga mais vous allez
mettre yoga et paix intérieure à la portée de centaines de Palestiniens de
manière durable.
Les élèves viendront de différentes régions, formant un réseau à travers la
Cisjordanie - Naplouse, Jénine, Jérusalem Est, Béthlehem, etc. et incluront des institutrices, des infirmières, des sages-femmes et des assistantes sociales - atteignant les
communautés les plus vulnérables et mal desservies - camps de réfugiés,
villages bédouins, etc. Le projet bénéficiera ainsi directement aux femmes
recevant la formation et indirectement à leur communauté en général.

Ce dont nous avons
besoin
Sur la base de notre évaluation en Cisjordanie (Ramallah,
Naplouse, Béthlehem) en novembre 2014 nous estimons qu'ils nous faut $11,000
(€9,750)
Budget détaillé:

Transport international & local
     des formatrices (5) - $3,800
Location de l'espace permettant
     d'accueillir formatrices et élèves - $3,000
Nourriture pour les formatrices et
     les élèves - $2,000
Interprétation anglais/arabe - $1,600
Impression & traduction du
     matériel pédagogiques en arabe - $300
Achat de tapis de yoga - $300




Ce que vous
obtiendrez
Vous ferez partie
d'une communauté innovante contribuant à répandre l'enseignement du yoga et
aidant des centaines de personnes à trouver bonheur et paix intérieure dans une
région en proie aux troubles.

ce projet sans vous!

Plus de détails
sur la formation


Contexte
Le conflit qui perdure entre Israël et
le peuple palestinien est particulièrement difficile pour les Palestiniens -
incursions militaires, confiscation de terres, destruction de maisons,
restriction de mouvements, etc. Depuis des générations maintenant, la
population palestinienne est exposée à la violence et affectée par un stress
psychologique élevé, impactant la vie quotidienne.

Détails du projet
Le cours sera spécialement conçu pour
répondre aux besoins locaux et le curriculum comprendra: Philosophie du yoga;
Méditation; Hatha Yoga; Anatomie et Physiologie; Yoga nidra et Yoga pour le
trauma; Yoga pré & post natal; Yoga pour les enfants.

Sachant qu'une personne sur trois a moins de 14 ans dans les Territoires Palestiniens, une de nos priorités sera de former des professeurs en yoga pour les enfants. Des centaines d'enfants auront l'opportunité d'apprendre un outil puissant qui les aidera à se détendre, à améliorer leur concentration et à développer confiance et estime de soi. L'exposition au yoga permettra également d'introduire dès le plus jeune âge des valeurs telles de la non-violence, la gratitude et la discipline.
Aussi, étant donné que les palestiniennes ont en moyenne 4 enfants, former des sages femmes - en particulier au yoga prénatal & postnatal - permettra d'atteindre les femmes enceintes et jeunes mamans à un moment privilégié de leur vie.
La formation aura lieu en août-septembre
2015 et durera 16 jours, incluant une retraite intensive de 10 jours et trois
weekends consécutifs. 
L'organisatrice a participé dans plusieurs formations de professeurs - notamment la première dans une prison aux Etats-Unis- elle a également déjà travaillé dans la région. Les autres formatrices ont été sélectionnées sur base de leur expérience et spécialité (yoga prénatal, etc.)
La formation sera gratuite pour permettre
aux femmes aux revenus inférieurs de participer.


Questions fréquentes

Pourquoi les Territoires Palestiniens?
Nous avons choisi les Territoires Palestiniens comme le
premier contexte d'intervention du Peace Within Project pour sa situation
singulière. Il s'agit d'un conflit de longue durée et de faible intensité; la
population y est continuellement exposée à la violence avec un impact sévère
sur la santé mentale. Aussi, au vu de la situation économique les possibilités
en terme de sport, bien-être et soutien psychologique sont limités.
Pauline, la fondatrice du
Peace Within
Project a travaillé dans les Territoires Palestiniens, avec Médecins Sans
Frontières et Action Contre la
Faim sur des programmes de santé mentale, observant directement
les souffrances psychologiques subies par les Palestiniens.
Alors que les besoins de yoga existent également - voir davantage - dans la bande de Gaza, étant donnée les contraintes - accès et
situation sécuritaire - nous commençons en Cisjordanie et espérons pouvoir développer ensuite l'activité dans cette zone.

Le projet a t-il un agenda pour la paix?
La formation n'entre pas dans un cadre globale de
résolution de conflit mais cherche plutôt à aider les Palestiniens à cultiver
la paix intérieure et donc à mieux vivre le conflit. Cependant, si le
yoga continue de se développer dans les Territoires Palestiniens, les enfants
élevés avec la culture de paix du yoga traiteront certainement le conflit de
manière différente.

Le yoga est-il une religion? Le yoga contredit-il
l'Islam?
Le yoga n'est pas une religion. Le yoga trouve son
origine dans l'Inde ancienne, où de multiples religions étaient et sont
aujourd'hui pratiquées, mais le yoga n'est directement connecté à aucune
religion. Une personne de n'importe quelle confession peu pratiquer le yoga, de
même qu'un athée. Les croyants trouvent souvent qu'une pratique régulière les
aide à renforcer leur foi.
Le yoga, pratique spirituelle ne contredit pas l'Islam.
Mirna, une professeur de yoga palestinienne - musulmane et voilée - voit d'ailleurs
davantage de similarités entre le yoga et l'Islam que de contradictions. La
prière quotidienne musulmane inclue une forme de méditation et des
prosternations faisant écho aux postures de yoga. Le mot ""ameen""
résonne avec le mot ""Om"" canalisant l'énergie intérieure et un sens
de connexion.

Pourquoi un cours spécialement pour les femmes?
La culture arabo-musulmane limite les
possibilités de mener des activités physiques mixtes et les femmes ont moins
d'occasions de faire du sport et de garder la forme. D'autre part, les femmes
sont particulièrement affectées par le conflit: elles risquent plus souvent d'être
exposées à la violence domestique et présentent une prévalence de troubles psychiques
plus élevée que les hommes. Enfin, les femmes sont les relais prioritaires au
sein de la communauté: impliquée dans l'éducation, la santé et le travail
social.

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm Sean, Uncle Frogface to some. I used to be a performer and teacher. In 2009 I had a serious motorbike accident that changed my life forever. After months of physiotherapy I had almost recovered, however I soon started to decline health-wise. I was getting chronic pain and started to lose the use of both of my legs. I had to stop working when I started using a wheelchair and since then have been trying to get a firm diagnosis. I now have that. as a result of brain injury from the accident I have a condition called FND (functional neurological disorder) which means that even with intense physiotherapy, I'll only ever get back to short spats of walking with a cane. </p>
<p>I haven't let that get me down though. And that's not really what this is about. I remain positive, and I'd like to get back to some sort of work. Now I can't get back to my former work, but I am an artist. I paint, sculpt, design, craft... if its creative, I love it. With your help I could start producing work to sell on a larger scale. I could set myself up as a professional artist rather than a semi-professional. by donating, you are helping an artist to work at his full potential regardless of challenges. I hope one day to work with an arts academy to show that disabled artists are still artists, and that art can help people in so many ways.</p>

We offer the whole shebang: graphic design, offset and digital printing and mailing services. With a team of awesomely rad and experienced designers, we can provide you with the top-notch quality design typically reserved for those who invest in costly design studios. Print is not dead! Now more than ever, we long for a tactile experience in this digital age. 



 When we launched Simply Print on Tuesday, July 21st, 2015, we had planned to slowly ease into the business. Do it the right way, gather up the money, find an office space, purchase new computers and upgrade our software. Circumstances had forced our hand, causing us to launch a month ahead of schedule. It didn't seem like a big deal at the time, but after the first day it quickly became apparent that our services were in high demand (we aren't complaining). We had hit the ground running without even realizing it. 
We gathered together with our laptops in Megan's spare room, and set off on our adventure. After our first week running, we have emptied our bank accounts and maxed out our credit cards, and decided it is time to finally finish and launch that IndieGoGo campaign we had started.

   
 Your contributions will not only help us with all the start up costs needed to get our company the kick start it needs, but it will also allow our husbands, family and friends to sleep better at night. Have you tried sleeping next to someone who tosses and turns all night? Yeah, not fun.
Besides happy husbands, your funding will go towards helping us with the following:  
New Computers: Megan has a desktop that is older than a kindergartner, Tammy and Aleksandra have laptops that have seen better days, and all three computers are hanging on for their dear life.  
Upgraded Software: The only thing almost as important as a new computer is updated software. Adobe InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator to be exact. 
Office Supplies: We need printers, paper, trash cans, boxes, and shipping supplies. Seriously, you can only reuse a paper bag from Target so many times.

Design Essentials: Our clients deserve a bit more than fonts downloaded for free from DaFont.com and images downloaded from Google image search. Your funding will go towards expanding our font library and purchasing a subscription to a stock image website.

Printing Costs: Until we are able to establish credit with our vendors, most of them require payment up front or upon delivery. We don't want to make all of our clients pay that way, so your funding will help fill in the gap between paying our vendors, and giving our clients time to get together money to pay us. 


The Boring Stuff: Permits, licenses and numbers all cost money. We don't like doing things that are illegal (if we do, it has to be fun), and have no plans of our lives being like an episode of Orange is the New Black, so funding will go towards making sure that we are staying in line. Some of these items were already purchased using our own money, so you'd be helping to pay us back.








*Final design for products are still pending.

  We are looking to raise $50,000 to purchase tablets (or Chromebooks), including a WiFi hotspot to give seniors access to the web.  If you want to get personal with your contribution, purchase a tablet to give to a senior citizen, who has never owned an electronic device before.  If we don't reach our goal, then we will buy as many devices as we can to get seniors connected to the web!

   Help Improve the Health of Senior Citizens
  Let's get the lost generation connected to the their loved-ones and beyond! Contributing to this project is the first step in helping us bring more advanced technology to independent and assisted living homes and more, that seniors can interact with to improve their health and lifestyle. While working with the basics with a generation that has no knowledge of how the web works, we will be exploring ways to automate health care that allows medical professionals to monitor vital signs in real team.  


Help Improve their Computer Skills

The 65+ age group are the easier targets because they lack the most computer skills and internet skill. They are also trust strangers more, so are more opt to fall victim of an internet scam.
We have been working on this project for about two years and we have been able to successfully introduce what the web has to offer and give lessons about important topics such as phishing e-mails, viruses and malware, social media and staying connected with loved-ones. 


   Risks & Challenges 
When it comes to health care, there are many regulations in place that may now allow to produce a system that is for the benefit of others. We will work with regulators and physicians to develop a way keeping real time health data available. 
It all starts with the user. In order for us to understand how seniors interact with technology, we first need to get them to use it. Some seniors simply do not want anything to do with technology, so we have to help break that negative perception.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Buffalo Bore has begun getting requests to fill contract and high volume orders that we cannot currently handle for the lack of high-volume production machinery. 
We can easily qualify for big-bank loans to acquire this machinery but, we would rather give the perks to the INDIEGOGO crowdfunding public than to banks who, in our opinion, already get too many perks and control too much of our nation's  and world's business.   
We see  INDIEGOGO as the PERFECT vehicle for this funding effort and we touch on these points in more detail in our introductory video above so, if you have not seen it; take a look and see Buffalo Bore like it has never been revealed before.  Buffalo Bore began about 17 years ago in Salmon, Idaho.  We worked hard and earned our good name in high-performance products and are now well known in the industry which distinction is creating new kinds of opportunities. Last year Buffalo Bore was approved for exports into Canada which has opened the global market to us.  In order to meet the demands stemming from these new opportunities, we must expand.
   We Must Expand to Meet New Demands We want to offer the Perks, normally taken by banks in the form of interest, to go to the INDIEGOGO Crowdfunders instead.  In order to fill the high volume contract orders we are being asked to fill, we need several pieces of expensive production machinery which we show and explain in the video.  These new machines, with the custom tooling and dies that fit our highly specialized type of production requirements, will cost us about $750,000.  We would like to give the INDIEGOGO crowdfunding public a chance to fund us and be the beneficiaries of the perks instead of the banks. Even if we are not able to meet our $750,000 goal, we will gladly keep our perk commitments to all who contribute and we will do so with great gratitude.    If We Are Able to Reach Our Goal You, the funder will have played a key part in expanding a US business in a time when our country is losing so much industry to foreign entities and did we mention that because of you, it will have been done without a loan from a big bank.  Personal, Local & National Preparedness is a very big part of what we are about and a successful expansion will only make us more proficient and able. We have earned our reputation in the high performance products we make and the same ingenuity that went into the products that gained us recognition, will go into our higher production machinery so that we can offer our high-quality, high-performance products to a broader customer base. Truth is, with you, we will grow much faster than without you.  Wouldn't it be nice if down the road you could say; ""I helped fund that company.""
    Unlike New Startups, We Can & Will Deliver On Our Perks  We know that the banks will loan expansion money to us, with interest of course but, we highly prefer to fill our perk commitments to the INDIEGOGO crowdfunders instead!  About the only hurdles we foresee in meeting our perk commitments are filling large web orders immediately.  If this campaign goes super well, we may need a little bit of time to get some of the really big perks filled. The nice thing is though; if the campaign goes well, we will have high volume production machinery in place to fill our big perk commitments more quickly!

With your help, we can raise $15,000 to fund a teacher-training program for two aspiring yoga teachers and myself. We will then travel to India and learn classical hatha yoga attaining the privilege and fulfillment to bringing this ancient science of complete well-being to more people.Basic Overview -Hello my name is Kashish Sarup! I’m an aspiring yoga teacher who spent her life growing up in India where yoga is a big part of the culture. After moving to the United States I went to various yoga studios and experienced all sorts of yoga. Much of the yoga I experienced here in the United States was different from what I had experienced in India. After encountering various distortions and seeing how yoga is largely limited to just the physical aspect of you who are, I have been inspired to go back to India for a teacher training program in Classical Hatha Yoga.  Along with me, two other aspiring yoga teachers will be traveling to India for an 8 month teacher training program. After completion we will come back to the San Francisco bay area and start our first yoga studio together.  After seeing yoga take on several changes, some which even have a harmful impact on ones system, my goal is to bring back hatha yoga in its most authentic form to America so one can experience life in a more profound and inclusive way.More about Classical Hatha  Yoga - An asana is a posture. There are innumerable postures your body can take. Among these, certain postures have been identified as yogasanas. Yoga means that which takes you on to a higher dimension or higher perception of life. So, that kind of posture which leads you to a higher possibility is called a “yogasana.” The science of asanas is known as hatha yoga. “Ha” means sun, “ta” means moon. The first process of yoga is to bring balance between the masculine and feminine in you, without cultivating these two dimensions within us, there is no reaching towards the peak, there is no question of a human being flowering to his fullest possibility.Right now, when you are trying to do hatha yoga, the biggest barrier is the limitations of your body. In fact, whatever human beings want to do, the biggest barrier is their body and mind. What should have been a stepping stone has turned into an obstacle, simply because they have not explored it considerably. After a profound and thorough exploration of the human system, the yogic system identified 84 asanas as yogasanas, 84 postures through which you can transform your body and mind into a great possibility for your ultimate wellbeing. Most other spiritual processes talk about putting down the body because the body is an obstacle. If you want to sit and meditate, your legs tell you, “I need to stretch. I need to walk.” When we ask you in the morning to stretch your body, you say, “No, I want to rest.” If you do an asana and we ask you to stretch, you say, “No, I don’t want to stretch.” But if we ask you to sit unmoving, your body wants to stretch. Likewise, it has to eat, it has to sleep, it has to relieve itself – the body needs so many things. By practicing classical hatha yoga, one will be able to touch the core of who they are. Once this happens, the body and mind will work to their full potential, making things like success, health, inner peace, and good relationships come naturally.  The most important thing for people who are seeking to be successful – whether in the corporate sector, in politics, in the military, or any other field – is balance. Only if you have a balance that is not disturbed by external situations, are you capable of making use of the competence and intelligence within you. Otherwise, even the most wonderful qualities that one may have will go waste, simply because of lack of balance. Hatha yoga brings this balance.Where exactly is your money going? Your money will go to the classical Hatha Yoga teacher training program for myself and two other aspiring teachers. The School fees include 1750 hours of training ($5000 per student), accommodation, meals, training material, practice material, and post-training support.If we exceed our goal, our money will be going to our start up costs for our first yoga studio in the San Francisco Bay area. How you and the community can benefit - Your physical health, your psychological wellbeing, and your spiritual possibility depend on how well aligned you are with existence. Essentially, Hatha yoga is a step towards establishing this alignment.” –SadhguruIn addition to the innumerable physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual benefits of hatha yoga, we will be offering various perks for your help. These perks include t-shirts, meditation music to help you relax, e-books related to yoga and the inner-nature, and free hatha yoga classes once we return to the United States from our training program.How you can be involved –- Keep checking our page for updates- Share our campaign through Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter- Spread the word in person, on the phone, or through emails.- Stay involved; we want you to be a part of bringing classical hatha yoga to  America.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

				The United Church of Bacon is a real, legal church based in Las Vegas, Nevada with over 12,000 members worldwide that was founded during a meeting at Penn Jillette's house in 2010 to fight discrimination against atheists. The official launch of the church was at <a href=""http://amazingmeeting.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Amaz!ng Meeting</a>, in 2012. They believe in practical atheism and ignore the existence of gods and chose a funny bacon name with an argument that bacon is demonstrably real whereas god is imperceptible by the eye. <br/>
<br/>
				The United Church of Bacon opposes special privileges to religions on the grounds that religious people are somehow superior to inferior people for having strange beliefs, and promotes separation of church and state, science education and critical thinking, and an end to discrimination against atheists.

				The home is Penn Jillette's former retreat, called The Slammer. The brightly colored house is architecturally unique. It has been featured on over a dozen television shows and it has <b>won three local American Institute of Architects awards</b>. It's set on 8.5 acres in Las Vegas 15 minutes from the strip.</p>

			 </p></div>","THIS IS WHY ATHEISTS AND SKEPTICS NEED A COMMUNITY CENTER


United Church of Bacon wants to save Magician Penn Jillette's former home.......The Slammer ......and create The Nevatican!
			The world's largest Skeptic and Atheist Community Center. 



			 

			Penn is the vocal half of the Las Vegas magic act Penn & Teller.

			For twenty years The Slammer has been a retreat of reason in the desert and we want to keep it that way.

			Penn has moved to a new family-friendly home in the suburbs, and we plan to keep developers from buying this historic and unique place just to knock it down to make room for cookie cutter houses. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!



NOT ON OUR WATCH!



			We have been working tirelessly to find a buyer for the land who will not use the surrounding area to create a suburban abomination.





WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THAT GOAL!

				Penn has made a very generous offer to allow the United Church of Bacon
to buy The Slammer for less than the developers would pay....in fact he will allow us to only pay for operating costs, needed repairs, and improvements until we get established!!!!







THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!


				We need 3 million dollars to buy, remodel, and maintain The Slammer, but we have set the fundraising goal at $500,000. 500 grand is the minimum we need to just maintain the property. The amount we raise will be the deciding factor so donors have the final word on whether we merely maintain or own.
 

We need your help to raise the funds required to purchase, remodel, and manage the property so that we can do something good for the atheist and skeptic communities.

WATCH AN INTERVIEW WITH PENN


			You now have the chance to help do something amazing. You can help transform The Slammer into  the world's largest atheist community center,  The Nevatican.

<p>This bookstore, formerly Tomes, has rolling bookshelves which can be moved aside to create seating space for an audience of up to 80, a comfortable cabaret setting, or even a good sized dance floor. A sturdy and elevated 16' x 8' stage will be built. Rolling panels, upon which local artists can hang their works, will double as an attractive proscenium behind which the shelves and tables can be concealed to offer a more classic backdrop to events for your enjoyment.</p>

Sunday, July 12th ~ A cool and
overcast day of hiking in the Donner Pass area, the sweet scent of pine and
forest duff wafting strong as vistas of granite peaks opened up at seemingly
each turn.In that
rich mountain air I was breathing in plentiful gratitude. As this campaign
winds down with two days left, it is apparent that we will not make our “goal”.
And yet that is such a misconception!I am
grateful for the many who have donated here but also for those who have
contributed outside of this campaign. Like my grandchildren in the above photo,
I am leaping for joy because we WILL have the materials to build our stage and
to put beautiful curtains behind it. We will have the volunteer labor to
reconfigure the layout of this bookstore. And we will come close to fulfilling the
vision originally set forth here.
And that’s
not to say that more contributions would not be appreciated! Of course they would
be! But the success of this campaign is in its participation from so many. 
To Love and
Be Loved is my soul’s desire, and that feels fulfilled by you all! Thank You So
Much!  


What Every Community Needs!
Is it a bookstore? A meeting hall? A cafe? A dance house? A performance center? Yes! You are invited to come by and read, converse, buy, sing, play, dance, recite, sip fine coffees and other beverages and ... be together.  The telling and sharing, the singing and acting, the dreaming up of stories and strategies and ideas -- that's what this campaign is all about. It's a community hub!
Hi! My name is Nory Fussell and I'm stoked to be here at The Open Book! 


Music heals! Art heals! Versatility heals!
The Open Book, a quality used book store, will also be an intimate and affordable community-oriented performance hall like no other in the area. You will enjoy a wide variety of events, many of which will be offered by donation. Events such as:


a monthly Travelogue Night hosted by your traveling Nevada County neighbors
open mics at which you can play for, listen to and be heard by your community 
Learning Lunches offered by talented folks with something special to teach
a seasonal Council of Elders for learning from our treasured Wise Ones
a monthly concert to benefit Hospitality House, the local homeless shelter 
many other activities, town hall meetings, rallies ... you name it, you can host it!


This bookstore, formerly Tomes, has rolling bookshelves which can be moved aside to create seating space for an audience of up to 80, a comfortable cabaret setting, or even a good sized dance floor. A sturdy and elevated 16' x 8' stage will be built. Rolling panels, upon which local artists can hang their works, will double as an attractive proscenium behind which the shelves and tables can be concealed to offer a more classic backdrop to events for your enjoyment.
In order to make way for an abundant new inventory of fresh books, The Open Book will be ""compressed"", creating a more open feel and freeing up space for more retail sales in the adjoining coffee shop, Sierra Mountain Coffee Roasters. With books in the cafe and cafe tables in the bookstore, this has been, and will continue to be, a very successful symbiotic relationship.

In the meanwhile, the weather became better in the Netherlands so I was able to talk with her again about everything we were facing in our day to day life.

<li>3.  Transporting frames with bees!  As summer progressed and we had beekeeping to do, we had lots of frame moving that had to be done between hives.  Sometimes, simple moving, sometimes more stressful searching for queens.  Worrying about losing Her Royal Highness out the bottom of a box, or out the top while we're looking away.  We figured ""the box"" could have a screen top for use during that kind of field work as well. </li>

Product:
The Hive Butler is a clear, food-grade storage dream-come-true for beekeepers to use bringing in honey frames, storing newly built frames and even for short-term moving of bees on the frame!  There are two different lid designs: a solid lid for storage and moving, and a screen-top for use with live bees.   The Hive Butler is designed to hold 10 deep frames.  Obviously, it can hold mediums or shallows, as needed.

This early engineer's rendering  doesn't show that the Hive Butler will be clear, so you can tell whether it is loaded or ready to go.


The Problem:
Beekeepers have been working shorthanded for too long!  Bringing in honey is hot, messy, and dirty.  It doesn't have to be all of those, except maybe the hot part.  As we started pulling those absolutely beautiful frames from our hives, we didn't really know how to protect them to get them home.  Most beekeepers just pull the wooden ""super.""  Early on, we did that.  The problems? Finding spare supers.  If we did find one, wood ware is dirty, heavy, painted, and there is NO BOTTOM in those boxes! The frames can actually fall out the bottom while you carry them.  Damage, grass, filth and LEAKAGE!  In the car, on the counter, everywhere.  If you can't extract immediately, then what?  Ants, mess, loss.  The need for a better box became very evident.  
That awful leaning means damage and loss.
                                       
Coolers are very little help. Nothing holds the frames. Lost honey fills the bottom.
We had spent a lot of money  getting our bee yards established, and so every tablespoon of honey spilling anywhere was a leak from our wallets, so to speak.  So, we started using coolers.  That helped, some.  We were able to keep the bees out, and the mess contained.  But once the honey was laying in the bottom of the cooler, it was lost to us.  Can't sell it.  Can't really eat it.   And every time we moved the coolers in the yards, the frames would fall on one another, and gouge open, spilling our ""money"" into the cooler.   We would look at each other, and say, ""There needs to be a box just for this.""  Every clunk we heard in the cooler was a smack on the head to come up with a better design.  When we found ourselves saying, ""There should be a box for this,"" ten times in a day, we just decided we would be the ones to do it!



Oh no! Lost honey!  What a mess, and what happens to that gold on the bottom?

</p><p>
</p><p>Each month we deliver to your door, a bag of coffee and tasty

<p><b>Why BeanTribe?</b></p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>Africa grows some of the finest
coffee and chocolate in the world but the majority of the produce is exported
out of the continent as raw beans. Most of the production, packaging and
roasting takes place elsewhere.</p>
<p>So when you and I typically drink
coffee or enjoy a chocolate bar we help support just one job in an African
community – that of the farmer.</p>
<p>With BeanTribe we sell coffee
and chocolate that is grown and produced in Africa. This means we can support a
multitude of jobs in developing communities: supporting local farmers, coffee
roasters, chocolate makers, handlers, packers, drivers and entrepreneurs who
can in turn help their families to thrive.</p>
<p>It's trade not aid with over 3 times the impact of fair
trade.</p>

</div></div>","ORDER GIFTS OF COFFEE & CHOCOLATE BY 20TH DEC 2015 AND WE'LL MAKE SURE PARCELS ARE DELIVERED BY CHRISTMAS EVE!!! (free delivery anywhere in Ireland)About BeanTribe:BeanTribe is a new subscription service for coffee and chocolate from communities in Africa.


Each month we deliver to your door, a bag of coffee and tasty
bar of chocolate from different communities in Africa. It's trade not aid
with over 3 times the impact of fair trade.
Why BeanTribe?
Africa grows some of the finest
coffee and chocolate in the world but the majority of the produce is exported
out of the continent as raw beans. Most of the production, packaging and
roasting takes place elsewhere.
So when you and I typically drink
coffee or enjoy a chocolate bar we help support just one job in an African
community – that of the farmer.
With BeanTribe we sell coffee
and chocolate that is grown and produced in Africa. This means we can support a
multitude of jobs in developing communities: supporting local farmers, coffee
roasters, chocolate makers, handlers, packers, drivers and entrepreneurs who
can in turn help their families to thrive.
It's trade not aid with over 3 times the impact of fair
trade.
Your Support:With your help we aim to raise the seed funding to launch BeanTribe and fulfil our first customer orders. Your funds can help us:



Order the first batches of chocolate and
coffee from producers in Africa
build version 1.0 of the BeanTribe.com online
store
perfect the design packaging & branding
establish the delivery process from
producers in Africa to the customer.
Share the stories of the producers in Africa and
BeanTribe’s impact. 

What we Need:
Our goal with this campaign is to raise €12,000 and secure 100 subscriptions for coffee and chocolate for 2016. 



What You Get:
In return for your support, you will receive: 



monthly deliveries of great coffee and tasty chocolate

Your Impact:




Your support will get us started. It will help us create a tribe of coffee and chocolate fans and allow us to purchase the first shipments of coffee and chocolate that is  grown and made in Africa while helping sustain jobs in some  of the poorest communities on the continent.



Risks and Challenges:

This is a start up company, a new project with some healthy challenges:


We don’t know yet how large demand for BeanTribe might be - to figure this out we just need to out there selling!. 

Sourcing and establishing long term partnerships with quality coffee and chocolate producers across Africa will be crucial to our success

<p>On any given night, over 11,000 individuals are experiencing homelessness in North Carolina. Approximately 40% of those individuals are also experiencing a serious mental illness.</p>
<p>As high as these numbers are, they only represent that fraction of the population that meet HUD criteria for “literally homeless” and only document a mental illness if the individual is currently receiving services. The statistics do not include those individuals who are not receiving treatment, are living in unidentifiable locations, or are not homeless, but are living in unsafe and substandard dwellings and are often at high risk for becoming homeless. </p>
<p>The statistics do not reflect the number of individuals with disabilities who are living off of Supplemental Security Income, do not have a housing voucher, and face the reality of possible homelessness everyday. </p>
<p>In North Carolina, 146,804 individuals with disabilities receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The average SSI for an individual with a disability is $721 a month. To rent a one-bedroom studio apartment in this state at the average fair market rate would cost an individual over 102% of their income. </p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Collaborative, in a recent report on the housing crisis for individuals with disabilities stated “in 2014, it was impossible for a single adult anywhere in the country receiving SSI to obtain decent and safe housing in the community unless they had some type of permanent rental subsidy.” This is a crisis that deprives hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities of a basic human need: A place of their own to call home.</p>
<p>For individuals who are experiencing mental illness, housing insecurity not only deprives them of shelter from the elements, it imposes an extraordinary hurdle to the rehabilitative process. Homelessness exacerbates illness, and creates a psychological environment in which recovery, in any form, is next to impossible.</p>
<p>Which is why, at Penny Lane, we view housing as healthcare. </p>
<p>Our vision at the Farm is to assist individuals living with mental health challenges to find a way to become self-sufficient and have an improved quality of life. One of the ways we can do that is to offer a housing solution that is affordable, energy efficient, and located in a supportive community environment. A tiny home community on the Penny Lane campus offers a practical solution to the life of chronic homelessness and isolation experienced by many individuals with mental illness.</p>
<p>Tiny homes can be defined as homes that do not exceed 500 square feet. They are far less expensive than traditional homes in terms of taxes, building, heating, maintenance, and repair costs. Living in a tiny home also encourages a less cluttered and simpler lifestyle and minimizes ecological impacts.</p>
<p>The Tiny Home Community project at Penny Lane is designed to evolve over three phases of development. Phase I is a pilot home on the campus that will serve as a research site for internally selected clients to experience living in a small space for a brief period of time. We hope to develop an understanding of the benefits and the challenges that living within 336 square feet may pose for potential residents. The data collected from this project will be used to inform Phase II, which is the development of a community of five tiny homes on the Penny Lane Campus. </p>
<p>At this time, the focus of the research will shift from studying the viability of living in a small space, to that of living in an intentional community. Data collected from Phase II will inform the development of our third phase, the building of a final cluster of five tiny homes on the Penny Lane campus.</p>
<p>This project, which was only a concept last March, has captured the interest and support of a number of like-minded organizations in Chatham County. Together, we formed the Tiny House Community Collaborative and the construction of our first house, our pilot tiny home, began at the Chatham County Fair on September 8. We expect to welcome our first research participant into the home in March of 2016. </p>
<p>The house itself is 336 square feet, and is a passive active solar house. It has a bedroom, a living room with a propane fireplace, a kitchenette complete with a stove, refrigerator and kitchen sink, and a bathroom with a toilet, shower, and combination washer/dryer. The cost of this home to the resident will be $250/month, and that includes all basic utilities.</p>
<p>Individuals who donate to this campaign will be helping to outfit the home with furniture and appliances that have been recommended by a team at the UNC School of Occupational Sciences. Seventy-five percent of the funds raised will be used to purchase and install flooring, energy efficient appliances, furniture, and cabinetry. Remaining funds will be used to cover Kickstarter fees, donor gifts, and consultant wages.</p>
<p>This campaign is an opportunity for individuals to be a part of an effort to create a better community for North Carolina's most vulnerable citizens. It allows donors to contribute to an innovative, collaborative project that supports the growth of our society and builds connection to the loved ones in our lives who are experiencing adversity due to mental illness. </p>
<p>At Penny Lane, we embrace the idea of community as the primary therapeutic factor that provides resolution to social isolation; and supportive housing as the solid foundation from which meaningful recovery can begin. The addition of fresh food, purposeful work opportunities, and access to therapeutic services make this model one that we believe will have a life changing impact for individuals diagnosed with mental illness, and become a model that can be replicated across the country and around the world.</p>

</ul>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
Our hope in this campaign is not only to raise funds to complete the first phase of our project, but also to obtain support and generate awareness
about mental illness. What we are asking you to consider is
more than just four walls and a roof. We are asking you to consider the concept
of <i>community</i>. A concept that could
alter the personal narratives of the most vulnerable members of our community, individuals
who are our friends, our mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, our daughters, and
our sons. </span><br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>Tiny homes are relatively new to the residential housing landscape. As such, there are discrepancies among county planning departments with regards to permitting and zoning. Fortunately, in Chatham County, the environmental planning department recognizes the value and potential impact of the Tiny Home project and has committed to working with us to strategize and develop solutions to any barriers that we may experience as we grow our community. We have participated in pre-application meetings, have given tours and discussed our project at length with all five of the Chatham County Commissioners, we participate in community events with our neighboring housing developments, and engage in conversations with surrounding counties to keep ourselves aware of progressions and challenges experienced in our region. We understand that we have a lot of work to do to, but feel very fortunate to have the support of our local municipalities. </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute financially, and we get that!

We expect to welcome our first research participant into the home in March of 2016. 
The house itself is 336 square feet, and is a passive active solar house. It has a bedroom, a living room with a propane fireplace, a kitchenette complete with a stove, refrigerator and kitchen sink, and a bathroom with a toilet, shower, and combination washer/dryer. The cost of this home to the resident will be $250/month, and that includes all basic utilities.
Individuals who donate to this campaign will be helping to outfit the home with furniture and appliances that have been recommended by a team at the UNC School of Occupational Sciences. Seventy-five percent of the funds raised will be used to purchase and install flooring, energy efficient appliances, furniture, and cabinetry. Remaining funds will be used to cover Kickstarter fees, donor gifts, and consultant wages.
This campaign is an opportunity for individuals to be a part of an effort to create a better community for North Carolina's most vulnerable citizens. It allows donors to contribute to an innovative, collaborative project that supports the growth of our society and builds connection to the loved ones in our lives who are experiencing adversity due to mental illness. 
At Penny Lane, we embrace the idea of community as the primary therapeutic factor that provides resolution to social isolation; and supportive housing as the solid foundation from which meaningful recovery can begin. The addition of fresh food, purposeful work opportunities, and access to therapeutic services make this model one that we believe will have a life changing impact for individuals diagnosed with mental illness, and become a model that can be replicated across the country and around the world.
Who wouldn't want to be a part of that?
   What We Need & What You Get Funds raised in this campaign will be used to purchase


flooring and cabinetry ($3,000)
bathroom equipment and accessories ($1,500)
furniture ($5,000)
an energy efficient refrigerator and washer/dryer ($3,000)
induction range ($2,000)
front porch building materials and construction fees ($5,000)
development fees ($1,500)
additional proceeds will be used to fund the building of new homes in the tiny house community 

    The Impact Understanding the Affordability Gap


Approximately 40,000 people with mental illness reside in state mental institutions
over 200,000 non-elderly people with disabilities reside in nursing homes
over 863,000 individuals with disabilities live with care givers who are over 60 years old
many adults with disabilities are forced to choose between homelessness or being placed in a restrictive institutional setting


Our hope in this campaign is not only to raise funds to complete the first phase of our project, but also to obtain support and generate awareness
about mental illness. What we are asking you to consider is
more than just four walls and a roof. We are asking you to consider the concept
of community. A concept that could
alter the personal narratives of the most vulnerable members of our community, individuals
who are our friends, our mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, our daughters, and
our sons.     Risks & Challenges  Tiny homes are relatively new to the residential housing landscape. As such, there are discrepancies among county planning departments with regards to permitting and zoning. Fortunately, in Chatham County, the environmental planning department recognizes the value and potential impact of the Tiny Home project and has committed to working with us to strategize and develop solutions to any barriers that we may experience as we grow our community. We have participated in pre-application meetings, have given tours and discussed our project at length with all five of the Chatham County Commissioners, we participate in community events with our neighboring housing developments, and engage in conversations with surrounding counties to keep ourselves aware of progressions and challenges experienced in our region. We understand that we have a lot of work to do to, but feel very fortunate to have the support of our local municipalities.

<b>Project zenpype</b><br/>  Zenpype is a small gadget/grinder that transforms any plastic bottle to a water pipe also known as shisa.

<h3>Past</h3>
<p>My name is Jacqui and I'm the owner of Strawberry Blonde Bakery. After becoming vegan 12 years ago, I was disappointed by the lack of selection of vegan pastries available. Determined to stay vegan, but not give up on treats, I started baking myself. I absolutely loved converting traditional recipes into my own creations (especially the eating part!). I decided I wanted to turn this into a career and open my own vegan bakery to fill the void and share my delicious creations. But opening a business is no small feat and I knew that if I was going to do this, I was going to have to do it right. So I enrolled in George Brown College's Baking &amp; Pastry Arts Management Program. Upon graduation I moved to Ottawa and started doing market stands. It was here that I really listened to all my customers and learned about the growing number of allergies and how often if a person had one allergy, they had multiple allergies. Being vegan for a number of years, I knew what it was like to go somewhere and not have a dessert option at all, or if there was, it was something sad looking or some old piece of fruit. I decided to eliminate gluten and nuts from my baking as well to ensure I could include as many people as possible on this journey of delicious, inclusive treats.</p>
<p>6 years ago I launched Strawberry Blonde Bakery, which was (still is and always will be) 100% vegan, gluten-free, nut &amp; peanut free. The original focus was baking for wholesale clients such as health food stores and cafes. However, there was soon a growing demand from customers who tried our treats but wanted to purchase custom birthday cakes or sugar cookies from us. We decided to find a bigger kitchen where we could bake more, but also have a small space for customers to pick up their custom orders. That's when we found our current space on Grange Ave in the Wellington West neighbourhood of Ottawa. But, whoa! We did not expect how much demand there would be for the retail side of this type of bakery and in store clients soon far surpassed our wholesale clients. Since opening our doors, we've essentially been growing non-stop and have just been trying to play keep-up. We've now outgrown that space and need to expand. We're of course staying in that location - we're established there and love the heck out of that neighbourhood, so we've decided to open a 2nd location in Kanata where we can bake out of a 2nd kitchen, increasing our production levels, as well as have a few seats where people can sit down and enjoy a coffee or tea with their treat.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Present</strong></h3>
<p>When we set out to find a 2nd location we didn't realize how hard it was going to be to find a good space and how expensive it was going to be! We just barely managed to secure a bank loan to purchase equipment and to fit up the space, but the amount the bank is lending us is not nearly enough. The unit we found is a complete empty shell and needs to be built from nothing. This is an incredibly costly undertaking and we are $60,000 short from what the bank is lending us. We will not back away though! We are determined to build this kitchen to expand our menu, to expand our reach, and to create an even better space where people with alternative diets can enjoy what they're eating while feeling safe knowing that there is zero risk of cross-contamination. We know we can do it, but we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Future - Why back us?</h3>
<p>Inclusivity is the name of the game for us. By contributing to our campaign you will be helping create a space where everyone can treat themselves and not feel left out. Regardless of the fact that we're vegan, gluten-free, and nut-free, we won the 2019 Top Choice Award for Best Bakery in Ottawa and the 2018 Ottawa Magazine Award for Best Bakery, and are just as yummy as traditional bakeries (if not more!). We also plan to expand our wholesale to reach more people with a wider variety of product. Customers have been telling us for years how much it would mean to them to be able to get a wider variety of our treats in more areas across Ontario and even Canada. With a bigger kitchen, we can start filling this void, expanding our reach, and helping even more people who wouldn't otherwise be able to enjoy treats like everyone else.</p>
<p>When we started Strawberry Blonde Bakery we had no idea the kind of impact we'd have on our customers and on Ottawa. But we realize now more than ever, how important it is to create inclusive, delicious treats and to grow this business to help even more people.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently $60,000 over budget on construction so we're asking everyone we know for help. The more money we can raise, the greater chance we have of success. Your money will go to building the proper vents for ovens, purchasing bakery equipment (believe me when I say it's EXPENSIVE. Specifically buying a large customer freezer to produce more ""take &amp; bake"" goods, buying bigger more powerful mixers to produce more at a time, 2 DONUT FRYERS TO MAKE MORE DONUTS!), just generally creating a bigger kitchen to produce more treats to help reach more people and expand our line, as well as creating a sit down retail area.</p>
<p>In return for your contribution we have some pretty awesome perks for you! Like everything we do, they are creative and fun!</p>
<p>Believe us when we say that even if we don't reach our entire campaign goal, every penny raised is much needed and will be spent on creating a great space for customers and staff alike.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The underlying philosophy behind Strawberry Blonde Bakery is to ensure that no person should have to compromise delicious food regardless of dietary choices or allergies. SBB’s products raise the bar for the quality of allergen-free baked goods and sets a new standard for the industry. Too often, those with restrictive or alternative diets feel left out, or end up with food that is subpar at best. By contributing to this campaign, you are helping to ensure that everyone is able to have a treat that looks and tastes as good, or even better, as everyone else’s. You'll be helping to spread love, joy, and just general yumminess to those people (often children!) who wouldn't otherwise have an option. Not to mention you're helping support a small, local business that gives back to the local community whenever possible! Last year alone we donated over $6000 to over 60 local charities such as CHEO, various animal sanctuaries, art festivals, etc. </p>
<p>Our location in Wellington West has grown more than we ever could imagine. What started out as 2 people has now grown to a team of 25. But our Wellington West location is small. We need to expand to keep up with demand. We are confident that we can continue our success, but like all successes in life, they are never done alone. We're relying on our customers to help.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting a business is always risky. Opening a 2nd location is even riskier because the cost is much greater. When we started Strawberry Blonde Bakery 6 years go, we did it on a $45,000 loan. We were lucky enough to find a space that had a ventilation hook up for the oven and the rest we built over time, buying another mixer, 2nd oven, more freezers as we needed them. For location #2 we couldn't find a space with the required venting (boy do we realize now how lucky we were the first time around!) and we're having to do everything from the ground up. We know what our production levels will be and now that we're an established brand, customers rightfully have expectations that this 2nd location will offer everything our 1st location does, and more. To do that we need all the equipment from day 1. The cost of fitting up the space and purchasing equipment alone for the 2nd location is $300,000. To take on that risk is enormous, which is why we're asking for help.</p>
<p>So what qualifies us to overcome these hurdles? The difference now this time around is that we have 6 years under our belt. 6 years of learning how to run a business. 6 years of trial and error and coming out successful. We have an incredibly hard working and dedicated staff. But also, we have a loyal customer base with strong community support. You love what we do and for that we are so grateful! We are an established business, with an ever-growing brand recognition and with your help, we can achieve even more! There is no doubt in our minds that once our 2nd location is up and running that we can create more product to help us pay our bills.</p>

</div></div>","Past
My name is Jacqui and I'm the owner of Strawberry Blonde Bakery. After becoming vegan 12 years ago, I was disappointed by the lack of selection of vegan pastries available. Determined to stay vegan, but not give up on treats, I started baking myself. I absolutely loved converting traditional recipes into my own creations (especially the eating part!). I decided I wanted to turn this into a career and open my own vegan bakery to fill the void and share my delicious creations. But opening a business is no small feat and I knew that if I was going to do this, I was going to have to do it right. So I enrolled in George Brown College's Baking & Pastry Arts Management Program. Upon graduation I moved to Ottawa and started doing market stands. It was here that I really listened to all my customers and learned about the growing number of allergies and how often if a person had one allergy, they had multiple allergies. Being vegan for a number of years, I knew what it was like to go somewhere and not have a dessert option at all, or if there was, it was something sad looking or some old piece of fruit. I decided to eliminate gluten and nuts from my baking as well to ensure I could include as many people as possible on this journey of delicious, inclusive treats.
6 years ago I launched Strawberry Blonde Bakery, which was (still is and always will be) 100% vegan, gluten-free, nut & peanut free. The original focus was baking for wholesale clients such as health food stores and cafes. However, there was soon a growing demand from customers who tried our treats but wanted to purchase custom birthday cakes or sugar cookies from us. We decided to find a bigger kitchen where we could bake more, but also have a small space for customers to pick up their custom orders. That's when we found our current space on Grange Ave in the Wellington West neighbourhood of Ottawa. But, whoa! We did not expect how much demand there would be for the retail side of this type of bakery and in store clients soon far surpassed our wholesale clients. Since opening our doors, we've essentially been growing non-stop and have just been trying to play keep-up. We've now outgrown that space and need to expand. We're of course staying in that location - we're established there and love the heck out of that neighbourhood, so we've decided to open a 2nd location in Kanata where we can bake out of a 2nd kitchen, increasing our production levels, as well as have a few seats where people can sit down and enjoy a coffee or tea with their treat.

<h2>The South and Blanc du Bois</h2>
<p>Most people who live in the southern states know what a muscadine wine is.  This grape grows wild and thrives in the southern heat.  It makes a very good sweet wine that most southerners have learned to Love and enjoy.  But what about people who like a dry white or dry red wine?  They are not able to find a nice local winery that has what they are looking for.  However, several collages have started to develop these nice hybrid grapes that are able to withstand the southern heat.  The keep up of these grapes is a little bit more expensive than a muscadine grape, but well worth it.  We own a small family winery in West Point, GA and if you visit our winery looking for a muscadine wine you will not find it.  Instead, we make traditional varietal wines and some blended fruit wines.  But the juice we use has to come from California since these grapes will not grow here, with the exception of Blanc du Bois, Blueberries, and Apples.  We have 10 acres of land and our goal is to fill it up with this amazing American Hybrid Blanc du Bois.  We started our fist block in March of 2016 and have not finished it yet.  This particular grape will make anything from a sweet white to a dry white wine and will be our signature wine.   </p>

<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>We need just a little help getting finished with our first block of Blanc du Bois vineyard.  We had some help from a friend who is already growing the grapes on his property but for the most part we have tackled everything ourselves.  Once we are able to finish the vineyard we will be that much closer to a full harvest and making this new wine available in the South.  </p>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>This campaign is unlike any you have seen before. There are two parts to this campaign.</p>
<p>1)      This campaign is about getting the industrial wheels turning to provide a better wheelchair solution. The i5d wheelchair will improve the lives of millions. The i5d is only possible with the LRM platform technology.</p>
<p>2)      This campaign is also about providing the spark for you to be an entrepreneur. You are invited to start your own business by developing a product based on our patented LRM technology.</p>
<p>Success makes future successes possible. With your help we will make the i5d a success and make it easier for new LRM based products to follow. We look forward to seeing what you can do. We are committed to helping people with the i5d wheelchair and helping you to succeed with your own LRM application.</p>
<p><strong>There is a lot going on here. It is ok to skip to the section that interests you the most. You can use the pictures as your guide</strong></p>
<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>We all worked for large corporations. We decided we could do more outside of the corporate world, so we started our own design and build engineering company. We are Procubed and we solve problems with innovation and hard work.</p>
<p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479391235/htritra4jdfz4edqsez6.png"" src="""" style=""""/>                                             (See: <a href=""http://www.procubedllc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.procubedllc.com</a> ) Having our own business has been like digging a tunnel to escape from the corporate cube farm. To make our business a success and stay off the cube farm, we had to be a loyal team. We had to learn and improve, and support each other. We got smarter, and had a good time building a business. To make money, we contracted to design and build stuff for other corporations. We met lots of great people and they asked how we got to be more independent, only visiting the cube farm. I would tell people about our in-house project and tell them that when it is a big success we might be able to hire them, and help them escape the cube farm. For almost 10 years, that is the way it was. We would get engineering development jobs, interact with great people and work on our in-house project. Our project is a new kind of transmission with massive application potential. We call our transmission the LRM i.e. the Linear to Rotary Motion mechanism.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479511658/qjvcggglyhslz5ix37zh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The LRM Trainer is fun to play with. The Trainer can power your experiments while you and your team learn how to apply the LRM to a product innovation that enriches lives. Trainers come with supporting documentation describing how the LRM works, including examples of various configurations. Pick an application, or dream up one of your own and develop a product.</p>
<p>We have applied the LRM to make a better manual wheelchair, to create a revolutionary mobility upgrade.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479578429/cqq2q8h7pdkj8fgxz3e0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><u><strong>We call the LRM driven wheelchair, the i5d</strong></u>. The meaning behind the name is an extra dimension of mobility for the individual. The i5d wheelchair makes rim drive obsolete because more power gets to the wheels without hurting the rider. The most important feature of the LRM driven i5d wheelchair is the elimination of painful repetitive stress that robs people of healthy mobility. The i5d is an attention getting, first application of the LRM technology platform. We will use that attention to get the world excited about the i5d and the potential of other LRM product applications.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">[ <strong><u>Note: Your LRM application can ride the i5d wave to significance</u></strong>.]</p>

<h2>Questions and Answers:</h2>
<p><strong>Q)</strong> Why is Procubed making the LRM platform available for development?</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> Great question. There are a few reasons why we want other people involved.<strong> 1)</strong> We believe that great things are possible when talented people work together.<strong> 2)</strong> We want you to get a significant value for your support. <strong>3)</strong> Our focus is the i5d wheelchair, we do not have time to work on all possible LRM applications.<strong> 4)</strong> We know that you can do more, you just need a way to get started. <strong>5)</strong> We need help to deliver a better wheelchair to 200 million people.</p>
<p><strong>Q)</strong> Do I own the LRM application that I develop?</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> Yes, you own what you develop. All LRM application developers will need to inform Wisys of the intent to market an LRM product. See: <a href=""http://www.wisys.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wisys.org</a> App Developers and Wisys will negotiate a license agreement that provides Intellectual Property rights for each Developer. Our experience is that your fees will be less than 10% of your sales.</p>
<p><strong>Q)</strong> Why do I have to pay a patent royalty on my sales?</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> Wisys took a risk and paid for the LRM patent. Royalty payments make it possible for Wisys to help others. <u>The advantage to you is patent protection while eliminating the risk of paying without receiving.</u> A patent can cost more than $100,000 and a return on that investment is not guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>Q)</strong> Will the i5d wheelchair be offered as a perk?</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> The i5d could be added as a stretch goal. Production and delivery would have to follow the units built for the market study. Procubed will cut the price of an i5d wheelchair to anyone who bought an LRM Trainer. The discount will be equal to the cost of the Trainer purchased. In addition, we will be adding an application section to our website for anyone wanting to get on the list for an evaluation i5d wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>Q)</strong> What does an i5d wheelchair cost?</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> The cost depends on how many are built. We can make them for less in larger quantities. The first two Gen-4 prototypes cost a crazy big number. Moving forward; 1 to 10 would be about $8000 each, 10 to 20 around $6000 each and in production the cost should be around $3500. We will make and donate as many i5d wheelchairs as possible depending on the economics of scale.</p>
<p><strong>Q)</strong> Why does Procubed want to license the i5d wheelchair to a DME, instead of selling it directly?</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> The short answer is; speed and significance. A license agreement uses the big DMEs infrastructure to help more people, faster.</p>
<p><strong>Q)</strong> Where can my LRM application team find help to complete a product?</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> Resources include the team network channeled through Procubed's website. In addition, in the USA there are Small Business Development offices connected to universities.<u> See: <a href=""http://www.sba.gov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sba.gov</a></u> . Contact one of these offices and partner with faculty and students. Many universities have machine shops, including 3D printers. You will have fun and meet great people, if you give it a try.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Perks:</h2>
<p>The LRM Trainers are available with or without a 12 Volt DC, 40 Watt Generator.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479519184/mz2reyjaokejsjw90div.png"" src="""" style=""""/>         </p>
<p><strong><u>The LRM Training Kits are designed to be fun, useful and educational.</u></strong> They are designed to be taken apart and put back together. Hands on experience can be the best educational tool. The LRM can be built from whatever materials are available locally. Metal and plastic are not required. A creative team could work with bamboo and twine. You will be connected to Procubed and the international team of developers. Documentation will be sent to you by email, and a paper copy is shipped with each LRM Trainer. Your group will be added to the list of international developers. Developers benefits include; i5d project updates, networking and a discount on a future i5d purchase. If the i5d is added as a stretch Perk, application team members will get a price cut equal to the price they paid for a trainer.</p>
<p>Some of the LRM application categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Mobility</li>
<li>Battery Charging</li>
<li>Power from waves or tides</li>
<li>Wind Power</li>
<li>Sports</li>
<li>Down Riggers and Fishing Tackle</li>

</div></div>","Introduction:
This campaign is unlike any you have seen before. There are two parts to this campaign.
1)      This campaign is about getting the industrial wheels turning to provide a better wheelchair solution. The i5d wheelchair will improve the lives of millions. The i5d is only possible with the LRM platform technology.
2)      This campaign is also about providing the spark for you to be an entrepreneur. You are invited to start your own business by developing a product based on our patented LRM technology.
Success makes future successes possible. With your help we will make the i5d a success and make it easier for new LRM based products to follow. We look forward to seeing what you can do. We are committed to helping people with the i5d wheelchair and helping you to succeed with your own LRM application.
There is a lot going on here. It is ok to skip to the section that interests you the most. You can use the pictures as your guide
Background:
We all worked for large corporations. We decided we could do more outside of the corporate world, so we started our own design and build engineering company. We are Procubed and we solve problems with innovation and hard work.
                                                 (See: www.procubedllc.com ) Having our own business has been like digging a tunnel to escape from the corporate cube farm. To make our business a success and stay off the cube farm, we had to be a loyal team. We had to learn and improve, and support each other. We got smarter, and had a good time building a business. To make money, we contracted to design and build stuff for other corporations. We met lots of great people and they asked how we got to be more independent, only visiting the cube farm. I would tell people about our in-house project and tell them that when it is a big success we might be able to hire them, and help them escape the cube farm. For almost 10 years, that is the way it was. We would get engineering development jobs, interact with great people and work on our in-house project. Our project is a new kind of transmission with massive application potential. We call our transmission the LRM i.e. the Linear to Rotary Motion mechanism.

The LRM Trainer is fun to play with. The Trainer can power your experiments while you and your team learn how to apply the LRM to a product innovation that enriches lives. Trainers come with supporting documentation describing how the LRM works, including examples of various configurations. Pick an application, or dream up one of your own and develop a product.
We have applied the LRM to make a better manual wheelchair, to create a revolutionary mobility upgrade.

We call the LRM driven wheelchair, the i5d. The meaning behind the name is an extra dimension of mobility for the individual. The i5d wheelchair makes rim drive obsolete because more power gets to the wheels without hurting the rider. The most important feature of the LRM driven i5d wheelchair is the elimination of painful repetitive stress that robs people of healthy mobility. The i5d is an attention getting, first application of the LRM technology platform. We will use that attention to get the world excited about the i5d and the potential of other LRM product applications.
[ Note: Your LRM application can ride the i5d wave to significance.]

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A) The input levers control everything through the LRMs, summing all motion into rotation in the direction selected. Right and Left sides work independently allowing for zero radius turns. B) The front casters have a shock absorbing suspension, by Frog Legs Inc. C) The drive wheels are smaller than standard because rim drive is not the primary mover. Smaller wheels take up less space, allow for better maneuverability and facilitates surface transfer. The wheels have quick disconnect hubs to aid in transport. D) Anti-Tip wheels have a quick-disconnect feature to aid in transport. E) Folding seat back for additional ease of transport.
We have struggled to find the time and money to develop the LRM and the i5d wheelchair. Along our journey we met and worked with outstanding people and organizations including:
1)Wisys Technology Foundation, 2)The University of Wisconsin System in particular UW-Parkside, 3)Wisconsin’s Business Plan Contest, 4)Biz-Starts Milwaukee, 5)Frog Legs in Iowa gave us evaluation casters and encouragement. 6)We were introduced to the staff of VA Hospitals through the 82nd Airborne Veterans Aide organization. 7)We met great people at the Veterans Administration including the rehabilitation team at Walter Reed. 8)We received reviews and design input from mobility experts like the staff at the Human Engineering and Research Lab in Pittsburgh PA. 9)We had discussions with other experts including the marketing team at Invacare. We learned what it would take to get Invacare or another DME to distribute the i5d wheelchair internationally.
Experts have validated the need for a better manual wheelchair. The experts we value the most are the riders, especially the veterans who volunteered to test our prototypes.
Current Status:
We applied the LRM to a manual wheelchair and achieved more power to the wheels, smaller foot print (closer to the space used by a standing person), improved surface transfers, and eliminated stress injury. With the LRM, we were able to do it all while keeping the weight below 35 pounds. That is great, but how do we get a regulated medical device to the market?
We need help to market the i5d. Our i5d wheelchair can't do any good if we can't market it. The Marketing efforts begin with proving the value of the i5d to a significant number of riders and end with a license agreement with Invacare or another Durable Medical Equipment provider specializing in personal mobility.
Entrepreneurs learn to use what is available to them to survive and ultimately thrive. It’s always a challenging puzzle to define an objective, identify the resources, communicate the mission, and implement a plan. For entrepreneurs, the goal is to generate value and a good experience for everyone involved.
i5d Marketing Logistics:

Wheelchairs including the i5d are regulated medical products. Selling a new medical device requires working with the Food and Drug Administration. Significant supporting data is required to sell a new product.
Veterans have demonstrated a need for a better wheelchair and a desire to help evaluate the i5d wheelchair.
The international wheelchair market is dominated by these DMEs (Durable Medical Equipment providers) Invacare and Sun-Rise Medical. The fastest way to help the most people is to get one of the big DMEs to distribute the i5d. A DME corporation will not risk market share on an unproven new wheelchair.
We can obtain the user data needed to convince the DMEs and the FDA, if we give i5ds away. A large number of i5d wheelchairs will provide the data and references needed to be convincing.
Can we find a way to use the LRM to generate the cash needed to build i5d wheelchairs, and get the wheelchairs to user volunteers to verify performance?

The LRM Drives the i5d Forward with Your Help
The best thing we have to sell to generate cash and drive the i5d introduction effort is access to the LRM technology. The proven and patented technology can be applied to many devices. The Trainer and supporting documentation makes understanding the LRM easy. We would love to see your product campaign here in a few months.
We all know about apps for your phone and all that software based stuff that has made so many people wealthy. Well, this is about mechanics and builders making apps. Programing skills are not required. The ability to build something will serve you better for this task.
We are inviting you to crank up your inner entrepreneur and use the patented LRM technology to create your own product. The LRM is very versatile and can be used to make all kinds of things perform better. We are inviting you to be an inventor, an entrepreneur and create your own business.
Before you market your product you will have to contact Wisys to secure a patent license. Contact: licensing@wisys.org to work out the contract. The good people at Wisys will make it work for you.

The LRM training program includes documentation, personal support and i5d progress updates.
Location Notes:

The Trainer is made in the same shop with the same tools that machine the parts for the i5d.
Our shop is about two stone throws from what was the AMC/Rambler/Nash auto factory.
We hope to help change what has become rusty and crusty into something green and clean.

How LRM Team Collaborations Work:

You build a team that has a desire to accomplish great things.
Your team buys a training program.
We help you learn about the LRM.
We use some of the proceeds from your LRM purchase to provide free i5d wheelchairs to disabled veterans and interested individuals.
We get people around the world talking about the i5d and the value of the LRM product applications.
You develop your own LRM application and patent license agreement with Wisys; licensing@wisys.org.
We support your efforts to market your LRM based product application.
Together we build an international business.
You will end up in a position to do more great things.

A) Resources include the team network channeled through Procubed's website. In addition, in the USA there are Small Business Development offices connected to universities. See: www.sba.gov . Contact one of these offices and partner with faculty and students. Many universities have machine shops, including 3D printers. You will have fun and meet great people, if you give it a try.
 
Perks:
The LRM Trainers are available with or without a 12 Volt DC, 40 Watt Generator.
         
The LRM Training Kits are designed to be fun, useful and educational. They are designed to be taken apart and put back together. Hands on experience can be the best educational tool. The LRM can be built from whatever materials are available locally. Metal and plastic are not required. A creative team could work with bamboo and twine. You will be connected to Procubed and the international team of developers. Documentation will be sent to you by email, and a paper copy is shipped with each LRM Trainer. Your group will be added to the list of international developers. Developers benefits include; i5d project updates, networking and a discount on a future i5d purchase. If the i5d is added as a stretch Perk, application team members will get a price cut equal to the price they paid for a trainer.
Some of the LRM application categories are:

Personal Mobility
Battery Charging
Power from waves or tides
Wind Power
Sports
Down Riggers and Fishing Tackle
Human Powered cars and airplanes
Engines (See www.procubedllc.com for a growing list of applications.)

We made the training kits available in discounted groups to be donated to schools, veterans groups and clubs to help encourage a new generation of makers and maybe get them started in business.
Charging Notes:

The LRM driven generator will charge a 12 volt battery directly. A diode is shown being used in the video above. The diode is there to keep the electrons flowing to the battery not away from the battery.
Phone charging can be done through a DC to DC adapter connected to a battery charged by the LRM or connected directly to the LRM.


A converter for 12 Volt DC to 5 Volt DC, output through a usb connection.
[A blog will be added to the Procubed website for sharing how to tips.]
Logo Branded Perk Items
We think the Logos look good on products and apparel. We are machine designers but we had some fun trying to be artistic with the logos. Art and machine design have some similar characteristics. Simple but imaginative seems to be the common requirement of good design and art.
If you would like to support the i5d pain free wheelchair project without taking on an application project please consider buying one of the branded items we are offering. They are available with any of the logos that represent the i5d, powered by the LRM and developed by Procubed.

In appreciation of the service our veterans have given us we asked the Oscar Mike Foundation to make a special Tee Shirt with the Oscar Mike logo on the sleeve and the i5d logo on the front.
See: www.oscarmike.org/foundation/   Oscar Mike means ""On the Move"" and that is what the Oscar Mike Foundation does for Veterans. That is consistent with the mission of the i5d wheelchair.
 

 
 
 

 
 
The Southern Wisconsin Chapter of the of the 82nd Airborne works hard to help veterans, Check out their website: www.82ndswaac.com

If you buy one of these ""military"" shirts the Southern Wisconsin 82nd will get $5. All the shirts are available in sizes small to XXL.
Everybody can use more canvas totes. These tots are 13 1/2 X 15 inches tall.

 
Show your support with style and comfort with one of these first edition caps.

 
For those days when you have to dress better than a Tee-Shirt we offer the following.

These Sport Shirts would be great for your application development team.
 
Store one of these embroidered logo windbreakers in your car for those days when the weather catches you by surprise:

Stay warm and dry while you look good in one of these special jackets.
 
LRM Team and i5d Schedule

 
Closing Statement
Our biggest obstacle to overcome is having the time to focus on introducing the world to the i5d pain free wheelchair. Your support will help us focus on providing a product and a concept that matters. We know the world needs a better wheelchair that keeps people healthy and mobile. We know that many of you can be entrepreneurs with a little help. We think the LRM can be the platform to launch your new career as an entrepreneur. We’ll do our part and prove the value of the LRM technology with the i5d.
THANK YOU for joining us on this incredible journey! We look forward to telling you about the people we are helping with the i5d. We will be eager to read and share the stories of international LRM application teams, like yours.
Warmest regards,

<p>I'm Ryan Haerer, and Sun Fish Farm is my passion.</p>
<p>You may not know it, but the world needs 50 percent more food to feed the world, but have little land left on which to do it. 2017 may see the worst famine in human history - some projections suggest up to 20 million people may starve to death.</p>
<p>In the oceans, commercial overfishing and environmental damage are wreaking havoc and 90 percent of ocean fisheries are on the verge of collapse. They will not be able to produce fish at this rate for very much longer.</p>
<p>At home, many people can't afford the benefits of eating a diverse diet of delicious vegetables, because our food system focuses on large scale monocultures and crop specialization that limits choice, availability, and can hurt the environment in several ways.</p>
<p>I've designed a new greenhouse based system that uses the power of water to address all of these issues simultaneously. Once we build, Sun Fish Farm will build and share our design to make more land available for environmentally friendly year-round greenhouse farming of both food and fish. The system is fully sustainable; supports local farming, AND benefits the environment.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The story begins 11 years ago in Baghdad, Iraq. In 2006, I was an enlisted combat medic and planning on becoming an officer in the Army.  My military career was short that year when I was injured when our humvee was blown apart by a roadside bomb. </p>
<p>Losing one of the men under my responsibility was way more damaging than the physical injuries.  After some dark times, I vowed to find a way to help people in the US and abroad avoid pain and conflict. I returned home to go to college at Ohio State, studied international development, and learned about the interconnections between energy, food, water, and environmental security issues around the world while studying at Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>I'm asking for your support to launch Sun Fish Farm because we need to address all of the  health, environment, and security risks associated with growing enough food, replacing what we've already destroyed in the oceans, and protecting and rebuilding our ecosystems for our grandkids.  I believe we can grow an abundance of sustainable food, promote economic growth for farmers, and enhance environmental protection - at the same time.</p>
<p>Fish farms exist, but some come with environmental drawbacks. With your help, we can demonstrate how we can use clean energy to grow truly sustainable fish, even in places with limited water, with a process that simultaneously fights environmental damage for the long run and repairs the natural environment around us now.  We can also grow vegetables more productively, year round, by using the moderating warming and cooling effects of the fishwater in the greenhouses to maintain growing temperatures for farms - no matter the weather outsider - ice, heat wave, hail, or drought.  More healthy fish, more healthy food, safe from the weather, and beneficial for the environment.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need a minimum $18,000 in capital to install our initial geothermal energy system, photovoltaic panels, energy-efficient solar greenhouses, and renewable aquaculture waterways on our land near Shenandoah National Park.  We hope to raise way more, because we can put more greenhouses and more fish, vegetables and plants.  But more importantly, we can multiply our impact by testing several  modified prototypes of the renewable fishery system.  With additional funding, we can maximize the speed of perfecting the system.  The quicker we build, learn, and test, the quicker we can share the results with others.</li>
<li>Our perks are specifically designed to raise a lot of funding - the vegetables and fish are essentially pre-sales, at half price, and unbeatable values.  Everything else is great too.  We believe so much in funding this, and believe it will happen. But we also want to make sure people get rewarded, enjoy the product, and tell their friends.  We anticipate we will build relationships and future customers while we are at it!  Building demand for environmentally food will help us and other farmers bring more of it to so many communities where it doesn't exist yet.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know that building any new prototype takes some iterations. Its never perfect the first time.  But the good thing is that we know that everything we're using - the renewable energy, the aquaponic technology, the techniques for growing fish - have been proven for years by themselves.  We've just invented a way to combine them that we don't believe has been done before. That knowledge comes because I've been doing and learning how to successfully raise fish since I built my first aquaculture system 5 years ago.  It grew fish healthy fish, but over the years we saw how it could have been so much better on energy use! In my day job, I've continued to learn energy, water, and environmental technology while working in my professional career in environmental safety.  All this experience makes us firmly believe we have the knowledge, supporting team, and the Army mindset - never quit - that will guarantee we make this happen. When we encounter hurdles - we'll treat them as opportunities to improve the system.  The needs for climate change fighting, environmentally beneficial aquaculture and farming are too great not to make this work.</p>

<li>Please email our campaign link to your friends and family, share it on Facebook, and let everyone know you support us. Any way you can get the word out and make some noise about Sun Fish Farm helps us reach our goal.  Lots of $10-20 donations go a very long way together.</li>

<p>I have travelled extensively and found that the most unique experiences have created the best memories.</p>
<p>Shorty's originated when I was 4 years old during a rather snowy December, where I was asked which treat I would like from the shop during a special day out. Of course, I asked for an ice-cream. As you can imagine, this was met with a 'WHAT....it's far too cold for ice cream!' to which I softly replied 'well, why do they sell it then?' My mother has retold this story on many occasions. The delight I feel from supplying ice cream to young members of my family during snowy wintery days always reminds me of the adventure I had. I would love to impart memories to others to create a story for another mum to tell.</p>
<p>As my funding options are limited I wanted to try alternative methods. Every penny of funding raised here will be going towards the equipment needed to create the products I will sell, even if I don't reach my entire goal.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The majority of aspects within Shorty's will be unique! From the ice cream flavours, other frozen products all the way to hot desserts and fresh juices. Not only offering tasty treats, also offering healthy options and gluten free products. With the foresight of Vegan friendly and Diabetic safe ice cream.</p>
<p>There will be something for everyone!</p>
</div><div>
<p>I am focused on supporting the local village in any way I can, especially through Shorty's. All items will be sourced from local suppliers, where able. I also wish to create a unique presence within the village to attract additional trade and not 'borrow' from my fellow businesses.</p>
<p>Any contribution made to Shorty's will be so appreciated and will massively help to fund a local start-up business dedicated to supporting the village and other local enterprises.</p>
</div><p>Shorty's so far has been funded solely by me, I am 'all in' with every penny I have. The challenge I am now facing is creating a unique experience and providing the best possible quality product with the equipment I hope to use.</p><div>

Founded by  our Chief Mastermind, Nizenande Machi. Her passion for people development brought about the idea to build a sustainable business solution aimed at capacitating entrepreneurs and business professionals struggling to achieve their next. This is because they face poor levels of emotional health, high financial losses before long term gains, a lack of professional knowledge and skills to make it into the next level of management, a survivalist lived reality and a need for growth/customer acquisition. These struggles formed the foundation of Karani’s business model and directly integrated social impact into Karani Leadership’s mission and value proposition. </p><p>Karani's purpose is to equip all African professionals with the knowledge required to lead transformatively, live freely and earn sustainable livelihoods. We’ve made it our mission to be Africa’s leading leadership development consultancy. Simultaneously, we envision a world where Africans recognize their agency and learning capacity; where Africans can productively apply their talents to transform their spheres of influence. This is a world with Relevant, Authentic, Reliable and Ethical (R.A.R.E.) leaders who build wealth systems that contribute to African economic freedom. </p><p>Our crowdfunding campaign has been created for two primary reasons; both of which are centered around the previously mentioned mission and vision. First and foremost, Karani would like to put the finishing touches on its SDG Fellowship Program. This SDG Fellowship Program acts as a small business accelerator and will support a cohort of female, African entrepreneurs. The Fellowship seeks to hold the hands of these rising entrepreneurs through financial, psychosocial and academic support. This support will enable our entrepreneurs to turn their growing entrepreneurial endeavours into socially oriented, sustainable and profitable enterprises. </p><p>Secondly, Karani has a too big, too small dilemma. We are receiving more demand for our services, yet our current infrastructure is largely underdeveloped to support this demand. Contributions toward the Enable Karani: Empower Social Enterprise crowdfunding campaign will enable Karani to scale and meet their level of demand as well as empower a cohort of female entrepreneurs. </p><h2> </h2><h2>Why Karani?</h2><p>Let's face it. Crowdfunding on IndieGoGo can be unpredictable and, ultimately, it's a leap of faith to contribute to any campaign. With that being said, here's what makes us so different. </p><p>First and foremost, Karani is in the business of investing in people. We support African developing professionals and entrepreneurs to achieve their own financial and creative freedom. By helping our clients integrate their lived experiences into sustainable business models, we are shaping the next generation of leaders.</p><p>Karani’s success is dependent on the level of positive impact we create for developing, African business professionals and entrepreneurs. In short, when we succeed, our clients succeed and when our clients succeed, it means we’ve made a difference. No, we aren't selling the latest smart phone, developing a new pair of headphones or defining the next fashion trend like so many other IndieGoGo campaigns. However, we are offering something much more powerful. Karani is selling the empowerment of African entrepreneurs and business professionals to earn sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>What else makes us different? Karani is female founded, owned and operated. It has more than six years of experience under its belt, and Karani has a level 1 ranking on the South African Governments Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) scale. </p><p>Finally, Karani is in the business of investing in people. This means that your contribution to our campaign is a contribution to support young people. While we hope to earn a fair compensation through our sustainable business model, we are really asking you to help us enable the next generation of African and female business leaders with the skills to succeed. After all, we are Karani Leadership, and we are in the business of Enabling Leaders. </p><p> </p><h2>How You're Helping Us</h2><p>We hope to reach 75 000 USD through your generous contributions, and here is the breakdown of how we intend to invest the crowdfunding contributions. </p><h3>Tech Enablement and IT Infrastructure</h3><p>Karani is investing 45% of campaign funds towards Tech Enablement &amp; IT Infrastructure. This includes upgrading Karani's website and mobile platforms to enable e-learning and portal access for members and alumni. Karani is also looking to develop mobile application programs that allow for greater, on-the-go access to educational material and support. Additionally, the improvement of technology helps to lay a strong foundation in which the SDG Fellowship Program will benefit from. Our cohort of female, African entrepreneurs will be well-equipped with contemporary business technology. </p><h3>SDG Fellowship Program</h3><p>Karani is investing 30% of campaign funds directly towards the SDG Fellowship Program.  These funds will directly contribute to finalizing the well-rounded curriculum, establishing application criteria, creating partnerships for the Fellowship and directly investing in the cohort of female entrepreneurs. </p><h3>Institutional Strengthening </h3><p>Karani will invest the remaining 25% of campaign funds toward Institutional Strengthening. Institutional Strengthening consists of Karani's Human Capital resources and business process reengineering. This will simultaneously enable a more efficient operation through a more stable structural and resource capacity. </p><p> </p><h2>How We're Helping You</h2><p>In return for your contribution, we have several rewards and ""thank you's"". These rewards all include a virtual high five and social media shoutouts as well as various opportunities to earn naming rights, hang out with members of the Karani team and even get your very own Karani Notebook and Pen. Check out our perks over on the right hand side to see everything that Karani has to offer. </p><p> </p><h2>Our Obstacles</h2><p>Karani is facing a ""too big, too small"" dilemma. We are facing increasing demand for our services (which is great!), however, it’s becoming overwhelming for our limited infrastructure and institutional capacity. </p><p>Another obstacle is Karani’s final campaign goal. We are in need of more than our $75,000 goal. Karani is seeking closer to ~$350,000 to fully fund and invest in our three primary categories (listed above). With that being said, our Enable Karani: Empower Social Enterprise campaign represents the perfect stepping stone to kick-start progress toward our long-term goals. </p><p>Another obstacle to overcome is our geographic location. While many IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaigns have succeeded all across the world, most South African campaigns that are not solely philanthropic are overlooked. Karani Leadership, however, has a sustainable and proven business model while simultaneously generating positive social impact. Karani should be anything but overlooked!</p><p>Finally, you may be tempted to scroll as a contributor because of our socially oriented business plan. While financial feasibility alongside social impact can be difficult, Karani has derived the perfect formula that balances business sustainability and financial returns. Karani is modeling the business citizen we believe all companies should be; one that returns a profit to investors and makes the world a better place at the same time. </p><p> </p><h2>Can't Contribute Money? Help Contribute Awareness!</h2><p>We understand that tons of people will find Karani Leadership and be in love with the mission and purpose of the Enable Karani: Empower Social Enterprise crowdfunding campaign. Unfortunately, not all of our supporters will be able to contribute and that’s ok. If you can't contribute to our crowdfunding campaign you can still help Karani by telling your friends, posting about us on social media and simply spreading news about Karani to anyone who might be interested. With your support, there is nothing stopping us from reaching our goal.</p></div>","We are Karani LeadershipKarani Leadership was born on February 1st, 2013 in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Our cohort of female, African entrepreneurs will be well-equipped with contemporary business technology. SDG Fellowship ProgramKarani is investing 30% of campaign funds directly towards the SDG Fellowship Program.  These funds will directly contribute to finalizing the well-rounded curriculum, establishing application criteria, creating partnerships for the Fellowship and directly investing in the cohort of female entrepreneurs. Institutional Strengthening Karani will invest the remaining 25% of campaign funds toward Institutional Strengthening. Institutional Strengthening consists of Karani's Human Capital resources and business process reengineering. This will simultaneously enable a more efficient operation through a more stable structural and resource capacity.  How We're Helping YouIn return for your contribution, we have several rewards and ""thank you's"". These rewards all include a virtual high five and social media shoutouts as well as various opportunities to earn naming rights, hang out with members of the Karani team and even get your very own Karani Notebook and Pen. Check out our perks over on the right hand side to see everything that Karani has to offer.  Our ObstaclesKarani is facing a ""too big, too small"" dilemma. We are facing increasing demand for our services (which is great!), however, it’s becoming overwhelming for our limited infrastructure and institutional capacity. Another obstacle is Karani’s final campaign goal. We are in need of more than our $75,000 goal. Karani is seeking closer to ~$350,000 to fully fund and invest in our three primary categories (listed above). With that being said, our Enable Karani: Empower Social Enterprise campaign represents the perfect stepping stone to kick-start progress toward our long-term goals. Another obstacle to overcome is our geographic location. While many IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaigns have succeeded all across the world, most South African campaigns that are not solely philanthropic are overlooked. Karani Leadership, however, has a sustainable and proven business model while simultaneously generating positive social impact. Karani should be anything but overlooked!Finally, you may be tempted to scroll as a contributor because of our socially oriented business plan. While financial feasibility alongside social impact can be difficult, Karani has derived the perfect formula that balances business sustainability and financial returns. Karani is modeling the business citizen we believe all companies should be; one that returns a profit to investors and makes the world a better place at the same time.  Can't Contribute Money? Help Contribute Awareness!We understand that tons of people will find Karani Leadership and be in love with the mission and purpose of the Enable Karani: Empower Social Enterprise crowdfunding campaign. Unfortunately, not all of our supporters will be able to contribute and that’s ok. If you can't contribute to our crowdfunding campaign you can still help Karani by telling your friends, posting about us on social media and simply spreading news about Karani to anyone who might be interested. With your support, there is nothing stopping us from reaching our goal.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>My name is John Tan and I'm from Singapore, I am a freelance web designer for more than 5 years and had helped people to create many websites either for their personal or business use.</p>
<p>During my freelancer years, I've encountered many people who wish to have a website of their own but just feel that it is too expensive to ask a profession web development to do it, or it is too technical for them to do it themselves.</p>
<p>In fact, I had help a few to do it for free or for a nominal free after listening to their story.</p>
<p>For personal website: I've got to hear a few people who actually have interesting stories to share with the world, but later give up because they could not get a proper website or others may just share it using social media. But deep down there, I knew they wanted to have a website of their own.</p>
<p>For small business: There were a few students I've met who wanted to start a business of their own but could not afford the price tag for a professional web developer to do up their website. And many of them had dropped off their opportunity due to this reason. I had since helped a few student to create a website so for them to pursue their dreams.</p>
<p>I wish to introduce my free website platform to more people around the world and hereby wish to be funded on this project.</p>
<p>This funding will help me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue to increase my marketing capability as I had used up most of my own pocket money in doing this.</li>
<li>purchase new website templates in the open market as also to support others web designers across the world.</li>
<li>upgrade to dedicated servers as my current shared server is hitting max and have noticed it being slowing down for my current users.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish to have a funding of $5000 USD in order for me to continue to run this project for the next 5 years.</p>
<p>This funds will be used mainly on marketing, buying of new templates and maintaining of servers.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that with this funding, I will have the ability let more people to know about this project so they will be able to have their own website for free.</p>

<p><strong><u>WHO WE ARE</u></strong></p>
<p>We are Woman’s Shelter, an autonomous, nonprofit Support Center for Abused Women founded in 2011  by a group of volunteers with vision and humanistic interest for stopping violence against women. We have our headquarters in Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece. Our organization is certified by the Ministry of Work, Social Insurance and Welfare of Greece for providing social care services. Our aim is to deal with the phenomenon of violence against women and to promote equality between men and women.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>HOW DOES KATAFYGIO GYNAIKAS-WOMAN’S SHELTER HELP</u></strong></p>
<p>We provide a complete support context to women who deal with abuse or have been victims of abuse in the past. We address to women above the age of 18 years old, without any discrimination, offering services of social and psychological support as well as legal counseling. Furthermore, we contribute to the provision of information  and public awareness regarding domestic violence and abuse against women in general.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO</u></strong></p>
<p>We want to create a  Hotline for Abused Women in the framework of expanding the range of services which Woman’s Shelter offers and of increasing the number of people who benefit from these services. The members of the scientific team, which is constituted of social workers, psychologists and lawyers, will provide through the Hotline for Abused Women various kinds of services such as information and education for the matter of women’s abuse to anyone who is interested, crisis’ intervention and handling on a practical and a psychosocial level, reference to other mental health organizations whenever this is necessary and psychological counseling through telephone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>WHY IS THIS HOTLINE FOR ABUSED WOMEN SO IMPORTANT</u></strong></p>
<p>Recent research findings, as well as our own empirical and statistical data, indicate an alarming number of Greek women who suffer from violence and abuse and an outbreak of the phenomenon of violence against women during the period of socioeconomic crisis in Greece. These findings combined with the lack of organizations which deal with the phenomenon of women’s abuse in many areas of Greece made us realize that the creation of a Hotline for Abused Women is a necessity.</p>

<p><strong><u>WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN</u></strong></p>

<p>We first brought the Hive Butler to beekeepers in person, at the Indiana Bee School in February 2016 as vendors. Even though we only had drawings of our design and no prototype, we had very positive responses among the attendees, and received multiple requests for wholesale pricing, distributorship plans, and quite a few pre-production orders.

...something better than fruit boxes and coolers and totes.  Honey is a precious commodity that requires heavy investments of time and money. Doesn't it deserve a protective mode of transport and storage?  Of course it does! 




oops....pardon me...excuse me...ouch...

How do you bring in your honey frames? How do you hold them until extraction? Heavy, dirty, bottomless supers? Grimy coolers? Tote boxes that let them stick together or fall over?  ...Really??  

Ick. A mess, and a loss of honey and sales...

We decided there had to be a better way.If this is your first look at the Hive Butler, please take a few minutes to review our original campaign here.
Our original campaign on Indiegogo was launched in 2015 to fund the development of the die needed to manufacture the Hive Butler. We didn't get the total amount of money required to get our die produced, but we did get a lot of hits, interest, and positive feedback.

Wax frames are quite possibly the most valuable tool in beekeeping, as they serve as the foundation of the hive. However, its delicate structure and components are often damaged during transportation and storage, resulting in loss of materials, product, and profit. Because the Hive Butler holds frames upright and secure, your wax foundation, and drawn-out comb is safe and sound as your frames are moved, stacked, and stored.  Even safe from wax moths!


Watch that wax start to sag, any minute now...

And then there are those random moments when you have bees and queen cells, or even Queens themselves, that need moved from one bee yard to another...Quick! Get the bottom board, empty box, another cover and some ratchet straps!  (Who has all that sitting around ready to go??)  The Hive Butler (with a screen-top lid!) would be amazing for quick, short-term bees-on-the-frame transport.

The Hive Butler will be doing that work for you too!  
The Hive Butler will be working for you, even when you're not...ALL YEAR LONG.

But just what is it going to look like?  We have pursued multiple avenues for a full-sized prototype for the Hive Butler.  Customers want to see the product they are investing in.  All estimates for one full-size Hive Butler prototype were over $8000!  That amount of money would pay for the down payment of our die.  So we went to a friend who is an engineering student at Purdue University, and he got their 3D printing lab to produce the Hive Butler in 1/4 scale size, which you can see below!

<p>With creativity and diversity at the heart of our practice, our ‘Making’
stream supports professional arts practice, providing paid work for established
and emerging artists with and without disability. Our ‘Learning’ stream, led by
our professional artists, is open to everyone to participate in the performing
arts through workshops, outreach and events.</p>
<p>Our learning program aims to give everyone, from
babies to seniors, no matter what their ability, background or perspectives,
access to quality experiences in the performing arts. Our learning program
advocates <b>inclusion</b>, welcomes <b>diversity</b>, promotes <b>integration</b>,
and creates <b>connections</b>.</p>
<p>We need to raise $30,000 to continue to run our
learning program. So far the company’s establishment has been supported by
local Council, State and Federal Government grants and some private donations,
but with last year's budget cuts, we missed out on much needed funds to run this
year's program.</p>

</p><p><b><span>Some words about our video's
music</span></b></p>
<p>The song 'Misirlou' although considered Turkish, is
song that started from Greece as rebetiko and became a worldwide success,
mainly through  Quantin Tarantino's film PULP FICTION.  Knowing
remixes on different musical styles (jazz, klezmer, Oriental, surf-rock,
garage-rock, etc.). Misirlou means woman from Misiri (= Egypt Arabic Misr) and
refers to Muslim Egypt, because the Christian of the area are called
Aigyptiotissa. Is about the love among Christian with Muslims that was taboo at
the time. First heard in Athens around 1927 by Michalis Patras Kompania, a
Smyrnian musician, who came to the capital with the wave of refugees from the
Asia minor catastrophe. Because of the subject, denied circa around 1930.</p>

<p>Since this has <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">became known </span>and gone very
well so far, I've been asked a lot of questions. I've tried to answer some more
below:</p>
<p><b>Who are you?</b></p>
<p></p><p>I'm 48 years old and live in Athens, Greece. I worked
as a consultant to small businesses. Also, I’ve been
involved into the promotion and exports of Greek products.</p>
<p>Today me and my team, highly qualified partners, run out our creativity in order to  complete our project and show everywhere that Greece is not only
the country of the crisis.</p><p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What will happen to the money?</b></p>
<p>We promise that all <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">donations </span>will be spent for the construction of our first
store and to create jobs for the Greeks unemployed.</p>
<p><b>Do you think that you can
reach the target?</b></p>
<p>We hope very much that the campaign will reach the
target. We think it will be a victory for people power.  We truly believe it
can be effective; remember it's a small amount per person we're looking for.
 </p>
<p><b>What happens if you don’t reach the target?</b></p>
<p>This is a flexible funding. Your funds are not refunded if we don’t reach our goal, but you can earn your perk.   </p><p>Hopefully we’ll make it through!
If we don't, we'll spend every single euro for charities.</p>
<p><b>Are the products real or
symbolic?</b></p>
<p>It’s not
symbolic - all products would be sourced from Greece, made in Greece and sent
from Greece.</p><p><br/></p>

<p><b>Λίγα λόγια για τη μουσική του βίντεο</b></p>
<p>Η Μισιρλού αν και θεωρείται τούρκικο, είναι τραγούδι που ξεκίνησε από την Ελλάδα ως ρεμπέτικο κι έγινε παγκόσμια επιτυχία, κυρίως μέσω της ταινίας PULP FICTION του Quantin Tarantino, γνωρίζοντας διασκευές σε διαφορετικά μουσικά στυλ (τζαζ, οριεντάλ, κλέζμερ, σερφ-ροκ, γκαράζ-ροκ κ.ά.). Μισιρλού σημαίνει γυναίκα από το Μισίρι (Μισρ=Αίγυπτος στα αραβικά) και αναφέρεται σε μουσουλμάνα της Αιγύπτου, καθότι τη χριστιανή της περιοχής την ονομάζουμε Αιγυπτιώτισσα. Ο έρωτας Χριστιανού με Μουσουλμάνα ήταν από τα ταμπού της εποχής. Πρώτο ακούστηκε στην Αθήνα γύρω στο 1927 από την κομπανία του Μιχάλη Πατρινού, ενός Σμυρνιού μουσικού, που ήρθε στην πρωτεύουσα με το κύμα των προσφύγων της Μικρασιατικής Καταστροφής. Λόγω του θέματός του, απαγορεύτηκε γύρω στο 1930.</p>

secrets of Greece, and let us be the reason for more people to get a job!Join us and let’s make together a ""peaceful revolution""
for the sake of Greece!!!
We want to make our country known internationally for
the right reason this time, not for financial crisis...
1 euro is enough to help us!!A jewel below the Acropolis (Athens)
Greek Soil's Choices Company's first store
in Athens is under construction. Located in a magnificent building in Acropolis
area, in which our customers will be able to explore the largest range of Quality Traditional Greek Products, all in the same place.Help us to complete the
construction of our store and employ some unemployed Greeks.
Why is this project Unique? The store itself is located
into a historical building, built around 1935, and our plans are to transform it into a ""time
machine"" which travels the visitor to another era. Every visit becomes a
personal experience.
All the goods that we'll offer to our customers produced by small traditional businesses that have a story to tell. Also recommend that our store will be decorated in  such a manner that looks like as a small museum of Art and Culture.
Let's open this door together!!! Participate and make it happen!!Tradition and CustomsWe realized, the powerful glue that kept us
together as people and as a nation all these years, and connects us with our ancestors, is just a
word called ""Tradition"".
Our Tradition is directly linked to the tastes of each
area. It includes special recipes, by products made with so much enthusiasm,
as Grandma's spanakopita. Products with a unique story, which is
important for us to share with you. Our goal is to luxuriate you in our Tradition, starting from the food, which is a basic need for everyone. However, by organizing feasts and other folklore events we'll bring all of us closer and then you will be able to experience what makes us different, what makes us
Greeks.
Our wish is, all of you who have experienced our Traditions, to
recall them from your memory and live them with us again. This will be the reason for you to have once more on your table
something with the taste and quality of ' those old times'.
For the rest of you who were not lucky enough to get
to know them, you're asked to delve into them; to become mystics.
We wish earnestly to bring to you, all these forgotten flavors,
into an environment that is both intimate and unique, that you won't want to live
without.
Your help is important, because our effort aims to
broaden the narrow Greek borders and become the meeting point of all, where
Hellenism exists.

Some words about our video's
music
The song 'Misirlou' although considered Turkish, is
song that started from Greece as rebetiko and became a worldwide success,
mainly through  Quantin Tarantino's film PULP FICTION.  Knowing
remixes on different musical styles (jazz, klezmer, Oriental, surf-rock,
garage-rock, etc.). Misirlou means woman from Misiri (= Egypt Arabic Misr) and
refers to Muslim Egypt, because the Christian of the area are called
Aigyptiotissa. Is about the love among Christian with Muslims that was taboo at
the time. First heard in Athens around 1927 by Michalis Patras Kompania, a
Smyrnian musician, who came to the capital with the wave of refugees from the
Asia minor catastrophe. Because of the subject, denied circa around 1930.
Here is performed by the excellent Venicio
Capossela

FAQs and
Press/Media
Since this has became known and gone very
well so far, I've been asked a lot of questions. I've tried to answer some more
below:
Who are you?
I'm 48 years old and live in Athens, Greece. I worked
as a consultant to small businesses. Also, I’ve been
involved into the promotion and exports of Greek products.
Today me and my team, highly qualified partners, run out our creativity in order to  complete our project and show everywhere that Greece is not only
the country of the crisis.

What will happen to the money?
We promise that all donations will be spent for the construction of our first
store and to create jobs for the Greeks unemployed.
Do you think that you can
reach the target?
We hope very much that the campaign will reach the
target. We think it will be a victory for people power.  We truly believe it
can be effective; remember it's a small amount per person we're looking for.
 
What happens if you don’t reach the target?
This is a flexible funding. Your funds are not refunded if we don’t reach our goal, but you can earn your perk.   Hopefully we’ll make it through!
If we don't, we'll spend every single euro for charities.
Are the products real or
symbolic?
It’s not
symbolic - all products would be sourced from Greece, made in Greece and sent
from Greece.

Ελληνική Παράδοση και ΈθιμαΣυνειδητοποιήσαμε πως αυτό που μας κράτησε σαν λαό και σαν έθνος όλα αυτά τα χρόνια και μας συνδέει με τους προγόνους μας,  είναι μια λέξη ""Παράδοση"".

Η παράδοση συνδέεται άμεσα με τις γεύσεις του κάθε τόπου, με ιδιαίτερες συνταγές, με προϊόντα φτιαγμένα με τόσο μεράκι, όσο η σπανακόπιτα της γιαγιάς. Προϊόντα που το κάθε ένα του κρύβει μια ξεχωριστή ιστορία, που για εμάς είναι σημαντικό να τη μοιραστούμε μαζί σας.
Στόχος μας είναι αρχίζοντας από το φαγητό, που είναι βασική ανάγκη για τον καθένα μας, να γνωρίσουμε σε βάθος την Ελληνική παράδοση, να κάνουμε εκδηλώσεις που θα μας φέρουν πιο κοντά σε αυτό που μας κάνει διαφορετικούς, σε αυτό που μας κάνει Έλληνες.

Και όσοι δεν ήταν αρκετά τυχεροί να τις γνωρίσουν, να έρθουν και να μυηθούν σ' αυτές.
Προσπαθούμε να φέρουμε κοντά σας όλες αυτές τις ξεχασμένες από πολλούς γεύσεις, μέσα από ένα περιβάλλον που θα είναι τόσο οικείο και μοναδικό, που δεν θα θέλετε να το αποχωριστείτε.
Η βοήθειά σας είναι σημαντική, γιατί η προσπάθειά μας έχει ως στόχο να διευρύνει τα στενά σύνορα της Ελλάδας και να γίνει το σημείο συνάντησης όλων, όπου υπάρχει Ελληνισμός.

<div>Hello, my name is Mark Gallant. I own The Dogfather food trucks in Worcester, MA. I've been in business since January 2010. From my humble beginnings with one truck, I have grown to three trucks and a new division called Dogfather Vending, LLC. A few years ago, Worcester legislated food trucks almost out of business. Now that there is a strong possibility that the regulations will be changed/relaxed, it's time that food trucks had a base of operations. I'm building a food commissary in my hometown of Worcester. This will be a place where local food trucks, both existing and new, can come to prep and store food, clean and sanitize their trucks and group together for buying power.

</div></div>","My Story
Hello, my name is Mark Gallant. I own The Dogfather food trucks in Worcester, MA. I've been in business since January 2010. From my humble beginnings with one truck, I have grown to three trucks and a new division called Dogfather Vending, LLC. A few years ago, Worcester legislated food trucks almost out of business. Now that there is a strong possibility that the regulations will be changed/relaxed, it's time that food trucks had a base of operations. I'm building a food commissary in my hometown of Worcester. This will be a place where local food trucks, both existing and new, can come to prep and store food, clean and sanitize their trucks and group together for buying power. My main goal is to help aspiring food trucks to navigate the permit process and get started on their dream.   My Dreams As you can see, I've already started the project. I need additional funds for walls and ceilings, permits, electrical, drains and shelving. My goal is to reach $12,500.00 so that I can make this a state of the art facility. Once completed, this will be the only one of it's kind in Central MA.  I already have a small group of local food trucks who have joined me, and have successfully launched a food truck event on the Worcester Common that draws crowds even in the winter. 
    What Happens Now Trucks will be able to drive in one door of the 2500 square foot facility, empty waste tanks, do dishes, prep food, restock, and drive right out a second door. I envision group Servsafe training, pooling our buying power, teaming up with local farms, and helping aspiring food truckers get going, thereby enhancing the food truck scene for Worcester.
The warehouse is in the canal district of Worcester, and I'm proud to be a part of the revitalization of this historic district for the past two years. Now it's time to take the next step.

Il tutto con un processo bottom-up, nel quale saranno gli stessi dipendenti in forza all’azienda a certificare le proprie condizioni lavorative. Attraverso le valutazioni anonime e controllate dei dipendenti stessi, si delineerà un quadro delle migliori imprese.</p><p>Ethicjobs vuole sensibilizzare ed indirizzare l’utente finale verso un circuito di acquisti più etici e consapevoli, rendendolo consapevole di chi e cosa sta finanziando, aumentando di conseguenza i flussi per le realtà che riusciranno a dimostrare ed ottenere i maggiori standard di qualità del lavoro dipendente.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>La storia</strong></h3><p>La nostra storia è semplice. Arriviamo da più parti d'Italia, ci incontriamo tutti a Rimini dove ci laureiamo e diventiamo grandi amici. Una volta laureati, invece di portare avanti sogni e ambizioni altrui offrendoci come dipendenti, decidiamo di provare a seguire una strada comune e realizzare un nostro sogno insieme.</p><p>Proviamo con qualche idea, ma falliamo. Ci riproviamo, ma di nuovo non va.</p><p>Un pochino iniziamo a cedere, chi trovi lavoro per mantenersi, chi non molla ma rallenta. Finché un giorno, ad un corso per start up, una grande donna dice:</p><p> </p><p>“Ragazzi, seguite i vostri scopi nobili. Mettete in piedi qualcosa che segua i vostri ideali, perché sarà allora che avrete lo stimolo e la voglia di alzarvi la mattina, lavorare 18h e continuare fiduciosi, anche davanti alle difficoltà.”</p><p> </p><p>Illuminati ci chiediamo come poter dar sfogo alla nostra voglia di cambiamento, ma nel frattempo continuiamo a lavorare per altri, per scopi esterni a noi.</p><p>In tutto questo continuiamo a vedere i nostri colleghi più o meno grandi di noi, ma meno fortunati o meno pronti a lottare, con i loro sogni ormai in un cassetto dimenticato, vivere male il posto di lavoro, e così anche la vita.</p><p>8-9-10h al giorno, poco tempo libero, poca scelta, poche soddisfazioni...</p><p>Iniziamo così a capire che il lavoro è un impegno importante, riempie gran parte della nostra giornata e da lui non si fugge, capiamo che solo vivendolo bene, solo se l'ambiente che si crea all'interno è sereno, le energie e il benessere non se ne vanno, e così quelle poche ore che ci restano al di fuori possono essere altrettanto serene e belle.</p><p> </p><p>Scusate, ma allora perché non creare solo ambienti lavorativi sereni??</p><p>E' questo che iniziamo a chiederci una sera chiacchierando davanti a una birra.</p><p> </p><p>(…..brainstorming</p><p>brainstorming</p><p>brainstorming</p><p>brainstorming.....</p><p>ETHICJOBS!</p><p>Un lampo nel cielo, Ethicjobs ci illumina come una cometa, come le parole della grande donna mesi e mesi indietro.</p><p>...ancora un po' di brainstorming...)</p><p> </p><p>Ed ecco: Ethicjobs punta i riflettori su quelle aziende che danno valore al capitale umano, che mettono al centro la persona, offrendo un ambiente lavorativo qualitativamente alto, sano, sereno ed etico. Ethicjobs premierà queste aziende e rilascerà un certificato, e aiuterà invece le quelle che non hanno ancora raggiunto questi standard a migliorarsi.</p><p>Grazie al certificato d'eccellenza rilasciato da Ethicjobs e attraverso la piattaforma web, i consumatori sapranno quali aziende fanno vivere bene i propri dipendenti, quindi sapranno quali aziende scegliere. Saranno proprio i dipendenti ad attestare questo benessere.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Perché crediamo in Ethicjobs e perché pensiamo che dovreste farlo anche voi</strong></h3><p>Crediamo profondamente nella nostra idea perché pensiamo che l'atto di finanziare, quindi acquistare, che in economia si chiama voto con il portafoglio, sia davvero un voto, una scelta da fare in maniera consapevole.</p><p>É prendendoci cura gli uni degli altri, finanziando la felicità, che si cambiano le cose.</p><p>Noi vorremmo questo, ma è solo con il vostro aiuto che riusciremo a raggiungerlo.</p><h3> </h3><h3><u><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></u></h3><p>Come abbiamo detto, gli standard della qualità del lavoro dipendente oggi sono bassi. Per nostra naturale predisposizione tendiamo ad adattarci, ma non sempre stringere i denti e sacrificare passioni, talenti, affetti, è la cosa giusta da fare.</p><p>Ethicjobs alzerà gli standard e renderà trasparente ai consumatori un passaggio della filiera storica del prodotto/servizio oggi poco in vista ma di estremo valore, quello della risorsa umana. Premierà con un certificato le aziende meritevoli, e guiderà nel percorso di crescita quelle non ancora al top.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong><u>PERCHE'DOVRESTE AIUTARCI?</u></strong></h3><p>Perché crediamo che voi abbiate il potere di finanziare la felicità, la trasparenza, il benessere, e che questo sia il modo per iniziare a farlo.</p><p>Non aiuterete solo noi e il nostro progetto, ma qualcosa di più grande, ci aiuterete a far partire il cambiamento.</p><h3> </h3><h3><u><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">COME VERRANNO UTILIZZATI I FINANZIAMENTI?</span></strong></u></h3><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I finanziamenti saranno utilizzati per la creazione  della piattaforma web e per parte della campagna di sensibilizzazione e comunicazione che vogliamo mettere in atto.</span></p><p>Queste due cose saranno quelle più importanti perché creeranno l'impatto sui consumatori, rendendoli sensibili e consapevoli, educandoli. Oltre a questo, il vostro contributo aiuterà anche altre giovani start up (dai un'occhiata ai premi).</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong><u>IL NOSTRO OBIETTIVO BASTERÁ?</u></strong></h3><p>No.</p><p>Per la campagna di sensibilizzazione/comunicazione che vogliamo fare e per quello che la piattaforma web diventerà dopo il primo anno, l'obiettivo che ci siamo posti è davvero basso e non copre i costi, ma è quello che ci sentiamo di chiedere a voi che vorremmo foste parte del progetto. Il resto lo mettiamo noi perché crediamo ciecamente nell'idea (e perché altrimenti quei lavoretti di cui parlavamo all'inizio a cosa son serviti?).</p><h3> </h3><h3><u><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">CI SONO RICOMPENSE PER CHI FINANZIA?</span></strong></u></h3><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Certamente! Le ricompense per voi che ci aiuterete ci saranno, anche se sappiamo tutti che la vera ricompensa è quella di essere parte di qualcosa che conta.</span></p><p><i>YOU SCRATCH OUR BACK AND WE'LL SCARTCH YOURS.</i></p><p>Eccole:</p><ul>

</ul><h3> </h3><h3><u><strong>RISCHI E SFIDE</strong></u></h3><p>“Se non si rischiasse mai nella vita, Michelangelo avrebbe dipinto il pavimento della Cappella Sistina, e non la volta.”</p><p>I rischi ci sono, vogliamo essere sinceri.</p><p>Ci potrebbe essere il rischio di non riuscire a far capire ai consumatori che sono loro a fare la differenza con i loro acquisti e quindi con le loro scelte. Un altro rischio potrebbe riguardare le aziende perché, pur entrando in punta di piedi, quello che si crea tra dipendenti e titolari è sempre qualcosa di molto delicato e complesso, metterci le mani è chiaramente rischioso.</p><p>Non avendo paura però i rischi si trasformano in sfide: sensibilizzare i consumatori affinché diventino consumAttori e affinché scelgano che ambienti finanziare, facendo sì che nel momento della scelta il benessere e la felicità altrui abbiano un peso, questa sarà la sfida. Coinvolgere le aziende, senza la paura di essere giudicate, facendo capire che essere etici significa essere lungimiranti, anche questa sarà una sfida.</p><p>Cambiare davvero qualcosa nella vita dei dipendenti, questa sarà quella più grande.</p><p>Se riusciremo a superare queste sfide faremo un grande passo in avanti, e voi lo farete con noi.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong><u>COME AIUTARCI?</u></strong></h3><p>Sappiamo che alcune persone, pur volendo, semplicemente non possono aiutarci economicamente. Questo non è un problema, ci potete aiutare in altri modi:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>Parlate di noi: parlate del nostro progetto con i vostri amici davanti a una birra, parlatene ai colleghi al lavoro, parlatene al vostro partner a casa. Diffondete l'idea e iniziate a pensarci. Pensate se siete felici al lavoro, o se rendete felice chi lavora per voi.</li>
<li>Spendete bene i vostri soldi:  Iniziate a chiedervi che ambienti state finanziando con i vostri acquisti, fate caso agli stati d'animo dei dipendenti che incontrate nel vostro ristorante preferito, al cinema, nei posti che scegliete. Partte dal vostro piccolo, come stiamo facendo noi. Siamo responsabili anche degli altri.</li>

All starting from a bottom-up process in which the main actors will be directly the employees which will evaluate and certificate their working conditions. Thanks to controlled anonymous evaluations we will then be able to define a reliable framework of the best companies on the market. On the other hand, Ethicjobs aims to lead consumers towards ethical and aware purchases, to become  Prosumers (or Pro-Consumers), in order to reward top class companies with all the support they deserve both in terms of higher revenues and better branding.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>History</strong></h3><p>Our story is simple. Coming from different places in Italy, our team members moved to Rimini (on the Adriatic coast) with one shared goal: to graduate. During college years our bonds got stronger as we shared much more than our study path, to the point to consider ourselves literally family. Once achieved our desired degree, instead of rushing straight to the job market to help others fulfill their dreams, we decided to make an attempt to create our own future, to make this world a better place to live, together.</p><p>We tried once, twice, but failed. We tried again, but still with no results. Surrender was just around the corner, someone started looking elsewhere, others started taking minor jobs. Until one day, at a start-up training lecture a great woman told us:</p><p>“Guys, follow your most noble dreams. Start something that follows your deepest beliefs, because only then you’ll get up every morning, work even eighteen hours and strive in front of any obstacle.”</p><p>Inspired by these words, we found ourselves asking each other again: “how could we unleash our desire to make this world a better place?”</p><p>Moreover we continued to see our friends and our colleagues, perhaps because they were less lucky or perhaps because they were less willing to fight, abandon their aspirations and dreams and accept their nine-to-five jobs; eight, nine or even ten hours a day, almost no free-time, few options, slim satisfaction.</p><p>We realized that our jobs are a crucial commitment, occupying most of our days constantly. We realized that only if we live our jobs positively we can keep the fire burning, only if our job places are serene and sheltered we can be the best version of ourselves every day.</p><p>So one night, as we were sipping a beer at a pub, the crucial problem appeared right in front of our eyes: Why can’t we create only positive and serene workplaces? Why can’t everyone wake up in the morning happy about the work day ahead of him/her?</p><p> </p><p>(…..brainstorming</p><p>brainstorming</p><p>brainstorming</p><p>brainstorming…..</p><p>ETHICJOBS!</p><p>… still a little brainstorming…)</p><p> </p><p>And finally: Ethicjobs is a spotlight for companies which seriously acknowledge the value of human capital, which put people first and consistently provide a healthy and ethical workplace. Ethicjobs will reward such companies with a certificate and will lend a (professional) hand to those companies which haven’t proved the same.</p><p>Thanks to Ethicjobs’ “Certificate of Excellence” consumers now can easily find out which companies treat their employees best, moreover which companies should be financed with his/her purchases.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Why we believe in Ethicjobs and why we think you should too.</strong></h3><p>We deeply believe in our idea since we reckon that all of us, as consumers, have one of the most powerful weapons which are our purchases. Every time we buy a good or service we are financing an employer, we are fueling his actions and behaviors, we are literally “voting” with our wallet.</p><p>It’s only by taking care of each other, by funding happiness that things can really change.</p><p>This is our will, and it can become reality with the support of all of you.</p><h3> </h3><h3><u><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></u></h3><p>As already mentioned, working standards worldwide (and especially in Italy) are low. As humans we might even have a natural tendency to adapt, but is it really worth sacrificing passions, talents or even time with your loved ones?</p><p>Ethicjobs will raise the bar by providing higher levels of transparency about one underrated ring of the supply chain: human resources. Worthy companies will be rewarded and sponsored by us as a trustful and reliable employer for its workers, meanwhile companies with lower standards will have a chance to be followed by our experts to elevate their workplace to a better place to be.</p><h3> </h3><h3><u><strong>WHY SHOULD YOU BACK US?</strong></u></h3><p>Because we believe that each and every one of you has the power to fund happiness, to provide transparency, to increase wealth; starting now.</p><p>By backing us you will give the spark to our engine, you will enable us to start working tomorrow for a shared goal.</p><p> </p><h3><u><strong>HOW WILL YOU INVEST THE FUNDINGS FROM THIS CAMPAIGN?</strong></u></h3><p>All the money raised will be invested in our web portal and in sensible communication towards consumers. Both investments are strategically crucial in order to ensure that the most possible people get to know us and eventually support our project. Moreover, backing us will indirectly show support for other young start-up companies; check our perk list to know more.</p><h3> </h3><h3><u><strong>IS YOUR GOAL SUFFICIENT?</strong></u></h3><p>No.</p><p>If we consider the whole investment for implementation and development of our online portal and communication plan for the first year the present goal is relatively low, but more than enough for us to consider all of you part of the project. We really believe in the potential of Ethicjobs, and we will be investing our own savings as well into this idea.</p><p> </p><h3><u><strong>ARE THERE ANY PERKS?</strong></u></h3><p>Of course! There are perks of any shape and size, even though everyone knows that the true reward is to be part of something important you care about.</p><p><i>YOU SCRATCH OUR BACKS AND WE'LL SCRATCH YOURS.</i></p><p>Take a look on your right and find the perk that suits you best!</p><h3> </h3><h3><u><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></u></h3><p>“If no one ever took risks, Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine floor.”               </p><p>We’ll be honest. The risk is real.</p><p>We might fail to make consumers understand that it is only them that can make the difference with their purchases and their choices or else we might fail in tackling the issues between employers and employees. But risks turn into challenges when you have the right instruments to deal with them. Consumers must realize that all of them can become Prosumers if only they are aware of the power that lays in their wallets. Companies must not fear to be judged, but should leverage on the positive impact that a better workplace would provide to its employees. In fact, without any doubt our biggest challenge is to really change something for all of them.</p><p>If we acknowledge these challenges, and work every day towards a shared goal, we can really make a change.</p><h3> </h3><h3><u><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></u></h3><p>We understand that not everyone has the possibility to show their support financially. It isn’t a problem at all; there are many ways which you can give us a huge hand:</p><ul>
<li>Spread the word: talk about us to your friends, family, colleagues and even your bosses. We must be united to make an impact.</li>
<li>Spend consciously: every time you open your wallet ask yourself really who you are financing, if it is the bar where you spend your free time, stores, agencies, anything!</li>

Attraverso le valutazioni anonime e controllate dei dipendenti stessi, si delineerà un quadro delle migliori imprese.Ethicjobs vuole sensibilizzare ed indirizzare l’utente finale verso un circuito di acquisti più etici e consapevoli, rendendolo consapevole di chi e cosa sta finanziando, aumentando di conseguenza i flussi per le realtà che riusciranno a dimostrare ed ottenere i maggiori standard di qualità del lavoro dipendente. La storiaLa nostra storia è semplice. Arriviamo da più parti d'Italia, ci incontriamo tutti a Rimini dove ci laureiamo e diventiamo grandi amici. Una volta laureati, invece di portare avanti sogni e ambizioni altrui offrendoci come dipendenti, decidiamo di provare a seguire una strada comune e realizzare un nostro sogno insieme.Proviamo con qualche idea, ma falliamo. Ci riproviamo, ma di nuovo non va.Un pochino iniziamo a cedere, chi trovi lavoro per mantenersi, chi non molla ma rallenta. Finché un giorno, ad un corso per start up, una grande donna dice: “Ragazzi, seguite i vostri scopi nobili. Mettete in piedi qualcosa che segua i vostri ideali, perché sarà allora che avrete lo stimolo e la voglia di alzarvi la mattina, lavorare 18h e continuare fiduciosi, anche davanti alle difficoltà.” Illuminati ci chiediamo come poter dar sfogo alla nostra voglia di cambiamento, ma nel frattempo continuiamo a lavorare per altri, per scopi esterni a noi.In tutto questo continuiamo a vedere i nostri colleghi più o meno grandi di noi, ma meno fortunati o meno pronti a lottare, con i loro sogni ormai in un cassetto dimenticato, vivere male il posto di lavoro, e così anche la vita.8-9-10h al giorno, poco tempo libero, poca scelta, poche soddisfazioni...Iniziamo così a capire che il lavoro è un impegno importante, riempie gran parte della nostra giornata e da lui non si fugge, capiamo che solo vivendolo bene, solo se l'ambiente che si crea all'interno è sereno, le energie e il benessere non se ne vanno, e così quelle poche ore che ci restano al di fuori possono essere altrettanto serene e belle. Scusate, ma allora perché non creare solo ambienti lavorativi sereni??E' questo che iniziamo a chiederci una sera chiacchierando davanti a una birra. (…..brainstormingbrainstormingbrainstormingbrainstorming.....ETHICJOBS!Un lampo nel cielo, Ethicjobs ci illumina come una cometa, come le parole della grande donna mesi e mesi indietro....ancora un po' di brainstorming...) Ed ecco: Ethicjobs punta i riflettori su quelle aziende che danno valore al capitale umano, che mettono al centro la persona, offrendo un ambiente lavorativo qualitativamente alto, sano, sereno ed etico. Ethicjobs premierà queste aziende e rilascerà un certificato, e aiuterà invece le quelle che non hanno ancora raggiunto questi standard a migliorarsi.Grazie al certificato d'eccellenza rilasciato da Ethicjobs e attraverso la piattaforma web, i consumatori sapranno quali aziende fanno vivere bene i propri dipendenti, quindi sapranno quali aziende scegliere. Saranno proprio i dipendenti ad attestare questo benessere. Perché crediamo in Ethicjobs e perché pensiamo che dovreste farlo anche voiCrediamo profondamente nella nostra idea perché pensiamo che l'atto di finanziare, quindi acquistare, che in economia si chiama voto con il portafoglio, sia davvero un voto, una scelta da fare in maniera consapevole.É prendendoci cura gli uni degli altri, finanziando la felicità, che si cambiano le cose.Noi vorremmo questo, ma è solo con il vostro aiuto che riusciremo a raggiungerlo. THE IMPACTCome abbiamo detto, gli standard della qualità del lavoro dipendente oggi sono bassi. Per nostra naturale predisposizione tendiamo ad adattarci, ma non sempre stringere i denti e sacrificare passioni, talenti, affetti, è la cosa giusta da fare.Ethicjobs alzerà gli standard e renderà trasparente ai consumatori un passaggio della filiera storica del prodotto/servizio oggi poco in vista ma di estremo valore, quello della risorsa umana. Premierà con un certificato le aziende meritevoli, e guiderà nel percorso di crescita quelle non ancora al top. PERCHE'DOVRESTE AIUTARCI?Perché crediamo che voi abbiate il potere di finanziare la felicità, la trasparenza, il benessere, e che questo sia il modo per iniziare a farlo.Non aiuterete solo noi e il nostro progetto, ma qualcosa di più grande, ci aiuterete a far partire il cambiamento. COME VERRANNO UTILIZZATI I FINANZIAMENTI?I finanziamenti saranno utilizzati per la creazione  della piattaforma web e per parte della campagna di sensibilizzazione e comunicazione che vogliamo mettere in atto.Queste due cose saranno quelle più importanti perché creeranno l'impatto sui consumatori, rendendoli sensibili e consapevoli, educandoli. Oltre a questo, il vostro contributo aiuterà anche altre giovani start up (dai un'occhiata ai premi). IL NOSTRO OBIETTIVO BASTERÁ?No.Per la campagna di sensibilizzazione/comunicazione che vogliamo fare e per quello che la piattaforma web diventerà dopo il primo anno, l'obiettivo che ci siamo posti è davvero basso e non copre i costi, ma è quello che ci sentiamo di chiedere a voi che vorremmo foste parte del progetto. Il resto lo mettiamo noi perché crediamo ciecamente nell'idea (e perché altrimenti quei lavoretti di cui parlavamo all'inizio a cosa son serviti?). CI SONO RICOMPENSE PER CHI FINANZIA?Certamente! Le ricompense per voi che ci aiuterete ci saranno, anche se sappiamo tutti che la vera ricompensa è quella di essere parte di qualcosa che conta.YOU SCRATCH OUR BACK AND WE'LL SCARTCH YOURS.Eccole:

 RISCHI E SFIDE“Se non si rischiasse mai nella vita, Michelangelo avrebbe dipinto il pavimento della Cappella Sistina, e non la volta.”I rischi ci sono, vogliamo essere sinceri.Ci potrebbe essere il rischio di non riuscire a far capire ai consumatori che sono loro a fare la differenza con i loro acquisti e quindi con le loro scelte. Un altro rischio potrebbe riguardare le aziende perché, pur entrando in punta di piedi, quello che si crea tra dipendenti e titolari è sempre qualcosa di molto delicato e complesso, metterci le mani è chiaramente rischioso.Non avendo paura però i rischi si trasformano in sfide: sensibilizzare i consumatori affinché diventino consumAttori e affinché scelgano che ambienti finanziare, facendo sì che nel momento della scelta il benessere e la felicità altrui abbiano un peso, questa sarà la sfida. Coinvolgere le aziende, senza la paura di essere giudicate, facendo capire che essere etici significa essere lungimiranti, anche questa sarà una sfida.Cambiare davvero qualcosa nella vita dei dipendenti, questa sarà quella più grande.Se riusciremo a superare queste sfide faremo un grande passo in avanti, e voi lo farete con noi. COME AIUTARCI?Sappiamo che alcune persone, pur volendo, semplicemente non possono aiutarci economicamente. Questo non è un problema, ci potete aiutare in altri modi: 
Parlate di noi: parlate del nostro progetto con i vostri amici davanti a una birra, parlatene ai colleghi al lavoro, parlatene al vostro partner a casa. Diffondete l'idea e iniziate a pensarci. Pensate se siete felici al lavoro, o se rendete felice chi lavora per voi.
Spendete bene i vostri soldi:  Iniziate a chiedervi che ambienti state finanziando con i vostri acquisti, fate caso agli stati d'animo dei dipendenti che incontrate nel vostro ristorante preferito, al cinema, nei posti che scegliete. Partte dal vostro piccolo, come stiamo facendo noi. Siamo responsabili anche degli altri.
Seguiteci: Ovvio!

 Grazie a voi anche altre persone potrebbero scoprire Ethicjobs e aiutarci.  [english version]Ethicjobs, BetterJobs, BetterLives. It is our honor to present to you Ethicjobs, the start-up that aims to change the job market starting from the consumers.Let’s start with an assumption: every human being on average is going to work about 14.600 days, 109.800 hours, about 15% of the time he/she has to live on this planet.Ethicjobs will create an online platform to spotlight companies which offer the highest standards in terms of job quality. All starting from a bottom-up process in which the main actors will be directly the employees which will evaluate and certificate their working conditions. Thanks to controlled anonymous evaluations we will then be able to define a reliable framework of the best companies on the market. On the other hand, Ethicjobs aims to lead consumers towards ethical and aware purchases, to become  Prosumers (or Pro-Consumers), in order to reward top class companies with all the support they deserve both in terms of higher revenues and better branding. HistoryOur story is simple. Coming from different places in Italy, our team members moved to Rimini (on the Adriatic coast) with one shared goal: to graduate. During college years our bonds got stronger as we shared much more than our study path, to the point to consider ourselves literally family. Once achieved our desired degree, instead of rushing straight to the job market to help others fulfill their dreams, we decided to make an attempt to create our own future, to make this world a better place to live, together.We tried once, twice, but failed. We tried again, but still with no results. Surrender was just around the corner, someone started looking elsewhere, others started taking minor jobs. Until one day, at a start-up training lecture a great woman told us:“Guys, follow your most noble dreams. Start something that follows your deepest beliefs, because only then you’ll get up every morning, work even eighteen hours and strive in front of any obstacle.”Inspired by these words, we found ourselves asking each other again: “how could we unleash our desire to make this world a better place?”Moreover we continued to see our friends and our colleagues, perhaps because they were less lucky or perhaps because they were less willing to fight, abandon their aspirations and dreams and accept their nine-to-five jobs; eight, nine or even ten hours a day, almost no free-time, few options, slim satisfaction.We realized that our jobs are a crucial commitment, occupying most of our days constantly. We realized that only if we live our jobs positively we can keep the fire burning, only if our job places are serene and sheltered we can be the best version of ourselves every day.So one night, as we were sipping a beer at a pub, the crucial problem appeared right in front of our eyes: Why can’t we create only positive and serene workplaces? Why can’t everyone wake up in the morning happy about the work day ahead of him/her? (…..brainstormingbrainstormingbrainstormingbrainstorming…..ETHICJOBS!… still a little brainstorming…) And finally: Ethicjobs is a spotlight for companies which seriously acknowledge the value of human capital, which put people first and consistently provide a healthy and ethical workplace. Ethicjobs will reward such companies with a certificate and will lend a (professional) hand to those companies which haven’t proved the same.Thanks to Ethicjobs’ “Certificate of Excellence” consumers now can easily find out which companies treat their employees best, moreover which companies should be financed with his/her purchases. Why we believe in Ethicjobs and why we think you should too.We deeply believe in our idea since we reckon that all of us, as consumers, have one of the most powerful weapons which are our purchases. Every time we buy a good or service we are financing an employer, we are fueling his actions and behaviors, we are literally “voting” with our wallet.It’s only by taking care of each other, by funding happiness that things can really change.This is our will, and it can become reality with the support of all of you. THE IMPACTAs already mentioned, working standards worldwide (and especially in Italy) are low. As humans we might even have a natural tendency to adapt, but is it really worth sacrificing passions, talents or even time with your loved ones?Ethicjobs will raise the bar by providing higher levels of transparency about one underrated ring of the supply chain: human resources. Worthy companies will be rewarded and sponsored by us as a trustful and reliable employer for its workers, meanwhile companies with lower standards will have a chance to be followed by our experts to elevate their workplace to a better place to be. WHY SHOULD YOU BACK US?Because we believe that each and every one of you has the power to fund happiness, to provide transparency, to increase wealth; starting now.By backing us you will give the spark to our engine, you will enable us to start working tomorrow for a shared goal. HOW WILL YOU INVEST THE FUNDINGS FROM THIS CAMPAIGN?All the money raised will be invested in our web portal and in sensible communication towards consumers. Both investments are strategically crucial in order to ensure that the most possible people get to know us and eventually support our project. Moreover, backing us will indirectly show support for other young start-up companies; check our perk list to know more. IS YOUR GOAL SUFFICIENT?No.If we consider the whole investment for implementation and development of our online portal and communication plan for the first year the present goal is relatively low, but more than enough for us to consider all of you part of the project. We really believe in the potential of Ethicjobs, and we will be investing our own savings as well into this idea. ARE THERE ANY PERKS?Of course! There are perks of any shape and size, even though everyone knows that the true reward is to be part of something important you care about.YOU SCRATCH OUR BACKS AND WE'LL SCRATCH YOURS.Take a look on your right and find the perk that suits you best! RISKS AND CHALLENGES“If no one ever took risks, Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine floor.”               We’ll be honest. The risk is real.We might fail to make consumers understand that it is only them that can make the difference with their purchases and their choices or else we might fail in tackling the issues between employers and employees. But risks turn into challenges when you have the right instruments to deal with them. Consumers must realize that all of them can become Prosumers if only they are aware of the power that lays in their wallets. Companies must not fear to be judged, but should leverage on the positive impact that a better workplace would provide to its employees. In fact, without any doubt our biggest challenge is to really change something for all of them.If we acknowledge these challenges, and work every day towards a shared goal, we can really make a change. OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPWe understand that not everyone has the possibility to show their support financially. It isn’t a problem at all; there are many ways which you can give us a huge hand:
Spread the word: talk about us to your friends, family, colleagues and even your bosses. We must be united to make an impact.
Spend consciously: every time you open your wallet ask yourself really who you are financing, if it is the bar where you spend your free time, stores, agencies, anything!
Follow us: obviously!

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">What
is Linda's Place?</span><br/>
</h4>
<p>I envision Linda's Place to be a recovery center that will be the
first in what will eventually be a chain of centers across the United States.
The center will have an open-door, drop-in policy. This will be a place to go
to escape the insanity and regain some peace. Education through workshops and
seminars, unconventional programs such as culinary arts, creative writing,
career counseling, and social events will also be offered. Professional
counselors will be available for one-on-one as well as group counseling. Peer
groups with a drop-in, drop-out theme will be on-going throughout the day so
that clients can come into the group at a time convenient to them. On-site
child care will allow the clients to attend without worrying about what to do
with the kids. </p>
<p>In the future Linda’s Place will expand to include loved ones of
those who are drug addicted. Some programs will be drug specific rather than
alcohol specific while clients may attend any of the workshops and seminars.</p>
<p>A residential program is planned for our future development. We
will offer a 3, 4 or 5 day in-house program. There will be no locked-down
units. However, for the safety of our clients no one under the influence of
alcohol or drugs will be allowed on the property. This program will be in
effect when we have secured funding to purchase appropriate facilities.</p>
<h4>How
will my contribution be used?</h4>
<p>This campaign is the first step in making Linda's Place a reality.
 The funds generated here will cover attorney fees; cost of possibly becoming
a non-profit; marketing and publicity; fundraising events; securing
office/meeting space; furniture, equipment and supplies; and, general set-up
expenses.</p>
<h4>Frightening
statistics</h4>
<p>With statistics like the ones below, it is clear the time for a
recovery center for families is NOW.</p>
<p>1)  A 2008 Center for Disease Control's study shows that
excessive drinking costs taxpayers 223.5 BILLION dollars. I’m sure that
eight years later the cost to taxpayers has increased substantially.  Although the center will not be designed to
stop alcoholics from drinking, it will aide in lowering the cost by providing
assistance to families so that they can live a more productive life without
assistance from the government.</p>
<p>2)  There are thousands of treatment centers in the United States,
but I could find no statistics on how many offer an extensive family program. I
also could not find any treatment centers that are exclusive to the families of
addicted persons. Recovery is focused on the abuser and not the silent, invisible
persons caught in their choas. </p>
<p>3)  It is sad to know that according to a 2012 survey,
10% of all US children live with an alcoholic. Addiction, drug or alcohol,
is a disease that can run in families. If we can save even one child from
perpetuating the addiction, the center will have proven its value. Linda's
Place can provide the parent with tools on how to survive the devastating
affects of alcoholism and drug addiction. The need is overwhelming and urgent.</p>
<p>Of course there are
risks. I’m sure all the established rehab centers in the area will consider
themselves as competition for Linda’s Place. But with proper outreach to those
centers, we can find it advantageous to work together rather than at odds.<br/>Money is only one of
the things that we desperately need to get Linda’s Place open. Spreading the
word and sharing this contribution opportunity with your contacts will go a
long way in making this campaign a success. Volunteered services for legal,
financial, and public relations advice are very valuable. Materials and
supplies, books and videos, are all welcomed and appreciated. Positive comments
and suggestions will help keep the momentum and excitement at a high note.</p>

 exciting, but never as exciting as what what they do for people; where 
we don't define what a cyclist should be, but rather open up the 
possibilities of what she or he could be; a place where 
retail goes beyond the simple exchange of goods and services for payment, and 
becomes a hub and heart of community.<br/><br/>In creating this new space, we will pay tribute to our
history as cycling advocates while also renewing our present and ever 
more urgent mission: to carve out a space in our congested neighborhoods
 and in our hurried and isolated lives to bring together cyclists of all kinds -- new, experienced and would-be, moms &amp; dads, teens, children and grandparents -- to create, share and enjoy community. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Our History</h3>
<p>We have a long history of serving the needs of the Chicago's cycling community. In 1994 we opened an alternative urban bicycle store, which is often credited for being the 
first home to the nascent urban bike culture in Chicago. At the time, the idea came out of frustration that our industry failed to recognize the fantastic potential of bicycles for urban transportation. Bicycle shops treated utilitarian cyclists like second-class customers, and virtually every bike on the market had to be significantly modified to optimize it for street use. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We seized this opportunity and set about creating a store that would invite, not intimidate the 
beginner, listen, not preach to the curious, and salute, not marginalize
 the commuter.  <br/></p>
<p>In over two decades we had the privilege of 
interacting with thousands of customers, who brought us their dreams of independent travel. Each had a vision of doing 
something extraordinary, something that maybe others thought could not 
be done. They came to trust us to understand and validate their dreams, 
and help make them real.</p>

<li>An open bicycle repair area that encourages communication between technicians and customers.</li>
<li>Sufficient number of repair bays to ensure quick turn-around in peak season.</li>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We are the only coffee company in America devoted to offering all four remaining major coffee species under one roof: Arabica, Robusta, Liberica and Excelsa. We specialize in the rare and extraordinary, like our Nicaragua Catimor variety, Laos Bourbon, and Sparrow Arabica, a single origin coffee unique to Vietnam. Our top-selling coffee is produced in Dota Tarrazu, a region that used to be one of the most prolific in Costa Rica but is today suffering from a number of setbacks. We buy all of our coffee through 100% Direct Trade with the farmer, eliminating brokers, co-ops and the commodities market.</p>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>We are once again expanding the land available for our farmer to continue his work (it will be our third expansion). This is a project with impact investing potential for many areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-introduction of a once-great heirloom species of Specialty Coffee</li>
<li>Reducing poverty and improving living conditions in a disadvantaged area with a great coffee-growing heritage</li>
<li>Establishment of a wildlife refuge for study and enjoyment of natural beauty</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only can we improve the local community by supporting the re-cultivation of a wonderful coffee, but we can also ""export"" these plantings, knowledge, and techniques to other locations in Central American, having a lasting impact on thousands of lives. We can also protect a key location on the migratory path of endangered species and provide habitat for hundreds of indigenous plant species.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The first phase of this project is to improve access to the new land and begin the plantings on about 10-15 acres of this 45-acre property. The farmer has 15,000 seedlings in his nursery that need to be put in the ground this season. Getting the farm to a producing stage with 2-3 seasons will be key to making it self-sustaining with revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently the land needs path and road improvements to be able to move materials around and terrace the farm acreage. We need small all-terrain vehicles to traverse the difficult wet areas during the rainy season. This is the initial goal of this project... to have it cultivated and planted this season.</li>
<li>The Villalobos heirloom coffee is already in (limited) production on previous acreage; we can offer immediate rewards to supporters who love premium specialty coffee, as well as deferred rewards to any supporters who would like to follow this project through to its later stages of development</li>
<li>This project exceeds our ability to fund alone, which is why we have come to Indiegogo. But whatever funds we raise, whether they reach this goal or not, will be added to our own support to make good things happen in developing the farm and wildlife refuge.</li>
</ul>
<p>To thank you for your support, we have a number of Perks to interest <strong>coffee lovers, coffee shops and tradespeople, supporters interested in the wildlife preservation program, people who would mostly like to visit the area and be a part of the activities there, or supporters who simply would like to follow the project as it develops</strong>. Some rewards are immediate, and some earn Points that can be redeemed for visits to the farm and attendance in programs. Points can be added to at a later time for larger stays or programs at the farm.</p>

<h3>An Out-Sized Impact</h3>
<p>La Roya is a coffee leaf rust disease causing widespread crop loss and poverty in Central America. Our farmer in Costa Rica uses a comprehensive set of ecologically sound practices that make his varieties resistant to the leaf rust. And in the last three years he has embarked on a project to bring back the heirloom subspecies of Arabica called Villalobos, a coffee with a superb, chocolatey taste profile and excellence resistance to the leaf rust at high altitudes.</p>
<p>With our assistance and support over the last 5 years, our farmer has expanded his farmland and enhanced his processing technique to become a model farm - possibly the first zero-carbon farm in the region. Operating in a decentralized manner frees him from dependence on local co-ops and brokers who currently operate in a way that keep the region’s farmers in perpetual debt and poverty.</p>
<p>By purchasing our farmer’s crops at Direct Trade prices far above what other sources offer, we enable him to expand his work and provide employment at higher wages to dozens of residents in this small county. Our financial support helps children realize the dream of higher education, and can help establish medical and other community services where there are none. And linking coffee production with wildlife preservation is a practice that has been very successful in South America and can provide a wonderful model moving forward for this region.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Decentralizing Coffee Production and Sale</h3>
<p>Few coffee consumers realize that by engaging in Direct Trade with small farmers, it's possible for the purchase of one bag of coffee to have a significant impact in the world. Coffee as a commodity ranks second only to oil. Where we fill up our gas tank has little impact on people's lives or the environment, but where we buy our coffee does.</p>
<p>Regional coffee co-ops and brokers no longer serve a helpful function to small farmers; in fact, the relationship is best described as predatory. Portable coffee mills and better processing techniques help farmers free themselves from these predators by enabling them to process their coffee locally, instead of hauling it, at high cost, to expensive remote mills. <strong>In our video below, you can see our farmer using his simple and inexpensive portable milling machine.</strong> It is mounted on a trailer that allows it to be toted from farm to farm, sharing the benefit of the machine with neighboring farmers and increasing its impact on the entire region:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bn4VYg2BiAQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div><ul>
<li>Farmers who rely on regional co-ops and distant mills make less than 5% as much profit on their crops. And ""fair trade"" only guarantees a small differential over what these sources offer. <strong>Direct Trade lets the farmer set his own price and receive 10-20X more profit, </strong>enabling them to invest in their farms and provide better education and health care for their children and workers, and helping to keep farming communities whole</li>
<li>Having the ability to mill on their own land cuts costs considerably, and raises the quality of the coffee. Pride in producing Specialty Coffee quality is a wonderful motivator and reward.</li>
</ul></div>
<h3>Future Developments</h3>
<p>As the new farm becomes self-sufficient, we will erect buildings to support the farmer's educational programs, community resources, and wildlife studies and projects. Supporters can be rewarded with guest lodging in this beautiful mountain region for attendance in programs or just for the fun of visiting the coffee farm and wildlife refuge. Currently the farmer is operating several of these programs, such as his ""Seed to Green"" course in which attendees participate in all stages of coffee farming, but he needs more facilities to be able to offer and host more activities. The future is brighter for Dota, Tarrazu!</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We are a team of two who love coffee. Hardy Helburn and Sarvesh Makthal Founded Bright Light Coffee in New York City so more people try the freshest, best tasting coffee around. We've been roasting on a small scale for years, and in the past 6 months began distributing samples to friends and family. We have gotten a tremendous response. This campaign will take us to the next level by either securing us a spot with a local roasting co-op or setting up our our roastery in Westchester County, New York. Extensive experience in consumer products, engineering and business development is helping us put together the right ingredients to make some wonderful tasting coffee!</p>
<h3>What is good coffee?</h3>
<p>The answer, surprisingly, depends on whom you ask. Some people swear by their cans of ground coffee while others must have their daily fix of low-fat-skinny-vanilla-frap before doing anything in the day. We are creatures of habit and most of us like to maintain a routine that we have kept for years. If it isn't broken, why fix it? </p>
<p>But the coffee you have been drinking is burnt, and you probably didn't realize it. You're not alone. Coffee companies and consumers alike have been driving this trend. You may love your ""dark roast,"" or you may want to try something different and not even know it.</p>
<p>For years coffee companies have been getting bigger and striven to offer beans of uniform flavor and quality across the market. Coffee is an organic product and it doesn't all taste the same. Some beans are fruity, some nutty, some taste sweet and some just boring. Many coffee companies offer a uniform product by over-roasting.</p>
<p>Dark Coffee might make sense when you're adding cream, sugar or hazelnut syrup but that may not really be necessary. It turns out coffee beans have a great natural sweetness, a delicious richness, and a nuttiness that many haven't discovered yet.</p>
<p>We were in a similar boat before we discovered 3rd wave coffee, the style that has risen in the past decade highlighting the natural and often subtle qualities of a coffee bean. As we explored this wonderful new world of coffee, we realized that it was also too complicated to enjoy consistently. </p>
<p>Our way is simple: We source our beans from growers who share our passion for quality. Our beans are roasted just enough to bring out the sweetest, most delicious flavors. To achieve consistency, we work extra hard to pick beans that everyone will love - sweet, clean tasting beans that will taste like COFFEE every time.  We ship our coffee the second it's cool so it will always be the freshest cup around. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’ve fine-tuned the signature Bright Light coffee style and identified great beans. We need funding in order to build out our own or access an existing roastery.</p>
<p>If we meet our funding goal, we will join a local commercial roasting co-op and use their equipment to roast top-quality beans.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we will consider investing in our own roasting equipment and building our own roaster.</p>
