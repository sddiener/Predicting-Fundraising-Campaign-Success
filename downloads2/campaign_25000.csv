<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A new musical with songs by Buck Evans and  book by </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em; text-align: right;"">Dennis Nyback  </span>
</h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In
1994 I wrote the musical review “Can't We Be Friends.” It was
performed for two weeks in Seattle.  It featured the stories , and
the music, of women who wrote popular songs in the Twenties and
Thirties. Continuing on that theme in 1998, living in New York, I
worked on the  American Masters documentary Yours for a Song:  The
Women of Tin Pan Alley. It aired nationally on PBS in 1999.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Then
I began working on The Past is Calling.  It was a more ambitious
undertaking than anything I'd done before.  Just as I was inspired by
songwriters Kay Swift, Dana Suesse, and Vee Lawnhurst to produce
Can't We Be Friends; the songwriter Buck Evans inspired me to write The Past is Calling.  I met Buck in college.  He moved to
Alaska.  I moved to New York.  I listened to his songs on homemade
cassette tapes he'd send me.  The story of the Past is Calling came to me as I listened to
the the songs. 
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The play takes place largely in 1926; right in the middle of
the Jazz Age.  A problem with setting a musical play at that era is

A new musical with songs by Buck Evans and  book by Dennis Nyback  
In
1994 I wrote the musical review “Can't We Be Friends.” It was
performed for two weeks in Seattle.  It featured the stories , and
the music, of women who wrote popular songs in the Twenties and
Thirties. Continuing on that theme in 1998, living in New York, I
worked on the  American Masters documentary Yours for a Song:  The
Women of Tin Pan Alley. It aired nationally on PBS in 1999.
Then
I began working on The Past is Calling.  It was a more ambitious
undertaking than anything I'd done before.  Just as I was inspired by
songwriters Kay Swift, Dana Suesse, and Vee Lawnhurst to produce
Can't We Be Friends; the songwriter Buck Evans inspired me to write The Past is Calling.  I met Buck in college.  He moved to
Alaska.  I moved to New York.  I listened to his songs on homemade
cassette tapes he'd send me.  The story of the Past is Calling came to me as I listened to
the the songs. 

The play takes place largely in 1926; right in the middle of
the Jazz Age.  A problem with setting a musical play at that era is
it is very hard for modern songwriters to write period music without 
it sounding forced at best or phony at worst.  Buck has worked for
years to capture the natural style of Tin Pan Alley composers.  It is
his genius that makes this play possible.  How ambitious is it?  The
Past is Calling features an original story.  It is much more common
for musicals to be made by adding songs to a previous work.  A
musical that grows from songs is a  rare thing.  
The world premiere of The Past is Calling will be in January 24-26 in Portland as part of the ten day long Fertile Ground Festival of new works. If it is done right it will later be mounted for longer runs at larger venues. Just as Can't We Be Friends in Seattle resulted in a nationally aired PBS documentary; my hope is The Past is Calling will eventually make it to Broadway.

Tallulah Bankhead finds herself seated at a bar in what 
                        appears to be a formerly elegant old city hotel, now 
                        somewhat run to seed. Young and handsome Charles the 
                        bartender is there with her, supplying her every wish in 
                        the way of alcoholic refreshments.  They are soon 
                        joined by Cole Porter, Bea Lillie and                         
                        Noël Coward, and 
                        then Ethel Merman comes wandering in, followed by Judy

<p><strong>The story begins…</strong></p>
<p>The story begins when one woman crossed the Wyoming border on a cross country bike trip. At that moment her long held dream of beginning a theatre for women and girls became crystallized.  When she returned to Tampa, <strong><em>Powerstories Theatre</em></strong> was born and the first show “Let the Stories Move You” performed in 2000 to sold out audiences!</p>
<p><strong>The rising action…</strong></p>
<p>Working out of “whatever” space they could find to rehearse and do workshops, Powerstories provided at least 20,000 individuals the opportunity to perform in an original story concert, learn how to seek and speak true stories, or attended one of the many original productions. In the past 12 months alone, over 1400 youth attended free shows performed by middle school girls, and 240 young girls received theatre and leadership workshops.</p>
<p><strong>The leading question of the story…</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Where do you your thing?</em></strong> It became clear after 12 years that Powerstories needed to find a home! So, volunteers and staff began the search and an amazing space was found to put down roots.  A 1,000 square foot facility with high ceilings in a GREAT and very visible location on a bus route was found.</p>
<p>This is it. The big chance. The step up. We have always dreamed of operating out of a space that will allow rehearsals, workshops and … and…this is the BIG DREAM…the opportunity to do our OWN season of shows!  We'll also be able to offer performing and rehearsal space to other theater groups in the Tampa Bay area.</p>
<p>It’s amazing…and thrilling…and we need your help to make our dreams a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Our next <em>important</em> chapter…</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to create an intimate performance space (30 seats max). This performance space will be quickly convertible from the more usual rehearsal/class room space of the facility taking little time, labor and storage space.</p>
<p>To that end, we have designed a system of walk along traveler curtain track that allows curtains and masking to be stored in a completely out of the way position along the walls of the room.  Theatrical lighting that can be kept in place and is simple to use for instructors and students alike. A uniform theatrical vinyl surface that will serve both as an appropriate floor for classes and performance.  Comfortable and lightweight folding chairs and easily movable seating risers complete the convertible facility.</p>
<p>The conversion into a performance space should take two people as little as 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the materials and equipment required for this project are easily installed and when the time comes for the organization to move to larger quarters much of the investment can be recouped and easily moved to a larger space.</p>
<p><strong>BUDGET</strong></p>
<p>It is estimated that the entire budget for the conversion will be less than $15,000.00.  With the addition of professional design and consulting fees and a suitable contingency the total budget should be under $19,000.00</p>
<p><strong>SEATING - $2100</strong></p>
<p>We have specified the KI/DuraMesh folding chair.  These chairs are a durable professional black, meeting all interior standards (California Fire Standards), featuring a breathable mesh seat and poly back. A lightweight tubular steel frame allows for easy set-up and take-down while providing safe and sturdy support. DuraMesh chairs are easy to fold, rearrange and transport. They lock together in rows as code requires and for a lightweight folding chair are remarkably comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>SEATING RISERS - $1000</strong></p>
<p>We have specified custom risers that fit the exact needs of the space. Two 3’x 8’ risers with an elevation of 6” and two 3’x8’ risers with an elevation of 1’.  These will have fire rated indoor/outdoor carpet tops to cut down on foot and chair noise; built in hand grips for ease of movement and will be finished inside and out with fire retardant paint.</p>
<p><strong>FLOORING - $1750</strong></p>
<p>We have specified TIMESTEP flooring for the performance area. TIMESTEP is a heavy duty multi-purpose flooring, ideally suited for all movement activities including ballet, tap, theatrical, jazz, modern, ballroom, and character. This flooring handles heavy scenery and props. As TIMESTEP is an industry standard, additional flooring may be acquired.</p>
<p><strong>LIGHTING SYSTEM - $2600</strong></p>
<p>New LED lighting technology allows a relatively low cost/ highly versatile design for this multipurpose space. Eight wash units each with 151 highly efficient LED’s allow for different lighting ""looks"", only consumes 20W and  have an approx. 50,000 hour bulb life. Three spot units with 61 LED’s each will provide versatility and lighting “specials”, only consumes 8W. Lighting is remotely controlled through industry standard protocol DMX 512 allowing for control of intensity/color via a remote controller</p>
<p>The controller specified is CHAUVET  Stage Designer 50. This controller takes the size of a 24-channel dimming console and the functionality of a 48- channel console combining them into one powerful dimming unit. Stage Designer™ 50 has up to 8 pages with 12 scenes each and 96,000 programmable steps. The console allows user to re-assign channels as needed, will be suitable for use with additional LED fixtures.</p>
<p><strong>CURTAIN SYSTEM - $6100(entire package)</strong></p>
<p>An elaborate but simple curtain system designed for quick and easy conversion into a theatrical space has been accomplished with a system of walk along traveler tracks that divide up the room storing flat against walls. The design allows for “light proof” entrances for audience and performers. Curtains will be opaque 22 oz Encore velour (Inherently Fire Retardant) sewn with 100W% fullness.  Walk along track is industry standard track from ADC.</p>

<h3>What Our Project Is About</h3>
<p>This funding project is setup to help The Carbon Schuylkill Community Theater (CSCT) to meet our goal of raising money in order to rent an Audrey II (large venus fly trap type of plant) for our production of Little Shop of Horrors.  We are a very small and new community theatre and therefore we do not have a large amount of funding.  This is our first time doing a mainstreamed or named production here at CSCT.  So, we really need to be able to raise these funds in order to make it a successful event.  This show is the spring board which we hope to use to propell CSCT into the world of great community theatres.  We want to be able to expand ourselves in both quality and technical delivery of the shows we perform.  This $500.00 would help to make Little Shop a large success, and if we can raise this we hope that this show can help us to put The Carbon Schuylkill Community Theater on the map and establish ourselves a name in the area.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This 500 dollars will be going primarily towards the puppet which costs a little over 300 to rent.  The rest of the money will be put towards the set pieces that we still need to construct, costuming that needs to be finished, and props which will beed to be purchased.  </p>
<p>If you help us to fund raise we have 6 different levels of support that you could choose from.   Any one of them would be greatly appreciated.  We cannot offer huge perks as we are so small, but we are offering some pretty unique and exciting perks for what we can afford to give away.  </p>
<p>If we do not reach our full 500 dollar goal we will put whatever money we get toward the rental of the Audrey II puppets. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is the turning point and is important to us in producing the musical.   With out your support we won't have the full funds to make this show work.  A lot of other theatres on here are looking for a few thousand to fund whole seasons, but we just simply need this money to get through the end of this season and through this show.  </p>
<p>As previously stated, this show can really be a spring board for CSCT into the Carbon and Schuylkill counties of Pennsylvania as well as other surounding counties.  We feel this is vitally important because there is not a lot of quality theatre in our area for people to be able to view.  If we would become a bigger theatre we believe that theatre can make a come back in the Carbon and schuylkill counties.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot afford even 5 dollars we could use your help to simply spread the word about our campaign.  We are only asking for $500.00 total, but more would be amazingly gracious.  As much money as we can raise can help us in a great way so even if you can't contribute please spread the word to other theatre lovers who you know.  Also, come out and support the show August 3rd at 7pm and August 4th at 2 PM at the Lehighton Borough Annex Auditorium, 110 N 3rd Street Lehighton, PA .</p>

</div></div>","What Our Project Is About
This funding project is setup to help The Carbon Schuylkill Community Theater (CSCT) to meet our goal of raising money in order to rent an Audrey II (large venus fly trap type of plant) for our production of Little Shop of Horrors.  We are a very small and new community theatre and therefore we do not have a large amount of funding.  This is our first time doing a mainstreamed or named production here at CSCT.  So, we really need to be able to raise these funds in order to make it a successful event.  This show is the spring board which we hope to use to propell CSCT into the world of great community theatres.  We want to be able to expand ourselves in both quality and technical delivery of the shows we perform.  This $500.00 would help to make Little Shop a large success, and if we can raise this we hope that this show can help us to put The Carbon Schuylkill Community Theater on the map and establish ourselves a name in the area.

<p><span>REBECCA'S HISTORY: Choreographer, dancer, actor, and instructor, Rebecca has traveled throughout Canada, the United States, Europe, and Australia to strengthen her choreography skills and further her experience within the industry. Training within ADAPT Syllabus for dance, as well with a professional performance company 'The Young Canadians of the Calgary Stampede' for over 12 years, Rebecca comes from a very technical background. In dance, her main focus is on contemporary and hip-hop, but she enrolls herself in many other styles including breaking, popping, ballet, tap, acro, plus. </span><br/><span>Rebecca has showcased her choreography in music videos for artists such as Lights “Timing is Everything”, Classified and MUGZ. Her strong and diversified technical background allows Rebecca to work within many fields in the industry. Rebecca has coached children in performance and acting for the Stampede Talent Competition, and has now moved on to adjudicating dance competitions, including Kiwanis Dance Festival. </span><span>Teaching since 2004, Rebecca has won choreography awards in competitions around the country. Her energy does not go unnoticed, and she puts everything into each experience. Rebecca Reinhart has also since branched out into other areas of the performance industry. Through her involvement as Assistant Director and Assistant Producer for KOKUS Productions, Rebecca has choreographed for, and performed in, shows such as ‘The Bazaar’, ‘Talent Defined’, ‘Toronto's Fringe Festival', plus. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>This video is mainly about agape love - covenant love of god for humans, as well as the human reciprocal love for god. The term extends to the love of ones fellow man. (""You would die for them""). The other types of love included are Philia - friendship or brotherhood, &amp; Eros - sexual nature.  Mixing nature, dancing, and sexuality, the dance is meant to show intensity - different moments in love - the ups the downs, the growth. Scenes will be interconnected to each other (showing that the type of love can change in any moment and grow together to form the highest strength in their lives together)</span></p>
<p><br/>LOCATIONS: Cottage Country and a Studio </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have been creating and building this idea for over a year - with many attempts that just didn't stick. I am ready for this one to stick and for me to build the appropriate cast and crew. With inspiration from music videos, live shows, dancers, movement, and the music, I would like to create my own 'dance music video' to share and touch masses of people on the beautiful subject love through dance and movement. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am attempting to raise around $1000 for this project. Dancers usually work for free - and we (dancers &amp; choreographers) have been attempting to create jobs and situations where all cast and crew can get paid. Coming from simply a moment of inspiration, I will need some help raising the cash for the weekend away filming. </p>
<p>The set is at a cottage in 'cottage country'. I will be needing to rent a vehicle for the crew ranging from $225-$599.97. Supply food and snacks for a crew of 5-8 people ranging from $300-$500. I have a camera already but will need to rent lighting for around $1000 itself. </p>
<p>I just want to show the love!!!!! I think we all need to realize the different types of love that can keep frienships, families, and lovers together. Love can cause so many emotions (great and unnerving), and I just believe we should all focus on the amazing emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>The funds, whether fully rasied or not, will go towards all expenses necassary to make this project come to life. Any amount of money will help these not so full artist pockets of mine (One day when my pockets are more full, I will be searching and donating to eager artists like myself).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dance is a form of art that can, with the use of music, inspire any individual. As artists we are here to make people feel. Feel greatness, feel the 'pain of life' as some of us say. Life is so much more than just a simple day to day experience -there are people, situations and emotions that fill the moments in our lives with beauty. I want to showcase a love that has inspired me to be a better person. I believe in spreading love to everyone and every situation, in any type of love (agape, philia, or eros). </p>
<p>I want to simply make people feel. Feel, remember, and emote the expereinces they have, or have had, with someone special (whether it be a friend, spouse or family member). </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you believe in love and this project, feel free to pass this info along to someone who may be interested in helping. I am all about great people and support! I can't wait to be in the position to help a fellow artist out with their dreams. Step by step 'ooh baby' we can do this!</p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Our Mission:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Spindle City Players is a small theatrical group located in Cohoes, NY. We were created to ensure students, of the Capital District of New York, access to a free quality theater arts education program. This program is not only to teach students how to perform on stage and recite lines. Our students leave knowing how to write an original show, design and create a costume, build a prop, design a set and the many other technical aspects of theater. This group will also be giving back to their community through various community service outside of the productions. Our group is also here to support each other. If someone is having a bad day we are all available to help talk it out. We believe it takes a village to raise a child, but that a child may also raise a village. Please support us in our dream to make the Spindle City Players' experience the best that it can be.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Who we are: </span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Marisa Ledesma-Henry and Ryan McCormick founded the Spindle City Players originally called the Cohoes Youth Performing Arts Foundation in August of 2012 after major funding cuts were made to the performing arts budgets of schools in the Capital District. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>Marisa Ledesma-Henry</strong>, a graduate of Cohoes High School (1999) and an alumnae of Wagner College’s musical theater performance program, has worked in the theater industry for over 30 years with the New York State Theater Institute, Capital Repertory Theater, Park Playhouse, Highlight Acting Troupe, STAR, the Whole Village Theater and Young Actors Guild. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>Ryan McCormick</strong> is a junior at Cohoes High School and has been a part of productions with the Cohoes City School District, Highlight Acting Troupe, Young Actors Guild, Troy Actors Guild and C-R Kids. Ryan decided to expand his theater range and learn about all the workings behind the scenes. Prior to Spindle City Players, Ryan has been working as the lighting designer at the Cohoes High School, an Assistant Stage Manager for the past four years with C-R Productions at the Cohoes Music Hall, and most recently held the position of Stage Manager for the Cohoes Music Hall's C-R Kid's productions of <em>15 Reasons NOT To Be In A Play </em>and Disney’s<em> Sleeping Beauty</em>. </span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>The groups premiere production, <em>The Nannylogues,</em> was written and created for our group by Marisa Ledesma-Henry. Marisa created the basic theme and character outlines, which the cast then further developed into a series of transitional monologues. Because the actors had a role in developing their own characters, those characters became more personal allowing them to more deeply embrace the true essence of each character. Throughout the pre-performance production the actors' creative writing skills excelled.  The production development and rehearsals lasted for three months culminating in a two night run. The dinner theater production opened on February 1, 2013 with a second performance on February 2nd, at Shawn P’s Restaurant at the Van Schaick Country Club and was a major success!</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Murder on the Green:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Murder on the Green is a murder mystery that revolves around the mysterious death of The Van Schaick Island Country Club’s President, Dick Van Schaick. The mayhem and confusion among the many suspects and the conflicts in their alibis lead the audience on an interactive chase as they get be deputy detectives to the performance's own Detective Max Remsen. Who at the Country Club wanted Van Schaick dead? It could be the down-to-earth gardener, Jane Wison, who cares more about her plants than people, or the too often criticized Top Chef, Roberta Clemmons. Maybe the award winning swimmer, Trixie Lane, or the ex-pro golf player, Chip Spaulding did the deed. Perhaps the murder was committed by the trophy wife, Vivian, the high school sweetheart ex, Tiffany Paris or the club treasurer's daughter, Penelope Handle. The audience will get to ask questions of all the personalities, and in the end guide Det. Remsen toward the culprit. The show is expected to open in mid November at the Van Schaick Country Club. This production will be a dinner theater, but this time the audience is a large </span><span>part of the show. It's a killer! </span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Our Goal:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We must raise $1500 to continue our program for all of our students. We do NOT charge  our students a fee to be a part of our productions but instead depend upon fundraisers, ticket sales, underwriters and donations from the general public to carry on this amazing program.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>When we reach our goal of the whole $1500, we can move forward in the process of becoming an official non-profit educational based organization.

<p>This organization was founded in 2009 after I was invited to create an event in my city. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I was originally looking for something fun to do while losing weight and I came across YouTube videos and </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">DVD's teaching the ""Thriller"" dance as part of a global event called Thrill The World. It's an annual worldwide event where people come together to </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">dance simultaneously in tribute to Michael Jackson for world records and for charity.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">After registering New York, I followed the advice of the Thrill The World website and reached out to see if anyone was interested. I was surprised by the amount of Michael Jackson fans who wanted to partake in this adventure. After he died on June 25th, what started as a fun </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Halloween community event quickly turned into a legacy. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Since 2009, w</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">e have successfully raised awareness and support for various charitable organizations such as VH1 Save The Music, UNICEF, Boomer Esiason Foundation, Eve Ensler's V-Day Campaign and One Billion Rising, and our favorite charity </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Pajama Program where we collect new pajamas and new children's books for kids in need. We have performed all over New York City being featured in movies, parades (We led the 7th Annual Dance Parade this year), and contributed classes to various schools and community centers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And now every year, we have participants who join us all over the world to participate in our New York City event. Over 500 people registered in 2009 and the list just keeps on getting bigger which means we need a bigger venue and better equipment, all of which costs money. So we really need your support to help us reach our goals!</span></p>

See the lady with the Statue of Liberty hat, that's me. My name is Amada Anderson and I am the director of a non-profit organization called Thrill The World NYC.
This organization was founded in 2009 after I was invited to create an event in my city. I was originally looking for something fun to do while losing weight and I came across YouTube videos and DVD's teaching the ""Thriller"" dance as part of a global event called Thrill The World. It's an annual worldwide event where people come together to dance simultaneously in tribute to Michael Jackson for world records and for charity.
After registering New York, I followed the advice of the Thrill The World website and reached out to see if anyone was interested. I was surprised by the amount of Michael Jackson fans who wanted to partake in this adventure. After he died on June 25th, what started as a fun Halloween community event quickly turned into a legacy. 
Since 2009, we have successfully raised awareness and support for various charitable organizations such as VH1 Save The Music, UNICEF, Boomer Esiason Foundation, Eve Ensler's V-Day Campaign and One Billion Rising, and our favorite charity The Pajama Program where we collect new pajamas and new children's books for kids in need. We have performed all over New York City being featured in movies, parades (We led the 7th Annual Dance Parade this year), and contributed classes to various schools and community centers.
And now every year, we have participants who join us all over the world to participate in our New York City event. Over 500 people registered in 2009 and the list just keeps on getting bigger which means we need a bigger venue and better equipment, all of which costs money. So we really need your support to help us reach our goals!




How much do we need?
We need close to about $1500.00 to support our October 2013 goals. Not only are we performing at our event on October 26th but we are also participating in the 40th Annual Halloween Parade. The approximate breakdown of the costs are as follows:

Insurance certificates ($300+)
Permits (park $25 + $45 sound permit)
Speaker System (being donated by DJ Kasper, but we would like to give him a tip for his time) ($100)
Generator Equipment ($120+ including gas for both 10/26 & 10/31)
Truck Rental ($200+ including gas to and from city for both 10/26 & 10/31)
Toll Fees ($60 to and from the city for both 10/26 & 10/31)
Dance rehearsal space $400 for all classes ($20 an hour x 2 hours x 100)

Water Bottles for our dancers ($40 for both events)
Table and chair rentals ($150+)

If we raise over budget, this will definitely help because any funds our campaign receives will be charged 6.75% by Indiegogo. We can use left-over funds to go towards next year's events.

<h3>Who we are &amp; where we come from...</h3>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px;"">Hello there! My name is Dulcey Fuqua. I am the dance director of Old Dominion Performance Arts Studio in Waynesboro, VA.  Our community is small and our studio is small, but our dancers have more passion than most people I know. We all work very hard and make one big family! This past year our traveling team of dancers stood together and realized that training with passion, hard work and commitment really does pay off.</span></p>
<p>We are a studio that accepts students regardless of background or financial situations.   We believe that every youth can benefit from the positive, nurturing and accepting environment we are committed to offering to all of our dancers. The need for such an environment truly stands out when I consider the family struggles (health and financial) that so many of our dancers live with and tell us that they see dance and our studio as their outlet and place where they are always accepted. In the past 12 years, I have seen lives changed and dreams realized for several of our students that without the support of their studio family and community, may have never happened.  I have seen students reacy beyond where they ever thought they could, because they knew people believed in them. </p>
<p>I am reaching out to you, with 5 dancers of ours, asking for your help. These 5 dancers have qualified for New York City Dance Alliance's (NYCDA) National competition and would have the opportunity to go to NYC this summer and take classes with some of the top dancers, instructors and choreographers in the country.  They would have the opportunity to audition for a wide variety of scholarships (from this organization that last summer awarded 2.8 million dollars in college scholarships!)! These dancers would also be able to attend workshops from falculty from Complexions Contemporary Ballet and the world famous Cirque du Soleil and finally they would get to compete for national recognition along side with so many inspiring and talented dancers from around the world.</p>
<p>Even though all five of these dancers are exceptional and have ambitions that include professional involvement in the dance world, Katlyn Lawhorne and Donovan Mellon were two out of three awarded Future Star Scholarships at one of the regional NYCDA events this season and Donovan was also awarded one of eight regional ballet scholarships at this event. Donvan would be attending these Nationals as a runner-up for the Teen Outstanding Dancer Award &amp; Scholarship from the regional event, and therefore would have a opportunity to compete for the national title.  </p>
<p>Without the financial contributions of others, these dancers will not be able to attend this event. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How you can help...</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise $8000 in donations &amp; sponsors. This would cover travel expenses to and from NYC, lodging, meals, convention fees and competition fees for this group of dancers to attend.  Lodging for 10 days in NYC can be extremely expensive, so $3500 of this $8000 goal, is to cover lodging. We expect travel expenses to be around $1200.  The remainder of funds raised will cover the NYCDA required fees for participation and meals.  </p>
<p>If we are able to raise more than this $8000, dependant upon how much, we may be able to have these dancers go to a Broadway show or professional performance, take in additional NYC siteseeing, or even take an additional national qualifying dancer(s) from our team with us on this trip. Otherwise, should there be additional funds raised not used for this direct trip, will be put aside for our scholarship program which would help dancers on our travel team next season</p>

<p>Hello. I’m Asae Dean, a stage director dedicated to producing passionate, poetic, provocative plays that explore both the personal and political aspects of love and sexuality.

Patrick, Tobias, and I have worked together on various theatrical projects over the past four years. <em>How I Learned to Drive </em>is the first show that we are independently producing.

</p><p>My name is Brian Egland.  I am a Producer, Director, Playwright, and Actor out of Lafayette, LA (but I'm a native of Breaux Bridge.)  In October of 2013 my play, She Still Dreams premiered at Cite des Arts, in Lafayette, LA.<br/></p><p>Out of 383 submissions total, She Still Dreams was selected by The DC Black Theatre Festival, and by the Atlanta Black Theatre Festival to perform.  In June and October of
2014 the cast and crew will travel to D.C. not only to perform our show, but to
represent dreamers, independent artists, urban theatre, and the theatrical arts of Lafayette, of Acadiana, and of Louisiana amongst a
diverse line up of plays from places like 
New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, and London, England to name a
few.  </p>
<p>This is a huge opportunity for an independent artist from a
small country town; doing plays in the local theatre, but it is also a huge
expense for an independent artist from a small country town that does plays at
the local theatre.  <br/></p>Our focus is the D.C. festival as it takes place sooner.<br/> 

<p>The estimated expense to take and perform She Still Dreams in D.C. is around $10,000.  </p>
<p>Our goal for this fundraiser is $2,000.  We’re hoping to raise 20% of our estimated
expense if not more through this indiegogo campaign.  </p>
<p>So to all of the dreamers, fellow artists, good Samaritans,
art lovers, fellow Louisianans, people of Acadiana, family, friends, and whoever
it may be that stumbles across this….PLEASE SUPPORT US.  PLEASE SUPPORT SHE STILL DREAMS GOING TO DC!</p><p></p><br/><h3>The Cost <br/>

</p><p><i>She
Still</i> <i>Dreams</i> is
the story of dreaming from a small town.<span> 
There’s the person that stayed, Savannah.  Now she’s a Louisiana woman with a very empty
life; a housewife, with no kids, and a husband,</span>Russell, that does not talk.<span>  She tries to make the best of a bad
situation, but truly she doesn’t believe that there is more for her than what
she already has.  So she spends her days
baking and waiting for visits from her best friend, Etta Mae.  Then there’s the person that left, Jethro,
who returns upon the death of his father. 
He seeks comfort and shelter with Savannah, his High </span>school sweetheart, but is confused as to why she
lives the life she lives.<span>  So what happens when you don’t choose love?<span>  When you’re not brave enough to follow your
dreams?  What happens if you are?  And when all the dreams come true, you’ve
been fulfilled, and you’ve been happy, what left is there?  Do you live in a constant world of
bliss?  Or do you still dream?</span></span></p><p><span><span>The

My name is Brian Egland.  I am a Producer, Director, Playwright, and Actor out of Lafayette, LA (but I'm a native of Breaux Bridge.)  In October of 2013 my play, She Still Dreams premiered at Cite des Arts, in Lafayette, LA.Out of 383 submissions total, She Still Dreams was selected by The DC Black Theatre Festival, and by the Atlanta Black Theatre Festival to perform.  In June and October of
2014 the cast and crew will travel to D.C. not only to perform our show, but to
represent dreamers, independent artists, urban theatre, and the theatrical arts of Lafayette, of Acadiana, and of Louisiana amongst a
diverse line up of plays from places like 
New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, and London, England to name a
few.  
This is a huge opportunity for an independent artist from a
small country town; doing plays in the local theatre, but it is also a huge
expense for an independent artist from a small country town that does plays at
the local theatre.  Our focus is the D.C. festival as it takes place sooner. 

The estimated expense to take and perform She Still Dreams in D.C. is around $10,000.  
Our goal for this fundraiser is $2,000.  We’re hoping to raise 20% of our estimated
expense if not more through this indiegogo campaign.  
So to all of the dreamers, fellow artists, good Samaritans,
art lovers, fellow Louisianans, people of Acadiana, family, friends, and whoever
it may be that stumbles across this….PLEASE SUPPORT US.  PLEASE SUPPORT SHE STILL DREAMS GOING TO DC!The Cost

The Story

She
Still Dreams is
the story of dreaming from a small town. 
There’s the person that stayed, Savannah.  Now she’s a Louisiana woman with a very empty
life; a housewife, with no kids, and a husband,Russell, that does not talk.  She tries to make the best of a bad
situation, but truly she doesn’t believe that there is more for her than what
she already has.  So she spends her days
baking and waiting for visits from her best friend, Etta Mae.  Then there’s the person that left, Jethro,
who returns upon the death of his father. 
He seeks comfort and shelter with Savannah, his High school sweetheart, but is confused as to why she
lives the life she lives.  So what happens when you don’t choose love?  When you’re not brave enough to follow your
dreams?  What happens if you are?  And when all the dreams come true, you’ve
been fulfilled, and you’ve been happy, what left is there?  Do you live in a constant world of
bliss?  Or do you still dream?The
show stars ULL theatre students Missi Shepherd and M.J. Battley, BET’s Sunday’s Best finalist, Nebu Neezy,
and Billboard Hip Hop Award honored recording
artist Jru Starz.  The Producer, Director, Playwright
Brian is a twenty six
year old native of Breaux Bridge, LA that holds a BFA in Performing Arts from
the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, graduated as The Outstanding
Graduate, and was honored by the Kennedy Center American College Theatre
Festival for Excellence in Original Playwriting.  As a Director and
Playwright Brian’s works include: The Birthday Dinner, A Window in the Kitchen,
Coping, and Ragin on Stage developed for ULL’s Orientation Program.  As an
actor Brian’s works include: Jitney, Nyetta Meaux’s Love Can’t Be Real,
Mississippi in the Face of Emmett Till, The Exonerated, The Laramie Project,
How I Learned to Drive, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, and In His Grace.

In 2011 the festival returned with 32 plays, ranging from five minute shorts to full lengths, each one based upon an Ancient Greek sky god or mythical figure who had become a constellation, moon, etc. In 2012 we debuted 25 one acts, each night pitting a play about an Olympian god against a play about a Titan, the race of gods who sired the Olympian gods, and were then overthrown by them. Last year we premiered 36 new plays about the Trojan War. </p><p>This year we are excited to premiere 28 new plays by 30 local writers- 13 of whom will be contributing written work to the festival for the first time! The plays range from shorts to one acts to full lengths, and each one explores a different monster. It will play 12 nights, November 5-22, at the EXIT Theatre in San Francisco, and if previous years are indicative of a trend, (every year we've broken our own records), we expect this to be the largest festival yet in terms of participants and audience!</p><p><strong> Why do you need so much money?</strong></p><p>Well, a bigger festival requires a bigger base of support, but we're actually tightening our budget and asking for the same amount as last year- even though the cost of creating a theater festival has, like everything else in the world, gone up. We're looking to raise $10,000- a really big number- because:</p><ul>
<li>$3,600 of the money we raise goes to keeping the doors of the theater open, the lights turned on and the water running- all really necessary! The rest of the money we raise is split two ways...</li>
<li>The first half goes to marketing and materials: postcards, posters, programs, high quality printings of the work created by our fine artists, the catering for our opening night party, and of course, all the photocopies of these brand new scripts we need for the readings.</li>
<li>The second half goes towards maintaining last year's lofty goal of paying everyone who works on the festival a stipend of some kind. In previous years actors and writers were paid, and we held raffles to raise some funds for the artists, but our entire production team and crew, including our box office manager and all of our directors, were volunteers. Last year we changed that by creating enough funds to offer everyone a small thank you for the hours, days and weeks they put into this project. If we meet our goal, we'll be able to do this again, and maybe even have enough left over to put some money away for next year- something we've never been able to do!</li>
</ul><p>Most importantly, if we manage to raise all of our funds, we'll be able to keep our ticket price (which is only $10) low and our comp policy generous, ensuring that the wide variety of audiences looking to experience these new works can do so affordably.</p><p><strong>Okay, but why should I support you? </strong></p><p>When you support this festival, you're not just supporting the 30 writers whose work will be presented this year, but also the 80+ actors we predict this festival will use, a dozen directors, and a dozen fine artists, the staff of the festival, and the theater where we work, the theater itself, the neighborhood it is located in, and the cultural life of the city that is our home. Events like the San Francisco Olympians Festival are part of what make the Bay Area a unique and inspiring place to be, a leader in the arts nationally, and a center for intellectual experiment and advancement.</p><p>The San Francisco Olympians Festival has been gaining momentum since its first year, with eight plays that were first given a public reading in the festival having gone on to full productions: 2010’s <em>Hermes </em>(No Nude Men Productions, Dramaworks, Bread and Water Theatre)<em>, Juno En Victoria </em>(Wily West Productions), and <em>Salty Towers </em>(Thunderbird Theater Company); 2011’s <em>Cassiopeia </em>(Eat Street Players)<em>, Chronus </em>(Bread and Water Theatre),<em> You’re Going To Bleed</em> (DivaFest), and Pleiades (No Nude Men Productions); 2013's <span>Take Me Home: a One-woman Odyssey (Lucy Tafler Presents)- soon to make its international debut at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival!</span> Many others have received additional readings on local and national stages, including: 2011’s <em>Joe Ryan</em> (Impact Theatre), <em>Pleiades </em>(Atlantic Stage), Io (Eat Street Players), and <em>Selene, or Someone Like The Moon</em> (EXIT Theatre); 2012’s <em>Caenis and Poseidon</em> (Playwrights’ Center of San Francisco), and Twins (San Francisco State); 2013's Under The Gods' Golden Cleets (Dramatist Guild). 2013's Walls Of Troy was a finalist for the Stanley Drama Award and the entire festival won ""<strong>Playwriting Series Most Likely to Win a Gold Medal</strong>"" from the SF Guardian. Additionally, EXIT Press has released a collection of five plays from year one of the festival, <em>Songs of Hestia</em>, and ten plays from year two, Heavenly Bodies, now available for purchase on Amazon.com and at bookstores across the country. So when you support our festival you're also supporting American Theater, Literature and Art, and adding to the cultural heritage of generations of artists and audience yet to come!</p><p></p><p>Thank you for giving whatever you can give, for passing this campaign on to others you know who may want to support us, and for helping this festival continue to grow!</p><p></p><h3>Find out more about the festival at <a href=""http://www.sfolympians.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sfolympians.com</a>.</h3><h3>This year's line up: </h3><p>

<p></p><p><strong><font><br/></font></strong></p></div>","Join over a hundred Bay Area writers, directors, actors, and fine artists to become a part of one of San Francisco's most exciting new theater festivals!  Who are you?The San Francisco Olympians Festival is an annual event that lasts for twelve nights (thirteen, if you count our opening party!) with a focus on the creation of new scripts for the theater in addition to providing a showcase for Bay Area fine artists, actors and writers.The Festival was started in 2010 by Stuart Bousel, and featured 12 new full length plays, each one based on one of the twelve Olympian gods of Ancient Greece. In 2011 the festival returned with 32 plays, ranging from five minute shorts to full lengths, each one based upon an Ancient Greek sky god or mythical figure who had become a constellation, moon, etc. In 2012 we debuted 25 one acts, each night pitting a play about an Olympian god against a play about a Titan, the race of gods who sired the Olympian gods, and were then overthrown by them. Last year we premiered 36 new plays about the Trojan War. This year we are excited to premiere 28 new plays by 30 local writers- 13 of whom will be contributing written work to the festival for the first time! The plays range from shorts to one acts to full lengths, and each one explores a different monster. It will play 12 nights, November 5-22, at the EXIT Theatre in San Francisco, and if previous years are indicative of a trend, (every year we've broken our own records), we expect this to be the largest festival yet in terms of participants and audience! Why do you need so much money?Well, a bigger festival requires a bigger base of support, but we're actually tightening our budget and asking for the same amount as last year- even though the cost of creating a theater festival has, like everything else in the world, gone up. We're looking to raise $10,000- a really big number- because:
$3,600 of the money we raise goes to keeping the doors of the theater open, the lights turned on and the water running- all really necessary! The rest of the money we raise is split two ways...
The first half goes to marketing and materials: postcards, posters, programs, high quality printings of the work created by our fine artists, the catering for our opening night party, and of course, all the photocopies of these brand new scripts we need for the readings.
The second half goes towards maintaining last year's lofty goal of paying everyone who works on the festival a stipend of some kind. In previous years actors and writers were paid, and we held raffles to raise some funds for the artists, but our entire production team and crew, including our box office manager and all of our directors, were volunteers. Last year we changed that by creating enough funds to offer everyone a small thank you for the hours, days and weeks they put into this project. If we meet our goal, we'll be able to do this again, and maybe even have enough left over to put some money away for next year- something we've never been able to do!
Most importantly, if we manage to raise all of our funds, we'll be able to keep our ticket price (which is only $10) low and our comp policy generous, ensuring that the wide variety of audiences looking to experience these new works can do so affordably.Okay, but why should I support you? When you support this festival, you're not just supporting the 30 writers whose work will be presented this year, but also the 80+ actors we predict this festival will use, a dozen directors, and a dozen fine artists, the staff of the festival, and the theater where we work, the theater itself, the neighborhood it is located in, and the cultural life of the city that is our home. Events like the San Francisco Olympians Festival are part of what make the Bay Area a unique and inspiring place to be, a leader in the arts nationally, and a center for intellectual experiment and advancement.The San Francisco Olympians Festival has been gaining momentum since its first year, with eight plays that were first given a public reading in the festival having gone on to full productions: 2010’s Hermes (No Nude Men Productions, Dramaworks, Bread and Water Theatre), Juno En Victoria (Wily West Productions), and Salty Towers (Thunderbird Theater Company); 2011’s Cassiopeia (Eat Street Players), Chronus (Bread and Water Theatre), You’re Going To Bleed (DivaFest), and Pleiades (No Nude Men Productions); 2013's Take Me Home: a One-woman Odyssey (Lucy Tafler Presents)- soon to make its international debut at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival! Many others have received additional readings on local and national stages, including: 2011’s Joe Ryan (Impact Theatre), Pleiades (Atlantic Stage), Io (Eat Street Players), and Selene, or Someone Like The Moon (EXIT Theatre); 2012’s Caenis and Poseidon (Playwrights’ Center of San Francisco), and Twins (San Francisco State); 2013's Under The Gods' Golden Cleets (Dramatist Guild). 2013's Walls Of Troy was a finalist for the Stanley Drama Award and the entire festival won ""Playwriting Series Most Likely to Win a Gold Medal"" from the SF Guardian. Additionally, EXIT Press has released a collection of five plays from year one of the festival, Songs of Hestia, and ten plays from year two, Heavenly Bodies, now available for purchase on Amazon.com and at bookstores across the country. So when you support our festival you're also supporting American Theater, Literature and Art, and adding to the cultural heritage of generations of artists and audience yet to come!Thank you for giving whatever you can give, for passing this campaign on to others you know who may want to support us, and for helping this festival continue to grow!Find out more about the festival at www.sfolympians.com.This year's line up:

<p>We are pleased to announce The Denizens Theater Company’s first production, ""Savage in Limbo"",  a concert play by John Patrick Shanley. We will be partnering with the design team of For The People NYC, a team of artists putting talent to work and bringing the Brooklyn artistic community together with custom, creative events.

<p>Our production will run January 5th, 6th, and 7th, 2018. The setting is a slightly seedy neighborhood bar in the Bronx, where a group of regulars (who all happen to be the same age—thirty-two) seeks relief from the disappointments and tedium of the outside world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a company founded in a pandemic with the intention of keeping live theater and classic texts available and accessible to all. For our first production, we are returning to the roots of remote theater with an episodic radio drama based on L.M. Montgomery's novel Anne of Green Gables.  With an original adaptation designed for radio, and a small but mighty cast, we aim to bring to life this timeless story of a fiery, idealistic girl and the community that she finds in Avonlea. You can listen to the trailer now on <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/5KQhjM08apozH4KRLexkQI?si=iLW0JzEFR4GEorwcY0JNnw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spotify</a>. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our main goal in fundraising is to cover labor costs. We believe that artists, like any other profession, should be paid for their work. In addition, we want to ensure good quality sound for the project, so we need funding to get our actors any necessary recording equipment, as well as cover labor for audio editing. We are still a small company, and our budget is reflected proportionally, but we are looking to grow in the future and any excess funds will be used to produce more theater that is accessible for all.</p>
<p>In exchange for your donation, we have a range of ways to show our gratitude:</p>
<ul>
<li>For $5, receive a personalized shout out in our virtual playbill</li>
<li>For $10, we will add a video message from one of our cast members</li>
<li>For $25, you will also be sent a small themed gift to enjoy along with the performance</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We recognize that we will be tackling a monumental amount of audio editing, and compiling tracks recorded in completely different environments as our actors are all recording remotely in their own homes. However, our team is committed to taking the time and care needed to ensure a quality final product, drawing on expert help as needed.</p>

<li>
<strong>Artist Fees</strong> – Elephant Run District is committed to paying artists for their work. We always provide stipends for all actors, directors, designers and stage managers involved in our projects. It is one of our largest production costs.</li>

<li>
<strong>Rehearsal Space</strong> – Both <em>Brecht in the Park</em> and <em>American Gun Show</em> need to rehearse somewhere! While we are frugal and smart about this, we occasionally have to plop down cash.</li>

<li>

Elephant Run District’s Transatlantic Summer Season

Elephant Run District is thrilled to present our Transatlantic Summer Season!
Now in our fourth year, we create theater that entertains our audience, while addressing important social issues. This summer is no different. So far, the New York Times has called our work “unexpectedly poignant”, NYTheatre.com terms us “polished, professional and entertaining… the kind of theatre I love best” and Cultural Capitol declares us “flawless.”
Elephant Run District is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Your contribution is tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law.  
This summer, we are producing: 
Brecht in the Park:

This summer, we will produce three rarely performed one acts by Bertolt Brecht: The Elephant Calf (1926), In Search of Justice (1938) and The Exception and the Rule (1929). The plays, two of which have never been produced in New York City before, will be performed for free near Central Park’s Great Hill. Using puppetry and masks, we will connect these three plays with modern day issues of Occupy Movement, Citizens United, Stop & Frisk and Stand Your Ground gun laws. It’s a public service to New York City, and we want you there.
 

American Gun Show: 


 

After a wildly-successful run at the FRIGID New York Festival (under the title Two Lovely Black Eyes), we are honored to bring American Gun Show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. This solo (sorta) comedy about gun violence offers a nuanced and human view of American gun culture. We hope to be ambassadors for a different view of American gun culture than the world often sees – one that is more complicated than gun-huggers versus peace-mongers. We hope you’ll join our vision!
 
What We Need:
We’re extremely excited to announce a “moral support” grant from the Yip Harburg Foundation! Their funds, as well as some private donations, have given us a boost, but we still have a ways to go.
Your contributions will go towards:


Artist Fees – Elephant Run District is committed to paying artists for their work. We always provide stipends for all actors, directors, designers and stage managers involved in our projects. It is one of our largest production costs.

Masks and Puppets – Brecht in the Park will include masks and puppets designed by NYIT Award-winning (and soon-to-be War Horse tour performer) Joe Osheroff.

Rehearsal Space – Both Brecht in the Park and American Gun Show need to rehearse somewhere! While we are frugal and smart about this, we occasionally have to plop down cash.

Transportation – We gotta fly Chris and Heather over to Edinburgh to make American Gun Show happen! Airlines charge an arm and a leg, so could you give us a hand?

Performance space in Edinburgh – Our new friends at the Gryphon Venues gave us a great performing space in the center of town. It’s a hot venue that produces winning shows, filled with young talent and the spirit of the Edinburgh Fringe. But that does come at a cost. 

The flat  – It will cost twice what it costs to live in New York for a month to be in Edinburgh for 25 days. 
 
The Impact:

Our season is a call to action, both in our city, our country and our world. Brecht in the Park is a public service to all New York City residents, and will rekindle discussion about Stop and Frisk, Occupy, Citizens United and Stand Your Ground laws.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Zachari Productions is thrilled to be invited back to the New York International Fringe Festival with a brand new script by Peter Zachari called the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">THE 3RD GENDER</span>. </p>
<p><em>THE 3RD GENDER</em> is a futuristic, sci-fi allegory set in the year 2397 that finds Manten, a twenty year old “straight” amnesiac struggling to find his existence in a world now ruled by an elevated group of spiritual beings that live in the intermediate state between man and woman. This group is known as “The 3rd Gender” and the world no longer allows heteronormatives like Manten to be born. His escape from being “eliminated” forces him on a journey to rediscover his existence in an unfamiliar world that both rejects and haunts him. </p>
<h3><strong>And now we have been selected to premiere our show at The New York International Fringe Festival.  (<a href=""http://www.fringenyc.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><span style=""color: #4d4d4d;"">www.fringenyc.org</span></a>) We are thrilled to have this fantastic opportunity to bring these characters to New York City, and now we need your help. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>We Need Your Help!</strong></p>
<p>We need to mount a production of this complete with costume, sound, props, publicity, the works. Your donation to this project will help make this dream of ours a reality. By contributing money to this project, you are helping the artists associated with this project to see an original production come to fruition. We have set our goal at $4000 but if we reach that, please keep giving! Every cent raised on this site will absolutely go to the funding of this production. </p>

<h3>What is ""Antony &amp; Cleopatra: Infinite Lives""?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<em>Antony &amp; Cleopatra: Infinite Lives</em> is a new play by J. Michael DeAngelis &amp; Pete Barry, incorporating original text by William Shakespeare.  It's the story of  an Egyptian expatriate who gets caught between two revolutionaries - her fiancée, an activist director who tries to upend his commissioned Shakespeare production, and her brother, a nationalist fresh from the violence of Tahrir Square.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Drawn from still developing current events, this original play juxtaposes today's Egypt alongside Cleopatra's Egypt as seen by Shakespeare.  It puts a spotlight on theater as historical record and questions the role of the artist in politics.</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>WAIT A MINUTE - I'M HAVING DEJA VU!</h3>
<p>That's right.  Last year, thanks to the help of our many supporters, we produced <em>Infinite Lives</em> at the Penn Museum as part of the 2012 Philly Fringe.  Now, we have been selected from hundreds of appliciants to do it all again...at the New York International Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>We have an amazing cast and an icredible performing space at the <a href=""http://www.fringenyc.org/index.php/shows/venue-guide/174-venue-14bleecker"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lynn Redgrave Theater.</a></p>

<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The play is being produced as part of the 2013 FringeNYC by <a href=""http://www.porchroom.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Porch Room</a>, an award-winning independent theater company.  Authors J. Michael DeAngelis and Pete Barry are multi-award winning playwrights, whose works have been published by Samuel French and Vintage Press.  This is their third original production for the Philly Fringe, having previously presented sold-out runs of <strong><em>X/Y</em></strong>and <em><strong>Signs from</strong></em><strong> God</strong>, which recently concluded an encore production in New York City.  Director John Dowgin is a co-founder of The Porch Room and as helmed such productions as <strong><em>Othello</em></strong> and <em><strong>A Few Good Men</strong>.</em>
</div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div>
<em><br/></em>As in the original production, costume design is by <strong>Olivia Rutigliano</strong> and the show features several pieces of original music by <strong>Rebecca Kotcher, </strong>including a haunting and beautiful adapatation of Shakespeare's Sonnet #27.</div>

<h3>Why We're Asking For Your Help</h3>
<div>
<p>Producing a show on this scale presents new challenges The Porch Room.</p>

<p>Ever wanted to have a play written just for you? WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN! Support us at the highest level and the boys from The Porch Room will crank out an original one-act play!</p>

Paper Balloon are Alex Kanefsky (writer/performer) Darren Clark (music/lyrics) Dorie Kinnear (deviser/performer).
We make original theatre for young audiences and their families. 
Since 2012 we have toured to theatres across the South East, the UK and Moscow. We make work with artists from around the world including the US, Russia and Australia. 
We believe passionately in telling new and exciting stories to children in the most interesting and accessible ways. Our work is a mashup of live music, puppetry, storytelling and physical theatre. 
Our Campaign
On the furthest edge of a wind-battered rock there sits a small fishing town. Sometimes it feels like the town is on the edge of the world. 
That’s mainly because it is.Dylan lives with his grandma, forbidden from venturing beyond the shore. But the terrifying tales told of horrors in the deep only whet his appetite - he stares at the ocean and dreams. 
Can one unlikely friendship save the Town On The Sea from catastrophe?
Our new production The Boy and the Mermaid is our third touring piece for families. Inspired by the humanitarian refugee crisis on Europe’s shores, this new play uses the sea shanty tradition to explore how communities and relationships are affected by 'Otherness', through a childhood friendship against the odds. 
Our production received funding from Arts Council England for Research and Development in February 2016. We are now awaiting further funding to support a tour to South East England. 
This campaign is to allow us to spend one further week exploring the piece's theatrical world; and to run a drama workshop with young refugees & asylum seekers, engaging with the themes at its heart.
Before we get into the nuts and bolts of rehearsal, we want to spend a week clarifying our theatrical languages, perfecting our puppetry and exploring the story with young people. 
By contributing to this campaign, you will help  

reach vulnerable young people with a specially devised drama workshop in a safe and supportive environment 
allow us to make new theatrical discoveries that enrich the final production before it reaches families across the South East
support a new production for young people engaging with difficult issues in a fun, accessible and innovative way

What We Need & What You Get
Paper Balloon are asking for £2500 to support 1 week of Research and Development (R&D) in January 2017; and workshops with young refugees and asylum seekers in the South East. 
The R&D 

4 artists (paid at industry standard rates) will explore music, movement and puppetry within the piece 
The Unicorn Theatre (the UK's flagship theatre for children) has kindly offered to donate one week's rehearsal space for our use on the project 
This creative work will then influence the script, songs and design that will feature in rehearsals for our tour later that year

The workshops

We will work with young refugees and asylum seekers in Oxford 
In a safe and supportive environment, we will explore issues such as friendship through difference and overcoming linguistic and cultural barriers 
What we discover in these workshops will affect and influence our production; something that has always proved key to our shows

The Impact

It takes a lot of work to create a project like this. Arts Council England have been a massive help, as have the many theatres who have supported our work. Paper Balloon artists often work for free in order to get the project off the ground, but we can only offer so much time.  
Any funding towards our goal will help pay for our time to come, enriching the project and allowing us to devote all our energies towards it. 
We have found that the extra time of one week of R&D makes all the difference to the quality of our work; by paying artists properly, allowing us to travel to workshops and covering the costs of materials, we are able to greatly improve the finished product. 
Why this and why now?

<p><em><em><em><em><strong>Cuando se nace para bailar, sólo se piensa en dar nuevos sentidos a cada movimiento y experiencia. </strong></em></em></em></em></p>

transformen el movimiento en un discurso corpóreo capaz de expresar
infinidades. Nace de la iniciativa de Isadora López Pagán, bailarina de danza
contemporánea formada en el Institut del Teatre en Barcelona quien con ayuda de
artistas de otras corrientes decide tomar rienda en un proyecto que tendrá como

<p><strong>¿Qué proponemos? Un diálogo creativo. </strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>El grupo Cos Parlant se enfoca
principalmente en la danza y las miles de formas de exponerla, compartirla y
comprenderla. De ahí surge la idea de un Junte de Jóvenes Creadorxs que busca
reunir a artistas que dan comienzo a su carrera como coreógrafxs y darles la
oportunidad de presentar sus creaciones en un espacio escénico común. El
programa constará de tres o cuatro creadorxs, entre ellxs Cos Parlant, quienes
en una duración entre media hora y una hora presentarán piezas de corta
duración.</p>
<p><span>El
tema será libre para lxs creadorxs y trabajarán por su cuenta hasta la semana
de la programación donde antes de hacer la puesta en escena tendrán un espacio
de intercambio de propuestas. La idea está en ir más allá del resultado
coreográfico y la diversidad escénica que se pueda unir en un mismo espacio. El
propósito principal de este JUNTE es llegar al diálogo y al intercambio de
procesos creativos que cada creador/a ha utilizado para concluir el trabajo que
presentará.</span></p>

<p>Hoy en día la danza contemporánea se
nutre de su propio proceso. Los creadores y creadoras que deciden crear a
través de este estilo de danza se sumergen en investigaciones tanto académicas
como físicas. El movimiento ya no es visto como un paso normativo sino como un
mundo de sensaciones, sentimientos y conocimientos que provocan que el cuerpo
se mueva y armonice en lo que llamamos baile. Con los años lxs nuevxs creadorxs
que van ganando nombre han establecido que la prioridad no está en el resultado
sino en el proceso para llegar a una finalidad. <em>Lxs bailrinxs de danza
contemporánea no solo tienen como labor seguir las órdenes del coreógrafo sino
que a nivel personal tienen que ser personas plenas, capaces de abrir su cuerpo
y alma a temas que no necesariamente están relacionados a la danza.</em></p>
<p><span> El
cuerpo es capaz de absorber y transformar el entorno que le rodea pero para eso
se necesita comenzar a crear un discurso propio donde el cuerpo trabajado y
amoldado pueda llenar el espacio con sus interrogantes y opiniones. Cos Parlant
cada día trabaja en la búsqueda de este discurso no verbal y es por eso que
propone un espacio para llevar a cabo este intercambio entre creadorxs jóvenes
como ellxs.</span></p>
<p><span>Con
dos días de intercambio y dos funciones abiertas al público, lxs creadorxs

el intercambio de conocimientos. Comenzando con clases multidireccionales donde
pondrán en práctica sus técnicas de entrenamiento para comenzar a aprender de
lxs otrxs bailarinxs. Seguido a esto cada creadorx hará una exposicion de su
pieza para lxs demás creadorxs. Presentará la pieza finalizada pero también
hablará del proceso en el que se ha sumergido a lo largo de la creación. La
idea de este espacio es generar un conversatorio entre creadorxs y aprender de
los otros procesos para enriquecer el propio.</span></p>
<p><span>Los

creadores serán el menú para lxs espectadorxs. Como conclusión a los días

<p><span> Para

ningún tipo de restricción en cuanto a los medios. La única cosa que se les
solicitará a lxs participantes es que documenten todo el proceso, desde la
elección del tema, gestión del tiempo de ensayos y los recursos físico de
investigación. La forma en que sea recogido el proceso puede variar. Como por

el JUNTE como un camino para ampliar el vínculo de comunicación entre lxs

Project is an inter-tribal and multicultural performing arts company, fiscally

utilizing theater, music, dance, spoken word, and film to dissect the American

the primary means for which to conduct its exploration. This mission is carried out through the
development and staging of the works of Native American playwrights,
educational outreach on Native American culture, and the production of the
works of other American voices that are not frequently heard. It is the goal of Eagle Project to produce

<h3>Our

&amp; The Performance</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Everything, from the set to the music to the lighting, will
be utilized to immerse the audience in these Louisiana communities. Many of the design elements will be used to emphasize
simplicity in order to highlight some of the universal themes that both these
stories share. Music will include an
eclectic mix of Native American/ indigenous sounds along with jazz and elements
of Creole culture. This is in order to
explore the fusion of these heritages, how they relate, how they differ, and
their common root in the American experience.</span></p>
<p><br/>

The cast and creative team will consist of some
of the most talented, diverse, and unique theater artists in New York
City. This whole production is designed
to give those who hardly ever have a voice in American Theater a platform. This goes for the people involved in
executing the production, in addition to the characters in the stories
themselves.</p>

<h3>Why
this project?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst atrocities
in American history. While this storm
was certainly a force of nature, the impact was greatly compounded by the
racial and class divisions that still permeate contemporary American
society. Many of these divisions run deep
because of policies that were put into effect centuries ago, but have yet to be
changed. </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><i>Lost Voices</i></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> brings to the

<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>The
Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><i>Lost Voices</i></b> directly dramatizes the consequences of not
adhering to what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. phrased as, “The fierce urgency of
now.”  <b><i>Vanishing Point </i></b> parallels the
loss of the tribe’s culture with the physical disappearance of their land due
to climate change and greed. This,
combined with the current bureaucracy of the federal recognition system, puts
many state recognized tribes, such as the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, at a great
disadvantage. By helping to bring their
story to light, we will not only hope to bring awareness to their plight, but
plant a seed in our viewers’ minds that it’s still not too late to alter the
tide of history.</span>
</p>
<p><b><i>Wide Blossoms</i></b> broadens the scope of the evening to remind us
that no matter who we are, where we come from, and how much money we have,
nothing can insulate us from what we collectively do to one another.  One of the central characters in the piece
tries everything, both cultural and physical, to separate himself from the truth,
but it follows him wherever he goes.  Yet
the catharsis that only comes from acceptance, allows him to finally be free.</p>
<p>Whether one lives in Louisiana, Florida, California,
Manhattan Island, or any of the areas in between, <b><i>Lost Voices</i></b> drives home
the reality that how we treat one another and our planet are interconnected,
and that we only have a certain amount of time to change course.</p>

</div></div>","About Eagle Project 

Eagle
Project is an inter-tribal and multicultural performing arts company, fiscally
sponsored by New York Live Arts, that behaves as an artistic laboratory by
utilizing theater, music, dance, spoken word, and film to dissect the American
identity, while using the Native American experience, both past and present, as
the primary means for which to conduct its exploration. This mission is carried out through the
development and staging of the works of Native American playwrights,
educational outreach on Native American culture, and the production of the
works of other American voices that are not frequently heard. It is the goal of Eagle Project to produce
theatrical work that gives us as Americans a true recollection of our past, a
better understanding of our present, for a just and more inclusive vision for
our future.  Supporting our 21st
Century writers is critical to the work that we do. Hatch is Eagle Project’s program of readings,
staged readings, and workshops to support the playwright in their work, and
thus the time table and format of the presentation is based on where the writer
is in their process. Sometimes the work
goes all the way to full production, as did our first production, Wood
Bones by William S. Yellow Robe, Jr., our second production, Broken
Heart Land by Vicki Lynn Mooney, and our third production (in
partnership with Rebel Theater Company), Trail of Tears by Thomas J. Soto. Over the past four years, Eagle Project has
had the privilege of collaborating and/or being hosted by the Public Theater,
The Lark Play Development Center, Primary Stages, Nuyorican Poets Café, as well
as the United Nations. In addition, our
programming consists of our America Unveiled Series, an annual event that
brings talented poets and comedians together to riff on one of the hottest
topics of the time. We are also pleased
to announce the launch of our new Education Department, scheduled to start in
early 2017.
   
LOST VOICES - Synopsis The two one-act plays that will make up Lost Voices will explore
two different ethnic groups who were greatly affected by Hurricane Katrina, and
who, because of their economic status in our society, have been almost lost in
our consciousness.  Vanishing Point is a new

tribe, America’s first official climate refugees, Vanishing Point follows
two characters who fight to stay above water in Louisiana. If they can just weather the storm, they will
survive. But what if the storm never
ends and the water never retreats? Will
saving themselves mean the loss of their entire tribe? Vanishing Point is the first play

But how accidental was it, really? Set in a night club and told from the perspective of Rosaline, Romeo's first love; Valentine, Mercutio's brother; and Queen Mab, who might personify more than just a dream. Dance your way through the other side of history's most famous love story.On the stroke of Midnight on September 12, 2014 we will open Mad Blood & Other Beauties at The Playground @ The Adrienne as part of the Philadelphia Live Arts/Fringe Festival. It is a play inspired by the unspoken characters of Romeo and Juliet. We will be recreating the famous Capulet Masquerade where Romeo and Juliet meet. We will be modernizing the story thereby making it more accessible to a 2014 audience. Jason Rosenberg wrote a play where poetry, Shakespeare's text, and contemporary language meet and juxtapose one another. Through his beautiful text we will be creating a theatrical piece that uses contemporary music and designs inspired by steam punk/ Modern Elizabethan Bondage / and club fashion. We want our audience to feel immersed by our recreation of the Capulet Masquerade. Maybe you will meet your star-crossed lover at our show... We are inspired to make theater that speaks to our generation. Instead of watching Netflix in bed on a Friday night, we want to make work that draws people to a theatrical event. We hope you come see Mad Blood & Other Beauties and donate! The ImpactAll of us are current or recent graduates of The University of the Arts, which was just a step away from the epicenter of the Philadelphia theatre scene. As we make our path way through the Philly community as young theatre artists; we hope to make Mad Blood & Other Beauties an example of the kind of riveting theatrical work that we hope to contribute for the Philadelphia theatre community. In return, we hope this show will be a launching pad for future work with the company members and new collaborators! Please help support Philly Emerging Artists make great art! Thank you.What We NeedTo have a production recreating the Capulet MasqueradeWe are asking for $3250! Your contribution will include:$1200: Our space rental for The Playground @ The Adrienne Theatre and our rehearsal/ audition rental. $1200: Production expenses including costumes, scenic design, lighting, sound composition, and props. We will be using design elements such as masks, modern Elizabethan Bondage fashion, weapons for fight scenes , and lighting figurations/set made of found materials. ( You'll have to see our show to see the brilliance of what our designers will create!) $500: Fringe Fees for the festival and insurance for our show. $350: Marketing and Poster Printing. Our goal is to draw current theater goers as well as draw new audiences to the theater. We want 350 so we can print posters/postcards all over the city and have a strong presence on Social Media. * This campaign of $3250 will not compensate the Creators of this project*Jason Rosenberg is a Philadelphia based playwright and actor, entering his senior year at UArts , where he is currently dramaturging Matt Pfeiffer's production of We Are Proud to Present A Presentation this upcoming fall.

<p></p></div>","DISTRICTLAND is about a city full of transplant activists who cannot
name DC’s mayor.  It’s about slam poetry, your iPhone, your internship,
your Mall kickball team, Law School, Rhodes Scholars, World Bankers, Peace
Corps, first generation baggage, the lone DC native and how a cabbie from
Kabul’s life is so much more interesting than yours.
A satire, DISTRICTLAND is a loving tribute to youth and ambition and a plea for all of
us to slow down, open a bottle of wine and just talk to the people we
live with. Spoiler Alert: you are not your LinkedIn profile!


 DISTRICTLAND
needs your help!
We are
asking you, our friends and fans, to help us create this unique theatrical experience
at Capital Fringe this summer in DC!
Please help
us reach our goal of $6000 by the end
of our run. Your donation with defray the costs of:
•               
     Paying our artists for their time and
effort
•               
     Fringe festival fees
•               
     Set acquisition –  e.g. a faux DC taxi cab ....
•               
     Costumes and props – this is a
detail-oriented show!
•               
     Lights and Sound – both are crucial to
Dellaporta’s vision
•               
     Insurance – Just in case
•               
     Marketing materials and publicity –
canvassing the town
Every little
bit helps! Please share this campaign with your friends. And even if you cannot

<p><b>The Great Forgotten is set during
WWI  and the Roaring Twenties. Two sisters, Elizabeth and Celia, work as
American nurses in France during the Great War. When they return the roaring
twenties is in full swing. While both sisters eventually become flappers,
performing together at a local speakeasy in Manhattan, one struggles to forget
the war and everyone she lost, while the other finds solace in her new life
and  seeks fame and fortune as a dancer. </b></p>
<p><b>We are beyond excited to have been
accepted into the NYC Fringe Festival! The Great Forgotten was one of 200
plays chosen out of over 1,000 submissions! The New York Fringe Festival gets
over 80,000 spectators each year many of whom are industry professionals! As
women playwrights and actors, we strove to write a piece with strong female
characters. We also wanted to tell the story of the nurses, the unsung
heroes, who served during The Great War. This play is not only a
historical account of what nurses endured during WWI, but a tribute to all
women whose contributions have been chronically overlooked. The Great
Forgotten sheds light on women who have had the courage to pursue their
passions despite the struggles of sexism and oppression.</b></p>

<p><b>We realize that putting up a play is
challenging and that creating the authenticity we hope for on stage will be

It's aimed at any genre of live performance where the participants are developing new ways of working. The show on 8th February at The Bread and Roses, Clapham includes improvisation, cross art form based on tango and performance poetry. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The aim is two fold first to pay expenses of participants - it's about developing as artists without adding to or creating personal debt. We also need to pay for a technician, some marketing and create the beginning of a small production fund for a full scale show by one of the participants. </p>

<p>The perks are first a thank you by email then a thank you from The Stage on the night for the audience to cheer. Then a personally improvised poem in an email, then a personally dedicated mp3 recording of the poem. Finally a two man impro show in your own home (London and Brighton and Hove only).</p>
<p>If we don't make the full amount the first call on funds is technician's fee and performers' expenses</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I have been producing and directing theatre for many years and always seek to do something new. This includes Shakespeare played in private houses and an interactive, site specific and immersive show in a cafe. The Shakespeare sold out - the cafe show got a five star review.</p>
<p>My work has often used new actors and some have also gone onto direct and create their own work. Small scale innovation like this can eventually build to shows which delight the audience and employ creative people enriching the lives of both audience and performer. In these austere times it is essential to us all but funds are tight.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Performance Lab is a scratch night with a difference. It's aimed at any genre of live performance where the participants are developing new ways of working. The show on 8th February at The Bread and Roses, Clapham includes improvisation, cross art form based on tango and performance poetry.    What We Need & What You Get The aim is two fold first to pay expenses of participants - it's about developing as artists without adding to or creating personal debt. We also need to pay for a technician, some marketing and create the beginning of a small production fund for a full scale show by one of the participants. 
5 performers from Brighton @ £20 each = £100                                                                   10 performers from London @ £10 each = £100                                                                   Technician's fee                                             = £ 30                                                                    Marketing flyers/posters                            = £ 30                                                                    Future Production fund                                = £240
Total £500
                                                                                    
The perks are first a thank you by email then a thank you from The Stage on the night for the audience to cheer. Then a personally improvised poem in an email, then a personally dedicated mp3 recording of the poem. Finally a two man impro show in your own home (London and Brighton and Hove only).
If we don't make the full amount the first call on funds is technician's fee and performers' expenses
    The Impact I have been producing and directing theatre for many years and always seek to do something new. This includes Shakespeare played in private houses and an interactive, site specific and immersive show in a cafe. The Shakespeare sold out - the cafe show got a five star review.
My work has often used new actors and some have also gone onto direct and create their own work. Small scale innovation like this can eventually build to shows which delight the audience and employ creative people enriching the lives of both audience and performer. In these austere times it is essential to us all but funds are tight.

WHAT IS CROWDED TUB COLLECTIVE?
We are a newly formed collective that is focused on inciting a reconstruction of our human selves by delving into the lifeblood of great stories, one project at a time.  By maintaining a single focus, we can put all of our energy towards challenging our boundaries, concepts, and perceptions of the world in which we live, with Shakespeare's rich text as our primary tool. As storytellers, we believe that a solid investment in these explorations is fundamental. Granted, this territory has been traversed in the past, but now it’s being charted by rookies in a new and exciting way.
 
Meet the Tubbers
Matt Schwader: Director / Artistic Director
ShaRhonda Knott Dawson: Producer
Brent T. Barnes: Stage Manager
Alecia Annacchino: Juliet
Chad Bay: Tybalt
Jacqueline Davies: Capulet
Taylor Glowac: Romeo
Luce Metrius: Mercutio
BrittneyLove Smith: Nurse
Carlos Trevino: Friar
 
Our first production: Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet
 
 
 On Tap in the Tub
WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT OUR APPROACH?
The story of Romeo & Juliet reveals a bright glimpse of something worth longing for: a purity in love - a passion that ignites just as rapidly as it is extinguished.  This glimpse challenges our ideas of worth and of the value of a happy ending.  To see evidence of our greatest desires made manifest is a wish for anyone with a beating heart, but it raises hard questions: is a happy ending possible in a world that is often so cruel?  Are stars really crossed, or is Fate in our own hands?  
 
Everyone knows the story of Romeo & Juliet; but when we see a great production of it we want so badly for these two characters to live and love that we can't help but cheer for them to survive, even when we know the tragic ending from the start. We want to give our audience their most passionate experience of an epic journey that constantly ricochets between absolute joy and utter desperation.
 
The process that we are developing to embody the story will challenge us to confront and reconstruct how we experience language. For eight weeks we will study the text in a rigorous investigation to uncover the power of the poetry, in what we are calling Shakespeare ""Labs"". These Labs consist of breaking down the structures of the language in order to master the rhetoric inherent in the play. What will we discover when we stop and really dissect a word? Can we find new meanings/inspirations in words we hear on a daily basis? How do the sounds and rhythms of our language influence meaning? What is the most effective way to reach one’s core using language?  
 
The Lab process will flow into a more traditional rehearsal format in March.  We'll use what we uncovered in our Labs to create the final piece, which will culminate in three weekends of high-paced, heartfelt and sharp-witted performances.  
 
This is not just another staging of Romeo & Juliet.  We're pushing ourselves beyond our comfort zones to rediscover our connections to speech and humanity, in an environment where we welcome even failure: after all, the biggest ""mistakes"" can lead to fantastic breakthroughs! Our greatest wish is to not only discover our connections to Romeo & Juliet, but to inspire a transformation of our audience's relationship to the play, and give them a story to remember!
 
 
 
Don’t Miss Our Performances!
Romeo & Juliet will be performed the last three weeks of April!
April 11th - 27th:  Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 8:00pm
The Bughouse Theatre
2054 W. Irving Park Rd., Chicago, IL
(Just 3 Blocks West from the CTA Brown Line)
 
Why Donate to our Tub?

We're excited to continue our discovery process with Romeo & Juliet.  While we all come from different backgrounds in theatre, we are united in our passion to explore meaning and reason in new and challenging ways. We're bursting with curiosity and eager to share our findings with you.

Not only will our production team benefit from this experiment, so will you! With your donations and attendance, you’ll have the chance to get gifts and rewards from the production team, help us spread the word about  Crowded Tub, and come with us on our journey through Shakespeare’s text.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>Our story is the story of many artists and people who come to a point in life where they need to move on and pursue another career. Dancers like athletes have a short lived career and at some point need to be prepared to make a living doing something else. At a time when most are looking for promotions or a climb up the ladder. Dancers are starting over, some continuing education, training, and figuring out who they are and where they want to be.  </div>

<div style=""""><p style="""">We have enlisted an amazing group of former Broadway, film and tv dancers, choreographers, educators, agents and students who are willingly giving of their time and energy to share their stories of triumph during and after their career in dance as well as reflecting on the future generation of dancers and what preparations they need to be mindful of .</p></div>

<p>Dance is at the height of popular culture. We see it in our lives everyday in movies, videos, and television shows. Dancers spend their lives training and perfecting their craft to be able to compete in a highly saturated field and hope they are able to secure employment to sustain their lives.  What most don't consider is what happens after dancers move on, either from injury, lack of desire or age, that propels them to explore the world outside of dance.  This documentary touches on a very taboo subject in the dance community.

<p>The Senior Performance students at TheatreVCU, in conjunction with our department’s faculty, staff, generous patrons, and other donors are harnessing our creativity, talent, and devotion to the performing arts in order to raise the funds necessary to pursue our professional destinies. The money raised will go directly toward <strong>enhancing the legitimate, professional opportunities that will be available to us as actors, singers, directors, producers, and aspiring playwrights leading up to and following graduation. </strong></p>
<p> The money raised will help fund two trips: <strong>New York and Los Angeles</strong>. These business trips will give our students the opportunity to audition for, be introduced to, and work closely with influential industry professionals. Additionally, the students will perform a <strong>Showcase in New York City</strong> where they will have their best scenes and songs reviewed by casting directors, agents, etc. These funds will also allow TheatreVCU Seniors to participate in numerous workshops on both coasts as well as attend <strong>Actor’s Connection: the ultimate job fair for actors breaking into the professional world. </strong></p>
<p> Most importantly, long before travel plans become a priority, the money we raise will help bring experts and industry professionals to TheatreVCU. The preparation, advice, and encouragement we receive from our guest artists will become an invaluable part of our training. By learning the nature of the business first-hand, from experienced professionals, our students are becoming better equipped and better prepared for the world of professional performance art. T<strong>he purpose of this project, as an extension of the senior class, is to help raise awareness of our pursuit as well as give the outside world an up-close and personal insight into TheatreVCU’s Senior class. </strong></p>
<p>We definitely have some heavy financial demands up against us and we are doing all we can to help support ourselves and our peers. Our goal as a class is $50,000 TOTAL to fund everyone and we're doing several fundraisers to reach our goal including: <br/>----a weekly senior challenge at our Friday Night Live Variety Show, <br/>----bake sales as far as the eye can see<br/>----Our Holiday Showcase, The Jingle Ball, put on entirely by the Senior Class, not to mention sending countless letters of support to gain sponsors.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A few months ago, we (Denise and Rod Bigner) were thinking about how much we would love to operate a place were people could come together and experience the magic of movies as a community.  We didn’t have much money but we sold our home in Orange County, California, put a down payment on a single-screen theater the heart of Historic Downtown Albany, Oregon and moved our family of four a thousand miles away.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/173717/files/20131103224449-249441_134731276601599_6004654_n.jpg?1383547489"" src="""" style=""""/>  </p>
<p></p>
<p>With a welcoming atmosphere and a dedication to affordable pricing, we believe the Pix is an important part of the neighborhood and we hope it will play a prominent role in the continued resurgence of the downtown. Over the past few months we have come to love our new home and are happy that we went “all in”.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Now we turn to our friends and community for the next step.  As many of you probably know, the motion picture business has changed, and the Pix must acquire a digital projector if we are going to continue to serve the community of Albany and surrounding areas.  We could really use your help so that the Pix can remain the place that many have come to love.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We shopped around and the the best deal we have found for a new DCI compliant projector is <b>$36,000</b>.  We are hoping that our friends and community will come together to help us achieve the goal.  In return for your contribution, we are offering some cool rewards.  With a range between $5 and $1,000 we believe there’s a price that will fit any budget. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We really love the T-shirts that we’ve designed with our Pix designer the famous Scott Elliott and our stylish new friends at No Dinx, and wearing it saves you money as well. (Make sure you include a note about male or female cut and what size!)  There’s cups, tubs, stickers, private parties and more.  Even some stuff for your business.  But mostly, if we succeed, you help us continue to provide a locally-owned, friendly, neighborhood alternative to the corporate multiplex, where you can do more than just “see a movie”, you can have an experience!  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>If we surpass our goal</b>, we will use the money to purchase some additional stuff that will enhance the Pix experience, such as a <b>silver screen</b> (giving us the option for 3D) <b>a caramel corn machine</b> (yum), and perhaps even a <b>lighted marquee</b> so that you’ll be able to see what fantastic movies are coming your way!  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond donating, you can also help by getting the word out about the Pix and our campaign.  Indiegogo has some terrific share tools built right in.  We’re hoping that we can all join in and do this thing together! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So what do you say?  Ready to help the Pix project into the future?</p>

A few months ago, we (Denise and Rod Bigner) were thinking about how much we would love to operate a place were people could come together and experience the magic of movies as a community.  We didn’t have much money but we sold our home in Orange County, California, put a down payment on a single-screen theater the heart of Historic Downtown Albany, Oregon and moved our family of four a thousand miles away.

  

With a welcoming atmosphere and a dedication to affordable pricing, we believe the Pix is an important part of the neighborhood and we hope it will play a prominent role in the continued resurgence of the downtown. Over the past few months we have come to love our new home and are happy that we went “all in”.  


Now we turn to our friends and community for the next step.  As many of you probably know, the motion picture business has changed, and the Pix must acquire a digital projector if we are going to continue to serve the community of Albany and surrounding areas.  We could really use your help so that the Pix can remain the place that many have come to love.



What We Need & What You Get

We shopped around and the the best deal we have found for a new DCI compliant projector is $36,000.  We are hoping that our friends and community will come together to help us achieve the goal.  In return for your contribution, we are offering some cool rewards.  With a range between $5 and $1,000 we believe there’s a price that will fit any budget. 





We really love the T-shirts that we’ve designed with our Pix designer the famous Scott Elliott and our stylish new friends at No Dinx, and wearing it saves you money as well. (Make sure you include a note about male or female cut and what size!)  There’s cups, tubs, stickers, private parties and more.  Even some stuff for your business.  But mostly, if we succeed, you help us continue to provide a locally-owned, friendly, neighborhood alternative to the corporate multiplex, where you can do more than just “see a movie”, you can have an experience!  


If we surpass our goal, we will use the money to purchase some additional stuff that will enhance the Pix experience, such as a silver screen (giving us the option for 3D) a caramel corn machine (yum), and perhaps even a lighted marquee so that you’ll be able to see what fantastic movies are coming your way!  


Other Ways You Can Help

Beyond donating, you can also help by getting the word out about the Pix and our campaign.  Indiegogo has some terrific share tools built right in.  We’re hoping that we can all join in and do this thing together!

<h2>THE SHOW</h2>
<p><i>Weed lube, throuple therapy, &amp; one life-altering text message. With an open mind, heart, and vagina, KEEPING MY KIDNEYS challenges the romantic comedy narrative and the roles we play in it. Writer and performer Mindy Raf demystifies love, loss, and sexuality and engages her vulnerable, razor-sharp storytelling style to face the complexities of modern love and leave us asking, “could I ever do that?”</i></p>
<p>KEEPING MY KIDNEYS  had a great debut in NYC this past year with SOLD OUT shows at the PIT Loft and stellar reviews and features by: GO Magazine, Time Out New York, Theatre Is Easy, Effort Lez, Cynical Magazine, and Hy Reviews. <strong>Now we want to share this story with international audiences, and we need your help!</strong></p>

<h2>WHY?</h2>
<p>This show is deeply personal and so important to me.

<p><b>Hart Pulse Dance </b><b>Company </b><b>is celebrating </b><b>our ninth </b><b>year as one of LA's most prominent dance companies by taking </b><b>the show </b><b>on the road for </b><b>our </b><b>first California tour!  </b></p>
<p><b>After wrapping our </b><b>eighth </b><b>and most successful season, we are realizing that now is the perfect time to </b><b>tour and </b><b>share our hard work with other cities who also love dance.  Our board of directors and dancers have chosen the best of the best, most audience-loved works to take to San Francisco, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Visalia and finally back home to Santa Monica</b><b> for our final wrap-up performance</b><b>.  </b></p>
<p><b>Each of these </b><b>cities </b><b>hold</b><b>s its </b><b>own, individual excitement for us!  San Diego and Santa Barbara both </b><b>boast </b><b>dance communities </b><b>we hold </b><b>close to our hearts that have not only </b><b>welcomed us to participate in </b><b>their own festivals and showcases, but have also been </b><b>longtime</b><b> participants </b><b>in </b><b>Hart Pulse Dance </b><b>Company's </b><b>annual MixMatch Dance Festival.  San Francisco is known for </b><b>its </b><b>rich artistic dance community and is the </b><b>farthest </b><b>city we will be reaching on our tour.  Our dancers are so excited to perform in this beautiful city and contact so many </b><b>different </b><b>dance supporters.  </b></p>
<p><b>As the home town of director</b><b>,</b><b> Amanda Hart, Visalia holds a very special place in our tour lineup.  </b><b>The small farm towns of the Central Valley have a warm community of dance enthusiasts who have been requesting Hart Pulse Dance </b><b>Company </b><b>performances for many years now.  We are thrilled to finally be able to bring Miss Hart back to her </b><b>home town </b><b>and present her company </b><b>in the place in which her dance journey began</b><b>.  </b></p>
<p><b>At the end of August </b><b>Hart Pulse Dance </b><b>Company</b><b> will </b><b>present our Ninth </b><b>Annual MixMatch Dance Festival at </b><b>our </b><b>home stage, the Miles Playhouse in Santa Monica</b><b>.  In 2014 we were thrilled when MixMatch was listed by the New York Times in its ""things to do and see this week” feature as one of the eight best things to do around the world for the weekend!   Next year MixMatch </b><b>will not only set the stage for over 60 dance companies from across the United States, but will wrap up </b><b>our California </b><b>tour with </b><b>Hart Pulse Dance Company’s </b><b>final 2015 performance.  </b></p>
<p><b>After tickets sales and silent auction proceeds, we still need your help with production costs, including costumes, theater rentals, travel expenses, liability insurance, dancer pay, videographers and photographers, crew &amp; union pay, advertising and promotion.  </b></p>
<p><b>Our biggest </b><b>expenses </b><b>this year will be dancer compensation, travel expenses and promotion.  Our dancers will be dancing more than they've ever danced before and are so excited to be on so many stages!  This is our first year working with travel expenses and promoting shows from far away.  We are </b><b>an</b><b> LA community</b><b>-</b><b>based company and rely on local connections and footwork to promote our performances.  </b><b>Because we will be venturing outward from Los Angeles for the first time, </b><b>2015 will require a lot of print advertising to assist in getting the word out about Hart Pulse Dance </b><b>Company’s visits to </b><b>these amazing cities.  Newspapers, online ads, posters, thousands of postcards, outreach promotions and so much more will be a vital to </b><b>our </b><b>tour</b><b>’s</b><b> exposure and success.  </b></p>
<p><b>Consistency in performances, quality and presence are essential to helping Hart Pulse Dance Company become a company ultimately recognized as a vital part of the cultural life of Los Angeles, California and the United States.  We want Hart Pulse Dance Company to be a household name; a dance company that audiences look to for solid, beautiful performance that will be around for years to come.  </b></p>
<p><b>Your financial support fuels our mission: Providing affordable, professional, great dance to our community and beyond.  Your physical support, seeing you at our shows, is what we work so hard for.  The verbal encouragement we hear from our audiences fuels us to return year after year.   </b></p>
<p><b>By supporting Hart Pulse’s 2015 season, you go above and beyond in assisting the growth of Hart Pulse Dance Company and dance in California.  You are promoting the creation of a solid contemporary dance company in Los Angeles, allowing stronger roots to be planted in an effort to launch Hart Pulse Dance Company further into the realm of sustainability.  You are, truly, patrons of the arts.</b></p>
<p><b>We've put together some fun ""thank you"" gifts for contributing and assisting our first tour!  We hope you can feel our passion for what we do.  And we hope that you also feel empowered and passionate about dance and Hart Pulse Dance </b><b>Company</b><b>.  Thank you so much for contributing!  We hope to see you throughout our current season at one of our shows.  We know you will love what you see and leave wanting more! </b></p>

Our biggest expenses this year will be dancer compensation, travel expenses and promotion.  Our dancers will be dancing more than they've ever danced before and are so excited to be on so many stages!  This is our first year working with travel expenses and promoting shows from far away.  We are an LA community-based company and rely on local connections and footwork to promote our performances.  Because we will be venturing outward from Los Angeles for the first time, 2015 will require a lot of print advertising to assist in getting the word out about Hart Pulse Dance Company’s visits to these amazing cities.  Newspapers, online ads, posters, thousands of postcards, outreach promotions and so much more will be a vital to our tour’s exposure and success.  
Consistency in performances, quality and presence are essential to helping Hart Pulse Dance Company become a company ultimately recognized as a vital part of the cultural life of Los Angeles, California and the United States.  We want Hart Pulse Dance Company to be a household name; a dance company that audiences look to for solid, beautiful performance that will be around for years to come.  
Your financial support fuels our mission: Providing affordable, professional, great dance to our community and beyond.  Your physical support, seeing you at our shows, is what we work so hard for.  The verbal encouragement we hear from our audiences fuels us to return year after year.   
By supporting Hart Pulse’s 2015 season, you go above and beyond in assisting the growth of Hart Pulse Dance Company and dance in California.  You are promoting the creation of a solid contemporary dance company in Los Angeles, allowing stronger roots to be planted in an effort to launch Hart Pulse Dance Company further into the realm of sustainability.  You are, truly, patrons of the arts.
We've put together some fun ""thank you"" gifts for contributing and assisting our first tour!  We hope you can feel our passion for what we do.  And we hope that you also feel empowered and passionate about dance and Hart Pulse Dance Company.  Thank you so much for contributing!  We hope to see you throughout our current season at one of our shows.  We know you will love what you see and leave wanting more! 
Please share our campaign with your friends and family.  Follow us on Facebook (hart-pulse dance-company) and stay up to speed on when and where we're performing next!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>This is Eurydice</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">In September of 2011, we shared </span><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Eurydice in Market East</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> with audiences for the first time</span> at the Philly Fringe festival. While we felt that the art we were creating was strong, we were still surprised by how much it affected those who got to see it. People <span style=""font-style: italic;"">talked</span> about the piece. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">People </span><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">discovered</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> things about their own society through the piece.</span> Some people even <span style=""font-style: italic;"">came back</span> to see it again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We want to continue <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">the talking.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eurydice in Market East</span> is powerful because it is a found text piece. Here, trapped in her own subway station of an underworld, Eurydice finds a voice to call her own. But as someone who is always spoken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">about</span>, not someone who <span style=""font-style: italic;"">speaks</span> - someone who exists entirely as a figure in the story of another - the only language she has at her disposal is that of the world around her. In short, she does not have recourse to self-generate language. She can only piece together bits of language and phrases she has stumbled on to express herself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Found text. Eurydice tries to explore the big issues with only the language she has found, from poetry to teen magazines. What happens when you try to describe life, heartbreak, art, and existence itself with the language of Shakespeare to car advertisements to the sound of an escalator? As Eurydice struggles to understand her story, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">we begin to see how our own world understands love, music, death, all those big questions.</span> We see how our culture interprets - even packages - those ideas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And that is why the inability to generate one's own language leads to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">so much </span><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">talking</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>A New Station</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We want to take this conversation to New York - to interact with a new audience, to listen to more people. We want to be able to share what we found and become part of the discussion that develops. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Eurydice will hit the stages of New York City in mid-June of 2012</span> to continue to spark conversation about culture and language and what it means to live and love and maybe even die. We want to grow with our audience through asking each other the big questions. We want this art to grow into new pieces that can <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">engage our communities.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We suspect that all artists wish that their work could be separated from the constraints of money. That art could be financially accessible to larger audiences because there were fewer debts to pay up the chain. That no one ever had to choose between integrity of vision and cost. But because this is not the case, we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here are a list of things of things we need money for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our largest cost will be <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">renting the space</span>. Though we have found an artist-centric space that tries to keep its rents as low as possible, we still need around $1000 for a 3 or 4 day run.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Transportation</span> to and from NYC. We should be able to travel as a group there once - before tech - and return once, but it still ads up, even on discount buses.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Marketing</span>. It is more important than we like to admit, and more costly. But it is necessary if we want the conversation to happen. Theatre is about bringing people together, which can only happen if people know when and where to go.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Insurance</span> is pricy, and we always hope we won't have claim any of it. But it is important. Spaces require proof of insurance before they will rent to you, and with good reason.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We will need to pay for these as part of producing this show and any future shows. Whatever you contribute will go directly into funding these types of costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>As a Thank You</h3>
<p>Everyone who contributes will get a personal shout-out through our Facebook page. We will also list you as one of our supporters on our blog (QWERTY contributor).

In September of 2011, we shared Eurydice in Market East with audiences for the first time at the Philly Fringe festival. While we felt that the art we were creating was strong, we were still surprised by how much it affected those who got to see it. People talked about the piece. People discovered things about their own society through the piece. Some people even came back to see it again.
 
We want to continue the talking.
 
Eurydice in Market East is powerful because it is a found text piece. Here, trapped in her own subway station of an underworld, Eurydice finds a voice to call her own. But as someone who is always spoken about, not someone who speaks - someone who exists entirely as a figure in the story of another - the only language she has at her disposal is that of the world around her. In short, she does not have recourse to self-generate language. She can only piece together bits of language and phrases she has stumbled on to express herself.
 
Found text. Eurydice tries to explore the big issues with only the language she has found, from poetry to teen magazines. What happens when you try to describe life, heartbreak, art, and existence itself with the language of Shakespeare to car advertisements to the sound of an escalator? As Eurydice struggles to understand her story, we begin to see how our own world understands love, music, death, all those big questions. We see how our culture interprets - even packages - those ideas.
 
And that is why the inability to generate one's own language leads to so much talking.

We want to take this conversation to New York - to interact with a new audience, to listen to more people. We want to be able to share what we found and become part of the discussion that develops.

About TU Dance and Studio 2</h4>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;"">TU Dance is a non-profit contemporary dance company and school founded in St.

need your financial support to be able to purchase new music and dance

    Hi there!
Thanks
for watching our video! We are so excited for TU Dance Center Studio 2 to open late June. The
new space will be great for the expanding youth program we are a part of
and which offers youth of all different backgrounds access to a world class
professional dance program. 




TU Dance has raised enough funding to build Studio 2 from very generous foundations, but we need to raise money for
much needed equipment, such as:



piano & drums
sound
system


instructional media/TV cart
sprung dance floor & surface



portable barres

mirrors




Please donate so that we can bring the studio to life! 
So, what is TU Dance Center? 
It's a unique space where young dancers like us get to learn, practice, perform, and work.  And it's the home of the TU Dance, so we work alongside professional dancers and musicians who will be joining us in Studio 2.  TU Dance has opened up so many opportunities for us. It's not every day that young dancers get the chance to travel and dance in cities like San Francisco and New York, and it's all thanks to the training we get at TU Dance Center.




How you can help
Please donate as much you can because any amount helps!
In return for your generous support, you'll receive a lot of shoutouts from us--check out the perks area to see what you get. More than anything, though, we'll be very thankful to you for helping us to bring the new TU Dance Center Studio 2 to life! And if you can't give, we would be delighted if you shared our campaign. Email it. Share it on Facebook. Tweet it! However you like, it doesn't matter to us as long as it's getting there with your help.
Thank you so much for considering, and thank you for bringing TU Dance Center Studio 2 to life!
Sincerely,

First of all...
Life is overrated is produced by THE SHADES OF GRAY - a multi arts organization with the goal of exploring and honoring the ""in between"" of the common human experience. (www.theshadesofgray.org)
This is a very special spring for The Shades of Gray: We are very proud to launch our first Artist Exchange Program!

So here we are:
Rayka Kobiella: A German director, and playwright, with an original work in her pocket.
Zoe Hutmacher: A German actress, dragged directly to New York from the Berlin stages and back again.
Miriam Ibrahim: A German actress, who arrived in New York a couple of years ago and is now the heart of Shades of Gray.
Julian Juaquin: An American actor and the rooster in the henhouse. 
Vanessa FitzGerald: An American actress who jumped on board at the very last minute.
Then there is the creative team: 
Jonas Gerberding: A German stage technician who enlightens our stage.
James Wagner: A German-American translator who decoded our endless German sentences.
Leonie Ettinger: A German expat who is assistant directing and bringing some German order into the production. 

What is it about?
LIFE IS OVERRATED is a story about the search for a purpose in life and how it feels to lose one's ambition to pursue it. On the quest of trying to make life meaningful and while seeking to retain independence of our own thoughts, we are faced with a myriad of good and bad advice from friends. There are decisions we are proud of and the ones we regret. Our inner voice is seperated into many small voices; the angels, the devils and the inbetweens. When colliding they could drive us crazy...
 
""I’m forever screwing things up. I barely start to feel comfortable with myself, and then it’s over. I talk too loud, I wear something garish, I belch at the dinner table, spill something, blush, fall in love, get engaged, I’m lost, I stick out, I try to fit in, I eat too much, I don’t eat enough, I forget people’s names. I’m no good at anything. These human networks. No good. I can’t do it. I’m not only not good at it, I’m fucking terrible at it.
 

So what now?
In many ways this is our first time – Shades of Gray's first artist-exchange program, the first German-American collaboration for all of us, and our first attempt on Indiegogo...scary, right?
 

So this is what we need:
We're not asking for much – ideally $1000 but every little penny will help us cover our bases. We hope to be able to raise enough to pay for the rent of our beautiful theatre space, the funky rehearsal room, our tech equip, stage design, costumes and, of course, our metro cards! And what we would really love: starting our next project without debts!
 

And this is what you'll get for it!!!
 
You'll love our perks!
 
$1 - A “Thank You” in the program and a ""Love you – email"".
 
$10 – A“Thank You” in the program and a postcard with all our signatures - you can choose between NYC and Berlin.
 
$20 – A “Thank You” in the program and an autographed photo from the entire cast!
 
$50 - A “Thank You” in the program, an autographed photo from the entire cast and a DVD of the play.
$100 - you can keep the ""Life is overrated”- sign from our trailer in addition to the DVD of the play, a “Thank You” in the program and the autographed photo from the entire cast!

No Holds Barred </span><br/><p>Botoxed hipsters, invented savages, missing nuns, loves treason and  Harriet Tubman--this year’s Alcyone Festival puts a new spin on  overlooked classics. We asked five contemporary women to rework/adapt/sample/remix plays written by classical women, celebrating over a thousand years of writing by women.</p><p>On average only twenty percent of plays produced each year are written by women. In Chicago in 2009, only 19% were. The percentage of women  produced on broadway last year was virtually unchanged from 100 years  ago.

No one is  really re-imagining Maria de Zaya y Sotomayor or Anna Cora Mowatt. (At least not that we're aware of.) Looking at works using/adapting/sampling  plays written by women from Hrosvitha (c. 935 to c. 1002) through 1870,  our hope is to celebrate both new and (really) old writers and see how the lineage of female playwrights over the past thousand years can  inspire and inform contemporary audiences and artists.</p><p>Instead of picking scripts that have already been written, we picked some of our favorite writers and took off the brakes. While we couldn't afford to commission, we could commit to producing. And that's what we did. Amongst all the talk of development hell, etc, we're putting some of our favorite writers in the driver’s seat, and seeing what happens. The only rules the writers had were: it has to be based in some way off a work by a female playwright written before 1870 and it had to be ready  to go into rehearsal in April. No holds barred.</p>
<h3>How You can Help</h3>
<p>Currently  the single biggest obstacle is space. Rehearsal spaces and performance space for fully mounting a five show festival are about $10,000 which is our goal. Other funding will take care of paying people, sets, costumes, lights etc. However helping to create a safe space for these extraordinary women to soar is the biggest way you can help. </p>

Looking at works using/adapting/sampling  plays written by women from Hrosvitha (c. 935 to c. 1002) through 1870,  our hope is to celebrate both new and (really) old writers and see how the lineage of female playwrights over the past thousand years can  inspire and inform contemporary audiences and artists.Instead of picking scripts that have already been written, we picked some of our favorite writers and took off the brakes. While we couldn't afford to commission, we could commit to producing. And that's what we did. Amongst all the talk of development hell, etc, we're putting some of our favorite writers in the driver’s seat, and seeing what happens. The only rules the writers had were: it has to be based in some way off a work by a female playwright written before 1870 and it had to be ready  to go into rehearsal in April. No holds barred.
How You can Help
Currently  the single biggest obstacle is space. Rehearsal spaces and performance space for fully mounting a five show festival are about $10,000 which is our goal. Other funding will take care of paying people, sets, costumes, lights etc. However helping to create a safe space for these extraordinary women to soar is the biggest way you can help.

<h3>What's the Big Idea?</h3>
<p><strong>Tree Project started with a wink and a parade.</strong> Mandy, an acrobat, and Patrick, a musician, got together to jam in a tree during a spring festival back in '09 -- and that's when we realized how amazing trees are. How they invite you to think about the big questions and the little ones, have fun, make art, and connect with other people.</p>
<p>So we started inviting our friends -- more artists, more climbers, more musicians, to come by and stage structured-improvisational aerial performances in community settings, in trees -- <strong>Tree Project.</strong></p>
<p>Last summer we went to York, PA and worked with RAW art collective, who invited <em>their</em> friends, artists and non-artists, to make an amazing day of collaborative, intiguing, spontaneous art (visual, musical, edible, danceable) with a Tree Dance in the middle -- a <strong>Jamboree. </strong></p>
<p>Now we've been inspired to make more Jamborees happen, and we need your help to do it. <strong>We're hitting the road from July 10th to August 15th this year, travelling the southeast, and staging tree dances all along the way.</strong></p>
<p>So far, we have local collaborators in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Chatanooga, New Orleans, and Austin, TX. If you can help us get there, we'll hold events in each city, record our impressions, and scrapbook our experiences for all to see!</p>
<p>And we will have expanded the network of connections among artists and each other, artists and lay-folk, and artists and thier environments in a way that's full of <strong>summertime fun!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>We need fuel in our tanks and in our bellies.</strong> To get from NYC to the southeast and back agian takes roughly $700 in gas and tolls, and to feed all four us for the month we'll be on the road takes about twice that.</p>
<p>The rest we intend to use for safety equipment (ropes, gloves, etc.), lights, and other day-to-day incidentals. If we don't happen to get full funding, your support will go toward the same things -- we'll just shorten the trip.</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>We'd be so excited to have you as a friend!</strong> And to show you how happy we are to have you behind us, we have so many tokens of gratitude -- from friendship bracelets, to specially made songs, to dessert parties, to a full-on jamboree just for you!</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> . . .is huge. Because it's about connection and spontaneity, this is the kind of project that works best in-person. Your contribution translates directly into how far we can go. The more help we get, the farther we can travel, the more people we can meet, and the more jamborees we can have.</p>
<p>More jamborees =  a ton of people (including us) energized and reaching out to each other and playing outside and sharing their passions. What could be better?</p>

<p><strong>Collaborate with Us: </strong>Do you paint/draw/play/film/dance/create? Tell us what you do and where you are, and we'll structure you in to the relevant jamboree session. This is what it's all about, folks.</p>
<p><strong>Offer a Space: </strong>If you have a space in any of the cities mentioned or along the way, with climbable trees, be in touch! We're happy to climb more!</p>
<p><strong>Offer a Meal: </strong>Since the bulk of our funding is going to food, this is a great way to help!</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Alan Dilworth. I am a theatre director and co-Artistic Director of Sheep No Wool, an award winning indie-theatre company based out of Toronto, Canada. This June, Sheep No Wool is bringing world-renowned master playwright Edward Bond to Toronto for a festival celebrating his 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary as a playwright.  We are a small indie company with no infrastructure creating a one-time festival for one of the world’s most acclaimed independent artistic spirits.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a passion project.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The festival takes place in Toronto and other locations across Southern Ontario from June 12-20<sup>th</sup>. The festival consists of eleven encounters featuring over fifty Canadian theatre artists and twelve theatre companies in ten days. In the spirit of Bond’s work we are keeping ticket prices affordable to ensure the participation of youth, and to make engagement for individuals at multiple events, possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need your help to pull this off.     </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution can help make possible this extraordinary opportunity for Canadian audiences and artists to engage in a meeting of minds with one of world's greatest living theatre artists. Your contribution will ensure that all eleven encounters we are programming can be carried out as planned: six workshop readings of Bond's works, a workshop presentation of Bond's play <em>Have I None </em>with the collaboration of Bond himself before a live audience, a Symposium featuring Edward Bond and UK director Chris Cooper, and an acclaimed Ryerson Theatre School remount production of Bond's epic play <em>The Bundle</em>, with a festival finale political theatre cabaret <em>The Wrecking Ball</em>. <em></em> </p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">“I want to set light to people's souls.”</h3>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>Edward Bond is one of the most important and prolific post-war playwrights. The Royal Court Theatre staged Bond's<em> Saved</em> in 1965. The play created a national scandal, which was instrumental in the abolition of censorship of the English stage, and established Bond as a major British playwright. He has written more than 50 plays, including<em> Lear, The Sea, Bingo, The Woman, Restoration, The War Plays </em>and<em> The Paris Pentad</em>. Many of his plays have attained the status of radical classics. Bond's influence on young writers is prodigious. The Abbey Theatre (Dublin) described him as one of the most influential English dramatists of all time. This season there were four acclaimed productions of Bond's plays in major British theatres. </p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>Bond's work challenges us to consider the nature of our humanity and the dangerous social consequences of injustice - which now become increasingly urgent. In an age of illusion, rampant consumerism, and addiction to diversion and spectacle, his plays command us to look at how we are blindly corroborating in the destruction of our environment, our society, and our humanity. Bond’s prophetic works and dramatic theories provide a blueprint for the re-vitalization of drama and it's place in society. His work restores drama's central role as a voice that cries for justice in a world where the abuses of authority are becoming increasingly elusive and unchecked.</p>

<p>We need to raise $10,000 to make our programming possible. Our goal is to raise $5,000 with this indiegogo campaign. Our fantastic partners have already made  generous in kind donations, but a number of expenses remain which require cash flow. The $5,000 raised here would go towards:</p>

of the Theatre Drama Desk 2007 winner Austin Pendleton says ""Mud is
a young Steppenwolf."" We found our name on Thanksgiving and were
officially born on Christmas Eve 2009. Like any toddler we are
exploring, growing, crawling, walking, rocket to the moon-ing. 

What
We've Done: 

At
age 1:
our first project was a A
Streetcar Named Desire at
The Cherry Pit, New York,
summer
2010, with Jen and actors like Toshiji Takeshima who met at HB Studio
in Austin Pendleton's advanced scene study class and decided with
Austin's encouragement to follow a dream and do this play out in the

An jeder Straßenecke sieht man sie: völlig anteilnahmslos starren sie auf kleine Geräte in ihren Händen. Bekommen nichts mehr von der Welt um sie herum mit. Sind raus aus dem Leben.Das Blöde ist: ""Sie"" – das sind wir.Und wie sollen wir Kindern einen halbwegs verantwortungsvollen Umgang mit modernen Medien bebiegen, wenn wir es selber kaum gebacken kriegen?

Thanks for visiting our indiegogo page.

We are a community of artists and cultural workers who produce an annual international performance festival in Kigali, Rwanda. The festival is called Centre x Centre and it aims to share works and ways of working around civic and aesthetic experimentation. Started in 2008 by Hope Azeda, Carole Karemera and Erik Ehn, we've hosted writing and performance workshops, hip hop, Noh theater, comedy, dance-theater, performance art and drama from Belarus, Afghanistan, Canada, US, Uganda, Mexico and Rwanda.

Centre x Centre 

Ishyo Art Centre will host the festival from August 4 to August 6 2011. Mornings, participant artists share strategies for responding to violence through dance, performance or writing workshops. The afternoons provide space either for continuation of workshops or readings and discussion of new plays. The evenings offer concrete examples of peace-building through performance. The whole weekend is free and open to the public. 

Hope Azeda, the lead producer in Rwanda, has requested $1600 to widen access to this festival in Kigali. Even though it is free, there are still barriers that limit access to the work. The funds will go towards publicizing the festival, transport for schools to attend performances, and technical support for local artists.  We need your help in meeting Hope's request.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Fox Valley Repertory Performing Arts Academy is home to over 1,000 local youth students who are either learning the arts for the first time, building self-confidence through performance techniques, or fine tuning their stage talents.  With the growing number of classes, camps and workshops being offered to the community, it is time to create a true home for our students and parents.</p>
</div>
<h3>Our DIY Project </h3>
<p>With your help, Fox Valley Rep wants to create a rehearsal room in their very own administrative building!  While performances will still take place at Pheasant Run Resort, we want students to have one main space for their classes.  This space will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy and accessible parking within steps of our reherasal room doors</li>
<li>A small waiting room for parents</li>
<li>Carpeted rehearsal space with mirrors, white boards, and a piano</li>
<li>Steps away from Culver's: great for grabbing a beverage, meal, or cool treat while you're waiting!</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Fox Valley Repertory Performing Arts Academy is home to over 1,000 local youth students who are either learning the arts for the first time, building self-confidence through performance techniques, or fine tuning their stage talents.  With the growing number of classes, camps and workshops being offered to the community, it is time to create a true home for our students and parents.

Our DIY Project 
With your help, Fox Valley Rep wants to create a rehearsal room in their very own administrative building!  While performances will still take place at Pheasant Run Resort, we want students to have one main space for their classes.  This space will include:

Easy and accessible parking within steps of our reherasal room doors
A small waiting room for parents
Carpeted rehearsal space with mirrors, white boards, and a piano
Steps away from Culver's: great for grabbing a beverage, meal, or cool treat while you're waiting!

<h2><strong>TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!!</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Movement fills our human spirit as it breaths through our body and brings sensation, richeness and awareness to life. Art opens our eyes and minds and enriches our senses; we experience things never experienced before, even though they were always there in front of us. Dance artfully moves us physically and mentally and forms a vital foundation for greater self development, either as a participant or observer. Consider the bleak prospect of our world without art. <strong>Help make a difference; together we can move a little piece of the world</strong></p>
<p><br/>Atelier Favela is a small cultural center in the village of Ticuantepe<br/>Managua, Nicaragua. It began with two artists who shared a vision: helping<br/>people in need, while providing them with an opportunity for creativity<br/>and selfsufficiency. Children disadvantaged by poverty are invited to the<br/>cultural center for exploring and participating in various art forms,<br/>including dance. Teenagers and adults from the village are provided<br/>necessary creative tools for making crafts that they sell. Fundamental<br/>self-esteem lifts their human spirit through experiencing self-suffciency<br/>with the added joy of creativity. The center however is most importantly an<br/>after school program staffed by volunteer artists who provide disadvantaged<br/>children with constant encouragement and teach them how to<br/>live a sustainable life and reach a viable future. <strong>These children of</strong><br/><strong>Atelier Favela are my focus.</strong><br/><br/><strong>My commitment is this:</strong> with your support and success of this fundraiser, I<br/>will take all of my dance education, experience and energies to the<br/>children of Atelier Favela and plunge myself in their pool of youthful,<br/>limitless potential. My desire and personal reward is the hope that my waves will<br/>radiate through these children and move them in unison toward brighter<br/>shores carried by inspiration,<br/>wonderment, and encouragment.<br/><br/>Dance opens my eyes to the beauty and fragility of life, and it motivates<br/>me to look and move forward, to see beyond and at the same time humbles me<br/>with the hard work of the present that signals the journey is its own<br/>reward.

<strong>queerSpawn</strong> is a new play by <strong>Mallery Avidon</strong> that <strong>A Collection of Shiny Objects</strong> has been working to bring to the New York stage since the summer of 2012. It tells the story of The Kid, a 14-year-old, starting high school in a small town. Everyone knows he has 2 moms, and that's just the beginning of his trouble. While dodging bullies, The Kid invents a group of imaginary friends, including sex/relationship advice columnist Dan Savage and Dr. McSteamy from tv's 'Grey's Anatomy', with whom to share his troubles.

<h3>What's this show?</h3>
<p><em><strong>Vulture-Wally</strong></em> is a dance piece that uses spoken word, song, and dialog to create a long-form, physicalized poem about who owns our bodies and who authors our stories. Based on an old Austrian serial novel, the dance dissects a melodramatic hero(ine) by resurrecting her body one part at a time.</p>
<p>We've broken the story into chapters, each one a different part of the body. We've deconstructed the language into dance and poetry and gesture. And we've cast the lead character as 4 dancers - Sweeney, Siobhan Burke, Lydia Chrisman, and Tara Willis. There's no narrative left here.</p>
<p>Like an album of music, <em>Vulture-Wally</em> goes from chapter to chapter (or song to song, or scene to scene) thematically, building on the previous emotion and creating texture in beauty and humor, rather than trying to answer big questions or resolve a fictional plot.</p>

<h3>Where are contributions going?</h3>
<p>Short answer: to the artists.</p>
<p>Longer answer: this show costs well over $3,000 to produce. These costs are offset by ticket sales, our own contibutions (Jeffrey &amp; Jillian's), donations from this Indiegogo campaign, and in-kind donations (like the rehearsal residencies we received in 2012 from Immediate Medium and Lower Manhattan Cultural Council). We pay all of the performers and creators as best we can, because they are trained, talented people giving a lot of time and amazing work. They deserve compensation.</p>
<p>We also must rent rehearsal space, buy lights and set pieces and costumes and props. Any gift you give can help us pay for these things, and should this project finish in the black, that is simply more money we can give to the artistic collaborators &amp; crew.</p>

</div></div>","What's this show?
Vulture-Wally is a dance piece that uses spoken word, song, and dialog to create a long-form, physicalized poem about who owns our bodies and who authors our stories. Based on an old Austrian serial novel, the dance dissects a melodramatic hero(ine) by resurrecting her body one part at a time.
We've broken the story into chapters, each one a different part of the body. We've deconstructed the language into dance and poetry and gesture. And we've cast the lead character as 4 dancers - Sweeney, Siobhan Burke, Lydia Chrisman, and Tara Willis. There's no narrative left here.
Like an album of music, Vulture-Wally goes from chapter to chapter (or song to song, or scene to scene) thematically, building on the previous emotion and creating texture in beauty and humor, rather than trying to answer big questions or resolve a fictional plot.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey Guys and Gals</p>
<p>My name is Davon Magwood, I am a stand up comic. </p>
<p>This June --- I'm embarking on a huge DIY grass roots stand-up comedy tour across the Country!  The shows are already booked! By the end, I'll have made  thousands laughed and gather stories from comics from all walks of life!  But only if your help gets me there.</p>
<p>Watch the video -- I want you to be my tour sponsor. With your support I'll be able to live my dream and get to explore the national comedy scene while I travel.</p>
<p>Why sponsor me? Because laughter is worth it, and I can't do it without you. This tour involves 3,000+ miles of travel to faraway cities that are in need of a good time. Being my sponsor will help cover those expenses -- gas, maintenance, food, hotels, promo, and merchandise -- so I can get to the funny part! </p>
<p>I plan to post videos weekly and host live chats while on the road so you will get to see what I see as I explore this great nation! </p>
<p>Please take a look, and give generously every bit helps. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h3>What we need and why.</h3>

<div>
<p>I was inspired years ago by the ""Comedians of Comedy"" and how the capture the tour from being on the road a performing on stage.</p>
<p>What I am doing is bring my stand up comedy to 30 plus cities and towns. But I'm also going to interview the comics from those areas I think capturing those stories wil not only help comics who are new but maybe inspire some comics are down on themselves.

We are literally short 2 round trip tickets plus baggage fees!  Please support this project!</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>The Shows and Their History</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>In the Spring of 2010, Ghost Road was asked to </strong><strong>host</strong><strong> an evening with three Polish artists, Marcin Liber, Malgorzata Sikorska-Miszczuk, and Woytek Staas, and also present a reading of Sikorska-Miszczuk's ""Pantofelnik's Suitcase"".  That following summer, while in Warsaw seeing plays and meeting with Polish artists, Ghost Road's Katharine Noon and Mark Seldis spent a day with the playwright and began a friendship which carried over into the fall of 2011, when the company was asked to present a workshop of ""Pantofelnik's Suitcase"" to coincide with Sikorska-Miszczuk's brief residency at USC.  Based on the response from the playwright, as well as officials from the Polish Consulate and Ministry of Culture, we were invited to bring a full production of the play to the annual Korczak Festival in Warsaw in October 2013. </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>In the meantime, Ghost Road completed work on our latest ensemble-devised work, ""The Bargain and the Butterfly"" and presented the </strong><strong>world premiere of the piece in</strong><strong> March and April of this year.  </strong><strong>Having participated in a highly successful residency in Poland with lauded Polish ensemble Studium Teatralne in 2011, there was tremendous interest in having Ghost Road present our original work in Warsaw. As both plays can be performed with essentially the same actors, this became the perfect opportunity to introduce our new piece to European audiences.  We are very excited to be launching this new work in Poland, a place that has become very dear to us all.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>The Korczak Festival is paying a small fee and providing lodging, with additional hospitality from the Adam Mickiewicz Institute and the Polish Consulate in Los Angeles.  With that support, plus some fundraising we have already done, we have all our expenses and </strong><strong>7 </strong><strong>of our plane tickets covered.  </strong><strong>Please help us make this dream a reality by contributing today! </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What will the money go towards:</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>- </strong><strong>2 Round-Trip tickets to Warsaw</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>- Baggage Fees</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Every cent you contribute will go towards this show.  $3,840 is the bare minimum needed to make the rest of this trip a reality, so if we can raise more it will go toward reimbursing the very expensive flights for this show as well as purchasing props and additional production equipment.  <br/></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>This trip is going to be a truly life changing and unforgettable experience for all of us involved.  Your support means so much and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. </strong></p>

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Ian O'Brien. I am a professional actor and playwright from the Halton (Ontario) region and a founding member of The Failed Magician's League; A Creative Collective of young and talented minds from the Halton region and beyond. This summer, tFML is taking my show, ""Placid Ends At Mothballed Beginnings"" from Georgetown, across Canada, to the wonderful city of Nanaimo, B.C., as part of the Fringetastic! Theatre Festival from August 16th to the 26th. <br/>We need your help to make this endeavour a resounding success. </p>
<p>Not one soul in the cast, crew, or design team is over twenty three. This production is truly a <em>youth</em> creation, and one that seeks to change forever how you and yours view abstract theatre. </p>
<p>Placid Ends, as it has come to be known, is my first play, written when I was seventeen years old. <span>Three pairs of people and their god inhabit an area of space as close to nowhere as possible. They suffer and mourn in chilling isolation, in the end wholly aware that the world is not but a cycle of detriment and loss, played out to the tune of the divin</span><span>e. The show has been praised for its bold choice of aesthetic, and topic matter: The creeping sensation that our actions and struggles have no meaning or bearing on the outcome of the world. <br/>It's a comedy!</span></p>
<p>We are asking the people of the internet for a thousand dollars to help us get this show out west. It has been such an incredible honour for us and our town to represent all of Eastern Canada at this festival, and we would be proud to count you as a supporter. </p>
<p>All funding will go towards accomodation costs for the minors on our roster. We have three members under 18, and we want to make sure they get a guaranteed place to sleep for the entire run of the show, and a healthy three meals a day. After their needs are taken care of, any remaining funds would go towards accomodations for those members over 18.</p>
<p>When we make it out there, we promise to put on a show so wonderfully different than anything that's been seen in Canadian theatre for quite some time. A change is in the air. The young artists of Canada have a drive and a new determination. Who knows? Perhaps with your help this show can acheive some small level of success for the budding youngsters who will drive that new dream forward. </p>
<p>Of course, donations do not go without their perks. We have devised some super epic ""Placid Ends"" themed rewards for all you generous donors out there. <strong>Such items include hand written letters, documentary videos, props, pictures, and those super generous donors out there will have the option of a dedicated song sent by email OR a dinner theatre evening brought to your door by The Failed Magician's League.</strong></p>

<p>We hope that you choose to support our endeavour, and remember, the only way to save Theatre is to pave the way for those that come next.</p>

Aujourd'hui,
la compagnie vous propose de participer à la production du <i>Bourgeois
Gentilhomme</i>,
et plus particulièrement à la création de ses costumes. Nous
proposons une véritable création de costumes pour la première
version de la pièce et avons pris le parti de situer le spectacle
dans deux époques. Les pièces du XVIIe siècle seront resituées
dans le patrimoine historique de nos costumes régionaux avec des
couleurs, des volumes, des lignes sobres et des textiles qui
racontent le rang social. Les costumes du XXIe siècle seront, eux,
un reflet de la mode vue sur nos écrans. Il s'agira ainsi de vêtir
18 comédiens qui interpréteront 55 personnages, pour un total de
356 pièces de costumes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Celles-ci
seront réalisées grâce à vous sous la direction du costumier Erig
Le Goff qui encadrera quatre équipes. Trois classes du lycée Lesven
et le centre social de Bellevue se chargeront des costumes d'époque,
tandis que les costumes contemporains seront pris en charge par
l'atelier mis en place par la Maison du Théâtre. Côté
professionnel, deux ateliers viennent rejoindre le projet : Pourpre
Indigo Costumes et l'atelier Salaun. Enfin, nous recevrons l'aide
d'étudiants en Techniques des Métiers du Spectacle du lycée Louis
Armand de Locminé. Ceux-ci seront également en charge de
l'habillage pendant le spectacle.</p>
<p>
Les
exigences et l'ambition de ce projet nécessitent des moyens que la
compagnie ne peut réunir sans votre soutien. Pour que ce projet
puisse exister et soit aussi beau que nous voudrions vous le
présenter, participez dès maintenant !

Notre projetEn 2014, le Théâtre de la Coche et son metteur en scène
Steeve Brudey, en partenariat avec la Maison du Théâtre, renouent avec la tradition en présentant la comédie-ballet de
Molière : Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme. Cette fusion de comédie, de
chant et de danse offrira au spectateur une réflexion sur notre époque de
consommation, d'apparences et de prêt-à-penser. Au travers de ce classique, les
rencontres entre rêve et réalité, scène et coulisses, XVIIème et XXIème siècles
seront permanentes.L'aventure duBourgeoiss'articulera en deux grandes étapes : Le
Théâtre de la Coche montera ainsi, au cours d'ateliers à la Maison du Théâtre
de Brest, une première version du spectacle avec des amateurs. Ils seront
accompagnés et formés tout au long de cette année par les professionnels de la
compagnie. La pièce sera ensuite reprise par l'équipe professionnelle.La première version sera jouée cinq fois, du 13 au 17 mai
2014, au Stella à Brest, dans le cadre du Festival des Humanités organisé par
le Quartz. La seconde version tournera par la suite en Bretagne.Participez !
