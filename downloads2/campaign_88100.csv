<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>1. Delivery: We're working on a complex app that involves organizing thousands of audio commands. It's bound to get complicated. Luckily Patrice has already gone through funding and building a hardware/software prototype, so you know she can get the job done.</p>
<p>2. Synchronization: One of the unique and exciting aspects of the TERP app is the ability to send commands to multiple people and have them receive it all at once.

We're also planning on getting some heavy-duty dedicated servers. It's listed as a stretch goal, but we'll be reaching out to interested advertisers and investors as well.</p>
<p>Patrice has been working with the TERP system for 10 years, testing and seeing what works best.

 you with a fully-vetted driver service that will take you home in your

your shofer once you’ve been dropped off). </p><p>We want to help you, your friends and, yes, even your foes, enjoy a worry-free night out AND get home safely. Did you know that one in every three people are affected by DUI? So why do we continue to drive? Our research has shown that many drivers charged with a DUI said they chose to get behind the wheel because they were unwilling to abandon their vehicle in an unfamiliar area and then deal with the hassle of retrieving it the next day. With DShofer, we have created a practical solution that can save lives and prevent spending thousands .<br/></p><p>Help support our campaign and try DShofer!

</div></div>","Why we created DShoferWith DShofer, no man — and no vehicle — is left behind. Our app connects
 you with a fully-vetted driver service that will take you home in your 
own car (while a second driver will follow closely behind to re-collect 
your shofer once you’ve been dropped off). We want to help you, your friends and, yes, even your foes, enjoy a worry-free night out AND get home safely. Did you know that one in every three people are affected by DUI? So why do we continue to drive? Our research has shown that many drivers charged with a DUI said they chose to get behind the wheel because they were unwilling to abandon their vehicle in an unfamiliar area and then deal with the hassle of retrieving it the next day. With DShofer, we have created a practical solution that can save lives and prevent spending thousands .Help support our campaign and try DShofer! We are funding a free ride night in select cities where you'll be able to try the DShofer app and service for free.Don't want to wait? Try the app now. (Service available in St. Louis and Silicon Valley. Kansas City service available by fall 2015.)

<div>We believe that good design is functional and timeless, it should be built to last for years to come. We're on a mission to end the wasteful trend of 'consumable' electronics that are inoperable or obsolete after two years of use. <a href=""http://www.puzzlephone.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PuzzlePhone</a> is the first smartphone that's made to stand the test of time. We've separated the phone into three essential modules - the Heart, the Spine, and the Brain - that can be upgraded, replaced, and repaired for maximum longevity and performance.</div>

<a href=""http://www.puzzlephone.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PuzzlePhone</a> is more than just a device - it's a platform, an ecosystem of interchangeable parts that are designed to be changed and upgraded with the times. It's the first truly sustainable smartphone - one that's not meant to be thrown out and replaced in full with every mobile carrier contract. If you break your screen, you can easily replace the Spine. If your battery dies, a new Heart will make your phone run like new. Want to increase your storage, a quick switch of the Brain will give you the upgrade you need. <p></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.puzzlephone.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PuzzlePhone</a> is designed in Finland
and co-created in Europe – so our R&amp;D, testing, and manufacturing remain
in Europe. Our key partners Grant4Com (one stop shop for product development)
and Haltian (the hardware design – mobile device masterclass), Antcore and PS Audio share our philosophy. All based
in Oulu, Finland’s Silicon Valley, they are leveraging the full Oulu ecosystem
for R&amp;D, manufacturing, and assembly. Designed in Hämeenlinna. Built in Oulu. And although <a href=""http://www.puzzlephone.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PuzzlePhone</a> is, at the

<p>An Indiegogo flexible campaign means that we can keep the money even if we do not reach the goal. But that doesn’t mean that the project is going to disappear if the goal is not reached.

</div></div>","Buying a new phone every time you drop it or the battery dies is now a thing of the past. PuzzlePhone is the first smartphone that’s built to last. It’s kind of like a puzzle… except it’s a phone. PuzzlePhone modular, with three easy-to-change modules, making it 100% upgradeable, repairable, & dare we say, future-proof. 








We believe that good design is functional and timeless, it should be built to last for years to come. We're on a mission to end the wasteful trend of 'consumable' electronics that are inoperable or obsolete after two years of use. PuzzlePhone is the first smartphone that's made to stand the test of time. We've separated the phone into three essential modules - the Heart, the Spine, and the Brain - that can be upgraded, replaced, and repaired for maximum longevity and performance.











PuzzlePhone is more than just a device - it's a platform, an ecosystem of interchangeable parts that are designed to be changed and upgraded with the times. It's the first truly sustainable smartphone - one that's not meant to be thrown out and replaced in full with every mobile carrier contract. If you break your screen, you can easily replace the Spine. If your battery dies, a new Heart will make your phone run like new. Want to increase your storage, a quick switch of the Brain will give you the upgrade you need.

We are the Androids you’ve been looking
for. A full stack startup from entrepreneurs
with over 200 years of combined experience.






















PuzzlePhone is designed in Finland
and co-created in Europe – so our R&D, testing, and manufacturing remain
in Europe. Our key partners Grant4Com (one stop shop for product development)
and Haltian (the hardware design – mobile device masterclass), Antcore and PS Audio share our philosophy. All based
in Oulu, Finland’s Silicon Valley, they are leveraging the full Oulu ecosystem
for R&D, manufacturing, and assembly. Designed in Hämeenlinna. Built in Oulu. And although PuzzlePhone is, at the
moment, made in Europe, we're most proud of the fact that our full business
ecosystem is fully replicable elsewhere - making it a truly local system. 











Having
supporters believing in us we are confident we can bring longer lasting product, while minimizing the consumption of resources.
We are
grateful to our business angels and public institutions Tekes (the Finnish
Funding Agency for innovation) and EU H2020 Sustainably Smart program grants to
bring our idea closer to you.

</h3><p><b>Zdat –your 300% durable lightning cable
with fully reversible USB plug for your Apple devices</b></p>
<p>Two common issues that lightning cable
users often encounter:</p>
<p>Issue One:</p>
<p>The standard lightning Power/Sync cable is
easily broken after using for a period of time. In other word, it is not durable.
Many Apple device users have to consider replacing a new lightning cable. It is
an annoying issue for most of Apple iPhone, iPod, iPad users.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441854241/dpcisbwta8fmmoo6waxh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Issue Two:</p>
<p>As you know, lightning plug is reversible
and you don’t need to worry about putting in the wrong direction. But for the
other USB end, you still need to pay attention to the right direction. So
standard lightning cable is not a fully reversible cable. You still need to
decide the right plug direction of USB port.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441854317/cd5egsifabc2ol8h6bpt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Can we get rid
of the above issues? The answer is YES.</p>
<p>Now, Zdat want to bring you a new cable
that settled the above two issues. Zdat ZT Cable is 300% durable compared with
standard lightning cables. And its USB plug is reversible.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441864093/zjkkbwg6kctvkgxbkrdo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It is a totally new lightning cable for
Apples devices. It is 300% more durable compared with standard lightning cable because it adopts super solid nylon braided skin.
The braid skin is called Dupont Teflon
<b>®</b> PTFE material. It is a braid skin of
polyester material and raise triple durability of cable compared with rubber
skin of standard lightning cable. We have experiments that the cable can be
twisted for more than 6000 times before it is broken. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441854926/qzyupvuqw9t8gyut4wtc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

</div></div>","Zdat –your 300% durable lightning cable
with fully reversible USB plug for your Apple devices
Two common issues that lightning cable
users often encounter:
Issue One:
The standard lightning Power/Sync cable is
easily broken after using for a period of time. In other word, it is not durable.
Many Apple device users have to consider replacing a new lightning cable. It is
an annoying issue for most of Apple iPhone, iPod, iPad users.
Issue Two:
As you know, lightning plug is reversible
and you don’t need to worry about putting in the wrong direction. But for the
other USB end, you still need to pay attention to the right direction. So
standard lightning cable is not a fully reversible cable. You still need to
decide the right plug direction of USB port.
Can we get rid
of the above issues? The answer is YES.
Now, Zdat want to bring you a new cable
that settled the above two issues. Zdat ZT Cable is 300% durable compared with
standard lightning cables. And its USB plug is reversible.
It is a totally new lightning cable for
Apples devices. It is 300% more durable compared with standard lightning cable because it adopts super solid nylon braided skin.
The braid skin is called Dupont Teflon
® PTFE material. It is a braid skin of
polyester material and raise triple durability of cable compared with rubber
skin of standard lightning cable. We have experiments that the cable can be
twisted for more than 6000 times before it is broken. 


Tension Test of 100 KG Picture:6000 times of Twistability Test:
The cable also has a rugged aluminum shell
for plug protection. As you can see from the pictures below: It is a MFi certified lightning cable and suitable for Apple devices. 

Fully reversible cable- both lightning and
USB plug can be reversible. It is not like normal lightning cable, which does
not have a reversible USB plug. It is more convenient than normal lightning
cable. To bring this cable to Apple devices owners in the world, we are aiming
to raise USD10000 for this project.

That makes them impractical for work, travel, or study on the go. With E-Pad, you can enjoy high-speed 4G data connectivity and stay connected anytime and anywhere. Your work, study, email or reading can continue as you move from home to school or office. Simply insert a SIM card and you’ve got data anywhere. E-Pad is fast, friendly and efficient.   Best Company For Writer | Support Bluetooth keyboard, earbuds, speakerIf you do any serious business or schoolwork on your phone or tablet, you know that typing on a screen can be a bit frustrating. E-Pad adds convenience and enhanced typing capabilities with support for Bluetooth keyboards. Connect seamlessly and type faster and more comfortably.   Android 7.0 | Allows you to download apps from Google play store  Using the E-Pad as a tablet is simple through the full support of Google's Play framework, including the Google Play store. This means that you can install virtually any Android application. Android system also offers better compatibility for third-party applications. You can download apps according to your personal needs and make E-Pad your personalized tablet!  Ten-Core Processor with 2GB RAM | Faster running speed Push the performance envelope with a powerful 10-core processor and 2 GB of random access memory to handle large documents and memory heavy apps. The speedy processor means that websites and programs load fast and smooth. Enjoy reading, writing, news and surfing with ease on the E-Pad. When documents get large and more storage is desired, you can easily add up to 32 GB of memory with TF card support. Download and store large books or collections without worry.   
  Speaker Enabled   Play video/music with the built-in speakers or connect wirelessly to any Bluetooth enabled earbuds/speaker.  More Than 20 Days of Standby Time  E-Pad is designed for active lifestyles and is made to go anywhere you go. A full battery charge will result in about 1 week of use or 4 weeks of standby time.   Dual Touch Control System   E-Pad has Dual Touch technology that helps you manage your E-Pad with ease and convenience. Use your finger with capacitive touch for quick notes or sketching or use the included Wacom stylus for writing, document mark-up or detailed drawing. The smooth action of the screen makes writing effortless no matter which method you prefer.   Stylus Pen with Eraser The advanced Wacom stylus makes writing simple and precise. Write, draw or sketch and if you make a mistake don’t worry, the stylus has an erasure feature built in that works just like a pencil eraser. Simply turn over the stylus and correct your work.",34.0,1,"1 Campaign

We have planned this launch to exhaustion, and we are confident that people are going to love using our mobile holder just as much as we do.

<p>Our estimated shipping date is early August 2019. You will automatically see the shipping rate per country once you make your pledge. Products will be shipped from the United States. Domestic transit will be 3-5 days with international transit time of 7-21 days depending on your location. Backers from other countries may see VAT or import charges depending on their local regulations, which is not built into the shipping costs. All tracking numbers will be sent within 24 hours of your order being sent.</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMS &amp; DUTIES INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country taxes.</p>
<p>Our terms of sale for international orders are FOB destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through indiegogo.</p>
<p>If you would like to estimate your duties, you can use this online tool (remember to convert the U.S. dollars to your local currency):</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/</a></p>
<p>For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs (including marking an order as a gift, which we cannot do). Once you make that payment to the customs broker your order will be processed for final delivery.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING POLICY</strong></p>
<p>It is critical that you enter your correct, valid address when placing your order. If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and you don't get it because you’re not there, wrong address or moved without notifying us, and the package returns back to our warehouse, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package.</p>

Our estimated shipping date is early August 2019. You will automatically see the shipping rate per country once you make your pledge. Products will be shipped from the United States. Domestic transit will be 3-5 days with international transit time of 7-21 days depending on your location. Backers from other countries may see VAT or import charges depending on their local regulations, which is not built into the shipping costs. All tracking numbers will be sent within 24 hours of your order being sent.
CUSTOMS & DUTIES INFORMATION
Our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country taxes.
Our terms of sale for international orders are FOB destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through indiegogo.
If you would like to estimate your duties, you can use this online tool (remember to convert the U.S. dollars to your local currency):
https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/
For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs (including marking an order as a gift, which we cannot do). Once you make that payment to the customs broker your order will be processed for final delivery.
SHIPPING POLICY
It is critical that you enter your correct, valid address when placing your order. If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and you don't get it because you’re not there, wrong address or moved without notifying us, and the package returns back to our warehouse, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In modern society, people are feeling disconnected, lonely, and misunderstood. Current dating applications are largely superficial in their matching which leads people to waste time on bad dates and bad relationships and losing hope in love altogether. As a result, TypeMatch seeks to revolutionize the realm of dating apps by matching individuals based on the 16 personality types of the MBTI in order to connect them with someone that fits with their personality like a yin and yang relationship.</p>
<p>In order to determine personality type and find a person’s perfect match, we have developed a unique test and algorithm. TypeMatch then matches individuals with complementary yet different personalities by showing the most compatible matches first, thus being a more efficient and effective way to use dating apps. Because people often struggle to describe themselves in their profiles, the app provides a list of descriptions by personality type that users can post on their profiles. Users with the same personality type can customize their descriptions by choosing the options that represent them best. This leaves other customizable fields to further express their individuality. Finally, TypeMatch provides many benefits to its gold users, one of which is dating and flirting advice that is specific to the personality type of the person they're interested in.</p>

<h3>Vote!</h3>
<p>Before we start the development of the app, we want to make sure there is enough interest in the market. Please place a yes vote for the app by donating $1 to show your interest.</p>
<h3>Help Fund!</h3>
<p>Funding for the product will go to the development of the application and marketing and advertising costs. Development is estimated to cost $20,000 and an additional $5000 is needed for initial marketing and advertising initiatives to get the app off the ground and generate as large of a user base as possible so that people have many potential matches. Even if the goals are not met, funds will be used for development costs. Not meeting goals will cause the application roll-out to be slower and smaller scale but we are dedicated to releasing it to the public</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>We recognize that individuals are complex and cannot be defined completely by a set of 16 personality types. However, personality type provides a frame and a system which can be used to understand our nature and the nature of others. Compatible personality types account for that natural spark and deep connection people feel with someone even though they’ve just met. TypeMatch’s goal is to make this feeling easier to find by creating a system whereby people can identify and match with people who complement them. For many people with rare personality types, it can be particularly difficult to find someone who understands them and clicks with them, and so TypeMatch wants to help. When two people have highly compatible personalities, they can feel like someone finally understands them and that they can be completely themselves. In a perfect match, each one’s weaknesses are the other’s strengths, and so they can count on each other to have each other’s backs. The two make each other stronger, help each other grow, and communicate more effortlessly. TypeMatch seeks to help people achieve this level of love and understanding. The ultimate goal of TypeMatch is to relieve some of the suffering of the world by matching people who can understand and connect with each other so that they can build strong and healthy relationships for the future.</p>

<p>The idea was conceived for the platform over ten years ago when I first began to work on my own as web developer. The idea behind the platform was to develop a system that would automate the day to day tasks required to run my business allowing me to focus on customer service and researching new techniques. Over the years the platform has had many different names and got to different stages. The stage I am at now is plugging all of those different features together into one platform. </p>
<p><b>HYBRID APPS: </b>Currently I have store, blog, photo gallery, projects gallery. video gallery and audio gallery systems ready. Some of these systems have basic VoiceAssisted functionality integrated into them but more work needs to be done to perfect both the systems themselves and the VoiceAssisted integration.</p>
<p><b>TOA:</b> Previously TOA was a natural linguistics program which could work out what people were saying to her and then calculate the closest answer to respond with. A few months ago I removed this feature as it needed a lot more work being done to it and replaced it with a new system that recognizes only certain phrases and executes the relevant command due to what has been said. I will soon be beginning to improve the original natural linguistics program and re integrating it with the exiting system which will create a more human like personal assistant that will understand more about general work related conversation and tasks. There is still a lot of integration and testing to be done with the existing TOA system, tuning up the usability of her features for visitors on Hybrid Apps and making her more efficient, quicker at responding and more recognition phrases. Another issue that needs to be addressed is that currently TOA has different voices depending on which browser you use and also the voice recognition features will only work in Google Chrome. These issues will be fixed by integrating more advanced recognition and voice synthesis software.</p>
<p><b>GUI:</b> The main section of the GUI where users will manage their account is pretty much complete. Users will be able to update their account details and manage their support tickets and billing via this section. Most of this part of the GUI is integrated with VoiceAssisted functions allowing easy navigation and helpful information about using the GUI on request. I am currently in process of updating existing Hybrid App control panels to work with the new platform and integrating VoiceAssisted functions into them. You can see an example of the above to features in the TOA In Action videos above. The next stage is to integrate the features from the last few years which will allow me to reproduce these systems very quickly as the process will be automated and carried out by TOA. Once this is in place I can begin to bring the prices down and be able to produce more systems per day.</p>
<p><b>COMMUNITY:</b> The foundations are in place for a community that is designed to bridge the gap between developers and the general public. Over the years I have come to realize that the gap between the general public and well known tech companies is pretty large and most people are not aware of security issues, new technology and innovation. The bridge between the general public and unknown developers that are striving to bring life changing technology to light is even greater and many developers are slowly drowning, this community plans to bring news, projects and products of both known companies and lone developers to help increase the chances of innovation growth and also to help educate the world with important information to ease the transition into the automated and connected era.</p>

</div></div>","Manage your content using voice commands, publishing it in real-time to the web, mobile devices and Facebook.













The VoiceAssisted Hybrid Apps are a range of web based applications that are accessible via the web, mobile devices, Facebook Apps and Facebook Tab Apps attached to your Facebook Business Page.



The VoiceAssisted technology not only allows you to upload your latest content using your voice whilst at home, in the office or on the move; but it also provides your visitors with assistance whilst browsing your application and using its features. 
VoiceAssisted Hybrid Apps provide a unique experience for visitors and users using the latest Speech Synthesis technology . Using the TechBubble GUI you can quickly personalize your Hybrid App, having it speak to visitors and guide them around the areas of the app.                                                                                                                                     














To businesses VoiceAssisted Hybrid Apps will allow their team to become more efficient, if you run a company blog, photo gallery, store and other online systems on your website, you will know that the time it takes to write down all of the information, spell check, upload and share is very consuming. Imagine a system where you could just speak to it and it would do all of the work for, that is one of the main features of VoiceAssisted Apps. Imagine you are a busy shop or takeaway and you have to constantly go to your computer, accept orders, read and write support messages, take payments as well as having to get the orders ready. VoiceAssisted Hybrid Apps take the admin away from you, notifying you of new orders by voice, helping you process the orders and sending notifications to your waiting clients on your command.




VoiceAssisted Hybrid Apps will help your users and visitors to the app by making it easy for them to navigate your application by providing the ability for them to simply speak to your app  and issue voice commands about what they are looking for or wish to do. Another primary aim of the VoiceAssisted features is to help people that have reading difficulties or people that are not used to using the internet by making your content more accessible. The sad truth is that although technology has advanced rapidly over the last few years, there is still many people that feel like they cannot use the internet due to lack of experience, I want the internet to be accessible by everyone, people of all ages should be able to benefit from the services found on the net, and this is one of the reasons that VoiceAssisted Apps were developed.




The core of the TechBubble platform is the TechBubble GUI, a centralized online operating system that has been designed to become the hub of all of your online activity, book keeping, staff management, budgeting and connected Internet of Things devices. The GUI is powered by TOA, the TechBubble Online Assistant,  who provides you with a personal assistant while managing your business. You can manually input data and content to the system or you can speak to TOA using her voice recognition functions and let her do all of the work for you.   As the GUI is a web based system and also Hybrid, it can be accessed on the web, mobile devices and even from within Facebook, meaning where you are and whatever you are doing you can manage your systems.                                                                                                                      








TOA is the TechBubble OnlineAssistant who acts as an online guide with the aim of making your life easier and your business more productive. TOA  has two 
levels of access and features:   
FRONT END FEATURES: On the front end she has the capability to offer navigational 
assistance, directing users around the various pages and systems of the 
Hybrid App; the ability to read blog articles, product details and photo
 descriptions; and to provide community notifications to TechBubble 
Community Users. 
BACK END FEATURES: On the back end in the TechBubble GUI TOA has the capability of internet 
related commands such as Google, Facebook and Twitter search, as well as

If my campaign is successful in reaching target the funds gained will allow me to pay server costs, purchase software required to enhance the features of the platform and Hybrid apps, purchase more advanced security helping to ensure the platform and apps stay secure, purchase a Mac to allow me to create the iOS version of the platform and integrated apps, purchase the software and hardware that is required to get the IoT products to beta stages, pay for marketing, and allow me to support myself and the expenses of developing and running the platform.  This will allow me to dedicate all of my time to completing, testing and expanding the platform and all of the related products. If I receive funding similar to the amounts I have seen on the Indiegogo platform, then I will be looking for an office and taking the steps to create the company that I envisioned over ten years ago. My dream is to build a more connected and secure world, the only reason I am working on my own is that I have never had the funds to expand. My ultimate goal is to create a company that provides the best tech at affordable prices meaning everyone will be able to afford it. I want to create jobs and build an advanced team that covers all aspects of technology from social media and web development, to home automation and robotics.

The task was to design a smartphone app, build a website, create a 90-second promo video and a working smoke detector to trigger the app to sound the alarm - all within 54 hours.

Our StoryWhen entrepreneur Alan Clare learned about young people travelling losing their life staying a in accommodation without fire safety he set out to create a portable, pocket-sized optical smoke detector that was lightweight, small and unsurpassed in terms of quality. And he did.
This triumphant creation prompted Alan to take it further and what followed was the design and creation of the wristband, a luggage and room door alarm, and the USB motion-sensor camera all linked to smartphone app to make a one-stop personal safety and security travel pack - so small it can slip into your carry-on luggage.
Travel Safe App - the world’s first personal miniature travel safety and security system was born.

Award-winning
innovationDid you know, Travel Safe App won second prize at the prestigious
Global Startup Battle on the Gold Coast in November 2014?

ChallengesWe
have created something that has never been done before – a safety and security
system made specifically for travellers. Like all innovations, we understand
there could be some delays beyond our control, but we ensure full transparency
should this occur and will endeavor to have your order delivered as quickly as
possible. As we advance our design and manufacturing, some specifications may
vary slightly from our tested preproduction prototypes, however style and
functionality will not be compromised.  
From humble beginnings…Our product has been a labour of love and like all good inventions, it's evolved during its short lifetime. At the Global Startup Challenge in South-East Queensland, creator Alan Clare submitted a patent application to protect the idea covering a range of smartphone links to fire and safety devices. The task was to design a smartphone app, build a website, create a 90-second promo video and a working smoke detector to trigger the app to sound the alarm - all within 54 hours. The prototype was awarded second place in the Entrepreneur Tract Award.
The progression of the prototype:

   

How you can support usIf
you, your family or your friends love travelling – or if you simply love what
we’re about and you place a priority on safety – support us by spreading the
word and purchasing the Travel Safe App pack. We want to make the world a safer
place for everyone to explore, and we want to help save lives in the process.
Want more tech info?
We've put a lot of time and research into our products to ensure we have utilised the best technology.
Comparative sound readings for Panic Button App alarm Vs Travel Safe App alarm.The professional sound readings confirm that smart phone apps are not capable of providing the ""Startle Effect"" to be a real deterrent from any  potential attacker from behind while walking down the street. 
The instant response of the TSA system of 100 Db when compared with an app is self evident from the graph and considerable delay of accessing a smart phone app at a much lower sound output  makes smart phone apps obeslete.


Travel Safe App Siren is 100 dB - 16 times louder than a standard smartphone alarm!

Findings: The professional sound readings confirm that smart phone apps are not capable of providing the ""Startle Effect"" to be a real deterrent from any  potential attacker from behind while walking down the street. Most at risk are slight build women or man who could be easily over powered. 
The instant response of the TSA system of 100 Db when compared with app is self evident from the graph and considerable delay of accessing a smart phone app at a lower sound output.

Your Global Calling Help Network





When you purchase your TSA System you are able to input phone numbers of your support group list of those you wish to be of assistance to you in a trigger event any where in the world. This will  be just a local call.
This will also direct you to information where appropriate regarding the type emergency and directory of globle  emergency listings.


System Running Costs
You may need to charge up the batteries every 3 - 4 weeks when travelling.


 It is expected that the Siren Box rechargeable batteries will likely last as long as the  the smoke detector which has a warranted for 5 years, but expected to last 10 years.
Therefore the cost over ten years would be less $20.00 per year, an insignificant cost.


Travel Safe Testimonials.
SHANE: Shane went to a friend's 40th birthday party and after the event a few of his mates went to a cafe across the road where they had coffee. Shane left to go home but as he walked out  the front of  the cafe, a group of seven guys badly bashed him, broke his jaw and he was rushed to hospital. 
He was  was put into a induced coma on a ventilator with multiple injuries for a week. He was in hospital for several weeks and missed two months of work, as he has his own business it was both financially crippling and physically painful. 
Shane is a tall, fit man with a solid build but was easily downed and left helpless in the street. Shane was rescued by one of this mates who heard the noise, came out of the cafe and the called an ambulance.
Shane has already ordered our Travel Safe App pack and is on the early list to make him more safe and secure. This assault has been fully documented by police and hospital records.
DAVID: David from New York spoke about his sister and brother-inlaw’s experience while travelling in France and staying at a five-star hotel in Paris.
David’s sister woke during the night hearing her husband wandering around in the room but took no notice and drifted off to sleep again. When she awoke, she realised they'd been robbed and in fact it was a burglar in the night, who'd stolen their wallets passports, laptops and jewellery.
She was so shocked that it happened to them, and she now wants to have a TSA system as soon as it is released for future overseas travel.
Details of this event are available to verify the room invasion experienced by David's sister during the night while staying in Paris.

<p>Fire. Fire offers a line of
custom fire pits and accessories to help make any outdoor event special and
unique. We offer colored flames, burning sculptures, large fire pits for focal
points, and small fire pits for boundary and area lighting. We create custom
fire pits and accent lighting to enhance the decor of mood of the event.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create the very
best, completely custom fire pits to ensure our clients have a unique,
memorable event.  We are seeking funding so we can have our fabricator do
what he does best: create incredible metal fire pits in his laboratory that
excel in both form and function.  Our pit design features a two-part
construction with a wide, shallow bowl to allow for the maximum viewing
vantage.  Clients can customize the pits for their events by requesting
personalized etching and engraving.  We plan to offer our base, “Fire. Fire,”
pits for our standard inventory and offer the custom pits on demand. We
also created our proprietary “Fire Vases” which are three foot, vertical fire
pits designed to burn logs and long branches vertically for accent and boarder
lighting.</p>

<p><strong>Why Clean Fuel Screen Filter?</strong></p>
<p>Because the fuel injector or the throttle body are not fuel pumps they must depend on the pressure (psi) of the fuel pump in  the tank, if the fuel pump filter on the bottom of the pump becomes restricted due to debris or other particulates the pressure is not correct and it creates a condition called lean burn, meaning that there is too much air and not enough fuel. </p>
<p>This condition is not as powerful and is very very hot, creating a very hot exhaust. and loss of power. Over time this hot condition burns up the o2 sensor and melts the inner meshing components of the catalytic converter, it also causes the pump to burn itself up <br/>The cleaner the fuel the better the performance of the vehicle will be.</p>
<p>THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND AND A TOTAL SOLUTION TO THE DIRTY FUEL PROBLEM. </p>
<p>The <strong>Clean Fuel Screen Filter</strong> was invented by Ernie Washington, an aviation &amp; automotive mechanic of 60+ years. This product was invented while contracting in the Middle East. </p>
<p>While servicing a large fleet of vehicles in support of the military, we noticed a gross amount of unserviceable vehicles due to failure of major components in the fuel delivery system. This was caused by particulates, debris, &amp; sediment being introduced into the tank during refueling. </p>
<p>Although we already have at least 2 filters in most vehicles systems, they are all post filters, meaning that they are attempting to filter the fuel after it has already entered the tank. </p>
<p>This got us thinking..Not only is this a major issue in the Middle East, but during my 50 years of owning my own repair facilities across the U.S., I have encountered this same ""dirty fuel"" problem over &amp; over again.  I knew that something needed to be developed that would eliminate this problem for good. That's when I came up with the idea of filtering the fuel before it enters the tank. </p>
<p>The <strong>Clean Fuel Screen Filter</strong> is a revolutionary product that does just that. </p>
<p><strong>No auto mechanic needed. </strong></p>
<p>It's low price, &amp; simple installation or removal makes it accessible to almost anyone. Once it is installed, it aids in prolonging the life of the fuel pump, the fuel filter, the fuel pressure regulator, the fuel injectors and more. Which, in turn, will leave your wallet thanking you.</p>

<p>We would like to reach our initial goal of $10,000.  </p>
<p>We have single, couple &amp; family packs available in our perks section. Each perk except the single pack is priced at a discount.</p>
<p>We've tested the Clean Fuel Screen Filter to fit many vehicles, but we'd like to expand our testing to include as many vehicles as possible.  You can support the project by letting us know if the Clean Fuel Screen Filter does not fit your vehicle.  If you find that the Clean Fuel Screen Filter does not fit your vehicle, visit<a href=""http://www.cleanfuelscreen.com/compatibility"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> www.cleanfuelscreen.com/compatibility</a> and add your vehicle year, make , and model to our list to help us expand the project so everyone can benefit from having a vehicle that functions at peak performance and a prolonged life.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our initial goal, all orders that have been placed will be fulfilled and we will continue sales via our official website as well as other internet outlets.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This product is one of the most needed parts in the fuel delivery system. It really allows the vehicle to function at it's peak performance. At present, we are fighting the detrimental results of fuel filtering that begins at the vehicles fuel pump filter. We set out to change this by introducing our product (<strong>Clean Fuel Screen Filter</strong>) which filters the fuel at the fuel pump nozzles end - before it enters the tank. </p>
<p>With extensive internal testing and use of our original prototype, upon application of our product, we found that debris, particulates and sediment were trapped, preventing it from entering the tank in the first place. The problems we encountered on the test vehicles prior to installing the <strong>Clean Fuel Screen Filter</strong> were no longer occurring. With these successful results we were employed to install this product on all the vehicles in our fleet which was our first major purchase order of $137,000.00. </p>

<p>Hi we came across this idea because of the need to have access to the lightning port thru more than one way simultaneusly, so the idea is quite simple, we design the smallest nd durable lightning adapter ever, in that way that you and everybody else can use earpods while charging. The idea came pretty much from the need to be in a college library and hear thru headphones podcasts but the battery life goes out quickly, so with that adapter you can plug your powerbank or just plug it to the wall and enjoy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We see some projekts on the market but they are so complicated cheap made and bad designed that they make their cause harder, they plug cords and adapters and more cords is endless unusability.so we rty to create an efficient product that be there for you when ever you need it small, light and durable, selected perks give you access to early birds, beta versions and discount codes. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>So far the risk is to fit the all new for these needs dual layer closed circuit into that small area inside the adapter, there for we working with some engineers they can help, but we need your support because of pre-production costs and construction factory payments</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

There were almost 1.2 million violent crimes committed in the United States in 2014. 
We at TaylorMade Security believe that it is time for each and every one of us to stand up for one another. It is time that we, as a people, stand up against violent crime against our fellow human. It is up to us to protect those that cannot protect themselves, to give a voice to those who remain voiceless and to help those who would otherwise be helpless. Itus will enable us to unite together against these senseless and violent crimes and hear the cries that would otherwise be unheard.






Where does the funding go?
Contributions for this project goes towards the development and the launch of this amazing life saving app. Your contributions will save lives in the very near future. We will use this funding to complete the final phases of Itus. The remaining contributions will be to market and distribute as well as ensure the network of Itus Guardian users are the most qualified individuals.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<b>Sylky</b> is a new app that helps connect tradies and customers for all types and <span style=""background-color: initial;"">sizes of jobs. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p></p>
<div>Sylky was created by Sylvain Hollinger and Matt Morgan, two guys from Sydney’s northern beaches who, after working as tradespeople for more than a    decade, understood better than most that the industry needed to change. <p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>For many years, the industry had relied on outdated ways of getting new business with many tradies not understanding the concerns of their customers. Sylvain and Matt wanted to design a better way for tradies to be able to work as much and when they wanted, while at the same time improving the way consumer’s hired and worked with tradies. <p></p>
<p>So, with this unique perspective and a strong desire to change the way people feel about hiring tradies, Sylvain and Matt have created Sylky, a reliable, transparent and easy to use way to take care of any job from a small plumping emergency in your home or a electrical problem at work, to a full renovation of your home. </p>

Development of Virtual Client Services – Citizens Bank Account 6+ yearsWe are a combination of Virtual and Desktop engineers with backgrounds in Citrix, Project Management, hardware/software support, and Service Delivery Management. Risks & ChallengesRisks and challenges are a natural part of any adventure, and it takes an experienced adventurer to be able to surmount them.  All current members have, at one time or another owned and operated their own business.  Also, working in the technical service industry, we all understand the customer comes first and at the end of the day “It Must Work”.  A combination of working with the public as well as overcoming various technical, creative, and personal challenges makes us the ideal team to work through any issue. ChallengesManufacturing: Cost and logistics of manufacturing can be daunting.  We have hands on experience and a modular design for our equipment, which will help drive down costs. Usability of Equipment: As we go through development and testing, the usability of our equipment as well as the program will be a top priority.  We will overcome this challenge by vigorous testing by our developers and everyday users.  We will be paying attention to user feedback and ensuring the equipment and UI is fun and easy to use, even for the most novice of players. User Feedback Analysis: Feedback from our valued customers is what will keep the product fresh, efficient, and desirable.  Analyzing constructive feedback will be instrumental to adapting our project for the better. Lower amount of Data Charge(s): It will be a focus to keep data costs low for users who have data plans.  Keeping code simple using web sockets will help to address this issue. Risks:  Marketing Strategies: Since this is a new type of game that is not widely available, marketing strategy will also be new and untested.  Our current plan is to follow the popularity of similar games that utilize augmented reality and target those customers.Additional Equipment Purchase needed for play:  Since there is no base-play model, users will need to spend additional money on the equipment.  We will keep additional costs low by offering various models of additional equipment. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can’t contribute, please get the word out!  We believe this product will fill a void in the fascinating world of Augmented Reality!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Currently all of the components I have used are commercially available in the market. The development of a custom designed PCB is under progress and should be ready soon. After completion of the work of PCB designing it will  be directly tested on the MDK which will be the last stage of the prototyping. I need your help to take this prototype to Motorola and work with them to develop and test the final product ,as well as, get required certification and finalize the electronics.</p>

you want to see what is hidden under the water surface area, you can either

and well equipped with a camera you can explore the hidden and mysterious
underwater world of seas and oceans on your own.</span><i>Diving robots <i>internationally </i>are known as ROV - (<b>R</b>emotely <b>O</b>perated <b>V</b>ehicle).</i><br/><br/>
<b>ROV-Control</b> is the first modular control-system worldwide for homebuilt diving robots.<b><br/>
</b><br/>Theoretically
there are no limits for size or shape if you want to construct a diving robot.<br/><p>That is the reason why <b>ROV-Control
</b><span>was invented as a modular system
especially for homebuilt diving robots. You can use it for small diving robots
as well as for complex diving systems. </span><br/></p><br/><h2>
<b>How can you control it?</b><br/>
</h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129681/files/20150103172127-controlview4.jpg?1420334487"" src="""" style=""width: 616.953px; height: 405px;""/><br/>All you need is a laptop (with the <b>ROV-Control</b>
software) and a joystick or a gamepad. Every movement is sent by the software
via USB data-transmitter to the diving robot to control the engines. With <b>ROV-Control </b>you can manage the lights
and other appliances. Furthermore you can display sensor data
like temperature and depth.<br/><br/><br/><h2>X³-Control</h2>
<p>The
X³-Control is the mainboard of the <b>ROV-Control
</b>solution. It is the centerpiece of the <b>ROV. </b>There are two different models:<br/></p><p style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1125897/files/20150101115108-x3free.jpg?1420141868"" src="""" style=""""/>*<i>with vertical pinheaders</i><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135477/files/20150106181547-x3angledfree.jpg?1420596947"" src="""" style=""""/>*<i>with angled pinheaders</i></p>
<p>The

<h2>The camera<br/>
</h2>The most important part is the camera of course. It works as the „eye“ of the ROV. You can use every camera with a video output (yellow cinch/RCA). Cameras are not very expensive but to receive a good recording quality it is highly recommended to use a GoPro Hero HD (1,2,3) camera.<br/>GoPro cameras have a high recording quality and a wide angle of up to 170 degrees. That`s why these cameras are predestinated for the usage in diving robots.<br/><br/>The <b>CAM-CONTROL</b> is a module in the same format as the X³-Control. With this module and the ROV-Control software it is possible to control two GoPro Hero HD (1,2,3) cameras at the same time.<br/>The CAM-CONTROL is connected to the X³-Control and offers the following functions:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Controlling of MODE, SHUTTER* and WIFI*-button</li>
<li>Switchable power supply – no battery for camera is needed</li>
<li>Live-Out video at the GoPro Hero Bus </li>

<h2>The video<br/>
</h2>
<p>The
video signal is transmitted separately from the data. For each video signal
you need two wires.</p>
<p>For
the transmitting to the ROV a common network cable is recommended. It has eight
wires, so you can use four wires for the data and the other four wires to
transmit two different video signals to surface at the same time.<br/></p>

The USB-DATA-VIDEO offers a
network socket to connect the X³-Control in a simple way by a network cable (up to 1000m/3000ft
length) to a laptop.<p></p>

<h2>Sensors</h2>
<p>
</p><p>The
following sensors can be connected to the X³-Control via I2C.</p>
<h3>Compass<br/>
</h3>With the sensor for the compass you can determine the direction of the
diving robot. <br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135908/files/20150107024303-9dof.jpg?1420627383"" src="""" style=""width: 263.35px; height: 227px;""/><br/></p>
<p>In
case of an error an optional second compass sensor will be used for the auto-surface function of the Errorpilot.<br/></p><h3>Pitch and Roll</h3>
<p>A gyro sensor for the position provides the
values for roll and pitch. This
sensor is also placed on the compass module.</p>
<h3>Temperatur<br/>
</h3>
<p>It
is possible to connect up to eight temperature sensors via I2C.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129453/files/20150103143530-tempsensors.jpg?1420324530"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Depth<br/>
</h3>
<p>Pressure
sensors with 4-20mA or 0-5V output can be directly connected to the X³-Control.
There are also two digital pressure sensors (I2C) for 60 m and 140 m depth
available.<br/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1136633/files/20150107105516-ms5803.jpg?1420656916"" src="""" style=""width: 268.264px; height: 201px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1137663/files/20150108000856-pressuresensor1.jpg?1420704536"" src="""" style=""width: 311.297px; height: 240px;""/>
<br/><h3>Humidity<br/>
</h3>
<p>With
the humidity sensor it is possible to measure humidity and temperature. </p>
<br/><h2>Modules</h2>
<p>
</p><p>The
following modules can be connected to X³-Control via I2C.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>LED-BOARD</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135925/files/20150107031157-ledboard.jpg?1420629117"" src="""" style=""width: 293.063px; height: 189px;""/></h3>
<p>The
LED-BOARD displays the current status of the X³-Control and the
connected modules with eight colored LEDs. It can be put for example visible
from the outside behind the front window of the ROV.</p>
<br/><h3>LIPO-CELL-MONITOR</h3>
<p>Lithium-polymer batteries are very common for homemade robots. They are also
suitable for usage in a ROV.</p>
For the supply of the
X³-Control a Lipo-battery-pack with four cells (14,8 V) is
recommended. The cells can be damaged in case of undervoltage. That`s why they
have to be monitored all the time. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1161223/files/20150119222232-lipomonitor.jpg?1421734952"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The LIPO-CELL-MONITOR monitors the voltage of each cell. The software sends an alarm in case of the
voltage is falling below a configured minimum. The module is directly connected to the
balancer-connector of the LiPo battery. The LIPO-CELL-MONITOR is on the CAM-CONTROL
as well and is connected to the X³-Control via I2C.</p>
<br/><h3>SENSOR-BOARD</h3>
<p>
</p><p>Current or leakage sensors are connected
to a SENSOR-BOARD. For an easy installation it is possible to place the plug
connections in different directions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1137665/files/20150108001550-sensorboards.jpg?1420704950"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Each SENSOR-BOARD has four channels for current or leakage sensors. A
status-LED displays the electrical power supply. It is connected to the
X³-Control via I2C.<br/><b>Eight
different adresses provide 32 sensor channels.</b><br/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135825/files/20150107010923-sensortree.jpg?1420621763"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/>
<h3>I2C-HUB</h3>
<p>The I2C-HUB offers seven I2C ports. An optional voltage converter supplies the moduls and sensors which are
connected.<br/></p><p></p>

<br/><h3>CONSTANT-CURRENT-SOURCES<br/>
</h3>
<p>For
the usage of high-power-LEDs on the LED-channels of the X³-Control you will
need a constant-current-source. It supplies the connected LEDs with permanent
current.</p>
<p>For
the X³-Control there are three different modules:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1126581/files/20150101201901-ksqs.jpg?1420172341"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>The <b>KSQ1000</b> can handle LEDs with 1000mA on one channel of the  X³-Control.</li>
<li>The <b>KSQ700-D</b> can handle LEDs with 700mA on two channels.</li>
<li>The <b>KSQ1000-Q</b> can handle LEDs with 1000 mA on all the four channels of the  X³-Control.
<br/><br/>
</li>
</ol><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1137704/files/20150108011330-ksqwled.bmp?1420708410"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">* 3x Cree XM-L T6 at KSQ1000<br/></p>Depending
on the supply voltage it is possible to run multiple LEDs on a
constant-current-source at the same time.

<br/><br/><br/><h2>Modules (prototypes)<br/>
</h2>
<p>These
modules are still in a development. They will be available in May 2015:<br/></p><h3>MAIN-SWITCH (75A)<br/>
</h3>
<p>The MAIN-SWITCH turns on and off the main power circuit by using the X³-Control. It
has a maximum continuous rate of 75 ampere.</p>
<h3>POWER-SWITCH (8-CH)<br/>
</h3>
<p>For high-performance loads (for example ESC and thruster) – the POWER-SWITCH is the best solution. Eight channels can handle consumers up to 30
ampere. <b>Four addresses supplies overall
32 switching channels.<br/></b></p>

<br/>FAQ:</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Why is a cable used?</h3>
<p>A wireless communication is not possible under water. <span>Water absorbs high frequencies very strong. To transmit a video signal frequencies are needed in the gigahertz range. Even the model building submarines can dive controlled by only a few feet - without video transmission.</span></p><p></p><h3>How to use motors in the water?</h3>Brushless-motors can be used in water without any changes. If you want to run it in saltwater, painting the coils will be necessary.<br/><br/>
<h3>Why is there no all-in-one solution?</h3>
<p>When
you use diving robots it is not really practical to place all sensors on the
main case because the sensor information can or shall not be recorded there. A
pressure sensor on the control unit would not be very wise because it has
to be placed in a pressure-tight case. <span>Depending on the size and configuration of the system are parts housed in other cases.</span> A modular system offers a free
configuration and construction of all cases and modules at low cabling work.<br/></p><h3>Why no Ethernet is used for transmission of video and data?<br/>
</h3>An Ethernet limits the use of the camera systems only on webcams. But most cameras (like GoPro) have a “video-out” (yellow cinch/RCA). This signal cannot be send with data. However this video signal can be send by a cheap video-balun up to 300m(900ft) and with a second video signal by a common network-cable.<br/><br/><h3>Why no embedded solution (Raspberry Pi) is used?</h3>To wire the controller easily understandable provides the X³ control in a small space exactly those functions that are needed. An intricate lead out or tapping the pins is not necessary.<br/>For diving robots the power consumption of components is very important. It decides during the battery operation on the period of use. An embedded system uses and provides the components with energy all the time, which have been assembled. A specially developed control unit does not require the hardware used in embedded systems, yet these (processor) power.<br/><br/><h3>
<span>Is there a gripper arm solution</span>?</h3>
<p>A gripper arm
is an extensive, mechanical and technical challenge. There is still no
available grappler solution, which could be integrated.<br/></p><h3>W<span>hy is there no complete kit</span>?</h3><h3></h3>
<p>Constructing homemade diving robots is a growing trend. But there are rarely finished components. The crowdfunding of an american team has recently proved the substantial demand for thruster units, the T100 Thruster, which have been specially produced for the drive of watercrafts. <span>Of course the X³ Control is compatible with the T100 and T200 thrusters.</span></p>

<p></p>When I started self-construction of diving robots 7 years ago, there were only less people who tried it. The most people (like me) did not miss the creative ideas for the diving robots-drafts, but an easy to handle control solution. You were reliant on the most primitive media to realise the controlling, without any programmer skills and knowledge about microcontroller.<br/>I do not offer a complete kit, because the liberty of the modular ROV-Control system shall encourage to new diving robots concepts and thruster configurations.<br/>But I am sure there will be a larger charge of components and elements in the current age of the 3D-printers.<p></p><p></p><h3>Where can i get help?</h3><span>During the crowdfunding website <a href=""http://www.rov-control.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rov-control.com</a> is offline for updates.<br/><br/> There you will  soon find more information about the construction of ROVs, a webshop with all modules and lots of accessories, as well as an English and a German-speaking forum.

<p></p>ROV-Control has given the proof in several diving robots that it works successful. From the beginning the upgrading to the full range of the module was well planned. The further development of the software was promoted in a professional way. Many of the modules are either already implemented in ROVER3D and in use or the prototypes still tested.<br/><br/>If new sources of error would be found the process of manufacture could be delayed and costs could increase. I know these kinds of “last-minute problems” very well and that`s the reason why I have calculated some buffers.<br/><br/>For the crowdfunding goals above 35.000 € it is not yet possible to determine the point of the start of the production run.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who stands behind ROV-Control?</h3>
<p></p>I am a 30 years old, well skilled IT systems technician and for more than seven years I am dealing with the construction of diving robots. I have developed a complete new design for diving robots and the first tests with ROVER II were very successful.<br/>At the time when I started the construction there was no control solution at all. For that reason I tried from the beginning to develop an easy to use control system with a flexible structure and an extensive software to realize individual diving robots.<br/><br/>For a long time I was working on my own. In the meantime I work together with a very competent software engineer and expert for electronic issues. They are not named because they are not a part of this project.<br/><br/>Both of my diving robots are 100% hand-made. I have neither used a turning machine or a CNC-milling-machine. I have just jused tools which you can find in every domestic home. Everybody can copy it....you only have to find the way to your local tool store.<br/>I really try to answer all the questions concerning the details.<br/>The new ROV-CONTROL website will be online soon with multi-language forum and more support and instruction manuals.<br/><p></p><p>Andreas Knabbe</p></div>","If
you want to see what is hidden under the water surface area, you can either
submerge… or you can construct a diving robot. Motorized
and well equipped with a camera you can explore the hidden and mysterious
underwater world of seas and oceans on your own.Diving robots internationally are known as ROV - (Remotely Operated Vehicle).
ROV-Control is the first modular control-system worldwide for homebuilt diving robots.
Theoretically
there are no limits for size or shape if you want to construct a diving robot.That is the reason why ROV-Control
was invented as a modular system
especially for homebuilt diving robots. You can use it for small diving robots
as well as for complex diving systems. 
How can you control it?
All you need is a laptop (with the ROV-Control
software) and a joystick or a gamepad. Every movement is sent by the software
via USB data-transmitter to the diving robot to control the engines. With ROV-Control you can manage the lights
and other appliances. Furthermore you can display sensor data
like temperature and depth.X³-Control
The
X³-Control is the mainboard of the ROV-Control
solution. It is the centerpiece of the ROV. There are two different models:*with vertical pinheaders*with angled pinheaders
The
mainboard is part of the diving robot. It is responsible for the steering of
the motors and modules of the system. Two microcontrollers ensure a fast response
to the control commands of the pilot and a high operating reliability.Features of the X³-Control



It
is possible to connect up to eight Electronic-Speed-Controller (ESC) to the
X³-Control and trigger up to eight
brushless-engines separatly.*X³-Control with ESC and Brushless-Motor
Features:

Four LED-PWM channels for high-power-LEDs can be dimmed separately. A
     flashlight function makes it possible to use one channel as a position
     flashlight.
Four
     2-way-switching-relays are implemented to connect different appliances.
     Each of them can handle consumers up to 1 Ah.
For
     measuring the depth it is possible to install different pressure sensors.
The
     GPS-sensor facilitates the marking and relocation of interesting diving
     areas.
In case
     of a cable break a bluetooth module supports a wireless-connection on surface (after auto-surface) and to navigate the
     diving robot controlled ashore.
The
     electrical power supply of the X³-Control works with two magnetic
     contacts. They are placed inside of the pressure hull and enable to switch the power of the X-Control contact-free with a magnet. 
The
     X³-Control is made for lithium-polymer rechargeable batteries up to four
     cells. It runs with a supply voltage between 6,5 and 18 VDC. It is
     equipped with a reverse polarity and overload protection.
The
     temperature of both controllers is monitored by a digital sensor.

The automatic hardware-detection eases the configuration of additional modules and sensors. The X³-Control detects them automatically and displays them in the setup of the ROV-Control Software. 

Status-LEDs
     for power and controller 1 and 2.
Firmware
     updates can be transferred automatically by a data interface.
The
     four-terminal Full Duplex-RS485 interface guarantees high transfer rates
     for cable lenghts up to 1000m (3000ft).

(Please read FAQ at bottom why wireless-connection is not possible) 
Modules, sensors and extensions are connected to the X³-Control via one
of the six I2C-ports.Modules for the X³-Control


The
following extensions can be connected to the X³-Control:


The camera
The most important part is the camera of course. It works as the „eye“ of the ROV. You can use every camera with a video output (yellow cinch/RCA). Cameras are not very expensive but to receive a good recording quality it is highly recommended to use a GoPro Hero HD (1,2,3) camera.GoPro cameras have a high recording quality and a wide angle of up to 170 degrees. That`s why these cameras are predestinated for the usage in diving robots.The CAM-CONTROL is a module in the same format as the X³-Control. With this module and the ROV-Control software it is possible to control two GoPro Hero HD (1,2,3) cameras at the same time.The CAM-CONTROL is connected to the X³-Control and offers the following functions:
Controlling of MODE, SHUTTER* and WIFI*-button
Switchable power supply – no battery for camera is needed
Live-Out video at the GoPro Hero Bus 




LIPO-CELL-MONITOR for the monitoring of four battery cell voltages.
Active powered I2C-HUB for other six I2C-modules
Eight channels for current or leakage sensors

Control-LED for POWER (I2C), CAM 1 and CAM 2*requires soldering



The video

The
video signal is transmitted separately from the data. For each video signal
you need two wires.
For
the transmitting to the ROV a common network cable is recommended. It has eight
wires, so you can use four wires for the data and the other four wires to
transmit two different video signals to surface at the same time.

The USB-DATA-VIDEO offers a
network socket to connect the X³-Control in a simple way by a network cable (up to 1000m/3000ft
length) to a laptop.
The data interface is connected via USB and the video channels are conneted via two (Cinch) RCA sockets.To display the video signal on the surface you can either use a monitor with a video input or it can be displayed via an USB-videograbber on the laptop screen.
The software


The new version of the ROV-Control software appears in a new design. It offers a wide range setup and a lot of new features.Axes Mixer V2
In the innovative axes mixer V2 the motors are assigned to the control axes of the joystick or gamepad. There is a separate mixer setup for each control axis.The direction of rotation and the power of the thruster can be configurated separately for each motor channel.Because of the tuneable adjustment of the axes it is quite simple to put the diving robot in balance.

Sensors - 2nd compass
For a higher reliability operation it is possible to connect a second compass sensor to the second microcontroller. In case of the main compass fails it is still possible to navigate the diving robot safely ashore.

 The Lipo-Cell-Monitor assists with monitoring all of the cell voltages. The Lipo-Cell-Monitor is placed on the CAM-CONTROL and available as a stand-alone module.

Autopilot
To simplify the control the software is able to trim the diving robot in balance and to keep depth, course and position automatically. For this the individually configurable control axes are used.

Error-Mode
Cable broken? No problem at all!If the connection to the diving robot fails it will surfaces self-dependent after the adjusted time has past.  From the surface it is possible to get a data connection via bluetooth which enables to navigate the diving robot back to the shore.  The X³-Control can also handle itself in a certain direction to go ashore automatically.In the future the ROV will be able to reach GPS-positions itself

Overlay-Skin


With the Overlay-Skin data from the sensors and control functions can be displayed directly on the video stream. For this the video signal will be converted via USB-videograbber to the laptop and can be streamed on the software-background.
Touchscreen-Skin


In case of the video signal will be directly displayed on a monitor or a television screen (instead of displayed via videograbber on the laptop) it is recommended to use the Touchscreen-Skin. It is well optimized for touchscreen laptop or on an external touchscreen-monitor.

Sensors

The
following sensors can be connected to the X³-Control via I2C.
Compass
With the sensor for the compass you can determine the direction of the
diving robot. 

In
case of an error an optional second compass sensor will be used for the auto-surface function of the Errorpilot.Pitch and Roll
A gyro sensor for the position provides the
values for roll and pitch. This
sensor is also placed on the compass module.
Temperatur

It
is possible to connect up to eight temperature sensors via I2C.

Depth

Pressure
sensors with 4-20mA or 0-5V output can be directly connected to the X³-Control.
There are also two digital pressure sensors (I2C) for 60 m and 140 m depth
available.
Humidity

With
the humidity sensor it is possible to measure humidity and temperature. 
Modules

The
following modules can be connected to X³-Control via I2C.

LED-BOARD

The
LED-BOARD displays the current status of the X³-Control and the
connected modules with eight colored LEDs. It can be put for example visible
from the outside behind the front window of the ROV.
LIPO-CELL-MONITOR
Lithium-polymer batteries are very common for homemade robots. They are also
suitable for usage in a ROV.
For the supply of the
X³-Control a Lipo-battery-pack with four cells (14,8 V) is
recommended. The cells can be damaged in case of undervoltage. That`s why they
have to be monitored all the time. 
The LIPO-CELL-MONITOR monitors the voltage of each cell. The software sends an alarm in case of the
voltage is falling below a configured minimum. The module is directly connected to the
balancer-connector of the LiPo battery. The LIPO-CELL-MONITOR is on the CAM-CONTROL
as well and is connected to the X³-Control via I2C.
SENSOR-BOARD

Current or leakage sensors are connected
to a SENSOR-BOARD. For an easy installation it is possible to place the plug
connections in different directions.


Each SENSOR-BOARD has four channels for current or leakage sensors. A
status-LED displays the electrical power supply. It is connected to the
X³-Control via I2C.Eight
different adresses provide 32 sensor channels.
I2C-HUB
The I2C-HUB offers seven I2C ports. An optional voltage converter supplies the moduls and sensors which are
connected.


VIDEO-SWITCH
The
4-channel VIDEO-SWITCH enables switching four camera signals on two outputs. It
is also possible to use it in one-channel-mode



CONSTANT-CURRENT-SOURCES

For
the usage of high-power-LEDs on the LED-channels of the X³-Control you will
need a constant-current-source. It supplies the connected LEDs with permanent
current.
For
the X³-Control there are three different modules:


The KSQ1000 can handle LEDs with 1000mA on one channel of the  X³-Control.
The KSQ700-D can handle LEDs with 700mA on two channels.
The KSQ1000-Q can handle LEDs with 1000 mA on all the four channels of the  X³-Control.



* 3x Cree XM-L T6 at KSQ1000Depending
on the supply voltage it is possible to run multiple LEDs on a
constant-current-source at the same time.

Modules (prototypes)

These
modules are still in a development. They will be available in May 2015:MAIN-SWITCH (75A)

The MAIN-SWITCH turns on and off the main power circuit by using the X³-Control. It
has a maximum continuous rate of 75 ampere.
POWER-SWITCH (8-CH)

For high-performance loads (for example ESC and thruster) – the POWER-SWITCH is the best solution. Eight channels can handle consumers up to 30
ampere. Four addresses supplies overall
32 switching channels.
CAM-CONTROL II

With the CAM CONTROL 2 you are able to control the 3rd and 4th (GoPro) camera in the ROV.*CAM-CONTROL, X³-CONTROL, VIDEO-SWITCH
FAQ:

Why is a cable used?
A wireless communication is not possible under water. Water absorbs high frequencies very strong. To transmit a video signal frequencies are needed in the gigahertz range. Even the model building submarines can dive controlled by only a few feet - without video transmission.How to use motors in the water?Brushless-motors can be used in water without any changes. If you want to run it in saltwater, painting the coils will be necessary.
Why is there no all-in-one solution?
When
you use diving robots it is not really practical to place all sensors on the
main case because the sensor information can or shall not be recorded there. A
pressure sensor on the control unit would not be very wise because it has
to be placed in a pressure-tight case. Depending on the size and configuration of the system are parts housed in other cases. A modular system offers a free
configuration and construction of all cases and modules at low cabling work.Why no Ethernet is used for transmission of video and data?
An Ethernet limits the use of the camera systems only on webcams. But most cameras (like GoPro) have a “video-out” (yellow cinch/RCA). This signal cannot be send with data. However this video signal can be send by a cheap video-balun up to 300m(900ft) and with a second video signal by a common network-cable.Why no embedded solution (Raspberry Pi) is used?To wire the controller easily understandable provides the X³ control in a small space exactly those functions that are needed. An intricate lead out or tapping the pins is not necessary.For diving robots the power consumption of components is very important. It decides during the battery operation on the period of use. An embedded system uses and provides the components with energy all the time, which have been assembled. A specially developed control unit does not require the hardware used in embedded systems, yet these (processor) power.
Is there a gripper arm solution?
A gripper arm
is an extensive, mechanical and technical challenge. There is still no
available grappler solution, which could be integrated.Why is there no complete kit?
Constructing homemade diving robots is a growing trend. But there are rarely finished components. The crowdfunding of an american team has recently proved the substantial demand for thruster units, the T100 Thruster, which have been specially produced for the drive of watercrafts. Of course the X³ Control is compatible with the T100 and T200 thrusters.

* Source: Kickstarter.com
When I started self-construction of diving robots 7 years ago, there were only less people who tried it. The most people (like me) did not miss the creative ideas for the diving robots-drafts, but an easy to handle control solution. You were reliant on the most primitive media to realise the controlling, without any programmer skills and knowledge about microcontroller.I do not offer a complete kit, because the liberty of the modular ROV-Control system shall encourage to new diving robots concepts and thruster configurations.But I am sure there will be a larger charge of components and elements in the current age of the 3D-printers.Where can i get help?During the crowdfunding website www.rov-control.com is offline for updates. There you will  soon find more information about the construction of ROVs, a webshop with all modules and lots of accessories, as well as an English and a German-speaking forum. In the wiki all modules and their wiring are explained in English and German.

Risks & challenges
ROV-Control has given the proof in several diving robots that it works successful. From the beginning the upgrading to the full range of the module was well planned. The further development of the software was promoted in a professional way. Many of the modules are either already implemented in ROVER3D and in use or the prototypes still tested.If new sources of error would be found the process of manufacture could be delayed and costs could increase. I know these kinds of “last-minute problems” very well and that`s the reason why I have calculated some buffers.For the crowdfunding goals above 35.000 € it is not yet possible to determine the point of the start of the production run.

Who stands behind ROV-Control?
I am a 30 years old, well skilled IT systems technician and for more than seven years I am dealing with the construction of diving robots. I have developed a complete new design for diving robots and the first tests with ROVER II were very successful.At the time when I started the construction there was no control solution at all. For that reason I tried from the beginning to develop an easy to use control system with a flexible structure and an extensive software to realize individual diving robots.For a long time I was working on my own. In the meantime I work together with a very competent software engineer and expert for electronic issues. They are not named because they are not a part of this project.Both of my diving robots are 100% hand-made. I have neither used a turning machine or a CNC-milling-machine. I have just jused tools which you can find in every domestic home. Everybody can copy it....you only have to find the way to your local tool store.I really try to answer all the questions concerning the details.The new ROV-CONTROL website will be online soon with multi-language forum and more support and instruction manuals.Andreas Knabbe",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>A recent study by the UK organisation Childwise found on average today's children spend six hours a day inactive in front of screens, and just six minutes outdoors.<br/></p>
<p>As
parents, we often feel guilty about using screen-based technology to babysit
children. It keeps them occupied, but unfortunately also keeps them inactive.</p>

 harnesses the same technology which children find so spellbinding, and
turns it into something that exercises more than just their thumbs...getting them
up and active!</p><p></p><p>Brillar is the only wearable children's device you'll need. It gets kids active, keeps them social and entertained, and gives them superb levels of protection.

<p><strong>Unlike Any Other Kids' GPS Tracking Service  - The Roody Factor</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The incentive is named Roody – the hero of our app Roodymentary.
Children can design their own ‘Roody’ character – Roody (our platform), at a time of your choosing makes a personalised one-way (not a two way converstion) call to the child on their Brillar device, giving them a rudimental but stimulating challenge of your choosing. It could be cooking, spelling or a treasure
hunt. Once completed and approved by you, they then get to share that success with their pals for that all important peer recognition. It can also be used to convert any message you want into a voice message from Roody. </p>
<p>Think
Charlie's Angels meets Club Penguin, but with parents taking an active,
collaborative role. Roodymentary is about the gamification of real-world
activities to stimulate a child, encouraging learning and engagement with
friends and parents. </p>
<p>Please note you will need a Brillar device to experience the service in full.<br/></p>
<p>The
interactive nature of the app is cleverly designed to combine <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/search?espv=2&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=667&amp;site=webhp&amp;q=sedentary&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBoQvwUoAGoVChMIz_nj6JaXxwIVROsUCh1Eiwp0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><u>sedentary</u></span></a> screen play with physical activity.

<p><b>BRILLAR is
Almost Ready…</b></p>
<p>Over the
past 18 months our company has been developing, validating and refining Brillar
so that it enhances the Roodymentary experience and provides you with other
important value-added services, such as GPS tracking, geo-fencing and two-way
calling.</p>
<p>With your
help we will finish off the final hardware development along with the
firmware and the software development of the app to incorporate
tracking APIs  into the Roodymentary platform. We can then jump-start our
initial production run of 1,000 units.</p>
<p>We need
you to take this from prototype to production; we can bring Brillar to homes and families around the world and
get kids up, active and inspired with your help and support.</p>
<p>Your
contribution will allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish off the Brillar
     Tooling</li>
<li>Move from prototype to
     production</li>
<li>Finish off the tracking
     platform and integrate into Roodymentary stack</li>
<li>Finish off APIs and
     integrate Roody call set-up into the Roodymentary stack</li>
<li>Jump-start the initial
     production run of the exclusive Indiegogo 'yellow' Brillar</li>

<p><b>How long am I tied into the
service for &amp; what do we get?</b></p>
<p>We use a 30-day rolling
agreement, so you can choose to leave at any time, with no charge incurred. </p><p><b>Can we use the Brillar with our own or a different SIM card?</b><br/></p><p>Yes, you can and do not have to sign up to our rolling agreement or use our SIM card. The device will work with any Micro SIM card and can be used to recieve regular phone calls only - but you will not be able to generate calls from the device or benefit from all of the Roodymentary value added features, such as the 30 free Activities a month with personalised calls from Roody, GPS tracking, geo-fencing or alerts.</p>
<p><b>Can I change our
monthly subscription?</b></p>
<p>At
the moment we only have one price point, and we are working hard to have a few
choices added as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>How is my child’s
BRILLAR device able to communicate with my telephone?</b></p>
<p>The Brillar device communicates
using GSM technology – the same system used by your mobile phone. In Europe it
will be assigned with a UK number and in the Americas it will be assigned a US
one.</p>
<p><b>Can my child call any telephone
number using their Brillar device?</b></p>
<p>Your
child is limited to calling one of the three pre-set numbers chosen by you. But
these can be changed at any time by you through your account settings on the
app.</p>
<p><b>Can anyone ring my child’s
BRILLAR?</b></p>
<p>Only the numbers specifically
chosen by you can contact the device.</p>
<p><b>Can my child send or receive text
messages using the BRILLAR device?</b></p>
<p>The only communication functionality is the calling setting – your child
is limited to calling one of the three pre-set numbers chosen by you. They
cannot connect to the internet. Nor can they access the
internet.</p>
<p><b>How many calls can my child make
in a month?</b></p>
<p>Your
child can make up to 100 minutes of calls per month. If those minutes are used
up, we will charge per minute. They will also get 30 free Activity calls a month from Roody HQ!</p>
<p><b>Can my child use their device to
make emergency calls?</b></p>
<p>In case of emergency your child can call one of the three permitted numbers.</p>
<p><b>How accurate is the BRILLAR GPS
tracking system?</b></p>
<p>It is very accurate! Brillar’s GPS system has an ‘up-time’ of 99.99% – i.e. it’s fully operational
99.99% of the time. Your child’s Brillar device is set to ‘poll’ – i.e. take
note of your child’s location – every 10 minutes. You can, however, adjust the
service to poll either less or more frequently. Please note the shorter the
interval, the bigger the drain on the battery.</p>
<p><b>Will data collected on my child
be secure?</b></p>
<p>Yes. All collected data –
including GPS location data – is held on our secure, UK-based servers, and is
never shared with anyone.</p>
<p><b>Is Roodymentary a social
networking site for children?</b></p>
<p>Roodymentary is not a social networking site for children. With
the permission of both sets of parents/guardians, children who are friends can
view each other’s profiles to see which Activities and Playsets they have
completed. They can then show approval of these achievements with a digital
Thumbs-Up – and that is the full extent of the interaction possible. There are
no ‘status update’ or ‘instant message’ facilities.</p>
<p><b>Will I be able to use my existing
Roodymentary app when we get the BRILLAR?</b></p>
<p>You
need to download a new version, called Roodymentary+. Please keep an eye on <a href=""http://www.gloglu.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><u></u></span></a><u><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/brillar-first-wearable-device-for-kids-with-calling-and-tracking/edit/www.gloglu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.gloglu.com</u></a></u> for up-to-date instructions.</p>
<p><b>Is the BRILLAR waterproof?</b></p><p>

It is
water resistant. This means some splashing will be fine, but it should not be
submerged in water. Please refer to your box and leaflet when you first set up.</p>
<p><b>Is the BRILLAR device designed by
Glo Glu?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it has been designed by the Glo Glu team in London, and it will be
assembled in Shenzhen, China. We have spent a significant amount of time
designing and developing the device to ensure comfort, performance and
durability.</p>

greater our chance of making this a success for all.</p>
<p><b>Risks</b></p>
<p>As with any technology project, the best-laid plans
can sometimes go wrong. With tech projects especially, deadlines can get missed
due to the number of other stakeholders involved. We see the biggest threats to
our schedule a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tooling</li>
<li>Integration
     of tracking APIs into current Roodymentary app stack, and the hardware,
     firmware and software working as set out in the business requirements</li>
<li>Back-end
     bug fixing</li>
<li>Supply
     chain issues</li>
<li>Unknown
     unknowns</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Other Ways to Help</b></p>
<p>We are working with some really exciting partners
and are actively looking at open-source collaboration, so please get in touch
if you are keen to join the programme.</p>
<p>Don't worry if you are not in a position to buy a
perk right now, please just send on our campaign (with the easy-to-use
Indiegogo share tools) and become one of our advocates – it should help kids kick their screen dependency.</p>
<p>Please don't forget:</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn't

<li>With
     'Bongo Brillar' you can get the Brillar for just US$1. There will be a new
     opportunity every day of the campaign.</li>
</ol>
<p>Together we can get the kids up, active and balance
their screen time... a win-win, or, as we say, the Best of Both Worlds.</p>

The Tech That Gets Kids Active Again...


The 'Brillar' is a GSM & GPS connected wearable device and an exciting new concept in keeping your child happy, active and safe
Powered by our real world gaming app Roodymentary, the Brillar device connects your child with their virtual playmate Roody
Managed by parents through the app, Roody calls the children with a rudimental yet fun, real-time, real-world world Activity
The children are rewarded and encouraged digitally as they achieve their goals
The Brillar can also be used to make and receive calls to three numbers of your choosing
The
Brillar is fitted with a MTK GPS chipset that's constantly connected
to our platform and our cellular network  transmitting its current &
historical positioning
What problem are we solving for you?Using smart technology to get families active and collaborating together again whilst balancing screen / sedentary play with real world play.Most of today's technology is either geared towards adults or children, but there are few experiences and devices that are built for joint experiences or for combining technology experiences with real-world play.

The Brillar is an independent device and is not tethered or Bluetooth connected, having its own integrated SIM and mobile connection
It's the ultimate kids' wearable with gaming, learning, GPS tracking and auto alert notifications added to its two way calling functionality, for that added peace of mind
Interactive voice platform using smart algorithm
     that learns and tailors the suggested ‘Activities’ to your child
Brillar + Roodymentary = happy, active and secure children
We have designed it to keep families connected, and children active, social and safe
It gives you and your family the best of the real and digital worlds






Why BRILLAR?
A recent study by the UK organisation Childwise found on average today's children spend six hours a day inactive in front of screens, and just six minutes outdoors.
As
parents, we often feel guilty about using screen-based technology to babysit
children. It keeps them occupied, but unfortunately also keeps them inactive.
Brillar
 harnesses the same technology which children find so spellbinding, and
turns it into something that exercises more than just their thumbs...getting them
up and active!Brillar is the only wearable children's device you'll need. It gets kids active, keeps them social and entertained, and gives them superb levels of protection. Use it to Call, Entertain, Educate & Locate...All bases covered? We certainly think so.BRILLAR FunctionsHow It WorksParents set an activity challenge via Roodymentary app. Roody HQ calls the child directly on their device with the task...Pretty cool, huh..?As they complete their tasks, they are rewarded with stickers...Then badges and special costumes to dress Roody up withThe best bit, they get to show off and congratulate friends with our peer recognition feature

Unlike Any Other Kids' GPS Tracking Service  - The Roody Factor

The incentive is named Roody – the hero of our app Roodymentary.
Children can design their own ‘Roody’ character – Roody (our platform), at a time of your choosing makes a personalised one-way (not a two way converstion) call to the child on their Brillar device, giving them a rudimental but stimulating challenge of your choosing. It could be cooking, spelling or a treasure
hunt. Once completed and approved by you, they then get to share that success with their pals for that all important peer recognition. It can also be used to convert any message you want into a voice message from Roody. 
Think
Charlie's Angels meets Club Penguin, but with parents taking an active,
collaborative role. Roodymentary is about the gamification of real-world
activities to stimulate a child, encouraging learning and engagement with
friends and parents. 
Please note you will need a Brillar device to experience the service in full.
The
interactive nature of the app is cleverly designed to combine sedentary screen play with physical activity. It is available on iOS
and Android.  Getting them to clean their room, has never been so easy! 





Together Roodymentary and Brillar are a perfect package with many benefits. To meet Roody and find out more, visit our site.




BRILLAR is
Almost Ready…
Over the
past 18 months our company has been developing, validating and refining Brillar
so that it enhances the Roodymentary experience and provides you with other
important value-added services, such as GPS tracking, geo-fencing and two-way
calling.
With your
help we will finish off the final hardware development along with the
firmware and the software development of the app to incorporate
tracking APIs  into the Roodymentary platform. We can then jump-start our
initial production run of 1,000 units.
We need
you to take this from prototype to production; we can bring Brillar to homes and families around the world and
get kids up, active and inspired with your help and support.
Your
contribution will allow us to:

Finish off the Brillar
     Tooling
Move from prototype to
     production
Finish off the tracking
     platform and integrate into Roodymentary stack
Finish off APIs and
     integrate Roody call set-up into the Roodymentary stack
Jump-start the initial
     production run of the exclusive Indiegogo 'yellow' Brillar

The more
we raise, the more we can do.

Is the BRILLAR waterproof?

It is
water resistant. This means some splashing will be fine, but it should not be
submerged in water. Please refer to your box and leaflet when you first set up.
Is the BRILLAR device designed by
Glo Glu?

Yes, it has been designed by the Glo Glu team in London, and it will be
assembled in Shenzhen, China. We have spent a significant amount of time
designing and developing the device to ensure comfort, performance and
durability.

If We Beat Our Target We Can:

Add
     Bluetooth to Brillar
Add
     NFC to Brillar
Add
     pedometer to Brillar
Make
     Brillar 3G compatible
Add
     heat mapping
Develop
     new games in time for shipping Brillar
Develop
     a set of secret levels to be unlocked on achievement
Add
     location-based gaming
Develop
     a more sophisticated UI within the Roodymentary gaming experience
Produce     the Brillar in a range of colours
Localise
     the service and have Roody in different languages, such as Spanish,
     Mandarin & Arabic

Impact
Any help will have a significant impact on our campaign.
It doesn't matter if you buy a perk or send an email referring us on to someone
else. It's as simple as this – the more people who know about our campaign, the
greater our chance of making this a success for all.
Risks
As with any technology project, the best-laid plans
can sometimes go wrong. With tech projects especially, deadlines can get missed
due to the number of other stakeholders involved. We see the biggest threats to
our schedule a:

Tooling
Integration
     of tracking APIs into current Roodymentary app stack, and the hardware,
     firmware and software working as set out in the business requirements
Back-end
     bug fixing
Supply
     chain issues
Unknown
     unknowns

Other Ways to Help
We are working with some really exciting partners
and are actively looking at open-source collaboration, so please get in touch
if you are keen to join the programme.
Don't worry if you are not in a position to buy a
perk right now, please just send on our campaign (with the easy-to-use
Indiegogo share tools) and become one of our advocates – it should help kids kick their screen dependency.
Please don't forget:

It doesn't
     cost to refer (use the Indiegogo share tools)
With
     our 'Refer Are Us' Perk, the first to refer US$5,000 in perks will get a
     free Brillar and a subscription for life
With
     'Bongo Brillar' you can get the Brillar for just US$1. There will be a new
     opportunity every day of the campaign.

Together we can get the kids up, active and balance
their screen time... a win-win, or, as we say, the Best of Both Worlds.
And that's all there is to it. We know the hard work starts now. What are you waiting
for... an invite from President Obama?
'We've been trying to initiate ways to get more
children and young people to use the parks. And, as you said, so many of these
kids are growing up cut off. They're sitting on the couch, they're playing
video games; if they experience nature, it's through a television screen and
just getting them out there so that they're picking up that rock and finding
that slug, they're seeing that bird with colours that they haven't seen before.'

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p style=""font-size: 14pt; color: #404040;"">Earless, is a social networking solution with a radical difference: it has built-in respect for your personal information. While present social networks are deliberately designed to collect information about people, both personal information and by analyzing their communication, which they then monetize directly or through targeted advertisement, Earless is purposefully constructed in such ways so that it cannot access your personal information or your communication even if the people behind it wanted to or were asked/requested to do so. Earless combines a fresh approach with proven cryptographic technologies to create a socializing environment that delivers all the functionality and benefits of a classical social network but at the same time keeping your private information, private.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1425745255/zmcizqnnvxweg698dsdd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are at a turning point. The seemingly innocuous information that is being collected from each of us on a daily basis, combined with the increasingly cheaper cost of storage and the exponential increase in computation power, is setting us up for a perfect storm. When all the pieces fall into place, these companies will have an accurate model which they can use to predict and manipulate society at large. We blame governments for spying on us, and with good reason, because instead of protecting us they happily tap into this information paradise to make their job easier, but the way things progress, tomorrow's Big Brother, will be traded on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Social networks are one of the biggest vectors that facilitate this trend because people inadvertently disclose enormous amounts of details about themselves, their friends and their environment, simply because, well, that's what socializing is about: we expose ourselves amongst our friends. We often just dismiss the uneasy thought that the network itself is peering down on us, because there is little or no alternative, plus if they all do it, after a while it just becomes normal. We think it is not, so we created Earless, a social network where you can disclose yourself among your friends without being watched by who knows who.</p>
<p>We are a very small team, from various backgrounds like IT and social sciences, but with a crazy ambitious goal: to disrupt this vicious trend by giving everybody an alternative to hold onto their privacy and by this to restore the informational balance between society at large and these giant corporations. To us, any other outcome is unthinkable.</p><p></p>
<hr/><h3>Where is Earless Now <span style=""font-weight: normal; color: #606060;"">( Existing Functionality )</span>
</h3>
<p>The Earless Network is a mediated peer-to-peer social network, which means that the server only acts as a middle man in the information exchange and the data resides on the sender's computer and the computer of the person it is being sent to. Data reaches the server in its encrypted form and is stored there only temporarily. When all recipients downloaded the information, the content of the message is purged from the server.</p>
<p>Communication in Earless has a strong end-to-end character. The inner layer encryption employs a 2048 bit RSA asymmetric algorithm which links messages back to their sender. Messages sent by ""Person A"" to ""Person B"" have a different encryption than messages sent by ""Person B"" to ""Person C"", even if ""B"" is re-sharing the information received from ""A"". Therefore unlike with email, the author of a message cannot masquarade as a friend. By the same token, you cannot accidentally send your message to a total stranger, because if he or she doesn't have the key you shared with your friends, he or she cannot read your messages.</p>
<p>In spite of these stringent security constraints, which make Earless well suited for businesses too, the dynamics of the application are very much like that of your usual social network, and more:</p>

<p>Our resource needs are linear. They basically grow proportionally with the number of users in the network.

<p>We greatly appreciate and respect all those walking with us.</p>
<hr/><h3>Roadmap Continued <span style=""font-weight: normal; color: #606060;"">( Where We See Earless )</span>
</h3>
<p>The history of Earless will not end with the ""Public Opening"", in fact that's when it really starts. By this time, with your help, we hope we will extended our infrastructure sufficiently to turn it into a self sustaining mechanism, and we will have fine tuned the network and fixed sufficient bugs to be able to bring Earless out of beta. During all this period our focus will mainly be on perfecting what exists today in Earless.</p>
<p>At that point we will split our efforts in two: continue to grow the network by opening it to more and more people, and growing Earless's functionality suite to cover a larger spectrum of communication pathways. We know that people need to use many different communication methods, so the more of these methods we cover, the better our privacy umbrella becomes.</p>
<p>While we have ambitious plans with regards to the future set of functionality, the timeline for the implementation is somewhat uncertain and it is not captured within the scope of the current crowd-funding campaign. However if we do manage to raise more than it is necessary for our immediate goal, we would be able to fast-track some or all of these enhancements, based on the amount raised and their priority.</p>
<div style=""background: #50C020; padding-left: 10px;""><p style=""background: #F0F0F0; padding: 10px;"">An estimated <b>$300K</b> would help us build <b>mobile clients for Earless</b>. Should we raise in between this and our targeted base, we will prioritize building these clients. We are going to get back to you with a poll to evaluate the importance of each of these clients to the community, and build them accordingly.</p></div>
<div style=""background: #50C020; padding-left: 10px;""><p style=""background: #F0F0F0; padding: 10px;"">At around <b>$500K</b> we estimate we would be able to expand our team sufficiently to implement, <b>chat</b>, <b>group chat</b>, <b>direct video sharing</b>, <b>voice messages</b> and <b>video messages</b>.</p></div>
<div style=""background: #50C020; padding-left: 10px;""><p style=""background: #F0F0F0; padding: 10px;"">We estimate <b>$1M</b> would help us build <b>voice-to-voice communication</b> that benefit from the stringent security measures Earless adheres to. With some luck, we may even be able to develop <b>voice conferencing</b> and <b>video calls</b> within this frame.</p></div>
<div style=""background: #50C020; padding-left: 10px;""><p style=""background: #F0F0F0; padding: 10px;"">This is probably the coolest feature but it is also the most expensive and as such, last on our list. <b>Group Video Conferencing</b> is difficult to solve even without encryption. Witness to this, the limited number of solutions on the market. Within the context of our rigid encryption rules, this will be an order of magnitude harder. We are not even going to put a price point on this, nevertheless, we consider it to be a very important summit and we will redirect available resources into achieving it.</p></div>
<p>Thank you very much for all your help!</p>
<hr/><h3>Cost Structure</h3>
<p>We have estimated a fair value cost for the Earless Service of $18 a year, which amounts to $1.5 a month. However, we realize that even this low price per month, which is less than a coffee in most countries, some people may not be able to pay, so we devised a somewhat unconventional charging system, where we give an unconditional discount. Additionally we also provide a completely free version which has a connection limit but otherwise is fully functional.</p>
<p>We also offer the possibility for people to pay more than the fair value if they have the possibility, this way we hope to offset the loss we incur with our discount and free service. If this call is going to be answered, we are going to increase our discount rate accordingly. We are hopeful that people will understand that it is not enough if 10% of the population has privacy protection. The inability of those who cannot pay for their privacy will be exploited and if they form the majority, this will drag the minority and society in general in that direction. Rich and poor, our destinies are linked.</p>

<hr/><h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
<p>For any questions you have regarding Earless please contact us through our Indiegogo campaign, through our website (<a href=""http://www.earless.net/contact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contact page</a>), or email us directly at support@earless.net.</p><p></p>
<p>Here are some of the questions we've been asked so far:</p>
<h4>How can I get on the waiting list?</h4>
<p>The easiest way to get into the waiting list is to download and install the application and register to reserve your user name. This process does not require any personal information and although your account will be initially blocked, you will have reserved your user name and your place in the line. As we increase our resources, we will be unblocking batches of accounts in the order of registration.</p>
<p>Exceptions from this rule are those who purchase subscription plans during the fundraising campaign, who will receive priority access according to the perk purchased. They can also ask for prioritization of their potential connections.</p>
<h4>How will I receive my perk?</h4>
<p>Except for the stickers, your perk will consist in one or more ""Earless Codes"", which you will receive electronically. After you installed the desktop, simply follow the instructions to claim your gift (subscription plan or priority access), everything will be in the code.</p>
<p>Note: Codes can be used a single time and for a single account</p>
<h4>How can I ask for the prioritization of a connection?</h4>
<p>You must first use your perk to unlock your account and get your subscription. Ask your potential connection to join the network as well to get onto the waiting list. Then simply send a connection request to this person. The pending connection request from an active subscription will place the target account on the priority list.</p>
<p>Note: Please understand that although we will treat these accounts with priority, we can only get to them after we honor all subscriptions purchased during the fundraising.</p>
<h4>So the server can see these connection requests?</h4>
<p>The server can see that it is a connection request, who the requesting user name is, and to which user name is directed. The content of the request will be encoded with your key so we do not have access to it. The key exchange is a two step, two pathway process designed to protect your key while in transit from both us, the network, and anybody who might intercept it. It's a neat process, if you are curious how it works, please see here: <a href=""https://www.earless.net/blog/display?id=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Connecting in a safe way</a>.</p>
<h4>If you have end-to-end encryption, how come I can receive messages from the Earless Administrator account?</h4>
<p>The Earless Administrator account has a special status, it is basically half-a-connection to you, which means that you can receive messages from the administrator but the administrator cannot receive messages from you. This is because you have the administrator's public key (it is shipped with the installation) but we do not have your public key. So even if you sent messages to the administrator we would not be able to read it.
This needs to stay like this, so if you want to contact us, please do so on our portal or write us an email.</p>
<h4>Where are your servers located?</h4>
<p>Presently our servers are located in Germany but this location is really irrelevant because any block of data that contains your personal information or communication is encrypted with your key, the one that we do not have access to. Since we do not have this key it cannot be stolen from us, so your information and data remain safe even in the unlikely event our database got hacked.</p>
<h4>How safe is this key anyways?</h4>
<p>The Earless asymmetric encryption employs a 2048 bit RSA algorithm, which although is not considered unbreakable, it would take a very, very long time to break and enormous amounts of computational power. By the estimation of a reputable certificate authority, (see <a href=""https://www.digicert.com/TimeTravel/math.htm),"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.digicert.com/TimeTravel/math.htm),</a> it would take 6.4 quadrillion years for a standard desktop computer to crack such an encryption. This is much longer than the time scientists estimate our universe will live for. That being said, Internet security analysts recommend the use of 2048 bit key for asymmetric encryption. While the 1024 bit key is now considered to be breakable within reasonable time-frame, the 2048 key, which is 2^32 (~ 4.3 billion) times harder to crack that the 1024 bit key, is considered to be safe for several decades to come. While it is impossible to state with a 100% certainty that the key is unbreakable, this safeness should hold true, even if we factor in the progress in IT and the fact that code breakers would employ supercomputers not desktops.</p>
<h4>Why not a browser based application?</h4>
<p>There are two main reasons why Earless is a desktop based application:</p>
<p>a). Browsers based application are extremely insecure. Based on the 2014 vulnerability report (<a href=""http://www.gfi.com/blog/most-vulnerable-operating-systems-and-applications-in-2014/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.gfi.com/blog/most-vulnerable-operati...</a>), browsers account for more than half of all application vulnerabilities. By building a browser based application, these vulnerabilities would form a baggage we would deliver to you together with our application and even worse, this would be something that would not be in our power to fix. This is not what we had in mind when we built Earless.</p>
<p>b). Even if the browser environment would be 100% foolproof, there would still be a problem that would eliminate it as a suitable platform for Earless. In a browser based application (your typical SOA), the entire application resides on the server, even the UI is rendered at server side into HTML + Java Script code and the browser (on your computer) only displays it. Even if this application runs through SSL, the information that travels inside the SSL channel is not encrypted. In other words your communication is encrypted to the outside world, but it is not encrypted to the server your sending it to. While this is logical in SOA environment, it also means that the server has access to your personal information and communication no matter what, which is exactly the problem we wanted to eliminate. With Earless, the server receives your information in an already encrypted form, therefore it cannot access it. This is only possible if the encryption, and thus the computation, is done not on the server, but on your computer.</p>
<h4>Does it mean that if I start using Earless the privacy issues will be solved?</h4>
<p>Well, yes and no. If you and everybody else would only be using Earless, privacy would not be an issue, but it is hard to imagine that this would be possible. Earless provides means for private and secure communication, so use it as often as you can to preserve your privacy. Information that you exchange there will not be tracked by anybody, stored or analyzed in any way, but phones will continue to require you to log into your account and Smart TV's and other gadgets will do the same. But if sufficient people start using Earless, they will become aware of this danger of privacy violation and will start voicing their concern, they will force their governments to act upon it. Instead of joining in with the personal information hoarding, as the current tendency is, they will act to regulate what these giant corporations do with the information they gather. This is the Earless long term vision.</p>
<h4>How can I help, other than contributing?</h4>
<p>You can share our message with your friends, and make them aware we exist and ask them to do the same. You can also download the application and register in the network. Although your account will be blocked for the moment, this will help us a great deal, because we will be able to assess the demand which is an important factor in the infrastructure deployment decision.
</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p></div>","Earless, is a social networking solution with a radical difference: it has built-in respect for your personal information. While present social networks are deliberately designed to collect information about people, both personal information and by analyzing their communication, which they then monetize directly or through targeted advertisement, Earless is purposefully constructed in such ways so that it cannot access your personal information or your communication even if the people behind it wanted to or were asked/requested to do so. Earless combines a fresh approach with proven cryptographic technologies to create a socializing environment that delivers all the functionality and benefits of a classical social network but at the same time keeping your private information, private.

We are at a turning point. The seemingly innocuous information that is being collected from each of us on a daily basis, combined with the increasingly cheaper cost of storage and the exponential increase in computation power, is setting us up for a perfect storm. When all the pieces fall into place, these companies will have an accurate model which they can use to predict and manipulate society at large. We blame governments for spying on us, and with good reason, because instead of protecting us they happily tap into this information paradise to make their job easier, but the way things progress, tomorrow's Big Brother, will be traded on Wall Street.
Social networks are one of the biggest vectors that facilitate this trend because people inadvertently disclose enormous amounts of details about themselves, their friends and their environment, simply because, well, that's what socializing is about: we expose ourselves amongst our friends. We often just dismiss the uneasy thought that the network itself is peering down on us, because there is little or no alternative, plus if they all do it, after a while it just becomes normal. We think it is not, so we created Earless, a social network where you can disclose yourself among your friends without being watched by who knows who.
We are a very small team, from various backgrounds like IT and social sciences, but with a crazy ambitious goal: to disrupt this vicious trend by giving everybody an alternative to hold onto their privacy and by this to restore the informational balance between society at large and these giant corporations. To us, any other outcome is unthinkable.
Where is Earless Now ( Existing Functionality )

The Earless Network is a mediated peer-to-peer social network, which means that the server only acts as a middle man in the information exchange and the data resides on the sender's computer and the computer of the person it is being sent to. Data reaches the server in its encrypted form and is stored there only temporarily. When all recipients downloaded the information, the content of the message is purged from the server.
Communication in Earless has a strong end-to-end character. The inner layer encryption employs a 2048 bit RSA asymmetric algorithm which links messages back to their sender. Messages sent by ""Person A"" to ""Person B"" have a different encryption than messages sent by ""Person B"" to ""Person C"", even if ""B"" is re-sharing the information received from ""A"". Therefore unlike with email, the author of a message cannot masquarade as a friend. By the same token, you cannot accidentally send your message to a total stranger, because if he or she doesn't have the key you shared with your friends, he or she cannot read your messages.
In spite of these stringent security constraints, which make Earless well suited for businesses too, the dynamics of the application are very much like that of your usual social network, and more:





Double layer encryption protects all your data from outside eavesdroppers,




End-to-end encryption protects all your data from the server,




Zero knowledge, the server knows nothing about you (personal information or communication),




No advertisement, third party or any kind,



You can share simple text in a blink of an eye,




The story share functionality allows you to write rich text messages to emphasize your creativity,




Embed and watch video you host on your favorite channel,



Share images, both individually or in bulk, apply size optimization and rotation while you are at it,



Organize images in albums and share them with ease, 



Organize various types of posts in conversations to keep them together,



Exchange documents (files in general),




Control the degree of privacy of your message,




Comment yours or other people's posts,




Organize documents with a hierarchical tagging structure so that you find important documents easier,









Group your connections in categories and address them as one, avoiding awkward selection of friends during sharing process,



View your messages in timeline and filter them by tag or by connection,



You can export documents, or choose to view them directly in the Operating System default viewer,



Being a desktop application, Earless integrates much better with the operating system than the usual social network. It also has a built-in web browser which is full Java Script enabled and temporarily accepts cookies, this allows for functionality you will not find in a web based social network.






Open shared links in the operating system browser,





Browse shared links with the built-in browser,




Browse anywhere you like and lose your trail; when you exit the application all cookies will be purged,




Take screenshots of pages and only show relevant content,



Take screenshots of pages behind log-in and share them with your connections (connections will not be able to browse to these pages, but will be able to see the screenshot),



You can do all these without leaving a trail of breadcrumbs behind you because the page sharing system works radically different from the usual web based social network.
Roadmap ( Where Will the Funds Go )

All of the above functionality is already built into the Earless system which although in beta, is fully functional. Because of this, we believe we will be able to give access to all contributors within a relatively short period.




We structured the growth of the network into four waves, because we want to make sure everybody on board has a good user experience. Only when this is ensured, will we move further to the next wave.



We estimate that our present infrastructure will be capable to handle the first two waves of members, therefore, we intend to start delivering to those who buy into these waves even before our campaign ends, with the ""Early Access, 1st Wave Members"" starting to receive access as early as 3 to 7 days.



After we make sure the first wave of members have a quality user experience, we will proceed with delivering the perks for the second wave of members. Based on our estimation, this will happen between 6 to 8 weeks. This will be an important step in Earless's development because it will help us calibrate the load on our servers and determine the parameters of the infrastructure we need.



With the funds raised up to the goal of this campaign, we are going to upgrade our server infrastructure. This process will take some time (we estimate 10 to 12 weeks), so please be patient. We will do our best to hasten the process and we will keep you apprised of the evolution of things.



The ""Early Public Opening"" is an intermediate step we reserved to ensure that we can make good for everybody who participated in our campaign. While we remain committed to the goal of the campaign, to have a ""Public Opening"", we'd like to provision for the situation that we will have a lot of participants, and deployment will be more difficult than expected. If that were the case, a delayed public opening will help us better deliver on our promises.



If we raise our goal, the infrastructure that we will be able to acquire will help us kick-start an organic growth process in which we will have enough resources to accommodate new clients that will pay for further growth and so on. Provided that we reach our goal, the public opening will follow soon after the ""Early Public Opening"" and we will start opening bigger batches of users, potentially even eliminating the account limit completely.



Our resource needs are linear. They basically grow proportionally with the number of users in the network. Due to this, we feel confident that even if we do not meet the goal, we will be able to accommodate the number of people that contributed to the fundraising and at least a small circle of their friends. While this road would be a lot harder, and it will take much longer, it is a road we are committed walk.
We greatly appreciate and respect all those walking with us.
Roadmap Continued ( Where We See Earless )

The history of Earless will not end with the ""Public Opening"", in fact that's when it really starts. By this time, with your help, we hope we will extended our infrastructure sufficiently to turn it into a self sustaining mechanism, and we will have fine tuned the network and fixed sufficient bugs to be able to bring Earless out of beta. During all this period our focus will mainly be on perfecting what exists today in Earless.
At that point we will split our efforts in two: continue to grow the network by opening it to more and more people, and growing Earless's functionality suite to cover a larger spectrum of communication pathways. We know that people need to use many different communication methods, so the more of these methods we cover, the better our privacy umbrella becomes.
While we have ambitious plans with regards to the future set of functionality, the timeline for the implementation is somewhat uncertain and it is not captured within the scope of the current crowd-funding campaign. However if we do manage to raise more than it is necessary for our immediate goal, we would be able to fast-track some or all of these enhancements, based on the amount raised and their priority.
An estimated $300K would help us build mobile clients for Earless. Should we raise in between this and our targeted base, we will prioritize building these clients. We are going to get back to you with a poll to evaluate the importance of each of these clients to the community, and build them accordingly.
At around $500K we estimate we would be able to expand our team sufficiently to implement, chat, group chat, direct video sharing, voice messages and video messages.
We estimate $1M would help us build voice-to-voice communication that benefit from the stringent security measures Earless adheres to. With some luck, we may even be able to develop voice conferencing and video calls within this frame.
This is probably the coolest feature but it is also the most expensive and as such, last on our list. Group Video Conferencing is difficult to solve even without encryption. Witness to this, the limited number of solutions on the market. Within the context of our rigid encryption rules, this will be an order of magnitude harder. We are not even going to put a price point on this, nevertheless, we consider it to be a very important summit and we will redirect available resources into achieving it.
Thank you very much for all your help!
Cost Structure
We have estimated a fair value cost for the Earless Service of $18 a year, which amounts to $1.5 a month. However, we realize that even this low price per month, which is less than a coffee in most countries, some people may not be able to pay, so we devised a somewhat unconventional charging system, where we give an unconditional discount. Additionally we also provide a completely free version which has a connection limit but otherwise is fully functional.
We also offer the possibility for people to pay more than the fair value if they have the possibility, this way we hope to offset the loss we incur with our discount and free service. If this call is going to be answered, we are going to increase our discount rate accordingly. We are hopeful that people will understand that it is not enough if 10% of the population has privacy protection. The inability of those who cannot pay for their privacy will be exploited and if they form the majority, this will drag the minority and society in general in that direction. Rich and poor, our destinies are linked.




		Family Edition ( < 10 Connections ), Free
	



		We call it family edition but we don't know who you are or who your family is. Use the application for free for up to 10 connections, no questions asked.
		Starting from the moment you exceed the the 10 connections, you will have a 1 month period to choose a plan
	







Low Income Edition, $9 / year or $0.75 / month

		You should understand however that abusing this option can have a negative effect on our 
		business and our capacity to continue providing our service to everyone in the future. 
		Use this edition only if you really have to.
	







Fair Value Edition, $18 / year or $1.5 / month



		This is what we consider a fair price. Unless you want to provide extra support choose this edition.
	







Philanthropist Edition, > $27 / year or > $2.25 / month



		This is a good will surcharge :). By choosing this option you endorse our philosophy and you provide extended support to our quest for enforcing respect towards people's privacy. Please understand that we cannot advertise your participation as this would create pressure on your peers.
		While your gesture is purely philanthropic, it means a lot to us and it is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much!

If you have end-to-end encryption, how come I can receive messages from the Earless Administrator account?
The Earless Administrator account has a special status, it is basically half-a-connection to you, which means that you can receive messages from the administrator but the administrator cannot receive messages from you. This is because you have the administrator's public key (it is shipped with the installation) but we do not have your public key. So even if you sent messages to the administrator we would not be able to read it.
This needs to stay like this, so if you want to contact us, please do so on our portal or write us an email.
Where are your servers located?
Presently our servers are located in Germany but this location is really irrelevant because any block of data that contains your personal information or communication is encrypted with your key, the one that we do not have access to. Since we do not have this key it cannot be stolen from us, so your information and data remain safe even in the unlikely event our database got hacked.
How safe is this key anyways?
The Earless asymmetric encryption employs a 2048 bit RSA algorithm, which although is not considered unbreakable, it would take a very, very long time to break and enormous amounts of computational power. By the estimation of a reputable certificate authority, (see https://www.digicert.com/TimeTravel/math.htm), it would take 6.4 quadrillion years for a standard desktop computer to crack such an encryption. This is much longer than the time scientists estimate our universe will live for. That being said, Internet security analysts recommend the use of 2048 bit key for asymmetric encryption. While the 1024 bit key is now considered to be breakable within reasonable time-frame, the 2048 key, which is 2^32 (~ 4.3 billion) times harder to crack that the 1024 bit key, is considered to be safe for several decades to come. While it is impossible to state with a 100% certainty that the key is unbreakable, this safeness should hold true, even if we factor in the progress in IT and the fact that code breakers would employ supercomputers not desktops.
Why not a browser based application?
There are two main reasons why Earless is a desktop based application:
a). Browsers based application are extremely insecure. Based on the 2014 vulnerability report (http://www.gfi.com/blog/most-vulnerable-operati...), browsers account for more than half of all application vulnerabilities. By building a browser based application, these vulnerabilities would form a baggage we would deliver to you together with our application and even worse, this would be something that would not be in our power to fix. This is not what we had in mind when we built Earless.
b). Even if the browser environment would be 100% foolproof, there would still be a problem that would eliminate it as a suitable platform for Earless. In a browser based application (your typical SOA), the entire application resides on the server, even the UI is rendered at server side into HTML + Java Script code and the browser (on your computer) only displays it. Even if this application runs through SSL, the information that travels inside the SSL channel is not encrypted. In other words your communication is encrypted to the outside world, but it is not encrypted to the server your sending it to. While this is logical in SOA environment, it also means that the server has access to your personal information and communication no matter what, which is exactly the problem we wanted to eliminate. With Earless, the server receives your information in an already encrypted form, therefore it cannot access it. This is only possible if the encryption, and thus the computation, is done not on the server, but on your computer.
Does it mean that if I start using Earless the privacy issues will be solved?
Well, yes and no. If you and everybody else would only be using Earless, privacy would not be an issue, but it is hard to imagine that this would be possible. Earless provides means for private and secure communication, so use it as often as you can to preserve your privacy. Information that you exchange there will not be tracked by anybody, stored or analyzed in any way, but phones will continue to require you to log into your account and Smart TV's and other gadgets will do the same. But if sufficient people start using Earless, they will become aware of this danger of privacy violation and will start voicing their concern, they will force their governments to act upon it. Instead of joining in with the personal information hoarding, as the current tendency is, they will act to regulate what these giant corporations do with the information they gather. This is the Earless long term vision.
How can I help, other than contributing?
You can share our message with your friends, and make them aware we exist and ask them to do the same. You can also download the application and register in the network. Although your account will be blocked for the moment, this will help us a great deal, because we will be able to assess the demand which is an important factor in the infrastructure deployment decision.

Any help is greatly appreciated.",34.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","Flexible Charging Solutions For the Whole Family! Androids, tablets, iPhones and iPads. There's bound to be a few at home. Charging them can be a hassle sometimes, and always a mess.
There are charging stations that organise the cables, but none really solve the problem of multiple devices laying on the table.



Does this look familiar?
We thought to ourselves; there has to be a better way!
We created the Zentree just for that purpose! Not only does it handle cable management, but it also provides a soft flexible surface which supports multiple devices of different sizes.



The top is made of a soft silicone rubber which protects your devices from bumps and scratches. Viewing angle can be customised if you want to watch a movie while it's on the Zentree.


   Where you come in GELID Solutions isn't a new company, we have experience in production. GELID Solutions is a Swiss company that is strategically based in Hong Kong to aid in our communications with factories in China.
The R&D phase is complete and we have working samples produced that we will send to relevant agencies for necessary certifications.
We need your help to fund the final plastic and silicone mold for production.









If all goes well, we'll be shipping Q1 of 2016!

    
Risks & Challenges Does our product work? Yes it does! We have multiple working prototypes already. The prototypes are 90% of what the final product is going to be.
The smart IC which auto-negotiates the best charging current for your device has also been tried and tested.

How do I upgrade my perk to a better one?
Awesome! If you'd like to upgrade your perk to a high-priced perk, you can do so on the contributions tab of your Indiegogo profile. For example, if you originally claimed a USD 5 perk but now wish to upgrade to a $50 perk, you can click ""Upgrade to Higher Priced Perk""next to your USD 5 perk. This will direct you back to the contribution flow. You can then select the new higher-priced perk you would like to claim.

<p>
</p><p><b>An Advanced &amp; Beautiful Design</b></p>
<p>Built from 30 interlocking components, NathLock was created to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Beautiful</p></li>
<li><p>Resilient</p></li>
<li><p>Water
Resistant</p></li>
<li><p>Long-Lasting</p></li>
<li><p>Secure</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Beautiful</b></p>
<p>With attention to detail for aesthetics, we built NathLock to be the same
size as a standard padlock, but with soft curves and an in-line bevel to give
it a streamlined look that fits in at any location. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438040738/tzsin4b2rtbcxbfa3jjy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Resilient</b></p>
<p>Forged from hardened steel and boron, we built NathLock to withstand even
the most extreme conditions and cunning criminals. With included anti-shim
technology, nothing gets past Nathlock. </p>
<p><b>Water Resistant</b></p>
<p>Since NathLock can be used anywhere, we took the time to make sure no water
would ever get in. With four form-fitting grubber gaskets and a lack of
exterior buttons, NathLock is safe to use, even in rainy conditions. </p>
<p><b>Long-Lasting</b></p>
<p>NathLock is built to last. With an included battery made to last for at
least one-year, you won’t ever be stranded. Should your battery die, we make it
easy to replace without the need for tools. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438040783/jmthyvrwoa3pir3seb3i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Secure</b></p>
<p>By using industry leading Bluetooth 4.0 that utilizes 128-bit encryption,
and our very own PKI technology with cryptographic key exchange protocols,
NathLock is safe from criminals, hackers, and thieves. </p>
<p><b>A Battery Built to Last</b></p>
<p>To remove worry about when your battery will die, NathLock is set up so that
you receive notifications to your phone well before the battery is going to
die. When you need to replace the battery, we made it simple so you don’t have
to stress. Just unlock NathLock and unscrew the back. The battery will easily
pop out and allow you to replace it with another. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What if the battery dies completely? It’s unlikely, but should it happen you
can “jump start” NathLock by pressing a replacement battery against the contact
points (see pictures for details) which will allow you to unlock NathLock and
replace the battery. There are no wires to mess with, no exposed ports to ruin
your lock, and best of all, no expensive batteries. It costs as much as a pair
of AA’s. </p>
<p><b>How We Developed Nathlock</b></p>
<p>When we researched Nathlock, we looked at the best locks on the market,
deconstructed them, and found out where they were vulnerable, and what parts
weren’t. We used this information to craft the most secure and advanced padlock
in the world. It was challenging, and at times seemingly impossible, but we did
it all to give the world what it needed: a lock that’s simple enough for a
child to use, but able to thwart even the best thieves and criminals. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438040844/mtzg3ljzgt4qyxeajc42.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>The Timeline for Nathlock’s Development</b></p>
<p>Since we have already spent the time researching, developing, testing, and
retesting the design, hardware, software, and even the firmware, we are finally
gearing up for world stage release. We have chosen a leading manufacturer to
build NathLock, but rest assured, we will keep improving Nathlock as necessary
for its public release. Anyone luckily enough to receive one as a beta will
subject NathLock to unimaginable conditions to ensure that our lock is
second-to-none. Once it’s perfect to our exacting standards, mass-production
will begin and Nathlock will be ready for delivery. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438594269/kzj3gqpo2dyrlm0hcny7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><strong>As part of the launch and on a limited time offer only, we’re offering a very limited gold edition of the NathLock Padlock.

<p><b>About Us</b></p>
<p>Founded by Reagan Orr and Marco Cia, NATHLOCK Designs was established on the
principles of developing the most advanced products for today’s electronic
devices. Incorporating designs that have gone through rigorous testing and
using established development methods, NATHLOCK innovates products to create
comprehensive solutions for today’s consumers. </p>
<p><strong>Reagan Orr</strong></p>
<p>Prior to his work with NATHLOCK Designs, Reagan Orr was the Director of
Product Development at Creative Bulb where he invented in excess of twelve
products spanning audio products, Lightings, power accessories, and gaming
products. His products, both from his time at Creative Bulb and elsewhere, have
received numerous awards and accolades, including four CES Design and
Engineering awards. </p>
<p><strong>Marco Cia</strong> </p>
<p>Prior to his work with NATHLOCK Designs, Marco Cia spent more than a decade
working within the consumer electronics industry with leading corporations such
as SZN TECH and Nath Tech. While employed at SZN TECH as a Product and
Marketing Manager, he helped to establish them as one of the fastest growing
companies in its field. As the Senior Product Manager at Nath Tech, he oversaw
and personally led the development of several of Nath Tech’s most popular and
award winning products in the security field, such as their first Bluetooth Pad
Lock. </p>
<p>Team Introduction</p>
<p>NATHLOCK creator Nath Technology has a team of professionals which </p>
<p>combine the fields in both hardware and software. At the beginning stage, it
</p>
<p>mainly helps a renowned listed company (STOCK, TOUCHLING, VIX </p>
<p>MERCHANET etc.) to develop and design products, the team is equipped with </p>
<p>rich hardware and software product development experience. After one year </p>
<p>of development, we are currently equipped with a mature structure in </p>
<p>product planning, product related technology development and quality
control. </p>
<p>All the products in Nath Technology can produced by in professional factory </p>
<p>country, this further guarantee the product manufacturing quality.</p>
<p><b>Our Press Kit Can Be Found Here:</b></p>
<p>The Risks and Challenges</p>
<p>As former product developers for successful companies, we are intimately
acquainted with what it takes to deliver a superior product on a firm delivery
schedule. For the past several months, we have been working tirelessly to not
only design, but also refine and test our product so that it is absolutely
perfect for the consumer market. But rest assured, the photos and video you see
are of the finished product. </p>
<p>So what are the risks? With every product comes the risk that manufacturing,
packaging, or even shipping could delay the product launch. For a successful
launch, all components must work perfectly and sadly, some of these aspects are
out of our control. </p>
<p>However, because we have an established working relationship with the
manufacturer, and given our intimate knowledge of the design process, we should
be able to quickly resolve any issues as they arise. But regardless of delays
or on time delivery schedules, we will keep you informed at each and every
step. </p>
<p>Learn more about our accountability through our website. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438042769/kyxcdicfrwofz0nnfftc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>FAQ </b><b>What devices are supported?</b></p>
<p>NathLock is compatible with select iOS, Android, and Windows phones devices.</p>
<p>For iOS: NathLock is compatible with devices that have Bluetooth 4.0 and are
running iOS 8.0 or later (which includes iPhone 4s or newer, iPod Touch 5G or
newer, iPad 3G or newer, and iPad minis).</p>
<p>For Android: NathLock is compatible with devices that have Bluetooth 4.0 and
are running Jelly Bean (4.3) or Kit Kat (4.4). Includes the Samsung Galaxy S4
or newer, HTC One or newer, and many more. </p>
<p>For Windows Phone: NathLock is compatible with devices that have Bluetooth
4.0 and are running Windows Mobile 8.1 or newer.</p>
<p><b>What happens if the battery dies while NathLock is locked?</b></p>
<p>While a rare occurrence since the NathLock app shows you the battery level
every time you use it and we give you a warning several months before the
battery dies, it is still theoretically possible. Should this happen, we have
included the ability to ""jump-start"" your NathLock with an external
battery. Simply place the battery to the contact leads (per the operating
manual) to allow you to unlock the NathLock. You can then open the back and
replace the battery.</p>
<p><b>How secure is Bluetooth?</b></p>
<p>Because NathLock uses the industry standard Bluetooth 4.0, it offers the
highest level of security available from a Bluetooth device. Bluetooth 4.0 uses
the 128-bit AES CCM encryption algorithm, which ensures that all transmissions
are encrypted and secure. Bluetooth 4.0 devices are significantly more secure
than older Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p><b>Does NathLock add any encryption to standard Bluetooth encryption?</b></p>
<p>Yes, in addition to the standard Bluetooth encryption, we gave NathLock the
latest in PKI technology and a cryptographic key exchange protocol to help keep
all communications with your NathLock device secure.</p>
<p><b>What type of battery does NathLock use?</b></p>
<p>While the final battery selection will occur over the next couple months, we
do know that it will be a standard watch battery that is not only easy to find
but is also inexpensive. </p>
<p><b>How secure is NathLock?</b></p>
<p>NathLock has several security features built in to help it become among the
most secure products available on the market. In the pursuit of security, from
both criminals and the elements, we have incorporated:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bluetooth
4.0</p></li>
<li><p>Water
Resistance</p></li>
<li><p>An
Impervious Design</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bluetooth: Nathlock uses the industry standard Bluetooth 4.0 with a 128 bit
AES CCM encryption algorithm so all transmissions are not only secure, but also
encrypted. </p>
<p>Water Resistance: Because you can’t control the weather, we made NathLock
water resistant so you can use it anywhere worry free. </p>
<p>Impervious Design: To make it virtually impossible for thieves to steal the
NathLock, we built it out of hardened boron and even included anti-shim
technology. </p>
<p><b>Can I disable the auto-unlock feature?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. To disable this feature, simply log into the app and select it
as the default setting. Disabling the auto unlock feature can be useful in
certain situations where your phone will be in close proximity to the lock
(such as in a locker). To unlock it when auto unlock is enabled, just click a
button on the app or use the trademark Quick-Click feature.</p>

just wait for it to connect automatically to the lock using Bluetooth 4.0

It’s just that easy. 
Operating your NathLock is even easier:

Press
the shackle to wake NathLock up
It
searches for your phone, and if it’s within a few feet, it opens automatically

There’s no app to launch, no key to bring, and no need to take your
phone out of your pocket. 
For your convenience, we’ve fitted NathLock with a series of advanced
features to make it by far the best lock on the market.

When you need to share NathLock and grant someone else access, the included
app for iOS, Android, and Windows phone allows you to send either, one-time or
multi-use keys. That way when you’re away, you can allow someone access, but on
your terms. 
See Who’s Using It, and When
When you need to monitor access to sensitive documents, especially in an
office, NathLock can give you detailed information about who opened a lock, and
when. It’s available via the ‘History’ section of the included app.

An Advanced & Beautiful Design
Built from 30 interlocking components, NathLock was created to be:

Beautiful
Resilient
Water
Resistant
Long-Lasting
Secure

Beautiful
With attention to detail for aesthetics, we built NathLock to be the same
size as a standard padlock, but with soft curves and an in-line bevel to give
it a streamlined look that fits in at any location. 

Resilient
Forged from hardened steel and boron, we built NathLock to withstand even
the most extreme conditions and cunning criminals. With included anti-shim
technology, nothing gets past Nathlock. 
Water Resistant
Since NathLock can be used anywhere, we took the time to make sure no water
would ever get in. With four form-fitting grubber gaskets and a lack of
exterior buttons, NathLock is safe to use, even in rainy conditions. 
Long-Lasting
NathLock is built to last. With an included battery made to last for at
least one-year, you won’t ever be stranded. Should your battery die, we make it
easy to replace without the need for tools. 

Secure
By using industry leading Bluetooth 4.0 that utilizes 128-bit encryption,
and our very own PKI technology with cryptographic key exchange protocols,
NathLock is safe from criminals, hackers, and thieves. 
A Battery Built to Last
To remove worry about when your battery will die, NathLock is set up so that
you receive notifications to your phone well before the battery is going to
die. When you need to replace the battery, we made it simple so you don’t have
to stress. Just unlock NathLock and unscrew the back. The battery will easily
pop out and allow you to replace it with another. 

What if the battery dies completely? It’s unlikely, but should it happen you
can “jump start” NathLock by pressing a replacement battery against the contact
points (see pictures for details) which will allow you to unlock NathLock and
replace the battery. There are no wires to mess with, no exposed ports to ruin
your lock, and best of all, no expensive batteries. It costs as much as a pair
of AA’s. 
How We Developed Nathlock
When we researched Nathlock, we looked at the best locks on the market,
deconstructed them, and found out where they were vulnerable, and what parts
weren’t. We used this information to craft the most secure and advanced padlock
in the world. It was challenging, and at times seemingly impossible, but we did
it all to give the world what it needed: a lock that’s simple enough for a
child to use, but able to thwart even the best thieves and criminals. 

The Timeline for Nathlock’s Development
Since we have already spent the time researching, developing, testing, and
retesting the design, hardware, software, and even the firmware, we are finally
gearing up for world stage release. We have chosen a leading manufacturer to
build NathLock, but rest assured, we will keep improving Nathlock as necessary
for its public release. Anyone luckily enough to receive one as a beta will
subject NathLock to unimaginable conditions to ensure that our lock is
second-to-none. Once it’s perfect to our exacting standards, mass-production
will begin and Nathlock will be ready for delivery. As part of the launch and on a limited time offer only, we’re offering a very limited gold edition of the NathLock Padlock. Join us on our journey.Mix and Match: Choose from Three interface Ring ColorsBlack, Blue, or White

The Risks and Challenges
As former product developers for successful companies, we are intimately
acquainted with what it takes to deliver a superior product on a firm delivery
schedule. For the past several months, we have been working tirelessly to not
only design, but also refine and test our product so that it is absolutely
perfect for the consumer market. But rest assured, the photos and video you see
are of the finished product. 
So what are the risks? With every product comes the risk that manufacturing,
packaging, or even shipping could delay the product launch. For a successful
launch, all components must work perfectly and sadly, some of these aspects are
out of our control. 
However, because we have an established working relationship with the
manufacturer, and given our intimate knowledge of the design process, we should
be able to quickly resolve any issues as they arise. But regardless of delays
or on time delivery schedules, we will keep you informed at each and every
step. 
Learn more about our accountability through our website.

What happens if the battery dies while NathLock is locked?
While a rare occurrence since the NathLock app shows you the battery level
every time you use it and we give you a warning several months before the
battery dies, it is still theoretically possible. Should this happen, we have
included the ability to ""jump-start"" your NathLock with an external
battery. Simply place the battery to the contact leads (per the operating
manual) to allow you to unlock the NathLock. You can then open the back and
replace the battery.
How secure is Bluetooth?
Because NathLock uses the industry standard Bluetooth 4.0, it offers the
highest level of security available from a Bluetooth device. Bluetooth 4.0 uses
the 128-bit AES CCM encryption algorithm, which ensures that all transmissions
are encrypted and secure. Bluetooth 4.0 devices are significantly more secure
than older Bluetooth devices.
Does NathLock add any encryption to standard Bluetooth encryption?
Yes, in addition to the standard Bluetooth encryption, we gave NathLock the
latest in PKI technology and a cryptographic key exchange protocol to help keep
all communications with your NathLock device secure.
What type of battery does NathLock use?
While the final battery selection will occur over the next couple months, we
do know that it will be a standard watch battery that is not only easy to find
but is also inexpensive. 
How secure is NathLock?
NathLock has several security features built in to help it become among the
most secure products available on the market. In the pursuit of security, from
both criminals and the elements, we have incorporated:

Bluetooth
4.0
Water
Resistance
An
Impervious Design

Bluetooth: Nathlock uses the industry standard Bluetooth 4.0 with a 128 bit
AES CCM encryption algorithm so all transmissions are not only secure, but also
encrypted. 
Water Resistance: Because you can’t control the weather, we made NathLock
water resistant so you can use it anywhere worry free. 
Impervious Design: To make it virtually impossible for thieves to steal the
NathLock, we built it out of hardened boron and even included anti-shim
technology. 
Can I disable the auto-unlock feature?
Absolutely. To disable this feature, simply log into the app and select it
as the default setting. Disabling the auto unlock feature can be useful in
certain situations where your phone will be in close proximity to the lock
(such as in a locker). To unlock it when auto unlock is enabled, just click a
button on the app or use the trademark Quick-Click feature.
What are the specifications (length, thickness, weight) of the bike cable
and mount kit? 
The cable itself is built out of braided steel rope and is approximately 6ft
(2m) long, 10mm thick, and weights 450 grams (about one pound). The mount only
adds a couple of ounces to your total bike weight, and won’t be noticeable when
you go for a ride. 
Is the App free?
Since the app is an integral and essential component to NathLock, it will be
free.

off your phone 
Disable
the Bluetooth on your phone and then use our trademark Quick-Click to open

</p><p><br/></p><br/><br/></div>","LT-Stand X 2.0 is an universal laptop stand. Its main purpose is to support a laptop and, at the same time, to provide full freedom of movement for the user and possibility to move the stand with the laptop on it around a room, appartment or house. LT-Stand X 2.0 fullfills both conditions and we can easily say that LT-Stand X 2.0 is the one trully complete laptop stand.Its main characteristics are small weight and great solidity. It can be used for laptop computers with dimensions from 10'' to 17''.
Basic
characteristics


The
upper part of the stand can be
quickly and easily adjusted for every laptop model. 


Adjustive
battens have a recesses as well
as PU pads and an adjustive nails. These elements make
laptop sit firmly on a batten (almost as it is glued).

Adjustive
nails are to insure laptop from
gliding off the stand. They are designed so you almost could not feel
them.

… at
the same time, thanks to all this, you can put the laptop on and get
it off the battens easily and fast, as it was with every other
surface.

The
wings open in width. They are
ment for mouse, but you could as well put a small notebook or another
light thing.

Teethed
holder provides different
positions of the upper part. We advice two ways of using it: “A”
(the main one), “B” (the secondary one). To adjust the incline
the key is needed (not included).

Adjusting
the hight of the stand is very easy and could be done simply by
turning of the wheel and pulling the main telescopic stand leg.Under
the wheel there is a handle that can be used to move the stand from
one place to another.

Adjusting
of the stand is to make it more stable, if you need it. And can be
done by simple turning of the leg.

Three-point
system of the legs give the stand stability and leave the complete
freedom for your legs and feet. And it needs much less room.
ADVANTAGES
(IN COMPARISON TO THE TABLE)

Ideal
positioning

LT-Stand
is designed to make your typing easier and faster. While working on
your laptop you can comfortably sit  wherever you like: on your bed,
chair, armchair... your laptop will always be positioned ideally ,
and you will have total freedom to move your legs, feet and
arms.When you work you have a feeling of a laptop floating over
your legs.

Maximum
cooling



LT-Stand
provides super effective cooling for your laptop because it does not
clog its own cooling system and let the fresh air to circle and
naturally cool your laptop. As a result the laptop works easier and
faster, heats less and serves longer.As it does not stay at the
flat surface and is completely open from under, your laptop does not
absorb the dust and dirt from the room. 

Movable

LT-Stand
is thought so that it provides easy moving around a room, or from one
place to another. Now you can move your laptop together with the
stand wherever you like at the moment (in front of the armchair, near
TV, in the kitchen...)
Spare
the room

LT-Stand
is designed to spare maximum of your room, it looks modern, that is
why it will be easy to fit in almost every environment, it will
become invisible but functional part of your daily life.
Adjustive
hight

LT-Stand
X 2.0 provides easy adjustment of stand's hight for your laptop to be
in the best position to work on.
Sturdy
support

LT-Stand
X 2.0, despite its light weight, provides sturdy support for your
laptop (as if it was standing on the table). And this is really reare
when it comes to laptop stands.
Why
do we need your help?


LT-Stand
X 2.0 is the product we would like to be avaliable for everyone for
reasonable price.
It is made from 139 pieces, excluding packaging and accompanying
elements. The most parts cannot be made individually, but only in
series, that is why we are conditioned to make some quantities, not
just one.With your help many people will know about this amazing
LT-Stand X 2.0. Because of this we will be able to buy quality
materials for lower prices and advance production. As a result we
will have more finances left to promote our product and enlarge
production. 

PRODUCTION
PLAN


… about
production capacities



LT-Stand
X 2.0 will be produced in a private firm “s.r. BARNAK” from Stara
Pazova, Serbia.

s.r.
BARNAK is working succesfully for more than 20 years now. Among its
products are more than 250 different subjects from plastic and metal
for metal and paper industry. The greater part of products is secured
with patent. Besides this, one new part of production capacities is
ment for development and production of laptop stands.The products
by s.r. BARNAK are known for their high quality, functionality and
innovations. The firm is one of the leaders in the field.

… how
it all started 


“Once,
after many hours of working on my laptop, I have noticed pain in my
legs and back aches, and that moment was the turning point for the
idea of functional stand for laptop computer.”Zlatko Barnak

“The
first prototype of the laptop stand was very bulky and did not look
good in the terms of aesthetics. But at the same time it revealed all
the drawbacks, as well as possibilities. Unfortunatel, there is great
ammount of such a stands from other manufacturers on the market.”Zlatko Barnak
Risks
and challenges

The
model development

As
you can see on the chart above, LT-Stand X 2.0 is the last in the
series of official models and prototypes and was tested out in
different ways, that allowed us to eliminate all found drawbacks. The
last obstacle that could affect production, is the material we are to
use, because suppliers insist on exact quantities, but we believe
that we could overcome this obstacle with your help. That is why it
is extremely important for us, that as many of you as possible
participate.


By
the Serbian law we are obliged to give you 2 years warranty for our
product, so the quality of a product is guaranteed. But we propose
more than that, because we know, that quality is what we want to be
known for worldwide.

All
the models of LT-Stand will be put together by hands at s.r.BARNAK
workshop, which guarantees you a high quality of a product. We have
sold more than a hundred of previous models of stands and have the
same ammount of satisfied users. We can proudly say that for the time
being we did not have one complaint for our products. We hope that
with your help there will be much more satisfied users and proud
owners of LT-Stand X 2.0.
It's
time...

It's
just the right time to use your laptop everywhere and in every place.
It's time for you to keep it near with no fear of where to put it.
Help this idea to live, be the part of the winning team that will
provide the others such a comfort. We can do everything together. And
do not miss the opportunity to get your LT-Stand X 2.0 in much lower
price in comparison of what you would pay in a regular shop.

this project to be the person who can proudly say: “Yes, I am the
one who helped this project to live.”

We are IllumiNAUGHTY Games, a black-owned video game company that is always aiming to create thought-provoking experiences. We make software as well as hardware.

Currently, for control, a flex sensor is placed on the middle finger of the glove that detects how much it bends. Acceleromter at the top of the hand tracks the angle and speed of hand. We have a demo application where tilting your hand a certain way will either make your character fly or hover/not fly.



Something that sets Oso apart from other physical feedback controllers is that it uses more than vibration to give sensations. For physical feedback, there is a device that jerks back and forth which is great for the feeling of recoil from shooting, but it can be used for other sensations as well like strong turbulence.



The games are played on a PC with a USB connection. The games are currently made using Processing. Oso is also meant to be simple for developers to create games for it.


We envision many genres of games that could be created for Oso, from 2D platformers to first-person shooters. We also ultimately envision a ""suit,"" consisting of pieces that can work independently or together. However, right now, we are focusing on ""perfecting"" our current glove.

We want to advance the prototype we have now, and we need your help. For the next phase of Oso, we want to:

1. Add vibration,
2. Add ability to track bend of all 5 fingers.
3. Make it wireless.
4. Create an API for developers.

The money will also help us design it to be more durable as well as enhance its appearance.

    The Impact
The future of the gaming industry is realistic motion control and realistic physical feedback. It goes perfectly with the current rise of virtual reality.

“Oso“ is a Yoruba word meaning “wizard“ or “sorcerer.” Yoruba is a Nigerian-Afrikan language. 


The logo is in the form of an Afrikan mask. In many traditional Afrikan cultures, masks represent a particular spirit that is embodied by the person wearing it. It epitomizes the idea of playing a “character.”
We chose to draw heavily on Afrika for Oso’s branding because of the lack of an Afrikan presence in the game (development) industry. 
There is currently a demand for Afrikan-American game developers in the US because game consumers and players are disproportionately Afrikan-American.
There has also been a movement involving people of Afrikan descent, specifically Afrikan-Americans, learning more about their heritage, including history and language. I wanted to create a brand that forced people to say Afrikan words and be aware of Afrikan culture.

Not only do we aim to create a mystical gaming experience, we also want to encourage the rise of a more diverse group of developers, specifically those of Afrikan descent.

    Risks & Challenges
As mentioned previously, Oso is in the early prototyping phase. In essence, we are still experimenting with how to accomplish our ultimate goal, so our methods may change although the core concept remains the same.

We are very dedicated, intelligent, and passionate people who have overcome many obstacles to get this far in our company. This project is a dream come true to work on. We are mostly just having fun, but we hope and believe we can create a gaming experience truly unique and magical.

COLORIedizione esclusiva CoverChute è realizzato al 100% in materiale antiurto proveniente dalle migliori ricerche italiane in nanotecnologie. È un innovativo termo plastica / gomma composto che differisce notevolmente da tutti gli elastomeri convenzionali. Come un assorbitore, CaseChute assorbe gli urti temporaneamente deformandosi e convertendo il 97% dell'energia generata dall'impatto in calore. Il calore viene quindi dissipato immediatamente nell'aria e di conseguenza meno del 3% dell'energia shock viene trasferito allo smartphone.  In una gamma di temperature da -20 ° C a + 35 ° C, CaseChute è il materiale più performante esistente sul mercato.As an incredibly thin, protective case, Limitless only adds ~2mm to the thickness of your iPhone.

Questo materiale è lo stesso usato per le prove pilota del MotoGP per difendere il corpo dalle cadute possibili durante una gara.La sfida è stata trasferire la sua nanotecnologia ad un caso di smartphone e il nostro obiettivo è stato quello di assorbire e dissipare l'energia della caduta.Alla fine lo abbiamo fatto e ora siamo pronti a far sì che il mio sogno diventi realtà. Dopo più di 100 test di cadute da ogni angolo da un'altezza di 2 m, gli iPhone 6 e 7 utilizzati non erano affatto danneggiati e continuavano a lavorare.

The GAN  era has arrived.  Fast charge every device you have no matter which fast-charging protocols you need -- PD3.0 (with Programmable Power Supply), Apple 2.4A, Samsung Adaptive Fast Charge, Huawei SuperCharge/ FCP/ MediaTek Pump Express, Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 / 3.0 ...    Here’s a by no means definitive list of the devices that Powmini will power-up:  Macbook, Dell, Samsung, Razor, Huawei, HP, Lenovo,  ASUS, Acer, TOSHIBA, Microsoft surface book.  *Compatibility is subjected to the model and software version of laptops. Upgrade of software upgrade may affect the compatibility. However, it doesn't mean that the laptops not listed above is not supported.       You can use up all 3 ports when all your devices’ batteries are running low.        There’s no taking chances with electricity, wherever you are in the world. Powmini has a smart chip that ensures the stability of power flow to each device.    No screen jump, no splash screen, no battery damage ,smart chip, support Android system, support iP system  90 degree Foldable prongs.     *Traveling to other countries and wondering if you can take this charger along? No worries, we got you covered. Our charger is usable worldwide!Global voltage (100-240V)Worldwide adapter availableSupport all USB-C    Powmini has been years in the making.  The result of hours and hours of dedication to create the slimmest, sleekest charged out there. Now you can buy a charger that matches your devices in terms of how technologically advanced it is.          Powmini has been developed and tested by a team who share a common goal – wanting to bring more ease and more convenience to more people’s lives. Like you, we’ve all had to put up with carrying around many bulky chargers for our devices for too long, simply because there’s been no alternative. Well, now we’ve developed the alternative, and our bags are lighter, our charging more efficient and our lives that little bit easier. Yours could be too.     GaN Electrical Performance Test    We include a free converter  for every charger backed according to the shipping country, currently our charges is using US plug by default. If your shipping address is outside the United States, we will give you one FREE converter according to your region.",46.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><h1>Why #PowerOurPlanet?</h1>
<p>Why do people go to the gym? It's because they're motivated. Whether it's to impress a girl/guy, get in shape, or to look great on the beach this summer, motivated people do incredible things. I am #MotivatedByMotivation, it inspires me. From this inspiration, we developed a new way to power our planet. A way that utilizes the most infinite resource known to man: Human Motivation! <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The #PowerOurPlanet fitness system will change the world as we know it. No other piece of equipment on the market offers you the opportunity to independently produce enough electricity to power your whole home while receiving the benefits of a quality workout.</span><br/></p>
<p>The workout equipment we are engineering is infused with our turbine integrated resistance technology, unique when compared to its competitors. In order to connect the equipment to the grid you would need a grid-tie-inverter (carried by most hardware chains, but will be included in the retail package. We are also developing portable storage pods to take your electricity with you on the go. For in house use the #PowerOurPlanet fitness system will not be very costly and with consistent use, will pay for itself in just a few months of free electricity. You wouldn’t have to pay health club memberships and you would potentially earn money from a negative meter read. </p>
<p><i>Donate to fund the cost of developing a patent and prototype of a new product!</i></p>
<p>Our system is more efficient, effective, and environmentally sound than any other method of producing electricity. Energy produced by our system is 100% renewable, and is produced in the safest most efficient method. It can also provide low cost electricity for impoverished families, and a safe method to bring power to the remote regions of the world. </p>
<p>Using our fitness system is also key to the user’s well being --  it can lower the rate of obesity and complications caused from obesity, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. It also gives the user motivation to exercise regularly without having to purchase a costly membership at a gym! </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to create and popularize technology that will revolutionize the health/ fitness industry as well as the way we think about our energy bills. We are currently working with a patent attorney to get this done. This can cost us anywhere between <b>$8,000-$16,000</b>. Failure to file the correct claims could lead to copyright/patent infringement, so this step must be completed by a registered patent attorney.</p>
<p>Your funding can help us secure the correct patents so we can begin to manufacture our machines. After all that is accomplished, we can begin to deliver machines to our high level backers so they can get first dibs on producing their own electricity as they stay in shape. We will also open a #PowerOurPlanet gym facility with free membership and perks.  </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help:</b></p>
<p>If you aren’t able to donate at this time, you can still help support our cause! Please share our campaign with everyone you know, via social media, email, and word of mouth.  Join our cause. Let's make this a part of our reality. Together, we have the power the change the world!</p>

<p>The #PowerOurPlanet fitness system will be available for home use, but we will create a free gym where members can come to get motivated and #PowerOurPlanet with the power of human motivation. During workouts we produce kinetic energy. Turbines will convert that kinetic energy into electrical energy. The turbine integrated resistance technology we created uses the force created by your motion during exercise to power the turbine. Each turbine will add resistance to your workout that will be consistent with the resistance added by free weights or pulley resistance systems commonly used in today's work out equipment.</p>The workout equipment we are engineering is infused with our turbine integrated resistance technology, unique when compared to its competitors that waste kinetic energy.  In order to connect the equipment to the grid you would need a grid-tie-inverter (carried by most hardware chains), but will be included in the retail package. We are also developing portable storage pods that will be charged by our equipment, so you can take your electricity with you on the go. For in house use the #PowerOurPlanet fitness system will not be very costly and with consistent use, will pay for itself in just a few months of free electricity. You wouldn’t have to pay health club memberships and you would potentially earn money from a negative meter read.  Similar technology is being used by resort tour bus companies for cycling tours in which a hybrid tour bus is powered by the cycling passengers. Whether in your home or at our gyms, now is our time to #PowerOurPlanet with this technology.<p></p>
</div><h2>The Reason For Our Campaign</h2><h4>Our goal is to popularize technology that will revolutionize the health/ fitness industry as well as the way we think about solving environmental problems around our planet. We would love to, but at this time are unable to provide any prototypes that will display our design/functionality specifics due to the lack of a patent or the funds to obtain one. Be on the lookout for updates as we near the end of our campaign. <span style="""">Take a stand with us and help us to make this thing HAPPEN NOW!</span>

<li>We've been working with Celeste Stevenson of Patent Services USA. They really love our concept and are doing everything in their power to help us obtain our patents by connecting us to their affiliate patent attorneys and getting us the best price possible for their services. The patent attorney has experience in engineering as well as patent laws and will ensure that our designs do not infringe upon any existing patents by searching through 30 years of patent history. This is the most costly part of the process. The attorney can and will charge anywhere between $8,000-$16,000 to complete this process.

<p>P.S. Please leave comments. We would love to know your thoughts!</p>
<p></p>
</div></div>","Are you ‪#‎motivatedbymotivation‬? Indie artist Stanford Reid invented a way to convert human motivation into free electricity to ‪#‎PowerOurPlanet‬! 
Why #PowerOurPlanet?
Why do people go to the gym? It's because they're motivated. Whether it's to impress a girl/guy, get in shape, or to look great on the beach this summer, motivated people do incredible things. I am #MotivatedByMotivation, it inspires me. From this inspiration, we developed a new way to power our planet. A way that utilizes the most infinite resource known to man: Human Motivation!  

The #PowerOurPlanet fitness system will change the world as we know it. No other piece of equipment on the market offers you the opportunity to independently produce enough electricity to power your whole home while receiving the benefits of a quality workout.
The workout equipment we are engineering is infused with our turbine integrated resistance technology, unique when compared to its competitors. In order to connect the equipment to the grid you would need a grid-tie-inverter (carried by most hardware chains, but will be included in the retail package. We are also developing portable storage pods to take your electricity with you on the go. For in house use the #PowerOurPlanet fitness system will not be very costly and with consistent use, will pay for itself in just a few months of free electricity. You wouldn’t have to pay health club memberships and you would potentially earn money from a negative meter read. 
Donate to fund the cost of developing a patent and prototype of a new product!
Our system is more efficient, effective, and environmentally sound than any other method of producing electricity. Energy produced by our system is 100% renewable, and is produced in the safest most efficient method. It can also provide low cost electricity for impoverished families, and a safe method to bring power to the remote regions of the world. 
Using our fitness system is also key to the user’s well being --  it can lower the rate of obesity and complications caused from obesity, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. It also gives the user motivation to exercise regularly without having to purchase a costly membership at a gym! 
What We Need & What You Get:
Our goal is to create and popularize technology that will revolutionize the health/ fitness industry as well as the way we think about our energy bills. We are currently working with a patent attorney to get this done. This can cost us anywhere between $8,000-$16,000. Failure to file the correct claims could lead to copyright/patent infringement, so this step must be completed by a registered patent attorney.
Your funding can help us secure the correct patents so we can begin to manufacture our machines. After all that is accomplished, we can begin to deliver machines to our high level backers so they can get first dibs on producing their own electricity as they stay in shape. We will also open a #PowerOurPlanet gym facility with free membership and perks.  
Other Ways You Can Help:
If you aren’t able to donate at this time, you can still help support our cause! Please share our campaign with everyone you know, via social media, email, and word of mouth.  Join our cause. Let's make this a part of our reality. Together, we have the power the change the world!

The #PowerOurPlanet fitness system will be available for home use, but we will create a free gym where members can come to get motivated and #PowerOurPlanet with the power of human motivation. During workouts we produce kinetic energy. Turbines will convert that kinetic energy into electrical energy. The turbine integrated resistance technology we created uses the force created by your motion during exercise to power the turbine. Each turbine will add resistance to your workout that will be consistent with the resistance added by free weights or pulley resistance systems commonly used in today's work out equipment.The workout equipment we are engineering is infused with our turbine integrated resistance technology, unique when compared to its competitors that waste kinetic energy.  In order to connect the equipment to the grid you would need a grid-tie-inverter (carried by most hardware chains), but will be included in the retail package. We are also developing portable storage pods that will be charged by our equipment, so you can take your electricity with you on the go. For in house use the #PowerOurPlanet fitness system will not be very costly and with consistent use, will pay for itself in just a few months of free electricity. You wouldn’t have to pay health club memberships and you would potentially earn money from a negative meter read.  Similar technology is being used by resort tour bus companies for cycling tours in which a hybrid tour bus is powered by the cycling passengers. Whether in your home or at our gyms, now is our time to #PowerOurPlanet with this technology.
The Reason For Our CampaignOur goal is to popularize technology that will revolutionize the health/ fitness industry as well as the way we think about solving environmental problems around our planet. We would love to, but at this time are unable to provide any prototypes that will display our design/functionality specifics due to the lack of a patent or the funds to obtain one. Be on the lookout for updates as we near the end of our campaign. Take a stand with us and help us to make this thing HAPPEN NOW!

More efficient, effective, and environmentally sound than any other alternative method of producing electricity.- Solar panels are currently the best, but the take up space and flat surface area.- Hydro- electricity only works if you have a steady current and is not as efficient.- Wind electricity only works in regions with consistent heavy winds.                       - Fossil fuels, when extracted, create huge underground cavities (long term effects are  theoretically negative), when burned they damage the ozone layer, and the are not a renewable energy source.                                                                       - Nuclear power is dangerous and environmentally devastating.

Energy produced by our system is 100% renewable, and is produced in the safest and most efficient method.
Can provide the electricity and funding for worldwide water purification and irrigation.
Reduces our dependency on fossil fuels and nuclear power.
Can provide the electricity to desalinate ocean water and fend against California's water problem and the many other drought problems around the world.
Provides an incentive to stay in shape.
Lower the rate of obesity and complications caused by being obese (diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease).
Provides low cost electricity for impoverished families, and a safe method to bring power to the remote regions of the world.
Provides a better economy to open small businesses, and creates jobs and ways to generate income.
Provides an incentive to drive hybrid and electric vehicles.
Longterm and short-term socio-economical benefits.
How will we go from a successfully backed campaign to a finished product and delivered perks?
We've been working with Celeste Stevenson of Patent Services USA. They really love our concept and are doing everything in their power to help us obtain our patents by connecting us to their affiliate patent attorneys and getting us the best price possible for their services. The patent attorney has experience in engineering as well as patent laws and will ensure that our designs do not infringe upon any existing patents by searching through 30 years of patent history. This is the most costly part of the process. The attorney can and will charge anywhere between $8,000-$16,000 to complete this process. Failure to file the correct claims could lead to copyright/patent infringement, so this step must be completed by a registered patent attorney.
Once we secure the correct patents or at least have them pending. we can legally begin to manufacture our machines. We can also license other manufacturers to use our patents. 
We can begin to deliver machines to our high level backers so they can get first dibs on producing their own electricity as they stay in shape. 
Goals
Have our patent pending or approved by January 2016
Manufacture our first line our #PowerOurPlanet fitness systems by February 2016.
Donate several of the first models to community centers and YMCA's in impoverished areas.
Open a free health club with all free services for members to produce electricity for everyone. Health club would have a free Spa, yoga classes, and fitness instructors and it could all be funded by the revenue generated from the energy the members produce.

Risks & ChallengesI'am committed to bringing you a great product, and won't settle for anything less. Thus, during the manufacturing stage, I will actively work with the factory to make sure that everything is up to our standards. I recognize that this might result in a delay in my manufacturing process if complications arise, and I find it very important to make sure that these are shipped in a timely matter, but i will prioritize quality. Rest assured i will notify everyone of what's going on so there will be no surprises.

Chimara. Smart & Easy Investing. For everyone.



Many of us are aware that sophisticated investment strategies and outstanding performance profits are in general only available to people with higher net values and professional investors.
This is about to change!We are Chimara
We are a multiprofessional team of financial experts, highly motivated and all in passion for financial markets. We think different. We act different. We make the difference!
And we are on a mission!
Introducing:
THE NEXT GENERATION OF INVESTING Chimara. Smart & Easy Investing. For Everyone.

We believe that everyone deserves access to sophisticated investment strategies and outstanding performance potentials. No matter what level of wealth.Chimara is making this a reality!Our vision is to democratise investmentsWe want to expand worldwide and make Smart & Easy Investing available and accessible for everyone!


                                                          A revolutionary investment programChimara will set up a multifunctional investment platform and a convenient smart phone application on which active members, even with small amounts of money, will have the ability to invest and to participate in sophisticated investment strategies and outstanding performance profits.                                                                                                                                           Performance EngineChimara has developed a smart performance engine. The performance engine is based on a mathematical algorithm that operates exclusively within the high liquid major markets, mainly focusing on commodity and currency markets.
One of the key characteristics of the engine is that it continuously searches the entire market space for relevant information and activities. The engine then evaluates the prevailing technical environment and market behavior using a mathematical algorithm that calculates the corresponding profit potentials factoring all information. This methodology enables the performance engine to identify and capture moving markets at a very early stage and to  create superior performance profits. The Investment Objective & Strategy

The investment objective of Chimara is to achieve high absolute returns (independent of any market directions) by exploiting short and medium term market developments in rising (long buying) as well as in declining (short selling) market situations. Chimara’s investment strategy is operated by Chimara's smart performance engine. Chimara operates risk averse. Chimara has established strict risk control parameters which allow the performance engine to take advantage of extensive profit potentials. Performance is made by chaining up precalculated positions. This creates stability and consistency.

<div>Stop buying so many phone cases! This case is all about you. What you do each day changes and so should your phone case. This case is a unique platform that allows you to customize and accesorize it however you want, as many times as you want. Using a special locking stem system, you securely attach and remove any item to the case as many times as you want. Make your own attachments with our tape we provide or get some from our online store. Try and you will be amazed! No more need to have dozen of cases anymore...this case can do it all!</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456503273/thtdatp0vmcwumlu7qkf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<h3>The Product</h3>
<div>What is our unique phone case you may ask? In short: it is a customizable phone case that the user can attach and change various items to fit their daily situation or needs. Make your own attachments using our locking stem tape or use some of the ones we offer. There is no other phone case on the market like ours. It's functional, durable, and will save you money.</div>

<p>The cases are made of a rubberized plastic called TPU and makes for great feel, grip, and impact absorption (I've dropped mine at least a dozen times in this case with no damage). </p>
<p></p>

<p>The case encompasses all sides completely with covers over buttons and holes for access to the ports, speaker, and switch. The case is very easy to put on and off yet holds very securly.</p>

<p>Attachments easily lock onto this case using the special locking stem system. You can create your own attachments with the piece of locking stem tape we send you...or buy some attachments from our store. You can take many common mobile phone items on the market and use them with this case by applying the tape.</p>

<p>Adding attachments is a snap with a simple press and removing attachments just require a gentle tug. The holding power is directly related to the size of the contact area of the locking stems, so a larger patch of locking stem will hold much stronger than a small section will.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZnvYMej1P68%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZnvYMej1P68%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZnvYMej1P68%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>The case will last a long time and easy to care for (the black case shown in this campaign is a final prototype that has been used everyday for 6 months). If dirt accumulates on the face then simply taking the case off the phone and giving it a wash and scrub with a hard bristle brush will return it to new.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>The Situation</h3>
<p>After prototyping the case we found a manufacturer that can supply the cases to us that was close enough to my concept. We ordered initial patches of cases for iPhone 5, 6, and 6+. We opened a Shopify store at <a href=""http://www.mytudecases.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mytudecases.com</a> and opened social media accounts. The initial batches are focused towards the creative users with bright colors, and attachments more appealing to artistic interests. We placed the first batches on the market and they have received large amount of attention from users around the world. <br/></p>
<p>We spent a large amount of money to get the first batch designed and manufactured. As we started marketing these cases we realized that there was an even larger demand for functional use by working adults.  It is time to manufacture a large batch of our unique one-of-a -kind locking stem cases for iPhone 5, 6, and 6+ in the color black and white from our manufacturer to appeal to the functional working adult. Our funds are still tied up in the last production so that is why we are conducting a funding campaign. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>To reach the market we need your help. We need:</p>
<p><b>Minimum $10,000 Goal:</b></p>
<p>With these funds we will accomplish the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$6000 - </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">purchase a batch</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of black Agent X iPhone 5, 6, and 6+ cases from our manufacturer for use with functional attachments</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$3000 - design and <b>manufacture</b></span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> functional attachments</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> for the cases</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$1000 - legal, administrative, and marketing costs</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Stretch Goals-</b></p>
<p><b>Over $10,000 Goal:</b></p>
<p>If we receive additional funds we will just go bigger! Purchase more colors and develop more attachments. But even better we can get some cases made for Samsung and iPads! YAY! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Over $100,000 Goal:</b></p>
<p>If we receive additional funds over $100,000 we can start to get real! Our cases are not exactly how we need them. With this money we can have new molds made, which is really expensive. We can address the edge height and add our logo to the cases. This will get us in the big leagues. We will also set up a drop-shipment service in Europe to reduce shipping fees to this area. This will increase our sales.</p>
<p><b>Over $200,000 Goal:</b></p>
<p>If we receive additional funds over $200,000 not only can we get real, but do it in different areas. Not only can we get new molds for iPhone, but now we can get new molds for Samsung phone cases.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
It starts with a giant THANK YOU! But from there you can get either the new black cases or the current colored cases. You can advance even further with a case and some discounts. Or level up and receive several cases with a extended supply of attachments. Big climb to the top and get all our new cases and attachments for 1 year before we release them on our store! If we get enough funding we can even add functional attachments for you. That's cool! </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your support and contribution will allow us to do what we can't do...go all the way. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risk: No one buys our cases :-(</p>

<h3>Commonly Asked Questions</h3>
<p>Q: Does this use Velcro? Does this use a magnet?</p>
<p>A: NO! It uses something way better! We use a industrial grade locking stem tape that is 100 times better than Velcro and 300 times better than a magnet. It holds tight and is not furry or sticky.</p>
<p>Q: Is the locking stem system your design?</p>
<p>A: NO! The locking stem tape is not our intellectual property. It is made by an adhesive company and is available to anyone. We just happened to be the first to use it on a phone case.</p>
<p>Q: How durable is it?</p>
<p>A: The cases are very durable. The black iPhone 6+ case in the project is one of the final prototypes and the very case I use everyday personally. I have been using it for over 6 months and it is still in great shape.</p>
<p>Q: How strong does it hold?</p>
<p>A: It depends. It can hold very weak to super strong. It depends on the contact area. When the contact size area is that of a quarter coin, it holds very good yet is easy to pull off. If the contact area is that of a dollar bill, then it would hold extremely strong, but would require a very large amount of pulling force to get off.</p>
Q: Is production guaranteed?</div><div>A: YES! We have already ordered 600 cases from the manufacturer in the past so production will happen once enough funds are received. </div><div>Q: What model cases do you carry?</div><div>A: Right now we carry cases that fit iPhone 5/5c/5s, iPhone 6/6s, &amp; iPhone 6+/6+s. If we get enough funds we will start carrying some Samsung cases as well as cases for iPad.</div></div>","The Project - Agent X line of cases
Stop buying so many phone cases! This case is all about you. What you do each day changes and so should your phone case. This case is a unique platform that allows you to customize and accesorize it however you want, as many times as you want. Using a special locking stem system, you securely attach and remove any item to the case as many times as you want. Make your own attachments with our tape we provide or get some from our online store. Try and you will be amazed! No more need to have dozen of cases anymore...this case can do it all!

The Product
What is our unique phone case you may ask? In short: it is a customizable phone case that the user can attach and change various items to fit their daily situation or needs. Make your own attachments using our locking stem tape or use some of the ones we offer. There is no other phone case on the market like ours. It's functional, durable, and will save you money.



The cases are made of a rubberized plastic called TPU and makes for great feel, grip, and impact absorption (I've dropped mine at least a dozen times in this case with no damage). 


The case encompasses all sides completely with covers over buttons and holes for access to the ports, speaker, and switch. The case is very easy to put on and off yet holds very securly.




Attachments easily lock onto this case using the special locking stem system. You can create your own attachments with the piece of locking stem tape we send you...or buy some attachments from our store. You can take many common mobile phone items on the market and use them with this case by applying the tape.

Adding attachments is a snap with a simple press and removing attachments just require a gentle tug. The holding power is directly related to the size of the contact area of the locking stems, so a larger patch of locking stem will hold much stronger than a small section will.

The case will last a long time and easy to care for (the black case shown in this campaign is a final prototype that has been used everyday for 6 months). If dirt accumulates on the face then simply taking the case off the phone and giving it a wash and scrub with a hard bristle brush will return it to new.

                                                   
Note: The locking stem technology is not our intellectual property. It is purchased from a commercial source and added at time of manufacture of the case.


Our Current Line
Currently on our online store at www.mytudecases.com we offer a creative line of Mytude cases. These cases have become real popular and they have been shipped to a dozen countries so far. 


The users love the look and versatility of the design for use with the decorative attachments. The Mytude Cases have been a big hit with the younger generation and has received numerous positive reviews by fans on social media.



Note: The locking stem technology is not our intellectual property. It is purchased from a commercial source and added at time of manufacture of the case.

The Situation
After prototyping the case we found a manufacturer that can supply the cases to us that was close enough to my concept. We ordered initial patches of cases for iPhone 5, 6, and 6+. We opened a Shopify store at www.mytudecases.com and opened social media accounts. The initial batches are focused towards the creative users with bright colors, and attachments more appealing to artistic interests. We placed the first batches on the market and they have received large amount of attention from users around the world. 
We spent a large amount of money to get the first batch designed and manufactured. As we started marketing these cases we realized that there was an even larger demand for functional use by working adults.  It is time to manufacture a large batch of our unique one-of-a -kind locking stem cases for iPhone 5, 6, and 6+ in the color black and white from our manufacturer to appeal to the functional working adult. Our funds are still tied up in the last production so that is why we are conducting a funding campaign.    What We Need To reach the market we need your help. We need:
Minimum $10,000 Goal:
With these funds we will accomplish the following:



$6000 - purchase a batch of black Agent X iPhone 5, 6, and 6+ cases from our manufacturer for use with functional attachments


$3000 - design and manufacture functional attachments for the cases


$1000 - legal, administrative, and marketing costs


Stretch Goals-
Over $10,000 Goal:
If we receive additional funds we will just go bigger! Purchase more colors and develop more attachments. But even better we can get some cases made for Samsung and iPads! YAY! 

Over $100,000 Goal:
If we receive additional funds over $100,000 we can start to get real! Our cases are not exactly how we need them. With this money we can have new molds made, which is really expensive. We can address the edge height and add our logo to the cases. This will get us in the big leagues. We will also set up a drop-shipment service in Europe to reduce shipping fees to this area. This will increase our sales.
Over $200,000 Goal:
If we receive additional funds over $200,000 not only can we get real, but do it in different areas. Not only can we get new molds for iPhone, but now we can get new molds for Samsung phone cases.

What You Get
It starts with a giant THANK YOU! But from there you can get either the new black cases or the current colored cases. You can advance even further with a case and some discounts. Or level up and receive several cases with a extended supply of attachments. Big climb to the top and get all our new cases and attachments for 1 year before we release them on our store! If we get enough funding we can even add functional attachments for you. That's cool!   The Impact Your support and contribution will allow us to do what we can't do...go all the way. 

Risks & Challenges
Risk: No one buys our cases :-(
That is really the only risk for us. 
For those that donate there is no risk. 
We have a proven product, a reliable and fast manufacture, and we can receive products at a reasonable price. Regardless of what happens over time, we will have the product to get to you. Some of the long term perks may have risk, but we would reimburse on a case-by-case situation.

</div>
<div><b>Is THE CUBE the only product from White Liaison?</b></div>
<div>It is for now, but we can assure you that more innovative and revolutionary products will come in the future!</div>
<div><b>Why do you guys decided on creating THE CUBE?</b></div>
<div>We feel that we miss out important notifications, more than we would like to admit. Sound from our phone is sometimes too distracting, especially during exam week, and vibration from smart band or smart watch annoyed us during working time and night time. At the end of the day, we wanted to create something that will catch our attention but will not annoy us so easily, therefore, behold, it is THE CUBE!</div>
<div><b>What is the benefit of having THE CUBE?</b></div>
<div>It is portable, easy to use and you won't miss on any notifications any more! THE CUBE will not be as annoying as the sound of your phone calls, and your vibrating smart band, especially during exam week or working days, because it will visually catch your attention!</div>
<div><b>I think 10 X 10 X 10 cm is still too big to be considered as portable. Smart band and smart watch are way more portable.</b></div>
<div>Yes, it is true that smart band or smart watch are way more portable, since they are wearable. However, THE CUBE offers you something that these devices do not offer, visually grabbing your attention when you receive any notifications via your phone! Smart band or smart watch will only vibrate or make a sound, and will stop few seconds after. THE CUBE will stay lit up even after you receive the notification 30 minutes ago, and it will turn off after you acknowledge that you receive that particular notification. </div>
<div><b>Isn't it too expensive for something so small?</b></div>
<div>It is actually relatively cheaper than smart bands/smart watches out in the world! Can you imagine days without having to constantly check your phone for an important e-mail, leaving it on your desk, and completely forgot about it until few days later?! Paying $99 just to keep in touch with your social media and notifications is an agreeable price to avoid any disaster.</div>
<div><b>So, I backed THE CUBE, what's next?</b></div>

It is for now, but we can assure you that more innovative and revolutionary products will come in the future!
Why do you guys decided on creating THE CUBE?
We feel that we miss out important notifications, more than we would like to admit. Sound from our phone is sometimes too distracting, especially during exam week, and vibration from smart band or smart watch annoyed us during working time and night time. At the end of the day, we wanted to create something that will catch our attention but will not annoy us so easily, therefore, behold, it is THE CUBE!
What is the benefit of having THE CUBE?
It is portable, easy to use and you won't miss on any notifications any more! THE CUBE will not be as annoying as the sound of your phone calls, and your vibrating smart band, especially during exam week or working days, because it will visually catch your attention!
I think 10 X 10 X 10 cm is still too big to be considered as portable. Smart band and smart watch are way more portable.
Yes, it is true that smart band or smart watch are way more portable, since they are wearable. However, THE CUBE offers you something that these devices do not offer, visually grabbing your attention when you receive any notifications via your phone! Smart band or smart watch will only vibrate or make a sound, and will stop few seconds after. THE CUBE will stay lit up even after you receive the notification 30 minutes ago, and it will turn off after you acknowledge that you receive that particular notification. 
Isn't it too expensive for something so small?
It is actually relatively cheaper than smart bands/smart watches out in the world! Can you imagine days without having to constantly check your phone for an important e-mail, leaving it on your desk, and completely forgot about it until few days later?! Paying $99 just to keep in touch with your social media and notifications is an agreeable price to avoid any disaster.
So, I backed THE CUBE, what's next?

</h3>
<p>This is so very true. I personally needed this program and searched for something simple, and complete. I could not find it, so, by accident, I came upon the solution and have benefited from it since January 22 of this year(2016).</p>
<p><b>FAMLi</b> is a blend between a Spreadsheet, word processor and Database. It was shown to some friends and clients, after which it developed it into something much larger than anticipated.</p>
<p><b>You see, everyone has the same digital issue...</b> lost data, hard to find data, too many programs to have to keep open, and the list goes on.  We need to get to documents, files, folders, programs, websites, images, PDFs, videos, emails and more. We need to access clouds, networks and all manner of places on the world wide web! All done from ONE PAGE in 2 Clicks!<br/></p>
<p></p>

<h2>What has FAMLi done for me?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have instant access to a time-line for my projects. I know what happened, when it happened and what was done about it.</li>
<li>I have NO searching to do. Literally.</li>
<li>I can update everything very fast and link to other programs that keep data related to the projects. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>FAMLi</b> has freed up so much time, that I had to buy new instruments to learn to play. (That is what I told my wife, so I need your support on this, folks!)<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465249547/SMMusic_Center362_drtae9.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 526.116px;height: 296px;""/></p>

<li>It is entertaining to open<b> FAMLi</b> and look at accounting and banking. Everything is on one page.</li>
<li>My computer runs faster since I do not need to keep all those windows open for ""convenience"".</li>
<li>I have no fear when someone asks when this or that happened. I no longer have to search, I simply ""find"".</li>

<p><b>While it is great to have the software</b> working the way it does on your home desktop... WHAT IF, you could make FAMLi portable! Take the familiarity, and that convenience, with you anywhere! <br/></p>
<p><b>Use it on any computer...anywhere, anytime, any operating system.</b> That is what they have tasked me with! </p>
<p></p>

How many of you really clicked on the run? Be honest! <br/><p></p>
<p><b>Ok, its portable, were my clients happy?</b> Sort of...they wanted everything including the FAMLi Sync! So, ok... we now Sync the  data  so everything stays aligned. What ever you plug into the FAMLi members Sync with each other. </p>
<p><b>Ok, it is Syncing now, were my clients happy?</b> Sort of...they wanted to make sure there was encryption on the devices. The portable devices are so small, perhaps they might misplace them, then what? </p>
<p><b>Ok, it is now encrypted, were my clients happy? </b>Well, sort of. You see, encryption can be broken... just like all those requests did to me:</p>

Feel right at home no matter where you need to be, and know that FAMLi will never leave any digital dust on the host computer at a friend's house, hotel or even a competitor’s office. <b>Maybe the Pentagon needs our FAMLi </b>rather than those ""always-getting-lost-laptops""! <b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>It all stays in the FAMLi.</b> (Yes, that was intentional). (Grin) Just  watch out for that printer though!! They have lots of memories, so take care of what you print. That ""cool"" selfie you took in the shower might make it onto Facebook! <br/></p>
<h3>Can We Do IT?</h3>
<p><b>Yes. It just takes time and money.</b> The time we have, the money...well...we are hoping so... with your help. All contributors will get  the FAMLi Desktop. We just want the program to be slick and meet as many needs as possible. I would not mind the encryption, and <i><b>there are many out there that do not like the cloud...I am one of those. </b></i></p>

<h2>Perks<br/>
</h2>
<p><b>This is where things get interesting.</b> The goal of FAMLi is to build a great customer base, make improvements (when practical!) and get FAMLi ready for a larger entity to take it over and grow it. <br/></p>
<p><b>There is a good business plan in place</b>. If we all participate, and polish the program as much as we can, someone will look to buy it up...happens all the time. To keep contributors loyal, we will be sharing profits with all contributors. 18% of the sales will be allocated to share in  a rebate. Spend it on another product, support another inventor, or take your better half out to dinner. </p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p><b>The way this works is to have your friends buy one copy. </b>And their friends buy one copy. The resulting sales will arouse the interest of those larger entities. You can do the math on the earnings, it is simple. Point is, you all get the program, get organised... like me... and receive something more.

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Does FAMLi come with links that work?</b><br/> / No and Yes... We link to 
the folders we made for you in the portable version, but really have no 
way to link your data for you. It is simple though.</li>
<li>
<b>How do I create links? </b><br/>/ good grief, really? Well, in our FAMLi we do
 it the same as most email programs, word processors and 
spreadsheets...highlight the word(s), click an icon, navigate to the 
file or folder. Done. 3 seconds. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Can't I make this program for myself? </b><br/>/Absolutely!!!... it took me only five years 
to figure it all out. Let me know how it goes for you! Let's talk again 
in July 2021. <br/>
</li>
<li> <b>Do I need to have FAMLi up all the time? </b><br/>/ No. And I would not 
recommend it because of potential file corruption during possible 
electrical issues. I use a keyboard shortcut to open it when needed.  
CTL+ALT+F for me. Can you guess what the F is for? No! Wrong F!<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Do I need to link everything? </b><br/>/ I don't. I link to what I use and 
need the most. My rule is 2 clicks and I am where I need to be at any time. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>How big can FAMLi get? Outlook Express has a 2G limit. </b><br/>/ You will not 
hit that limit since FAMLi is mostly Text. I am at only 900Kb at the 
moment! That is smaller than a camera picture! <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>How many versions of FAMLi are there?  </b><br/>/ Two: The FAMLi Desktop and The 
FAMLi Suite. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Do I need to be smart to use FAMLi? </b><br/>/ You will be smarter if you do! 
Truthfully, though, FAMLi has only been tested with autonomous bipedal 
life forms... I have no idea how well your FAMLi pet will do. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Can I PW Protect FAMLi? </b><br/>/ AH, shucks, we missed that one! Nah, JK... 
of course you can. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>How many copies of FAMLi can I make? </b><br/>/ How many computers do 
you want to put it on? That is how many copies you are allowed to make. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>What if I get stuck on something? </b><br/>/ FAMLi is a hybrid open source 
program that you will be familiar with. There will also be video 
tutorials that take you through everything you need to know in just 3 
minutes (or so). If that fails you, drop us an email. If that fails you,
 the assumption on our end will be that you are a quadruped, and we do 
not support them at this time. Sorry Pooch.</li>
<li>
<b>If I don't put anything into FAMLi, will it work?  </b><br/>/ Please buy a 
copy of Quick Books, install it on your computer and call their tech support. Ask that 
same question, please. They need some cheering up. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Do I need dual monitors like you have? </b><br/>/ Nope. They work on laptops 
also, but I have another portable monitor for that as well. Personally, I
 am not a single Screen Guy!  Here is an example of what I mean...keep 
in mind this was back in the day! <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465398137/DW1_zvf2cb.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 546.667px;height: 410px;cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>                                             Yeah...I know, right?<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Does FAMLi pester users to upgrade, update and renew? </b><br/>/ No, No and NO! No pestering, no nag-ware, no upgrading, no threats, no pop-ups. It is yours. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>CAN I upgrade if I want to? </b><br/>/ Yes. There will be improvements on the FAMLiSoftware.com site when they become available. There will be a description of what is new. You may not need it. More than likely, it will be Tips and Tricks sort of stuff. <br/>

This is so very true. I personally needed this program and searched for something simple, and complete. I could not find it, so, by accident, I came upon the solution and have benefited from it since January 22 of this year(2016).
FAMLi is a blend between a Spreadsheet, word processor and Database. It was shown to some friends and clients, after which it developed it into something much larger than anticipated.
You see, everyone has the same digital issue... lost data, hard to find data, too many programs to have to keep open, and the list goes on.  We need to get to documents, files, folders, programs, websites, images, PDFs, videos, emails and more. We need to access clouds, networks and all manner of places on the world wide web! All done from ONE PAGE in 2 Clicks!



Imagine being able to get to everything you need very fast, any time, with EVERYTHING on one page! Anything you need is only 2 clicks away. 


I can do that now, as can many of my clients and beta testers. No more open windows for ""convenience"" taking up processor speed and screen space. Features


No programming
Inexpensive
Customizable
UNLIMITED LICENSING! No License renewal

EVERYTHING is on one page. Click!

Keeps your computer running faster
No NAG ware
No upgrade Hounding
Backwards/Forwards Compatible
Easy to transfer (Cut and Paste)
Nothing Fancy to break
Easy to learn


What has FAMLi done for me?

I have instant access to a time-line for my projects. I know what happened, when it happened and what was done about it.
I have NO searching to do. Literally.
I can update everything very fast and link to other programs that keep data related to the projects. 


FAMLi has freed up so much time, that I had to buy new instruments to learn to play. (That is what I told my wife, so I need your support on this, folks!)


It is entertaining to open FAMLi and look at accounting and banking. Everything is on one page.
My computer runs faster since I do not need to keep all those windows open for ""convenience"".
I have no fear when someone asks when this or that happened. I no longer have to search, I simply ""find"".

Time-Line Example (included in FAMLi)



FAMLi offers any level of detail you wish to keep track of. 
You can use any picture or title that you want, like wallpaper. I happen to be a Star Trek Fan, so let's start with my personal cover page:



Here you have all your projects, clients, patients, school or college classes, etc. 
  Keep track of your thoughts, your work, your business, your life. Everyone has great ideas...and my clients did... they ""one-upped"" me. 
While it is great to have the software working the way it does on your home desktop... WHAT IF, you could make FAMLi portable! Take the familiarity, and that convenience, with you anywhere! 
Use it on any computer...anywhere, anytime, any operating system. That is what they have tasked me with! 


You don’t need the laptop, but you can take it if you like. I do. The laptop has the standard stuff on it, but the real data is on all the devices you see above. Below is what you see when FAMLi is plugged in. Click on Run...                   
How many of you really clicked on the run? Be honest! 
Ok, its portable, were my clients happy? Sort of...they wanted everything including the FAMLi Sync! So, ok... we now Sync the  data  so everything stays aligned. What ever you plug into the FAMLi members Sync with each other. 
Ok, it is Syncing now, were my clients happy? Sort of...they wanted to make sure there was encryption on the devices. The portable devices are so small, perhaps they might misplace them, then what? 
Ok, it is now encrypted, were my clients happy? Well, sort of. You see, encryption can be broken... just like all those requests did to me:


The next request will mean a partnership with some additional companies. They want to make FAMLi ""mission impossible"" proof. If the wrong PW is put in more than twice, the data goes up in a puff of smoke (without the smoke, of course.)  Never use an open WiFi...we all know that (or at least heard it), so now my clients want a safe way to browse and check their banking and emails with no concerns of sniffers being around the corner, or in another room above or below. We can do that! I do! We may team up with Keezo, another Indiegogo member.     So the result is, you have your FAMLi wherever you go, all your data, familiar programs, tools, email programs and personal browsers. Feel right at home no matter where you need to be, and know that FAMLi will never leave any digital dust on the host computer at a friend's house, hotel or even a competitor’s office. Maybe the Pentagon needs our FAMLi rather than those ""always-getting-lost-laptops""! 
It all stays in the FAMLi. (Yes, that was intentional). (Grin) Just  watch out for that printer though!! They have lots of memories, so take care of what you print. That ""cool"" selfie you took in the shower might make it onto Facebook! 
Can We Do IT?
Yes. It just takes time and money. The time we have, the money...well...we are hoping so... with your help. All contributors will get  the FAMLi Desktop. We just want the program to be slick and meet as many needs as possible. I would not mind the encryption, and there are many out there that do not like the cloud...I am one of those. 

The Cloud

The cloud is not a ""safe place"". That should be obvious now. Here are just a few articles that support the notion that these companies are all forced to offer a key to any authority when asked. Here are some articles on the matter: 
https://reviews.gethuman.com/Indiegogo/No-response-to-multiple-emails-buggy-website-ove/_~r213536
http://computer.howstuffworks.com/cloud-computing/files-safe-in-the-cloud.htm
http://www.blackstratus.com/how-safe-cloud-security/
https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=The+cloud+is+not+safe
FAMLi allows you to keep your data safer, and away from prying keyboards by making data management easy and fast with incremental backups, to keep your data local and private. Thanks to my clients insistence, everyone can now keep it all in the FAMLi with as many backups as they need. Remember, no licensing restrictions.At least, you have a practical choice concerning your level of security now. 
Perks

This is where things get interesting. The goal of FAMLi is to build a great customer base, make improvements (when practical!) and get FAMLi ready for a larger entity to take it over and grow it. 
There is a good business plan in place. If we all participate, and polish the program as much as we can, someone will look to buy it up...happens all the time. To keep contributors loyal, we will be sharing profits with all contributors. 18% of the sales will be allocated to share in  a rebate. Spend it on another product, support another inventor, or take your better half out to dinner. 




The way this works is to have your friends buy one copy. And their friends buy one copy. The resulting sales will arouse the interest of those larger entities. You can do the math on the earnings, it is simple. Point is, you all get the program, get organised... like me... and receive something more. Help to participate in the FAMLi sales, improvements and, possibly, its buyout. That is the goal. After all, you saw how my clients broke me on the encryption request! We are building to share and ultimately to sell. To me, it's only fair. 
FAMLi PERK REBATES
Indiegogo people are loyal, and we want to reward that loyalty. 18% of profits will be allocated for re-distribution to our backers. It seems fair, more fair than banks! Supporters deserve more than just the product when possible. 
Some time ago, I walked into a local computer parts store where I saw a small laptop I liked, an MSI. The owner gave it to me! Just handed it over. WHAT??? Turns out, I was his best customer. I bought more parts and stuff than anyone else. I liked the feeling, and want to offer it back to FAMLi supporters. 
Read the perks section and choose only what you can afford.
All FAMLi programs come with Income Analysis and Travel Expense programs built in. 

SUMMARY


FAMLi allows you to do more work in less time because you waste no time hunting for anything. 

Multi-tasking is made simple. Have a thought on a project, an epiphany maybe? Click on that project, click on the notes (if need be) and jot it down fast! Then you are right back where you were, and you are free to cruise along with that epiphany safely documented. It is a good feeling. 


FAMLi replaces no programs...rather it compliments ALL programs. FAMLi is  intended to help you navigate all your data from one simple page. 

                     Here is one of my project pages, this one for Indie, in fact:

From here I can get to any file or folder related to this project, or link to other computers, the server, or the web. No hunting. Click , click and I am there. 






Pages are animated to keep your attention where it is needed.  The calendar flashes for appointments (see video below) that are upcoming, or events that are critical...anniversaries! A real game-changer if one is missed! 

I have a complete verbose time line of everything. It can be shared with 2 clicks as needed. I know all the costs... I know everything about the project.
Even this program was managed by FAMLi. 

FAMLi keeps things private, portable and up to date. Choose your level of Paranoia Security.

Backup, work and share offline or off-grid. 

 Your digital world is now under YOUR control!!

Was designed to keep us from drowning in Digital Data.    The ""TEAM""





Of course, I have my many collaborators that help, comment and buy beer on special occasions. They have been invaluable reviewers and supporters. Oddly, I don't see them sitting next to me at 2AM when I am coding...Weird, eh?

Last month we launched on Kickstarter to get funding to create the tooling for BOB. Thanks to the amazing support of our backers, we smashed through our goal and ended up with more than 3 times what we originally asked for. This money allowed us to start tooling halfway through the campaign so that BOB could reach our backers sooner.We came to Indiegogo to offer BOB to a whole new crowd who may not have had the chance to see him yet.

</div>","Introducing beamust™
    Today
security and privacy on your online information and communication is requested
by most of us (to evaluate your needs you can use simple check list). However
many security and privacy tools are hard to setup, difficult to use and require
several changes that may impact your usage. Imagine being able to access all
your favorite applications from a safe and secure platform that offers a secure
and private zone that will enable you to protect any of the data (not only
files)? Now you can, with beamust.

accounts on social media to use this system.

What is beamust™


The personal/professional information and data you own, share and use on internet is one of your most valuable assets. It’s also one of the most threatened.
Keeping in touch with your family, friends or colleagues has never been easier with the introduction of ""free"" networking services. But they have their price. Every time you send information across the internet, whether it’s an e-mail, an entry in your social network calendar or any one of countless other online activities, you become a player in a very big game of chance. At any time, that data is at risk of being analysed, stolen or sold for profit.    



Our mission is to restore confidence and reliance about sharing information and personal/professional data on the internet. Providing protection and empowering usage of your valuable data and online information will be intuitive and seamless with beamust™.







Main features













 
Universal mail













The Universal mail service offers the full functionality you would expect in handling your e-mail communication such as folders for drafts, sent mail, spam, trash, tagged mail and the inbox which can be segregated into private mail, social notifications and promotional mail. It also provides the capability to export into beamust™ Briefcase and back-up emails in an independent format such as HTML. 
Users have  cross functionality over all email accounts they hold, regardless whether they are provided by beamust™, conventional email providers, the company you work for, or your own personal website/blog. 
Universal mail is seamlessly integrated with other services such as beamust™ Messaging, Calendar and Contact. For example, you will be able to establish new connections between these services via the keywords and search tags. This underlying intelligence of your individual beamust™ environment and Universal mail service will adapt and grow with its usage.
 




 
Innovative calendar













The innovative calendar and social events management interface features an innovative and stylish user interface. It displays notifications that are timed and dated  throughout your beamust™ Mail communication and social network.

For example the users calendar can also be linked to other calendars within the system to present information on shared interests and appointments. This access can be configured in such a way that only the information that is shared via common interests, such as a contract of work or wedding.
All of the appointments and information relating to the calendar can be grouped and  presented in a separate window within the Innovative calendar interface. This gives the user the ability to recognize the relations between appointments and dates. In this environment, important events are grouped and given their relevant tags which are also color coded making the system easy to use for both visual and kinesthetic learners. Through each tab, all information related to the group from throughout the beamust™ environment is only one click away.

Whether it be soccer, football, or basketball the PRO-HANDS® Sports Bottle has the realistic look and feel of what the pros play with. These miniature sports balls have a soft spongy filled cavity that retains an 8oz baby bottle or toddler sippy cup.

<p>No venture or project comes without
risk and challenges and we work hard to ensure a seamless campaign. We are so pleased to report
that AVA is nearly complete. All AVA’s shown on this page and in the video were
built on our production line. We are currently ramping up at the factory and
are ready to see this campaign take off! If anyone is ready to campaign on Indiegogo,
it’s us! Bring it on.</p>
<p><b>Forecasting Risk</b></p>
<p>We’ve done our very best to forecast
demand and create a solid and feasible production plan. We’ve learned a lot
from past experiences, and we realize forecasts are less accurate, and may not always
hit the mark. Should we miss projections, we will be sure to let you know why
and take proactive steps to resolve any possible production issues as quickly
as possible.</p>
<p><b>Supply Chain Risk</b></p>
<p>We’ve built a very capable team who
have worked for the past 3 years on all our products. However, component delays
and unexpected shortages can occur. We pride ourselves in logistics and since
it is a vital component for our operation, we have ensured a smooth supply
chain from factory directly to you! Nonetheless, barring any unforeseen
circumstances, and due to the unpredictable nature of transportation, we will
let you know immediately if we encounter any hiccups on along the way! It’s

<p>A device to protect your home from water damage; warning you through a beeping alarm, companion smartphone app, and social media including email, Twitter, and Facebook. You'll also get an low battery alert when the battery drop below 20% of capacity.  </p>
<p>With Home Smart Water Detector (HSWD), you will know when and where you have a leaking issue in your home before it becomes a costly problem through the alarm, companion smartphone app, and social media including email, Twitter, and Facebook. Once your HSWD devices have been configured by using the App, you may not need to open the App. You will get the water alerts on your social media.  </p>
<p>You can also check all the data history of your HSWD devices on your smartphone. There is analytics data including alerts, battery capacity, temperature reading, and humidity reading. The user can place Home Smart Water Detector (HSWD) devices in any potential flood spots; such as next to your hot water tank, bathrooms, basements, kitchens, washing machine, water heater, sink cabinet, sump pump, garages and so on. </p>
<p>When the HSWD device detects any water leaking, even if it's only a small amount of water, it will sound a very loud alarm. This alert is also sent to your smartphone, and social media (email, Twitter, and Facebook), so you know that you have a water leaking issue that needs your immediate attention. </p>
<p>Even if you are not at home or your smartphone runs out of battery, your friends or family are still able to see the alert over social media. They can inform you about the water alert. Your home has full protection with HSWD. </p>
<p>We have this awesome idea. With your help, we can make it a reality. Please help this project and you will get awesome rewards in return. </p>

</div></div>","Wireless charging has never been this phenomenal. Fast, easy, clutter-free, invisible and eye-catchy. Imagine you simply set phone on top of a clean desk and it starts charging automatically. That would just make people go WOW!
 

 
 
MEET iMAG W1
 
iMAG W1 spot for invisible/hidden installation that brings convenient, fast and cable-free charging into all sorts of environments(public, office, home, restaurant, etc.). Universally-compatible, Qi-certified charging pads are easily installed at any location to provide an enhanced user experience in any environment. 
 
 

⚡Fine-tuned for iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone 11 Series to safely provide up to 7.5W 
⚡Designed to provide Samsung wireless-charging phones up to 9W 
⚡Qi-certified for full functionality with all Qi-enabled devices up to 10W 


 

In fact, It’s the most compatible invisible wireless charger in the world that charges through 45mm thick surface!
  CHARGE THROUGH ANY SURFACE
 
W1’s patented transmitter tech enables a wider transmission range of electrons through a thicker barrier(45mm) and juice up your device wirelessly. It’s the most penetrating invisible wireless charger in the world! That means W1 suits most of the table/desk/counter on the market. So you don’t have to worry about compatibility, it has no hassle charging through a very thick surface. 
 

 
iMAG W1 offer two models (30mm & 45mm)
*Please note that the iMAG W1 30mm and iMAG W1 45mm are of the same size but of different weights. Also, the iMAG W1 45mm needs to have a pre-installed receiver/ sticker on the table surface for optimum results.
 
Charge through 53mm (2.1 inches) away in real case

 
ULTRA CONVENIENT
 
The iMAG W1 Fast Wireless Charger is very convenient to use. It removes wire from wireless charger and transforms any surface into a fast-charging dock. And the best thing is you won’t have to deal with wires or cluttered surfaces; it is a convenient and neat way to keep your phone powered up and the surroundings clutter-free.
  

CLEAN & NO DISTRACTION
 
Easily keep your desk tidy with the iMAG W1. The feeling a clean desk gives you is energizing and sometimes inspiring. The desk is clean, you are focused and work is going to get done! 
 


 
EASY INSTALLATION
 
Apply iMAG W1 is very easy, no construction experience required. Steps are as follows:

Use the two magnets(comes within the kit) to identify the ideal placement position.
Slide the charger’s sleeve out, peel the top sticker from it and then mount it below the surface at the identified spot using the reusable adhesive holder.
You can now slide out the magnets while fixing the wireless charger into the affixed sleeve below.
 Plug in the power line, place your phone on the surface and then charge away.

 

 
Compare to the regular hidden wireless charger on the market, iMAG W1 is much easier to install.No construction needed, and no damage to the furniture. Just as easy to set up as 1-2-3-4! A true Plug-and-Play experience.
 
 
Regular Hidden Wireless Charger (diffcult to install)

 
MERGE INTO THE ENVIRONMENT
 
iMAG W1 is equally as strong charging through most table materials including wood, plastic, glass, quartz, granite, marble among others. It can also charge through phone cases!

Just out of sight but not out of mind, the iMAG W1 charges your phone in an invisible form in a range of environments thereby keeping each surface neat and clutter-free. This allows you to go about your activities without worrying about messy surfaces or the risk of tripping over wires.
 

 
    

 
We have adopted a special coil manufacturing process to ensure the accuracy of the coil parameters and realize ample fixed frequency fast charging based on inductive magnetic resonance. 
The double-layer Alpha winding method is used to solve the influence of ordinary winding mode, adding efficiency and contributing towards the symmetry, thickness and performance of the charger while eliminating leakages.
 


 
 
PLEASE NOTE We only offer four standard plugs: 


European standard plug
American plug
British Specification Plug
Australian gauge plug.

At that time, we used open source hardware such as Arduino and free IoT cloud platforms like Yeelink and xively to make various kinds of remote smart devices by ourselves, for example, adding a wifi power socket at home which could be remotely controlled via the internet.</p><p>Later, the concept of IoT became more and more popular. After seeing our successful smart hardware released one by one, many traditional manufacturers contacted us, hoping that we could provide them with such a program of smart hardware. These free IoT cloud platforms for developers/makers was not able to meet the demand of commercial indie devices direct accessing. Therefore, we had to redevelop and deploy a unique IoT cloud server for manufacturers’ indie devices.</p><p>While developing the basic framework of these IoT cloud servers, we found there are few open source IoT projects on the internet. When it comes to the demand of other platforms, you can find many, for example, there is Wordpress for blogs, Zencart for online shops, phpbb for BBS. However, when you want to build an IoT cloud server, it’s very hard to find similar open source projects, so you can only use free platforms such as Yeelink/xively. Based on such situation, after completing the development of several customized projects by using this basic framework, we decided to release it as open source so that more developers in need can directly deploy and use it to realize the basic functions of IoT cloud server. </p>Back then, we completed some different projects about smart devices. The IoT cloud servers used in those projects all had the same basic framework. With some slight modifications, we applied the framework into different projects, and all of them worked. That framework we talked about was the the prototype of this IoTgo platform.<br/><p></p><div>
<h1>About IoTgo<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""> </span>
</h1>
<p>You can deploy an IoT cloud server using IoTgo just like building your online mart using zencart. </p>
<p>Different from simply building an online shop, you also need hardware devices that connects to server and even support from mobile APP after you build an IoT cloud server. If you would like to use IoTgo to build this server, don’t worry about them either, because we also provide the open source hardware reference design and the open source software code to connect the server. IoTgo is a complete ecological chain of smart devices but not only just a set of server code. </p>

<p>If you want to build an IoT cloud platform similar to Yeelink/xively and provide it for other users to use, the only thing you need to do is to buy a server host, deploy an IoTgo and simply edit the content on the foreground pages, and then you can open it to the public. </p>

<p>If you use IoTgo to build the IoT cloud server, you don’t have to worry about the development of hardware devices. We offer several reference hardware design and software developer's kits(SDK) based on open source hardware platform, and they support Arduino and Raspberry Pi developers respectively.

</div></div>","Why We Develop IoTgo? Two years ago, we began to be interested in smart hardware. At that time, we used open source hardware such as Arduino and free IoT cloud platforms like Yeelink and xively to make various kinds of remote smart devices by ourselves, for example, adding a wifi power socket at home which could be remotely controlled via the internet.Later, the concept of IoT became more and more popular. After seeing our successful smart hardware released one by one, many traditional manufacturers contacted us, hoping that we could provide them with such a program of smart hardware. These free IoT cloud platforms for developers/makers was not able to meet the demand of commercial indie devices direct accessing. Therefore, we had to redevelop and deploy a unique IoT cloud server for manufacturers’ indie devices.While developing the basic framework of these IoT cloud servers, we found there are few open source IoT projects on the internet. When it comes to the demand of other platforms, you can find many, for example, there is Wordpress for blogs, Zencart for online shops, phpbb for BBS. However, when you want to build an IoT cloud server, it’s very hard to find similar open source projects, so you can only use free platforms such as Yeelink/xively. Based on such situation, after completing the development of several customized projects by using this basic framework, we decided to release it as open source so that more developers in need can directly deploy and use it to realize the basic functions of IoT cloud server. Back then, we completed some different projects about smart devices. The IoT cloud servers used in those projects all had the same basic framework. With some slight modifications, we applied the framework into different projects, and all of them worked. That framework we talked about was the the prototype of this IoTgo platform.
About IoTgo 

You can deploy an IoT cloud server using IoTgo just like building your online mart using zencart. 
Different from simply building an online shop, you also need hardware devices that connects to server and even support from mobile APP after you build an IoT cloud server. If you would like to use IoTgo to build this server, don’t worry about them either, because we also provide the open source hardware reference design and the open source software code to connect the server. IoTgo is a complete ecological chain of smart devices but not only just a set of server code. 
Please click HERE to learn more about the IoTgo framework, features, advantages and API introduction, here we are not going to describe them again:
http://iotgo.iteadstudio.com/about
IoTgo and iotgo.iteadstudio.com 

Visit iotgo.iteadstudio.com, you can see what a living IoT platform looks like. This platform can be an example for experience and reference. Besides, it is our real operating IoT server as well.
If you need a free IoT cloud platform for your DIY device, you can register on iotgo.iteadstudio.com and login to use the service this platform provides. It is just like Yeelink and xively which is open and free for developers and makers. Since the website is still at its inception phase now, both functions it offers and the interface display are very simple, but we will continue to improve and update them. 
IoTgo and Yeelink/xively

If you want to build an IoT cloud platform similar to Yeelink/xively and provide it for other users to use, the only thing you need to do is to buy a server host, deploy an IoTgo and simply edit the content on the foreground pages, and then you can open it to the public. 
IoTgo and Open Source Hardware

If you use IoTgo to build the IoT cloud server, you don’t have to worry about the development of hardware devices. We offer several reference hardware design and software developer's kits(SDK) based on open source hardware platform, and they support Arduino and Raspberry Pi developers respectively. For more information about open source hardware devices, please see HERE:
IoTgo and Smart Hardware



IoTgo can offer you support as well, if you want to build a cloud server for commercial smart devices. IoTgo can distribute device ID and verification codes massively for indie products on the background, and it also enables indie products to connect the register server directly. 

What IoTgo Can DO?!

<p><b>Q: What is unique about BRICWAVE Xtreme?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> It is a hardcore
protective case which will resist punishing conditions. It consists of high
impact resistant PC and shock absorbing soft TPU that creates optimal conditions
for protecting an iPhone. The PC outer shell will dissipate the impact when it is
hit against hard objects, while the soft TPU will immediately absorb the energy
of the impact. There are no gimmicks for water protection. We try to keep it
simple, but effective, with plug-in features for when an iPhone might come into
contact with water.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does the iPhone’s ID Reader work within the case?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> At the present time, it is
challenging for a hardcore protective case to achieve fingerprint compatibility
in the market. The ID reader could be achieved with a very delicate wafer thin
film covering/overlaying over the home key button. However, the wafer thin film
causes another set of issues when used in harsh environments. According to our
research, the wafer thin film is not appropriate for users wearing gloves in
snow sports or extreme outdoor activities where an environment of heavy dust is
present. At this time, a user will have to sacrifice using the home key finger
print identity feature on their iPhones in order to have water/dust/mud
resistance, in some instances. However, we have made significant efforts toward
keeping the iPhone bio-metric reader working while maintaining the
water/dust/dirt proof performance. We will keep you posted as we make progress
on this issue.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do aftermarket audio jacks fit?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> With its 7mm opening at
the audio connector, the case will be able to accommodate the majority of
aftermarket audio jacks. However, if they don’t fit, an audio extender is
included in the package.</p>
<p><b>Q: How does the new iPhone 6S design comply with the
Xtreme Waterproof Case design?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Our Xtreme case will be
compatible with both the iPhone 6 and 6S. We are preparing for the iPhone 6S release,
and are ensuring that the fundamentals of the Xtreme case design remain intact
while keeping in mind the changes that are happening to the device. If any
challenging issues arise with the Xtreme case for the iPhone 6S, we will
immediately inform you of the possible impact it may have to the design. Since
we are not able to predict the exact time of the iPhone 6S launch, the Xtreme
case launch won’t be set on a strict timeline. If the iPhone 6S release time is
later than we anticipated, it may impact our predicted schedule.</p>
<p><b>Q: How does the waterproof construction impact the
speaker performance?</b></p>
<b>A:</b> Per our study, the Xtreme water resistant case should have a unique
configuration to prevent the system from water damage.  To accomplish this, the case requires a unique
membrane to cover the bottom speakers, and a waterproof membrane that can
transfer sound, but not water, for the top ear speaker. There might be a slight
muffling effect with sound losses of around 10% to 30% caused by the unique
water resistance design. The majority of waterproof cases on the market have this
same issue. This is something a user must be willing to trade off for the
benefit of having a water resistant case.</div><div>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Is iPhone 6 Plus pre-order available in this campaign?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No, our Indiegogo campaign is dedicated only for the
iPhone 6/ 6S Xtreme waterproof case. The 6 Plus case development is in
progress, but don't have a launch timeline to share right now. We will
immediately inform you about the Xtreme iPhone 6 Plus waterproof case
development details as we exceed our funding goal. The best way to stay in the

</div></div>","BRICWAVE™ XTREME Waterproof Case: The MOST promising iPhone
protection against punishing conditions!

Advancements in mobile
technology have made smartphones a necessity. No matter the choice of phone,
ensuring its safety is an investment in itself. A practical phone case is a
prerequisite for your phone’s protection. If you are always on the go, you
require a sturdy case that matches your active lifestyle.



The XTREME Waterproof
iPhone case is an original innovation that is among the best of all iPhone
cases. This well-made case stands out because it offers the benefit of being a
fully waterproof, shockproof, and sand/dust/mud-proof casing. There is no
better way to shield your iPhone from damage than with the XTREME iPhone case.


The design of the Xtreme
Waterproof Case boasts a high impact poly-carbonate hard shell that cushions
the iPhone against hard knocks. The inclusion of a watertight soft TPU sub-structure
ensures the iPhone remains optimal even during immersion in water. Water
protection is made possible by the IP68 waterproof technology. This is
complemented by the MIL-STD-810G that offers shock protection. 






























Best in class
dust proof and waterproof (IP68 class)
High standard
crush and shock proof (Exceeds MIL-STD-810G)
Lightweight and

Superior design
Great for extreme
outdoor activity and sports










The BRICWAVE™ XTREME Case
is designed with an O-Ring gasket seal coupled with a hydrophobic membrane that
protects your iPhone from water damage by creating a water-tight environment.
This is the perfect way to ensure peace of mind when enjoying invigorating
activities in the natural outdoors.


 








Shock protection is made possible by the high impact poly-carbonate
shell and the functional substructure. This offers two-pronged protection where
the shell diffuses the external impact when the iPhone is dropped, allowing the
sub-structure to absorb the impact. 






The beauty of this phone
casing is that Apple earphones and aftermarket sets fit properly, even with the
casing. The audio extender is ideal for large third party audio jacks.



This iPhone case is the
hallmark of excellence since it is very slim and fits superbly well in fitted clothing.
You may choose to drive the six-point stainless steel screws through the case
so it is tightly sealed to prevent water damage and to keep the case closed
after drops and/or hard knocks.

<div>
<b>SmartO²</b> is a Bluetooth Oxygen Analyser for Nitrox and Trimix scuba divers.</div>
<div>More and more recreational/technical Scuba divers use Nitrox and or Trimix in their tanks to either enjoy longer dives, shorter surface intervals or to have more conservative dives. But diving with a gas with high Oxygen content has its own risks, and it's common practice for a diver to use specialized Oxygen Analyzer to check the Oxygen content of their scuba tank before using it.</div>
<div>Unfortunately, those Analysers are quite expensive and have very limited features. We think that every diver should have his own Personal Oxygen Analyser. That's why we develop the <b>SmartO²</b> !</div>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">SmartO² have 2 main components: </span></h4>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A measuring unit and an Analyzing unit. </span></div>
<div><ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The measuring unit consist of our proprietary board that reads an Oxygen Sensor, the outside temperature, the relative humidity and sends all these data via a Bluetooth connection to a Smartphone. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Analyzing unit is the free <b>SmartO²</b> Application running on your smartphone/tablet.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div>
<b>SmartO²</b> is designed to operate with any Oxygen Sensor that provide an output signal between 7 to 15 mV like Teledyne R-22S, <b> </b>Molex oxygen cell NANM01, Maxtec MAX-305 &amp; MAX-305F, Analytical Industries Inc. PSR-11-39-MD</div>

<b>Calibration:</b> For all sensors hardware, calibration is the most reference step, if this step is wrong or bad the final analysis is not good. It is common practice to calibrate an analyser before each use. With <b>SmartO²</b> it's quite simple as the smartphone, in addition to showing the profile of your measurements, will also save the resulting calibration as a reference for an defined time that will be used for subsequent analysis. An optional compensation parameter is present for the Temperature/Relative Humidity because when you choose air as calibrating choice, the Oxygen percentage in the air is not always the same and depend of this coefficient. Thanks to the pressure restrictor with a DIN fitting which can be used directly in a DIN cylinder valve or in an A clamp with a DIN female fitting, and aa tee piece are used. Not use the pressure restrictor can creates high pressure and cold air on the sensor face and can permanantely damage the sensor. A poor fit can cause a ""Venturi effect"" drawing fresh air into the sensor an generate an artificially high reading.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Analyser:</b> In analyzer mode, you can program the <b>SmartO²</b> to perform an analysis on a defined time limit fixed by the user in the settings screen.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Dive Parameters calculator:</b> This screen display in meters or in feets the differents parameters of a Scuba Dive, like the maximum depth (M.O.D.) or the air depth equivalent for those who are diving with air table.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>Product Benefits</b></h3>
<div>
<b>SmartO²</b> innovative architecture moves the data computation and data display from the stand alone analyser to the smartphone, resulting in a more cost effective and flexible solution when compared to conventional Oxygen Analyzers.</div>
<div>Additionally, the ability to digitally log each measurement provide a clear benefit to the diver.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Supported devices</h3>
<div>
<b>SmartO²</b> use Bluetooth technology and therefore it will be connected to devices that support this technology. </div>
<div>We have first develop an Androïd application but we don't forget the iOS and Windows world, we will work on these OS soon, depending of the Androïd success. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Project Status</h3>
<div>We started working on this project almost one year ago, we had a proof of concept last winter and we made some private demonstration to some technical divers.</div>
<div>So now we move forward with the productization phase and we now have some functional prototypes of the circuit board, its related firmware, a beta App for the Samsung Galaxy 3, 4 &amp; 5, and a 3D printed prototype of the housing.</div>

<p>Initial costs for hardware product are very high. Prices drop with larger quantities but costs like production tooling and certification are big hurdles for startups.<br/></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered  what the CE symbols on the back on your electronics products stand for ? They certify that the products are safe to use. In order to produce the measuring unit,we have to go through many tests of electromagnetic compatibility to safety tests. </p>
<p>Therein lies the essence of crowfunding. You help small teams like us to build something which would otherwise be impossible to make. Thank you very much!</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<h5>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.1; background-color: initial;"">How can I charge the SmartO² ?</span><br/>
</h5>
<p>Connect any USB compatible power adapter to the micro USB port of the SmartO². The delivery will not include the micro USB cable, nor the power adapter. You can also charge the SmartO²  by connecting it to your computer, but it will take a little bit longer than with a power adapter because the SmartO² won't be recognized as an USB device.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.1; background-color: initial;"">Are shipping costs included in the prices of the perks?</span></p>
<p>No, you have to add the stated shipping costs depending on your country, except for Belgium and France.  </p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What you will get</h3>
<p>For one perk you will get a fully functional SmartO² with an enclosure made by injection moulding, a new oxygen sensor and a M26 adaptor for 300 bars.</p>
<p>Plug your SmartO² into an USB charger or an USB plug, charge until the red LED lights down, and then you can start to test the oxygen % of your diving bottle with you new instrument. </p>

</div></div>","Product Description

SmartO² is a Bluetooth Oxygen Analyser for Nitrox and Trimix scuba divers.
More and more recreational/technical Scuba divers use Nitrox and or Trimix in their tanks to either enjoy longer dives, shorter surface intervals or to have more conservative dives. But diving with a gas with high Oxygen content has its own risks, and it's common practice for a diver to use specialized Oxygen Analyzer to check the Oxygen content of their scuba tank before using it.
Unfortunately, those Analysers are quite expensive and have very limited features. We think that every diver should have his own Personal Oxygen Analyser. That's why we develop the SmartO² !
SmartO² have 2 main components: 
A measuring unit and an Analyzing unit. 

The measuring unit consist of our proprietary board that reads an Oxygen Sensor, the outside temperature, the relative humidity and sends all these data via a Bluetooth connection to a Smartphone. 

The Analyzing unit is the free SmartO² Application running on your smartphone/tablet.



SmartO² is designed to operate with any Oxygen Sensor that provide an output signal between 7 to 15 mV like Teledyne R-22S,  Molex oxygen cell NANM01, Maxtec MAX-305 & MAX-305F, Analytical Industries Inc. PSR-11-39-MD




SmartO² have 3 main operating modes: 
Calibration, Analyser and Dive parameters calculator

    



Calibration: For all sensors hardware, calibration is the most reference step, if this step is wrong or bad the final analysis is not good. It is common practice to calibrate an analyser before each use. With SmartO² it's quite simple as the smartphone, in addition to showing the profile of your measurements, will also save the resulting calibration as a reference for an defined time that will be used for subsequent analysis. An optional compensation parameter is present for the Temperature/Relative Humidity because when you choose air as calibrating choice, the Oxygen percentage in the air is not always the same and depend of this coefficient. Thanks to the pressure restrictor with a DIN fitting which can be used directly in a DIN cylinder valve or in an A clamp with a DIN female fitting, and aa tee piece are used. Not use the pressure restrictor can creates high pressure and cold air on the sensor face and can permanantely damage the sensor. A poor fit can cause a ""Venturi effect"" drawing fresh air into the sensor an generate an artificially high reading.


Analyser: In analyzer mode, you can program the SmartO² to perform an analysis on a defined time limit fixed by the user in the settings screen.


Dive Parameters calculator: This screen display in meters or in feets the differents parameters of a Scuba Dive, like the maximum depth (M.O.D.) or the air depth equivalent for those who are diving with air table.


SmartO² is powered by an rechargeable 3.7V / 850mA Lithium/Polymer battery 

                            


Product Benefits

SmartO² innovative architecture moves the data computation and data display from the stand alone analyser to the smartphone, resulting in a more cost effective and flexible solution when compared to conventional Oxygen Analyzers.
Additionally, the ability to digitally log each measurement provide a clear benefit to the diver.

Supported devices

SmartO² use Bluetooth technology and therefore it will be connected to devices that support this technology. 
We have first develop an Androïd application but we don't forget the iOS and Windows world, we will work on these OS soon, depending of the Androïd success. 

Project Status
We started working on this project almost one year ago, we had a proof of concept last winter and we made some private demonstration to some technical divers.
So now we move forward with the productization phase and we now have some functional prototypes of the circuit board, its related firmware, a beta App for the Samsung Galaxy 3, 4 & 5, and a 3D printed prototype of the housing.



    





We are currently in the process of manufacturing the last version of the PCB so as soon as these boards are testing, we can freeze the embedded code and the App.
Upon completion of this Indiegogo campaign we will finalize the design of the housing and proceed with the design and manufacturing of the production molds.

Manufacturing Plan
Upon the successful completion of the Indiegogo campaign, we will place production orders for enought kits to accommodate Indiegogo backers. We are also planning to launch a second, and larger production lot to support our market launch. After that, we will progressively increase manufacturing volumes based on market demand.
We have already identified the factory that will produce the boards and we are in the process of selecting a manufacturer for the molds and the housings. Lastly, we will obtain quotations from the vendors of the Oxygen sensors we plan to use in SmartO².
We plan to assemble the units, test them and manage orders fulfilment at our location in Belgium.
Once the Indiegogo phase will be completed, customers will be able to purchase SmartO² directly from our store or from authorized retailers.

Cost
Where your money goes




Initial costs for hardware product are very high. Prices drop with larger quantities but costs like production tooling and certification are big hurdles for startups.
Have you ever wondered  what the CE symbols on the back on your electronics products stand for ? They certify that the products are safe to use. In order to produce the measuring unit,we have to go through many tests of electromagnetic compatibility to safety tests. 
Therein lies the essence of crowfunding. You help small teams like us to build something which would otherwise be impossible to make. Thank you very much!


Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

How can I charge the SmartO² ?

Connect any USB compatible power adapter to the micro USB port of the SmartO². The delivery will not include the micro USB cable, nor the power adapter. You can also charge the SmartO²  by connecting it to your computer, but it will take a little bit longer than with a power adapter because the SmartO² won't be recognized as an USB device.
Are shipping costs included in the prices of the perks?
No, you have to add the stated shipping costs depending on your country, except for Belgium and France.  



What you will get
For one perk you will get a fully functional SmartO² with an enclosure made by injection moulding, a new oxygen sensor and a M26 adaptor for 300 bars.
Plug your SmartO² into an USB charger or an USB plug, charge until the red LED lights down, and then you can start to test the oxygen % of your diving bottle with you new instrument.

<p>With our mobile app, you can find an Oomf PowerHouse that is closest to you. (Or, you can happen upon it by noticing our sticker in the window, a table tent or a coaster in the venue.) </p>
<p>Then, grab or ask for an Oomf Charger, sign into the Oomf App, add a payment method (you only have to do this once... might as well do it now: oomf.it), enter the code printed on the back of Oomf charger. Plug it in at any point and voilà, you're charging! You can even have a friend activate your charger from their phone if yours is completely dead. Either way, just don't forget to return it. We'll have to charge you (or your friend) if you don't, and we don't want to have to do that. The Oomf charger can only be recharged on our charging stations, so it'll be useless to you once it's dead.</p>

<p>When users are done, they simply return the Oomf to a PowerStation at its original PowerHouse to avoid late fees or device replacement charges.</p>
<p>The charger will blink blue when it's placed correctly and for extra good-feelings, the PowerStation will send you a quick text or email thank you, to let you know it was replaced successfully. Don't worry, we'll send you text or email reminders if you accidentally walk out with it too. We've got your back because we want them back.</p>
<p>The credit card service we use is top rated for security and confidentiality of your personal information. (We're paying top dollar for it too, but it's important.)</p>
<p><b>Oomf's Oomph</b></p>
<p>Once activated, the power flows into the phone as fast as is safe for the phones. Phones can charge from 0 - 100% in roughly 45 to 60 minutes. Each charger has enough 'oomph' to fully charge two phones.</p>
<p>Fun side note: two phones can be charged at once, as long as one is using the apple connection and the other uses the micro-usb. Perfect for geek-chic couples. </p>
<p><b>Oomf Loves All Phones</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449174772/znggs256uhefgmew3rxt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Speaking of geeks (an endearing term we are proud to call ourselves) and the chic, Oomf loves all phones, supporting charging of any micro-usb device as well as any 8-pin lightning connector apple device.</p>
<p>So yes grandma, your 2005 flip phone can still be charged as long as it has a micro-USB port (don't worry about it grandma, it does), you'll just need to call me and I'll activate it for you, wherever I am. Oomf: A network of powerful, portable smart chargers people can rent while out, living a mobile life.</p>
<p><b>Oomf Power Activation</b></p>
<p>All you need to remember is that you need to visit the site or have the app to activate the charger and that it's all-in-one. (So you <i>don't</i> need to remember to bring any adaptors or to carry any cords, ever again. Leave them at home, where they belong. Please. And stop bothering bartenders to check your texts.) </p>
<p>Once you plug your device into an Oomf, the Oomf charger just needs to be 'activated' (power is remotely turned on) by going to the mobile or web app and entering the 4-digit code on the back of the device. It doesn't matter whether its from your device or from a friend's device, or where in the world that friend may be. As long as the app receives the code from the charger you want to turn on (based on the 4-digit unique identifier code) it can be activated online, from anywhere in the world. It's a bit confusing to my grandma, so please excuse the lengthy explanation.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Since you're still reading, we'll take you through the whole story.</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">From the beginning inspirations of Oomf... before it was even called Oomf, to our funding up until this point to our stretch goals if we raise more than our Indiegogo goals.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>THE IDEA </b></p>
<p>This idea of powering people on the go came from our original co-founder and CEO, James Riel, a Northeastern University graduate, while he traveled to San Diego for his annual 4th of July trip, in 2014. He was out with his buddies at a bar and he was running low on battery. James, like countless others, asked the bartender if he could charge his phone and to his surprise the bartender provided him a fully charged portable Mophie case. James was beside himself, he could stay mobile while charging his phone at the bar, and he didn't have to let the bar commandeer his phone. It wasn't a perfect solution, but it was a start that ignited the entrepreneurial fuel in James, yet again. A fuel so pure and powerful that it did not dwindle.</p>
<p>James saw the potential in providing portable power to customers at bars and restaurants and made it his mission to create a real solution for people everywhere.</p>

<p>Co-founder and CTO, Dan didn’t know him that well at the time, but after hanging out with him he was drawn in by James's drive and passion for the idea. After a few meetings, Dan was sold. They began to work through the logistics. There were a ton of questions to ask and answer. James and Dan released an alpha-model product in only a few months of coming up with the idea. It was all pretty much all off the shelf hardware, but at the time they couldn't be too picky. They were bootstrapping.</p>
<p>Wallets were emptying and James's baggie of coins was dwindling. Seriously. He had a bag of coins. And then there was $0.17 left. Dan was still full-time at another job and started to split his salary with James so that they could both afford to work on the project. And eat. They knew timing would be crucial, getting to market fast was and still is of major importance. All their eggs are lovingly placed in this basket.</p>

<p><b>ANGEL INVESTOR TURNED BOOTSTRAPPING 3RD CO-FOUNDER </b></p>
<p>Eight months in, the co-founders knew they needed to raise money to evolve and bring a true solution to market and the baggie with $0.17 left just wasn't going to cut it anymore. Their goal when shopping an initial pitch deck around was to find someone who would bring more to Oomf then 'just' cash. </p>
<p>Joining Oomf full-time himself as the third co-founder and VP of Engineering, Gavin Gray commits a large cash injection as well as his extensive experience and professional expertise to the team.</p>
<p>As charismatic and passionate as the original founders, Gavin inspired several of the best and brightest of those within his vast, extensive career network to be a part of our growing team.</p>
<p><b>THE TEAM</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449178704/r3iv1xbpfe6srp4p3xwd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We believe in the power of attraction. We think positive thoughts, we know we will be successful and we know it's only a matter of time before we change the world. Changing charging culture is only the proof we need to execute our evolving vision on a larger scale. </p>
<p>Our team is a group of brightly shining stars, a perfect potion of advertising and business professionals, technical developers and engineers. The four executives are fully committed, working full-time on a startup schedule, which pretty much means around the clock while everyone else is devoted to putting in as much part-time hours as they can while juggling full-time industry jobs. </p>
<p>Our company policy instructs everyone to take as much vacation as needed and that birthdays are considered national holidays, but we all seem to be so captivated by the light that we can't stay away. We love it.</p>
<p>The Oomf team started from a tested alpha-model concept and moved into production with a new solution in just over six months. That's six months of part-time dedication and teamwork and bootstrapped funding. (Most of the team is making this dream come true strictly based on equity.) </p>
<p>We prototyped the hardware then developed it, we conceptualized the software then programmed it. We have lined up all our manufacturing and will be ready to release by the end of the year.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h1><b>THE EVOLVING PIVOT</b></h1>
<p><b>Based on the ever-changing industry landscape and our collective ideas and capabilities, our model shifted from an off-the-shelf alpha version to the beautiful smart system we're ready to mass produce today.</b></p>
<p><b>[THE TECH] </b>Oomf technology evolves continuously, bulletproofing our service time and time again. Largely, the Oomf model evolved to activate chargers via our proprietary cloud system as well, meaning no data is transferred through the wires, only power. For one, will be able to alert Oomf users if they take the device away from the PowerHouse, reminding them where it came from (and where to return it) to avoid fees for replacement and redistribution. All PowerStations are remotely monitored, to keep tabs on things like battery integrity and device management, making sure that people get the power they need.</p>
<p><b>[THE APP] </b>The fact that there is an app is both a pivot and evolution. It works seamlessly with the new solution and cloud system to provide a simple service with unseen, utmost sophistication on the back end. For consumers, the Oomf App includes a navigation map so the power hungry can find Oomf PowerHouses hosting Oomf Chargers. This helps consumers choose where and how they want to spend their time most effectively, if their sole purpose is charging. Twenty minutes to spare? I might get a manicure while I wait. Or I'll pop over to a pub for a beer. Or two. Maybe I'll have some some broccoli bites too. Mmmm.</p>
<p>The app also rewards loyal users with a way to accumulate free charges based off referrals and overall usage. Return reminders, low battery alerts and quick route navigation to the closest Oomf PowerHouses are all on the list for features to design and create. Same for being able to see how many Oomf Chargers are in use, in real time, at any Oomf PowerHouse. That'll come in handy. It's all a matter of time. And money.</p>
<p><b>[THE INTEGRITY] </b>This is only included in the pivot because it wasn't necessary before. Now that we've baked in so much intelligence into our chargers, we make it a point to clarify that our cables provide only power, no data transfer. Any volunteered data given through our mobile app will help us to customize relevant advertising experiences to users down the road, maximizing relevancy and valued relationships between consumers and brands.</p>
<p><b>[THE LIABILITY] </b>By providing our solution as a service, we limit businesses' liability for charging people's phones. People keep their phones on them and borrow/rent our devices in the PowerHouses. PowerHouses aren't responsible for Oomf chargers walking out the door. The only lift of a finger for businesses is opening the new box and stacking the (automatically shipped) replacement Oomf charger on the PowerStation. </p>
<p><b>[THE SALES MODEL] </b>From a sales model to a pay per use model, and eventually to one that will be <i>free</i> to Oomf Customers through engaged advertising experiences, our sales docs have seen a lot of edits. That's what the alpha model was and what beta is for though, refining these details before we go global at a massive scale.</p>
<p><b>[THE DESIGN] </b>From a design standpoint, Oomf needed to be user-friendly and attractive. Keeping everything Oomf customers loved about the product (mainly the portability), we cleaned up the mess of attachable cables with a shift into an all-in-one device, with dual charging ports. It makes it extremely manageable for both Oomf PowerHouses and users. </p>
<p><b>[THE BRAND] </b>The name was the first thing to tackle. Starting as PowerUp Chargers, shifting to IonRecharge then finally landing on Oomf within the first week of hiring Jennie. Focused on being a wise source for creating transformational moments for people in search for power, Oomf strives for an intangible, magical presence--deeply connected with the human condition.</p>
<p><b>[THE SALES] </b>Less of a pivot and more of an evolution, our sales team loves securing Oomf PowerHouses because it's so easy, with our new Oomf product model. We have a 90% success rate in just over a month of pre-sales. 300 Oomf PowerHouses are signed up and ready to go.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>OUR VISION</h1>
<p>To change commerce, by exchanging branded experiences for goods and services of present, tangible value.</p>               <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>As a startup we are familiar with the many challenges and obstacles that can arise along the way, but you can rest easy knowing the team that makes Oomf possible is one you can trust to deliver. <br/>Once funded, we'll be setting up nearly 300 businesses, locally to provide Oomf charging to their customers. Our organizational efforts thus far give us confidence in being able to deliver on our mission in a timely manner. We'll continually update our community of backers if anything arises in which may cause a delay. Thank you all for truly believing in our project! </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>This is truly a product <i>for </i>the people, so please help us spread the word about Oomf and use Indiegogo's sharing tools to help us tell everyone that a better way to recharge is on the way!</p>
</div></div>","Changing charging culture, together!

We are putting power in people's hands. As an Oomf user, you'll have access to portable, fast, reliable power anywhere there's an Oomf PowerHouse--think bars, restaurants, salons, stadiums, cafés, cruise ships, ski resorts, anywhere. The more funds we raise, the faster we'll be everywhere.
Our goal is to give 'Power to the People', for free. We believe everyone should have easy access to a convenient and reliable power source. 
Imagine a brand gifting you a charge in exchange for engaging with a relevant brand experience. Mind blown? That's because we're not just changing charging culture, we're changing commerce. If that's not your cup of tea, you'll always have the option to pay for your power instead.
Freedom. Power. Connection. With Oomf, you are free to walk around while you charge. Oomf fully charges phones within an hour, with reliable power and certified cables. No need to remember to bring a cord, cable or adaptor. You can rest easy and enjoy your time because you're connected, and reachable if you want to be.
You're in charge, and the power is in your hands.


   What We Need & What You Get It's 2015, and it's time to put an end to ""tethered charging"". Oomf gives everyone access to power and the freedom of portability. Oomf will be available where and when you need it the most. The more money we raise, the faster we can be everywhere.
Funds from this campaign will go directly to help purchasing our smart chargers, finalizing manufacturing, some general expenses, and a touch of marketing efforts as we roll out our new product to the world!
We're looking to raise $150,000 in order to purchase enough chargers for 300 PowerHouses (businesses) in the Boston area. People are tired of their phones dying while they're out enjoying life with no convenient and reliable means to recharging their mobile devices. Bostonians will be amongst the first to receive Oomf charging and then it's quickly onto the surrounding cities so that everyone can recharge using Oomf. The businesses you frequent are ready to take delivery of our new charging solution and we need your help!
Our perks are designed to give you all a piece of our project, from Oomf apparel, to an office visit, a date with a co-founder, and the opportunity to be one of the first 300 businesses to offer oomf after we work out the bugs during the Beta test. Finally, as a token of our appreciation, we are also offering a Oomf Home Edition PowerStations for our special Indegogo friends, family and supporters.
 
It’s a win-win for all involved! 
Oomf Users, love Oomf Chargers because of it's portability. It allows you to keep your devices charged in an easy, affordable, safe, and comfortable way - perfect for the on-the-go millennial! Bonus: if you refer this service to friends, you can accumulate free charges!
Oomf PowerHouses (Local Businesses), especially bars and restaurants, love this idea. They are able to easily provide a charging solution to customers, without needing to worry about any extra cost or liability issues.
Oomf Platform Advertisers (Brands), those cool brands that stand for things, want to reach people and give them something of real value in exchange for a one-on-one experience with their brand with endless opportunities to engage people. 


Oomf PowerHouse
With our mobile app, you can find an Oomf PowerHouse that is closest to you. (Or, you can happen upon it by noticing our sticker in the window, a table tent or a coaster in the venue.) 
Then, grab or ask for an Oomf Charger, sign into the Oomf App, add a payment method (you only have to do this once... might as well do it now: oomf.it), enter the code printed on the back of Oomf charger. Plug it in at any point and voilà, you're charging! You can even have a friend activate your charger from their phone if yours is completely dead. Either way, just don't forget to return it. We'll have to charge you (or your friend) if you don't, and we don't want to have to do that. The Oomf charger can only be recharged on our charging stations, so it'll be useless to you once it's dead.
Oomf PowerStation

Oomf Rental & Return Process



To rent an Oomf, the process is as simple as can be. Users ask a bartender or waitress for an Oomf (speaking in the context of bars and restaurants, but any sales person will be able to help). Anytime throughout the process of launching the app and entering the code, users can pull out the appropriate charging cable (apple or micro-usb) and plug it into their device.
When users are done, they simply return the Oomf to a PowerStation at its original PowerHouse to avoid late fees or device replacement charges.
The charger will blink blue when it's placed correctly and for extra good-feelings, the PowerStation will send you a quick text or email thank you, to let you know it was replaced successfully. Don't worry, we'll send you text or email reminders if you accidentally walk out with it too. We've got your back because we want them back.
The credit card service we use is top rated for security and confidentiality of your personal information. (We're paying top dollar for it too, but it's important.)
Oomf's Oomph
Once activated, the power flows into the phone as fast as is safe for the phones. Phones can charge from 0 - 100% in roughly 45 to 60 minutes. Each charger has enough 'oomph' to fully charge two phones.
Fun side note: two phones can be charged at once, as long as one is using the apple connection and the other uses the micro-usb. Perfect for geek-chic couples. 
Oomf Loves All Phones

Speaking of geeks (an endearing term we are proud to call ourselves) and the chic, Oomf loves all phones, supporting charging of any micro-usb device as well as any 8-pin lightning connector apple device.
So yes grandma, your 2005 flip phone can still be charged as long as it has a micro-USB port (don't worry about it grandma, it does), you'll just need to call me and I'll activate it for you, wherever I am. Oomf: A network of powerful, portable smart chargers people can rent while out, living a mobile life.
Oomf Power Activation
All you need to remember is that you need to visit the site or have the app to activate the charger and that it's all-in-one. (So you don't need to remember to bring any adaptors or to carry any cords, ever again. Leave them at home, where they belong. Please. And stop bothering bartenders to check your texts.) 
Once you plug your device into an Oomf, the Oomf charger just needs to be 'activated' (power is remotely turned on) by going to the mobile or web app and entering the 4-digit code on the back of the device.

POWER TO THE PEOPLE, POWERED BY THE PEOPLE.


It's magical when people come together to make life a little bit better for everyone. Well, everyone with a battery operated mobile device. It seems the world could use a little more magic these days.

It was all pretty much all off the shelf hardware, but at the time they couldn't be too picky. They were bootstrapping.

THE EVOLVING PIVOT
Based on the ever-changing industry landscape and our collective ideas and capabilities, our model shifted from an off-the-shelf alpha version to the beautiful smart system we're ready to mass produce today.
[THE TECH] Oomf technology evolves continuously, bulletproofing our service time and time again. Largely, the Oomf model evolved to activate chargers via our proprietary cloud system as well, meaning no data is transferred through the wires, only power. For one, will be able to alert Oomf users if they take the device away from the PowerHouse, reminding them where it came from (and where to return it) to avoid fees for replacement and redistribution. All PowerStations are remotely monitored, to keep tabs on things like battery integrity and device management, making sure that people get the power they need.
[THE APP] The fact that there is an app is both a pivot and evolution. It works seamlessly with the new solution and cloud system to provide a simple service with unseen, utmost sophistication on the back end. For consumers, the Oomf App includes a navigation map so the power hungry can find Oomf PowerHouses hosting Oomf Chargers. This helps consumers choose where and how they want to spend their time most effectively, if their sole purpose is charging. Twenty minutes to spare? I might get a manicure while I wait. Or I'll pop over to a pub for a beer. Or two. Maybe I'll have some some broccoli bites too. Mmmm.
The app also rewards loyal users with a way to accumulate free charges based off referrals and overall usage. Return reminders, low battery alerts and quick route navigation to the closest Oomf PowerHouses are all on the list for features to design and create. Same for being able to see how many Oomf Chargers are in use, in real time, at any Oomf PowerHouse. That'll come in handy. It's all a matter of time. And money.
[THE INTEGRITY] This is only included in the pivot because it wasn't necessary before. Now that we've baked in so much intelligence into our chargers, we make it a point to clarify that our cables provide only power, no data transfer. Any volunteered data given through our mobile app will help us to customize relevant advertising experiences to users down the road, maximizing relevancy and valued relationships between consumers and brands.
[THE LIABILITY] By providing our solution as a service, we limit businesses' liability for charging people's phones. People keep their phones on them and borrow/rent our devices in the PowerHouses. PowerHouses aren't responsible for Oomf chargers walking out the door. The only lift of a finger for businesses is opening the new box and stacking the (automatically shipped) replacement Oomf charger on the PowerStation. 
[THE SALES MODEL] From a sales model to a pay per use model, and eventually to one that will be free to Oomf Customers through engaged advertising experiences, our sales docs have seen a lot of edits. That's what the alpha model was and what beta is for though, refining these details before we go global at a massive scale.
[THE DESIGN] From a design standpoint, Oomf needed to be user-friendly and attractive. Keeping everything Oomf customers loved about the product (mainly the portability), we cleaned up the mess of attachable cables with a shift into an all-in-one device, with dual charging ports. It makes it extremely manageable for both Oomf PowerHouses and users. 
[THE BRAND] The name was the first thing to tackle. Starting as PowerUp Chargers, shifting to IonRecharge then finally landing on Oomf within the first week of hiring Jennie. Focused on being a wise source for creating transformational moments for people in search for power, Oomf strives for an intangible, magical presence--deeply connected with the human condition.
[THE SALES] Less of a pivot and more of an evolution, our sales team loves securing Oomf PowerHouses because it's so easy, with our new Oomf product model. We have a 90% success rate in just over a month of pre-sales. 300 Oomf PowerHouses are signed up and ready to go.

OUR VISION
To change commerce, by exchanging branded experiences for goods and services of present, tangible value.               Risks & Challenges  As a startup we are familiar with the many challenges and obstacles that can arise along the way, but you can rest easy knowing the team that makes Oomf possible is one you can trust to deliver. Once funded, we'll be setting up nearly 300 businesses, locally to provide Oomf charging to their customers. Our organizational efforts thus far give us confidence in being able to deliver on our mission in a timely manner. We'll continually update our community of backers if anything arises in which may cause a delay. Thank you all for truly believing in our project!   Other Ways You Can Help This is truly a product for the people, so please help us spread the word about Oomf and use Indiegogo's sharing tools to help us tell everyone that a better way to recharge is on the way!",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

Sounderr sounds much better! This test is simply to show you the way it works.</h3><p> </p><h2>About this idea</h2><ul>
<li>Being a smartphone and tablet user daily myself, I never understood why the loudspeakers are placed on the lower edge of the devices these days. You are never in the best position for it to be in the way of the sound coming from the speaker- these are “lost-to-air” sounds, which disturb others around you who don’t need to hear what you are watching or listening to. Sounderr is a  solution to this, as it directs the sounds only to you decreasing the “spread” noise to others around you.</li>
<li>Success on Indiegogo is important for us because we would like to make the Sounderr available for as many different types of phones and tablets as possible. Each device has the speakers positioned in a slightly different way- therefore, we want to design and produce Sounderr the best way possible in order to give you the best experience when using it.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h2>Will it fit and work with my device?</h2><p>Sounderr does NOT make any connection with your phone or tablet. It is fixed through the charging connection but it uses it just as a fixation point. It makes no connection with the devices itself as it is not an electrical product.</p><p>We design and deliver Sounderr with 3 connection types: Apple Lightning, Micro USB and USB Type-C connections. All Sounderrs are delivered with the ability to attach all three of these connection types to the device.</p><p> </p><h2>What we need</h2><p>We need your support by pre-ordering our product!</p><ul>
<li>We are a small budget campaign. Our $15,000 USD goal is easier to reach if you spread our idea around and join the pre-orders now.</li>
<li>Christmas is coming! Don’t hesitate to buy more Sounderrs (have a look at our perks) and give them to your friends or family as a gadget gift. Everyone will love its features.</li>
<li>Even if we do not reach our goal we will make the Sounderr anyway but it will take a longer period of time. Your contribution helps us to make it happen sooner and gives us feedback about our product. Do you like our product? Don’t hesitate to tell us your thoughts by ordering or leaving a comment.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h2>The future</h2><p>Sounderr is really a great product but we have further goals to reach. Our passion is to develop Sounderr so it can be better and better, finding the best materials and best shape for a perfect sound-reflecting shader for smartphones and tablets. In 10 years we want to see people lying on their towels on the beach next to each other, watching different videos on their device with the maximum experiment without earplugs and without disturbing each other’s experience, hearing the noise of the waves of the ocean at the same time.

<p>     My name is Daksh Pandya. I have started a bootstrapped company called Ekraft. You will find many free games published by us. All you need to do is search for Ekraft in the Apple App Store and Google Play. Digidice compatible Apps have also been launched on the Android play Store. Our most popular games are: Snakes &amp; Ladders Board Game (the traditional Indian Board Game) - 600 k Download on Android; and, Ludo (the traditional Indian Board Game) - 150 k Download on Android.</p>
<p>     I invented Digidice which communicates and interacts with your Smart phone. Now you can play with actual dice on your smart phones. Over the last year, I have consciously worked hard to get this product market-ready from a paper prototype to a 3d printed prototype to a final Molded Finished Product. </p>
<p>     Ekraft is a bootstrapped company, so in order to reduce the cost price of the Digidice I need to manufacture this product in bulk. I will be using the Amount funded to manufacture in Bulk quantities to reduce the Cost per unit. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Break down in more detail:</p>
<p>Raise $100K to fund the manufacturing of the bulk quantity and build more compatible content to Digidice. Will also need to make new version of Digidice which is Compatible to both Android and IOS and smaller in size.</p>
<p>You get  Digidice and Tshirts as perks.</p>
<p>We will utilize the funds to manufacture Digidice in Smaller quantities which would increase per unit cost if the campaign is partly funded.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Traditionally Games played in groups were more interactive. But when the group plays on mobile it appears more isolated as everyone is glued to their individual devices. Now we are trying to bridge the  gap between the traditional ways and the modern ways by integrating a real dice to the Smart phone through Digidice.</p>
<p>Successfully, I have run my start up since 2012 without raising any external funds for our games across platforms which have crossed 2.9 million Downloads.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Mobile App and Services is not as capital incentive as creating and manufacturing a product. The production Cycle involves:</p>
<p>1) PCB designing </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
     My name is Daksh Pandya. I have started a bootstrapped company called Ekraft. You will find many free games published by us. All you need to do is search for Ekraft in the Apple App Store and Google Play. Digidice compatible Apps have also been launched on the Android play Store. Our most popular games are: Snakes & Ladders Board Game (the traditional Indian Board Game) - 600 k Download on Android; and, Ludo (the traditional Indian Board Game) - 150 k Download on Android.
     I invented Digidice which communicates and interacts with your Smart phone. Now you can play with actual dice on your smart phones. Over the last year, I have consciously worked hard to get this product market-ready from a paper prototype to a 3d printed prototype to a final Molded Finished Product. 
     Ekraft is a bootstrapped company, so in order to reduce the cost price of the Digidice I need to manufacture this product in bulk. I will be using the Amount funded to manufacture in Bulk quantities to reduce the Cost per unit. 
What We Need & What You Get
Break down in more detail:
Raise $100K to fund the manufacturing of the bulk quantity and build more compatible content to Digidice. Will also need to make new version of Digidice which is Compatible to both Android and IOS and smaller in size.
You get  Digidice and Tshirts as perks.
We will utilize the funds to manufacture Digidice in Smaller quantities which would increase per unit cost if the campaign is partly funded.
The Impact
Traditionally Games played in groups were more interactive. But when the group plays on mobile it appears more isolated as everyone is glued to their individual devices. Now we are trying to bridge the  gap between the traditional ways and the modern ways by integrating a real dice to the Smart phone through Digidice.
Successfully, I have run my start up since 2012 without raising any external funds for our games across platforms which have crossed 2.9 million Downloads.
Risks & Challenges
Mobile App and Services is not as capital incentive as creating and manufacturing a product. The production Cycle involves:
1) PCB designing 
2) PCB Soldering
3) Case Molding
4) Loading the micro-controller program
5) Testing
6) Assemble
7) Final QC 
Each of these Stages have been Successfully  Completed but we have to put same effort in to manufacturing 1000 units or 10000 units and at lower volume the cost remains high and not feasible in the long term.
