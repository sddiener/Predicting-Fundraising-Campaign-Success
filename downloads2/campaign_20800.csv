<p>Jude Taylor has written book, music and lyrics for ‘Steep’, and this is his professional debut as a writer - following years of songwriting in his bedroom and delivering community arts projects as founder of ‘The Cognito People’ (working with partners including Curve, West Yorkshire Playhouse and YoungMinds). As a writer, Jude is keen to explore creating quirky, silly musical theatre that features honest and non-apologetic representation of LGBT+ people at the heart of its stories – especially when it comes to transgender characters. </p>
<p>The idea for ‘Steep’ first came 5 years ago, and a few years later it ended up on paper for the first time. After 2 years of ‘proper’ writing and development, Jude pitched the show to The Other Palace in London in 2017, and has been incredibly grateful for the support, time and space we’ve received from them to continue to develop the work formally, mainly through private table readings in their Studio space. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why are we fundraising? </strong></p>
<p>The ‘Steep’ team and the incredibly generous actors who have participated in our previous table readings are so proud of this project and its progress, and we have put all our love into its development. However, musicals are very expensive endeavours and cannot live on love alone, and that is why we now need you! By donating to us you will be supporting the show and directly helping us to get all the resources we need together to be able to share ‘Steep’ with the world and to make these plans a reality. You’ll also have played a huge part (pun intended) in bringing a brand-new musical by a young LGBT+ writer to life, and supporting the wider new musical theatre scene/community here in the UK.  </p>
<p>When we say ‘support’, we don’t just mean financial donations, however – if you are not in a position to donate we completely understand, you can still make a HUGE difference by giving this crowdfunder a share, or sharing our updates on social media.  </p>
<p>Here are some examples of what your money will go towards: </p>
<p> - Paying our actors and creative team a proper wage for their work </p>
<p> - Rehearsal and performance space </p>
<p> - Physical resources, such as scripts and props </p>
<p>By supporting this project, you directly become a part of not just the project, but the ‘Steep’ world itself, and we couldn’t be more grateful. In fact, we’ve got a few things to say thank you if you choose to support us.  </p>
<p>For a donation of £5 or more we will give you a personalised social media shout out from the Steep team. Get exclusive updates on the progress of Steep with a donation of £20 alongside your shout out across all of our online platforms. If you are generous enough to give us £40 or more, on top of the above, we will send you a personalised thank you letter o video (your choice!). For a very generous donation of £60 or more, in addition to all the above, you will receive an exclusive sneak peek at the current draft by receiving a page of the script annotated by Jude. Finally, if you are most generous enough to dedicate £100 or over to us, you’ll receive all of the above AND Jude will even write you a song based on a topic of your choosing (within reason, of course…)! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Special Thanks  </strong></p>
<p>We want to say a HUGE thank you to every single person who has been a part of the ‘Steep’ journey so far. We would not be at this point without your time, support and generosity, including: </p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Our team consists of eleven international Arts, Culture and Media students from the University of Groningen. As our final project, we came up with an idea for an immersive theatre production dealing with themes regarding immigration and the difficulties of being ‘the other’. You can get acquainted with us through our video above.</p>
<p>However, we are finishing our bachelor degrees and after various courses at Arts, Management, Analysis, Criticism and especially majoring in Theatre we want to use all of that knowledge to create something in practice. We are doing everything ourselves and we need your help to make it possible. We have distributed the different part of the organisation and creation among ourselves - acting, scenography, dramaturgy, directing, marketing and finances. But we aim high. The project we are working on would be held on a specific location where several different rooms would be constructed. Each scene of the performance would take place in a different room. How you get inside is something for you to figure out, but as a small hint: hold onto your ticket!</p>
<p>The special thing about it is the theme behind it - the feeling of “the other”. Everything began by our mutual frustration with the limitations a citizenship can impose on a person and especially - the visa procedures one has to go through to be allowed to enter another country. Every national passport gives access to certain places and the number and the countries themselves depend on your citizenship. Some nationalities have a wide variety of possibilities, while others are very restricted. But aside from this, there is another issue - the way you are being judged by the people you meet starts with your nationality. All the stereotypes and cliches, misinformation, lack of education about other countries - every immigrant has stories to tell about how differently they are sometimes being treated.</p>
<p>What we want to achieve is to raise awareness of this social issue. It is something experienced by thousands of people on everyday bases.</p>
<p>We need 500 euros that would be used for paying the rent of the chosen location, the props we need and to build up the separate rooms and for advertisement. One of the biggest expenses would be the elaborate video and sound equipment we need in order to create the immersive experience we promise.</p>
<p>The biggest threat we are facing is exactly the lack of sufficient financial resources, but we are doing our best to minimize our expenses - everything we use would be borrowed, rented or bought from a second- hand shops.</p>
<p>Any help including just spreading the word for our project would be highly appreciated. So please, share and tell people who might be interested in sponsoring us. Everything we collect would go into the performance even if we don’t reach our entire goal. In that case, we would look for alternative sources of financing.</p>
<p>We are here if you have any questions, ideas or anything you would like to share with us!</p>
<p>Thank you for giving us a chance to create something that reflects on issues that really matter to us!</p>

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hello! I'm Mark Kydd, an actor and writer, seeking support for my new one-man show, </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">there were two brothers.</i><br/>
</h3>
<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Having performed as an actor for more than two decades, I’ve told umpteen stories; invariably other people’s stories, using other people’s words. What really excites me about this project is that it’s my own story, told in my own words and drawn from my own life.</span><br/>
</h3>
<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">I began writing last year and an early version of the project</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""> was shared at that time. Subtitled 'storytelling, secrets and sibling rivalry', the play</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""> tells the story of my relationship with my older</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">brother; it's told in tandem with a parallel tale of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">fictitious </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">brothers and takes inspiration from memories of storytelling television shows of my childhood.</span>
</h3><h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Although it's based on my own experiences and partly on my coming-out, I was thrilled to discover the play had a much broader appeal than I first imagined; it resonated with people from many different age groups and backgrounds, who identified </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">strongly </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">with the complexities, joys and frustrations of family life that are central to the piece. ""I think that anyone could connect with the story, that was what was so clever about it. The story was essentially about anyone who feels disenfranchised "" was a typical response. Inspired by this positive feedback, I felt encouraged to develop it into a fully-realised piece of theatre, with a new set and video design, which will be a integral part of the storytelling.</span>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>How you can help complete this story.</h3>
<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">I’m looking to raise £2500. Of this, 20% will go towards the physical production (design etc) to be added to a pledge of £1000 provided by Glasgay! who are </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">supporting the production (at the time of writing, our only </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">source of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">funding). The rest of the money raised will go towards paying my wonderful team  - director Ros Sydney and video and sound designer Jamie Wardrop -  fantastically talented individuals who thus far have worked for nothing. They’ve shown great faith in the project and I would like this to be rewarded, even if we fail to reach our target goal.</span>
</h3><div><br/></div>
<h3>What difference will your pledge make?</h3>
<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">By pledging towards </span><i>there were two brothers</i><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">, you’ll be supporting a fresh, emerging voice in Scottish theatre </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">and allowing new stories to be told at a time when many theatre</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">s are taking fewer risks with new repertoire. </span>
</h3><h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">You will also be enabling a flexible, innovative production with great production values to tour throughout Scotland and beyond. This means that audiences living outside Edinburgh, Glasgow or Aberdeen will have opportunities to see the show - it’s our intention to create the piece in such a way that it can be performed in many different-sized venues and configurations, without compromising on its quality. Which means more chances for you to see and enjoy the show!</span></h3>
<h3>
</h3><h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>Convinced? Check out our perks, we had fun dreaming them up and think you will have fun getting them</b></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have some great perks on offer - in keeping with the theme of the piece, they’re story-related! They include having me come to your house to read a story of your choice, or, if you go for our top perk, we'll bring the entire show into your home! It's designed to be flexible, so we'll find the way to do it. Everyone who donates will have their name listed on a dedicated page on our website, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.</span></h3>
<div><br/></div><h3><b><i>Note about perks - £100 Bedtime Story and £750 The Show in Your Home. We would love these perks to be ""without borders"" but feel sure you will understand that we must restrict these to Scotland only and will liaise with you about how and when they will be fulfilled. </i></b></h3><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our main challenge is to raise this money in such a short period of time.

<div><br/></div></div>","Hello! I'm Mark Kydd, an actor and writer, seeking support for my new one-man show, there were two brothers.


Having performed as an actor for more than two decades, I’ve told umpteen stories; invariably other people’s stories, using other people’s words. What really excites me about this project is that it’s my own story, told in my own words and drawn from my own life.


I began writing last year and an early version of the project was shared at that time. Subtitled 'storytelling, secrets and sibling rivalry', the play tells the story of my relationship with my older brother; it's told in tandem with a parallel tale of fictitious brothers and takes inspiration from memories of storytelling television shows of my childhood.

Although it's based on my own experiences and partly on my coming-out, I was thrilled to discover the play had a much broader appeal than I first imagined; it resonated with people from many different age groups and backgrounds, who identified strongly with the complexities, joys and frustrations of family life that are central to the piece. ""I think that anyone could connect with the story, that was what was so clever about it. The story was essentially about anyone who feels disenfranchised "" was a typical response. Inspired by this positive feedback, I felt encouraged to develop it into a fully-realised piece of theatre, with a new set and video design, which will be a integral part of the storytelling.

How you can help complete this story.

I’m looking to raise £2500. Of this, 20% will go towards the physical production (design etc) to be added to a pledge of £1000 provided by Glasgay! who are supporting the production (at the time of writing, our only source of funding). The rest of the money raised will go towards paying my wonderful team  - director Ros Sydney and video and sound designer Jamie Wardrop -  fantastically talented individuals who thus far have worked for nothing. They’ve shown great faith in the project and I would like this to be rewarded, even if we fail to reach our target goal.

What difference will your pledge make?

By pledging towards there were two brothers, you’ll be supporting a fresh, emerging voice in Scottish theatre and allowing new stories to be told at a time when many theatres are taking fewer risks with new repertoire. 
You will also be enabling a flexible, innovative production with great production values to tour throughout Scotland and beyond. This means that audiences living outside Edinburgh, Glasgow or Aberdeen will have opportunities to see the show - it’s our intention to create the piece in such a way that it can be performed in many different-sized venues and configurations, without compromising on its quality. Which means more chances for you to see and enjoy the show!

Convinced? Check out our perks, we had fun dreaming them up and think you will have fun getting them
We have some great perks on offer - in keeping with the theme of the piece, they’re story-related! They include having me come to your house to read a story of your choice, or, if you go for our top perk, we'll bring the entire show into your home! It's designed to be flexible, so we'll find the way to do it. Everyone who donates will have their name listed on a dedicated page on our website, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
Note about perks - £100 Bedtime Story and £750 The Show in Your Home. We would love these perks to be ""without borders"" but feel sure you will understand that we must restrict these to Scotland only and will liaise with you about how and when they will be fulfilled. Risks & Challenges

Our main challenge is to raise this money in such a short period of time. Times are hard for theatre artists, but with your financial support, plus the sum provided by Glasgay!, we will able to make there were two brothers as we always imagined it.

If we fail to hit our target we must cut our cloth accordingly, which would mean a scaling-back of our ambitions. It would also mean talented artists working for nothing. But we are very confident that with your help, this won't happen.


Other Ways You Can Help

You can help with all of this! Even if you can’t contribute financially, please help us create a buzz by spreading word about the show on Facebook and Twitter, and by using Indiegogo’s share tools. Or simply by talking about the show in the old-fashioned way.

<p></p>
<p>The Seeing Place Theater has been honored with the performance rights to present a rare revival of the epic drama and Pulitzer Prize winner: MEN IN WHITE. This play opens our 5th Anniversary Season, and we're excited to engage our audiences in getting this play to the stage. </p>
<p>Commonly referred to as the original “Grey’s Anatomy” as well as a pioneer in dramatic medical storytelling, Sidney Kingsley's racy and political play was The Group Theatre’s first critical success - and the first of its kind to take theatergoers into the heart of the operating room. </p>
<p><b>We’re proud to be the first professional company in NYC to produce a full revival of the play in over 30 years, and one of only a few to tackle the play since The Group Theatre's landmark 1933 production. </b></p>
<center>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.seeingplacetheater.com/shows/5-meninwhite.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134705/files/20131015114527-MenInWhite_tny.jpg?1381862727"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
</center>
<p><b>Why is this revival so rare? </b>The play includes a large cast (16 actors playing 30+ roles) and requires enormous precision to depict hospital life in Depression-soaked New York City in 1933. This is why we're reaching our to you - our friends, families and colleagues - to help us tell this story the way it deserves to be told. </p>
<p>More info about the show, running in NYC - November 8-24, 2013: <a href=""http://www.seeingplacetheater.com/shows/5-meninwhite.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MEN IN WHITE</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need (or How Can You Help?):</h3>
<p><b>Your Support Makes All The Difference: </b><b>After <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/danny-and-the-deep-blue-sea-and-the-lover"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our last successful Indiegogo campaign</a> in 2012, our production of DANNY AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA was extended Off Broadway and received a NYIT Award nomination. We could not have done that without supporters like you! </b><br/></p>
<p>We've already raised more than half of our budget for this play. We're asking for the remaining $5000 to help us obtain true-to-the-period costumes, set pieces and props ($2500+), as well as provide salaries for our talented cast and crew ($2500+.) Normally, theaters raise their ticket prices in order to cover costs but with our mission to provide low-price theater to audiences, we had to find another way.</p>
<p>So... raising these funds via Indiegogo will allow us to a) present this show the way it was meant to be seen, and b) subsidize our tickets so that more people can afford to attend live theater at a reasonable price. It also c) allows us to offer our ""The Seeing Place: Unplugged"" reading series, open to the public over 6 engaging evenings. </p>
<p>With your help, we hope that MEN IN WHITE can make a similar impact, helping The Seeing Place stay a part of that small yet vital minority of financially solvent non-profit theater companies that produce relevant, well-written and compelling theater that reflects its dynamic community. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Story (or who the heck we are!):</h3>
<p>Now in its 5th Season, The Seeing Place is an actor-driven ensemble known for its intense and intimate work. Since 2009, we've been passionate about and forcefully committed to:</p>
<p>THE ACTOR'S PROCESS: Through robust table work and improvisation, we focus on honoring the actor's artistry in creating a character and building a story, which extends from rehearsal into performance. It's a pro-actor philosophy, and it's rare in today's market.</p>
<p>ORGANIC STORYTELLING: Unlike other companies, we do not set staging (blocking) or cement our choices in advance. Instead, what audiences get to see is a group of actors ""in the moment"" - working off one another to tell a fresh story that is never the same night to night. It's daring, it's exciting, and yes... a little bit dangerous!</p>
<p>COMMUNITY VALUE: Our mission is to make theater accessible for all New Yorkers by keeping ticket prices low and affordable - just $12 per ticket. We produce our shows in Hell's Kitchen in the heart of midtown Manhattan, a community hungry for strong, independent theater to combat the high priced, commercial offerings of Broadway. We've been awed by the positive response by critics &amp; audiences about the unique, quality work we've been able to share at the independent theater level. </p>
<p>But don't take our word for it:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Critics Say About The Seeing Place: </h3>
<p><i><em>""In these recession strapped times, it's the best deal on or off Broadway."" <strong> </strong></em></i><br/><em style=""font-style: italic;""><strong>- </strong></em>Will Kenton, Cultural Capitol<i> (<em><a href=""http://www.seeingplacetheater.com/shows/3-closer.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CLOSER</a></em>)<br/></i></p>
<p><i>""I hope that The Seeing Place Theater continues to push the boundaries of theater in the off off Broadway community by producing thought-provoking, smart, and well-acted theatre. Oh, and tickets are only $12. You really can’t beat that.</i>” <br/>- Zak Risinger, Theatre is Easy (<a href=""http://www.seeingplacetheater.com/shows/4-lovesong.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>LOVE SONG</i></a>)</p>
<p><em>""How often does the opportunity arise to see one of the greatest American playwright's work produced by a company that takes their work as seriously as this one does, and delivers results that prove how effective that work is?"" </em><br/>- Toby Ring Thelin, Theatre Knights (&amp; Daze)<em> (<a href=""http://seeingplacetheater.com/shows/2-lefty.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WAITING FOR LEFTY</a>)</em></p>
<p><em>""This play can only be performed successfully with the type of chemistry that The Seeing Place demonstrates...

<p><em><br/></em></p>
<h3>Help Us Get The Word Out!:</h3>
<p>One amazing way to help us reach our goal, and perhaps more, is by word of mouth support from people just like you. You can start by tweeting or sharing on <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> that you donated, along with a <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/TheSeeingPlace_Season3?a=237891"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">link back to this page</a>. This will encourage your friends and followers to see what you're supporting. (If you like it, so will they!)</p>
<p>If you're in New York City (or Tri-State area), you can also help by spreading the word about our shows. We can't deliver great theater if we don't have an audience to deliver it to - please come out to the theater, and bring a friend! </p>

So... raising these funds via Indiegogo will allow us to a) present this show the way it was meant to be seen, and b) subsidize our tickets so that more people can afford to attend live theater at a reasonable price. It also c) allows us to offer our ""The Seeing Place: Unplugged"" reading series, open to the public over 6 engaging evenings. 
With your help, we hope that MEN IN WHITE can make a similar impact, helping The Seeing Place stay a part of that small yet vital minority of financially solvent non-profit theater companies that produce relevant, well-written and compelling theater that reflects its dynamic community. 




Our Story (or who the heck we are!):
Now in its 5th Season, The Seeing Place is an actor-driven ensemble known for its intense and intimate work. Since 2009, we've been passionate about and forcefully committed to:
THE ACTOR'S PROCESS: Through robust table work and improvisation, we focus on honoring the actor's artistry in creating a character and building a story, which extends from rehearsal into performance. It's a pro-actor philosophy, and it's rare in today's market.
ORGANIC STORYTELLING: Unlike other companies, we do not set staging (blocking) or cement our choices in advance. Instead, what audiences get to see is a group of actors ""in the moment"" - working off one another to tell a fresh story that is never the same night to night. It's daring, it's exciting, and yes... a little bit dangerous!
COMMUNITY VALUE: Our mission is to make theater accessible for all New Yorkers by keeping ticket prices low and affordable - just $12 per ticket. We produce our shows in Hell's Kitchen in the heart of midtown Manhattan, a community hungry for strong, independent theater to combat the high priced, commercial offerings of Broadway. We've been awed by the positive response by critics & audiences about the unique, quality work we've been able to share at the independent theater level. 
But don't take our word for it:


What Critics Say About The Seeing Place: 
""In these recession strapped times, it's the best deal on or off Broadway.""  - Will Kenton, Cultural Capitol (CLOSER)
""I hope that The Seeing Place Theater continues to push the boundaries of theater in the off off Broadway community by producing thought-provoking, smart, and well-acted theatre. Oh, and tickets are only $12. You really can’t beat that.” - Zak Risinger, Theatre is Easy (LOVE SONG)
""How often does the opportunity arise to see one of the greatest American playwright's work produced by a company that takes their work as seriously as this one does, and delivers results that prove how effective that work is?"" - Toby Ring Thelin, Theatre Knights (& Daze) (WAITING FOR LEFTY)
""This play can only be performed successfully with the type of chemistry that The Seeing Place demonstrates... This is the second production I have reviewed from The Seeing Place, and I haven’t seen a better indie theater value out there yet."" - Chris McKittrick, Daily Actor (THREE SISTERS)
“If nothing else, you’ll be supporting a theater company with “for-the-people” principals. You’ll be supporting a theater company that deserves it."" - Weston Clay, Theater is Easy (SCOTCH KISS)

Help Us Get The Word Out!:
One amazing way to help us reach our goal, and perhaps more, is by word of mouth support from people just like you. You can start by tweeting or sharing on Twitter and Facebook that you donated, along with a link back to this page. This will encourage your friends and followers to see what you're supporting. (If you like it, so will they!)
If you're in New York City (or Tri-State area), you can also help by spreading the word about our shows. We can't deliver great theater if we don't have an audience to deliver it to - please come out to the theater, and bring a friend!

</h3>My name is Isaac Banoun, and this is my story.  My early years provided me with an international background, street smarts and an ability to think on my feet that made me uniquely suited to be the entrepreneur I would become.  I was born in Cairo and barely escaped with my family at the age of five, during the Suez Crisis and the Sinai war.  Our refugee boat made it to France, and, with no resources, my family made our way to Geneva and lived there until I was eleven years old.  Emigrating to the states, we settled in Brooklyn, where I attended New Utrecht High School and LIU, once I had adjusted to the culture shock.<br/><br/>Ready to make my fortune and fluent in English and French, I moved to Montreal, Canada, when I was 21 and worked hard to learn about the corporate world.  At first a salesman for the ad specialty industry, I connected with a holocaust survivor named Elly Gotz, who owned a company called Weldo Plastics; Elly gave me a job selling custom binders for the next seven years.  Cold calling on large companies lining the Trans-Canada Highway helped fill out my business education.  I always had an outgoing personality and a gift for gab that served me well in sales, and I eventually saw an opportunity in the packaging industry that led me to California.<br/><br/>I moved to LA and, with a $25,000 investment from my mother (pretty much all she had), founded California Box, a packaging company that distributed jewelry boxes in 48 hours, a niche that no one else was handling, and turned it into a 10 million dollar business.  The boxes were manufactured in Montreal and warehoused in LA, where I created a sales organization and continued to learn about the business world.  Having developed a niche in jewelry packaging, I was one of the first American businessmen to go to China to source manufacturers for my jewel boxes and my next business: Jewelpak, a company that eventually had sales in the neighborhood of 30 million dollars.  I lived in Asia for a while and speak some Chinese in addition to being fluent in English, French, Italian and Arabic.  Wanting to create a soft, touchy-feely surface for my jewel boxes led me to the invention of a coating with a soft feel, called Soft Touch. This product was unlike anything in the marketplace, and it led to a relationship with PPG in 1997 (the largest paint company in the world) to market Soft Touch globally. This started a partnership that would generate over a billion dollars in sales.<br/><br/>From packaging to coatings to paints, I then launched a relationship with Microsoft, who began using Soft Touch coatings on their Intellimouse Explorer.  Alsa Refinish was the business born from that.  Microsoft manufactured the Intellimouse in Guadelajara, where I cultivated a partnership with an injection molding company that eventually led to manufacturing injection molded loose-leaf binders for Avery Dennison.  Alsa Refinish, first a coating manufacturing company, currently specializes in automotive paint and textures, chrome paint, vinyl car wrap films, metallics and exotic finishes.<br/><br/>Every step of the way, I applied for patents and started businesses from just a thought in my head.  I have a history of making things happen, step by step, from invention to manufacturing to marketing to worldwide sales.  Aside from Soft Touch and many of the paints we produce today, I invented Allgun, which was the world’s first gun cleaning kit to clean all size guns.  I also patented a Glow Stick marker and sprayer, which combines Glow Stick technology and can be dispensed by spray or felt tip pen.  Surprisingly enough, I am not even in the gun or toy business.  For me, as the inventor and founder, V-Meds is the crowning glory of my long and varied career.  Pure serendipity led me from wanting to stop smoking to a vaping store to an idea in my head that screamed to get out into the marketplace.  And once again, I started a business from that one idea, what I hope will be my legacy.<br/><br/><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/740442/files/20140724042053-lungs-alveoli-diagram.jpg?1406200853"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>Imagine a world where everyone can breathe free, using a revolutionary drug delivery system that produces molecules in their gaseous state as nano-droplets that can reach deep into the lungs to the alveoli, where the drugs can interact with the membrane as well as deliver them directly into the bloodstream. Other routes available for the system are sublingual, buccal and vaginal. The sublingual and buccal routes are especially important for delivering CNS drugs, including tranquilizers, analgesics and migraine drugs, to the brain.<br/><p><br/>The very device used by smokers to vaporize nicotine as a substitute for tobacco is ironically being used to deliver useful natural ingredients to clear smokers of the cancerous tar and other harmful tobacco by-products that have ravaged their lungs for years. This is our Lung Cleansing Treatment. This therapy can be used by asthma sufferers, patients with emphysema, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other lung diseases, cough and cold sufferers, patients with inflamed sinus disease. City dwellers coping with heavily polluted air can use our system, which will mobilize the pollutants and expel them from the lungs with the phlegm and fluids that are secreted; this is due to the expectorant effect of the drugs in the formulation.<br/><br/>The difference between the conventional powder inhalers and Nano-Mist is in the size of the particles delivered to the lungs. The powder delivered by inhalers is in the micron range, and those micron drug particles are deposited in the upper part of the lung, where very few get to the alveoli.  The Nano-Mist droplets are in the nanometer range and will reach the smallest areas of the lungs.</p>
<p>The Nano-Mist delivery system can be used to deliver several types of drugs for aromatherapy, including nutraceuticals, herbal products, vitamins prescription and non-prescription (OTC) for migraine, headache, pain, arthritis, nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. The Nano-Mist Delivery System can be used to deliver any drug or therapeutic agent that can be converted into a gaseous state for delivery.</p>

<p>We would like raise a minimum of $250,000.00. The funds will be used 
for R&amp;D to develop other therapeutic formulas that include migraine

pain relief, and erectile dysfunction.</p>
We will also use the funds for marketing, purchasing inventory, and patent reinforcement. If we do not reach our funding goal, we can still benefit from the money we raise.

</h3>
<p>The range and scope of this new technology will extend globally. All of humanity will benefit from our Lung Cleanser. We have 7 billion pairs of lungs on this planet that are breathing in air pollution, toxic chemicals, and tobacco. With the help of Nano Mist, there is no need for cortisone or steroids. Anyone can benefit  from this amazing product, both healthy people and individuals with lung conditions, such as COPD.</p>
<p>We have (non-regulated) human studies and wonderful testimonials from individuals who have already benefited from our Lung Cleanser.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">We understand that it may be difficult to believe some of our claims.

</div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Challenges<br/>
</h3> <p> The one challenge we face is to separate ourselves from the e-cigarette industry. Our Lung Cleanser is at the opposite end of the spectrum. It is somewhat unfortunate that I discovered my idea while using a vaping device, but this does not take away from the benefits that can be derived from using our modified vaping system to deliver this world changing solution. Think of all the inventions and discoveries over the past 100 years that have been both beneficial and harmful. Probably the most famous is the atom. It can be used to generate atomic energy and provide electricity to millions of people, or it can be used to create weapons of mass destruction and kill millions of people.<br/></p>
<p>We really do not have many hurdles to overcome, because we are using the existing e-cigarette hardware for delivering medicine, as opposed to the industry that promotes using this hardware for cigarette cessation or for pleasure.  Our product is strictly medicinal and homeopathic. <br/></p>
<p>We have a staff of medical doctors and PhD's who have assisted in the design of our custom hardware and are directly involved in the formulation of our Lung Cleansing Solution. Your safety is always our number one priority.<br/></p>

We'll be able to learn, grow, experiment, and evolve because of this experience, none of which would have been possible without you.

<p>Conteur is an established Canadian
professional dance company, founded in 2011 in Toronto, ON that incorporates modern
contemporary movement to express ideas and commentaries on the human condition.
</p>
<p><i><b>Pushing the limits creatively, Conteur’s efforts to enlighten, inspire
and entertain by exposing audiences to the beauty and intricacy of contemporary
dance is the ultimate vision.</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Conteur’s inaugural season and presentation of “State of Mind”,
was presented to a sold out audience in Toronto, ON. ""State of Mind"" raised almost $20,000.00 for the charity – THREE TO BE; in support of research, therapies and initiatives for
children with neurological disorders. <br/><br/>

<li><blockquote><strong>Conteur is dancing for those that are unable to dance,

offsetting the costs of various productions expenses including, theatre,
lighting design and parts, costuming, studio rental costs, artist salaries, and
printing costs. </p></blockquote></li>

Conteur is an established Canadian
professional dance company, founded in 2011 in Toronto, ON that incorporates modern
contemporary movement to express ideas and commentaries on the human condition.

Pushing the limits creatively, Conteur’s efforts to enlighten, inspire
and entertain by exposing audiences to the beauty and intricacy of contemporary
dance is the ultimate vision.

Conteur’s inaugural season and presentation of “State of Mind”,
was presented to a sold out audience in Toronto, ON. ""State of Mind"" raised almost $20,000.00 for the charity – THREE TO BE; in support of research, therapies and initiatives for
children with neurological disorders. 

Conteur is dancing for those that are unable to dance,
we are moving for the children; inspiring others to be a part of this change.
Sponsoring the show will aid in
offsetting the costs of various productions expenses including, theatre,
lighting design and parts, costuming, studio rental costs, artist salaries, and
printing costs. 
Without your help, Conteur is unable to successfully create a
show of this caliber, which will achieve both entertainment value and make a
difference in the community.

After working together in London for several years as actors, designers and producers, we decided to move to the big city and bring our art with us! This summer, we are extremely excited to be producing High Life, a work by Canadian playwright Lee MacDougall. This has been a passion project for quite a while and the opportunity to share it with the city of Toronto is irresistible. We place heavy importance on producing and distributing the works of local artists, to support Toronto's ""entertainment economy."" High Life is a delightfully Canadian and ironically light perspective on what is typically considered the darker way of life - the life of a junkie. Not only are the dialogue, vocabulary and style familiar, but the characters and story are also accessible, allowing the audience to connect with them on a human level. If you contribute to this campaign, not only will you be allowing a complete team of artists to achieve an amazing feat, but you will also open up a different perspective on theatre for new and veteran audiences.</p><p><br/></p><h3>You Spot Us, We'll Spot You</h3><p>We have an amazing artistic and productive team, a stellar cast, and phenomenal script, but unfortunately our money tree burnt down. Maybe yours is still fruitful? We are looking for contributions to put towards the production aspects of our show, and we can't do it without your help!</p><p>Our fundraising goal for High Life is $4000, which covers the cost of:</p><ul>
<li>theatre rental (Scotiabank Studio Theatre @ Pia Bouman School) </li>
<li>advertising (posters, press, etc.)</li>
<li>programmes (cast and crew bios, advertisements, special thanks, etc.)</li>

<li>lighting/sound (set-up and usage)</li>
<li>set (apartment interior, car interior)</li>
<li>rehearsal rental insurance (3 months)</li>
</ul><p>Your donations are invaluable to this production! Any amount possible puts us one step closer to attaining our goal, and we are more than grateful. And of course, we won't leave you jonesin' - check out our awesome perks to see what your generosity gets you! From thank you's to an Executive Producer credit, there's something available for anyone to enjoy...cause we owe ya one!</p><p>Any funds left over from production budget, or gained after the run of the show will be distributed amongst the cast and crew of the project. We are big believers in art for the love of it, but our team definitely deserves a reward for all their time, effort and commitment. </p><p><br/></p><h3>You'll Get Addicted</h3><p>High Life is a brilliantly written script by Kirkland Lake native, Lee MacDougall. It is a dark, hilarious and addictive dialogue with characters so endearing that you'll always be on their side. Dick, a plotter by nature, pitches a plan to his newly-released fellow ex-con and ""raving morphadite,"" Bug. With two other junkies on board, one a clean-cut ladies man and the other a neurotic invalid, he takes charge of a ""failsafe"" plan to rob a bank for nothing other than an unlimited, lifetime supply of morphine. But what happens when you cram four murderous, jonesin' addicts in a car together for hours on end? Well, that's why you have to come see the show...</p><p>Beyond the Round is dedicated to producing engaging theatre for a new generation of audiences. We believe that over the years theatre has become less accessible to its attendees, with there being gaps in generational style, dialogue and subject matter. It has become our goal to win over the people who wouldn't normally consider theatre as an outing, or who avoid it because of any preconceived notions or past experience. We want to show people that these characters on stage are much less foreign to them than they may think, and this is why we chose to do High Life this summer. Lee MacDougall's characters are artfully crafted into three dimensional people who would be just as believable offstage as they are on. The fact that it is set in a Canadian city and includes many enjoyable ""Canadianisms"" gives the audience a ""way in"" when experiencing the performance. Theatre is not dead, and we refuse to let it die!</p><p><br/></p><h3>Shake Our Hands</h3><p>Any and all contributions to High Life will allow a strong group of young artists to establish their professional careers in Toronto. Our team consists of two stand-up comedians, veterans of the stage, Troy Stark and Blayne Smith; we also welcome Victor Pokinko and Christian Tribuzio, two fresh graduates of the Joint UofT/Sheridan Theatre program. Together, these four make up our loveable cast of morphine-addicted junkies. We adore them, and you will too.</p><p>Blayne Smith is an up-and-coming Toronto stand-up comic. Known for his high energy storytelling, Blayne exposes funny and weird life experiences that come with being a metalhead. He performed on season two of iChannel's No Kidding series and will be appearing in season three of MTV's Losing It. In 2013, he performed as a part of Canadian Music Fest, the Dark Comedy Festival, and was a 2013 Tim Sims Award Nominee. Blayne has opened for Aisha Tyler, Robert Kelly and performed in clubs along the East Coast on his recent U.S-Canadian tour. <a href=""http://metalcomedy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://metalcomedy.com/</a><br/></p><p></p><p>
</p><p>Troy Stark’s sharp writing, sarcastic attitude, and bizarre
life experiences make him one of Toronto’s most original voices in Canadian
comedy. Before diving fully into stand-up comedy, Troy was a writer for The AV
Club. He
recently finished a 10 week stint on the road with his #NomadSummer tour, East
Coast All Day 2013 stand-up tour. He’s performed in Canada’s top clubs,
including Yuk Yuks, Absolute Comedy, The Comedy Cave, The Comedy Nest, Comedy
Works, and has appeared at The Ottawa Explosion Fest and he's been featured on
MTV's Losing It. He and Blayne are the co-creators and stars of the web
series The Shit Hawks, which recently premiered its second season, and produces
a monthly show, Classy Drunk at the Emmet Ray.  <a href=""http://thetroystark.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://thetroystark.com/</a></p><p></p><p></p><p>Kalina Hada-Lemon (Director/Producer) and Rachel Dottermann (Producer/Designer), we are your heads of production team!

With two other junkies on board, one a clean-cut ladies man and the other a neurotic invalid, he takes charge of a ""failsafe"" plan to rob a bank for nothing other than an unlimited, lifetime supply of morphine. But what happens when you cram four murderous, jonesin' addicts in a car together for hours on end? Well, that's why you have to come see the show...Beyond the Round is dedicated to producing engaging theatre for a new generation of audiences. We believe that over the years theatre has become less accessible to its attendees, with there being gaps in generational style, dialogue and subject matter. It has become our goal to win over the people who wouldn't normally consider theatre as an outing, or who avoid it because of any preconceived notions or past experience. We want to show people that these characters on stage are much less foreign to them than they may think, and this is why we chose to do High Life this summer. Lee MacDougall's characters are artfully crafted into three dimensional people who would be just as believable offstage as they are on. The fact that it is set in a Canadian city and includes many enjoyable ""Canadianisms"" gives the audience a ""way in"" when experiencing the performance. Theatre is not dead, and we refuse to let it die!Shake Our HandsAny and all contributions to High Life will allow a strong group of young artists to establish their professional careers in Toronto. Our team consists of two stand-up comedians, veterans of the stage, Troy Stark and Blayne Smith; we also welcome Victor Pokinko and Christian Tribuzio, two fresh graduates of the Joint UofT/Sheridan Theatre program. Together, these four make up our loveable cast of morphine-addicted junkies. We adore them, and you will too.Blayne Smith is an up-and-coming Toronto stand-up comic. Known for his high energy storytelling, Blayne exposes funny and weird life experiences that come with being a metalhead. He performed on season two of iChannel's No Kidding series and will be appearing in season three of MTV's Losing It. In 2013, he performed as a part of Canadian Music Fest, the Dark Comedy Festival, and was a 2013 Tim Sims Award Nominee. Blayne has opened for Aisha Tyler, Robert Kelly and performed in clubs along the East Coast on his recent U.S-Canadian tour. http://metalcomedy.com/
Troy Stark’s sharp writing, sarcastic attitude, and bizarre
life experiences make him one of Toronto’s most original voices in Canadian
comedy. Before diving fully into stand-up comedy, Troy was a writer for The AV
Club. He
recently finished a 10 week stint on the road with his #NomadSummer tour, East
Coast All Day 2013 stand-up tour. He’s performed in Canada’s top clubs,
including Yuk Yuks, Absolute Comedy, The Comedy Cave, The Comedy Nest, Comedy
Works, and has appeared at The Ottawa Explosion Fest and he's been featured on
MTV's Losing It. He and Blayne are the co-creators and stars of the web
series The Shit Hawks, which recently premiered its second season, and produces
a monthly show, Classy Drunk at the Emmet Ray.  http://thetroystark.com/Kalina Hada-Lemon (Director/Producer) and Rachel Dottermann (Producer/Designer), we are your heads of production team! Together we have tackled almost every role in the theatre, from acting to directing, producing to stage managing, and have formal film training both on and off-camera. We have been working together for years, have two award-winning shows behind us and are now thrilled to be in the big city! It couldn't be more exhilarating to be sharing our work with Toronto and becoming a part of its integral artistic community.If Your Money Tree is also MalfunctioningHey, I hear you, but money isn't the only way you can help us out!

<h3>What's going on!?</h3>
<p>Spawned by the <b>American Repertory Theater</b> and the <b>Moscow Art Theater</b>, Empirical Rogue has been producing theater in New York City since 2011.</p>
<p>In December, we start rehearsals for an exciting new adaptation of Nikolai Erdman's black comedy, <i>Suicide!?</i></p>
<p>This have-to-see-it-to-believe-it farce speaks directly to the experience of many Americans, still struggling to move forward in a stagnant economy. In the last few years, we've all felt less secure, less optimistic, and more desperate.</p>
<p><i>Suicide!?</i> is the play that has the temerity to ask ""<b>what the f*** is going on here?</b>""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We're going to bring audiences together to laugh like stupid, rethink the world, and connect with all the other brilliant, good-looking audience members that will be coming. You read that right.</p>

<p style=""font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: #00ae00;""><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: x-large;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Home Grown Theatre Co. is a non-profit company (501(c)3 status pending) run solely by students. In summer 2013, Home Grown will be doing three completely high school student productions: </span></span><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Frost/Nixon</span></span></em><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">, </span></span><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Into the Woods</span></span></em><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">, and </span></span><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Metamorphoses</span></span></em><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">. That's right, these productions are made up of just students, from the company founder (who graduates high school in May), to the entire cast and crews making each show. But just because these productions are in the hands of the “dreaded teenager” doesn't mean they aren't of quality, professionalism, and skill. In fact, these productions will have all of this and more. Last summer, Home Grown produced an all-teen benefit of the hit Broadway musical </span></span><em><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">RENT</span></span></em><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">, with proceeds from ticket sales ranging in the $6,000 range and going to the theatrical charity Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. The entire production was the experience of a lifetime, giving everyone involved (most of whom will be returning this season) an extraordinary preparedness for life and the journey into the future. All of the funds raised for this season support the education of those involved, and the time we learn the most is when we're on our own with no help, after all. Not to mention as much of the ticket proceeds as possible will again go to the charity Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Home Grown Theatre Co. is a non-profit company (501(c)3 status pending) run solely by students. In summer 2013, Home Grown will be doing three completely high school student productions: Frost/Nixon, Into the Woods, and Metamorphoses. That's right, these productions are made up of just students, from the company founder (who graduates high school in May), to the entire cast and crews making each show. But just because these productions are in the hands of the “dreaded teenager” doesn't mean they aren't of quality, professionalism, and skill. In fact, these productions will have all of this and more. Last summer, Home Grown produced an all-teen benefit of the hit Broadway musical RENT, with proceeds from ticket sales ranging in the $6,000 range and going to the theatrical charity Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. The entire production was the experience of a lifetime, giving everyone involved (most of whom will be returning this season) an extraordinary preparedness for life and the journey into the future. All of the funds raised for this season support the education of those involved, and the time we learn the most is when we're on our own with no help, after all. Not to mention as much of the ticket proceeds as possible will again go to the charity Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.

Charity + Education + You = An extraordinary opportunity to do something different

A stellar lineup of shows for 2013 – with a stellar production team.
Home Grown Theatre has chosen a careful line-up this year that is sure to excite audiences just like last year's production of RENT. That being said this stellar lineup also comes with a stellar production team working behind it, each member hand-picked by founder Hersh Ellis himself for their motivation and professionalism.

“We're all emotionally invested in all parts of the show. We own it. We want it to be our best.” - Home Grown Theatre Co. Artistic Director Hersh Ellis in an interview for The Jewish Chronicle

Home Grown Theatre Co. is proud to announce its 2013 summer season. Kansas City’s only entirely student run theatre company, under Artistic Director Hersh Ellis, Home Grown is launching three brave, unique and bold productions ranging from a haunting reinvention of a Sondheim classic to a beautifully staged exploration of change.
Frost/Nixon
June 5-9 at 8:00pm
Written by Peter Morgan
Directed by Will Barboza
Concept art for Frost/Nixon under direction by Will Barboza, Director in Residence.
British talk-show host David Frost has become a lowbrow laughing-stock. Richard M. Nixon has just resigned the United States presidency in total disgrace over Vietnam and the Watergate scandal. Determined to resurrect his career, Frost risks everything on a series of in-depth interviews in order to extract an apology from Nixon. The cagey Nixon, however, is equally bent on redeeming himself in his nation's eyes. In the television age, image is king, and both men are desperate to out talk and upstage each other as the cameras roll. The result is the interview that sealed a president's legacy.
Nominated for the 2006 Tony Award for Best Play and 2008 Academy Award for Best Picture.
""…a thoroughly modern Shakespearean tragedy…Peter Morgan has given us a behind the scenes look at a well-publicized event, and used his imagination to create a riveting entertainment…most notably, the midnight phone call from an inebriated Nixon to Frost that, like a show stopping song in a musical or an outstanding opera aria, has the audience bursting into applause."" — CurtainUp.
""…ripe entertainment…The cheerily oblivious limey lightweight and the brooding, mortally wounded political animal: Austin Powers vs. Macbeth."" — Washington Post.
Into the Woods
July 2-3 and 5-7 at 8:00pm
Music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim
Book by James Lapine
Directed by Hersh Ellis
Music Direction by Joseph Bricker
Concept art for Into the Woods under direction by Founder Hersh Ellis and music direction by Joseph Bricker.
Everyone's favorite storybook characters are brought together for a timeless yet relevant piece and rare modern classic. The story follows a Baker and his wife who wish to have a child, Cinderella who wishes to attend the King's Festival, and Jack who wishes his cow would give milk. Everyone's wish is granted, but the consequences of their actions return to haunt them later with disastrous results.
Artistic Director Hersh Ellis, who directed last year’s inaugural production of RENT, will re-imagine the staging in this unique production of a poignant and sophisticated classic.Into the Woods will be deconstructed to its core as a story about people finding their way in face of disaster after a seemingly “happily ever after.” This isn’t your cookie-cutter Disney fairy tale.
Appropriate for Middle School and up.
Into the Woodsis a Tony award winning musical for Best Score and Best Book of a musical.
Metamorphoses
July 23-27 at 8:00pm
Written by Mary Zimmerman
Directed by Hersh Ellis and Hailee Windsor
Concept art for Home Grown Theatre Co.'s production of Metamorphoses under the direction of founder Hersh Ellis and Hailee Windsor.
A magical journey into Ovid’s world of transformation and enchantment. In breathtaking images, classic characters from Greek mythology experience love and loss, joy and pain, as the inevitable consequences of their own actions transform them. Metamorphosesconsists of nine thought-provoking vignettes that are sure to dazzle.
Winner of several Tony Awards in 2002.
""Shows that theatre can provide not just escape but sometimes a glimpse of the divine."" - TIME Magazine.
""Entrancing… an evening of almost magical changes, wrought through the unique imagery of Theatre"" -Chicago Tribune.
Metamorphoses is performed in and around a massive pool occupying most of the stage. You have to see this spectacle to believe it. Artistic Director Hersh Ellis (Into the Woods, RENT) and Associate Artistic Director Hailee Windsor (RENT musical staging) will co-direct this production of “epic” proportion.
Appropriate for Middle School and up.

A carefully calculated budget and plan – with room for as much quality as possible.
Running and producing three shows is by no means cheap, but experience has helped us figure out how to minimize costs while giving everyone a high quality production. Numerous expenses have to be accounted for, including the rental of the theater and appropriate equipment, performance rights, insurance, and phone and web hosting bills. Professional and school theatrical companies have the resources and money to have access to all of this easily. Since Home Grown is a non-profit company made up of only students, it just has you. (But we're so incredibly lucky!)
Here is a break down of how much everything will cost and where your money will go:
Theater Rental = $2000
Set: 2 shows = $1000
Royalties for 15 performances = $3075
Into the Woods: $440 x 5 shows = $2200
Metamorphoses: $100 x 5 shows = $500
Frost/Nixon: $75 x 5 shows = $375
Insurance = $250
Web hosting for 1 year = $105
IndieGoGo Fee = $635.94
Total Cost: $7066 
You may have noticed that rehearsal and office space, costumes, props, make-up, print shop fees, and microphones aren't included in this mix. All of these have either been kindly donated to us, or we are reusing them from previous productions.
Stretch Goal
Metamorphoses = $800 +
We have also set up a stretch goal. Should we be fully funded, any additional money donated will go straight into Metamorphoses, our third show of the season. Currently, we have set up the budget so that it will be funded via profits from tickets sales on our first two shows. But if we are able to raise more money now, than more will be available along the road for charity.

Thank you for supporting the future of the arts.


FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
Do I need a Paypal account to contribute?
You will need to make a Paypal account if you wish to contribute using the Paypal option if you don't already have one. Otherwise, you can contribute via credit/debit card automatically.
If Home Grown Theatre Co. is a non-profit 501(c)3 company, does that mean my donations are tax deductible?
Our 501(c)3 status is pending. We are in the process of confirming it, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Please donate and choose one of our great perks instead!
Where does the money from the ticket sales go and how is it used? Or what is Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS?
Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS (BC/EFA) is a nonprofit charitable foundation that uses the American theatre community  to help support people with AIDS and other critical illnesses. For more information about BC/EFA, visit their website at: http://www.broadwaycares.org/.
This company is really run by students with no professionals or teachers?
Yes, and to top it off, most of our team is still in high school. We have a few college students, but the majority of us are under the age of 18. It is the only theatre company in the Kansas City area to do so, and probably one of a few in the entire country. But we can assure you, all of us are extremely motivated and devoted to Theatre, and we wouldn't do this unless we thought we couldn't deliver something of value and worthwhile.
How can I get tickets to a show?
We are working on getting a website up and running. We plan on implementing some sort of online ticketing system soon, while we will also be selling tickets at the door and will accept both cash and credit cards. In the meantime, we suggest our Early Access Perk, which will give you the best chance to get tickets to a show.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>NEW:  Our S-T-R-E-T-C-H goals are here!  Scroll down...</h3>
<h3>UPDATE</h3>
<p>We reached our goal with 28 days left in the campaign!  The amount we wanted to raise was modest and what we felt was attainable -- and we attained it!  The entire cast and company are SO grateful to our generous contributors.</p>
<h3>All funds raised to our goal go to the artists</h3>
<p>Even though we surpassed our goal, ALL the funds raised will still be shared by the artists -- the actors, director, stage manager and playwright of this show, who are all working for free and a share of the modest box office from this festival production.  Surpassing our goal means that we are that much less dependent on the box office for any compensation after rehearsing full time for a month followed by 7 performances over the 10 days of the festival.</p>
<p>Also indiegogo/paypal deducts 9% of your contribution as their fee.  So we really won't have attained our goal until we're 9% past it!</p>
<p>Now that we've achieved a small stipend for the amazing pros who are working on this show by making our original goal, we've set STRETCH goals to entice you to make this production even better than it was going to be.</p>
<h3>Support a World Premiere!</h3>
<p>My name is Sugith Varughese and I'm a produced film and television screenwriter and actor.  Now my first stage play has been accepted by the prestigious Summerworks Theatre Festival in Toronto!</p>
<p>It's a satire about the conflict between my generation and the millenials--the ones who came of age in 2000 and beyond.  It's called ENTITLEMENT.</p>
<p>In the play, an out of work screenwriter takes as job teaching scriptwriting to college kids.  When an ambitious student challenges his methods, the screenwriter has to fight for his job.  It's about the transformation of education to edutainment and the growing power of an entitled generation to assert their will--but at what cost?</p>
<p>As an out of work screenwriter (award-winning!--look me up on imdb.com or wikipedia.org), I taught scriptwriting courses at colleges and the play's inspired by my experiences.</p>
<p>It's funny.  And timely.  I'm thrilled the Summerworks jury thought enough of it to accept the play as part of the 2013 festival.</p>
<p>As fanastic as acceptance into the festival is, it means that I, as well as the director, the actors and other artists involved in the production only get paid from the box office receipts.  And the funds to produce the play must be raised by me.</p>
<p>Being my first play, I will do whatever it takes to produce it at Summerworks.</p>
<p>But I could use some help--which will go DIRECTLY to the actors, director and stage manager who are working for free to put on the play.  Instead of hoping for something out of the box office, once expenses like the props and set get paid for, YOUR HELP will give them some assurance that they aren't working for nothing.</p>
<p>They believe in the play and are donating their time and talent NOW.  Your contribution will modestly compensate them beyond what we might get from the box office during the festival.</p>
<h3>A union-sanctioned show</h3>
<p>The artist members of Canadian Actors' Equity, (the union for stage performers and directors), are working under a festival agreement, which gives them the opportunity to work for free in exchange for an artist share of the box office from the festival.  A fee is paid to CAEA to provide the artists with health insurance for the month leading up to the festival performances, (which must be recoupled from box office receipts, along with all the other expenses before the artists receive any monies.)  We are proud to be members of Equity and are grateful that the festival agreement enables Equity members to work on this kind of show and bring their high levels of professional standards to the production.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I hope I can raise at least $3000 which would be shared by:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 cast members, Dora-winning actress Karen Robinson, seasoned veteran actor Sam Khalilieh and an exciting newcomer Christo Graham</li>
<li>the director, Dora-winning actor and director David Ferry</li>
<li>the stage manager, Michael Sinclair</li>
<li>the playwright and producer, Sugith Varughese (also an award-winning screenwriter and actor)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides supporting the premiere of Entitlement, your contribution will net you some pretty cool perks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a copy of the script, signed by the playwright</li>
<li>a copy of the band Folk Off's CD</li>
<li>access to the secret missing video of someone smoking crack on a Ford</li>
<li>drinks with the cast and playwright</li>
<li>private talkback after the show with the cast and playwright</li>
<li>a private dialogue class with acclaimed director David Ferry</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as the knowledge that your contribution will help support the participation of some of Canada's best theatre artists in the premiere of Entitlement.</p>

<h3>What Your Contribution Means</h3>
<p>Everyone has a story about encountering someone with a sense of entitlement.  It seems like entitlement is the product of our times.  That's what this play is about.</p>
<p>It's a searing satire about the conflict between generations.  We want the over-40 and the under-25 demographic to come.  We want generational brawls to break out in the aisles!  (Not really.)  We want people to either see themselves or see someone they recognize in this play.</p>
<p>Your contribution makes that possible.  The timeliness of this play means that it will have an impact on those who see it.  It's possible that this production may be the first of many, if the play's the success we believe it can be.</p>
<p>And the people behind this play aren't beginners.</p>
<ul>
<li>Director David Ferry has been nominated ten times for DORA awards, winning three times: best actor, best director and a shared best lighting design. He has been nominated for Genie, Gemini and Canadian Comedy Awards, and has won a Nellie for best radio actor, and the inaugural Toronto Drama Critics award for best actor (Blasted.) He was the 2011 recipient of the Barbara Hamilton Award. He has a coveted Harold award.</li>
<li>Karen Robinson has 3 DORA nominations, 1 win - Best Actress; 1 STERLING win (Edmonton) - Best Actress;  Salento Int'l Film Festival (Italy) - Best Actress; NAACP Theatre Award - Best Ensemble; 1 BETTY nomination (Calgary) - Best Actress; 1 GEMINI nomination - Best Supporting Actress; 1 REEL BLACK nomination - Best Actress</li>
<li>Sam Khalilieh is a seasoned actor, veteran of two Summerworks shows, whose stage credits are numerous as well as many film and TV credits.  He can currently be seen on stage in an amazing production of The Passion Play in Toronto</li>
<li>Christo Graham is an exciting newcomer making his Toronto stage debut.  He's also an accomplished musician and he and his band Folk Off will be doing cover versions of rock songs for the show</li>
<li>Sugith Varughese is an award-winning screenwriter of numerous hours of scripted TV, including 10 episodes of the Muppet series Fraggle Rock to episodes of the crime drama Blue Murder.  He won the first York Trillium Award for Most Promising Writer - Television and was appointed the first screenwriter-in-residence for the Toronto Public Library. He is also an actor with 75 credits in film, TV, stage and radio and an award-winning short film director.  He also taught scriptwriting and acting at the college level.</li>
</ul>
<p>But we only get paid out of box office receipts for our show at Summerworks.  </p>
<p>Even if we had sold out houses, each share of the box office would be worth a little over $500 after our expenses are paid.  That's for four weeks of rehearsals and 7 performances during the festival. Not much. Not what artists of this calibre are worth.  They are all professionals and members of Canadian Actors Equity.  </p>
<p>IF this were a regular play, the actors, stage manager and director fees alone would be in excess of $20,000 - at union scale.  That's what these professionals are giving up to do this play.  But that's what doing a festival show means.  The artists give up the normal wage for a chance to do new work that they believe in.</p>
<p>Their passion, talent and commitment is worth more than the box office can provide. So all your contributions will go directly to them.  And we won't have to rely so much on the box office for our compensation.  </p>
<p>We are all excited to be doing this work and the production will be as professional as any regardless of what we get paid.</p>

<h3>NEW!  Our S-T-R-E-T-C-H Goals are here!</h3>

<h3>STRETCH GOAL No. 1:  Colour programs among other things</h3>
<p>We've raised our initial goal of $3000 which will be shared by the artists working on this show, but raising another $500 will enable us to provide colour programs, rather than the xeroxed black and white ones we had budgeted for.  As you can see from the photos included in the Gallery in this campaign, colour makes a difference!</p>
<h3>
<br/>STRETCH GOAL No. 2:  Brand new set furniture</h3>
<p>Often with festival shows, the set is cobbled together from existing pieces or borrowed.  Giving us an extra $500 will give us the ability to purchase the right furniture, (I know it isn't much money for furniture, but thankfully, Ikea will provide some excellent pieces that will be new rather than used.)  The major set piece for the show is a portable white board that flips and that alone is $750 to buy.  The extra funds will enable us to make the show look as good as it can.</p>
<h3>
<br/>STRETCH GOAL No. 3:  Bonus stipends for the other artists</h3>
<p>While the members of Canadian Actors Equity working on the show work for free, there are other artists, like the ridiculously talented assistant director, and the sound/projection designer who receive a small stipend rather than take the risk of sharing in the box office.  The extra funds will go to increase their stipend which, believe me, they've earned!</p>
<h2>Thanks for contributing to ""Entitlement at Summerworks 2013"".  I'm utterly blown away with your generosity and kindness.</h2>
<p>These stretch goals are designed to inspire us to make the best show we can and inspire YOU to share and cajole others who will take us over the top and make the show far better than we had expected it could be.  Tell your friends!  And come to the show and see how we've spent your contributions!</p>

IF this were a regular play, the actors, stage manager and director fees alone would be in excess of $20,000 - at union scale.  That's what these professionals are giving up to do this play.  But that's what doing a festival show means.  The artists give up the normal wage for a chance to do new work that they believe in.
Their passion, talent and commitment is worth more than the box office can provide. So all your contributions will go directly to them.  And we won't have to rely so much on the box office for our compensation.  
We are all excited to be doing this work and the production will be as professional as any regardless of what we get paid.

Late News from Europe
Recently, I learned that the play has been shortlisted by a prestigious theater in Belgium for translation and publication in French!  This is a tremendous vote of confidence in the script and I couldn't be more pleased the text travels across borders.
NEW!  Our S-T-R-E-T-C-H Goals are here!

STRETCH GOAL No. 1:  Colour programs among other things
We've raised our initial goal of $3000 which will be shared by the artists working on this show, but raising another $500 will enable us to provide colour programs, rather than the xeroxed black and white ones we had budgeted for.  As you can see from the photos included in the Gallery in this campaign, colour makes a difference!

STRETCH GOAL No. 2:  Brand new set furniture
Often with festival shows, the set is cobbled together from existing pieces or borrowed.  Giving us an extra $500 will give us the ability to purchase the right furniture, (I know it isn't much money for furniture, but thankfully, Ikea will provide some excellent pieces that will be new rather than used.)  The major set piece for the show is a portable white board that flips and that alone is $750 to buy.  The extra funds will enable us to make the show look as good as it can.

STRETCH GOAL No. 3:  Bonus stipends for the other artists
While the members of Canadian Actors Equity working on the show work for free, there are other artists, like the ridiculously talented assistant director, and the sound/projection designer who receive a small stipend rather than take the risk of sharing in the box office.  The extra funds will go to increase their stipend which, believe me, they've earned!
Thanks for contributing to ""Entitlement at Summerworks 2013"".  I'm utterly blown away with your generosity and kindness.
These stretch goals are designed to inspire us to make the best show we can and inspire YOU to share and cajole others who will take us over the top and make the show far better than we had expected it could be.  Tell your friends!  And come to the show and see how we've spent your contributions!

<p>Dear friend,</p>
<p>As you may already know, I’ve been working on my solo show, <strong><em>Will Work For</em></strong> over a year now in collaboration with Tamilla Woodard. The show was selected for the 10<sup>th</sup> Annual soloNOVA Arts Festival with terraNOVA Collective for its’ world premiere!</p>
<p>The show is based on events in my life after getting laid off during the financial crisis of 2008 and explores the struggles I faced throughout my period of long-term unemployment.  Previously, I’d performed pieces of my original work in <strong><em>SOUL Latina</em></strong> with Latino Flavored Productions Inc., <strong><em>The Faith Project </em></strong>with Tamilla Woodard at Bowery Poetry Club and <strong><em>True Story Project: Faith</em></strong> with Visible Theatre. This is my first full-length solo performance that I’m self-producing.</p>
<p>I’ve been extremely fortunate to have enlisted the help of an amazing creative team: Jo Cattell, Direction; Nathaniel Nicco-Annan, Choreography; Marios Aristopoulos, Sound Design; Chris Marston, Video Projection Design; Heather Anderson, Costume Design, Photos &amp; Illustrations. Right now, I’m in the middle of the rehearsal process and my creative team is inspiring me to discover new ideas for the show every day!</p>
<p>At this stage of development of the show, presenting a full production of the show for the first time in such a prestigious festival and giving my designers the support they need to do their work comes with increased costs that I’m simply not able to manage alone. For example, in addition to the material for the show, I’d like to have my Video Projection Designer videotape the performance for future development and promotion of the show. This won’t be possible without your financial support. Your donation would allow me to realize all the hard work that I’ve been doing for over a year now and showcase the extraordinary work crafted by my collaborators to its’ fullest potential. This will help to make the soloNOVA Festival just the first stop in the show’s ultimate on-going success.</p>

I'm a professional vocalist (BET ""Jazz Vocalist of the Year""
2000; SouthArts ""Esteemed Southern Artist"" 2006; Nashville Jazz Workshop Heritage Award for 'Artistic Excellence', 2013)  and actress  performing and promoting our national treasure  -  jazz.  My team and I are working to raise $25,000.00 to cover 1/4 of our budget needs for artistic collaboration, community outreach and phase 2 re-boot for , ""Jazz Rhapsody...A Southern Songbird's Tribute To The Legacy of Jazz""
OUR GOAL:  is to relaunch this ""outstanding"" show in spring of 2014 for our fans and friends in the Middle Tennessee Area then continue from there to collaborate with universities, colleges and community venues across the southeast in a series of mini-tours.After premiering in Nashville in
2006, gaining superb audience response at all performance stops along the initial leg of our journey, including: Cumberland University, Hiawassee College, Wisconsin Lutheran College, Martin Methodist College and Indiana Wesleyan University, events forced us into hiatus in 2008. Now, we're
back and working hard once again to ""get this show on the road"", sharing and honoring the musical legacy of artists like Duke Ellington, Bill Strayhorn, Billie Holiday, Alberta Hunter, Langston Hughes and others whose artistry helped shape our cultural landscape. Your generous, tax-deductible contributions will help us keep jazz a living
force within full reach of the next generation... by helping to put ""Jazz Rhapsody...A Southern Songbird's Tribute To The Legacy of Jazz""
 back into the visible
market - allowing us to showcase and collaborate with artists in other 
regions.  Your support will help put us in the places where college, 
university and community arts
presenters go to find quality arts and cultural enhancement projects to 
bring to
their students and surrounding communities. 
AS THE CROWN JEWEL OF AMERICAN CULTURAL HERITAGE, JAZZ IS AN AMERICAN TREASURE~  WORTHY OF CELEBRATED HONOR, RENEWED 
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND MARKET VISIBILITY.  Such is the seed and purpose of the""Jazz
Rhapsody"" Project.Our goal is to redevelop and tour
""Jazz Rhapsody..."" in a series of short (3 month) celebration tours - engaging college, university and community performing arts groups in
collaboration as we tour the show...ultimately expanding the outreach and impact of jazz music through this unique fusion
of live jazz, spoken-word & theatre....  or 'jazz theatre' as we like to call it.We need your help - to honor and promote the crown jewel of American cultural heritage...Jazz.  Help us grow our collaboration and outreach opportunities for ""Jazz Rhapsody...A Southern Songbird's Tribute To The Legacy of Jazz"".""A truly masterful performance, and equally masterful work of creative artistry.""    Lou Outlaw, Vanderbilt University;  Board Member, National Museum of African American Music
What We Need & What You Get
We're seeking to raise 25,000.00 - approximately one fourth (1/4) of our redevelopment and touring budget - to cover costs related to creating collaboration, performance and showcasing opportunities. These costs include:
Updates to promotion and marketing materials, incl. videotaping & editing

Rehearsal space rental fees 
Rehearsal/arranging fees to musicians 

Administrative & production assistance fees

Showcasing and booth rental fees at regional and national conferences
Collaboration fees, incl. postage, travel to meetings, stipends

<p>Nine years ago I saw Nick Whitby's play ""To the Green Fields Beyond"" directed by Sam Mendes at the Donmar Warehouse and fell immediately in love with it.</p>
<p>Back then I was a busy actress toying with the idea of becoming a theatre director. A few years later, through passion, motivation and hard work, I established myself as an exciting new director committed to promoting fresh ideas, new writing, and talented actors. Since falling in love with ‘Green Fields’, I read the play at least once a year, trying to figure out how I could produce it so that the Italian audiences could discover and fall in love with it like I did.</p>
<p>Although I didn’t have a producer or a production company behind me, I was determined to secure the rights to the play in the hope to share ‘Green Fields’ with the Italian audiences. So I contacted the play’s author, Nick Whitby (through his company True West), and thanks to his support I was able to secure the rights for 3 years. Francesca Silveri and I translated and adapted the play, which received Nick’s seal of approval. He thinks an Italian production of his wonderful play would be very interesting indeed. I have looked for a production company who would share my passion and with the means to bring my artistic vision of ‘Green Fields’ to the stage for the past 3 years, but I’ve not found it yet.</p>
<p>Mine is not only a case of financial limitation. The Italian theatrical panorama is very different from the one in the UK. Big venues can afford to pay for expensive productions (which includes buying the rights to the plays), reserving the right to any artistic decision. This, more often than not, limits creativity and certainly does not allow emerging directors to prove their worth. Because of the difficulties involved in this process, all the big theatres in Italy often stage the Classics. It’s down to the people who love the theatre to change this trend that is eating away, or even obliterating, Italy’s artistic heart.</p>
<p>The rights are about to expire but I decided that since I began this endavour on my own, I will also see it through on my own. Nick Whitby and Rachel Fisher from True West have given me extraodirnay support over the past 3 years. The same can be said about Francesca Silveri and all the actors who have been behind me in my search for a production company. They've followed the ups and downs without ever losing hope that sooner, rather than later, I will be able to stage a production of this beautiful play.</p>

<h2><strong>Perchè Siamo Qui<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Nove anni fa al Donmar Warehouse di Londra ho visto questo bellissimo testo di Nick Whitby con la regia di Sam Mendes e me ne sono innamorata. L'ho letto e riletto, anno dopo anno, pensando a come produrlo in modo che anche in Italia potessero conoscerlo e innamorarsene come me.</p>
<p>Nel 2009, da sola, senza una produzione alle spalle, mi sono messa in contatto con lo stesso Whitby tramite il suo legale Rachel Fisher, e con il loro prezioso supporto ho chiuso un accordo che mi ha dato l'esclusiva del testo in Italia per 3 anni. La traduzione fatta con  Francesca Silveri ha ottenuto la piena approvazione di Nick (che ama molto l'Italia, e sarebbe felicissimo di vedere il suo testo rappresentato in italiano) e ha raccolto le adesioni degli attori del mio ""cast ideale"" (potete vederlo nella ""Gallery""), riempiendomi di gioia e entusiasmo.</p>
<p>Ho passato gli ultimi 3 anni a cercare una produzione adeguata all'importanza del testo. Ne ho anche trovate, ma per un motivo o per l'altro non abbiamo mai chiuso. Tanti complimenti, tanto interesse, tanto supporto e incoraggiamento, ma niente produzione; ""troppi attori"", pare. Tutti pronti a ospitare lo spettacolo nei loro teatri ma non a produrlo.</p>
<p>I diritti stanno per scadere ma io ho deciso: ho cominciato da sola e andrò avanti da sola. Amo troppo questo progetto e le persone che ne fanno parte per lasciarmi scoraggiare dagli ingranaggi dell'obsoleta macchina produttiva italiana. Il supporto di Nick e di Rachel in questi anni è stato eccezionale, come quello di Francesca e di tutti gli attori che hanno seguito con me le vicissitudini produttive non perdendo mai le speranze di mettere in scena questo bellissimo testo.</p>
<p>Spero vogliate aiutarci anche voi. Un vostro contributo, anche minimo, sarà importantissimo per noi. Tanti piccoli, singoli, passi, compongono un lungo cammino.</p>

<h2>La Storia Che Vogliamo Raccontare</h2>
<p>""<em>To the Green Fields Beyond (Oltre I Verdi Campi)</em>"" di Nick Withby, autore inglese contemporaneo, è andato in scena per la prima volta al Donmar Warehouse di Londra, con la regia di Sam Mendes e la partecipazione tra gli altri di Dougray Scott, Ray Winstone e Hugh Dancy. Basato su fatti reali e ambientato durante la Grande Guerra, il testo racconta la storia dell'equipaggio multietnico di un carro armato inglese, la notte prima di un attacco in territorio francese. Gli otto uomini, capeggiati dal carismatico Tenente Child, vengono a conoscenza di qualcosa che li porterà a discutere tutta la notte tra loro per prendere una decisione cruciale: fare il loro dovere e morire, oppure disertare e salvarsi. Ognuno di essi porta nel confronto il proprio vissuto, la propria filosofia, la propria religione; offrendo così sulla vita, la morte e la guerra punti di vista diversissimi tra loro ma estremamente attuali nella ricerca di un ""senso"" a tutto questo. A dare ulteriori elementi di attualità al testo è la presenza di un giornalista americano, giunto sul fronte in cerca della ""grande verità"" sulla guerra. E’ una voce fuori dal coro, la voce della ""giovane"" America (non entrata ancora nel conflitto) contrapposta a quella della ""vecchia"" Europa, e in questa ricerca si scontrerà non poco con la realtà della prima linea e degli uomini che la vivono. I ""campi verdi"" del titolo rappresentano per i protagonisti una sorta di soglia da varcare, una meta che li aspetta e che rappresenta il loro destino, l’ultimo luogo da attraversare sulla terra, un luogo di morte proiettato verso un ""oltre"" sconosciuto, oltre il campo di battaglia. ""Green Fields"" è infatti il termine che indica la fine dell’ultima esercitazione dell’equipaggio, e la frase ""To the green fields beyond"" risuona prima dell’epilogo come un comando militare pronunciato insieme da tutti e otto gli uomini. Una speranza di vita cui fa riferimento il colore verde, contrapposto al marrone del fango da cui provengono, e al rosso del sangue attraverso cui devono passare. Ciascun membro dell’equipaggio infatti, indossa una fascia intorno al braccio di colore marrone, rosso e verde il cui significato verrà svelato solo alla fine dell'opera.</p>

<h3>About COWBOY MOUTH </h3>
<p>by Sam Shephard &amp; Patti Smith</p>
<p>Two misfits, Slim and Cavale, are holed up in what seems to be a basement apartment. Cavale has kidnapped Slim from his wife and child with big plans to turn him into a Rock Star. <em>Cowboy Mouth</em> is Sam Shepard's most auto-biographical play and was written with Patti Smith at the Chelsea Hotel. This production starts off as a party and transforms into a visceral, immersive performance equipped with drinks and live music.  </p>

<p>The Dancing with
Class (DwC) All-Stars program provides professional ballroom dance
instruction and performance opportunities to middle school students from across
Chicago, with an emphasis on reaching kids who live in under-resourced
communities. As schools continue to face budget cuts and closures, innovative
programs that provide social support and development are increasingly urgent.
The DwC All-Stars offers a unique solution by expanding access to an art form
and social activity that inherently builds <b><span><em>leadership skills</em></span></b>, <strong><i>self-confidence </i></strong>and <strong><i>tolerance</i></strong>.</p>

<p><em></em>It allows 65 young professional dancers and choreographers from a diversity of countries and backgrounds the possibility to continue an intense multinational professional training program while being provided with space, time, resources and mentorship to develop and exhibit their artistic work in the field of Contemporary Dance and Performance. Moreover it provides the opportunity to develop important networks with artists from all over the world. ImPulsTanz is the largest international Dance Festival in Europe, and thus one of the best places to develop future international collaborations and networking for young artists.  Two artistic mentors and renowned international choreographers <strong>Benoît Lachambre &amp; Robin Poitras</strong>, will facilitate our choreographic work.  Impulsetanz is essentially a gathering of creative thinkers, performers, dancers, teachers, and theorists in the fields of contemporary dance and performances. </p>

<p><strong>Participating in the danceWEB program is a tremendous opportunity for me, providing space, time and mentorship for artistic exploration, collaboration and growth.

<h3><strong>Why do I need to raise money if I have already been awarded a scholarship??</strong></h3>
<p>Dear friends I am asking for your support to make this dance project possible for me. In order to participate in this danceWEB programme this summer 2012, I need to secure<strong> 1/3 of the scholarship ($ 2,850)</strong>.  The European Commission as well as several Austrian funding organizations will fund the remaining 2/3 of the expenses. In addition to the tuition cost, I will be providing my own personal funding for airfare and meal expenses for the duration of 5 weeks. </p>
<p>There are very few resources for emerging artists and their professional development in the US, as well as in Spain where I currently live.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Therefore I must rely on private donations from family, friends, and wonderful supporters like you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This funding needs to be provided by July 1st, 2012.</strong></p>
<p>Thus I am in need of $2850 to cover my expenses and make this project a reality. With your support I will be able to complete the amount needed so that I can attend danceWEB this summer!!!</p>
<p><strong>Any amount you can contribute helps! </strong></p>

<h3><strong>A bit about me: </strong></h3>
<p>I am a young artist committed to and interested in working outside of the commercialized arts sector, using the creative and performance process to explore, reflect on, question and comment on issues and themes that touch our contemporary society and the human being in its diversity.  I am interested in <strong>inventing alternative realities</strong> on stage as well as through interventions in urban spaces through the use of poetic multi-sensorial languages that allow us to communicate, collaborate with, and provoke the audience as well as those engaged in the creative process. </p>
<p>Over the past few years I have been fortunate to get to <strong>work and play</strong> creating, collaborating, and performing in diverse international projects in France, Spain, Denmark, Russia, Germany, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, India and the United States.  I have witnessed and experienced how the artistic process transforms lives and communities; the creative process allows each and every human being (who participates as performer or active spectator) to explore, express, communicate and generate a dialogue between our inner subjective and outer objective worlds.  </p>
<p><strong>What moves and shakes me up?</strong> How can we explore and transcend dominant social structures, represenations and images of the body, and the culture of fear and anxiety within our contemporary society through dance and performance processes?</p>
<p>Let’s mutually enter into a constantly conscious state of questioning, transgression, and intercommunication: provoking emotions and using bodies as a point of interaction, points of departure, a permeable quality that exchanges energy, intelligence, sensations, and narratives.</p>
<p> I am diving into an exploration of how to use my creative artistic process to transform dominant vertical social relations into horizontal spaces of critically conscious playful and rebellious exchange: here movement, touch, breath and voice allows one to permeate frontiers of the body, sharing and exchanging energy, meaning, and sense of humanity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alongside the creative process, productions, and artistic collaborations, I am committed to developing methods and techniques to provide what I believe to be a pertinent experimental performing arts education to children, adolescents and adults. I am concerned with increasing access to quality performing arts education in particular in respects to marginalized populations in cities/towns.  Over the last years I have witnessed how dance , physical theater, and performance practices develop body mind awareness, our human creative empathetic capacities, as well as our multi-sensorial somatic capacities. Building and developing self esteem and our sense of solidarity through performing arts practices we are able to exchange experiences, knowledge and our diverse visions of the world through our multiples intelligences and generic human creative capacity to respond our environment and struggle for human dignity, regardless of how oppressive, disfunctional, and fractured this reality may be.</p>

I am a dancer and choreographer,  who was born in Russia, grew up and trained on the East Coast of the U.S (at Concord Acadmey and Connecticut College), and is currently based in Sevilla, Spain. 
I have recently received a great honor:   I am one of 65 artists selected to receive a danceWEB scholarship, out of an applicant pool of over 1023 dancers and choreographers worldwide. It's a very important recognition of my work as an emerging artist in contemporary dance and a life-changing opportunity for me. 
 

DanceWEB is essentially a 5-week week residency program, within the frame of ImPulsTanz - Vienna international Dance Festival, taking place in July/August. 


It allows 65 young professional dancers and choreographers from a diversity of countries and backgrounds the possibility to continue an intense multinational professional training program while being provided with space, time, resources and mentorship to develop and exhibit their artistic work in the field of Contemporary Dance and Performance. Moreover it provides the opportunity to develop important networks with artists from all over the world. ImPulsTanz is the largest international Dance Festival in Europe, and thus one of the best places to develop future international collaborations and networking for young artists.  Two artistic mentors and renowned international choreographers Benoît Lachambre & Robin Poitras, will facilitate our choreographic work.  Impulsetanz is essentially a gathering of creative thinkers, performers, dancers, teachers, and theorists in the fields of contemporary dance and performances.

<h3>WHY THESE SHOWS MATTER</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>  LRT has taken this season and dedicated it to not only promoting diversity in our artists and in the performing arts but to producing shows about individuals who are facing prejudice  for just being a little different than those around them. We are all young artists and many of us have faced bullying growing up for not quite fitting in with our peers and this has had a profound effect on all of us at LRT. These shows are important because whether  comedies or dramas they are about people overcoming bullying and intolerance. Theater is such a powerful and immediate art form where each performance is a special and unique experience shared only once by the performers and the audience. As the cost of a broadway ticket rises the attendance especially of young people who cannot afford a broadway ticket decreases. We want to bring these important quality productions to people who might otherwise not have a chance or the money to see a show. Please help us encourage young artists, and people of all ages to support the performing arts and support the important messages in these productions! </p>

WHAT IT IS:

Mickey & Sage - a play by Sara Farrington 

Mickey & Sage is Sara Farrington's inaugural full-length production in her very own Brooklyn performance space, Foxy Films. 
January 20th-29th, 2012 @ 8pm 
Foxy Films Performance Space
170 Tillary St., Brooklyn NY


More on Mickey & Sage...

Mickey & Sage is a disturbing play, disguised in a funny play. It explores childhood fear and how kids misinterpret the world. Mickey is an aggressive little 11-year old played pitch-perfectly by Jack Frederick. Sage is a hyper-active 9-year-old played scintillatingly by Erin Mallon. Mickey & Sage have been thrust into a terrifying world, thanks to two very bad parents and one very strange neighbor, Harvey, played ever-so-delicately by Don Carter. 

The great thing about Mickey & Sage is that the always audience gets it, but the kids never do. It's really fun.

WHAT I NEED:

I finally don't need to pay for rehearsal or performance space! Yes!
But here's where I'm looking for help with financing:
Actor fees, including weekly rehearsal and performance pay (for a 6 performance run.)
Designer fee, including a stipend for my set designer.
Basic set pieces, including a picket fence and slamming screen door.
Props.
Wine and refreshments for during the show.


WHAT I HOPE TO ACHIEVE (WITH YOUR HELP!):
With your help, I hope to make Foxy Films a fully functioning theater that exists solely to produce my and my fellow playwright's work and very little cost to them or you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I am Colleen Ross, or B-girl Bean. I have been break dancing since 2000 and I have helped organize break dance competitions since 2007. My goal is to bring positive, uplifting hip hop events to communities around the Seattle area.</p>
<p>Queen vs Queen is an event which will occur in the Seattle area on August 11th. It is a partnership between 206 Zulu Malikas, Northwestbgirls.com and The City of Burien. It will include a 1 on 1 b-girl invitational competition, 2 on 2 open break dance competition, 3 on 3 open all-styles competition, street dance workshops and performances.</p>
<p>Contributing to Queen vs Queen will aid in the mission to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Raise Awareness</strong> of the strength and diversity of females in the male domniated break dancing scene.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advocate</strong> for women's stories to be heard and unique styles expressed through invite competitions, show, ventors and workshops.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unite</strong> through a celebration of street dance styles with a female focus.</li>
<li>
<strong>Create</strong> an annual event presence to inspire girls and women to join the break dance scene and for the level of competition to continue to increase to include dancers from around the world. </li>
</ul><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The budget for Queen vs Queen is $3140. Here's the break down:</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>$500: Airfare assistance for b-girls who need a little help. Most dancers get between $50-$75 assistance.</li>
<li>$100: Transportation to get visiting dancers to and from the event and airport.</li>
<li>$300: 3 Workshop Teachers, each teaching a FREE workshop, open to the whole community.</li>
<li>$250: Compensation for 5 judges for all-styles and 5 judges for break dancing.</li>
<li>$400: Compensation for 2 djs, the female DJ travels from Las Vegas to be a part of this event.</li>
<li>$80: Compensation for 2 hosts.</li>
<li>$300: Housing for visiting dancers.</li>
<li>$1000: Cash Prizes are divided between 1st and 2nd place winners of all competitions.</li>
<li>$160: Thank you gifts for all the women who travel to Queen vs Queen to compete, dj, host, and judge.</li>
<li>$50: Posters and flyers to promote the event.</li>
</ul></ul><p>Awesome Perks for funding Queen vs Queen include: Your name on event shirt, a personal dance class and personalized thank you photo!</p>
<p>If the entire buget is covered I will be able to make Queen vs Queen more accessable to the community by making it a FREE event. If not, a small fee of $5-$10 will be charged at the door.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding for this project allow me to not only hold a high quality and low cost event, it allows me to invite and help dancers who would not otherwise be able to afford this trip.</p>
<p>The event, Queen vs Queen, is not an end in inself. The goal is to draw a large group of female dancers together to connect, grow and recognize that they are not alone. These dancers are then able to go out into their communities and help younger female dancers develop and compete right along with male dancers. The goal is a celebration of female talent to inspire more connect and growth in the hip hop community.</p>
<p>The local b-girl group, Northwest B-girls, has already started to feel the impact of this a growing b-girl community. Through competing together, practicing together as well as performances this group has been growing and building the abilities and confidence of b-girls in Seattle.</p>
<p>A qualifier for 2 invite spots in Queen vs Queen was help in Shoreline, WA this May. This event was FREE and open to the community through a partnership with The City of Shoreline Teen Program. This event included 10 female competitors and 5 female judges. Competitors came from as far as Calgary, Canada and Portland, Oregon. The excitement at this event showed the desire and hunger b-girls have to be a part of this event and to celebrate b-girling. </p>

<p>A lot of you probably already know the answer to this, but for those of you who don't, a staged reading is the step between writing a play and a full production. Actors are brought in to read the lines aloud, sometimes accompanied by small amounts of action, in order to give the playwrights and directors a sense of what still needs to change in the script and give them ideas about how to stage the full production. It also gives the playwrights a chance to interact directly with actors and an audience in order to get their opinions on the roles and lines they have created, which is why this staged reading will feature an optional talk-back session at the end for attendees to voice their opinions and ask questions.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Where Will All the Money Go?</h3> <p>In order to maintain a professional level of performance, it takes a lot of manpower, blood, sweat, tears, paper, and money.</p>

It also gives the playwrights a chance to interact directly with actors and an audience in order to get their opinions on the roles and lines they have created, which is why this staged reading will feature an optional talk-back session at the end for attendees to voice their opinions and ask questions.   Where Will All the Money Go? In order to maintain a professional level of performance, it takes a lot of manpower, blood, sweat, tears, paper, and money.
Here's what we need:

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Theatre SKAM, one of Victoria’s top alternative theatre companies, is presenting the long awaited premiere of its homage to the ‘grandmother of all fans’, Joan Mans, this March 17<sup>th</sup> through 26<sup>th</sup>, 2017 as part of the Belfry Theatre’s Spark Festival.</p>

<p>For over thirty years, Joan attended arts happenings in Victoria, finishing most evenings at Swan’s Pub, dancing to live music.

<p>Joining Matthew Payne onstage will be Lynda Raino and Treena Stubel, and a chorus of students from SKAM Studios' Children's Ensemble, and members and friends of Victoria’s The Choir, led by Choir Leader Marc Jenkins. <i>Joan</i> has brought together community across disciplines and ages to honour and celebrate a woman who embraced the rich and vibrant arts of Victoria, like no other.</p>

<h3>Mixed Revues and Quills</h3>
<p>I love the theater, and do all I can to promote and improve it in and around Atlanta. I've acted in and directed everything from silly Ray Cooney farces to Shakespeare to contemporary and classic works like The Lady From Dubuque to A Streetcar Named Desire. But there are some shows that no community theaters and very few professionals will put on - either because their content pushes the envelope of local mores, or because they just don't have the box office draw. And yet many of these shows are important, and need to be performed. I started Mixed Revues as a way to bring these works to the Atlanta stage.<br/><br/>Doug Wirght's <em>Quills</em> is a perfect example of this type of work. Powerful, obscenity laden and blasphemous, it boasts full frontal nudity, bloody special effects and far beyond adult themes, But <em>Quills</em> is about more than simply the shock it can produce. It explores the boundaries between total artistic freedom and the responsibility an artist takes to his audience and society at large for the results of that expression. It exposes the tolls taken on the artist by the polar opposites of censureship and unfettered expression - tinted by love, religion, compassion and man's ultimate cruelty to his fellows.<br/><br/>Mixed Revues is the smallest possible theater company. It consists of myself as the Artistic Director, and whomever I can rope into each performance. Some of the company are repeats from previous shows, some new for each one. There is no board, no bylaws, no restrictions - also, no theater,no season subscribers, no sponsors and very little money. Pure artistic freedom always comes with a cost. No theatrical company can exist on ticket sales alone, and this is doubley true for groups that eschew the tried and true popular shows. And so, we reach out to you for help.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We're hoping to crowd-source $5000 for this production, and as a seed for the next. Here's some of out actual anticipated expenses:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><br/>Theater Rental - 7 Stages Blackbox $3,000<br/>Rehearsal Space $800<br/>Royaltees and Scripts $650<br/>Costumes and props $500<br/>Sets and special effects $400<br/>Marketing and printing $250<br/><br/>Subtotal: $5,600</p>
<p><br/>We'll make up the shortfall with ticket sales, which will also go toward cast and crew stipends and a myriad of ongoing administrative and miscellaneous expenses. If there's anything left over, it will go toward the next production in the spring of 2014.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What We Give Back</h3>
<p><br/>In addition to our undying gratitude, Mixed Revues offers a number of perks for your generous donations.

</div></div>","Mixed Revues and Quills
I love the theater, and do all I can to promote and improve it in and around Atlanta. I've acted in and directed everything from silly Ray Cooney farces to Shakespeare to contemporary and classic works like The Lady From Dubuque to A Streetcar Named Desire. But there are some shows that no community theaters and very few professionals will put on - either because their content pushes the envelope of local mores, or because they just don't have the box office draw. And yet many of these shows are important, and need to be performed. I started Mixed Revues as a way to bring these works to the Atlanta stage.Doug Wirght's Quills is a perfect example of this type of work. Powerful, obscenity laden and blasphemous, it boasts full frontal nudity, bloody special effects and far beyond adult themes, But Quills is about more than simply the shock it can produce. It explores the boundaries between total artistic freedom and the responsibility an artist takes to his audience and society at large for the results of that expression. It exposes the tolls taken on the artist by the polar opposites of censureship and unfettered expression - tinted by love, religion, compassion and man's ultimate cruelty to his fellows.Mixed Revues is the smallest possible theater company. It consists of myself as the Artistic Director, and whomever I can rope into each performance. Some of the company are repeats from previous shows, some new for each one. There is no board, no bylaws, no restrictions - also, no theater,no season subscribers, no sponsors and very little money. Pure artistic freedom always comes with a cost. No theatrical company can exist on ticket sales alone, and this is doubley true for groups that eschew the tried and true popular shows. And so, we reach out to you for help.
What We Need
We're hoping to crowd-source $5000 for this production, and as a seed for the next. Here's some of out actual anticipated expenses:
Theater Rental - 7 Stages Blackbox $3,000Rehearsal Space $800Royaltees and Scripts $650Costumes and props $500Sets and special effects $400Marketing and printing $250Subtotal: $5,600
We'll make up the shortfall with ticket sales, which will also go toward cast and crew stipends and a myriad of ongoing administrative and miscellaneous expenses. If there's anything left over, it will go toward the next production in the spring of 2014.

What We Give Back
In addition to our undying gratitude, Mixed Revues offers a number of perks for your generous donations. Most of these come in the form of acknowledgement and / or advertising on our web sites and in the program. We've also got half price tickets to any Mixed Revues show. Plus, signed copies of the paperback thriller ""Chaos Theories"" from Mixed Revue's artistic director Stephen Banks.

<h3>GRAYSCALE launches in New York City!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As my company begins it's next chapter as <strong>GRAYSCALE</strong> we have been invited to premier a new duet titled <i>These Small Infinite Terrains</i> on the East Coast as part of Erin Gottwald/e.g. dance  Out-of-Towners Guest Series in Downtown Brooklyn October 26th and 27th and on the West Coast in Santa Barbara November 9 and 10th.  This duet, with an original score by Los Angeles based Litronix, will be performed by Heidi Brewer and Tess Goodrich in NYC, and by Tess Goodrich and Megan Seagren in SB.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Your Donation Covers</strong></h3>
<p>We need your help making these performances a reality!  All funds raised will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artist Travel</li>
<li>Artist Compensation</li>
<li>Costume Design and Construction</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>This will be the first time we have performed in New York City since 2012 and we are thrilled to be once again generously presented by Erin Gottwald!! </p>
<ul>
<li>Through her series, Erin has provided out of town artists (many of whom where once NYC'ers) the opportunity to share these evenings together, cultivate connections in other cities across the US, and expose each other to dance happening nationwide.</li>
<li>Over the years I have enjoyed my connection to the dance community in Santa Barbara.  I feel strongly that it is a city that supports the artistic process and fostering that within smaller dance companies.  It is always a pleasure to present work there, and I am grateful in to be invited by my friend Tracy Kofford.  </li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Your support at any amount will greatly assist our growth as a small dance company.  I fund my work solely out of pocket, and through your generous donations I will be able to take advantage of these opportunities extended to us; which will continue to create exposure for the work we make and grow our connections nationally. </p>
<p>Less than 10% of the average U.S. arts non-profit's funding comes from federal, state, or local government support. The rest comes from ticket sales, private foundations, corporate sponsors, and individual donors (like you!) - Independent and/or emerging artists like myself may not have the visibility to generate high ticket sales or garner grants and partnerships. Therefore, individual donors are critical for our growth.</p>
<p>With your support, I will be able to bring my company and this work to new audiences and new cities - both of which will foster growth for myself as an artist and as for the company at large.</p>

<h3><strong>Who We Are + What We Do</strong></h3>
<p>Dragon's Eye Theatre makes theatrical adventures for the children of Philadelphia and the adults who love them. Our work celebrates the wildness of children's imaginations and the child in everyone. We partner with Philadelphia community spaces that are not typically performance venues to offer frequent visitors a chance to discover new stories in spaces they already know and love by creating original, interactive plays inspired by those spaces, while also attracting new visitors.</p>
<p>We created our plays <i>Seek &amp; Hide</i> and <i>A Mystery? </i>for Philadelphia treasure Smith Memorial Playground &amp; Playhouse, finding all sorts of surprising stories within the toys and architecture that are beloved by so many families. Our most recent adventure, <i>Follow Me Through the Gates</i>, whisked audiences inside the action of the colorful <i>Four Seasons</i> mural that covers the walls of the Independence Branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>Now it’s time for us to start making something brand new!</strong> A new journey that gives kids and their adults a chance to move, think, giggle, build, and use their imaginations together. To see the world from different perspectives, playing with characters who look and talk like they do and characters who don't. To listen to new stories and to share their own.</p>

</div></div>","Forty-years after the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, ABORTION is still a dirty word.  You've seen a lot of talk about this in the news lately, but how many times have you heard the personal stories associated with this hot button issue?
 
That's what The A-is-for-Abortion Play is all about.
 
5 women, 15 characters, one dirty little secret. This political issue is about to get a personal voice, and it has a sick sense of humor. You know a woman who has had one—they just haven’t told you yet.
 
The play has it's WORLD PREMIERE at this year's New York International Fringe Festival.

PERFORMANCES: WED. 8/14 @ 2:00 pm; SAT., 8/17 @7:45pm; MON., 8/19 @ 6:45pm; WED., 8/21 @ 5:15pm; SUN., 8/25 @ 2:15pm
FringeNYC Venue #16: The Robert Moss Theater @ 440 Studios
And, we need your help!
We're raising $3,000 to help support the production of the show. What does it go to?  Well...



Costumes
Props
Actor Stipends
Creative team stipends
Marketing and PR

By helping us get this show off the ground, you'll be saying: 'No More!' No more of women not being able to express their right to have a say over their bodies and their heathcare.  And,  you'll also be saying 'Yes!' to female-driven works of theater.


Even if we don't raise all of the funds, every little bit contributed goes toward making this show a success.
You may also notice the goal is actually $3,270... this includes the fees associated with IndieGoGo and will ensure that we walk away with the $3,000 we need to produce the show.

<p>Our ""Adopt an Artist"" campaigns highlight artists working and living in Montana. This particular campaign directly highlights the work of those often behind the scenes. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>HaltForce's most recent performance project was a two weekend event helping host a <a href=""http://arcamontanadancecollective.com/events"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BRAND NEW Billings dance company</a> in a black box studio that required a full weekend install. We also hosted choreographer and artistic director Joy French of <strong><a href=""http://barebaitdance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bare Bait Dance</a>.  </strong>Dave was inspired by the technical requirements of her evening length work, <strong>DANCE | words | DANCE</strong> and the software that managed it from a single platform.</p>
<p><strong>Whatever is raised will go directly to Dave</strong>; the benefit is that we support an artist in his trade, elevate the opportunity for Dave <strong>to offer the performing arts community a dynamic tech design, and support the artists traveling to Billings who share their art with us.</strong> This is a community investment.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The upgrades facilitate running complex shows without the need for multiple operators or highly skilled operators. They combine audio, lighting, and projection control into one work surface. <strong>They will also be used to train a new generation of theater technicians in the art of show production</strong> and education outreach, which will include: Nova theater, Senior High Theater, and  more to come. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Billings does not have a deep reserve of sound and light technicians for smaller venue performances and it's the same through out the state. Lighting and sound design is often a profession that isn't sustainable in Montana for many.<strong> It's time to invest in the professional upgrades to better accommodate this part of our art community in Billings. </strong></p>

<p>Travel to 1849 where, Monsieur Levesque, a charming young emigre, invites you to partake in a seance; are you a skeptic or a believer? What will you do to stop an aggressive spirit? While exploring a real 19th century mansion you will be relied upon to collect stories, clues and ultimately decide the fate of one young woman who is either gifted or tormented by the spirits around her. Every night is unique because every audience is unique.</p>
<p><br/>Love to investigate? Look into our perks to see how you can join us, get a private tour of the house, get a private show with a real life mentalist or go spirit hunting for real with a professional paranormal researcher.</p>
<p>Show Dates: Fridays and Saturdays at 8pm October 5th through November 2nd</p>
<p>Location: The Cotting Smith Assembly House, Salem MA</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SALEM, OCTOBER 1849</strong></h2>
<p>Indulge yourself in the early Victorian period with a night of secrets, spirits, seances and scandals. While you roam this historic house, uniquely converted by Samuel McIntire, you will get to know the intimate secrets of some of Salem’s most interesting and famous residents, how will you use your information to help some and harm others? There are infinite paths in a house of Smoke and Mirrors</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">BUT WAIT, WHAT’S GAME THEATRE?</h3>
<p>You may have heard of immersive theatre through shows like <i>Sleep No More</i>, <i>And Then She Fell</i> or experiences like Meow Wolf where the audience is inside the show, but what is Game Theatre you ask?</p>
<p>Game theatre is a step deeper into immersion. Intramersive developed game theatre back in 2017 when we took immersive theater and live action role playing and combined the two to create immersive, playable experiences where the audience has the same agency as the characters and the end of story is in your hands. You step into our world as a member of it, you do not need to invent a character, your personality is enough. Our characters bring you in as though you always belonged, entrust you with their secrets, and ask you for your unbiased opinions. When you participate in our world, your actions have consequences, your decisions mean something, the ending is up to you to make happen.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHERE DOES ALL YOUR MONEY GO?</h3>
<p>Meeting you halfway! We are already halfway funded thanks to the support of the Peabody Essex Museum. We have already covered artistic stipends, the cost of the venue and marketing. So what’s left you might ask? Well...</p>
<p>You get to come in at the fun part. If you love costumes, furniture, props, magic, tech crew, support staff, lighting, sound and special effects, then you are on the right team! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565928661/jibletpgvlwvk1zwgabu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The drawing room inside the Cotting Smith Assembly House, 2019</p>
<p>We are asking for $18,000 because, while we have the whole mansion to ourselves, it’s curated by a museum so we can’t really let you sit on the furniture, climb on the tables (as you do sometimes), go through the jewelry boxes (did no one teach you manners?!?). So it's been cleared out and we need you to help us fill it! We are going to get furniture you can lay down on, sit on, climb on, and riffle through. Not to mention some seriously creepy taxidermy (I mean it is the Victorian times) and some lifelike dead things under glass (fake dead things, well, fake mostly dead things...).</p>
<p>Additionally, and surprisingly to our returning Daemonologists, we also have access to electricity so we want to take full advantage of tricking out the lights, playing with sound and in general making the place feel as luscious and unsettling as possible. </p>
<p>We are also excited to be able to work with local, talented artists who will help make some of these props and costumes. Funding this show helps fund the greater creative economy because we love to work with local shops, artists and vendors.  </p>
<p>Your funds will help make the world of <i>Smoke and Mirrors </i>one in which you can engage all five of your senses (or six, you do you).  </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565928151/x8l7cirdrvxycj4zmkcu.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Daemonologie: Smoke and Mirrors is the third installment of the Daemonologie Series produced by Intramersive Media, an immersive game theater company based in Salem MA.

We have collaborated with numerous organizations as well as produced 5 original shows since our founding in 2017. Credited with creating “larp theatre” we aim to produce opportunities for audiences to become activists, heroes, villains and storytellers in a theatrical experience built to adapt to them. </p>

<p>What if we don’t make our goal? Well, this is our first time crowdfunding and our first time with financial support. We’ve been operating solely off ticket sales and good choices since the beginning. We’ve put up 5 productions on our own without outside support. If we don’t make our goal we will be forced to price tickets in a way that will cover the gap, which we really don’t want to do. Even if we don’t reach our full goal every contribution helps. Every dollar we bring in from this campaign goes directly into the show. If you are able to make it to see the show you will be able to see the impact of your contribution. If you are unable to see the show you will still be able to follow along as we bring this show to life and see how your contribution helped create an experience so many people will enjoy. <br/><br/>If we have survived this long without crowdfunding why now? Because while we have met our goals on our previous shows it’s never exactly for profit. We price tickets as fairly as we can while paying everyone involved but there isn’t usually much left over. Ticket revenue from this show will be used to produce more shows and launch new talented writers and designers. At every step of the way you are funding jobs and sustainability in the creative economy. </p>

What will you do to stop an aggressive spirit? While exploring a real 19th century mansion you will be relied upon to collect stories, clues and ultimately decide the fate of one young woman who is either gifted or tormented by the spirits around her. Every night is unique because every audience is unique.
Love to investigate? Look into our perks to see how you can join us, get a private tour of the house, get a private show with a real life mentalist or go spirit hunting for real with a professional paranormal researcher.
Show Dates: Fridays and Saturdays at 8pm October 5th through November 2nd
Location: The Cotting Smith Assembly House, Salem MA
SALEM, OCTOBER 1849
Indulge yourself in the early Victorian period with a night of secrets, spirits, seances and scandals. While you roam this historic house, uniquely converted by Samuel McIntire, you will get to know the intimate secrets of some of Salem’s most interesting and famous residents, how will you use your information to help some and harm others? There are infinite paths in a house of Smoke and Mirrors

BUT WAIT, WHAT’S GAME THEATRE?
You may have heard of immersive theatre through shows like Sleep No More, And Then She Fell or experiences like Meow Wolf where the audience is inside the show, but what is Game Theatre you ask?
Game theatre is a step deeper into immersion. Intramersive developed game theatre back in 2017 when we took immersive theater and live action role playing and combined the two to create immersive, playable experiences where the audience has the same agency as the characters and the end of story is in your hands. You step into our world as a member of it, you do not need to invent a character, your personality is enough. Our characters bring you in as though you always belonged, entrust you with their secrets, and ask you for your unbiased opinions. When you participate in our world, your actions have consequences, your decisions mean something, the ending is up to you to make happen.
WHERE DOES ALL YOUR MONEY GO?
Meeting you halfway! We are already halfway funded thanks to the support of the Peabody Essex Museum. We have already covered artistic stipends, the cost of the venue and marketing. So what’s left you might ask? Well...
You get to come in at the fun part. If you love costumes, furniture, props, magic, tech crew, support staff, lighting, sound and special effects, then you are on the right team! 

The drawing room inside the Cotting Smith Assembly House, 2019
We are asking for $18,000 because, while we have the whole mansion to ourselves, it’s curated by a museum so we can’t really let you sit on the furniture, climb on the tables (as you do sometimes), go through the jewelry boxes (did no one teach you manners?!?). So it's been cleared out and we need you to help us fill it! We are going to get furniture you can lay down on, sit on, climb on, and riffle through. Not to mention some seriously creepy taxidermy (I mean it is the Victorian times) and some lifelike dead things under glass (fake dead things, well, fake mostly dead things...).
Additionally, and surprisingly to our returning Daemonologists, we also have access to electricity so we want to take full advantage of tricking out the lights, playing with sound and in general making the place feel as luscious and unsettling as possible. 
We are also excited to be able to work with local, talented artists who will help make some of these props and costumes. Funding this show helps fund the greater creative economy because we love to work with local shops, artists and vendors.  
Your funds will help make the world of Smoke and Mirrors one in which you can engage all five of your senses (or six, you do you).   
 
WHAT QUALIFIES YOU TO MAKE A WORLD?
Daemonologie: Smoke and Mirrors is the third installment of the Daemonologie Series produced by Intramersive Media, an immersive game theater company based in Salem MA. We create engaging shows that ask the audience to be involved and be as much as part of the story as they like. We have collaborated with numerous organizations as well as produced 5 original shows since our founding in 2017. Credited with creating “larp theatre” we aim to produce opportunities for audiences to become activists, heroes, villains and storytellers in a theatrical experience built to adapt to them. 
The team we have assembled to bring you this world is as impressive as they are creative. 
Carly Dwyer - Artistic Director, Co-Writer, Co-Director, is an award winning theatre director, larp writer and educator born and raised just north of Salem.

Diana Dunlap - Lead Writer and Content Developer, Co-Writer, Co-Director, is a playwright, historian, museum educator and veteran first person interpreter. Diana is also one of the founders of the Salem Historical Society where she is still a board member.

Caryn M. Boehm - Stage Manager, is a veteran theatre professional and Creative Engagement Producer at the Peabody Essex Museum.

Kristin is also a thanatologist, which isn’t the science of knowing everything about Thanos...well, actually, maybe it is.
Mike Schondeck - Creator of Digital Content - Mike Schondek is a video producer and experimental artist from Boston, MA. Mike also takes credit for the resurgence in the popularity of the song ""Africa"" by Toto. Jake Egan O'Hara and Breck Sullivan - Costume Designers - This award winning duo have been styling some of the regions most memorable productions such as Pippin with Actors Singers Project and My Fair Lady with Theatre III and Candide  with Opera Del West.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are two best friends who are passionate creating theatre together! Patrick Avery-Kenny is the writer and one-man-actor of this play, while Hailey is the director and technical designer. We have worked together as actor/director for 3 years, and Gamer Boy is our first self-written play AND Fringe show we have done. As two aspiring artists, this show has been a great contribution in both our theatre careers and by travelling with this show, we are hoping to gain more experience within this beautiful (and complicated) industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is ""Gamer Boy""?</h3>
<p>Gamer Boy is a true story told by Patrick himself about an unbelievably trip he went on when he was 13 years old. Without giving TOO much of the story away, 13 year old Patrick took his video game a little bit too far when we travelled across North America, by himself, to compete in a live gaming tournament. We had an incredibly successful 6-show run at the London Fringe Festival last summer (2018) and now we are so excited to be doing the show again THIS summer in Windsor and Calgary! Which brings us to our next point...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need your help!</h3>
<p>While we consider this show, the story and the experience of creating and performing this play priceless, traveling with a Fringe show does come at a cost. After looking at the expenses required to make this tour happen, we wanted to make an Indigogo so those who support us, our show, or theatre in general can help fund this venture. Here is what the donations will be helping to fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production Fees: theatre rental, tech rentals (ie. lighting equipment), billeting/lodging<ul>
<li>Windsor - $450</li>
<li>Calgary - $700</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Travel costs for Windsor - $150</li>
<li>2 plane tickets for Calgary (round trip) - $1000</li>
<li>Marketing materials - $100</li>
</ul>
<p>Any donation, no matter the amount, counts and is greatly appreciated! Check out our perks to see what items or shenanigans you can receive as appreciation for your support!</p>

<h3>Thank you so much.</h3>
<p>This show is honestly a dream for the both of us. We both feel so lucky to be sharing this play with more people this summer and are incredibly grateful for the support and love. We both thank you for reading and your potential donation! You're the best!</p>

</div><h1>Sinopsis</h1>
<p>“<i>Los impostores</i>” es la una historia sobre la pavorosa cotidianidad, aquella que hace que nos hace mentir y esconder los despojos de nuestro y otras vidas, según el frecuente y acostumbrado devenir de cada familia de bien.</p>
<p>Este ha sido históricamente un país de sepultureros, donde la mejor solución a las cosas es sentir el terraguero de silencio que cae sobre el ataúd de la verdad. Este país es una colectividad donde preferimos inhumar a exhumar, y donde anteponemos el encantamiento y el hechizo de los camposantos silenciosos y mágicos. Somos un país donde preferimos compartir nuestras vidas con los efluvios del alma, que con los destellos de la verdad…</p>
<p> “<i>Los impostores</i>” es un campo de batalla que desde la unidad de guerra más pequeña, la familia, nos deja al descubierto la carnaza de la que estamos hechos los hombres, a pesar de la querencia que decimos manifestar por el prójimo más cercano. </p>
<p>Los charlatanes y mentirosos tienen su cobertura más segura en el ámbito de la familia, como también sucede en las grandes corporaciones y lobbies que gobiernan este país.</p>
<p>Nuestros impostores son visitados por una particular de voz de la conciencia, en forma de “abuelo ausente”, que lo único que viene a hacer finalmente, es subrayar un texto que además habla del desasosiego…. “no hay solución”.</p>
<p>Y al final nos asaltan las dudas. ¿Después de tantas mentiras continuadas, seríamos capaces de distinguirla de la verdad en nuestra memoria? ¿Y si quisiéramos abrirnos en canal a la verdad, podríamos recuperar todo lo oscurecido por nuestros propios recuerdos?. </p>
<p>Hemos aceptado la amnesia como pacto, desde el cotidiano espectador, hasta la prensa de este país pasando por la justicia que nos protege. El oxímoron del “instante eterno”.</p>
<p>Para transportarlo todo a escena, proponemos el viejo sistema de colocarnos en el lugar del otro, en el lugar de lo “mas verdadero” y que no es otra posición que la del “abuelo ausente”… Justamente este es el personaje, que proponemos sacar del armario para observar el resto vida que se recluye en una gran vitrina a modo de armario o tumba, como expositor de nuestras propias vidas. Aunque a lo mejor, y de manera más precisa, quizás deberíamos decir que pretendemos arrastrar al público al interior del armario del “abuelo ausente”. </p>
<p>¿Y si nos situamos en otra cara del poliedro planteado por los autores?. ¿Y si este personaje, fueran el plano de lo real, y desde esa realidad fuéramos capaces de ver la partida de que los que están en otro plano están jugando? ¿Y si damos el valor preciso a las reflexiones de los autores asumiendo eso de que “<i>juego entre dos o más personas mediante el que se engañan a sí mismas,</i> <i>un juego que es el juego del autoengaño</i> <i>mutuo”</i>.?</p><p></p><h1>Destino de los fondos</h1><div>Los fondos serán destinados a <b>finalizar de la construcción de la escenografía</b>.</div><div>

Sala Cuarta Pared
25 años de experiencia nos han permitido convertirnos con el tiempo en una sala diez:



Somos un núcleo plural y dinamizador de las artes escénicas contemporáneas.


Mantenemos un claro apoyo a las nuevas dramaturgias en nuestra programación.


Somos punto de referencia para un público heterogéneo, nada elitista, que busca un teatro comprometido y de su época.


Albergamos festivales de danza y teatro, tanto propios como externos, que enriquecen la programación de cada temporada.


El espectador disfruta en nuestra sala del privilegio de la proximidad con el escenario y de la versatilidad del espacio.


Nuestra línea de programación busca montajes renovadores y arriesgados porque nos gusta ser un espacio abierto al cambio.


Además de la programación externa exhibimos la producción propia, con nuestra Compañía Cuarta Pared dirigida por Javier Yagüe y la compañía residente de danza, Provisional Danza, de Carmen Werner.


Promovemos otras actividades, como encuentros con compañías, charlas, descuentos… en respuesta a la inquietud de nuestros espectadores.


Ofrecemos ventajas extra a través del Club de Socios, porque si confías en Cuarta Pared, eres de Cuarta Pared.


La respuesta del público nos avala. Unos 35.000 espectadores siguen nuestra programación cada temporada.


Difusión escénica
Reymala y Teatro la República unifican esfuerzos de logística y distribución a través de Difusión Escénica, que será la herramienta de comunicación, negociación y contratación de espectáculos de ambas compañías, además de otras producciones nacionales e internacionales.


Con esta unión se busca generar sinergias en una industria, la cultural, que no está pasando por su mejor momento, y que necesita reinventarse para seguir viva.

Sinopsis
“Los impostores” es la una historia sobre la pavorosa cotidianidad, aquella que hace que nos hace mentir y esconder los despojos de nuestro y otras vidas, según el frecuente y acostumbrado devenir de cada familia de bien.
Este ha sido históricamente un país de sepultureros, donde la mejor solución a las cosas es sentir el terraguero de silencio que cae sobre el ataúd de la verdad. Este país es una colectividad donde preferimos inhumar a exhumar, y donde anteponemos el encantamiento y el hechizo de los camposantos silenciosos y mágicos. Somos un país donde preferimos compartir nuestras vidas con los efluvios del alma, que con los destellos de la verdad…
 “Los impostores” es un campo de batalla que desde la unidad de guerra más pequeña, la familia, nos deja al descubierto la carnaza de la que estamos hechos los hombres, a pesar de la querencia que decimos manifestar por el prójimo más cercano. 
Los charlatanes y mentirosos tienen su cobertura más segura en el ámbito de la familia, como también sucede en las grandes corporaciones y lobbies que gobiernan este país.
Nuestros impostores son visitados por una particular de voz de la conciencia, en forma de “abuelo ausente”, que lo único que viene a hacer finalmente, es subrayar un texto que además habla del desasosiego…. “no hay solución”.
Y al final nos asaltan las dudas. ¿Después de tantas mentiras continuadas, seríamos capaces de distinguirla de la verdad en nuestra memoria? ¿Y si quisiéramos abrirnos en canal a la verdad, podríamos recuperar todo lo oscurecido por nuestros propios recuerdos?. 
Hemos aceptado la amnesia como pacto, desde el cotidiano espectador, hasta la prensa de este país pasando por la justicia que nos protege. El oxímoron del “instante eterno”.
Para transportarlo todo a escena, proponemos el viejo sistema de colocarnos en el lugar del otro, en el lugar de lo “mas verdadero” y que no es otra posición que la del “abuelo ausente”… Justamente este es el personaje, que proponemos sacar del armario para observar el resto vida que se recluye en una gran vitrina a modo de armario o tumba, como expositor de nuestras propias vidas. Aunque a lo mejor, y de manera más precisa, quizás deberíamos decir que pretendemos arrastrar al público al interior del armario del “abuelo ausente”. 
¿Y si nos situamos en otra cara del poliedro planteado por los autores?. ¿Y si este personaje, fueran el plano de lo real, y desde esa realidad fuéramos capaces de ver la partida de que los que están en otro plano están jugando? ¿Y si damos el valor preciso a las reflexiones de los autores asumiendo eso de que “juego entre dos o más personas mediante el que se engañan a sí mismas, un juego que es el juego del autoengaño mutuo”.?Destino de los fondosLos fondos serán destinados a finalizar de la construcción de la escenografía.
Notas finales
Llevamos meses de trabajo intenso para tener a punto esta producción en Noviembre. Estamos deseando que participes para que vivas con nosotros la experiencia de ser mecenas, productor, amigo y confidente.
¡Conviértete en impostor!

<p>Hello, my name is Ryan Johnson, professional dancer and actor. I've had the pleasure of sharing my talents with the world by performing in various shows, including: The Beatles Love by Cirque du Soleil, the Off-Broadway hit STOMP in New York City and worldwide tours through partnerships with the US embassies. Now I have partnered with Quynn Johnson, an amazing dancer, author, and arts educator to give back to the world! </p>
<div>Together we have created SOLE Defined, a production celebrating the fusion of percussive dance, including: tap dance, stepping, body percussion and South African Gumboot dance all set to live music and digital arts. SOLE Defined has performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, the International Cajon Festival in Lima, Peru and colleges and universities across the United States. Now we are ready to take SOLE Defined to the next level! Creating a touring show with an arts and education component to help children learn math and science through movement and dance. We believe the performing arts saves lives through its ability to engage audiences through positive self expression. With your support, we will bring the arts to communities worldwide.<br/><br/>Our mission is to present SOLE Defined  in schools, universities, and festivals worldwide.

<p>From personal experience, we believe arts education can be mind changing in the lives of youth. As kids, arts education programs taught us to dream and imagine a world that could be shaped through movement.  It gave us an outlet and kept us away from some of the cruel realities of the world. We've learned how to creatively express ourselves, our ideas and to communicate emotions with others when our voice could not. This is why your donations are so important to us, not only are we looking to develop a touring show, we are also developing an arts and education program to take into school systems in each city we perform in. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> We strongly believe that with your support we can bring </span>positive<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> change and give kids a new ""</span>celebrity<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">"" to look up to. </span></p>

<h3>The Story So Far</h3>
<p>At the end of 2013, with the help of Arts Council England funding and our Co-Producer, <a href=""http://www.greenwichtheatre.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greenwich Theatre</a>, we began work on <i>Three Generations of Women</i>, carving out a new working practice by blending storytelling with a participatory development process, working in partnership with community groups, arts organisations and local authorities to begin conversations with women across the UK. The stories shared are platformed on a highly successful <a href=""http://www.threegenerationsofwomen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.threegenerationsofwomen.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interactive website</a> which continues to grow as a living archive, with around 2000 stories submitted to date, by women ranging in age, from 16 to 82.</p>
<p>The website (<a href=""http://www.threegenerationsofwomen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.threegenerationsofwomen.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.threegenerationsofwomen.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.threegenerationsofwomen.co.uk</a>) and forums have so far proved a safe space where confessional stories and personal experiences are shared openly. The company feels it has planted the first seeds of a virtual and actual community where women can share their stories, and we and our partners believe that the project has the potential to become a lasting record of the social experience of three generations of women, transforming personal oral history into inspiring theatrical record.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

YAAAAAAAAY! WE ACHIEVED OUR CROWDFUNDING TARGET!Thank you, thank you, thank you! We couldn't have done it without the 133 people who contributed and the countless others who supported us by sharing and promoting the project. What an extraordinary bunch you are. We won't let you down! 
Yesterday we were trending on the homepage of indiegogo, in the top-spot of theatre projects, and there we remain 'InDemand', which basically means people can keep donating to the cause forever - great for any latecomers, and a useful platform as we enter new, ambitious territories for the project. We are still accepting donations, and every penny will go towards a bigger and better future for Three Generations Of Women (more on this soon).What exciting times ahead - we do hope you'll stay on the journey with us - we will continue to give (far less frequent!) updates, if you're happy to receive them.  But for now we'll leave you with an inspiring montage of various #3gensofwomen supporters sharing their #mumsbestadvice gems, below. (Feel free to share your own on social media!)This entire project is all thanks to the people that have fed into it in various ways. THANK YOU for keeping it going. And if you've enjoyed learning about the project, please do continue to share it with friends.Love Broken Leg Theatre. x

A HUGE thank you to The Balcombe Charitable Trust for their incredibly generous grant of £1,000 towards our Three Generations of Women project. We are utterly over the moon and extremely cheered by the faith that they, and so many of you, have shown in us and our community-focused work.

So, that takes us up to almost £4,200 now and the target is in sight! We are determined to get as close to it as possible. This is our Eye of the Tiger moment! Please help us sprint down the final stretch by sharing the campaign far and wide...

WHAT'S THE BEST ADVICE YOUR MOTHER EVER GAVE YOU?

Three Generations of Women
 
A living archive documenting the experiences of women in the UK over the last 100 years, through online and face-to-face storytelling and sharing.
The overall ambition of this Broken Leg Theatre project is to complete the inspirational new play, Three Generations of Women, which aims to articulate stories from women, and then to tour it nationally.  This original play, written by Anna Jefferson and Alice Trueman, has contemporary relevance and proven wide appeal, being inspired by real-life stories researched with women who have grown up in the UK during the last 100 years.
Complementary to this, the company wants to work with hundreds more women to document their experiences, both online and face-to-face, encouraging them to find their own voice and tell their story.


   The Aim 
The money raised via this campaign will help us:• To grow and develop the online archive, described by the Independent on Sunday as a ‘new digital archive that is chronicling the lives of British women over the past hundred years’. To enable tens of thousands of stories to be shared; for women to be able to easily upload audio, so they can share and listen to recordings made on their phones.• To finish and tour the play which dramatises the differing experiences of grandmother, mother and daughter across three generations, and a family secret held as a direct response to societal expectations of women. We will work with experienced director, Kirsty Housley, to develop the production to tour it to: • To host forums up and down the country to continue these vital, exploratory conversations with women.• To run creative writing workshops, encouraging women to find their voice and tell their own story.The workshops and forums will take place in partnership with the theatres, connecting directly with audiences and engaging with the wider community.
The Story So Far
At the end of 2013, with the help of Arts Council England funding and our Co-Producer, Greenwich Theatre, we began work on Three Generations of Women, carving out a new working practice by blending storytelling with a participatory development process, working in partnership with community groups, arts organisations and local authorities to begin conversations with women across the UK.

The company feels it has planted the first seeds of a virtual and actual community where women can share their stories, and we and our partners believe that the project has the potential to become a lasting record of the social experience of three generations of women, transforming personal oral history into inspiring theatrical record.

Risks & Challenges  
This project invests substantially in a number of strategies for audience development as central to its overall ambitions. These initiatives are supported by strong relationships with our four primary touring venues, and build security into our ambition.
All of our strategies are designed to minimise risk.
We also included an industry standard contingency at 5% to support unexpected expenditure and matters arising along the way.

</h3><div>I'm Eleanor O'Brien, the artistic director of <a href=""http://dancenakedproductions.com/lust-marriage/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dance Naked Productions.</a>  I've spent the last 10 years making theater about intimacy, sexuality, relationships &amp; desire.  You may have seen my solo show <b><i>GGG: Dominatrix for Dummies</i></b>, or one of the ensemble productions of <i><b>Inviting Desire</b></i> (which I directed, performed and produced) or my newest solo show<i><b> Lust &amp; Marriage</b></i>.  <br/><br/>I'm cuckoo for coconuts about theater that that evolves human consciousness, especially as it pertains to sexuality.  My mission is to create shows that are provocative and thought-provoking and joyful.   I believe that humans learn through storytelling, and I want to tell stories that both illuminate and celebrate our erotic lives.  <br/><br/>I believe <b><i>Lust &amp; Marriage</i></b> is a catalyst for conversations about   love and desire.  About what happens when you open the relationship.  About whether or not it's possible to be monogamish.  The show shares an honest portrayal of the challenges and joys of living outside the box .  I think these are conversations that we should be having, especially as our cultural ideas about what marriage continue to grow and change, and one size no longer fits all (not that it ever did!).  <br/><br/>I now have an unprecedented opportunity to share this story with a wider audience.  <br/><br/> I won the <a href=""http://fringefestivals.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CAFF lottery</a>. 
 CAFF stands for Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals. (I have been 
applying to this lottery for the last 10 yeas).  Winning means that I get into ANY  fringe festival in Canada, which allows me to  build a

</div></div>","Lust & Marriage is going on tour!Hello lovelies! 
I'm Eleanor O'Brien, the artistic director of Dance Naked Productions.  I've spent the last 10 years making theater about intimacy, sexuality, relationships & desire.  You may have seen my solo show GGG: Dominatrix for Dummies, or one of the ensemble productions of Inviting Desire (which I directed, performed and produced) or my newest solo show Lust & Marriage.  I'm cuckoo for coconuts about theater that that evolves human consciousness, especially as it pertains to sexuality.  My mission is to create shows that are provocative and thought-provoking and joyful.   I believe that humans learn through storytelling, and I want to tell stories that both illuminate and celebrate our erotic lives.  I believe Lust & Marriage is a catalyst for conversations about   love and desire.  About what happens when you open the relationship.  About whether or not it's possible to be monogamish.  The show shares an honest portrayal of the challenges and joys of living outside the box .  I think these are conversations that we should be having, especially as our cultural ideas about what marriage continue to grow and change, and one size no longer fits all (not that it ever did!).  I now have an unprecedented opportunity to share this story with a wider audience.   I won the CAFF lottery. 
 CAFF stands for Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals. (I have been 
applying to this lottery for the last 10 yeas).  Winning means that I get into ANY  fringe festival in Canada, which allows me to  build a 
summer tour.  It means  I will be able to share this show with hundreds of people across the North American, starting in Montréal and going all the way to Vancouver, BC.  I will be on tour, living out of my van,  for FOUR months!  Winning the CAFF is a big deal.  
Unfortunately, winning the lottery in this case does not mean you get in
 free.  I still have to pay all the entrance fees (close to $5,000!).  (You see where this is going don't you?)  ; )But let me give you a little background.  In 2014 I went to Santa Fe to work with renown solo show coach Tanya Taylor Rubenstein.  I knew I wanted to create a show about polyamory (and I knew I couldn't do it alone!).  She helped me find the spine of the story.  While working on the script at Breitenbush, I met a wonderful musician (Jonah Mantranga) who created a score.  My dad drew the cartoons I used on my original set.  I workshopped  the show in Portland as part of the Fertile Ground Festival of New Work, where I learned a LOT.   
(this was the original postcard)People seems to really respond to the show.  I got some sweet reviews, and  I was invited to bring it to Seattle, where I did a two week run at the Theatre Off-Jackson. From Seattle I did a run in Santa Fe, and then the non-profit Sex-Positive World sponsored performances in Los Angeles, London and Brussels (where I learned that even if people don't know who Dan Savage is, the show still works!) (btw  - I wrote Dan Savage
 into the show because he has longed been my go-to for advice about

Vertigo gives undergraduate playwrights the opportunity to have their original scripts realized into full-fledged productions. By producing student-written theatre, Vertigo hopes to be a creative and dynamic presence on campus, encouraging students to take artistic risk. 
Vertigo is the only student theatre organization on campus that produces entirely student-written work. We strive for our shows to live beyond Northwestern. 
Vertigo was founded in 1994. That makes us 19 years old!   Why Boomer's Story

Boomer's Story, written by junior Max Abner, is an adventure from start to finish. In attempts to get his beautiful cowboy boots back to his Pa, Boomer finds himself in his greatest adventure yet. From guns, love, and outlaws, Boomer leaves the country to head to Citytown in order to get his stolen books back. 
Your donation to this show would go towards making student written theatre come to life, and opportunities to people in all areas of theatre to test their limits and discover new passions.    What is the money for?

All donations are for major design elements in order to make the show happen.

Sets: Sophomore, Kenzie Smith. In her first full set design on Northwestern's campus, Kenzie is working on making different background drops, paint, and antique pieces to make the Wild West come alive in the historical Shanley Pavilion.


Lights: Sophomore, Prateek Singh. In his first role as an autonomous lighting designer, Prateek is working towards highlighting each scene to help shift between locations, and blur the lines between fiction and reality. 


Sound: Sophomore, Juliet Roll. Juliet is taking an exciting approach to the sound design of the show and is working towards making any sounds made in the space during a show live. This means that she is working with the band and sound-specific objects to highlight the chaos in Boomer's world.


Props: Sophomore, Nick Tiffany. There is no way to create the Wild West without GUNS. Every prop in this play is chosen to represent the rugged landscape and live that the characters live. 


Costumes: Sophomore, Lindsay Ewell. Lindsay is working to create different outfits and looks to help distinguish between multiple characters played by a few actors. By choosing a base look, she is looking towards looks that can be detailed and redefined to show the shift of time and characters through the story.


Music: Sophomore, Nina Jayashankar. An exciting development in our production is the use of a live folk band. Nina is working with the musicians to transport the audience into the Wild West through classic folk tunes.

They played Laertes in this Nirvana/Hamlet mash-up, and wrote an original song for Laertes to sing over Opehlia's grave before the big ol' fight with Hamlet. </p><p>When they thought about what they wanted to do for their final project for their Shakespeare in Community class at CU Boulder, they decided it might be cool to write the rest of Laertes' album and imagine a world in which Ophelia goes on tour with Laertes and doesn't fricking die. As they began writing the show, they decided instead of playing Laertes, they wanted to play a dragged up Ophelia and make the character a queer performance artist and filmmaker.</p><p>To make sure everything sounded super awesome, they collaborated with powerhouse singer/songwriter Jules Murtha. </p><p>In this rock and roll re-telling of the <i>Hamlet</i> narrative, Ophelia is inspired by the aesthetic of Amy Winehouse.

They played Laertes in this Nirvana/Hamlet mash-up, and wrote an original song for Laertes to sing over Opehlia's grave before the big ol' fight with Hamlet. When they thought about what they wanted to do for their final project for their Shakespeare in Community class at CU Boulder, they decided it might be cool to write the rest of Laertes' album and imagine a world in which Ophelia goes on tour with Laertes and doesn't fricking die. As they began writing the show, they decided instead of playing Laertes, they wanted to play a dragged up Ophelia and make the character a queer performance artist and filmmaker.To make sure everything sounded super awesome, they collaborated with powerhouse singer/songwriter Jules Murtha. In this rock and roll re-telling of the Hamlet narrative, Ophelia is inspired by the aesthetic of Amy Winehouse.

<h3>SUPPORT WORSE THAN TIGERS' NYC PREMIERE</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>***Thanks to direct donations not reflected in this page's total we are currently at our goal! However, we still have a small deficit off $500 to cover. Can you help us?****</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE PLAY</strong></p>
<p>Olivia and Humphry have a safe, comfortable, enviable life. Their condo is well-adorned with fancy knick-knacks, their social media presence is meticulously groomed, and they never fight. Or laugh. Or kiss. Or talk very much.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly, Olivia’s lover-- id-driven Officer Kirk Patrick --shows up, trailing a man-eating tiger which takes up residence right outside, threatening to devour anyone who opens the door. Tigers may be dangerous, but there might be something worse inside.</p>
<p>The Mill makes its debut at the legendary New Ohio with the NYC premiere of Mark Chrisler's play. </p>
<p><strong>THE STORY </strong></p>
<p>Five years ago, at the urging of our mutual friends, I reached out to Mark Chrisler to find out more about his work. I've known Mark since our undergraduate days at NIU and as a peer in the Chicago theater community. I wasn't' familiar with his plays but had heard from many different folks that they were extraordinary. He sent me Worse Than Tigers and I was completely blown away. Doing a delicate dance between Realism and Absurdism the play was as hilarious as it was heartbreaking and I was determined to get it on stage.</p>
<p>Then my life took a strange turn. I was offered a job in TV/FILM production and I couldn't say no. The job offer was completely unexpected, and I felt it was an amazing opportunity if only I could stop weeping over the thought of leaving the theatre! Fast forward three years, an Emmy and a Peabody nomination later, I couldn't stop missing the theatre. The stars aligned and my dream of assisting Tony award-winning director, and my mentor, Anna Shapiro came true! Then, the kind and generous Robert Lyons, my boss at the New Ohio, offered me a slot there and again, more of my dreams were coming true. After a three year break, I would be back in the saddle, directing again. I couldn't be more thrilled to be producing and directing the NYC premiere of this play.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, I've assembled three of my all-time favorite actors (Shannon Marie Sullivan, Braeson Herold, and Zach Wegner) as well as a brilliant team of designers and technicians (Matt Carlin, Kate Ducey, Kristy Hall, Caspin Jones, Nat Di Marco, AJ Surasky).</p>
<p>...but making theatre in NYC (like doing anything in NYC) isn't cheap.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>I need your help to raise $6500 to make the show possible</h3>
<p>The overall budget for this show is $11,500. </p>
<p>The Mill has $2000 in the bank and we expect $2500 in ticket revenue. Leaving a $6500 gap.</p>
<p>Most of the shows budget, $7000, goes towards paying the folks who are making it happen, the actors, designers, and technicians -- who all deserve much more than the modest stipends we can afford but are so committed to the project, they are willing to donate much of their time and energy.</p>
<p>The other $3500 covers the cost of the set, props, and costumes.</p>
<p>Leaving just a $500 deficit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of your contribution</h3>
<p>I truly can't make this play happen without your help. The only way that new plays exist is through the support and contributions of private donors and foundations. Without a significant producing history in NY state, receiving grant money for The Mill is almost impossible. </p>

<p>What if you could escape the chaos of a busy, scheduled life to the quiet of Nothing?</p>
<p>After his teacher mentions the universe is growing, the constantly busy Simon Ives becomes obsessed with the idea of discovering this Edge - the place between nothing and everything, where he can just be. Simon dreams of going to a place where no one needs him to do anything.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the Edge of Everything is a boy who longs for someone to need him to do something. He seems to have done everything, and even redoes everything, but longs for company.</p>
<p>When Simon is rocketed into space (through an unlikely series of events involving “lots and lots of fireworks”), their worlds collide and neither will ever be the same.</p>

Established in 2005, Purple Crayon Players is an award-winning student theatre company at Northwestern University committed to producing theatre for young audiences. PCP seeks to create thought-provoking smart and entertaining theatre for young audiences, which we believe is theatre for all audiences!
   the show 
What if you could escape the chaos of a busy, scheduled life to the quiet of Nothing?
After his teacher mentions the universe is growing, the constantly busy Simon Ives becomes obsessed with the idea of discovering this Edge - the place between nothing and everything, where he can just be. Simon dreams of going to a place where no one needs him to do anything.
Meanwhile, at the Edge of Everything is a boy who longs for someone to need him to do something. He seems to have done everything, and even redoes everything, but longs for company.
When Simon is rocketed into space (through an unlikely series of events involving “lots and lots of fireworks”), their worlds collide and neither will ever be the same.
  the donation 
Your donation would be instrumental in helping us make this show happen, and we couldn't achieve this without your help. Although we are affiliated with Northwestern University and Purple Crayon Players, this production is entirely student run, which means that we are responsible for raising the funds to build our set, rent our lights, buy costumes and props, and more.
Here are some of the ways your donation would help us: 
Buying lumber, furniture, paint, and more to build the set that will serve as the world of the play
Making and buying period-specific costumes for our cast to wear
Obtaining props from thrift stores, rental markets, supermarkets, or wherever else
Renting lighting and sound equipment as well as projection equipment
Helping us advertise the show so our message can reach as many people as possible
…and more!

<p><strong>So why are we here on Indiegogo? </strong>Well friends, we have some EXCITING NEWS! For the second time in less than 5 years, Renaissance Theaterworks will participate in the Samuel French Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival (OOB) in New York City. </p>
<p>Our <strong>2018 Br!NK New Play Festival</strong> included a production of the haunting and heartbreaking short play <strong>ALL OF THE EVERYTHING</strong>. Written by Minnesota native, <strong>Alayna Jacqueline</strong>, ALL OF THE EVERYTHING begins with a young African American couple out for a drive, where the woman begins to manipulate time in order to experience their entire future before they reach the destination that changes their lives forever.</p>

<p>(Photo from the 2018 Br!NK New Play Festival performance of ALL OF THE EVERYTHING)</p>
<p>After its successful premiere at Br!NK, RTW encouraged Alayna to submit ALL OF THE EVERYTHING to the OOB Festival. From over 900 initial submissions, Alayna has earned a place as a semi-finalist in the top 30. As a direct result of her experience with Br!NK, Alayna has asked RTW to produce and direct her short play this coming August in NYC. We are honored she has asked us to participate and thrilled to accept this amazing opportunity!</p>
<p><strong>ALL OF THE EVERYTHING will perform on Friday, August 23rd, 2019</strong> at 7:00 PM at the Vineyard Dimson 15th Street Theatre, NYC. Following the performances of the top 30 semi-finalists, 12 finalists will be selected to perform again on Saturday, August 24th, 2019. Of those 12, the six festival winners will be announced on Saturday evening. These winners will have their short play published in the Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival series, which is licensed and published by Samuel French, Inc. This will be RTW’s second trip to OOB. In 2015, RTW produced <strong>LUCKY NUMBERS</strong> by<strong> Gwendolyn Rice</strong> and made it to the final 12.<i>This time we aim to win!</i></p>
<h3>The National Stage</h3>
<p>For Playwright, Alayna Jacqueline, this opportunity is life changing! The Samuel French Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival offers a prize of publication and licensing for six short plays in the notable OFF OFF BROADWAY FESTIVAL PLAYS series. This year, from over 900 initial submissions, 30 semifinalist plays were chosen and will be performed over a week at the Vineyard’s Dimson Theatre. At the end of the OOB Festival, the six finalists will be named.</p>

<p>(Playwright Alayna Jacqueline)</p>
<p>For Renaissance, producing at the OOB Festival is the opportunity of a lifetime.

For those of you who don't know us and for those of you who do and need a little reminder, we are Renaissance Theaterworks, Milwaukee's ONLY professional, nonprofit theater company dedicated to PROMOTING THE WORK OF WOMEN onstage and off. We are also the nation's second oldest theater company with the unique mission to promote gender parity.
OUR MISSION: Dedicated to promoting the work of women onstage and off, Renaissance Theaterworks creates moving theater that connects with our shares sense of being human.


 

So why are we here on Indiegogo? Well friends, we have some EXCITING NEWS! For the second time in less than 5 years, Renaissance Theaterworks will participate in the Samuel French Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival (OOB) in New York City. 
Our 2018 Br!NK New Play Festival included a production of the haunting and heartbreaking short play ALL OF THE EVERYTHING. Written by Minnesota native, Alayna Jacqueline, ALL OF THE EVERYTHING begins with a young African American couple out for a drive, where the woman begins to manipulate time in order to experience their entire future before they reach the destination that changes their lives forever.

(Photo from the 2018 Br!NK New Play Festival performance of ALL OF THE EVERYTHING)
After its successful premiere at Br!NK, RTW encouraged Alayna to submit ALL OF THE EVERYTHING to the OOB Festival. From over 900 initial submissions, Alayna has earned a place as a semi-finalist in the top 30. As a direct result of her experience with Br!NK, Alayna has asked RTW to produce and direct her short play this coming August in NYC. We are honored she has asked us to participate and thrilled to accept this amazing opportunity!
ALL OF THE EVERYTHING will perform on Friday, August 23rd, 2019 at 7:00 PM at the Vineyard Dimson 15th Street Theatre, NYC. Following the performances of the top 30 semi-finalists, 12 finalists will be selected to perform again on Saturday, August 24th, 2019. Of those 12, the six festival winners will be announced on Saturday evening. These winners will have their short play published in the Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival series, which is licensed and published by Samuel French, Inc. This will be RTW’s second trip to OOB. In 2015, RTW produced LUCKY NUMBERS by Gwendolyn Rice and made it to the final 12.This time we aim to win!
The National Stage
For Playwright, Alayna Jacqueline, this opportunity is life changing! The Samuel French Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival offers a prize of publication and licensing for six short plays in the notable OFF OFF BROADWAY FESTIVAL PLAYS series. This year, from over 900 initial submissions, 30 semifinalist plays were chosen and will be performed over a week at the Vineyard’s Dimson Theatre. At the end of the OOB Festival, the six finalists will be named.

<p>We are creating a<strong> mixed-media performance art and theatre piece</strong> that will explore the intersections between race, class, gender and sexuality as we have experience it as mixed mamas.We need $5000 to make Mixed Mama's remixed volume 1 a reality.</p>
<p>Your contribution goes to directly to paying for the venue, director, musicians, tech, designer, printing, recording the show, studio time, production and postage. We're both over committed and tired of putting our art to the side. This is our chance to merge, create and grow, but we need your help. After years of being poor starving artist/activists we are asking our community of friends family and colleagues to help support our dreams.</p>
<p>Our campaign perks range from a facebook shout out to customized postcards, CDs, chapbooks, tickets to our show to voice recorded messages and official thank yous on our program. Every little bit helps!</p>
<p>We hope that the final live performance will reach 200 people over the cource of the weekend. Through the release of both a CD and chapbook we will reach additional 300 people. Large scale at least 500 people will be exposed to our work in through some medium and hopefully we inspired to tell their own stories and create their own artwork. We see this work as cyclical, renewing and as a form of resistance. Art is healing, healing is resistance.</p>
<p>This project is about liveness and humanity. It's about being open with stories that we've held on to for too long and sharing them with our community with laughter and sadness, beauty and pain. We are opening ourselves up and sharing our stories with the accompaniment of a live band. This piece is not only about creating a dynamic show that can push us as artists it's also to create a collective healing space.</p>
<p>We also understand that not everyone can help us through financial contributions. We do need help SPREADING THE WORD around--putting up flyers and postcards in cafes, schools, community centers, music and poetry venues around Chicago, videorecording our show, writing reviews, publicizing online, doing text message campaigns, donating food for our musicians, volunteering at the show to handle the door, stage managing, donating studio and rehearsal space for recording the CD and practicing our show. Please hit us up if you can volunteer your time.</p>
<p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<p>Stacy and Sage met in Chicago. One sings, one writes poetry together they flow like chocolate covered fried matzoh.</p>
<p><strong>Sage Xaxua Morgan-Hubbard</strong> is a multidisciplinary artist, poet, activist, and educator. She is currently the Academic Partnership Coordinator of the Dance department at Columbia College Chicago. She was the Cipher Organizer for Words, Beats &amp; Life's inaugural Midwest Hip Hop Teach-In ""Remixing the Art of Social Change"" at Columbia in 2011. Most recently she served as the Outreach Director of Young Chicago Authors and as a teaching artist throughout the Chicagoland area instructing kindergarten through college-level students in jail and beyond. She earned her MA in Performance Studies at Northwestern University and is a graduate of Brown University where she studied ""Performance Studies: Socially Conscious Art of the Everyday"" and Ethnic Studies. She is a member of Real Talk Live Chicago poetry collective, the founder of WORD! spoken word artists and activists in Providence, RI, a former Washington, D.C youth poetry slam coach, and one of the original members of Spoken Resistance, DC Writers Corps and the performance group Sol y Soul. She was born a child radical fist first. She found poetry at the tender age of 14 and has been in love ever since. She performed her way through sanity. Sage has always spoken her truth, opened her heart and brain to knowlege, made mistakes: smiled, laughed, resisted &amp; renewed. She is a Larry Neal award winner, a Gwendolyn Brooks Open Mic award winner, a Hurston-Wright writer, a Poets&amp; Writers educator, DC young Artist award grantee, hip-hop theater head, funktafied grown up kid who used spoken word &amp; music as medicine for survival.

Sage is delighted to take her one-woman show Mixed Mamas (originally written &amp; performed in May 2012 in celebration of her various mamas) to the next level in this incredible Remix with Stacy!</p>
<p><strong>Stacy Rene Erenberg</strong> is a community organizer, activist healer and socially conscious songstress hailing from the north side of Chicago. She is emerging as a noted young vocalist who’s sound is sultry, with a tint of honey and much soul. Since her Chicago Debut in 2006, she has performed at legendary Chicago venues such as The Jazz Showcase, The Metro and The Park West. She is the front woman for prolific local groups  Vertikal, The Damaste Jazz Project, and My damn Butterfly. Her style and delivery is as diverse as her cultural background. She is influenced by jazz, soul, r and b, pop, hip-hop and most importantly folk music, which fuels her passion for telling the peoples history through her music. Stacy can’t remember a time when she wasn’t singing. She grew up in a musical family that was involved with a Buddhist organization that was constantly putting on musical productions. At the age of four she was singing in front of large crowds and composing melodies. Since childhood she has continued to grow and thrive as a vocalist. In 2008, Chicago-Sun Times music critic Jim Derogotis stated that Vertikal, which Stacy is lead vocalist for, is, ” Dedicated to bridging the gap between hip-hop and jazz but also incorporating elements of funk, neo-soul, Latin, rock and blues, the mixed-gender, multi-ethnic band nonetheless churns out some surprisingly seamless and very accomplished grooves.” She is also the 2011 recipient of the Illinois Arts Council Professional Development Grant. She also enjoys hanging with friends and family, decompressing with her partner by watching bad T.V, laughing out loud and dancing it out on a regular basis.</p></div>","*Update: the performance will now be Friday May 31st- Sunday June 2nd!

We're both over committed and tired of putting our art to the side. This is our chance to merge, create and grow, but we need your help. After years of being poor starving artist/activists we are asking our community of friends family and colleagues to help support our dreams.
Our campaign perks range from a facebook shout out to customized postcards, CDs, chapbooks, tickets to our show to voice recorded messages and official thank yous on our program. Every little bit helps!
We hope that the final live performance will reach 200 people over the cource of the weekend. Through the release of both a CD and chapbook we will reach additional 300 people. Large scale at least 500 people will be exposed to our work in through some medium and hopefully we inspired to tell their own stories and create their own artwork. We see this work as cyclical, renewing and as a form of resistance. Art is healing, healing is resistance.
This project is about liveness and humanity. It's about being open with stories that we've held on to for too long and sharing them with our community with laughter and sadness, beauty and pain. We are opening ourselves up and sharing our stories with the accompaniment of a live band. This piece is not only about creating a dynamic show that can push us as artists it's also to create a collective healing space.
We also understand that not everyone can help us through financial contributions. We do need help SPREADING THE WORD around--putting up flyers and postcards in cafes, schools, community centers, music and poetry venues around Chicago, videorecording our show, writing reviews, publicizing online, doing text message campaigns, donating food for our musicians, volunteering at the show to handle the door, stage managing, donating studio and rehearsal space for recording the CD and practicing our show. Please hit us up if you can volunteer your time.
Who we are:
Stacy and Sage met in Chicago. One sings, one writes poetry together they flow like chocolate covered fried matzoh.
Sage Xaxua Morgan-Hubbard is a multidisciplinary artist, poet, activist, and educator. She is currently the Academic Partnership Coordinator of the Dance department at Columbia College Chicago. She was the Cipher Organizer for Words, Beats & Life's inaugural Midwest Hip Hop Teach-In ""Remixing the Art of Social Change"" at Columbia in 2011. Most recently she served as the Outreach Director of Young Chicago Authors and as a teaching artist throughout the Chicagoland area instructing kindergarten through college-level students in jail and beyond. She earned her MA in Performance Studies at Northwestern University and is a graduate of Brown University where she studied ""Performance Studies: Socially Conscious Art of the Everyday"" and Ethnic Studies. She is a member of Real Talk Live Chicago poetry collective, the founder of WORD! spoken word artists and activists in Providence, RI, a former Washington, D.C youth poetry slam coach, and one of the original members of Spoken Resistance, DC Writers Corps and the performance group Sol y Soul. She was born a child radical fist first. She found poetry at the tender age of 14 and has been in love ever since. She performed her way through sanity. Sage has always spoken her truth, opened her heart and brain to knowlege, made mistakes: smiled, laughed, resisted & renewed. She is a Larry Neal award winner, a Gwendolyn Brooks Open Mic award winner, a Hurston-Wright writer, a Poets& Writers educator, DC young Artist award grantee, hip-hop theater head, funktafied grown up kid who used spoken word & music as medicine for survival. Sage believes in praxis, peace, & the arts as tools for social change and transformation. Sage is delighted to take her one-woman show Mixed Mamas (originally written & performed in May 2012 in celebration of her various mamas) to the next level in this incredible Remix with Stacy!
Stacy Rene Erenberg is a community organizer, activist healer and socially conscious songstress hailing from the north side of Chicago. She is emerging as a noted young vocalist who’s sound is sultry, with a tint of honey and much soul. Since her Chicago Debut in 2006, she has performed at legendary Chicago venues such as The Jazz Showcase, The Metro and The Park West. She is the front woman for prolific local groups  Vertikal, The Damaste Jazz Project, and My damn Butterfly. Her style and delivery is as diverse as her cultural background. She is influenced by jazz, soul, r and b, pop, hip-hop and most importantly folk music, which fuels her passion for telling the peoples history through her music. Stacy can’t remember a time when she wasn’t singing. She grew up in a musical family that was involved with a Buddhist organization that was constantly putting on musical productions. At the age of four she was singing in front of large crowds and composing melodies. Since childhood she has continued to grow and thrive as a vocalist. In 2008, Chicago-Sun Times music critic Jim Derogotis stated that Vertikal, which Stacy is lead vocalist for, is, ” Dedicated to bridging the gap between hip-hop and jazz but also incorporating elements of funk, neo-soul, Latin, rock and blues, the mixed-gender, multi-ethnic band nonetheless churns out some surprisingly seamless and very accomplished grooves.” She is also the 2011 recipient of the Illinois Arts Council Professional Development Grant. She also enjoys hanging with friends and family, decompressing with her partner by watching bad T.V, laughing out loud and dancing it out on a regular basis.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

What We Need & What You Get

We have already raised $10,000, and as in politics, early money is critical.  We now need to raise an additional $30,000 toward our final goal of $40,000.

These funds are needed to cover production costs including:


Theatre Rental
Artist and crew fees
A publicist and publicity
Marketing
Sets/Costumes/Lighting
Insurance
And much more...

We are offering a wide array of perks including:


Tickets to the show
Invitations to an exclusive opening night reception
Invitations to a working rehearsal
Posters autographed by the cast, director and playwright
Producer credits

Additionally, your donations are tax deductible to the extent permitted by law!  

But here's the bottom line:  This project is exceptional, and one you will be proud to be part of.  We have a proven track record of success, and there is no doubt that with the same team back in place, and an original play developed specifically for us by a Drama Desk nominated playwright, that we will once again put our money where our mouth is and make every single one of you proud.  



Our Story

Last fall was amazing:  Knife Edge Productions produced an award-winning play on a New York stage.   We performed to a packed house night after night and audience members included actors Cynthia Nixon and Bobby Cannavale as well as Tony nominated playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis.  

This could not have been possible without the enormous support of the over 150 backers who believed in us and donated close to $40,000.  And we are very proud to say that we did in fact put our money where our mouth is:  Our production of Tape was extremely successful and played to wide acclaim. In fact, Sandra Mardenfeld of “Show Showdown” just named Tape favorite play of 2011!


“Stephen Belber’s Tape moved me like no other show in 2011. This Off-Broadway production showed the after effect of high school through sharp observation and gun-fire paced dialogue.” -- Sandra Mardenfeld of “Show Showdown”


Of all the reviews we got, the comments we heard most often -- and took the most seriously -- were about the strength of our onstage dynamic. Based on that, we've taken the step of commissioning a play written specifically to our strengths and chemistry as actors.  We believe that an original work by an established playwright will attract significant attention, and also opens the door to the possibility that another theatre company could license our production. And yes, there is even the chance (however slim) that we could option film rights.

We are very excited to tell you that we have found our man: Drama Desk-nominated playwright Julian Sheppard. Julian's plays include Buicks, which was originally produced by the Underwood Theater in New York. The production received 2 Drama Desk nominations, including one for Outstanding Play.  Buicks has subsequently been produced regionally in the U.S., was developed for TV by Joe Roth, Paramount and CBS.  Buicks is currently being developed for film with producer Fred Roos and director Jessica Landaw. You can read Julian’s complete bio by clicking here.   

But wait, it get’s better and better: We have had discussions with Obie Award and Drama Desk Award-winning actor Reed Birney to join us in this production.  In the last year alone, Reed received a Special Drama Desk Award honoring his thirty six years of work as an actor, Actor’s Equity awarded him the Richard Seff Award and Charles Isherwood of the New York Times christened him the “hardest-working actor”.   Julian is writing a role with Reed specifically in mind.

All this, combined with the fact that Sam Helfrich is back at the helm as director, gives us great confidence that we will repeat and even go beyond the enormous success we had with Tape.

Julian began work on this brand-new play in January, inspired by our work as actors and with us specifically in mind.  The play centers on a young man who has moved to New York City for a mysterious new job.  He strikes up a friendship with his building’s super, whom he encounters in his apartment when he first arrives.

<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>cold.dead.fish is an independent theatre company that focuses on new works and emerging artists. We're interested in creating visually stimulating, emotionally challenging, intellectually engaging theatre. <em>Pushed</em> and <em>Release, </em>two new plays by Jessica Peverett, will be presented at the 2012 Edmonton Fringe Festival. We're so excited to share these projects with you. </p>
<p><strong>Here's a little bit about the shows!<br/><br/><em>Pushed (featuring Mary Hulbert &amp; Jessica Peverett):</em></strong><em> </em>After meeting in Lamaze class, two women bond over the highs and lows of being pregnant. What follows is a contemplation of possession and what it means to be a mother. 5 Stars - Vue Weekly, 2011 ""Pushed is a dark gem""</p>
<p><em><strong>Release (featuring Mari Chartier &amp; Cody Porter): </strong></em>Tabitha didn't go to work today. Instead she did something (really) bad. There are old people wandering the parking lot, a father who doesn't want to understand and a lot of boxes that remind her of what she's lost. How can you let go when you can't move on?<em><br/></em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why is the Edmonton Fringe Festival so amazing?</h3>
<div>The Edmonton Fringe is the second largest Fringe festival in the world where 41 venues house over 1500 performances. Last year over 192,000 tickets were sold and they estimate that nearly half a million people came out to visit the Fringe site. This is the perfect place for artists to present their work to a diverse audience. It's a chance to take risks and to rely on themselves to produce shows. <br/><br/>The Edmonton Fringe is also unique because it runs on a lottery system and allows companies to book their own venues (BYOV - bring your own venue). We were lucky enough to snag a spot in one of those 41 lottery venues AND find our own venue. With two shows on the go, we've been very busy! <br/><br/><h3>How can you help cold.dead.fish?</h3>
<p>The Edmonton Fringe is a fabulous tool for independent artists to get out and produce new works. Of course, with great opportunities come some financial snags. We're responsible for paying all the bills. This includes application fees, venue rental fees, insurance fees and that's just to house us! From there, we have to pay for our set, our costumes, our props, our rehearsal space and the rest of our marketing materials (posters, handbills, etc). All this has to be paid off before we can even think about paying our actors a fair wage. </p>
<p>It's really important to us that we be able to compensate the people who throw themselves into these projects and there are no guarantees at Fringe!</p>
<p>So here's what we're trying to subsidize before we get to the festival:</p>
<p>1. The $635.00 application fee for our lottery venue<br/>2. $215.00 to pay our technician in the BYOV<br/><br/><br/></p>

cold.dead.fish is an independent theatre company that focuses on new works and emerging artists. We're interested in creating visually stimulating, emotionally challenging, intellectually engaging theatre. Pushed and Release, two new plays by Jessica Peverett, will be presented at the 2012 Edmonton Fringe Festival. We're so excited to share these projects with you. 
Here's a little bit about the shows!Pushed (featuring Mary Hulbert & Jessica Peverett): After meeting in Lamaze class, two women bond over the highs and lows of being pregnant. What follows is a contemplation of possession and what it means to be a mother. 5 Stars - Vue Weekly, 2011 ""Pushed is a dark gem""
Release (featuring Mari Chartier & Cody Porter): Tabitha didn't go to work today. Instead she did something (really) bad. There are old people wandering the parking lot, a father who doesn't want to understand and a lot of boxes that remind her of what she's lost. How can you let go when you can't move on?


Why is the Edmonton Fringe Festival so amazing?
The Edmonton Fringe is the second largest Fringe festival in the world where 41 venues house over 1500 performances. Last year over 192,000 tickets were sold and they estimate that nearly half a million people came out to visit the Fringe site. This is the perfect place for artists to present their work to a diverse audience. It's a chance to take risks and to rely on themselves to produce shows. The Edmonton Fringe is also unique because it runs on a lottery system and allows companies to book their own venues (BYOV - bring your own venue). We were lucky enough to snag a spot in one of those 41 lottery venues AND find our own venue. With two shows on the go, we've been very busy! How can you help cold.dead.fish?
The Edmonton Fringe is a fabulous tool for independent artists to get out and produce new works. Of course, with great opportunities come some financial snags. We're responsible for paying all the bills. This includes application fees, venue rental fees, insurance fees and that's just to house us! From there, we have to pay for our set, our costumes, our props, our rehearsal space and the rest of our marketing materials (posters, handbills, etc). All this has to be paid off before we can even think about paying our actors a fair wage. 
It's really important to us that we be able to compensate the people who throw themselves into these projects and there are no guarantees at Fringe!
So here's what we're trying to subsidize before we get to the festival:
1. The $635.00 application fee for our lottery venue2. $215.00 to pay our technician in the BYOV

<p><strong><em>“For years after leaving home I carried an old family picture; tucked it directly behind my driver’s license. Where the latter went the former followed—sometimes whispering, sometimes shouting: “I am not the Black Man you think I am.”</em></strong></p>
<h3>The Project:</h3>
<p>BrownBox African American Theatre is thrilled to present the April 2013 World Premiere of Chad Goller-Sojourner’s sophomore solo performance: <em>Riding in Cars with Black People &amp; Other Newly Dangerous Acts: A Memoir in Vanishing Whiteness</em>. ---<em>Riding in Cars with Black People</em> is the groundbreaking and crushingly honest story of what happens when a black boy, raised by white parents, “ages out” of honorary white and suburban privilege and into a world where folklore, statistics, and conjecture deem him dangerous until proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Of course this show is about a lot more than what happens when white parents ship their black kids off to college in ill-fitted automobiles. At times funny, biting, and somber, <em>Riding in Cars with Black People</em> unpacks race, privilege, and identity like only a transracial adoptee can.</p>
<h3><strong>Why This Project Matters:  </strong></h3>
<p>Google “conversation on race” and you’ll get about 201,000,000 results—seems everyone has an opinion. But for a “conversation on race” to be fruitful it must be made up of more than opinions. It must be made up of critical and unique voices. <em>Riding in Cars with Black People</em> is one of those voices; ultimately demonstrating how even the most painful of experiences can be reclaimed, transformed, and accepted for what they are: the building blocks of our unique identities.</p>
<p><strong><em>“While I did not know it at the time, one of the benefits of my honorary white and suburban privilege was the ability to gather, congregate, and move aimlessly through public spaces without attention or purpose.”</em></strong></p>
<h3> <strong>How We’ll Use Your Contributions: </strong>
</h3>
<p>Contrary to its name, there’s nothing solo (or cheap) about mounting a solo performance, especially a multimedia solo performance.Your contributions of $9,800 will be used to cover Artistic &amp; Creative Fees including: Dramaturge, Director, Performer, and Choreographer, as well as Multimedia, Sound, Lighting, and Set Designers. Then there’s the production side, which includes Venue &amp; Rehearsal Space Rental, Insurance, Tech Crew, House Manager, Marketing/PR, Videographer, and Equipment Rental.Told you there was a lot.</p>
<p>Now the good news: we’ve done this before and are pretty good about spending money wisely and getting the best return for our buck. In fact our first solo performance, <em>Sitting in Circles with Rich White Girls: Memoirs of a Bulimic Black Boy </em>which premiered in July 2008, went on to a successful three year college tour and a 2010 revival. See <a href=""http://www.sitting-in-circles.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sitting-in-circles.com</a>. Speaking of tours and revivals, any monies raised beyond $9,800 will go towards mounting the <em>Riding in Cars with Black People &amp; Other Newly Dangerous Acts</em> World Domination Tour!</p>
<h3><strong>How You Can Contribute:</strong></h3>
<p>1) By making a financial contribution via PayPal* or Credit Card. Any amount helps. In fact, if 300 people donate $33 dollars, we will meet our fundraising goal.</p>
<p>2) Spread the word: tell your friends, family, coworkers, listserv, everybody. It’s as easy as posting the Indiegogo Campaign link on your Facebook, Twitter, Blog, or wherever you think interested people will see it. Finally, “Like” and promote our <em>Riding in Cars with Black People &amp; Other Newly Dangerous Acts</em> Facebook page.</p>

We introduce a new concept in sports Called ""Precision Point combat"". Although WFL has had our official first show at Ultracon Of South Florida we plan on traveling the nation and entertaining many. But before that can happen...promotion is essential. </p> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>WFL has been in the works of locking WCW Tag Team Champion Brian Knobbs of ""the Nasty Boys"" as our spokesman. Having the likes of Mr. Knobbs spreading the word about our league would catapult us into endless opportunities.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi, I'm Samantha Hull and I run WFL (World Foam League). We introduce a new concept in sports Called ""Precision Point combat"". Although WFL has had our official first show at Ultracon Of South Florida we plan on traveling the nation and entertaining many. But before that can happen...promotion is essential.     What We Need & What You Get WFL has been in the works of locking WCW Tag Team Champion Brian Knobbs of ""the Nasty Boys"" as our spokesman. Having the likes of Mr. Knobbs spreading the word about our league would catapult us into endless opportunities. In the coming months we will be launching a micro funding campaign to get all our ducks in a row but first we need to give Mr. Knobbs a down payment to get the ball rolling.   $2,500 is needed to get Brian Knobbs signature on a year long promotional contract.  $500 is needed to travel to Mr. Knobbs with all the fighters to start immediate filming of promotional videos.

<p><strong>Dearest Friends and Supporters,<br/></strong><span>Hello! I'm Benjamin Landsberg, a Toronto based contemporary dancer and independant choreographer. Last year I was the lucky recipient of the DanceOntario Creative Partnership Commission for 2012, which I used to create my first full-length work, <em>Chemical Messengers</em>. During that creation process in Montreal, it was my honor to have the wonderful Ms. Dena Davida of <a href=""http://www.tangente.qc.ca/index.php?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tangente</a> notice my work and appreciate it as a part of what she calls ""a resurgence of movement invention"". <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Ms. Davida has since been offered a carte blanche evening at <a href=""http://www.transatlantiquemontreal.com/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Festival Transatlantique Montreal</a>, in which she has decided to bring together three fresh male choreographic voices that she believes are a part of this movement. In this specially curated evening, I will be presented alongside two other extremely talented young male choreographers from <a href=""http://www.grandsballets.com/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Les Grands Ballets Canadiens</a>. I have recognized this opportunity as a deep honor and an exciting opportunity for my work and for my dancers, but I need your help.<br/></span></p>
<p><strong>Where You Come In<br/></strong>The money for this festival is scarce, and my participation in it is not supported financially by grants or organizations. I am working through fundraising (this campaign included) and networking to raise enough money to pay my dancers modestly, and to cover the costs of production and travel to Montreal. We will create the work in an intensive 2.5 week process leading right up to the show, in September. Any donation in any amount is a huge help to me and my dancers, and is so appreciated. I believe that this festival is an invaluable step in my very new choreographic career. </p>

<p>Originally one of only two annual Creative Partnership commissions from DanceOntario, <em>Chemical Messengers</em> chronicles and abstracts the loss of mankind’s biochemical link to the unseen mind of the planet, and the resulting descent into a patriarchal, dominator style society. <em>The Bystander Ritual</em> is a sister piece, adapted choreographically into a trio specially for Festival Transatlantique Montreal. By re-examining in detail certain relationships from <em>Chemical Messengers</em>, <em>The Bystander Ritual</em> explores power dynamics between victims, aggressors, and most importantly, bystanders.

<p>Benjamin Landsberg is a Toronto-born contemporary dancer and independent choreographer.  Since his completion of Ryerson University’s Performance Dance BFA Program, he has performed and collaborated with Typecast Dance Company, MOVE: the company, inDance, Kaeja d’Dance, Ezdanza, Compagnie Flak, and Pro Arte Danza, and toured through Canada, Asia, and the United States. He has danced works by Darryl Tracy, D. A. Hoskins, Robert Glumbek, Roberto Campagnella, Emily Molnar, Joshua Beamish, Hari Krishnan, Edgar Zendejas, Laurence Lemieux, and Jose Navas.

<p> Benjamin Landsberg’s dance background is mainly contemporary ballet, but his fascination with popular culture, music, film, and the internet has colored his approach.

<h2><strong>a hand full home - Athena travels to Ithaca</strong></h2>
<h3>A dance theatre piece adapted from Homer's First Book of the Odyssee</h3>

<p> </p>
<p><em>The Odyssey sounds familiar of course...But the First book?</em><br/><em>Ready for a refresher? </em></p>
<p>For years the Gods have been preventing Odysseys from escaping the island of Ogygia, where the beautiful sea witch, Calypso keeps him captive. Athena, the goddess with gleaming eyes, pleads with them to aid in his escape. Deciding to take action, she travels to Ithaca, where she convinces Odysseus' son, Telemachus to go on a journey to find news of his father. Seeing the chaos in Ithaca, she realizes the palace and the royal family will drown from a flood of suitors. Unless she can help get Odysseus back.</p>
<p><em>Lia´s performance unites reality and mythology:</em></p>
<p>A dancer – alone and far away from home – courageously tells her story and explores the feeling of home inside herself.<br/>And a goddess – a stranger – grips her listeners with an adventurous personal story, a quest.</p>
<p><em>And what will this all look like on stage? </em></p>
<p>Lia will present a colorful experiment of contemporary dance, object and movement theatre and of course a bit of humor. We like that.</p>
<p>The piece reflects the universal desire for coming home – wherever that may be – an emotion every one of us carries inside.</p>

The show, called 13, will be performed in the brand new Mars Black Box Theater, part of the recently-renovated WYO Performing Arts and Education Center. One of the most frequently produced new musicals of the last decade, 13 is a rollicking musical comedy featuring a cast exclusively comprised of tweens and teens. It’s a grown-up story about growing up! With an unforgettable rock score from Tony award-winning composer Jason Robert Brown, 13 is about discovering that cool is where you find it, and sometimes where you least expect it.   
We Need Your Help!
 Producing a musical is financially burdensome. Licensing, technical costs, rental fees, costumes, sets, and advertising are just a few of the many expenses for which we will be responsible. This experience will be worth every penny, but we will not be able to do it alone.While some youth theater companies require cast members to pay a steep fee for participation, we at Funny Face Productions believe that the performing arts should be accessible to all and thus will never require our players to pay out of pocket.Who We AreMy name is Emma Hall, and I’m a rising Junior at Brown University, majoring in Education Studies, and I will be directing 13. Growing up in Sheridan, taking part in local productions was a hugely formative part of my life. Theater helped me evolve from a shy, self-conscious individual to a confident, outspoken one. I’m so excited to be back in my hometown to help bring the joys of learning through the performing arts to almost two dozen young people, ages twelve to sixteen.With the invaluable support of my parents, I am establishing Funny Face Productions in order to provide theatrical opportunities for middle adolescents in northeastern Wyoming. Funny Face Productions will be a collaborative community of young people who share a passion for the performing arts.

</h3><p></p>
<p>I am <b>Giselle Suarez</b>. In 1995, my Cuban-American heart led
me to the Netherlands, where a lifelong dream of acting and
performing came true. I graduated from the Theater Academy in Utrecht
and spent over a decade playing, directing and teaching in the
European professional theater circuit.     In 2009, my
heart led me back home, to be with my mother who had been diagnosed
with a brain tumor. For nine months, I assisted her on her death
journey, an experience that changed my life drastically. This
challenging time transformed me and I was able to receive one of the
greatest gifts in my life, the 'miracle' of death.</p><p><i>""I am your destiny and you can trust me.

dying in our culture. This inspired me to create <b>THE DEATH
MONOLOGUES</b>, which unites my two arbitrary passions, theater and
death. Death permeates the life of every single human being and yet is
rarely approached, and even more rarely, approached in this way!<br/></p><p> 
The DEATH MONOLOGUES is a unique theatrical experience that
dives right into life's greatest taboo, death and dying. In this
play, Death appears as our Master of Ceremonies. He is tired of
getting a bad rap and has come to set the record straight. You will
be taken on a ride showing five unique characters' perspectives that
will shed a very different light on this subject.</p>“<i>I do not like to fight. I always win, in the end, or in the

fortunate to have  Cathy Hartenstein as the director. Cathy
holds an M.F.A in Directing from the University of Texas and has

to places such as theaters, hospice homes, cancer centers, hospitals,

DEATH MONOLOGUES at the New York Fringe Festival can bring to this
project is invaluable! It is the perfect setting to share this unique
and powerful message with a large, diverse audience and open up the
conversation to help free us from the suffering that is caused by our

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Hi - I'm Tim Crowther and this will be my first professional outing as both playwright and director. I have also taken on board a share of the production responsibilities - what can I say, I didn't feel like I'd taken enough on. And so - here I am, addressing you from within this crowdfunding site, asking for your support.</i></p>
<p><i>The piece I have written explores masculinity and (as mentioned previously), it aims to challenge our understanding of what it is to be 'manly'. Specifically, '<strong><i>tis unmanly grief </i></strong> looks at how men cope (or indeed) struggle to cope with grief, as a result of this absence of communication. </i><strong style=""font-style: italic;"">CALM</strong><i>, (The Campaign Against Living Miserably) is ""an award winning charity dedicated to preventing male suicide, the single biggest killer of men under the age of 45 in the UK"". One reason for this (they have found), is that men struggle to be emotionally open. In fact, in the male community, there is still very much a stigma attached to this very idea of sensitivity and openness. </i></p>
<p><i>It feels absolutely the right time for this project, as the themes addressed within the play are both current and hugely relevant to a twenty first century audience. You need only look as far as recent TV documentaries such as <strong>Professor Green: Suicide and Me</strong>; <strong>Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad</strong> and <strong>Diana, Our Mother</strong>, to see the importance of openness and the desperate need to address how men communicate - both in friendships and with family and loved ones.</i></p>
<p><i>It goes without saying that Theatre is the perfect platform to explore such a topic. </i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With three weeks to go until opening night, and rehearsals just round the corner, for this production to be a reality, we very much need your help. </p>
<p>It is essential that Theatre pays each and everyone of its creatives - in every aspect of a production. It is for this very reason that Theatre N16 signed an agreement with equity to be a registered equity fringe theatre venue, to make sure that actors walk away from a job, with a respectable, equity recognised, fee. </p>
<p>But for this to be possible, and to ensure we deliver a high quality production, where elements such as lighting, sound and stage design are not sacrificed, we need to raise £2,000. The money raised--added to any private investment received--will go towards:</p>
<p>- Actors' fees.</p>
<p>- Publicity (this is vital if we are to reach as wide an audience as possible). </p>
<p>- A theatre technician's fee</p>
<p>- Insurance to cover the audience and actors</p>
<p>- Costume, set and props</p>
<p>- Script printing</p>
<p>- Music rights</p>
<p>As director of the play (as well as writer and co-producer), I can honestly say that by supporting this campaign and donating, not only do you ensure that minimal sacrifices are being made when putting together the piece, but with every contribution you make (big or small), each time you alleviate a little bit of the financial burden and in effect, you become a 'backer' for the play - and to have backing (approving nods) would mean the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have already made contact with the charity CALM, and they have said (and have provided marketing material with regards to this) that the play (and its content) fully supports the work of the charity. They have also expressed an interest in assisting us to reach their target audience – people who they feel are most susceptible and/ or directly affected by the issues raised – Men under the age of 45 and close family and friends who may have also been affected. There are plans for a Q&amp;A one evening where CALM will be on the panel, and their literature will be available each night at the theatre. With your support, all this and much more can be possible through the medium of Theatre. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges of this project are the same as anyone's first fringe outing - will it be good and will it get an audience? I'm confident it will be good - the script has gone through numerous edits, workshops and readings, and I have now secured an exciting artist/ stage designer, Deborah Bowness (<a href=""https://www.deborahbowness.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.deborahbowness.com</a>), as well as what I believe to be a sterling cast: Natasha Pring, Damien Hasson and Aaron Anthony.  </p>
<p>Between myself, Jamie Eastlake of Eastlake Productions and Theatre N16 (as well as the other actors and Stage Designer), I think we have a pretty wide reach in terms of audience... and we continue to shamelessly plug away. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any donation, of any size, is massively appreciated - special thank you's and mentions is a given, so watch out on social media. However if you can't help out financially that's fine! We are equally grateful for anyone who can give us a hand by tweeting the play, following the play on Facebook, telling their friends and family, and generally helping me get the word out.</p>
<p>And of course there is no greater way to show your support for the project, than coming along to see the play - hope to see you there!</p>
